1.  Introduction

   The intent of this document is to serve as an implementor's roadmap
   for implementing various Salted Challenge Response Authentication
   Mechanism (SCRAM) [RFC5802] SASL [RFC4422] mechanisms.

   [RFC5802] defined the generic SCRAM framework and described
   instantiation of a SCRAM mechanism using SHA-1 hash function: SCRAM-
   SHA-1 (and SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS).  [RFC7677] described another
   instantiation using SHA-256 hash function (SCRAM-SHA-256 and SCRAM-
   SHA-256-PLUS) and also clarified conditions for using the mandatory-
   to-implement "tls-unique" channel binding with TLS 1.2.
   [tls-1.3-channel-binding] defines the "tls-exporter" channel binding
   that is to be used when a SCRAM mechanism is used over TLS 1.3
   [RFC8446] or later.

   [I-D.melnikov-scram-sha-512] and [I-D.melnikov-scram-sha3-512] define
   further instantiations of SCRAM using SHA-512 and SHA3-512 hash
   functions respectively.

   [I-D.melnikov-scram-2fa] defines an extension to SCRAM for two factor
   authentication.  It is applicable to all instantiations of SCRAM.

2.  Key Word Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all

3.  Implementation Recommendations

   [[Might need to rephrase this, depending on what the final version of
   "tls-1.3-channel-binding" says.]] This document updates [RFC5802] and
   [RFC7677] to use the "tls-exporter" channel binding
   [tls-1.3-channel-binding] as the mandatory to implement (instead of
   "tls-unique") when a SCRAM mechanism is used over TLS 1.3 [RFC8446]
   or later.

   [[Discuss if rough consensus can be reached on this in the KITTEN
   WG.]] All SCRAM implementations SHOULD support
   [I-D.melnikov-scram-2fa] to allow for two factor authentication with
   SCRAM.

   [[Possibly narrow down choices to only one of these.  Discuss in the
   KITTEN WG.]] Unless required for backward compatibility, server and
   client implementations MUST support SCRAM-SHA-512-PLUS/SCRAM-SHA-512
   [I-D.melnikov-scram-sha-512] and/or SCRAM-SHA3-512-PLUS/SCRAM-
   SHA3-512 [I-D.melnikov-scram-sha3-512] instead of SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS/
   SCRAM-SHA-1 [RFC5802].

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations from [RFC5802] still apply.

   To be secure, SCRAM-*-PLUS MUST be used over a TLS channel that has
   had the session hash extension [RFC7627] negotiated, or session
   resumption MUST NOT have been used.  When using SCRAM over TLS 1.2
   [RFC5246], the "tls-unique" channel binding is still the default
   channel binding to use (see Section 6.1 of [RFC5802]), assuming the
   above conditions are satisfied.  As "tls-unique" channel binding is
   not defined for TLS 1.3 [RFC8446], when using SCRAM over TLS 1.3, the
   "tls-exporter" channel binding [tls-1.3-channel-binding] MUST be the
   default channel binding (in the sense specified in Section 6.1 of
   [RFC5802]) to use.

   See [RFC4270] and [RFC6194] for reasons to move from SHA-1 to a
   strong security mechanism like SHA-512.

   The strength of this mechanism is dependent in part on the hash
   iteration-count, as denoted by "i" in [RFC5802].  As a rule of thumb,
   the hash iteration-count should be such that a modern machine will
   take 0.1 seconds to perform the complete algorithm; however, this is
   unlikely to be practical on mobile devices and other relatively low-
   performance systems.  At the time this was written, the rule of thumb
   gives around 15,000 iterations required; however, a hash iteration-
   count of 10000 takes around 0.5 seconds on current mobile handsets.
   This computational cost can be avoided by caching the ClientKey

   (assuming the Salt and hash iteration-count is stable).  Therefore,
   the recommendation of this specification is that the hash iteration-
   count SHOULD be at least 10000, but careful consideration ought to be
   given to using a significantly higher value, particularly where
   mobile use is less important.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add RFC XXXX as an extra reference for the
   following SASL SCRAM mechanisms listed in the "SASL SCRAM Family
   Mechanisms" registry: SCRAM-SHA-1, SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS, SCRAM-SHA-256
   and SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS.
