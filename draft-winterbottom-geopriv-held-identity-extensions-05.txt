Abstract

   When a Location Information Server receives a request for location
   information (using the locationRequest message), described in the
   base HTTP Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) specification, it uses the
   source IP address of arriving message as a pointer to the location
   determination process.  This is appropriate in many environments.
   However, when an entity acting on behalf of the Target would like to
   request location information then the source IP address of the
   request will lead to wrong results.  In other cases the IP address is
   not the only identifier that serves as an input to the location
   determination procedure.

   This document extends the HELD protocol to allow the location request
   message to carry additional identifiers assisting the location
   determination process.  It defines a set of URNs for Target
   identifiers and an XML containment schema.  As such, this extension
   is used in conjunction with HELD to provide Target identification.
   Examples and usage in HELD message syntax are provided.

Internet-Draft                 HELD-ID-EXT                      May 2008


1.  Introduction

   Location Configuration Protocols, such as HELD
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery], need to identify a Target
   in order to determine its location.  The base HELD specification only
   provides Target identity through the IP address of the requesting
   Target, while [I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps] provides examples of where
   this may be insufficient.  This memo defines a set of URNs and a
   containment schema that allows the entity requesting location
   information to indicate a Target identifier beyond the source IP
   address of the request.

2.  Terminology

   This document reuses the term Target, as defined in [RFC3693].

   This document uses the term Location Information Server, LIS as
   described in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Identity Extension Details

   This section defines the details of the schema extension for HELD to
   support the inclusion of a Target identity in the form of a URN or
   typed-token.  A set of URN definitions that can be used to specify
   these identities is also provided.

3.1.  URN Definitions

   The URNs defined in this section are designed to identify a Target;
   they do not identify measurements or sighting data associated with a
   Target, such as the switch and port information to which the Target
   is attached.  This information may, for example, be acquired using
   DHCP relay information [RFC3046] or LLDP [LLDP].  Device measurements
   and sighting data are described in
   [I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements].  The identity provided may
   be transitory, such as an IP address that is leased from a DHCP
   server pool.

   The URNs in the following sub-sections are defined using ABNF
   (augmented Backus-Naur form) described in [RFC2234].

3.1.1.  Ethernet MAC URN

   This is the Ethernet hardware address of the device, and is defined
   as per the IEEE 802 specifications.  The ABNF for this URN type is
   defined as:

   mac-uri = "mac:" 2*2HEXDIG 5*5macdig
   macdig = "-" 2*2HEXDIG

   This type of URN is, for example, used in RFC 4479 [RFC4479].  An
   example of its use is provided in Figure 5.

3.1.2.  IP Address URNs

   This section provides the ABNF for IP version 4 and IP version 6
   URNs.  One application of this URN scheme is described in
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps], where an outbound SIP proxy needs to
   make location requests to a LIS on behalf of a Target because, for
   some reason, the necessary information was not provided by the
   Target.

   ip-uri = "ip:" ipv4 / ipv6
   ipv4 = "IPv4+" IPv4-Address
   IPv4-Address = 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT
   ipv6 = "IPv6+" hexpart [ ":" IPv4-Address ]
   hexpart =  hexseq / hexseq "::" [ hexseq ] / "::" [ hexseq ]
   hexseq  =  hex4 *( ":" hex4)
   hex4    =  1*4HEXDIG

   An example of a location request including a URN in this form to
   identify the Target device is shown in Figure 3.

   <locationRequest
          xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held" responseTime="8">
     <locationType>geodetic</locationType>
     <deviceIdentity xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:id">
       <uri>ip:IPv4+192.0.2.5</uri>
     </deviceIdentity>
   </locationRequest>

            Figure 3: HELD Location Request Using an IP Address

   Note that the URN types are not case sensitive and the iP:ipv4+
   192.0.2.5 is still a valid URN.

3.2.  Schema

   This section defines a schema that is used to provide Target
   identifiers in a HELD location request.

   The schema provided in Figure 4 allows a URI and/or token to be
   provided so that a Target can identify itself by more than just its
   IP address.  The URI can also include an optional "type" attribute so
   that URIs that might otherwise look the same can be distinguished
   based on their usage.

   For example <uri type="gruu">sip:callee@example.com</uri> or <uri
   type="aor">sip:callee@example.com</uri>

   When the <identifier> element is used the "type" attribute is
   mandatory as it tells the LIS or receiving entity how to interpret
   the identifier.  An IANA registry is established for the central
   repository for recognized identifier types.  The set of initial types
   is provided in Section 5.3.

   A HELD location request sent by a device using the schema shown in
   Figure 4 to provide its identity as a MAC URI would look similar to
   Figure 5.

   <locationRequest xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held"
                    responseTime="8">
     <locationType>geodetic</locationType>
     <deviceIdentity xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:id">
          <uri>mac:01-ab-34-ef-69-0c</uri>
     </deviceIdentity>
   </locationRequest>

                Figure 5: HELD Location Request URI example

   Similarly a Target identifying itself using its DHCP client
   identifier (DHCP option 61 in [RFC2132]) in a location request to a
   LIS would send something similar to Figure 6.

   <locationRequest xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held"
                    responseTime="8">
     <locationType>geodetic</locationType>
     <deviceIdentity xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:id">
          <identifier type="dhcpClientId">035552764</identifier>
     </deviceIdentity>
   </locationRequest>

4.  Security Considerations

   An operator of a LIS that supports this schema extension needs to
   ensure that location provided to nodes requesting location in this
   manner are entitled to the location information being requested.  In
   some circumstances support of this schema extension will be
   inappropriate and alternative measures will need to be employed.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers an XML namespace and schema with IANA in
   accordance with guidelines in [RFC3688].  It also creates a new
   registry for device identity types, and stipulates how new types are
   to be added.

5.1.  URN Sub-Namespace Registration for
      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:id

   This section registers a new XML namespace,
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:id", as per the guidelines in
   [RFC3688].

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:id

      Registrant Contact: IETF, GEOPRIV working group,
      (geopriv@ietf.org), James Winterbottom
      (james.winterbottom@andrew.com).

   Schema:  The XML for this schema can be found as the entirety of
      Figure 4 of this document.

5.3.  Identifier 'type' Attribute values

   This document requests that the IANA create a new registry for
   identifier 'type' attribute values.  These are text strings that
   clarify how the value identifies the Device.  Referring to [RFC2434]
   this registry operates under the "Expert Review" rule.

   The following identifier types are registered as part of this memo:

   o  'dhcpClientId' The DHCP client identifier as defined by DHCP
      option 61 in [RFC2132]

   o  'msisdn' The Mobile Station International Subscriber Dial Number.
      This is an E.164 number made up of 6 to 15 digits

   o  'imsi' The International Mobile Subscriber identifier.  A unique
      identifier for GSM or UMTS mobile terminal made up of 6 to 15
      digits that identify the country code, the network code and
      device.

   o  'imei' The International Mobile Equipment identifier.  This is an
      electronic serial number for a mobile device and is consists of up
      to 15 digits

   o  'min' Mobile Identification Number.  A unique equipment identifier
      assigned to CDMA handsets.

   o  'mdn' Mobile Dial Number.  An E.164 number made up of 6 to 15
      digits.

   o  'hostname' The hostname or FQDN of the device.

   o  'directoryNumber' The directory number of the device.
