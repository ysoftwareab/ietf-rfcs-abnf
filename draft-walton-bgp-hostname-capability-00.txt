             Fully Qualified Domain Name Capability for BGP
                draft-walton-bgp-hostname-capability-00

Abstract

   In this document we propose a BGP capability that allows the
   advertisemnet of a BGP speaker's FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name).

Internet-DrafFully Qualified Domain Name Capability for BGP     May 2015


1.  Introduction

   BGP can be made much easier to troubleshoot by displaying the
   hostname of the speaker in addition to the speaker's IP address.
   This is especially true for IPv6 addresses due to their length.  If
   all BGP sessions were via global addresses then DNS could be used to
   resolve the hostname for each addresss.  BGP sessions can be via IPv6
   link-local addresses which will not have a DNS entry per Sectino 2.1
   of [RFC4472].  This document defines a new BGP capability that allows
   the exchange of a speaker's FQDN.

2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  FQDN Capability

   The FQDN Capability is a new BGP capability [RFC5492].  The
   Capability Code for this capability is specified in the IANA
   Considerations section of this document.  The Capability Length field
   of this capability is variable.  The Capability Value field consists
   of the following:

                +--------------------------------+
                |  Hostname Length (1 octet)     |
                +--------------------------------+
                |  Hostname (variable)           |
                +--------------------------------+
                |  Domain Name Length (1 octet)  |
                +--------------------------------+
                |  Domain Name (variable)        |
                +--------------------------------+

      Hostname Length:

         The number of characters in the Hostname

      Hostname:

         The hostname encoded via UTF-8

      Domain Name Length:

         The number of characters in the Domain Name

      Domain Name:

         The domain name encoded via UTF-8

4.  Operation

   The FQDN Capability SHOULD only be used for displaying the hostname
   and/or domain name of a speaker in order to make troubleshooting
   easier.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned capability number TBD for the FQDN Capability
   described in this document.  This registration is in the BGP
   Capability Codes registry.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security concerns to BGP or other
   specifications referenced in this document.
