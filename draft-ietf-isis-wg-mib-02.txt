     2.  Abstract

     This document describes a management information base for the
     IS-IS Routing protocol, as described in ISO 10589 [2], when it
     is used to construct routing tables for IP networks, as
     described in RFC 1195 [3].

     This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
     Information Base (MIB) for use with network management
     protocols in the Internet community.

     This memo is based on an IETF draft by Chris Gunner [1].  This
     version has been modified to include MIB-II syntax, to exclude
     portions of the protocol that are not relevant to IP, such as
     the ES-IS protocol, and to add management support for current
     practice.

     INTERNET DRAFT            IS-IS MIB                  June 1999

     3.  Overview

     This document is provided to the IETF working group on IS-IS.

     The IS-IS MIB includes of the following objects

       - isisSystem

            This table contains information specific to a single
            instance of the IS-IS protocol running on a router.

              - isisL2SummAddr

                   This table holds summary addresses configured
                   for each Level 2 instance of the IS-IS protocol
                   running on a router.

              - isisCirc

                   This table contains information specific to a
                   broadcast or point-to-point interface in the
                   system.

              - isisISAdj

                   This table contains information about
                   adjacencies to routers maintained by the
                   protocol.  Entries in this table cannot be
                   created by management action: they are
                   established through the Hello protocol.

              - isisISAdjIPAddr

                   This table contains the set of IP Addresses of
                   neighboring Intermediate Systems as reported in
                   received IIH PDUs.

              - isisReachAddr

                   This table contains information about an address
                   prefix manually configured on the system or
                   learned through another protocol.

              - isisIPRATable

     Expires December 1999                                 [Page 3]

     INTERNET DRAFT            IS-IS MIB                  June 1999

                   This table contains information about IP
                   reachable address manually configured on this
                   system or learned from another protocol.

              - isisIPDestTable

                   The IP Destination Table records information
                   about each destination known to the Intermediate
                   System.

     4.  Definition of IS-IS MIB

     -- This document defines an experimental portion of the MIB
     -- containing objects for managing the operation of the IS-IS
     -- protocol. The objects are mainly derived from the GDMO
     -- definitions in ISO 10589.
     --
     -- The contents of the MIB are based on a draft revision of an IETF
     -- MIB dated September 1992 and titled "Integrated IS-IS Management
     -- Information Base".
     --
     -- Portions of the orignal MIB, such as objects for ES-IS exchange,
     -- have not been included due to being inapplicable. Additionally,
     -- corrections and enhancements have been included.
     --
     -- The names of some original items have been left in the text
     -- as comments, as an indication of missing items.  Many of these
     -- are relevant to routing CLNS traffic
     --

     5.  Acknowledgments

     This draft MIB is based on March 1994 Internet Draft by Chris
     Gunnerr, who should be held blameless for the errors
     introduced since then.

     We would like to thanks the following individuals for
     constructive and valuable comments:
             Jeff Gross
             Jim Halpin
             Dimitri Haskin
             Peter Higginson

     7.  Security Considerations

     Certain management information defined in this MIB may be
     considered sensitive in some network environments.

     Therefore, authentication of received SNMP requests and
     controlled access to management information should be employed
     in such environments.
