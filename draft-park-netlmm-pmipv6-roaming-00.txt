Abstract

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is designed to provide mobility service to
   mobile nodes in the network domain that does not require the nodes to
   be involved in mobility management.  In other words, the PMIPv6 can
   support roaming within a PMIPv6 domain, i.e. intra-domain roaming,
   transparent to mobile nodes without mobility functionality.  However,
   the mobile nodes should have additional protocols such as MIPv6 for
   roaming between PMIPv6 domains, i.e. inter-domain roaming, although
   the domains also service the transparent mobility.  Hence, network-
   based solution is needed for providing transparent mobility to the
   mobile nodes that only move about between PMIPv6 domains.  This
   document specifies the inter-domain roaming mechanism controlled by
   the networks adopting the PMIPv6 protocol.

Internet-Draft  Roaming Mechanism between PMIPv6 Domains   December 2007


1.  Introduction

   PMIPv6 [I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6] is a network-based mobility
   management protocol that does not require mobile nodes to be involved
   in mobility management.  In a PMIPv6 domain, a Mobile Access Gateway
   (MAG) performs signaling with a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) for
   mobility management on behalf of mobile nodes attached to the MAG.
   The LMA functions as the home agent for the mobile nodes in the
   PMIPv6 domain.  If a mobile node moves and changes its point of
   attachment from one MAG to the other, it can still continue to use
   the same address configuration by the signaling between the MAGs and
   the LMA of the node [I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6].  In other words,
   PMIPv6 can only support roaming within a PMIPv6 domain transparent to
   mobile nodes without mobility functionality.

   Next-generation wireless networks, such as 802.16e [IEEE802.16e] and
   Super 3G/3.9G [3GPP], have the potential to run IP deeper into the
   access network than the current 3G cellular networks, similar to
   today's WLAN networks [RFC4830].  It means such various and
   heterogeneous access networks would be routed IP networks.  Also, the
   access networks would provide IP mobility by PMIPv6 since the access
   networks try to adopting PMIPv6 protocol as local mobility management
   solution specified in [3GPP] [WiMAX].  This development might lead to
   frequent roaming of mobile nodes within a PMIPv6 domain, i.e. intra-
   domain roaming, and between PMIPv6 domains, i.e. inter-domain
   roaming.

   Existing inter-domain roaming solution described in
   [I-D.giaretta-netlmm-mip-interactions] considers interworking between
   PMIPv6 and MIPv6 [RFC3775].  It means that a mobile node should have
   MIPv6 and be involved in mobility management via the MIPv6 if the
   mobile node in a PMIPv6 domain moves into another PMIPv6 domain.
   However, such involvement of mobile nodes causes several considerable
   and ironical problems as follows.

   o  If a mobile node involves MIPv6 protocol stack, the mobile node
      suffers update latency, signaling overhead, and location privacy
      problems described in [RFC4830] although the node is located in
      the domain adopting PMIPv6 proposed to solve such problems.

   o  If a mobile node involves MIPv6 protocol stack, the visited PMIPv6
      domain can not provide transparency to the mobile node though the
      domain also support transparent mobility to the mobile node in
      network-based management manner.

   o  If a mobile node that do not have MIPv6 protocol stack, the
      visited PMIPv6 domain can not provide seamless IP mobility to the
      mobile node although the domain also offers mobility management

      service.

   This document specifies roaming mechanism between PMIPv6 domains to
   provide transparent and seamless inter-domain mobility to mobile
   nodes.  In this solution, LMAs and MAGs in two domains perform
   exchange of signaling messages to mobility management on behalf of
   mobile nodes.  The signaling is performed to re-establish bi-
   directional tunnels for data flow and emulate home link of each
   mobile node.  Thus, the mobile node can maintain session continuity
   via a global unicast IPv6 address organized in home PMIPv6 domain if
   the mobile nodes move into visited PMIPv6 domain.  Namely, inter-
   domain roaming of the mobile nodes can be supported transparently in
   network-based manner like intra-domain roaming.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC3775],
   [I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6].  All user authentication and prefix
   allocation related terms are defined in [RFC2865], [RFC3588],
   [RFC4818].

   o  Home PMIPv6 Domain - This refers to the network where a mobile
      node registered to be provided the network-based mobility
      management service and the mobility management of the mobile node
      is handled using the Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol.

   o  Visit PMIPv6 Domain - This refers to any PMIPv6 network other than
      Home PMIPv6 Domain of a mobile node, to which the mobile node is
      currently connected.  Through a contact among PMIPv6 domains, it
      provides the networks-based mobility management service to mobile
      nodes of other PMIPv6 domains when they enter in it.

   o  Intra-Domain Roaming - This means that a mobile node is provided
      network-based mobility management support, without requiring the
      participation of it in any mobility related signaling when the
      mobile node moves between MAGs within a PMIPv6 domain.

   o  Inter-Domain Roaming - This means that a mobile node is provided
      network-based mobility management support, without requiring the
      participation of the mobile node in any mobility related signaling
      when the mobile node moves into other PMIPv6 domains.

   o  LMAh - This is the Local Mobility Anchor for a mobile node in the
      Home PMIPv6 domain.  It is the topological anchor point for the
      mobile node's home network prefix and manages the mobile node's
      binding state.  It has the functional capabilities of a Local
      Mobility Anchor as defined in Proxy Mobile IPv6 base specification
      [I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6] with the additional capabilities
      required for supporting the inter-domain roaming as defined in
      this specification.

   o  LMAv - This is a Local Mobility Anchor in the Visit PMIPv6 Domain
      to which a mobile node visits.  To support the network-based
      mobility management service to the mobile node, it establishes a
      bi-directional tunnel with the LMAh in the Home PMIPv6 Domain of
      the mobile node and delivers data on behalf of the mobile node
      through the tunnel.

3.  Inter-Domain Roaming Overview

   This specification describes a network-based roaming mechanism
   between Proxy Mobile IPv6 domains.  It is called Inter-Domain Roaming
   and based on Proxy Mobile IPv6[I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6].

   Inter-Domain Roaming mechanism is intended for providing network-
   based mobility management support to a mobile node, without requiring
   the participation of the mobile node in any mobility related
   signaling when the mobile node moves an access network in other proxy
   domains.

   The core functional entity in the Inter-Domain Roaming is the Local
   Mobility Anchor (LMA).  The LMA is defined as Visited LMA(LMAv) and
   home LMA(LMAh) for inter-proxy domain roaming.  LMAv is a local
   mobility anchor in visited proxy domain and LMAh is a local mobility
   anchor in home proxy domain.  The local mobility anchor is
   responsible for rechability of the mobile node and is the topological
   anchor point for home network prefix of the mobile node.

3.1.  Scenarios

   Figure 1 shows a circumstance of the roaming between PMIPv6 domains.
   A MN receives its home network prefix in a PMIPv6 home domain and
   configures its address, MN-HoA.  The MN sends and receives data by
   using the HoA during moving in the home domain.  Even though the MN
   moves into a PMIPv6 visit domain, the MN sends and receives data
   without cutoff of the session by using the MN-HoA, as the MN resides
   in the domain that PMIPv6 service is possible.

3.2.  Assumptions

   To support roaming between PMIPv6 domains, the proposed protocol
   makes the following assumptions:

   o  Through a contact among PMIPv6 domains, LMAs and MAGs can request
      authentication about hosts of other domains as well as hosts of
      its domain, to AAA.

   o  EAP and AAA protocols, RADIUS [RFC2865] or Diameter [RFC3588], can
      be used for user authentication and prefix allocation as defined
      in [RFC4818].

   o  A Network Access Identifier (NAI) of a MN, i.e.  MN-ID, used for
      user authentication and prefix allocation might be a e-mail

   o  Concatenated tunnels could be established to support inter-domain
      roaming.

4.  Roaming Mechanism Operations

4.1.  Control Plan Flow

   To support inter-domain roaming through the proposed mechanism, the
   signalings due to movement of a MN follows figure 2.  The MN within a
   home domain requests authentication to the MAGh through its NAI.
   This authentication is initiated through L2 access.  The MAGh
   requests authentication with regard to the MN' ID (foo@home) to AAAh.
   If the MN is authenticated as an authorized host, the AAAh delivers
   an LMAh address of the MN to the MAGh.  The MAGh sends Proxy Binding
   Update (PBU) message with its address, Proxy-CoAh, and the MN address
   to the LMAh.  The LMAh registers the MAGh address in regard to the MN
   and sends Proxy Binding Acknowledgement (PBA) message including a
   Home Network Prefix of the MN to the MAGh.  If the MAGh receives the
   PBA message, it is established a bi-directional tunnel between the
   LMAh and MAGh, for data from or to the MN.  The MAGh registers the
   home network prefix of the MN and sends Router Advertisement (RA)
   message including the home network prefix to the MN.  The MN on
   receiving this RA message has a valid address (MN-HoA) through
   configuring its interface with its home network prefix.  The MN sends
   and receives data through the tunnel using the MN-HoA.

   If the MN moves to the visit domain, it cannot communicate with the
   home domain.  Then, the MN again requests an authentication to an
   MAGv through L2 access.  The MAGv on receiving the authentication
   request of the MN requests authentication to an AAAv.  Because the
   AAAv knows that the MN is a host of the home domain, it again
   requests authentication to the AAAh.  The AAAh sends LMAh address to
   AAAv after the authentication in regard to the MN.  The AAAv sends
   LMAv address in regard to the MN and LMAh address sent from the AAAh,
   to the MAGv.  The MAGv sends a PBU message including its address, the
   MN' ID, and LMAh address, to the LMAv.  The LMAv registers MAGv
   address in regard to the MN and sends a PBU message including its
   address and the MN' ID to the LMAh.  The LMAh removes the previous
   tunnel in regard to the MN and re-establishes new tunnel in regard to
   the MN to LMAv.  The LMAh also sends a PBA message including the home
   network prefix of the MN to the LMAv.  The LMAv registers the
   received home network prefix and sends a PBA message including the
   prefix to the MAGv.  So, to support inter-domain roaming of the MN,
   concatenated tunnels from LMAh to LMAv and from LMAv to MAGv is
   established by exchanging the PBU and PBA messages.  The MAGv
   registers the home network prefix of the MN and sends RA messages to
   the MN.  Therefore, the MN believes it is still on the home domain,
   and sends and receives continuously data.

4.2.  Data Plan Flow

   Figure 3 shows data flow between an NM and a CN.  The data flow
   consists of a bi-directional tunnel between an MAGv and an LMAv and a
   bi-directional tunnel between the LMAv and an LMAh.  When the CN
   sends data to the MN, it includes its address and the MN address HoA
   in IP header of data packet.  The LMAh on receiving the packet from
   the CN sends the packet encapsulating its address and LMAv address to
   the LMAv.  The LMAv decapsulates the packet and sends the packet
   encapsulating its address and the MAGv address to the MAGv.  The MAGv
   decapsulates the packet to the original packet from the CN and sends
   the original packet to the MN.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document is based on the security requirements listed in
   [I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6].  The inter domain roaming requires the
   signaling message, Proxy Binding Updates and Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement, exchanged between the visited local mobility anchor
   and home local mobility anchor to be protected using IPsec, using the
   established security association between them such as between the MAG
   and the LMA in [I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6].
