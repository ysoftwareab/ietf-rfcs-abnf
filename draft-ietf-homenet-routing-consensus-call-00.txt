                     Homenet Routing Consensus Call
              draft-ietf-homenet-routing-consensus-call-00

Abstract

   In order to support arbitrary network topologies and multi-homing the
   IETF Homenet Architecture [RFC7368] requires that a routing protocol
   operates inside each home network.  For interoperability reasons it
   is necessary for there be a single "mandatory to implement" routing
   protocol.  With the Homenet Working Group unable to reach clear
   consensus on which protocol that should be the Working Group Chairs
   (with the support of the Internet Area Director) declared rough
   consensus that the chosen protocol is BABEL [RFC6126].  This document
   confirms this decision for the record.

1.  Statement

   On the 27th of October, 2015, the Working Group Chairs and the
   Internet Area Director made the following statement to the Homenet
   Mailing List:

      The Chairs believe that there is WG consensus that a single
      "mandatory to implement" routing protocol must be chosen.  We also
      believe that further delaying the direction here has long passed
      the point of diminishing returns.

      Based on the feedback received in Prague and on the WG mailing
      list thereafter, we are therefore declaring rough consensus that
      BABEL [RFC6126] shall be the "mandatory to implement" routing
      protocol for Homenet routers, albeit only on an Experimental basis
      at this time.

      The aim in making this decision is to allow the non-routing-
      protocol aspects of Homenet to move forward in the near term,
      while allowing time for additional implementation, experimentation
      and specification.  To that end, we solicit Experimental Internet
      Drafts to document Homenet-specific profiles of any applicable
      routing solution and to report results of any relevant
      experimentation and implementation.

      We expect that this decision will be revisited in a future
      Standards Track document based on specifications and running code
      available at that time.

      Vendors looking to ship Homenet routers in the near term should
      refer to [RFC6126], [RFC7557],
      [I-D.boutier-babel-source-specific], and available open source
