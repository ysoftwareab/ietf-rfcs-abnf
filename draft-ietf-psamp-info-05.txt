Internet-Draft           PSAMP Information Model            October 2006


1.  Introduction

   Packet sampling techniques are required for various measurement
   scenarios.  The packet sampling (PSAMP) protocol provides mechanisms
   for packet selection using different filtering and sampling
   techniques.  A standard way for the export and storage of such
   sampled packet data is required.  The definition of the PSAMP
   information and data model is based on the IP Flow Information eXport
   (IPFIX) protocol [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol].  The PSAMP protocol
   document [I-D.ietf-psamp-protocol] describes how to use the IPFIX
   protocol in the PSAMP context.

   This document examines the IPFIX information model [I-D.ietf-ipfix-
   info] and extends it to meet the PSAMP requirements.  Therefore, the
   structure of this document is strongly based on the IPFIX document.
   It complements the PSAMP protocol specification by providing an
   appropriate PSAMP information model.  The main part of this document,
   section 8, defines the list of Information Elements to be transmitted
   by the PSAMP protocol.  Sections 6 and 5 describe the data types and
   Information Element properties used within this document and their
   relationship to the IPFIX information model.

   The main body of section 8 was generated from a XML document.  The
   XML-based specification of the PSAMP Information Elements can be used
   for automatically checking syntactical correctness of the
   specification.  Furthermore it can be used - in combination with the
   IPFIX information model - for automated code generation.  The
   resulting code can be used in PSAMP protocol implementations to deal
   with processing PSAMP information elements.

   For that reason, the XML document that served as source for section 8
   is attached to this document in Appendix A.

   Note that although partially generated from the attached XML
   documents, the main body of this document is normative while the
   appendices are informational.

2.  PSAMP Documents Overview

   [I-D.ietf-psamp-framework]: "A Framework for Packet Selection and
   Reporting", describes the PSAMP framework for network elements to
   select subsets of packets by statistical and other methods, and to
   export a stream of reports on the selected packets to a collector.

   [I-D.ietf-psamp-sample-tech]: "Sampling and Filtering Techniques for
   IP Packet Selection", describes the set of packet selection
   techniques supported by PSAMP.

Internet-Draft           PSAMP Information Model            October 2006


   [I-D.ietf-psamp-protocol]: "Packet Sampling (PSAMP) Protocol
   Specifications" specifies the export of packet information from a
   PSAMP Exporting Process to a PSAMP Collecting Process.

   [I-D.ietf-psamp-info]: "Information Model for Packet Sampling
   Exports" (this document), defines an information and data model for
   PSAMP.

3.  Relationship between PSAMP and IPFIX

   As described in the PSAMP protocol draft [I-D.ietf-psamp-protocol] a
   PSAMP data record can be seen as a very special IPFIX Data Record.
   It represents an IPFIX flow containing only a single packet.
   Therefore, the IPFIX information model can be used as a basis for
   PSAMP reports.

   Nevertheless, there are properties required in PSAMP reports which
   cannot be modelled using the current IPFIX information model.  This
   document describes extensions to the IPFIX model which allow the
   modelling of information and data required by PSAMP.

   Some of these extensions allow the export of what may be considered
   sensitive information.  Refer to the Security Considerations section
   for a fuller discussion.

   Note that the export of sampled data may not need all the information
   elements defined by the IPFIX information model [I-D.ietf-ipfix-
   info], as discussed in sections 6.2 and 6.3 of the PSAMP Framework
   [I-D.ietf-psamp-framework].

4.2  PSAMP Terminology

   The relevant PSAMP terminology has been copied from [I-D.ietf-psamp-
   sample-tech] into this document.

   o  Observed Packet Stream

      The Observed Packet Stream is the set of all packets observed at
      the Observation Point.

   o  Selection Process

      A Selection Process takes the Observed Packet Stream as its input
      and selects a subset of that stream as its output.

   o  Packet Stream

      A packet stream denotes a subset of the Observed Packet Stream
      that flows past some specified point within the Selection Process.

   o  Population

      A population is a Packet Stream, or a subset of a Packet Stream.
      A Population can be considered as a base set from which packets
      are selected.

   o  Selector

      A Selector defines the action of a Selection Process on a single
      packet of its input.

Internet-Draft           PSAMP Information Model            October 2006


   o  Composite Selector

      A Composite Selector is an ordered composition of Selectors, in
      which the output Packet Stream issuing from one Selector forms the
      input Packet Stream to the succeeding Selector.

   o  Primitive Selector

      A Selector is primitive if it is not a Composite Selector.

4.3  IPFIX Terminology

   As the IPFIX export protocol is used to export the PSAMP information,
   the relevant IPFIX terminology from [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol] is
   copied over in this document.

   o  Observation Point

      An Observation Point is a location in the network where packets
      can be observed.

   o  Observation Domain

      An Observation Domain is the largest set of Observation Points for
      which Flow information can be aggregated by a Metering Process.

   o  Template Record

      A Template Record defines the structure and interpretation of
      fields in a Data Record.

   o  Data Record

      A Data Record is a record that contains values of the parameters
      corresponding to a Template Record.

   o  Options Template Record

      An Options Template Record is a Template Record that defines the
      structure and interpretation of fields in a Data Record, including
      defining how to scope the applicability of the Data Record.

   o  Flow Record

      A Flow Record contains information about a specific Flow that was
      observed at an Observation Point.





Dietz, et al.         draft-ietf-psamp-info-05.txt              [Page 7]

Internet-Draft           PSAMP Information Model            October 2006


   o  Metering Process

      The Metering Process generates Flow Records.

   o  Exporting Process

      The Exporting Process sends Flow Records to one or more Collecting
      Processes.  The Flow Records are generated by one or more Metering
      Processes.

   o  IPFIX Device

      An IPFIX Device hosts at least one Exporting Process.  It may host
      further Exporting processes and arbitrary numbers of Observation
      Points and Metering Process.

   o  Collecting Process

      A Collecting Process receives Flow Records from one or more
      Exporting Processes.

   o  Collector

      A device which hosts one or more Collecting Processes is termed a
      Collector.

   o  Template

      A Template is an ordered sequence of {type, length} pairs, used to
      completely specify the structure and semantics of a particular set
      of information that needs to be communicated from an IPFIX Device
      to a Collector.

   o  Information Element

      An Information Element is a protocol and encoding independent
      description of an attribute which may appear in an IPFIX Record.

5.  Properties of a PSAMP Information Element

   The PSAMP Information Elements are in accordance with the definitions
   of IPFIX.  Therefore we do not repeat the properties in this draft.
   Refer to sections 2.1 through 2.3 of the IPFIX Information Model
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info].  Nevertheless, we strongly recommend to define
   the optional "units" property for every information element (if
   applicable).





Dietz, et al.         draft-ietf-psamp-info-05.txt              [Page 8]

Internet-Draft           PSAMP Information Model            October 2006


6.  Type Space

   The PSAMP Information Elements MUST be constructed from the basic
   data types described in section 3 of the IPFIX Information Model
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info].  To avoid duplicated work and to keep
   consistency between IPFIX and PSAMP, the data types are not repeated
   in this document.

7.  Overloading Information Elements

   Information Elements won't be overloaded with multiple meanings or
   re-used for multiple purposes.  Different Information Elements will
   be allocated for each requirement.

   In particular, special information will be encoded in new Information
   Elements as necessary, and not be encoded in the selection method.

   Although the prescence of certain other Information Elements allows
   the selection method to be inferred, a separate Information Element
   is provided for the selectorAlgorithm, e.g. for including in scope
   info and depicting the contents of composites.

8.  The PSAMP Information Elements

   This section describes the Information Elements used by the PSAMP
   exporting functions.

   Each Information Element defined in section 8.2 below is allocated a
   unique identifier in accordance with section 4 of the IPFIX
   information model [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info].  The assignments are
   controlled by IANA as an extension of the IPFIX Information Model.

   The Information Elements described by the IPFIX information model
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info] are used by the PSAMP export functions where
   applicable.  To avoid inconsistencies between the IPFIX and the PSAMP
   information and data models, only those Information Elements that are
   not already described by the IPFIX information model are defined
   here.

8.1  PSAMP Usage of IPFIX Attributes

   Some Information Elements defined by the IPFIX information model are
   not needed by the PSAMP protocol.

   This section lists additional Information Elements that are needed in
   the PSAMP context and introduces their usage.

   List of additional PSAMP Information Elements:

      The parameters for most of these algorithms are defined in this
      information model.  Some parameters for these algorithms are not
      covered by this information model since they very much depend on
      the underlying hardware.

      In future, this list will be maintained by IANA.  IANA can update
      this information element as long as there's a new RFC specifying
      the algorithm and any new Information Elements which are required.

9.  Security Considerations

   The PSAMP information model itself does not directly introduce
   security issues.  Rather it defines a set of attributes which may for
   privacy or business issues be considered sensitive information.

   Specifically, the Information Elements pertaining to packet sections
   MUST target no more than the packet header, some subsequent bytes of
   the packet, and encapsulating headers if present.  Full packet
   capture of arbitrary packet streams is explicitly out of scope, per
   [RFC2804] and the PSAMP WG charter.

   The underlying protocol used to exchange the information described
   here must therefore apply appropriate procedures to guarantee the
   integrity and confidentiality of the exported information.  Such
   protocols are defined in separate documents, specifically the IPFIX
   protocol document [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol].

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines an initial set of PSAMP Information Elements as
   specified in [I-D.ietf-psamp-sample-tech], as an extension to the
   IPFIX Information Elements [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info].  New assignments
   for PSAMP Information Elements will be administered according to
   rules explained in the "IANA Consideration" section of the IPFIX
   Information Model document [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info].

   Note that the PSAMP Information Element IDs were initially started at



Dietz, et al.         draft-ietf-psamp-info-05.txt             [Page 20]

Internet-Draft           PSAMP Information Model            October 2006


   the value 300, in order to leave a gap for any ongoing IPFIX work
   requiring new Information Elements.  It is expected that this gap in
   the Information Element numbering will be filled in by IANA with new
   IPFIX Information Elements.

   Appendix B defines an XML schema which may be used to create
   consistent machine readable extensions to the IPFIX information
   model.  This schema introduces a new namespace, which will be
   assigned by IANA according to [RFC3688].

   In future the selectorAlgorithm registry will be maintained by IANA.
   IANA can update this information element as long as there's a new RFC
   specifying the algorithm and any new Information Elements which are
   required.

Appendix A.  Formal Specification of PSAMP Information Elements

   This appendix contains a formal description of the PSAMP information
   model XML document.  Note that this appendix is of informational
   nature, while the text in section Section 8 generated from this
   appendix is normative.

   Using a formal and machine readable syntax for the information model
   enables the creation of PSAMP aware tools which can automatically
   adapt to extensions to the information model, by simply reading
   updated information model specifications.

   The wide availability of XML aware tools and libraries for client
   devices is a primary consideration for this choice.  In particular
   libraries for parsing XML documents are readily available.  Also
   mechanisms such as the Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) allow for
   transforming a source XML document into other documents.  This draft
   was authored in XML and transformed according to [RFC2629].

   It should be noted that the use of XML in exporters, collectors or
   other tools is not mandatory for the deployment of PSAMP.  In
   particular, exporting processes do not produce or consume XML as part
   of their operation.  It is expected that PSAMP collectors MAY take
   advantage of the machine readability of the information model vs.
   hardcoding their behavior or inventing proprietary means for
   accommodating extensions.

   Using XML-based specifications does not currently address possible

   IANA implications associated with XML Namespace URIs.  The use of
   Namespaces as an extension mechanism implies that an IANA registered
   Namespace URI should be available and that directory names below this
   base URI be assigned for relevant IETF specifications.  The authors
   are not aware of this mechanism today.
