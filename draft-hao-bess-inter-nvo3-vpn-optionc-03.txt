Abstract

   This draft describes inter-as option-C solution between NVO3 network
   and MPLS/IP VPN network. Transport layer stitching solution should
   be provided. Also to ensure VPNv4 route exchange correctly between
   local NVE and remote PE, VNID space should be partitioned, only the
   VNIDs of lower 1 Million can be used for interconnection with outer

1. Introduction

   In cloud computing era, multi-tenancy has become a core requirement
   for data centers. Since Network Virtualization Overlays (NVO3) can
   satisfy multi-tenancy key requirements, this technology is being
   deployed in an increasing number of cloud data center network. NVO3
   focuses on the construction of overlay networks that operate over an
   IP (L3) underlay transport network. It can provide layer 2 bridging

   and layer 3 IP service for each tenant. VXLAN [RFC7348] and NVGRE
   [NVGRE] are two typical NVO3 technologies. In NVO3 network, 24-bit
   VNID (or VSID) is used to identify different virtual networks,
   theoretically 16M virtual networks can be supported in a data center.
   MPLS Over GRE and MPLS In UDP [RFC7510] are another two technologies
   to construct the overlay network, 20-bit MPLS Label is used as
   virtual networks identification. NVO3 overlay network can be
   controlled through centralized NVE-NVA architecture or through
   distributed BGP VPN protocol.

   NVO3 has good scaling properties from relatively small networks to
   networks with several million tenant systems (TSs) and hundreds of
   thousands of virtual networks within a single administrative domain.
   In a data center network, each tenant may include one or more layer
   2 virtual network. In normal case, each tenant corresponds to one
   routing domain (RD), each layer 2 virtual network corresponds to one
   or more subnets.

   To provide cloud service to external data center customers, data
   center networks should be connected to the WAN network. BGP MPLS/IP
   VPN are widely deployed technologies on WAN networks. Normally
   internal data center and external MPLS/IP VPN network are different
   Autonomous System (AS).

   In multiple NVO3 data center inter-connecting scenario, the traffic
   across data center normally are carried over BGP MPLS/IP VPN network.
   This also requires an applicable inter-as solution between NVO3
   network and external MPLS/IP network which can meet scale demands on
   existing and future NVO3 data center.

   Similar to the Inter-as connection method defined in RFC4364, there
   are three different ways of handling this case, they are option-A,
   option-B and option-C respectively in order of increasing
   scalability.

   Option-A is a back-to-back VRFs solution. Using option-A, EBGP
   session per VPN is created on peering ASBRs. In the data-plane,
   VLANs are used for tenant traffic separation. It has the lowest
   scalability among the three solutions. Compared to option-A solution,
   option-B solution has more scalability. But using option-B, ASBRs
   need to maintain and distribute all VPN prefixes. In the data plane,
   ASBRs need to perform MPLS VPN Label switching. Because MPLS VPN
   Label switching table space on ASBRs is limited, it still has
   scalability limitation for large VPN network. Option-C solution is a
   most scalable option through separating VPNv4 and PE prefixes
   exchange, the ASBRs don't need to maintain and distribute the

   customers VPN prefixes. The ASBR is only used to exchange the
   service provider(SP) internal IP.

   This draft is to propose inter-as option-C solution between NVO3
   network and external BGP MPLS/IP VPN network. Compared to the
   traditional option-C solution defined in [RFC4364], it is for
   heterogeneous network interconnection, the control plane and data
   plane procedures in NVO3 network should be newly specified.

   to VPN-Green. VNID 10 and VNID 20 are used to identify tenant1 and
   tenant2 respectively. PE1 assigned MPLS VPN Label 1000 and 2000 for
   the routes from CE1 and CE2 respectively.

4. Traditional Option-C [RFC4364] Recap

   In traditional Option-C defined in [RFC4364], an MP-EBGP session
   between the end PEs in source and destination ASs is used for the
   redistribution of VPN-IPv4 routes. Labeled IPv4 routes are
   redistributed by EBGP between neighboring autonomous systems ,
   inter-AS Option-C uses BGP as the label distribution protocol.
   Through this solution, VPN connectivity is maintained while keeping
   VPN-IPv4 routes out of the ASBRs, an ASBR only need maintain labeled
   IPv4/32 routes to the PE routers within its AS. If the /32 routes
   for the PE routers are NOT made known to the P routers(other than
   the ASBRs), then a packet's ingress PE need to put a three-label
   stack on it. The bottom label is assigned by the egress PE,
   corresponding to the packet's destination address in a particular
   VRF.  The middle label is assigned by the ASBR, corresponding to the
   /32 route to the egress PE.  The top label is assigned by the
   ingress PE's IGP Next Hop, corresponding to the /32 route to the
   ASBR.

5. Inter-As Option-C Solution

   Each NVE operates as default layer 3 gateway to connect locally
   attached TS(s). VRFs are created on each NVE to isolate IP data
   plane forwarding table  between various attached  tenants. The
   VNID(or VSID and MPLS Label) is used as Tenant identification .

   Similar to traditional Option-C defined in [RFC4364], an end to end
   tunnel path from NVE to PE as transport layer should be established
   through EBGPs (ASBR-ASBR) and two IBGPs in local DCs (between ASBR-
   PE and ASBR-NVE), and MP-BGP will be established over the tunnel so
   that VPN-IPv4 routes can be exchanged between the NVE and PE without
   AS awareness. Unlike traditional Option-C BGP label switched path,
   the tunnel path has two segments, one segment is the NVO3 tunnel
   from NVE to ASBR-d in NVO3 network, another segment is traditional
   BGP LSP from ASBR-d to PE in WAN network, the two segments should be
   stitched together at ASBR-d as per recommended implementation. The
   behavior on ASBR-w and PEs in MPLS VPN network has no implementation
   differences compared to the behavior of ASBR and PEs in traditional
   RFC4364 based MPLS VPN Option-C network.

5.1. EBGP process for transport layer stitching

   This section will describe the EBGP procedures for the transport
   layer forwarding path stitching.

   In WAN to DC direction, when ASBR-d receives labeled IPv4/32 routes
   from ASBR-w, one of the several allocation methods can be used for
   tunnel stitching among them few are IP, UDP port  and GRE key
   allocation method . The method chosen by operator depends on the
   data center network type and the network scale. For the UDP based
   network of VXLAN [RFC7348] and MPLS In UDP [RFC7510], either IP
   allocation method or UDP port allocation method can be used. UDP
   port allocation should be within UDP ephemeral port range and one
   UDP port maps to a label. For NVGRE network, only IP allocation
   method can be used. For MPLS Over GRE network, either IP allocation
   method or GRE key allocation method can be used.

   In DC to WAN direction, the transport layer stitching solution is
   same for all kinds of NVO3 network. In this solution, ASBR-d
   announces labeled IPv4/32 routes to ASBR-w for each NVE where unique
   MPLS Label is allocated. . The allocated MPLS Label and NVE IP
   address mapping forms incoming forwarding table which is used to
   stitch BGP LSP and NVO3 tunnel for inbound traffic forwarding, i.e.,
   from external DC to internal DC.



5.1.1. UDP based overlay network

   Both VXLAN and MPLS In UDP are UDP based encapsulations. For the
   outbound traffic from NVE to ASBR-d, there are two options at ASBR-d,
   i.e., the ASBR-d only accepts the traffic with standard destination
   UDP port(4789 for VXLAN [RFC7348], 6635 for MPLS In UDP [RFC7510])
   or non-standardized destination UDP port in outer UDP header
   encapsulation.

   In WAN to DC direction, if standard destination UDP port solution is
   used, when ASBR-d receives labeled IPv4/32 routes from ASBR-w, IP
   address allocation method should be used. The ASBR allocates an IP
   address per MPLS Label specified for a particular route defined in
   [RFC3107] to identify each remote PE, and then advertises the
   IPv4/32 route(indicating remote PE reachability) to all local NVEs
   with the VXLAN or MPLS In UDP tunnel attribute. [TUNNELENCAP]
   defines the relevant TLVs and sub-TLVs for the Tunnel Encapsulation
   Attribute. The local NVEs will encapsulate transport layer header
   using the Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute for the outbound traffic
   from internal DC to external DC, the  ASBR-d generated IP is the


Hao & et,al            Expires March 10, 2016                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft            Inter-As Option-C             September 2015


   destination IP in NVO3 tunnel outer header, the UDP port is the
   standard well-known port for VXLAN and MPLS In UDP. The IP pool
   should be configured beforehand on ASBR-d. The new allocated IP and
   MPLS Label mapping forms outgoing forwarding table on ASBR-d which
   is used to stitch NVO3 tunnel and BGP LSP for outbound traffic
   forwarding . If non-standard destination UDP port is used, ASBR-d
   can allocate the combination of IP and UDP port(or only UDP port)
   per MPLS Label to identify each remote PE, and then advertises the
   IPv4/32 route received from ASBR-w to all local NVEs with the Tunnel
   Encapsulation Attribute. For each NVE, the destination IP and the
   destination port in NVO3 tunnel outer header is the new allocated IP
   and the new allocated port respectively. The new allocated IP and
   UDP port combination (or only UDP port) and MPLS Label mapping
   forms outgoing forwarding table on ASBR-d. This method is called UDP
   allocation method, the allocated UDP port range should be configured
   beforehand on ASBR-d.

   In summary, IP allocation method has more IP address consumption
   than the UDP allocation method. If there is large number of remote
   PEs in WAN network, the UDP allocation method is suggested to be
   used to enhance network scalability.

5.1.2. GRE based overlay network

   Both NVGRE and MPLS Over GRE are GRE based encapsulations. The GRE
   key field can be used to convey application-specific key value. In
   NVGRE, the key field has been used to convey 24-bit Virtual Subnet
   Identifier (VSID) as tenant identification, so for NVGRE, the GRE
   key field can't be used for the stitching purpose and only IP
   allocation method can be used. In MPLS Over GRE, the GRE key field
   has not been used explicitly by an application and can be used for
   the transport layer stitching at ASBR-d, i.e., GRE key allocation
   method can be used to conserve IP address space.

   In WAN to DC direction, for MPLS Over GRE, when ASBR-d receives
   labeled IPv4/32 routes from ASBR-w, the ASBR can allocate a GRE key
   per MPLS Label to identify each remote PE, and then advertises the
   IPv4/32 route to all local NVEs with the Tunnel Encapsulation
   Attribute. The new allocated GRE key and MPLS Label correspondence
   forms outgoing forwarding table on ASBR-d. This method is called GRE
   key allocation method.



   If ASBR-d needs to change IP address, UDP port or GRE key for a
   particular /32 route, it should advertising a new route with the

   same NLRI and a new Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute to refresh all
   NVEs's local information.

5.2. VPN routes exchange

   Each NVE and remote PE should establish MP-EBGP session for the
   announcement of VPN-IPv4 routes through RFC4364. Route
   distinguishers (RD) and RT are specified for each VRF on each NVE
   and PE.

   Each NVE advertises all local VPN route to remote PEs using tenant
   identification VNID (or VSID and MPLS Label) as MPLS VPN Label.
   These remote PEs deal with the NVE as regular PE, they match RT and
   populates these VPN route to local VRF. For the traffic from remote
   CE to local TS, ingress PE uses the VNID as bottom label in MPLS
   encapsulation. Because VNID field is 24 bits, to ensure these NVEs
   and PEs interworking, VNID length should not be beyond 20 bits, i.e.,
   VNID value must not be larger than 1 Million. In proposed
   implementation NVO3 network the VNID space should be partitioned,
   only the VNIDs of lower 1 Million can be used for interconnection
   with outer MPLS VPN network, the rest 15 Million VNIDs can only be
   used for intra DC.

   Each MPLS VPN PE also advertises all local VPN route to peer NVEs,
   these NVEs match RT and populates these VPN route to local VRF. For
   the traffic from local TS to remote CE, because ingress NVE doesn't
   support MPLS encapsulation, it encoded the MPLS VPN Label advertised
   from remote PE as VNID in NVO3 encapsulation.

5.3. Data forwarding process

   When VXLAN network and UDP port allocation method are used in data
   center, the procedures of data forwarding between TS1 and CE1 in
   figure 1 will be described step by step as follows.

5.3.1. Data flow from TS1 to CE1

   1. TS1 sends a packet to NVE1, destination IP is CE1's IP.

   2. NVE1 acquires local VRF relying on packet input interface, then
      looks up the VRF's routing table corresponding to tenant 1,
      performs NVO3 encapsulation, and sends the encapsulated packet
      out to ASBR-d. The MPLS VPN Label associated with the packet's
      destination address is encoded in VNID field. VXLAN tunnel
      destination IP and destination UDP port are the IP address and
      UDP port allocated on ASBR-d associated with the /32 routes for
      the remote PE routers that the remote CE attached to.

   3. ASBR-d decapsulates the VXLAN  received packet and performs MPLS
      encapsulation. Two Labels should be pushed in the MPLS
      encapsulation, BGP LSP Label as top Label and MPLS VPN Label as
      bottom Label. BGP LSP Label is acquired by looking up outgoing
      stitching table, MPLS VPN Label is copied from VNID.

   4. ASBR-w swaps BGP MPLS Label, and push IGP Label and sends the
      packet out to PE1. MPLS VPN Label remains unchanged.

   5. PE1 pops all MPLS Label, finds local VRF relying on bottom MPLS
      VPN Label, performs looks up in local VRF IP forwarding table ,
      and then sends the packet out to CE1.

5.3.2. Data flow from CE1 to TS1

   1. CE1 sends a packet to PE1, destination IP is TS1's IP.

   2. PE1 acquires local VRF interface relying on packet input
      interface where CE1 egress out the packet, then launches a lookup
      in VRF's routing table. It pushes three-label stack on the
      outgoing packet. The bottom label is the tenant VNID corresponds
      to TS1, the VNID is 10. The middle label is assigned by the ASBR-
      w, associating with the /32 route for the egress NVE1. The top
      label is assigned by the ingress PE's IGP Next Hop, corresponding
      to the /32 route to ASBR-w.

   3. ASBR-w pops top IGP Label, swaps middle BGP Label, and then sends
      the packet out to ASBR-d.

   4. ASBR-d decapsulates MPL packet, performs VXLAN encapsulation and
      then sends the packet to egress NVE1. The egress NVE's IP address
      is acquired  by performing a looking up in  the stitching table,
      VNID is copied from the bottom MPLS VPN Label.

   5. NVE1 decapsulates incoming NVO3 encapsulated packet, looks up
      local VRF interface based on VNID, then performs a look up in the
      routing table and forwards the packet out to destination TS1.



6. NVE-NVA architecture

   In this architecture, the NVE control plane and forwarding
   functionality are decoupled. All NVEs in NVO3 network don't need to
   support BGP protocol; these NVEs have only data plane functionality
   and are controlled by centralized NVA using openflow, ovsdb, i2rs,
   etc. The NVA runs BGP with ASBR-d to exchange plain IP route to

   IPv4/32 of each WAN PE associated with the BGP tunnel encapsulation
   attribute. The NVA also runs MP-BGP protocol [RFC4364] with peer PE
   for all the NVEs to exchange VPNv4 route, VNID is used as MPLS VPN
   Label. ASBR-d can choose IP allocation, UDP allocation or GRE key
   allocation method for the transport stitching.

   NVA maintains all tenant information, and originates BGP routes with
   the appropriate RD and RT.  The NVA tenant information includes
   VNID(or VSID and MPLS Label) to identify each tenant and the
   corresponding RD and RT. This information can be statically
   configured by operators or dynamically allocated. This information
   also includes all TS's MAC/IP address and its attached NVE
   information.

6.1. EBGP process for transport layer stitching

   DC to WAN direction:

   1. ASBR-d allocates BGP MPLS Label per NVE.

   2. ASBR-d advertises BGP Label routing information to peer ASBR-w.
      ASBR-d generates incoming stitching table <new allocated BGP MPLS
      Label, NVE IP>.

   WAN to DC direction:

   1. ASBR-d receives BGP Label routing information from peer ASBR-w.

   2. ASBR-d allocates NVO3 Tunnel IP, UDP port or GRE key for each
      MPLS Label received from ASBR-w, the ASBR-d announces the IPv4/32
      Route to NVA with the Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute.

   3. ASBR-d generates outgoing stitching table<new allocated Tunnel
      IP(or UDP port and GRE key), received MPLS Label>.

6.2. VPN route exchange

     NVA advertises all internal data center tenant routing information
     to remote PEs using RFC 4364, which includes RD, RT, IP prefix,
     and MPLS VPN Label, the tenant identification of VNID is used as
     MPLS VPN Label.

     Each remote MPLS VPN PE also advertises local VPN routes to NVA.
     NVA acquires NVO3 Tunnel IP(or UDP port and GRE key) allocated by

     ASBR-d corresponding to the PE, matches RT attribute and populates
     the VPN routes to local VRF.

     Then the NVA downloads corresponding VPN forwarding table
     including <destination IP prefix/Mask, NVO3 Tunnel IP(or UDP port
     and GRE key), VNID>to each NVE.

7. Security Considerations

   Internal IP (Loopback IP for PE/NVE) addresses a network is
   advertised and visible in another network, which is a security risk.
   Most operators wants to prevent any external visibility and access
   into their internal devices IP. option C is suggested to be deployed
   within a single SP or enterprise with both MPLS and NVO3 networks.

8. IANA Considerations

   NA.
