1. INTRODUCTION

     This memo describes the IPv6 Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP).
   ESP seeks to provide integrity and confidentiality to IPv6 datagrams.
   It may also provide authentication, depending on which algorithm and
   algorithm mode are used.  Non-repudiation and protection from traffic
   analysis are not provided by ESP.  The IPv6 Authentication Header (AH)
   might provide non-repudiation if used with certain authentication
   algorithms.  The IPv6 Authentication Header may be used in conjunction
   with ESP to provide authentication.  Users desiring integrity and
   authentication without confidentiality should use the IPv6
   Authentication Header (AH) instead of ESP.  This document assumes that
   the reader is familiar with the related document "IPv6 Security
   Architecture", which defines the overall security architecture for
   IPv6 and provides important background for this specification.

1.1 OVERVIEW

     The IPv6 Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) seeks to provide
   confidentiality and integrity by encrypting data to be protected and
   placing the encrypted data in the data portion of the IPv6
   Encapsulating Security Payload.  Either a transport-layer (e.g. UDP or
   TCP) frame may be encrypted or an entire IPv6 datagram may be
   encrypted, depending on the user's security requirements.
   Encapsulating the protected data is necessary to provide
   confidentiality for the entire original datagram, but can be very
   expensive to implement.  Use of this specification will increase the
   IPv6 protocol processing costs in participating systems and will
   also increase the communications latency.  The increased latency is
   primarily due to the encryption and decryption required for each IPv6
   datagram containing an Encapsulating Security Payload.

     In order for ESP to work properly without changing the entire
   Internet infrastructure (e.g. non-participating systems), the original
   IPv6 datagram is placed in the encrypted portion of the Encapsulating
   Security Payload and that entire ESP frame is placed within an
   datagram having unencrypted IPv6 headers.  The information in the
   unencrypted IPv6 headers is used to route the secure datagram from
   origin to destination. An unencrypted IPv6 Routing Header might be
   included between the IPv6 Header and the Encapsulating Security
   Payload.  An IPv6 Authentication Header may be present both as an
   header of the unencrypted IPv6 packet and also as a header within the
   encrypted IPv6 packet.  In such a case, the unencrypted Authentication
   Header is primarily used to provide protection for the contents of the
   unencrypted IPv6 headers and the encrypted Authentication Header is
   used to provide authentication for the encrypted IPv6 packet.

     The encapsulating security payload is structured a bit differently
   than other IPv6 payloads. The first component of the ESP payload
   consist of the unencrypted field(s) of the payload.  The second
   component consists of encrypted data.  The field(s) of the unencrypted
   ESP header inform the intended receiver how to properly decrypt and
   process the encrypted data.  The encrypted data component includes
   protected fields for the security protocol and also the encrypted
   encapsulated IPv6 datagram.

2. KEY MANAGEMENT

     Key management is an important part of the IPv6 security
   architecture.  However, it is not included in this specification
   because of a long history in the public literature of subtle flaws  in
   key management algorithms and protocols.  IPv6 tries to decouple
   the key management mechanisms from the security protocol mechanisms.
   The only coupling between the key management protocol and the security



Atkinson                                                        [Page 2]

Internet Draft                                           4 November 1994


   protocol is with the Security Association Identifier (SAID), which is
   described in more detail below.  This decoupling permits several
   different key management mechanisms to be used.  More importantly, it
   permits the key management protocol to be changed or corrected without
   unduly impacting the security protocol implementations. Thus, IPv6 key
   management is specified in a separate (TBD) draft.

   [NB: It is intended that the key management mechanisms being developed in
   the IETF's Key Management Working Group and DNS Security Working Group
   will be reused for IPv6. ]

     The key management mechanism is used to negotiate a number of
   parameters for each security association, including not only the keys
   but other information (e.g. the cryptographic algorithms and modes)
   used by the communicating parties.  The key management protocol
   implementation usually creates and maintains a table containing the
   several parameters for each current security association. An ESP
   implementation normally needs to read that security parameter table to
   determine how to process each datagram containing an ESP (e.g. which
   algorithm/mode and key to use).

3. ENCAPSULATING SECURITY PAYLOAD SYNTAX

     The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) may appear anywhere after
   the IPv6 header.  The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority has assigned
   Protocol Number 50 to IPv6 ESP.  Thus the header immediately preceding
   the ESP header will always contain the value 50 in its Next Header
   field.  ESP consists of an unencrypted header followed by encrypted
   data.  The encrypted data includes both the protected ESP header
   fields and the protected user data, which is either an entire IPv6
   datagram or an upper-layer protocol frame (e.g. TCP or UDP).  A
   high-level diagram of a secure IPv6 datagram follows.

     |<--        Unencrypted              -->|<----    Encrypted   ------>|

   After decryption, the data transmitted in the above "Encrypted Data" field
   is formatted as follows:

     +-------------+--------------------+-----------------+----------------+
     | Next Header |  Header Length     |              Reserved            |
     +-------------+--------------------+-----------------+----------------+
     | Protected data (either an entire IPv6 datagram                      |
     |                  or a UDP frame or a TCP frame), variable length    |
     +-------------+--------------------+-----------------+----------------+

3.1 CLEARTEXT FIELDS
     The IPv6 Header is the conventional IPv6 Header defined by others in
   a separate Internet Draft.  The ESP unencrypted field(s) are as follows:

   _S_E_C_U_R_I_T_Y _A_S_S_O_C_I_A_T_I_O_N _I_D_E_N_T_I_F_I_E_R (_S_A_I_D)
        A 32-bit value identifying the security association for this
      datagram.  If no security association has been established, the value
      of this field shall be 0x0000.  A security association is normally
      one-way.  An authenticated communications session between two hosts
      will normally have two SAIDs in use (one in each direction).  The
      receiving host uses the combination of SAID value and originating
      address to distinguish the correct association.  An ESP implementation
      will always be able to use the SAID in combination with the 128-bit
      Destination Address to determine the security association and related
      security configuration data for all valid incoming packets.

        Senders to a multicast group may share a common SAID for all
      communications if all communications are authenticated using the same
      security configuration parameters (e.g. algorithm, key, etc.).  In
      this case, the receiver only knows that the message came from a host
      knowing the security association data for the group and cannot
      authenticate which member of the group sent the datagram.  Multicast
      groups may also use a separate SAID for each sender.  In any event,
      the combination of Destination Address and SAID is used to determine
      the correct security association data.  If each sender is keyed
      separately and asymmetric algorithms are used, data origin
      authentication is also a provided service.

        Each SAID value implies the key(s) used to encrypt and decrypt the
      encrypted portion of the ESP payload, the sensitivity level (e.g.
      Secret, Unclassified) of the user data in the ESP payload, the
      encryption algorithm being used, the block size (if any) of the
      encryption algorithm, the authentication algorithm being used (if
      separate from the encryption algorithm), the block size (if any) of
      the authentication algorithm, and the presence/absence and size of a
      cryptographic synchronisation or initialisation vector field at the
      start of the encrypted portion of the ESP (if no such field is
      present, then the size is of course zero).



Atkinson                                                        [Page 4]

Internet Draft                                           4 November 1994


   _S_Y_N_C_H_R_O_N_I_S_A_T_I_O_N _D_A_T_A
        This field is present only for algorithms which require a
      cryptographic synchronisation field for each packet.  The value of
      this field is arbitrary.  The length of this field is variable, though
      for any given algorithm it has a particular known length.  It is
      considered to be plaintext in this document, though most users will
      not be able to make sense of its contents.  Its presence or absence
      and its size are constant for all secure datagrams of any given SAID
      value.  The ESP specification includes this field so that the payload
      specification will be independent of the cryptographic algorithm that
      is being used by the communicating systems.  If present, the field
      contains cryptographic synchronisation data, such as a DES
      Initialisation Vector, for whichever algorithm is in use. [2] An ESP
      implementation will normally use the Security Association Identifier
      value for the payload being processed to determine whether this field
      is present and to determine the field's size and use if present.

3.2 ENCRYPTED FIELDS
   The ESP encrypted fields are as follows:

_N_E_X_T _H_E_A_D_E_R
     This field contains the value indicating which header follows the
   ESP Encrypted Fields.  For example, if an entire IP datagram follows,
   the field will contain the number 94, which has been allocated by IANA
   to indicate IP-in-IP encapsulation.  [cite Assigned Numbers RFC]

_H_E_A_D_E_R _L_E_N_G_T_H
     This field is contains the length of the set of encrypted ESP fields
   (i.e. Next Header, Header Length, Reserved) minus the 8 byte minimum
   length.  The minimum length is 64-bit aligned to comply with normal
   IPv6 alignment rules.

_R_E_S_E_R_V_E_D
     This field is currently used primarily for padding out to 64-bit
   alignment but might be used for other purposes in the future.  It MUST
   be set to zero on transmission and MUST be ignored upon receipt.  It
   is 16 bits long.

     It is important that all routing headers and other data be included
   within the encrypted IPv6 datagram, even if the same data is in the
   unencrypted part of the IPv6 datagram.  The receiving system shall
   ignore all routing information in the unencrypted portion of the
   received datagram and shall strictly rely on the routing information
   from the protected payload instead.  If this rule is not strictly
   adhered to, then the system will be vulnerable to various kinds of
   attacks, including source routing attacks.  The encrypted IPv6
   datagram may contain an explicit IPv6 Sensitivity Label (which is not
   yet defined) but the encrypted IPv6 datagram need not include the IPv6



Atkinson                                                        [Page 5]

Internet Draft                                           4 November 1994


   Sensitivity Label because the SAID indicates the sensitivity label for
   the encrypted IPv6 datagram.  If it is necessary to pad the protected data
   (e.g. to an integral block-size of the cryptographic algorithm in use),
   then the normal IPv6 Pad header is used to provide that padding.  This
   means that ESP will not work with block oriented algorithms whose block
   size is not an integral number of 8-bit bytes.

4. ENCAPSULATING SECURITY PROTOCOL PROCESSING
     This section describes the steps taken when ESP is in use between
   two communicating parties.  Multicast is different from unicast only
   in the area of key management (See the definition of the SAID, above,
   for more detail on this).  There are two modes of use for ESP.  The
   first mode, which is called "IP-mode", encapsulates an entire IP
   datagram inside ESP.  This mode also works well for the case where one
   wants to send an encrypted ICMP or IGMP message.  The second mode,
   which is called "Transport-Mode", encapsulates a transport-layer
   (i.e. UDP or TCP) frame inside ESP.  This section describes protocol
   processing for each of these modes.

4.1 ESP in IP-mode

     The sender takes the original IPv6 datagram, encapsulates it into
   the ESP and then applies the encryption algorithm using the
   appropriate key for the receiving party.  If no key has been
   established, then the key management mechanism is used to establish a
   encryption key for this communications session prior to the
   encryption.  The (now encrypted) ESP is then encapsulated in a
   cleartext IPv6 datagram as the last payload.  If strict red/black
   separation is being enforced, then the addressing and other
   information in the cleartext IPv6 headers and optional payloads might
   be different from the values contained in the (now encrypted and
   encapsulated) original datagram.

     The receiver strips off the cleartext IPv6 header and cleartext
   optional IPv6 payloads (if any) and discards them.  It then decrypts
   the ESP using the session key that has been established for this
   traffic.  If no encryption key exists for this session, the encrypted
   ESP is discarded and the failure is recorded in the system or audit
   log, including the cleartext values for the SAID, date/time, Sending
   Address, Destination Address, and the Flow ID.  The original IPv6
   datagram is then removed from the (now decrypted) ESP.  This original
   IPv6 datagram is then processed as per the normal IPv6 protocol
   specification.  In the case of a B1 or Compartmented Mode Workstation,
   additional appropriate mandatory access controls should be applied.

Internet Draft                                           4 November 1994


4.2 ESP in Transport-mode

     The sender takes the original UDP or TCP frame, encapsulates it into
   the ESP and then applies the encryption algorithm using the
   appropriate key for the receiving party.  If no key has been
   established, then the key management mechanism is used to establish a
   encryption key for this communications session prior to the
   encryption.  The (now encrypted) ESP is then encapsulated as the last
   payload of a cleartext IPv6 datagram.

     The receiver processes the cleartext IPv6 header and cleartext
   optional IPv6 headers (if any) and temporarily stores pertinent
   information (e.g. source and destination addresses, Flow ID, Routing
   Header).  It then decrypts the ESP using the session key that has been
   established for this traffic.  If no encryption key exists for this
   session, the encrypted ESP is discarded and the failure is recorded in
   the system or audit log, including the cleartext values for the SAID,
   date/time received, Sending Address, Destination Address, and the Flow
   ID.  The original UDP or TCP frame is then removed from the (now
   decrypted) ESP.  The information from the cleartext IPv6 header and
   the now decrypted UDP or TCP header is jointly used to determine which
   application the data should be sent to.  The data is then sent along
   to the appropriate application as normally per IPv6 protocol
   specification.  In the case of a B1 or Compartmented Mode Workstation,
   additional Mandatory Access Controls should be appropriately applied.

4.3. Combining ESP and the Authentication Header

     This section describes how to combine the Encapsulating Security
   Protocol with Authentication Header.  There are two different
   approaches, depending on which part of the data is to be
   authenticated.  The location of the IPv6 Authentication Header makes
   it clear which set of data is being authenticated.

     In the first usage, the entire received datagram is authenticated,
   including both the encrypted and unencrypted portions, while only the
   data sent after the ESP Header is confidential.  In this usage, the
   sender first applies ESP to the data being protected.  Then the other
   plaintext IPv6 headers are prepended to the ESP header and its now
   encrypted data. Finally, the IPv6 Authentication Header is calculated
   over the resulting datagram according to the normal method.  Upon
   receipt, the receiver first verifies the authenticity of the entire
   datagram using the normal IPv6 Authentication Header process.  Then if
   authentication succeeds, decryption using the normal IPv6 ESP process
   occurs.  If decryption is successful, then the resulting data is
   passed up to the upper layer.

     If the authentication process were to be applied only to the data
   protected by IPv6 ESP and the protected data were an entire IPv6
   datagram, then the IPv6 Authentication Header would be placed normally
   within that protected datagram.  However, if the protected data were
   less than an entire IPv6 datagram, then the IPv6 Authentication Header
   would be placed within the encrypted payload immediately after the ESP
   protected header and before any other header or the UDP or TCP frame.

6. TYPICAL USE

     The ESP supports security between two or more hosts implementing
   ESP, between two or more gateways implementing ESP, and between a host
   or gateway implementing ESP and a set of hosts and/or gateways.  A
   security gateway is a system which acts as the communications gateway
   between external untrusted systems and trusted hosts on their own
   subnetwork and provides security services for the trusted hosts when
   they communicate with external untrusted systems.  A trusted
   subnetwork contains hosts and routers that trust each other not to
   engage in active or passive attacks and trust that the underlying
   communications channel (e.g. an Ethernet) isn't being attacked.
   Trusted systems always should be trustworthy, but in practice they
   often are not trustworthy.

     In the case where a security gateway is providing services on behalf
   of one or more hosts on a trusted subnet, the security gateway is
   responsible for establishing the security association on behalf of its
   trusted host and for providing security services between the security



Atkinson                                                        [Page 8]

Internet Draft                                           4 November 1994


   gateway and the external system(s).  In this case, only the gateway
   need implement ESP, while all of the systems behind the gateway on the
   trusted subnet may take advantage of ESP services between the gateway
   and external systems.  A gateway which receives a datagram containing
   a recognised sensitivity label from a trusted host should take that
   label's value into account when creating/selecting an SAID for use
   with ESP between the gateway and the external destination.  A gateway
   which receives a IPv6 packet containing the ESP should appropriately
   label the decrypted packet that it forwards to the trusted host that
   is the ultimate destination.  The IPv6 Authentication Header should
   always be used on packets containing explicit sensitivity labels to
   ensure end-to-end label integrity.

     If there are no security gateways present in the connection, then
   two end systems that implement ESP can use it to encrypt only the user
   data (e.g. TCP or UDP) being carried between the two systems.  ESP is
   designed to provide all this flexibility so that users may select and
   use only the security that they desire and need.

     Others have developed an Informational document describing how IPv6
   security may be supported as part of a Sockets API. [15]

7. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

     This entire draft discusses a security mechanism for use with IPv6.
   This mechanism is not a panacea, but it does provide an important
   component useful in creating a secure internetwork.

     Users need to understand that the quality of the security provided
   by this specification depends completely on the strength of whichever
   encryption algorithm that has been implemented, the correctness of
   that algorithm's implementation, upon the security of the key
   management mechanism and its implementation, the strength of the key
   [16] and upon the correctness of the ESP and IPv6 implementations in
   all of the participating systems. If any of these assumptions do not
   hold, then little or no real security will be provided to the user.
   Use of high assurance development techniques is recommended for the
   IPv6 Encapsulating Security Payload.

     Users seeking protection from traffic analysis might consider the use
   of appropriate link encryption.  Description and specification of link
   encryption is outside the scope of this note.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

     Many of the concepts here are derived from or were influenced by the
   US Government's SP3 security protocol specification, the ISO/IEC's

APPENDIX A: Use of CBC-Mode DES with IPv6 ESP

     This appendix describes the application of the Cipher Block Chaining
   (CBC) mode of the US Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm to the
   IPv6 Encapsulating Security Payload.  This mode of DES requires an
   Initialisation Vector that is 8 bytes long and requires that the
   encrypted data be a multiple of 8 bytes long.  DES is described is
   several US Government publications. [10, 11, 12, 13] A recent book
   also provides information on DES. [14]  That same reference indicates
   on page 231 that at least one hardware implementation of DES CBC
   can encrypt or decrypt at about 1 Gbps.

     Each ESP header shall contain a 64-bit DES Initialisation Vector in
   the Cryptographic Synchronisation field when DES-CBC is in use.  Each
   packet needs to contain its own different DES Initialisation Vector.
   Including the Initialisation Vector in each packet also ensures
   decryption of each received packet can be performed even though other
   packets might have been dropped or packets might have been misordered
   in transit.  The method for selection of the Initialisation Vector
   value is implementation-defined.

     The secret DES key shared between the communicating parties is 64
   bits long, as per the DES specifications [10, 11, 12, 13]. The 64-bit
   DES key consists of a 56-bit quantity used by the DES algorithm and 8
   parity bits arranged such that one parity bit is the least significant
   bit of each octet.

     The length of the octet sequence to be encrypted by the DES
   algorithm must be an integral multiple of 8.  When encrypting, any
   needed padding shall be included by using a IPv6 hop-by-hop padding
   option.  When the Transport-mode of ESP is used, such padding must
   appear between the encrypted ESP header fields and the start of the
   UDP or TCP data.  If the length of the octet sequence to be decrypted
   is not an integral multiple of 8 octets, then processing shall be
   halted, the packet shall be discarded, and the event shall be audited
   using implementation-specific methods.
