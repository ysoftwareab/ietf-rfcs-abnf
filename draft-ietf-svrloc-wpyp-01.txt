Abstract

   This document presents definitions for the 'wp:' (white pages) and
   'yp:' (yellow pages) abstract services.

1. Introduction

   In "Advertising Services" [1], several abstract services are
   proposed. As specified in [2], the "wp:" (white pages) and "yp:"
   yellow pages abstract services are documented here.


2. The "wp" Abstract Service

   The "wp" abstract service is for locating people via directory or
   "white pages" services.  Version 0.0 of this service specifies four
   protocols for accessing such services: LDAP, WHOIS++, CCSO/Ph and
   HTTP.

3. The "yp" Abstract Service

   To locate resource on the Internet, a client would use the "Yellow
   Pages" service and version 0.0 of the "yp" abstract service specifies
   two protocols for accessing such services: Z39.50 and HTTP.

           type = yp
