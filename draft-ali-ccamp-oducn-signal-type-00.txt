     Abstract 

     RFCs 4328 and 7139 provide signaling extensions in Resource 
     ReserVation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) to control the 
     full set of Optical Transport Network (OTN) features.  However, 
     these specifications do not cover the additional Optical channel 
     Data Unit (ODU) containers defined in G.709/Y.1331 for ODUC1, 
     ODUC2, ODUC3, ODUC4, ODUC5, ODUC6, ODUC7, ODUC8 and ODUC9. This 
     document defines new Signal Types for these additional containers.  

     Conventions used in this document 

     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
     "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
     this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 
     [RFC2119].

     1. Introduction 

        [RFC7139] updates the portions of text related to the Optical 
        channel Data Unit (ODU) described in [RFC4328] to provide 
        extensions to Resource ReserVation Protocol - Traffic 
        Engineering (RSVP-TE) to support control for [G.709-v3] in the 
        OTN-TDM SENDER_TSPEC and OTN-TDM FLOWSPEC objects.  However, it 
        does not specify Signal Types for the beyond 100G ODUCn 
        containers defined in [G.709/Y.1331]. This document provides 
        RSVP-TE signaling extensions to support ODUC1, ODUC2, ODUC3, 
        ODUC4, ODUC5, ODUC6, ODUC7, ODUC8 and ODUC9 Signal Types.

     2. RSVP-TE extension for Beyond 100G Signal Types 

        [RFC7139] defines the format of Traffic Parameters in OTN-TDM 
        SENDER_TSPEC and OTN-TDM FLOWSPEC objects.  These traffic 
        parameters have a Signal Type field.  This document defines the 
        Signal Types for ODUC1, ODUC2, ODUC3, ODUC4, ODUC5, ODUC6, 
        ODUC7, ODUC8 and ODUC9, as defined in the IANA Considerations 
        section.  They are allocated via the Specification Required 
        policy added to the subregistry by [RFC7892].  

         
     3. Security Considerations 

        This document does not introduce any additional security issues 
        beyond those identified in [RFC7139].  

     4. IANA Considerations  

        IANA maintains the "Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching 
        (GMPLS) Signaling Parameters" registry that contains the "OTN 
        Signal Type" subregistry.  

     This document request IANA to add the following signal types in the 
     subregistry via the Specification Required policy [RFC5226]: 
      
      
           Value            Type 
           -----            ---- 
           TBA1             ODUC1  (100Gbps OTN [G.709/Y.1331]) 
           TBA2             ODUC2  (200Gbps OTN [G.709/Y.1331]) 
           TBA3             ODUC3  (300Gbps OTN [G.709/Y.1331]) 
           TBA4             ODUC4  (400Gbps OTN [G.709/Y.1331]) 
           TBA5             ODUC5  (500Gbps OTN [G.709/Y.1331]) 
           TBA6             ODUC6  (600Gbps OTN [G.709/Y.1331]) 
           TBA7             ODUC7  (700Gbps OTN [G.709/Y.1331]) 
           TBA8             ODUC8  (800Gbps OTN [G.709/Y.1331]) 
           TBA9             ODUC9  (900Gbps OTN [G.709/Y.1331]) 
      
     These Signal Types are carried in the Traffic Parameters in OTN-TDM 
     SENDER_TSPEC and OTN-TDM FLOWSPEC objects [RFC7139].
