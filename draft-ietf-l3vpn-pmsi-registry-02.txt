             IANA registry for PMSI Tunnel Type code points
                   draft-ietf-l3vpn-pmsi-registry-02

Abstract

   RFC 6514 created a space of Tunnel Type code points for a new BGP
   attribute called the "P-Multicast Service Interface Tunnel (PMSI
   Tunnel) attribute".  However the RFC did not create an IANA registry
   for these.

   There now is need to make further code point allocations from this
   name space.  This document serves to create an IANA registry for that
   purpose.

1.  Introduction

   In RFC 6514 BGP Encodings and Procedures for Multicast in MPLS/BGP IP
   VPNs' [RFC6514], an optional transitive BGP attribute called the
   "P-Multicast Service Interface Tunnel (PMSI Tunnel) attribute" is
   specified.  This BGP attribute uses an octet field to specify the
   PMSI tunnel type.  RFC 6514 allocates the values 0-7.

   There now is need to make further code point allocations from this
   name space.  In particular, draft-ietf-mpls-seamless-mcast
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-seamless-mcast] needs to make such an allocation.

   This document creates a new IANA registry called "P-Multicast Service
   Interface Tunnel (PMSI Tunnel) Tunnel Types" for these code points.
   The registry is created in in the "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
   Parameters" registry.

2.  Code points in RFC 6514

   RFC 6514 allocated the values 0 to 7 as foillows:

   + 0 - No tunnel information present
   + 1 - RSVP-TE P2MP LSP
   + 2 - mLDP P2MP LSP
   + 3 - PIM-SSM Tree
   + 4 - PIM-SM Tree
   + 5 - BIDIR-PIM Tree
   + 6 - Ingress Replication
   + 7 - mLDP MP2MP LSP

3.  Security Considerations

   This document simply creates an IANA registry from a table in RFC
   6514.  Thus, there are no secirity concerns.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to create a new registry called "P-Multicast
   Service Interface Tunnel (PMSI Tunnel) Tunnel Types" in the "Border
   Gateway Protocol (BGP) Parameters" registry.

   The allocation policy for values 0x00 to 0xFA is RFC Required.
   Values FB to FE are experimental and are not to be assigned. 0xFF is
   reserved.

   The initial registry should appear as:

         Value         Meaning                              Reference

         0x00          no tunnel information prersent       [RFC 6514]
         0x01          RSVP-TE P2MP LSP                     [RFC 6514]
         0x02          mLDP P2MP LSP                        [RFC 6514]
         0x03          PIM-SSM Tree                         [RFC 6514]
         0x04          PIM-SM Tree                          [RFC 6514]
         0x05          BIDIR-PIM Tree                       [RFC 6514]
         0x06          Ingress Replication                  [RFC 6514]
         0x07          mLDP MP2MP LSP                       [RFC 6514]
         0x08 - 0xFA   Unassigned
         0xFB - 0xFE   Experimental                         [This RFC]
         0xFF          Reserved                             [This RFC]
