Abstract

   Interoperation of Instant Messaging and Presence systems has been
   defined in IMPP Working Group. IMPP WG has come up with baseline
   interoperable operations and formats for Presence and Instant
   Messaging systems. However, these base formats might need
   standardized extensions in order to enable building rational
   applications using presence and instant messaging. This memo proposes
   an extension to PIDF presence document format to represent
   "Indicating User Agent Capabilities in the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP)" to be used in SIMPLE based presence systems but may
   also be applied to other protocols as well.

Internet-Draft    User agent capability presence extension  October 2003


1. Introduction

   Interoperation of instant messaging and presence systems has been
   defined in IMPP Working Group. Working Group has defined "A model for
   Presence and Instant Messaging" [2] and also requirements for
   protocols implementing such a system [3]. Common presence and Instant
   Messaging (CPP/CPIM) defines common operations and formats which all
   Presence and Instant Messaging services must agree upon so that basic
   interoperability would be possible [5], [6]. The actual base format
   for presence is being defined in [4]. The PIDF document format has
   been designed to reduce the need for gatewaying and to allow
   end-to-end security of presence data. It has taken very minimalistic
   approach to support such operations. In order to make the PIDF format
   usable by different presence applications, these applications usually
   must extend the basic PIDF format by standard XML mechanism as
   defined in [4].

   The aim of this memo is to introduce SIP/SIMPLE specific extension
   mechanism for the PIDF document. With this extension SIMPLE based
   applications can have richer and usable formats compared to the
   baseline PIDF data format. Aim of this document is to introduce
   extension for:

   o  "Indicating User Agent Capabilities in the Session Initiation
      Protocol (SIP)" [7]


1.1 Motivation

   The PIDF document format [4] defines a <contact> element which may
   appear once inside every <tuple> element. The content of the
   <contact>  element encodes the CONTACT ADDRESS and CONTACT MEANS as
   defined in [2]. The <contact> element is defined to be an URI.  This
   URI can be of any URI type.  In some implementations this URI can
   uniquely identify the application the tuple intends to describe (e.g.
   im: URIs). However, this may not be the case in all implementations.
   For example in SIP, a SIP URI can represent different kinds of
   applications. A SIP URI can be used to contact voice applications,
   video applications, or messaging applications. If it is not known by
   other means, it might be hard for applications processing the
   presence document containing only SIP URI contact addresses to know
   what particular application the tuple intends to describe. Also
   watchers receiving presence information would probably benefit for
   getting more descriptive information about what particular
   communication means or applications are supported by the presentity.

   "Indicating User Agent Capabilities in the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP)" document [7] defines a set of extensions which allow

Internet-Draft    User agent capability presence extension  October 2003


   callees to express preferences about request handling in SIP servers.
   The same information could provide value also to presence watchers so
   that they could make more rational decisions on how presentity should
   be contacted if presence document would contain similar information
   as defined in "Indicating User Agent Capabilities in the Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP)" extension. When "Indicating User Agent
   Capabilities in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)" extension is
   used in this context (to represent presence information) there is no
   need for automated processing compared to the case when the
   "Indicating User Agent Capabilities in the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP)" extension is used by proxies or registrars. Because
   of this, it should be sufficient to introduce "Indicating User Agent
   Capabilities in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)" extension
   representation for presence without specifying similar processing
   rules as defined in [7].

1.2 Scope

   This document defines extension to the PIDF document format which
   enables presence implementations based on SIP protocol to utilize
   similar capabilities in presence document as what "Indicating User
   Agent Capabilities in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)" document
   [7] defines.

   This extension does not replace media negotiation mechanisms defined
   for SIP (e.g.  SDP [14]), therefore media negotiation (e.g.  choose
   of voice and video codecs) MUST be performed according to [11]. This
   extension is only aimed to give the watchers hints about the
   presentity's preferences, willingness and capabilities to communicate
   before watchers would initiate SIP based communication with the
   presentity.

2. Conventions

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.

3. Extension for "Indicating User Agent Capabilities in the Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP)" in PIDF documents

   This section presents "Indicating User Agent Capabilities in the
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)" extension namespace, its elements,
   their values, and semantics. This section also describes how this
   extension can be further extended. This extension is intended to be
   used with application/cpim-pidf+xml content type and that particular
   usage is described here.  This extension may also be used with other

   content types if appropriate.

3.1 Extension overview

   This extension adds features presented in "Indicating User Agent
   Capabilities in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)" document [7]
   into PIDF presence document format. Extension also includes type
   feature tag [8] and language feature tag [9]. Features presented in
   [7], [8], and [9] are added here without any change in their
   semantics. Bringing these features to PIDF presence document format
   basically means mapping them to XML structure. Namespace identifier
   for this extension is:

   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:simple-prescaps-ext

   When this extension namespace is congregated with base PIDF document,
   combined document must follow the same general formatting rules as
   specified in [4] in chapter 4.1.

3.2 <prescaps> element

   Root element of this extension namespace is <prescaps>.  The root
   element MUST be always present. This element MAY contain one or more
   elements as specified later in this document.

   <prescaps> element does not have any attributes and it MAY contain
   other namespace declarations for the extensions used in the presence
   XML document.

3.3 <audio> element

   The <audio> element indicates that the device supports audio as a
   media type as defined in [7].

   The <audio> element is of boolean type and does not have any
   attributes. Value 'true' indicates that UA support audio media type
   and value 'false' indicates that UA does not support audio.

3.4 <application> element

   The <application> element indicates that the device supports
   application as a media type as defined in [7].

   The <application> element is of boolean type and does not have any

Internet-Draft    User agent capability presence extension  October 2003


3.15 <sip-extensions> element

   The <sip-extensions> element is a list of SIP extensions (each of
   which is defined by an option-tag registered with IANA) that are
   understood by the UA. Understood, in this context, means that the
   option tag would be included in a Supported header field in a request

   The <actor> element is of string type and does not have any
   attributes. Possible values include:

   o  principal: The device provides communication with the principal
      that is associated with the device. Often this will be a specific
      human being, but it can be an automata (for example, when calling
      a voice portal).

   o  attendant: The device provides communication with an automaton or
      person that will act as an intermediary in contacting the
      principal associated with the device, or a substitute.

Internet-Draft    User agent capability presence extension  October 2003


   o  msg-taker: The device provides communication with an automaton or
      person that will take messages and deliver them to the principal.

   o  information: The device provides communication with an automaton
      or person that will provide information about the principal.


3.19 <is-focus> element

   The <is-focus> element indicates that the UA is a conference server,
   also known as a focus, and will mix together the media for all calls
   to the same URI as defined in [7].

   The <is-focus> element is of boolean type and does not have any
   attributes.

3.20 <type> element

   The <type> element indicates indicates a MIME media content type
   (i.e. that appears in a 'Content-type:' header of the corresponding
   MIME-formatted data) as defined in [8].

   The <type> element is of string type and does not have any
   attributes. It must be a string of the form "type/subtype", where
   'type' and 'subtype' are defined by the MIME specification [17]. Only
   lower-case letters should be used.

3.21 <language> element

   The <language> element indicates Ability to display particular human
   languages as as defined in [9].

   The <language> element is of string type and does not have any
   attributes. Allowable values are defined by registration as defined
   in [18].

4. Generating 'prescaps' elements

   This section describes how "Indicating User Agent Capabilities in the
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)" extension elements should be
   generated.

   In [7] it is recommended that a UA provide complete information in
   its contact predicate. However, it may be that presentity is not
   willing to publish such presence information which would be
   consistent with actual device capabilities (e.g. presentity may not
   want to indicate that he/she supports voice when the device actually
   is able to support it). Also authorization rules or policies in



Lonnfors & Kiss          Expires April 23, 2004                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft    User agent capability presence extension  October 2003


   presence server may limit or modify published presence information in
   a way that all published presence information may not end up to all
   possible watchers.

   For reason discussed above is does not make sense to mandate that UA
   should publish complete information about its capabilities.

   Open Issue: "Indicating User Agent Capabilities in the Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP)" states that URI that represents an
   address-of-records should not be associated to any particular feature
   set (during registration). Is there any need to have same requirement
   in presence documents?

5. Generating SIP request based on 'prescaps' extension

   UA receiving PIDF documents with 'prescaps' extension may wish to
   generate SIP request which would route to UA having capabilities
   described by 'prescaps' extension. UA MAY add Accept-Contact: header
   based on 'prescaps' extension elements. Generating Require-Contact:
   based on 'prescaps' extension elements is NOT RECOMMENTED because of
   issues discussed in Section 4.

6. Using extension with PIDF document format

   This section presents guidelines how extension can be used with PIDF
   document format.

   PIDF format allows use of extension XML namespaces inside <presence>,
   <tuple>, and <status> elements. <presence> element is intended to
   describe presentity as a whole. 'Prescaps' extension is related to
   Contact Address defined by PIDF to which this extension is applied
   to. These Contact Addresses can only appear inside <tuple> elements.
   The use of this extension in <presence> element level is NOT
   RECOMMENDED for this purpose.

   'Prescaps' extension elements SHOULD be placed inside <status>
   element. Root element <prescaps> MUST NOT appear more than once
   inside a single <tuple> element but can appear multiple times in PIDF
   document format inside different <tuple> elements.

7. Examples

   This section presents examples how this extension can be used with
   base PIDF document format.

9. IANA Considerations

   This memo calls for IANA to register a new XML namespace URN as
   defined in [15]

9.1  URN sub-namespace registration for
    'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:simple-prescaps-ext'

   URI:
   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:simple-prescaps-ext

   to describe communication means extension for CPIM-PIDF presence
   document format in application/cpim-pidf+xml content type.

10. Security Considerations

   All security considerations specified in CPIM [5] and in PIDF [4]
   documents apply also to this document.  For clarity some of the
   security considerations are repeated here.

   Because presence is very privacy-sensitive information, the transport
   protocol for the presence information SHOULD have capabilities to
   protect protocol messages from possible threats, such as
   eavesdropping, corruption, tamper and replay attacks. The protocols
   SHOULD be able to use security mechanisms which are standardized or
   being standardized in IETF. However, it depends on the actual

   transport protocols which security mechanisms should be used, and it
   is beyond the scope of this memo.
