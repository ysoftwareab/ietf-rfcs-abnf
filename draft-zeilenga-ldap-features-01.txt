1. Overview

  LDAP [RFC2251] is an extensible protocol with numerous elective
  features.  LDAP provides mechanisms for a client to discover supported
  protocol versions, controls, extended operations, SASL mechanisms, and
  subschema information.  However, these mechanisms are not designed to
  support general feature discovery.

INTERNET-DRAFT           LDAP supportedFeatures             26 June 2001


  This document describes a simple, general-purpose mechanism which
  clients may use to discovery the set of features supported by a
  server.

  The key words ``MUST'', ``MUST NOT'', ``REQUIRED'', ``SHALL'', ``SHALL
  NOT'', ``SHOULD'', ``SHOULD NOT'', ``RECOMMENDED'',  and ``MAY'' in
  this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
  [RFC2119].


2. Discovery of supported features

  Each feature whose support may be discovered SHALL be identified by an
  Object Identifier (OID).  A server advertises its support for a given
  feature by providing the OID associated with the feature as a value of
  the supportedFeatures attribute held in the root DSE.  A client may
  examine the values of this attribute to determine if a particular
  feature is supported by the server.

  The supportedFeatures attribute type is described [RFC2252] as
  follows:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.3.5
        NAME 'supportedFeatures'
        DESC 'features supported by the server'
        EQUALITY objectIdentifierMatch
        SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.38
        USAGE dSAOperation )


3. Security Considerations

  As rogue clients can discover features of a server by other means
  (such as by trial and error), this feature discovery mechanism is not
  believed to introduce any new security risk to LDAP.


4. Acknowledgment

  This document is based upon input from the IETF LDAPext working group.
