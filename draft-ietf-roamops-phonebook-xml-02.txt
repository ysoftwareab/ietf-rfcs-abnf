2.  Abstract

   This document defines the syntax as well as the semantics of the
   information to be included in the phone book for roaming
   applications.  It comprises the information necessary to select the
   most appropriate ISP and to configure the host to get access to the
   network of the provider. The specification consists of a small set of
   required information elements and a variety of possible extensions.
   All data is specified in XML [5] (Extensible Markup Language) syntax
   leading to a concise XML DTD (Document Type Declaration) for the
   phone book.

3.  Introduction

   Roaming applications depend on the delivery of information about
   provided services and the procedures to get connected to the network
   from the roaming consortium to the individual users as well as from
   the operators of the network access servers, normally the members of
   the roaming consortium, and the roaming consortium.

    +------+

   The roaming consortium assembles from the individual contributions of
   the providers belonging to the consortium a unified version of the
   phone book for usage by the customers. Probably different groups of
   users get different versions of a phone book adapted to their
   particular needs. Even users might generate different subsets
   especially suited to particular applications from the information
   received from the roaming consortium, e.g. retrieving only entries
   for a particular country or extracting all access points providing
   wireless connectivity.

   Therefore it is desirable to define a highly portable and well formed
   structure of the phone book to enable easy generation and
   postprocessing. Goals of this document include:

      - Creating a flexible, extensible and robust framework
        upon which to build a standard phone book;
      - Promoting a standard phone book format, to enhance
        interoperability between ISPs and roaming consortia as
        well as to enable automatic extraction of configuration
        data by a wide variety of devices;
      - Defining a compact structure containing the essential
        information for the roaming user, to allow for storage
        and easy update even on small devices.

   It is not intended by this document to create a plethoric solution,
   with phone book elements to fit every condition on earth, neither to
   define any kind of phone book update or transfer protocol.


4.  Rationale for XML Usage

   XML is rapidly becoming a standard format for data exchange between
   different applications also taking into account the transfer and
   access of data over the web. XML is used as syntax for expressing the
   structure and content of a roaming phone book to enable widespread
   usage and access to many different kind of media (e.g. paper, CDROM,
   www) using a widespread selection of access devices. Furthermore XML
   enables:

      - Extensibility
      - Flexibility
      - Integration with directories

   Extensibility is important because phone books are living documents;
   as such, it is unlikely that all the semantic requirements of
   arbitrary Internet service providers (ISPs) would be met by a fixed
   scheme, no matter how well thought out.  Phone book designers must be
   free to create new attributes in a well-understood fashion to meet
   changing business needs.

   Flexibility is required of the attribute definition syntax for many
   of the same reasons that semantic extensibility is necessary. If we
   assume that phone book designers may need to define elements of
   arbitrary type, the syntax chosen must be able to represent these
   data objects cleanly. Using XML for describing the data content of
   the phone book fits this bill nicely, since it can be used to
   unambiguously describe virtually any data type.

   Integration with directories: although it is unlikely that phone
   books will be stored in the directory due to performance
   considerations, the creation of a XML DTD describing phone book
   content leaves that option open, with relatively little incremental
   effort required to implement it.


5.  Specification of Requirements

   In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST, "MUST NOT", "optional",
   "recommended", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT", are to be interpreted as
   described in [1].

6.  Value type notations for 'stronger' typing

   XML currently does not have capabilities for 'strong typing' of the
   content of elements. The only type definition foreseen in the base
   specification is "#PCDATA", 'parsable character data'. This might be
   sufficient and is used throughout this document to define elements
   containing information mainly aimed for interpretation by human
   beings.
   To enable a more concise description of the content of particular
   elements several value type notations are introduced. This allows for
   a more detailed type description of the content of elements in cases
   where it seems to be desirable.

7.  Container Element Definitions


7.1.  PhoneBook

   The phoneBook element is the basic container for phone book entries.
   It has two attributes, a phone book name and a phone book version
   number (applying to the phone book as a whole), and always contains
   one or more pop elements. A phoneBook element may also contain
   multiple Setup, Support and Provider elements, if they are referenced
   to by more than one pop element.

7.1.1.  phoneBook Attribute "name"

   The phoneBook attribute "name" is an arbitrary string assigned as an
   identifier for a phone book.

7.1.2.  phoneBook Attribute "version"

   The phoneBookVersion attribute is an integer representing the version
   of the phone book; it is a monotonically increasing counter which
   should be incremented each time the phone book is modified.
   This element can be used by a server to help decide what (if any)
   actions are required to bring a client's phone book up to date. For

   example, the client can, at connect time, send an update request to
   the server including in the request the version number of its current
   phone book. If the client's phone book version is not the same as the
   server's current phone book version, the server can easily take
   appropriate action, e.g., reply with a URL pointing to a file
   containing the differences between the client and server phone books.


7.2.  POP

   The pop element contains information elements relevant to individual
   network points of presence (POPs). The required information elements
   are addrFamily, address, media and entryVersion. The media element
   represents the media types supported by the POP, while the
   entryVersion element is a monotonically-increasing integer which
   should be incremented whenever the object is modified.

7.4.  Support

   The Support element includes those information elements that are
   pertinent to the provision of customer support for a POP or provider.
   Languages spoken by the staff at the support center might be
   specified by multiple entries for the attribute value language.

   The Provider element contains information elements pertaining to the
   general business operations of a given network service provider.  The
   information elements include such things as telephone number, mailing
   address, etc., as well as URLs for e-mail and a World Wide Web site.
   A Provider element may also contain a reference to support
   information.

8.  Information Element Definitions


8.1.  Information elements defined for the POP element


8.1.1.  pop Attribute "entryVersion"

   The entryVersion attribute is an integer representing the version of
   the POP object; it is a monotonically increasing counter which should
   be incremented each time the object is modified. This attribute may
   be useful in merging and updating phone books.


8.1.2.  Address

   The address element provides the information representing the address
   of the POP. For POPs offering dial-up network access, the address
   element will at least contain an IA5 string representing a telephone
   number, formatted in standard fashion [4] (e.g. "+ 1 234 5678"). More
   detailed information may be available by optional attribute values.

   Syntax:
      <!-- A network address for this POP -->
      <!ELEMENT address (#PCDATA)>


8.1.2.1.  address Attribute "family"

   The attribute family of the element address defines the address
   family to which the element value belongs.  For POPs offering dial-up
   network access, the addrFamily attribute will generally contain a
   value for a telephone network based address family. Currently the
   following attribute values are defined.  Additional values may be
   registered by IANA in future.

      Value   Description
      ------  --------------------------------------

      <!ATTRIBUTE address
              family (%addressFamily;) >


8.1.2.2.  address Attribute "encodingType"

   The encodingType attribute is a value representing the type of
   encoding used within a specific address family.  The value "0" is
   reserved and represents the native encoding.

   Syntax:
      <!-- The type of encoding used within this address family -->
      <!ATTRIBUTE address
              encodingType CDATA "0">


8.1.2.3.  address Attribute "countryCode"

   The countryCode attribute indicates the international dialing prefix
   for the country in which the POP is located.

   Syntax:
      <!-- ITU dialing code for the country in which this POP is located -->
      <!ATTRIBUTE address
              countryCode CDATA #IMPLIED >


8.1.2.4.  address Attribute "areaCode"

   The areaCode attribute contains the area or city code component of
   the telephone number in the 'address' element (if any) associated
   with this POP.

      <!-- Area or city code component of the telephone number in the
           accessTelephoneNumber element associated with this POP -->
      <!ATTRIBUTE address
              areaCode CDATA #IMPLIED >


8.1.3.  Media

   The media element is a container describing the types of media and
   related protocols supported by this POP. Protocols are specified for
   modem and ISDN.
   The following attribute values are currently defined. Additional
   values may be registered by IANA in future.

10.  Security Considerations

   In the current revision there are no security specific elements
   provided within the phone book XML DTD. Security has to be provided
   outside of the scope of the phone book.

   Security specific items, like a signature for authentication the
   content of the phone book, may be added in a later revision, if
   standards are available for generating digital signatures in XML.


11.  IANA Considerations

   The specification of the roaming phone book provides the possibility
   to define further attribute values for several information elements
   by extending the according parameter entity declaration.

   Separation of the entity declaration part of the phone book DTD,
   storing it as separate file on the Internet and referencing the URI
   of it by an external entity declaration in the beginning of the DTD
   specification allows to hand over the maintenance of the parameter
   declaration part of the roaming phone book to IANA.
