Abstract 
 
   This document defines a set of Session Description Protocol 
   (SDP)attributes that allow SDP to provides tightly controlled 
   membership information. Some multimedia conferencing applications may 
   require strict membership control policies. A group session creator 
   describes basic membership information in SDP, and it can be 
   negotiated by the Offer / Answer model.

1. Introduction 
 
   Session Description Protocol (SDP) [1] is designed to convey 
   multimedia conference relevant information to recipients. It provides 
   general description for all multimedia sessions. 
     
   However, it still does not provide specific membership information 
   which is necessary for some multicast sessions. Many scenarios can be 
   examples requiring membership information. In a conference, group 
   organizer may want to designate who should be mandatory participants 
   and how many number of participants are able to be handled when it 
   create a session. In a closed group where only specific member are 
   invited, a prospective group participant may want to know specific 
   group information as well as general information before session 
   joining, and may want to block a specific member. The initial 
   information described by group organizer can be negotiated with the 
   group joiners by Offer/Answer model [2]. 
    
   This draft is based upon a set of requirements to deliver tight 
   controlled membership information. It defines a set of new SDP 
   attributes that satisfy the requirements of tight membership control. 
     
    
    
2. Conventions used in this document 
 
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3] and 
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations. 
 
 
 
3. Terminology 
 
   closed model 
    
      only pre-determined, pre-announced, or end systems determined 
      during runtime can join a session. 
 
 
   static model 
 
      the group of participants does not change during runtime of the 
      session. 
 
 
   dynamic model

                   Tight Membership Support in SDP       October 2004 
 
      the group of participants might change during runtime of the 
      session. 
 
   loose model 
 
      a loose group is one for which it is not possible to determine 
      the group membership 
       
       
   tight model 
 
      a tight group can provide individual information of member, which 
      can be fully controlled. There may be two sub-categories by 
      participants' knowledge of the membership information: 
      completely-tight or partially tight model. 
       
 
   completely-tight model 
 
      every member may have knowledge of the individual name or email 
      address, or et al. 
       
 
   partially-tight model 
 
      a subset of members may have knowledge of the individual name or 
      address of every member (e.g. in a conference, a chairman and one 
      or more speakers can acquire the individual details).

4. New attributes for membership description in SDP 
 
   For tight controlled membership, SDP MUST have the optional 
   attributes to specify additional features: 
    
      - Group Characteristics: If the group is created as a static, 
         closed model or not. 
       
      - Membership Information: If there are mandatory members who 
         should be participated, group organizer may describe the list 
         of members. 
       
                                     
 
4.1 Attributes for group policy 
 
 
   * a=agipolicy:<policy> 
     a=agipolicy:<policy>/<condition> 
    
   A session owner can define this attribute when it creates a session. 
   Active Group Integrity(AGI) means a set of conditions concerning an 
   active group. <policy> filed holds "hard" or "soft". In "hard" policy, 
   the transport connection MUST be terminated when the AGI is violated. 
   In "soft" policy, it MUST be suspended when the AGI is violated and 
   it will be restored if the AGI is recovered. 
    
   <condition> defines "unity" or "quorum". "unity" specifies that all 
   of enrolled group members are required to be present in the active 
   group. "quorum" implies that the majority of group members are 
   required to be present.  
    
    
    
4.2 Attributes for Membership Information 
    
    
   * a=max:<maximum number> 
    
   This attributes specifies maximum number of participants that can be 
   allowed in an active group. The value of <maximum number> is 
   represented as a numeric number like "a=max:100". 
    
    
   * a=min:<minimum number> 
    
   This attributes specifies minimum number of participants that can be 
   allowed in an active group. The value of <minimum number> is 
   represented as a numeric number like "a=min:3".

                   Tight Membership Support in SDP       October 2004 
 
    
   * a=token:<token number> 
    
   This attribute specifies maximum number of participants that can be 
   allowed to concurrently transmit data. The value of <token number> is 
   represented as a numeric number like "a=token number:3". 
    
    
   * a=mandatory:permission <user id>/<URIs>/<others> 
    
   This attribute specifies the selected group members required to be 
   present or blocked in an active group. The value of permission is 
   "in" or "out", which represents the user is a mandatory participant 
   or a blocked participant. A series of "a=mandatory" can be specified 
   as following examples: 
    
   a=mandatory:in eunah/<sip:eunah@etri.re.kr>/ / 
   a=mandatory:out bob/<sip:bob@example.com>/ / 
    
    
   <user id> is the same with <username> in origin field of RFC2327. 
   <URIs> address the users contact information. <others> can be used to 
   specify additional information. 
    
   In order to identify mandatory users, a key should be exchanged, but 
   the detail methods of the key exchanges are of out the scope of this 
   document. 
    
    
5. Example of membership negotiation 
 
   Assume that the caller, Alice, has included the following description 
   in her offer. The offered SDP is: 
    
    
   v=0 
   o=alice 2890844526 2890844526 IN IP4 host.anywhere.com 
   s=Example of SDP extension for group information 
   c=IN IP4 host.anywhere.com 
   t=0 0 
   a=agipolicy:hard/quorum 
   a=min:3 
   a=token:2 
   a=mandatory:in bob/<sip:bob@example.com>/ / 
   a=mandatory:in eunah/Eunsook Kim <sip:eunah@etri.re.kr>/ / 
   m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 0 
   a=rtpmap:0 PCMU/8000 
   m=video 51372 RTP/AVP 31 
   a=rtpmap:31 H261/90000 
    
 
 
E.Kim                    Expires - April 2005                 [Page 6] 
                   Tight Membership Support in SDP       October 2004 
 
    
   The callee, Bob, want to create the group with "unity" condition, so 
   he returns the SDP below as the answer: 
    
    
   v=0 
   o=alice 2890844526 2890844526 IN IP4 host.anywhere.com 
   s=Example of SDP extension for group information 
   c=IN IP4 host.anywhere.com 
   t=0 0 
   a=agipolicy:hard/unity 
   a=min:3 
   a=token:2 
   a=mandatory:in bob/<sip:bob@example.com>/ / 
   a=mandatory:in eunah/Eunsook Kim <sip:eunah@etri.re.kr>/ / 
   m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 0 
   a=rtpmap:0 PCMU/8000 
   m=video 51372 RTP/AVP 31 
   a=rtpmap:31 H261/90000 
    
    
    
6. Security Considerations 
    
   Group membership policy and information is very sensitive information, 
   so that it MUST use appropriate authentication to ensure the data 
   originated from trusted parties. Other SDP considerations apply. The 
   further concerned security issues will be identified as the further 
   works go on.
