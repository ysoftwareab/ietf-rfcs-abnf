                Carrying Path Binding Information in BGP-4
                    draft-kao-path-binding-bgp4-00.txt

Abstract

   When BGP is used to distribute a route, it can also be used to 
   distribute a Link Layer PATH_NEXT_HOP binding which is mapped to that 
   route such that packets to that network route can be switched 
   directly across an Ethernet switched network. This document specifies 
   the way in which this is done.

1. Overview

   When BGP is used to distribute a route, it can also be used to 
   distribute a Link Layer PATH_NEXT_HOP binding that is mapped to that 
   route.  This document specifies the way in which this is done.  The 
   PATH_NEXT_HOP binding information for a particular network route is 
   piggybacked in the same BGP Update message that is used to distribute 
   the route itself.

   This can be useful in the following situation:

     - BGP speakers can peer with each other directly across a switched
       Ethernet network.
       
       Suppose in a IEEE 802.1ad PB (Provider Bridge) or IEEE 802.1ah 
       PBB (Provider Backbone Bridge) Ethernet switched network, edge 
       bridges E1 and E2 are BGP speakers interconnected via core 
       bridges C1 and C2. E2 advertises destination route D along with a 
       PATH_NEXT_HOP binding.
       
       If E1 needs to forward an IP packet to destination route D using
       E2 as BGP next-hop then E1 will simply put route D's PATH_NEXT_
       HOP binding in an Ethernet frame encapsulating the IP packet then 
       forwards that Ethernet frame towards E2 over a VLAN transport 
       path with Independent VLAN Learning (IVL) or IEEE 802.1ay PBB-TE
       capability, and thereby decoupling the actual path an IP packet 
       takes through a network from routing.  The PATH_NEXT_HOP binding 
       is essentially used as a link layer next-hop equivalence to the 
       network layer BGP Next Hop.

   In the case of a Route Reflector [BGP-RR], piggybacking the PATH_NEXT
   _HOP binding on the route distribution will also work with the added 
   benefit of better scalability. If the Route Reflector is not on the 
   forwarding path then it need not to be part of the switched Ethernet 
   network.
   
   PATH_NEXT_HOP distribution can be piggybacked in the BGP Update 
   message by using the BGP-4 Multiprotocol Extensions attribute 
   [RFC 2283].  The PATH_NEXT_HOP is encoded into the NLRI field of the 
   attribute, and the SAFI ("Subsequent Address Family Identifier") 
   field is used to indicate that the NLRI contains a PATH_NEXT_HOP.  A 
   BGP speaker may not use BGP to send PATH_NEXT_HOP to a particular BGP 
   peer unless that peer indicates, through BGP Capability Negotiation, 
   that it can process Update messages with the specified SAFI field.


2. Carrying PATH_NEXT_HOP Binding Information

   PATH_NEXT_HOP binding information is carried as part of the Network 
   Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) in the Multiprotocol Extensions 
   attributes.  The AFI indicates, as usual, the address family of the 
   associated route.  The fact that the NLRI contains a PATH_NEXT_HOP is
   indicated by using SAFI value 127 [assignment to be confirmed by 
   IANA].

   The Network Layer Reachability information is encoded as one or more
   tuples of the form <length, PATH_NEXT_HOP, prefix>, 
   whose fields are described below:

      +----------------------------+
      |   Length (1 octet)         |
      +----------------------------+
      |   PATH_NEXT_HOP (6 octets) |
      +----------------------------+
      |   Prefix (variable)        |
      +----------------------------+

   The use and the meaning of these fields are as follows:

      a) Length:

         The Length field indicates the length in bits of the address
         prefix plus the PATH_NEXT_HOP.

      b) PATH_NEXT_HOP:

         The Path_Next_Hop MAC address field carries one Ethernet 
         path next-hop MAC address. Each MAC address is encoded as 
         48-bit IEEE 802 MAC address.

      c) Prefix:

         The Prefix field contains address prefixes followed by enough
         trailing bits to make the end of the field fall on an octet
         boundary.  Note that the value of trailing bits is irrelevant.

   As opposed to the Network Layer BGP Next Hop, the PATH_NEXT_HOP is 
   used to identify a Link Layer Next Hop for the routes distributed in 
   a NLRI.  One of the usage of PATH_NEXT_HOP is in BGP/PB IP VPN [BGP-
   PB-VPN] and BGP/PBB IP VPN [BGP-PBB-VPN].


3. Advertising Multiple Routes to a Destination

   A BGP speaker may maintain (and advertise to its peers) more than one
   route to a given destination, as long as each such route has its own
   PATH_NEXT_HOP.

   The encoding described above allows a single BGP Update message to
   carry multiple routes, each with its own PATH_NEXT_HOP.

   In the case where a BGP speaker advertises multiple routes to a
   destination, if a route is withdrawn, only the corresponding route 
   with the corresponding PATH_NEXT_HOP is withdrawn. If a route is 
   withdrawn, and no PATH_NEXT_HOP is specified at the time of 
   withdrawal, then only the corresponding non-PATH_NEXT_HOP route is 
   withdrawn; the PATH_NEXT_HOP routes are left in place.


4. Capability Negotiation

   A BGP speaker that uses Multiprotocol Extensions to carry PATH_NEXT_
   HOP binding information should use the Capabilities Optional 
   Parameter, as defined in [BGP-CAP], to inform its peers about this 
   capability.  The MP_EXT Capability Code, as defined in [BGP-MP], is 
   used to negotiate the (AFI, SAFI) pairs available on a particular 
   connection.

   A BGP speaker should not advertise this capability to another BGP
   speaker unless there is a Ethernet switched connectivity between the 
   two speakers.

   A BGP speaker that is capable of handling multiple routes to a
   destination (as described above) should use the Capabilities Optional
   Parameter, as defined in [BGP-CAP], to inform its peers about this
   capability. The value of this capability is TBD.
