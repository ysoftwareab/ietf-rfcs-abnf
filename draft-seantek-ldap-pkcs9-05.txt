Internet-Draft         LDAP PKCS #9 Registrations          June 24, 2016


1.  Introduction

   This document registers the LDAP [RFC4510] schema definitions
   [RFC4512] for a subset of elements specified in PKCS #9 [PKCS9],
   including attribute types; matching rules and syntaxes to be used
   with these attribute types; and related object classes.

   As the elements and their semantics are defined in [PKCS9], this
   document needs to be read in conjunction with [PKCS9] to make use of
   the LDAP registrations provided herein. [PKCS9] provides complete
   definitions, with one significant omission: the IANA Considerations
   section was never appended. This document provides the IANA
   Considerations section necessary to register appropriate descriptors.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP14].

2.  Syntaxes

   Appendix B.1 of [PKCS9] describes various syntaxes used in LDAP to
   transfer PKCS #9 elements and related data types.

3.  Matching Rules

   Appendix B.4 of [PKCS9] provides matching rules for use in LDAP.

4.  Attribute Types

   Appendix B.3 of [PKCS9] details attribute types for use in LDAP,
   including (by its own admission) attributes that are highly unlikely
   to be stored in a Directory. The attributes in Appendix B.3 that are
   not highly unlikely to be stored in a Directory are registered via
   this document.

   [PKCS9] includes certain attribute types that have found meaningful
   use outside of the PKCS series. Specifically:

      o  emailAddress is mandated in [RFC5750], and has mandatory
         processing requirements if included in a certificate [RFC5280].
      o  [RFC5280] recommends the recognition of pseudonym.
      o  The Qualified Certificates Profile [RFC3739] requires both
         pseudonym and the vital records dateOfBirth, placeOfBirth,
         gender, countryOfCitizenship, and countryOfResidence.
      o  "DESC" is sometimes emitted for the description (2.5.4.13)
         attribute.

   As a result, certain applications not only encounter and generate

Internet-Draft         LDAP PKCS #9 Registrations          June 24, 2016


   these attributes in practice, but also use short descriptors that
   have come to be widely recognized.

4.1.  Semantics of dateOfBirth Clarified

   [PKCS9] Section 5.2.4 states that dateOfBirth "is the date of birth
   for the subject it is associated with." Its GeneralizedTime syntax,
   however, requires time and time zone specifications that are not
   related to dateOfBirth's semantics.

   [RFC3739] RECOMMENDS that the time recorded be GMT (i.e., UTC) noon
   down to the granularity of seconds "in order to prevent accidental
   change of date due to time zone adjustments." Since contemporary time
   zones range from -1200 to +1400, however, naive processing will
   misinterpret this value by one day for timezones significantly ahead
   of UTC.

   Since all specifications are under the change control of the IETF,
   the semantics of dateOfBirth are hereby defined: in dateOfBirth, only
   the date is meaningful. Parsers that need to convert the
   GeneralizedTime value to a specific point in time MUST decode the
   date in the UTC timezone to avoid shifting of the date due to
   timezone differences (such as in +14). Thus, a subject born in
   GMT+1400 will have a GeneralizedTime value that is essentially one
   day ahead (2am), when interpreted literally.

   When stored in LDAP, a conformant implementation MAY record this
   value in UTC or in local time, but MUST NOT record this value with a
   timezone offset. I.e., [X.680] subclauses 46.2 a) and b) and 46.3 a)
   and b) are acceptable; subclauses 46.2 c) and 46.3 c) are not
   acceptable. [[TODO: get consensus on this.]] When comparing such
   values, "local time" values SHALL be compared as if the local time is
   UTC.

   The following sentence of [RFC3739] Section 3.2.2 remains in effect
   for both certificate and non-certificate uses: "Compliant
   [certificate] [sic] parsing applications SHOULD ignore any time data
   and just present the contained date without any time zone
   adjustments."

4.2.  Short Descriptors for Certain Useful Attribute Types

   As permitted by Section 3.4 of [RFC4520], the short descriptors in
   Table 1 are registered along with their more verbose counterparts
   reflected in [PKCS9]:

4.3.  Short Descriptors for Certain Other Attribute Types

   As permitted by Section 3.4 of [RFC4520], the short descriptors in
   Table 2 are registered along with their more verbose counterparts
   elsewhere:

               desc                 description

         Table 2: Short Descriptors for Certain Attribute Types

6.  PKCS Attribute Types

   Security-related applications make use of the Object Identifier
   Descriptors registry, but these registrations are not likely to be
   used directly by Directory (LDAP) applications. It is apparent that
   the descriptors for these applications occupy the same broad
   namespace, although LDAP-related technologies (including
   distinguished names, which are used outside of LDAP) have very little
   use for descriptors used by security applications, and vice-versa.

   This section modifies the LDAP Descriptor Registration Template
   (Appendix A.4 of [RFC4520]) to permit an additional Usage: PKCS
   attribute type. LDAP implementations do not need to recognize these
   types. Conversely, PKCS (including PKIX and CMS) applications do not
   need to recognize non-PKCS attribute types when the context calls for
   PKCS attribute types (e.g., in CMS [RFC5652] and private key
   [RFC5958] attributes).

   Generally, the proper way to store PKCS attributes in a directory is
   to include the attributes within a corresponding PKCS object, and
   then to store the PKCS object (e.g., PKCS #12 object [RFC7292]) in
   the appropriate attribute in the pkcsEntity auxiliary object class
   (Section 4.1 of [PKCS9]).

Internet-Draft         LDAP PKCS #9 Registrations          June 24, 2016


   The remaining attributes in [PKCS9] are registered as PKCS attribute
   types in this document.

5.  Object Classes

   Appendix B.2 of [PKCS9] details a set of object classes for use in
   LDAP.

6.  Security Considerations

   PKCS #9 security considerations (written for the RFC edition) [PKCS9]
   apply to the definitions in this document. LDAP security and privacy
   considerations in [RFC4510] and [RFC4512] apply as well.

   Some attributes such as dateOfBirth and placeOfBirth may be subject
   to privacy laws in certain jurisdictions. If conveyed with LDAP,
   these attributes ought to be returned over a protected channel, such
   as TLS.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA shall register an LDAP Object Identifier [RFC4520] for use
   in this technical specification. The IANA shall update the Note in
   the LDAP Descriptor registry [RFC4520] to include the new usage PKCS
   Attribute Type, with symbol P. The IANA shall update the LDAP
   Descriptor registry [RFC4520] with definitions from [PKCS9] as
   indicated below.
