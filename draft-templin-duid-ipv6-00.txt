      The IPv6 Address-based DHCPv6 Unique Identifier (DUID-IPv6)
                       draft-templin-duid-ipv6-00

Abstract

   This document defines a new DHCPv6 Unique Identifier (DUID) type
   called DUID-IPv6 that contains a single 128 bit IPv6 address.  DUID-
   IPv6 makes it possible for devices to use suitably-derived unique
   IPv6 addresses to identify themselves to DHCPv6 servers and/or other
   network nodes.

1.  Introduction

   DHCP Unique Identifiers (DUIDs) are used in DHCPv6 control messages
   [RFC8415] to identify clients and servers (they may also be used in
   other protocol messages that import the format).  This document
   defines a new DUID type containing a single IPv6 address [RFC8200]
   that has been suitably derived through some means to ensure
   uniqueness.  The new DUID type is termed DUID-IPv6.

   Some methods of producing unique identifiers take care to ensure that
   the identifier includes a well-formed IPv6 address.  For example, the
   Host Identity Tag (HIT) [RFC7401][I-D.ietf-drip-rid] is a valid IPv6
   address and therefore occupies the same 128-bit space as for any IPv6
   address (in network byte order).  The only distinction needed within
   the DUID space is therefore a new DUID type value indicating the
   presence of a single IPv6 address.

   DUID-IPv6 makes it possible for devices to use suitably-derived IPv6
   addresses to identify themselves to DHCPv6 servers and vice versa.
   The DUID-IPv6 format makes no statement about the method used for
   generating the IPv6 address, but its use in control messages asserts
   that the address has been ensured unique through some unspecified
   means.  The following sections present the DUID-IPv6 format and type
   designation.

3.  Background

   In DHCPv6, clients identify themselves to servers via DHCP Unique
   Identifiers (DUIDs) [RFC8415].  DUIDs are identifiers that DHCP
   servers treat as opaque objects with no internal structure.  DUIDs
   are intended to be globally unique, with no two devices using the
   same DUID.

   Four DUIDs types have been defined previously:

   DUID-LLT  the Link-Layer address of one of the device's network
      interfaces, concatenated with a timestamp.

   DUID-EN  an Enterprise Number plus additional information specific to
      the enterprise.

   DUID-LL  the Link-Layer address of one of the device's network
      interfaces.

   DUID-UUID  used in situations where there is a Universally Unique
      IDentifier (UUID) stored in a device's firmware settings
      [RFC6355].

   This document specifies a fifth DUID type, known as DUID-IPv6 and
   identified by DUID-Type value TBD which distinguishes it from all
   other types.

4.  DUID-IPv6 Format

   The DUID-IPv6 is carried within control messages.  It has the
   following format:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |         DUID-Type (TBD)       |    IPv6 Address (128 bits)    |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                               |
      |                                                               |
      |                                                               |
      |                                -+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                                |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

5.  DUID-IPv6 Uses

   The DUID-IPv6 may appear in DHCPv6 and/or other protocol control
   messages within a service domain when a unique ID based on an IPv6
   address is required.

6.  Relation to Other DUID Types

   DUID-IPv6 differs in size, format and contents from DUID-LLT, DUID-EN
   and DUID-LL.  DUID-IPv6 shares the same size and format as DUID-UUID,
   however DUID-UUID includes a UUID which is by definition not an IPv6
   address.  (A case could be considered for allowing the existing DUID-
   UUID format to also include an IPv6 address (i.e., instead of a
   UUID), however this would require a domain-wide observation of the
   alternate use.)

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a value TBD in the 'dhcpv6-parameters'
   registry for DUID-IPv6.

8.  Security Considerations

   DHCP traffic between a client and server is sent in the clear.  An
   eavesdropper residing on the path between the client and server could
   see DHCP traffic and obtain the unique IPv6 address asserted by a
   particular machine.  This may raise some privacy issues but is not a
   new issue brought on by the use of the DUID type defined in this
   document.
