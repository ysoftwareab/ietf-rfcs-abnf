Abstract

   The popularity of wireless local area networks (WLANs) has led to
   wide spread deployments across different establishments.  It has also
   translated in to increasing scale of the WLANs.  Large-scale
   deployments made of large numbers of wireless termination points
   (WTPs) and covering substantial areas are increasingly common.

3.  Introduction

   The popularity of wireless local area networks (WLANs) has led to
   numerous but incompatible designs and solutions.  The CAPWAP
   Architecture Taxonomy [I-D.ietf-capwap-arch] describes major
   variations of these designs.  Among them, the local-MAC and split-MAC
   architecture designs are notable categories.

   Wireless LAN Control Protocol (WiCoP) recognizes the major
   architecture designs and presents a common platform on which WLAN
   entities of different designs can be accommodated.  This enables
   interoperability among wireless termination points (WTPs) and WLAN
   access controllers (ACs) of distinct architecture designs.  WiCoP
   therefore allows for cost-effective WLAN expansions.  It can also
   accommodate future developments in WLAN technologies.  Figure 1
   illustrates the WiCoP opertional structure in which distinct control
   elements are utilized for local-MAC and split-MAC WTPs.

   WiCoP also addresses the increasing trend of shared infrastructure
   WLANs.  Here, WLAN management needs to distinguish and isolate
   control for the different logical groups sharing a single physical
   WLAN.  WiCoP manages WLANs through a series of tunnels that separate
   traffic based on logical groups.

   The WiCoP operational structure in Figure 1 shows that each WTP uses
   a number of tunnels to distinguish and separate traffic for control
   and for each logical group.  The protocol allows for managing WLANs
   in a manner consistent with the logical groups that share the
   physical infrastructure.

                                 Figure 1

   From Figure Figure 1 WiCoP establishes and operates control tunnels
   and logical group tunnels between the AC and two types of WTPs.  The
   control tunnels are used to transport WiCoP messages dealing with the
   configuration, monitoring and management of WTPs as a physical whole.
   The logical group tunnels serve to separate traffic among each of the
   logical groups constituting a physical WTP.

   The Initialization state represents the initial states of WTPs and
   AC.  A WTP or AC in this state powers on, clears internal registers,
   runs hardware self-tests and resets network interfaces.

   The Capabilities Exchange state represents initial protocol exchange
   between a WTP and an AC.  A WTP in this state determines possible ACs
   from which it can receive management services.  An AC in this state
   determines the capabilities of the WTP and the WTP's compatibility
   with the management services it offers.

   The Connection state represents the creation of a security
   infrastructure between WTP and AC.  This involves mutual
   authentication and the establishment of a secure connection between
   the WiCoP entities.

   The Configuration state represents the exchange of long-term
   operational parameters and settings between a WTP and AC.  A WTP in
   this state receives configuration information to allow it to operate
   consistently within the WLAN managed by the AC.  An AC in this state
   provides configuration information to the WTP based on the WTP's
   capabilities and network policies.

   The Operation state represents the active exchange of WiCoP
   monitoring and management messages.  WTPs send regular status updates
   to and receive corresponding management instructions from the AC.
   This state also involves firmware and configuration updates arising
   from changes in network conditions and administrative policies.

5.  WiCoP Format

   WiCoP uses separate packets for control and data message transfer
   between the AC and WTPs.  A common header is used for both types of
   packets in which a single-bit flag distinguishes between them.  This
   section presents the packet formats for WiCoP packets.

   Version Field

   This field indicates the protocol version.


   'M' Field

   The MAC-type field, 'M', distinguishes between local-MAC WTPs and
   split-MAC WTPs.  It is used to efficiently realize interoperability
   between WTPs of the two different designs.  A '0' value indicates
   WiCoP exchanges with a split-MAC WTP while a '1' value indicates
   WiCoP exchanges with a local-MAC WTP.

   The presence of this classification bit in the WiCoP common header
   serves to expedite processing of WiCoP and WLAN traffic at the AC.
   So with a single parsing of the WiCoP common header once, the AC will
   be able to determine the appropriate processing required for the
   particular WiCoP packet.

   The differentiator field, 'D', is used to distinguish between WTP
   variants within a type of WTP design.  The CAPWAP Architecture
   Taxonomy [I-D.ietf-capwap-arch] illustrates that the split-MAC design
   allows encryption/decryption to be performed at either the WTP or the
   AC.  The Architecture Taxonomy also indicates that the local-MAC
   design allows authentication to take place at either the WTP or the
   AC.

   WiCoP acknowledges these major variants and accommodates them using
   the 'D' field in conjunction with the 'M' field.  So for a split-MAC
   WTP, the 'D' field is used to indicate location of encryption/
   decryption while for a local-MAC WTP, the 'D' field is used to
   indicate location of authentication.  The following table highlights
   their usage.

   'M'             'D'             Description

    0               0              Split-MAC WTP - Encryption/decryption
                                   is performed at WTP
    0               1              Split-MAC WTP - Encryption/decryption
                                   is performed at AC
    1               0              Local-MAC WTP - Authentication is
                                   performed by WTP
    1               1              Local-MAC WTP - Authentication is
                                   performed by AC

   Similar to the 'M' field, the presence of this classification in the
   WiCoP common header helps expedite processing at the AC with a single
   parsing.  By incorporating the classification bits in the WiCoP
   common header, where it is available for all packets of a session,
   the AC processing can be expedited.  Alternatively, the AC would have
   to check each arriving packet against an internal register and
   consequently delay processing.


   'C' Field

   This field distinguishes between a WiCoP control and WiCoP data
   packet.  Each type of information is tunneled separately across the
   WiCoP tunnel interfaces between WTPs and the AC.  A '0' value for the
   'C' field indicates a data packet while a '1' value indicates a
   control packet.

   The 'C' field is also used to assign WiCoP packets to distinct data
   and control tunnels between AC and WTP.  WiCoP also maintains logical
   groups in WLANs with the 'C field.

   'R' Field

   The retransmission field, 'R', is used to differentiate between first
   and subsequent transmission of WiCoP packets.  The 'R' field is used
   for critical WiCoP packets such as those relating to security key
   exchanges.  A '0' value for the 'R' field indicates the first
   transmission of a WiCoP packet while a '1' value indicates a
   retransmission.


   'E' Field

   The encryption field, 'E', is used to indicate if the WiCoP packet is
   encrypted between the AC and WTPs.  The 'E' field is used for those
   WiCoP packets that are exchanged during initialization.  A '0' value
   indicates the WiCoP packet is unencrypted while a '1' value indicates
   the packet is encrypted.


   'F' Field

   The fragmentation field indicates if the packet is a fragment of a
   larger packet.  A '0' value indicates a non-fragmented packet while a
   '1' value indicates a fragmented packet.  The 'F', 'L', 'Fragment ID'
   and 'Fragment No.' fields are used together.


   'L' Field

   This field is used to indicate the last fragment of a larger packet.
   It is only valid when the 'F' field has a '1' value.  A '0' value for
   the 'L' field indicates the last fragment of a larger packet while a
   '1' value indicates an intermediate fragment of a larger packet.  The
   'F', 'L', 'Fragment ID' and 'Fragment No.' fields are used together.


   Fragment ID Field

   The Fragment ID identifies the larger packet which has been
   fragmented.  It is used to distinguish between fragments of different
   large packets.  This field is valid only when the 'F' field has a '1'
   value.  The 'F', 'L', 'Fragment ID' and 'Fragment No.' fields are
   used together.


   Fragment No.  Field

   The fragment number field identifies the sequence of fragments of a

   larger packet.  The value of the Fragment No. field is incremented
   for each fragment of a larger packet so as to show the order of
   fragments.  This field is valid only when the 'F' field has a '1'
   value.  The 'F', 'L', 'Fragment ID' and 'Fragment No.' fields are
   used together.


   Length Field

   This field specifies the length of the WiCoP payload following the
   header.

5.2  WiCoP Control Packet

   The WiCoP control header follows the WiCoP common header.  It is
   highlighted in Figure 5.

   The control packet adds four additional fields to the common header.
   These are described below;

   Msg Type Field

   The message type field specifies the type of control message
   transported in the packet.  The list of control messages is presented
   below.


   Seq Num Field

   The sequence number field is used to map WiCoP request and response
   sequences.  The initiator of a WiCoP request message increments the
   Seq Num field for each new request message.  The responder then uses
   these values of the Seq Num fields in its corresponding response
   messages.

   Conf-If-Data

   The Conf-If-Data message element relates to the wireless interface.
   So a WTP with many interfaces will include corresponding numbers of
   Conf-If-Data message elements within its control messages to the AC.
   Conf-If-Data message elements are indexed by the If ID information
   item.

   Conf-WTP-Data

   Configuration information is provided on the basis of logical groups
   such as virtual APs.  So there are multiple Conf-WTP-Data message
   elements to address the many logical groups within a WLAN managed by
   WiCoP.  Conf-WTP-Data message elements are indexed by the BSSID
   information item.

   Terminal-Data:

   The Terminal-Data message element is applicable for both local-MAC
   and split-MAC WTP designs.  In the case of local-MAC, Terminal-Data
   is sent from WTPs to the AC.  In the case of split-MAC, Terminal-Data
   is sent from the AC to WTPs.  So the direction of usage depends on
   the type of WTP at which wireless terminal operations are performed.
   Some information items may be optional for use with specific WTP
   designs.

   Description: WTPs send Capabilities message upon transitioning from
   the Initialization state to Capabilities Exchange state.  The message
   serves to discover and identify the controlling AC of the WLAN and to
   provide it with identification and capabilities information.  In the
   IEEE 802.11 use-case, the Capabilities message also specifies the
   WTP's IEEE 802.11e and IEEE 802.11i features.

5.3  WiCoP Data Packet

   WiCoP data packets include the WiCoP common header followed by a
   payload.  Data packets are used to distinguish traffic from control
   when both control and data paths are identical.  Such a scenario
   would involve data traffic of the WTPs traversing the AC.  However,
   given the diversity of large-scale WLAN deployments, there are
   scenarios in which data and control paths are distinct.  WiCoP can be
   used in both cases.

   The WiCoP data packet format is illustrated below in Figure 7
   together with the WiCoP common header.

5.4  WiCoP Timers

   WiCoP uses a number of timers to determine WLAN status and maintain
   system performance.  Timers are maintained by all WiCoP entities.

5.4.1  Active Presence Timer

   The Active Presence Timer is used by each WiCoP entity - AC and WTPs
   - to verify the presence of each other.  The absence of a reply to
   the Feedback message within the expiration of the Active Presence
   Timer indicates the corresponding entity is inactive.  Contingency
   operations such as reset are used in this case.  The value of the
   Active Presence Timer ranges from 10 to 300 seconds with a default
   value of 30 seconds.

5.4.2  Feedback Interval

   Feedback messages are periodic with the frequency defined by the
   Feedback Interval.  The interval is set during WTP configuration.  It
   has a value ranging from 1 to 100 seconds and a default value of 10
   seconds.

   The Feedback Interval timer sets the periodicity of WLAN system
   audits.  So with this timer, the WLAN controller receives regular
   information on the state of the WLAN and all its WTPs.

5.4.3  Response Timer

   This is a general purpose timer used to limit the elapsed time
   between transmission of a request message and receipt of a
   corresponding response message.  The value of this timer ranges from

   1 to 3 seconds with a default value of 1 second.

5.4.4  Wireless Connectivity Timer

   This timer triggers any changes in wireless connectivity.  WiCoP uses
   this timer to send Notification and other messages relating to
   wireless conditions.  It is also used to trigger the disconnection of
   mobile terminals without disassociation.  The value of the Wireless
   Connectivity Timer ranges from 1 minute to 86,400 minutes with a
   default value of 10 minutes.

6.  WiCoP Processes

   The processes of the Wireless LAN Control Protocol are described in
   this section with respect to the operational state in which they
   occur.

6.1  Initialization

   The Initialization state represents the initial conditions of WiCoP
   entities.  WTPs and ACs in this state are powered on, run hardware
   self-check tests and reset network interfaces.

   State transition: Initialization -> Capabilities Exchange
        WTP: Automatically upon detecting an active network interface
        AC: Upon receiving a Capabilities message from a WTP

6.2  Capabilities Exchange

   The Capabilities Exchange state allows WTPs to first find an AC and
   then to exchange capabilities information with it.

   WiCoP is designed to control WLANs with both local-MAC and split-MAC
   WTPs.  The differences in their respective functional characteristics
   are determined in this state.

   The WTP first broadcasts a Capabilities message as soon as it
   transitions from its Initialization state.  The Capabilities message
   serves to discover ACs and contains information on its identity and
   capabilities.

   The AC receiving the Capabilities message transitions from its
   Initialization state.  It examines compatibility with respect to the
   WTP type, its capabilities and responds with an appropriate
   Capabilities Response message.

   The WTP continues to send Capabilities messages at an interval
   specified by the Response Timer until it receives a Capabilities
   Response message from an AC.

   The AC maintains a count of Capabilities messages received from a
   given WTP, which it uses to ignore WTPs after a limit.  This is to
   ensure that rogue WTPs which are not compatible with the AC do not
   repeatedly attempt connections.  The limit of connection attempts is
   3 within 60 seconds.

   State transition: Capabilities Exchange -> Connection
        WTP: Upon receiving a positive Capabilities Response message
        from an AC

        AC: Upon receiving a Connection Request message from a WTP

6.3  Connection

   The Connection state involves establishing a security infrastructure
   between WTPs and an AC.

   The WTP sends a Connection message to trigger the authentication and
   security mechanism.  So this message initiates an IPSec security
   association.

   The AC sends a positive Connection Response message after
   establishment of the security association or a negative Connection
   Response message if an error occurs.  The AC also monitors the
   receipt of WiCoP control messages to prevent replay attacks.

   The security association between AC and WTPs covers mutual
   authentication and also protection for integrity, confidentiality and
   modification protection for subsequent traffic exchanges.

   In order to avoid forceful disconnections of legitimate WTPs after a
   successful Connection, the AC ignores Capabilities messages received
   with a previously registered WTP identification.

   State transition: Connection -> Configuration
        WTP: Upon successful establishment of security infrastructure
        marked by  sending of a Configuration Request message
        AC: Upon receiving Configuration Request message from WTP after
        successful establishment of security infrastructure

   State transition: Connection -> Capabilities Exchange
        WTP: Upon expiry of WTP Response Timer before receipt of
        positive Connection Response message from AC or upon receipt of
        negative Connection Response message
        AC: Upon expiry of AC Response Timer before receipt of
        Configuration Request message from WTP

6.4  Configuration

   The Configuration state in one in which relatively long-term
   operational parameters such as those for identification and logical
   groups, are exchanged.  These parameters are based on previously
   exchanged capabilities information and network policies.

   The WTP sends a Configuration Request message to the AC.

   The AC first acknowledges the WTP's Configuration Request, after
   which it sends appropriate configuration information in subsequent

   Configuration Data messages.  WiCoP includes MIB objectives as
   message elements in some Configuration Data messages so as to
   simplify WTP configuration.

   The WTP acknowledges Configuration Data messages individually or en
   bloc with Configuration Data Response messages.  The Response timer
   is maintained at both WTP and AC to track the exchanges.

   The AC also establishes relevant processing schedules according to
   the WTP's architecture design.  For example, for split-MAC WTPs, the
   AC arranges its processing schedule to parse IEEE 802.11 control and
   management messages while for local-MAC WTPs, the AC arranges
   schedules processing so as to bypass parsing of IEEE 802.11
   management messages.

   The AC sends a Configure Trigger message after sending all relevant
   configuration information to the WTP.

   The WTP acknowledges a Configure Trigger message with a Configure
   Trigger Response message before activating the previously exchanged
   configuration parameters.

   In order to avoid forceful disconnections of legitimate WTPs after
   successful Configuration, the AC ignores Capabilities messages
   received with a previously registered WTP identification.

   State transition: Configuration -> Operation
        WTP: After receiving final Configuration Data message from AC
        marked by receipt of a Configure Trigger message from the AC
        AC: Upon receiving acknowledgement for Configure Trigger message
        marked by receipt of Configure Trigger Response message from WTP

   State transition: Configuration -> Capabilities Exchange
        WTP: Upon expiry of WTP Response Timer before receipt of
        Configure Trigger message from AC
        AC: Upon expiry of AC Response Timer before receipt of Configure
        Data Response message or Configure Trigger Response message

   The following describe major configuration aspects of WiCoP.

6.4.1  Logical Groups

   Configuration Data messages are used to establish logical groups in
   the WLAN and also to separate traffic among them.  The logical groups
   are established based on network administrative policies and other
   external considerations.  In the IEEE 802.11 use-case, logical groups
   are established with BSSID-based virtual APs and are separated over
   the WiCoP interface using tunnels.



Iino, et al.            Expires December 25, 2005              [Page 41]
 
Internet-Draft                    WiCoP                        June 2005


   The AC assigns particular BSSIDs of the WTP to specific VLAN tunnels.
   This assignment is specified to the WTP using the BSSID-TunnelID
   parameter in the Configuration Data message.  The logical group
   mapping therefore works across the wireless and WiCoP interfaces.

   The WTP then identifies the specified BSSID and VLAN tunnel as
   corresponding to one logical group.  It creates internal state such
   that traffic belonging to the logical group is kept distinct from
   that of other logical groups.

   The AC and WTP also use distinct VLAN tunnels for data and control
   traffic.  The 'C' field in the WiCoP header is used to distinguish
   and assign WiCoP packets to particular data and control VLAN tunnels.

6.4.2  Resource Control

   The AC sends QoS information using QoS-Value message elements in
   Configuration Data messages.  The QoS-Value message element contains
   values for EDCA and HCCA parameters.  This information is specified
   for each of the logical groups.  In the IEEE 802.11 use-case, QoS-
   Value message elements are specified for each BSSID.

   The WTP configures QoS parameters locally and also forwards relevant
   settings to wireless terminals in appropriate encapsulations.  In the
   IEEE 802.11 use-case, QoS parameters are sent to wireless terminals
   in corresponding Beacon or Probe Response frames.

6.5  Operation

   This is the active operation state of the WLAN in which short-term
   dynamics are examined.

   The WTP begins operations according to the operational parameters
   exchanged in the previous Configuration state.

   The AC monitors WTPs according to network administrative policies and
   configurations.

   In order to avoid forceful disconnections of legitimate WTPs after
   successful Operation setup, the AC ignores Capabilities messages
   received with a previously registered WTP identification.

   State transition: Operation -> Capabilities Exchange
        WTP: Upon expiry of WTP Active Presence Timer before receipt of
        Feedback Response message from AC
        AC: Upon expiry of AC Active Presence Timer before receipt of
        Feedback message from WTP

   State transition: Operation -> Initialization
        WTP: Upon receipt of Reset message from AC
        AC: Upon receipt of Reset Response message from WTP

   The following describe major operation aspects of WiCoP.

6.5.1  Updates

   The dynamic nature of WLAN systems requires regular updates to
   network operations.

   The AC sends additional configuration information in the
   Configuration Data messages.  This is applicable to establishment of
   new logical groups, changes to existing logical groups, changes in
   QoS settings etc.  Configuration information is followed by a
   Configure Trigger message.

   The WTP sends a Configure Trigger Response before activating the
   additional configuration information.

   Configuration updates can be used to clear statistics information by
   reflecting initial values.

   An extreme case of configuration update involves use of the Reset
   message from the AC, which instructs the WTP to revert to initial
   conditions.  The WTP replies with a Reset Response message before
   reverting to its initial state.

6.5.2  Feedback and Statistics

   The Operation state also sees regular feedback being sent by WTPs to
   the AC.

   The WTP sends Feedback messages to indicate various statistics and
   congestion condition information.  Feedback also includes information
   on the state of the WTP and wireless medium such as queue levels and
   channel interference.  Feedback messages are sent with a frequency
   defined by the Feedback Interval.  In addition to statistics, the
   Feedback message also serves as a WTP keepalive indicator to the AC.
   So Feedback messages combine statistics information together with WTP
   status information.

   The AC monitors Feedback messages for their statistics value and
   implicit indication of WTP activity.  The AC also tracks the state of
   congestion at wireless terminals and WTPs.  This information enables
   the AC to adapt its downstream transmissions, such as scheduling
   transmission away from congested WTPs, so as to relieve congestion.

Internet-Draft                    WiCoP                        June 2005


   The AC additionally uses the Feedback message to randomly determine
   the active state of WTPs.  An active WTP replies with a corresponding
   Feedback Response message.

6.5.3  Non-periodic Events

   The WTP and AC use the Notification message for non-periodic events.
   They send Notification messages to indicate error conditions or
   drastic changes in congestion state.

   The recipient of the Notification message acknowledges with a
   Notification Response message.  The response may contain information
   on rectifying the error or may simply be an acknowledgement of the
   Notification.

6.5.4  Firmware Trigger

   The AC sends a Firmware Download message to update firmware at WTPs.
   The Firmware Download message contains TFTP information, which the
   WTP uses to refresh its firmware.  This is used when a new version of
   firmware is available for the WTPs.

   The WTP acknowledges new firmware with a Firmware Download Response
   message after which it is activated.

6.5.5  Wireless Terminal Management

   The Operation state of WiCoP also involves configuration of WTPs and
   the AC with wireless terminal specific information.

   Here the Terminal Addition message is used in response to a new
   wireless terminal entering the WLAN.  This message may be sent by
   either the WTPs or the AC depending on the WiCoP interface being
   used.  The recipient of this message replies with the Terminal
   Addition Response message.

   The Terminal Deletion message is used when a wireless terminal leaves
   the WLAN.  This is used to delete state information that was
   maintained by either the WTPs or the AC.  It is acknowledged with the
   Terminal Deletion Response message.

   Figure 8 below illustrates the exchange of Terminal Addition and
   Terminal Deletion messages for both local-MAC and split-MAC based
   WiCoP interfaces.

   Here the WiCoP Terminal Addition message is triggered as a response
   to IEEE 802.11 Association message.  In the case of local-MAC
   architecture, the WTP sends the message to the AC.  However, in the

6.5.6  Key Configuration

   One of the differences between split-MAC and local-MAC WTPs is the
   location of the over-the-air encryption.  Some split-MAC and local-
   MAC WTPs perform encryption locally while others leave it to the AC.
   WiCoP accommodates these differences by enabling security key
   configuration in those cases where encryption is performed at the
   WTP.  The encryption setup process is therefore contingent on the
   WiCoP protocol interface.

   When dynamic WEP is used, the WiCoP Key Configuration message is used
   to notify WTPs of encryption keys for each associated wireless
   terminal.  Here, the EAPoL Key frame is encapsulated in the Key
   Configuration message and sent to a WTP.  Upon receiving the Key
   Configuration message, the WTP sets the encryption key in its local
   security table, decapsulates the EAPOL Key frame and forwards it to
   the wireless terminal.  This is illustrated in Figure 9.

   authenticator is located at the AC and encryption points at WTPs, the
   exchanges of the 4-way handshake are managed distinctly.  This is
   because the AC is no longer in a position to calculate the KeyMIC as
   it is not aware of the KeyRSC sequence counter.  So here, WiCoP Key
   Configuration message is used to transport the 3rd message of the
   4-way handshake - containing the EAPoL-Key - with unassigned KeyRSC
   and KeyMIC fields.  When the WTP receives the WiCoP Key Configuration
   message, it first assigns the sequence number value to the KeyRSC
   field.  Then, the WTP calculates the KeyMIC value using the PTK and
   KeyRSC.  So the WiCoP Key Configuration message allows the KeyMIC to
   be calculated at the WTPs instead of the AC.  The GTK-Flag message
   element is used to deterermine how the KeyMIC is calculated - in case
   of new GTK, KeyMIC is computed with a KeyRSC value of 0 and in case
   of an existing GTK, KeyMIC is computed with a KeyRSC value
   corresponding to the actual counter.

   Figure 10 illustrates this case where the WiCoP common header is
   either 'M' = 0 and 'D' = 0 or 'M' = 1 and 'D' = 1.

   The 1st, 2nd and 4th messages of the 4-way handshake are transported
   in WiCoP data packets that are assigned priorities similar to that of
   WiCoP control packets.

   Similarly, for the group key handshake in WPA and IEEE 802.11i, the
   1st message of the handshake is transported using the WiCoP Key
   Configuration message with unassigned KeyRSC.  The WTP again assigns
   the sequence number value to the KeyRSC and then calculates the
   KeyMIC.  The 2nd message of the handshake however is transported in
   WiCoP data packets with priorities similar to that of WiCoP control
   packets.  This is illustrated in Figure 11.

   The Key Configuration Response message is used by the WTP to notify
   the AC of the encryption setup process.

7.  WiCoP Performance

   WiCoP is an efficient protocol.  This section illustrates various
   examples of its efficiency.

7.1  Operational Efficiency

   The fact that WiCoP requires a single operation to distinguish and
   manage WTPs of different designs makes it operationally efficient.
   Because WiCoP assigns dedicated classification bits in the common
   header, an AC needs to parse incoming packets only once to determine
   the particular manner in which it is to be processed.  Without the
   dedicated classifications in the common header, an AC would have to
   perform a lookup after parsing every incoming packet, which would
   result in delaying processing.  The scale and sensitivity of large-
   scale deployments require that WLAN control protocols be efficient in
   operation.

7.2  Semantic Efficiency

   In certain cases, WiCoP combines utilities in a single operation.
   One particular case is that of statistics and activity feedback.
   Here, WTPs send regularly send a single Feedback message containing
   statistics and other state information, which also acts as an
   implicit keepalive mechanism.  This helps to reduce the number of
   message exchanges and also simplifies protocol implementation.
   Similarly, the Capabilities messages serves the purpose of finding
   ACs and also informing them of WTP capabilities and design.

8.  Summary and Conclusion

   The Wireless LAN Control Protocol presents a solution for managing
   large-scale WLANs with diverse elements.  It addresses the challenges
   presented in the CAPWAP Problem Statement [I-D.ietf-capwap-problem-
   statement] and realizes the requirements of the CAPWAP Objectives
   [I-D.ietf-capwap-objectives].

   WiCoP enables integral control of split-MAC and local-MAC WTPs by
   defining appropriate differentiators within the protocol message
   exchanges and processes.  It addresses architecture designs in which
   the authenticator and encryption points are located on distinct
   entities.  And in doing so, WiCoP realizes the interoperability
   objective and its benefits.

   WiCoP also addresses shared WLAN deployments by configuring and
   managing WTPs on a logical group basis.  It is further provisioned to
   separate control and data traffic within WLANs.  So the protocol
   addresses the objectives of logical groups and traffic separation.

   Overall, the specifications presented in this document allows for an
   effective WLAN control and provisioning protocol.

9.  Security Considerations

   Illegitimate WTPs and ACs pose a significant threat to WLAN security.
   This can be mitigated by requiring all WiCoP entities to be mutually
   authenticated before initiating critical protocol exchanges.  WiCoP
   includes a trigger for a suitable authentication mechanism.  This is
   to accommodate different security mechanism that may be used between
   WTPs and AC depending on the nature of the deployment.

   In extension to mutual authentication, the subsequent exchange of
   protocol information between WTPs and AC need to be protected.  The
   exchanges have to be protected against alterations of any sort and
   DoS attacks.  Also, the information should not be accessible to any
   third party.  Encryption of protocol exchanges is therefore
   necessary.  WiCoP includes appropriate procedures to select and
   establish a security assocition between WTPs and AC in the Connection
   state.

   Architecture designs in which authentication is performed at the AC
   and encryption at the WTPs can be exposed to the threat of replay
   attacks.  Since the AC will not be aware of the exact value of the
   sequence counter, it will not make the corresponding assignment
   within the 4-way handshake.  This leaves the wireless terminal to
   accept all incoming frames including illegitimate frames as it cannot
   verify the sequence counter value.  Such a threat needs to protected
   against by allowing the WTP to assign the correct value of the
   sequence counter.  WiCoP accomplishes this by sending the 3rd message
   of the 4-way handshake within a control message to the WTP, which
   then updates the sequence counter field before forwarding to the
   wireless terminals.

   Another issue to consider is that of rogue WTPs using identifiers
   similar to that of legitimate WTPs.  In such instances, a rogue WTP
   can send a Capabilities message to the AC thereby causing
   disconnection of the existing legitimate WTP of the same identifier.
   It is important for the AC to ignore Capabilities messages received
   with existing identifiers.
