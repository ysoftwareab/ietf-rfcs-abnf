Abstract

   The IETF's CAPWAP working group has documented various product
   architectures and has categorized the Centralized WLAN Architectures
   into two main buckets: Split and Local MAC.  While the document
   contains very relevant and useful information, what it does is list
   the architectural variants of these two buckets, but does not
   unambiguously define either the Split MAC or Local MAC architectures.

Internet-Draft       CAPWAP Taxonomy Recommendations           July 2005


   In order for CAPWAP to be successful, it is crucial for the protocol
   evaluation team, and the working group, to agree on unambiguous
   terminology to describe these architectures.

   This document proposes terminology to unambiguously describe the
   relevant architectures found in the taxonomy document, for the
   purpose of initiating a discussion within the working group and to
   allow the protocol evaluation work to come to a fruitful conclusion.
   We conclude in this document that the architectures are very similar
   and could be supported via a single protocol.

Internet-Draft       CAPWAP Taxonomy Recommendations           July 2005


1.  Introduction

   The CAPWAP's taxonomy specification [3] documents various
   architectures, 6 of which are labeled by their proponents to be Split
   MAC and 5 being Local MAC.  In observing the various architectures
   listed, it is clear that there is significant differentiation from
   one vendor to another in the location of various functions among both
   the WTP and the AC.

   Figure 1 (below) comes from the taxonomy draft and shows the location
   of various AP functions across different architectures.  Note that
   the Remote MAC architecture was determined by the Working Group to be
   out of scope for CAPWAP.  In this specification, this table will be
   referred to as the "architecture table".

       +--------------+---    +---------------+---    +--------------+---
       |  CAPWAP      |       |  CAPWAP       |       |  CAPWAP      |
       |  functions   |AC     |  functions    |AC     |  functions   |
       |==============|===    |---------------|       |--------------|
       |              |       |  non RT MAC   |       |              |AC
       |  802.11 MAC  |       |===============|===    |  802.11 MAC  |
       |              |WTP    | Real Time MAC |       |              |

       |  802.11 PHY  |       |  802.11 PHY   |       |  802.11 PHY  |WTP

      Figure 1: Three Architectural Variants within Centralized WLAN
                            Architecture Family

   In reading the above, one can easily understand the primary
   difference between the Local and Split MAC.  The Local MAC
   architecture means that all of the 802.11 functions reside in the
   WTP, while the CAPWAP functions reside in the AC.  Conversely, the
   Split MAC architecture requires that only the real-time functions of
   the 802.11 MAC reside in the WTP, while the AC takes on an additional
   role of participating in the 802.11 MAC management protocol in
   addition to providing the CAPWAP functions.

   The taxonomy draft defines the CAPWAP functions as follows:

   o  RF monitoring, such as Radar detection, noise and interference
      detection and measurement.







Calhoun, et al.         Expires January 16, 2006                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft       CAPWAP Taxonomy Recommendations           July 2005


   o  RF configuration, e.g., for retransmission, channel selection,
      transmission power adjustment, etc.

   o  WTP configuration, e.g., for SSID, etc.

   o  WTP firmware loading, e.g., automatic loading and upgrading of WTP
      firmware for network wide consistency.

   o  Network-wide STA state information database, including the
      information needed to support value-added services, such as
      mobility, load balancing etc.

   o  Mutual authentication between network entities, e.g., for AC and
      WTP authentication in a Centralized WLAN Architecture.

   Given the above conclusions, where a Local MAC architecture's AC only
   provides the above functions, the following paragraph, found in the
   taxonomy document, comes to a different conclusion:

      The commonalities and differences between Local MAC and Split MAC
      are most clearly seen by comparing Figure 7 and Figure 10.  The
      commonality between the two is that 802.11 control frames are
      terminated at WTPs in both cases.  The main difference between
      Local MAC and Split MAC is that in the latter the WTP terminates
      only the 802.11 control frames, while in the former the WTP may
      terminate all 802.11 frames.  An interesting consequence of this
      difference is that the Integration Service, which essentially
      refers to bridging between 802.11 and 802.3 frames, is implemented
      by the AC in the Split MAC, but can be part of either the AC or
      WTP in the Local MAC.

   The above paragraph clearly creates a contradiction between the
   "architecture table" and the local MAC architectures surveyed.  Most
   importantly is the fact that in certain local MAC architectures, the
   Integration and Distribution Functions reside in the WTP while in
   others they exist in the AC.  As per the "architecture table", a
   protocol whose Integration and Distribution Functions reside in the
   AC is by definition a Split MAC architecture.

   Some of the confusion stems from the actual definition of a Split MAC
   architecture, which is copied here from the taxonomy specification:

      Split MAC Architecture: A sub-group of the Centralized WLAN
      Architecture, with the characteristic that WTPs in such WLAN
      access networks only implement the delay sensitive MAC services
      (including all control frames and some management frames) for IEEE
      802.11, while tunneling all the remaining management and data
      frames to AC for centralized processing.  The IEEE 802.11 MAC, as



Calhoun, et al.         Expires January 16, 2006                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft       CAPWAP Taxonomy Recommendations           July 2005


      defined by IEEE 802.11 Standards in [1], is effectively split
      between the WTP and AC.

   If one were to use the strict definition above, an architecture that
   terminates the MAC in the WTP, but tunnels traffic to the AC would be
   considered Local MAC.  It is important to note that in order for the
   AC to properly terminate these "data tunnels", it must somehow
   communicate STA information to the AC.  Therefore, an architecture
   that takes an 802.11 MAC management message and reformats it into a
   different packet, containing much of the same information, which is
   then sent to the AC for processing and tunnels data traffic could be
   considered a Local MAC.  However, the functionality provided by such
   an architecture is nearly identical to a Split MAC architecture, and
   the only difference is where the authors of the architecture sliced
   the AP function.

   It is believed that the crux of the issue is in terminology.  If the
   CAPWAP working group had used the terminology Split AP and Local AP
   instead of MAC, this confusion could have been avoided.  The term MAC
   implies that the 802.11 MAC has been split as opposed to AP
   functions.

   In this document we will attempt to provide a clearer definition of
   both architectures by focusing on functions rather than terminology,
   and will therefore use the terms Split and Local AP.  The proposals
   in this document are intended to initiate discussions and gain some
   level of consensus on the architectures.

2.  CAPWAP Functions

   The CAPWAP taxonomy specification defines the CAPWAP functions, which
   are also described in Section 1 of this document.  In order to ensure
   compatibility among CAPWAP devices, it is necessary to come to
   agreement on the location of the various CAPWAP Functions.

   There was a surprising amount of similarity in the placement of the
   CAPWAP functions across all architectures within a given category in
   the taxonomy specification.  From that document, Figure 2 attempts to
   use the most consistent location for each function and proposes a
   model for both the Local and Split architecture.

   Note when a function appears to reside in both network elements
   (e.g., WTP/AC), it implies that this is a split function among both
   the WTP and the AC.

3.  Split AP

   It is clear that there are significant similarities among most of the
   Split MAC architectures, and as a consequence providing a proposed
   architecture here should be simpler.  In this section we attempt to
   provide a proposal for a Split AP architecture for the CAPWAP working
   group.  The following paragraphs are found in the taxonomy
   specification and provide a high level view of the "CAPWAP 802.11 MAC
   Split"

      Since there is no clear definition in the 802.11 specification as
      to which 802.11 MAC functions are considered "real time", each
      vendor has taken the liberty to interpret that in his own way.
      Most vendors agree that the following services of the 802.11 MAC
      are examples of real time services and so are chosen to be
      implemented on the WTPs.

      o  Beacon Generation

      o  Probe Response/Transmission

      o  Processing of Control Frames: RTS/CTS/ACK/PS-Poll/CF-End/CF-ACK

      o  Synchronization

      o  Retransmissions

      o  Transmission Rate Adaptation

      The following list includes examples of non-real-time MAC
      functions as interpreted by most vendors:

      o  Authentication/Deauthentication

      o  Association/Disassociation/Reassociation/Distribution

      o  Integration Services: bridging between 802.11 and 802.3

      o  Privacy: 802.11 Encryption/Decryption

      o  Fragmentation/Defragmentation

   The above list is a good starting place for evaluating a Split AP
   protocol.  However, there are two issues with functions listed as
   residing in the AC:






Calhoun, et al.         Expires January 16, 2006                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft       CAPWAP Taxonomy Recommendations           July 2005


   o  Fragmentation/Defragmentation.  Requiring this function to exist
      in the AC will cause issues with support for 802.11e.  In the
      802.11e specification, and more importantly the HCCA mechanism
      defined, an AP may need to fragment frames in order to fill a
      scheduled service period; thus 802.11e defines this function to be
      realtime for some instance.  Moving this function to the AC is not
      possible since access to the air is required in order to be able
      to react to instantaneous changes in bandwidth, either as a result
      of noise or co-channel interference from adjacent APs or STAs.
      Placing this function in the AC would preclude an implementer from
      using the feature of 802.11e.  In addition, this function is often
      used as part of the retransmission strategy, the control of which
      is in the WTP.

   o  Privacy.  There are two components to Privacy; 802.11 data privacy
      and secure session establishment (802.1X/EAP).  It is agreed that
      the 802.1X/EAP function should reside in the AC.  However, while
      encryption/decryption services could be performed in the WTP in
      most of today's circumstances, this becomes very problematic when
      used in conjunction with HCCA.  As previously noted, HCCA will
      cause frames to be fragmented in order to fill a service period,
      and fragmentation occurs prior to encryption in 802.11.  Requiring
      encryption services in the AC is not possible, again, else it
      preclude an implementer from utilizing these 802.11e features.

   Taking the above information, and assuming that the CAPWAP functions
   are handled in the AC, Figure 3 proposes a functional definition for
   all functions in a Split MAC architecture.

   (1) The messages exchanged between the AC and the WTP do not
   necessarily mean these are 802.11 MAC management packets, but an
   equivalent message would have to be exchanged to allow the AC to
   maintain proper state.  However, note that the introduction of
   802.11r will necessitate the co-location of both 802.11i key
   management and 802.11 MAC Management messages.

4.  Local AP

   The local MAC architecture is one that is not very well defined in
   the taxonomy specification, primarily due to the variations in the
   architectures listed.  The following paragraph can be found in the
   taxonomy document and is central to the architecture being proposed
   in this section (please note all references are against the taxonomy
   specification, not this document):

      The main motivation of Local MAC architecture model, as shown in
      Figure 6.(a), is to offload network access policies and management
      functions (CAPWAP functions described in Section 2.2) to the AC,
      without splitting the 802.11 MAC functionality between WTPs and
      AC.  The whole 802.11 MAC resides on the WTPs locally, including
      all the 802.11 management and control frame processing for the
      STAs; on the other hand, information related to management and
      configuration of the WTP devices is communicated with a
      centralized AC, to facilitate management of the network, and
      maintain a consistent network-wide configuration for the WTP
      devices.

   There appears to be some confusion as to what a local MAC
   architecture means in the various implementations listed in the
   taxonomy document.  For instance, an implementation that takes an
   802.11 MAC management packet and creates a separate request, which is
   forwarded for processing at the AC, is sometimes considered a Local
   MAC.  This is primarily due to the fact that the actual 802.11 MAC
   protocol never leaves the WTP.  While this is correct in principle,
   the reality is that the functionality provided by such a solution
   would be identical in nature to a Split MAC approach.  As a
   consequence, this document assumes that even though these
   architectures were classified as being Local MAC in the taxonomy
   document, they are really Split MAC (but implemented in a slightly
   different way).

   This section will attempt to provide a proposal for a local AP
   architecture that the CAPWAP WG could consider.

   Using the above assumptions, all of the 802.11 MAC resides on the
   Local AP WTP and only the CAPWAP functions are found on the AC.
   However, it is important to note that the 802.11i components in
   Figure 4 overlap directly with the "STA State Info Database" CAPWAP
   function described in Figure 2.  As a consequence, it is only natural
   to locate the 802.1X and Key Management 802.11i functions centrally
   in the AC.

   The resulting function distribution for a Local AP architecture can
   be found in Figure 4

      Figure 4: Mapping of 802.11 Functions for Local AP Architecture

   To summarize, a Local AP architecture is one where all of the normal
   802.11 AP functions, with the exception of 802.1X and the 802.11i key
   management functions, reside in the WTP, but centralized control and
   provisioning, defined as CAPWAP functions, reside in the AC.

5.  CAPWAP Signalling

   The issue that remains at this point is whether a single protocol is
   capable of supporting both Split and Local AP modes.  The primary
   differences between both is that a Local AP implementation is
   generally used in network deployments where a long latency link
   exists between the WTP and the AC.  Therefore, it is not realistic to
   expect that the MAC management response times assumptions in 802.11
   stations can be supported if the MAC management packets had to
   traverse a high latency network towards the AC.

   As a result, certain Local MAC implementations have created an agent
   that sits at the 802.11 SME layer on the WTP.  This agent simply
   creates a protocol PDU based on the information received at the SME,
   and forwards it to the AC (see Figure 5.

                        Figure 5: Local AP Diagram

   While creating an SME agent at the WTP is one method of implementing
   a Local AP architecture, there is an alternative that allows for a
   single CAPWAP protocol to be used by both Split and Local AP
   architectures.  This method is known as Proxy MAC, whereby the WTP
   actually processes the MAC management frames received, and then
   forwards these frames to the AC.  This allows the AC to be notified
   of SME events at the WTP, while allowing this to be provided by
   simply encapsulating the 802.11 MAC management frames.

   This Proxy MAC mechanism is agnostic to wireless MAC technology.  A
   Proxy MAC function can be applied to other wireless MAC technologies
   to allow a WTP to transmit MAC-specific events to the AC.

6.  Capabilities Negotiation

   Many of the discussions in the CAPWAP mailing list have revolved
   around the need for flexibility, and as such, the need to provide
   multiple optional features that would be negotiated between the WTP
   and the AC.  The introduction of optional features is a means to
   introduce interoperability issues.  This is clearly seen in some
   CAPWAP proposals that lay out a complex options matrix, allowing for
   a large number of combinations.

   While it is not possible to eliminate all of the options in a
   protocol or architecture, it is clear that the presence of such
   options must not create interoperability issues, must be limited in
   number, and have clear mandatory to implement modes.  In the end, the
   CAPWAP WG serves the Internet Community, and not resolving this issue
   simply places the burden on the end customer, causing them to try to
   figure out how to get multiple CAPWAP compliant devices to
   interoperate.

   This document suggests out of the box interoperability by proposing
   the following CAPWAP protocol options, with specific default values:

   o  Data Path Tunneling: While some proposals encapsulate the user
      frames in their natural 802.11 form, other proposals prefer the
      use of 802.3, a clear indication of an interoperability issue.
      However, if one were to make Local AP, meaning local bridging of
      user frames, be the default (mandatory to implement) mode, then
      interoperability would be guaranteed, and Split AP mode could be
      enabled only if both the AC and the WTP supported the same
      encapsulation format.

   o  Split vs. Local AP: The WG needs to pick a mandatory to implement
      mode for handling MAC Management frames.  A recommendation is
      local AP.

   o  Split AP Encryption Mode: Given the issues discussed in this
      document regarding support for HCCA, the only reasonable mandatory
      to implement encryption mode is in the WTP.  Further, this is only
      natural as all 802.11 MACs today support the 802.11i encryption
      mechanisms in hardware.  The CAPWAP protocol MUST allow for
      negotiation of encryption in the AC.

7.  Conclusion

   We have defined both the Local and Split AP architectures in the
   previous sections.  The observations described in this document
   clearly outline their differences.  To summarize, these are:

   o  Data Path Tunneling: In a Split AP approach, all of the 802.11
      data frames are tunneled to the AC, while a Local AP design would
      require the WTP to locally bridge the traffic.

   o  802.11 Functions: In a Split AP approach, the 802.11 MAC
      management functions reside in the AC.  In the Local AP
      architecture all of the access control decisions reside in the
      WTP, while the 802.1X authenticator resides in the AC.

   This document has also observed that a single protocol could provide
   both Local and Split AP modes, through the introduction of Proxy MAC.
   This method allows the AC to be notified of SME events, without
   requiring a new protocol, significantly simplifying the task of the
   Working Group.

   Lastly, this document has listed a small number of CAPWAP
   architectures, with specific default (mandatory to implement) values,
   guaranteeing interoperability among any CAPWAP compliant devices.

   The CAPWAP working group should seriously consider the Split and
   Local AP architectures defined in this document, allowing the working
   group to put aside the bagagge associated with the concept of
   splitting the MAC and focus instead on splitting the AP functions.
