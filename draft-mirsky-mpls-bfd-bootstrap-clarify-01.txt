1.  Introduction

   [RFC5884] defines how LSP Ping [RFC8029] uses BFD Discriminator TLV
   to bootstrap Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) session over
   MPLS Label Switch Path (LSP).  Implementation and operational
   experiences suggest that two aspects of using LSP ping to bootstrap
   BFD session can benefit from clarification.  This document updates
   [RFC5884] in use of Return mode field in MPLS LSP echo request
   message and use of BFD Discriminator TLV in MPLS LSP echo reply.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Use of Return Mode Field

   [RFC5884] does not define the value to be used for the Return mode
   field [RFC8029] when LSP ping is used to bootstrap a BFD session of
   MPLS LSP.  When LSP echo request is being used to detect defects in
   MPLS data plane and verify consistency between the control plane and
   the data plane echo reply is needed to confirm the correct state,
   provide positive acknowledgment.  But when an LSP echo request is
   being used to bootstrap BFD session, then the positive
   acknowledgment, according to [RFC5884] is provided by the egress
   transmitting BFD control message.  Thus LSP echo reply is not
   required to bootstrap BFD session and hence the Return mode field in
   echo request message SHOULD be set to 1 (Do not reply) [RFC8029] when
   LSP echo request used to bootstrap BFD session.

4.  Use of BFD Discriminator TLV in LSP Echo Reply

   [RFC5884] in section 6 defines that echo reply by the egress LSR to
   BFD bootstrapping echo request MAY include BFD Discriminator TLV with
   locally assigned discriminator value for the BFD session.  But the
   [RFC5884] does not define how the ingress LSR may use the returned
   value.  From a practical point, as discussed in Section 3, the
   returned value is not useful since the egress is required to send the
   BFD control message right after successfully validating the FEC and
   before sending an echo reply message.  Secondly, identifying the
   corresponding BFD session at ingress without returning its
   discriminator presents an unnecessary challenge for the
   implementation.  Thus the egress LSR SHOULD NOT include BFD
   Discriminator TLV if sending echo reply to BFD bootstrapping echo
   request.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any action by IANA.  This section may
   be removed.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce new security aspects but inherits
   all security considerations from [RFC5880], [RFC5884], [RFC8029].
