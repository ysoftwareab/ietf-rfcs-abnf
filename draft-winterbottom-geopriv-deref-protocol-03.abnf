              [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]

      The default TCP port for the "held:" URI scheme is 443, since use
      of this URI implies use of HTTP over TLS [RFC2818].  User
      information MUST NOT be included in a "held:" URI, inclusion of
      these parameters in the ABNF is allowed only to retain
      compatibility with "http:" and "https:" URIs.
