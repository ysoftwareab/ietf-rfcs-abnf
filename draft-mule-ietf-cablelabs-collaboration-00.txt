   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


1. Introduction

   This document contains a set of principles and guidelines that serves
   as the basis for establishing a cooperation framework between the



Mule, Townsley               Informational                      [Page 2]


INTERNET DRAFT               Cablelabs-IETF                 October 2005


   Cable Television Laboratories, Inc. and the Internet Engineering Task
   Force (IETF).  This cooperation is intended to secure timely
   development of technical specifications that facilitate maximum
   interoperability with existing Internet systems, devices, and
   protocols.

   CableLabs is nonprofit research and development consortium that is
   dedicated to pursuing new cable telecommunications technologies and
   to helping its cable operator members integrate those technical
   advancements into their business objectives. Within CableLabs,
   specification activities are organized into projects like CableHome,
   DOCSIS, PacketCable and OpenCable and technical work is conducted in
   focus teams. Product vendors or manufacturers are invited to join the
   focus teams which create technical specifications. From time to time,
   CableLabs submits specifications or technical requirements to IETF.
   CableLabs also references IETF Request For Comments in its
   specifications. The list of CableLabs projects and Specifications
   available publicly can be found at the CableLabs web site,
   <http://www.cablelabs.com>.

   Within the IETF, activities are undertaken within a framework of
   Areas, with specific activities being undertaken by working groups
   that are chartered within each Area.  Working group output is
   reviewed by the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) and
   published by the RFC-Editor.  IETF activities are based on a
   principle of open contribution and participation by any interested
   party.  Information on IETF working groups, current work item drafts,
   meeting schedules, and mailing lists are published on the IETF web
   site, <http://www.ietf.org>.

   The IETF and CableLabs, are cooperating with a mutual desire to
   support the integrity of specifications developed by each body.
   CableLabs does not develop standards other than through its
   participation with Standards Defining Organizations (SDOs) like the
   IETF.

   The preferred approach is that the CableLabs uses the Internet
   standards unchanged, if feasible, and communicates requirements for
   change to the IETF, as needed.  The parties intend to work together
   in an effort to avoid duplication of work.

   Each organization will operate according to its own rules and
   procedures, including rules governing Intellectual Property Rights
   (IPR), specification elaboration, approval, and maintenance.

   This cooperation framework is intended to guide collaborative
   efforts, and should be put into use in as much as it is applicable to
   these efforts.  If either party finds this framework inapplicable,



Mule, Townsley               Informational                      [Page 3]


INTERNET DRAFT               Cablelabs-IETF                 October 2005


   inappropriate or not in its best interests, then it may notify the
   other party so that this framework may be modified or withdrawn, as
   appropriate. Either party should have the right to terminate this
   collaboration for any reason on some agreed-upon period of notice.

2. Basis of Collaboration

   In the further development of CableLabs specifications, the benefit
   of adopting Internet specifications has been identified. Although
   this document recognizes the importance of interoperability of the
   CableLabs specifications with the existing Internet and hence the use
   of IETF standards, CableLabs recognizes that additions or
   modifications might be needed in order to make the IETF Internet
   specifications meet the needs of CableLabs. In such cases, CableLabs,
   directly or via one of the vendor participants or entities working on
   a CableLabs specification will take its concerns directly to the
   appropriate IETF working groups for resolution.  When no appropriate
   working group can be found or it is not known where to direct the
   communication, or in the case of resolution of consequent matters,
   the issue will be raised through the CableLabs designated liaison to
   the IETF.

   The IETF may also need to ask questions of CableLabs in order to
   refine its understanding of CableLabs requirements or may wish to
   offer guidance to CableLabs on the effective use of Internet
   specifications.  Where possible, these communications will occur in
   the context of a discussion between CableLabs and an IETF working
   group.  In the event that a working group level discussion is deemed
   inappropriate for the desired communication, the matter will be
   raised through the IETF's designated liaison to CableLabs.

3.  Document Sharing

   Both CableLabs and the IETF encourage the sharing of specification
   documents and draft requirements that are of mutual interest.

   All IETF documents are publicly available from the IETF web site, and
   discussion of documents is hosted on open mailing lists.

   CableLabs documents intended for public consumption include CableLabs
   Technical Reports and CableLabs Specifications that are in ISSUED
   status. They are published for open access on the CableLabs web site,
   <http://www.cablelabs.com/>.

   CableLabs and the IETF will work to update and exchange, when
   appropriate and on a regular basis, a list of dependencies between
   each organization's specifications and work in progress

INTERNET DRAFT               Cablelabs-IETF                 October 2005



4.  Participation in the IETF Process

   Participation in the IETF process is completely open.  This allows
   CableLabs and any CableLabs vendor contributor to participate to
   whatever extent CableLabs considers appropriate in IETF meetings and
   mailing list discussions to assist the IETF in refining its
   understanding of CableLabs requirements and in meeting requirements
   that the IETF deems appropriate.  This close working relationship
   also offers an excellent opportunity for CableLabs to receive
   informal guidance from IETF on CableLabs use of Internet
   specifications.

   The vast majority of technical discussions and decision making within
   the IETF is undertaken by using open mailing lists.  It is
   recommended that interested individuals subscribe to and participate
   on these lists.

   CableLabs is to be notified of new work to be undertaken by the IETF
   via a nominated IETF liaison notification mechanism 

5.  Designated Liaisons

   When the informal working group level of interaction is insufficient,
   matters can be raised through a liaison channel.  CableLabs and the
   IETF shall each establish liaison functions for communication with
   the other organization and shall appoint one or more individuals to
   those functions. 

5.1.  IETF Liaison to CableLabs

   The preferred way for organizations to work with IETF is through the
   working groups.  However, IETF has a limited number of individual
   liaison roles with other organizations when conditions warrant the
   appointment of a specific person.

   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) shall appoint a specific person
   to serve as the CableLabs Liaison.  The role of the IETF's CableLabs
   Liaison is to act as an initial contact point in IETF for
   administrative aspects of this collaboration that cannot easily be
   handled in other ways (e.g., at a technical level by interactions
   with IETF Working Groups or Area Directors).  It is agreed that the
   role does not carry the expectation of attendance at CableLabs
   meetings or participation in CableLabs specification development



Mule, Townsley               Informational                      [Page 5]


INTERNET DRAFT               Cablelabs-IETF                 October 2005


   processes, and it is anticipated that all liaison efforts assigned to
   this individual will be carried out by electronic mail.  It is
   understood that the liaison does not have the ability to make
   exceptions to, or special provisions for, IETF policies and
   procedures.

   It is expected that the individual appointed to this role would:

      - be informed by CableLabs, when appropriate, of CableLabs
      activities within the IETF,including new work proposals, and be
      able to report those using appropriate channels within the IETF,

      - convey liaisons statements from CableLabs to the IETF, and be
      responsible for shepherding CableLabs communication to the
      relevant parts of the IETF,

      - report to CableLabs on progress with IETF consideration of
      CableLabs liaison statements, and

      - have direct access to the CableLabs technical leadership as well
      as direct access to the IAB and IETF Area Directors, as required.

   CableLabs meetings are normally only open to delegates from CableLabs
   members or those manufacturers who have signed the appropriate
   agreements to work on CableLabs. 

5.2.  CableLabs Liaison to IETF

   The CableLabs shall establish an IETF liaison to be the initial
   contact point in CableLabs for matters pertaining to the CableLabs-
   IETF cooperation.  The CableLabs-IETF liaison function, therefore, is
   expected to work with the concerned IETF and CableLabs projects and
   focus teams and to support the interaction between CableLabs and the
   IETF.

6.  Formal Liaison Statements

   Whenever possible, and as the preferred primary method of
   communication and coordination of activity, communication at the
   working group level is strongly encouraged.

   When deemed necessary, formal communication between CableLabs and
   IETF is also permitted.  These communications are to be recorded in
   the form of Liaison Statements, and the IETF will use the CableLabs
   liaison role to convey these statements between the IETF and
   CableLabs.  All liaison statements made by the IETF or directed to



Mule, Townsley               Informational                      [Page 6]


INTERNET DRAFT               Cablelabs-IETF                 October 2005


   the IETF shall be published by the IETF as public documents.  All
   liaison statements made by the IETF will comply with the IETF IPR
   policy as documented in [RFC3667] and [RFC3668].

7.  Contributions

   CableLabs members or entities working on CableLabs' projects may make
   contributions to the IETF in their capacity as IETF participants,
   under the IETF's IPR policy, as documented in [RFC3667] and
   [RFC3668].

   IETF participants who are also CableLabs members or who have signed
   the appropriate CableLabs rules, including its IPR policy.

   CableLabs mailing lists are not open to the general public.  It is
   recommended that work of mutual interest be discussed on the relevant
   IETF mailing lists.

   CableLabs may make normative references to the IETF Proposed
   Standard, Draft Standard, Standard, Best Common Practice and
   Informational specifications that are published as part of the
   "Request for Comments" (RFC) document series.

8.  Co-development of Documents

   The IETF and CableLabs will not co-develop any documents or material.

9.  Terms of Agreement

9.1  Limitation of Liability

   Neither the IETF or CableLabs makes any representations with respect
   to and does not warrant the accuracy of any information or any
   document.  Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees to
   accept the terms of and reproduce any warranty disclaimers or
   limitations of liability that are included in any reproduction of
   published material made available to it under this cooperation
   framework.

9.2.  General

   a. Neither CableLabs nor the IETF acquires any intellectual or
      industrial property rights under this cooperation framework or
      through any disclosure.  No license to any patent, trademark,
      copyright, or other proprietary right is granted here.

   b. There is no obligation for either CableLabs or the IETF to
      incorporate the materials presented by the other party.

   c. This cooperation framework and the relationship between the IETF
      and CableLabs does not constitute a partnership, joint venture,
      agency, or contract of employment between the IETF and CableLabs.

10. Security Considerations
