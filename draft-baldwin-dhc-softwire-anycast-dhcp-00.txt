               draft-baldwin-dhc-softwire-anycast-dhcp-00

Abstract

   This document specifies a anycast address for DHCP servers and
   extensions to DHCP to allow NAT transversal.  This will allow a host
   on a typical residential LAN to obtain information from one of a
   service provider's DHCP servers.

Internet-Draft               Anycast DHCPv4                     May 2010


1.  Introduction

   In IPv4 broadband deployments it is common practice for a customer's
   hosts to be connected via an IPv4 NAT router which acts a DHCP
   [RFC2131] server for the customer's LAN.  It is often infeasible to
   configure the DHCP server function to provide additional
   configuration information such as the remote endpoint of an IPv6
   tunnel.

                        Typical deployment scenario

           +--------+         +------------+         +----------+
           |  DHCP  |         |  IPv4 CPE  |         | Customer |
           | Server |----+----| NAT/Router |---------|    PC    |
           +--------+    |    +------------+         +----------+
                         |
           +--------+    |
           | Tunnel |----+
           | Server |
           +--------+

   Anycast DHCP solves this problem by allowing the hosts to directly
   contact a service providers DHCP servers.  It is intended to
   supplement existing means of configuration, and is carried out after
   configuration of an IPv4 address.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  DHCPv4 anycast address

   The value of this address is 192.0.0.TBD1.  It SHOULD NOT advertised
   in BGP or an IGP beyond the edge of any organisations network, except
   as aggregated in a default route.


4.  Anycast DHCP control DHCP option

   Unless a node has been manually configured to use or not to use
   Anycast DHCP it MUST request and obey the following option.

Internet-Draft               Anycast DHCPv4                     May 2010


                              Code   Len  Value
                            +------+-----+-----+
                            | TBD2 |  1  |  X  |
                            +------+-----+-----+

   If X = 0 then Anycast DHCP MUST NOT be used.  If X = 2, then Anycast
   DHCP MUST be used.  If the option is not present or X = 1 then
   Anycast DHCP should be used unless the node can determine it is
   managed.  Due care MUST be taken to avoid problems caused by IPv4 DNS
   servers which fail to respond correctly to AAAA queries. [RFC4074]


5.  Protocol Description

   The client obtains configuration information using DHCP as normal.

   After configuring IPv4 connectivity The client sends a DHCPINFORM
   message to 192.0.0.TBD1, UDP port 67.  It SHOULD select an ephemeral
   source port and MUST NOT use port 67 or port 68 as a source port.
   The client should use a retransmission strategy.

   The server responds with a DHCPACK message.  The yiaddr field of the
   response MUST contain the IPv4 address of the client as seen in the
   domain in which the provided configuration information is valid, for
   example the 6RD [I-D.ietf-softwire-ipv6-6rd] DHCP option.  This will
   typically be the client's address seen by the DHCP server.


6.  Relay Agents

   A modified relay agent can be used with an unmodified DHCP server.
   Upon receiving a DHCPINFORM message addressed to the anycast address
   the relay agent sets the chaddr field of the message to the source
   IPv4 address and port of the message and the htype field to TBD3,
   then forwards the message to the DHCP server.  When the reply is
   received back from the DHCP server the client IPv4 address is copied
   from the chaddr field to the yiaddr field, then the message is
   forwarded to the IPv4 address and UDP port contained in hwaddr field
   of the message.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a IPv4 address from the IPv4 special
   purpose address registry (TBD1), a DHCP option (TBD2), and an 8-bit
   ARP hardware type value (TBD3).


8.  Security Considerations

   If Anycast DHCP is enabled by default the node could obtain global
   IPv6 connectivity by means of a tunnel without the knowledge of the
   administrator, and therefore have an inappropriate security policy.
   If Anycast DHCP is included in an automatic update this risk is even
   greater, and nodes SHOULD NOT except incoming IPv6 connections via
   tunnels configured by Anycast DHCP by default unless global
   connectivity is explicitly requested.

   If the Anycast DHCP address is not filtered at the edge of service
   providers network, a third party could provide malicious
   configuration and thereby intercept all IPv6 traffic from the client.

   A malicious server could provide an invalid configuration.
