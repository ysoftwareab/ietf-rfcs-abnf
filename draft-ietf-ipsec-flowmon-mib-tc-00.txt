Internet Draft       IPsec Flow MIB Textual Conventions     17 Mar 2003


Abstract
   This document describes the SMI textual coventions required to
   support the definition of IPsec MIBs. It is necessary to separate
   the definition of the textual conventions into a separate document
   due to their dependence on IANA assigned numbers for transforms
   and Diffie-Hellman groups supported by IPsec protocol.

Internet Draft       IPsec Flow MIB Textual Conventions     17 Mar 2003


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   To support the management needs of IPsec-based networks, we have
   defined the IPsec Flow Monitor MIB (module IPSEC-FLOW-MONITOR-MIB).
   The MIB defines a number of objects with enumeration syntax which
   refer to the numbers assigned by IANA to denote specific elements
   (e.g.: transforms and Diffie-Hellman groups).

   The IANA assigned numbers for ISAKMP and IPsec would continue to
   evolve as new transforms and Diffie-Hellman groups of standardized.
   To insulate the definition of the MIB from these changes, it is
   necessary to define the textual conventions for various types of
   MIB elements in a separate document.

   The purpose of this draft is to define these textual conventions.

   Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 are administrative in nature.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   1) An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [2271].

   2) Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
      purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in RFC
      1155 [1155], RFC 1212 [1212] and RFC 1215 [1215]. The second
      version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [1902],RFC 1903
      [1903] and RFC 1904 [1904].

   3) Message protocols for transferring management information. The
      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
      described in RFC 1157 [1157]. A second version of the SNMP message
      protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
      called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [1901] and RFC 1906
      [1906].  The third version of the message protocol is called
      SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [1906], RFC 2272 [2272] and RFC
      2274 [2274].

Internet Draft       IPsec Flow MIB Textual Conventions     17 Mar 2003


   4) Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
      described in RFC 1157 [1157]. A second set of protocol operations
      and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [1905].

   5) A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [2273] and
      the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275
      [2275].

5.  Security Considerations

   Since this MIB defines only textual conventions, there are no
   security considerations.  Security considerations exist only when
   managed objects are defined with these textual conventions.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document is the MIB definitions corresponding to a group of
   assigned numbers which are maintained by the IANA.  The IANA will
   maintain the MIB in this document as they make new assignments.

   This MIB will be maintained in the same manner as the IANAifType-MIB.


7.  Revision History

   This section will be removed before publication.
