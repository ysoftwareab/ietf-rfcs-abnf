Abstract

   This document presents a method to manage the assignment of bits of
   an IPv6 address block or range. When an organisation needs to make
   an address plan for its subnets or when an ISP needs to make an
   address plan for allocating address ranges to its customers, this
   method enables the organisation to postpone the final decision on
   the number of bits to partition in the address space they have. It
   does it by keeping the bits around the borders of the partition to
   be free as long as possible.  This scheme is applicable to any bits
   addressing scheme using bits with partitions in the space, but its
   first intended use is for IPv6. It is a generalization of RFC1219
   and can be used for IPv6 assignments based on RFC2373 and RFC2374.

Internet-Draft    A flexible method for managing the assignment of bits of an IPv6 address block                                  March 2001


1. Rationale

   IPv6 addresses have a more flexible structure for address
   assignments than IPv4 where no pre-defined prefixes (called
   subnetmasks in IPv4) are used (except a few special cases).  It
   enables registries, internet service providers, network designers
   and others to assign addresses ranges to organisations and networks
   based on different criterias, like size of networks, estimated
   growth rate, etc.  Often, the initial assignation doesn't scale well
   because a small network becomes larger than expected, needing more
   addresses. But then, the assignment autority cannot allocate
   contiguous addresses because they were already assigned to another
   network. 

   RFC1219 describes an allocation scheme for IPv4 where address space
   is kept unallocated between the leftmost bits of the subnet part and
   the rightmost bits of the host part of the address. This enables the
   network designer to change the subnetmask without renumbering, for
   the central bits that were not allocated. 

   This work generalizes the previous scheme by extending the algorithm
   so it can be applied on any part of an IP address, which are
   assigned by any assignment autority level (TLA, registries, ISPs,
   organisations, ...).  It can be used for both IPv4 and IPv6, with
   IPv6 assignments conforming to RFC2373 and RFC2374. 

   This document is not an IPv6 address allocation plan, but can be
   used as a method for allocation plans, and is independent of any
   specific internet address registry ipv6 allocation plan.

2. Scheme

   We define parts of the IP address as p1, p2 , p3, ... pN in order,
   so that an IP address is composed of these parts contiguously. 
   Boundaries between each part are based on the prefix assigned by the
   next level assignment autority. Part p1 is the leftmost part
   probably assigned to a TLA, Part p2 can be assigned by the TLA to a
   large internet service provider or to a national registry.  Part p3
   can be allocated to a large customer or a smaller provider, etc. 
   Each part can be of different length. We define l(pX) the length of
   part X. 


   +------+------+------+------+------+------+
   | p1   | p2   | p3   | p4   | ...  | pN   |
   +------+------+------+------+------+------+
   <------- ipv6 or ipv4 address ------------>

   The algorithm for allocating addresses is as follows : a) for the
   leftmost part (p1), assign addresses using the leftmost bits first
   b) for the rightmost part (pN), assign addresses using the rightmost
   bits first c) for all other parts (center parts), predefine an
   arbitrary boundary (prefix) and then assign addresses using the
   center bits first of the part being assigned. 

   This algorithm grow assigned bits in such way  that it keeps
   unassigned bits near the boundary of the parts.  This means that the
   prefix between any two parts can be changed forward or backward,
   later on, up to the assigned bits. 

   Any assignment must conform to RFC2373 and RFC2374, which have
   precedence over this method in case of conflicts.

3. Address plan

3.1 leftmost

   p1 will be assigned in order as follows : 


   Order   Assignment
   1 10000000
   2 01000000
   3 11000000
   4 00100000
   5 10100000
   6 01100000
   7 11100000
   8 00010000
   9 ...

    This is actually a mirror of binary counting. 

3.2 rightmost

   pN (the last part) will be assigned in order as follows : 


   Order   Assignment
   1 00000001
   2 00000010
   3 00000011
   4 00000100
   5 00000101
   6 00000110
   7 00000111
   8 00001000
   9 ...

3.3 centermost

   pX (where 1 < X < N) will be assigned in order as follows : (for
   example, with a 8 bit predefined length l(pX)=8))

4. Example

   A TLA has been assigned the 3ffe:0b00/24 prefix and wants to assign
   prefixes to its connected networks.  It anticipates in the forseable
   future a maximum of 256 NLAs consuming 8 bits. One of these NLA,
   named NLA2, anticipates a maximum of 1024 subNLA assignments under
   it, consuming 10 other bits. 

   The assignment will be as follows, not showing the first 24 leftmost
   bits (3ffe:0b00/24: 00111111 11111110 00001011): 

   TLA assigning to NLAs using lefmost bits: 


   10000000  : assigned to NLA1
   01000000  : assigned to NLA2
   11000000  : assigned to NLA3
   00100000  : assigned to NLA4
   ...

   NLA2 assigning to its subNLAs using centermost bits: 


   0000010000 : assigned to subNLA1
   0000100000 : assigned to subNLA2
   0000110000 : assigned to subNLA3
   ...

   subNLAs can use centermost bits for maximum flexibility and then the
   last aggregators (should be a network in a site) will be assigned
   using rightmost bits. 


   Putting all bits together for subNLA3:
   TLA                       |NLA2    |subNLA3
   00111111 11111110 00001011 01000000 00001100 00
                                 <------->    <------>
                                     growing bits

   By using this method, the TLA will be able to expand the number of
   NLAs and the NLAs will be able to modify their first assumptions
   about the size of their subNLAs, until "reserved" bits are assigned.

5. Implementation

   The following perl code was written by Jocelyn Picard
   (Jocelyn.Picard@viagenie.qc.ca) and implements this draft.

   use strict;

   # allocation(Last Prefix,Number of bits,Method)
   #
   #  Last Prefix    = last prefix allocated, ex: 3ffe:b00::/48
   #  Number of bits = range we want to allocate
   #  Method         = method to use: l,c or r (left,center,right)
   #
   #  Returns next prefix using selected method
   #
   # Note: no validation is made
   #
   #---------------------------------------------------------------------
   sub allocation {
    my ($ip,$pl)=split('/',shift);
    my ($nbits,$method) = @_ ;
    my ($w,@Abits,$abits);

    my $i = $ip =~  s/:/:/g;
    my $repl= ':0' x (9 - $i);
    $ip =~ s/::/$repl/;
    $ip =~ s/^:/0:/;

    foreach $i (split(':',$ip)) {
     push @Abits, split('',unpack("B16", pack("n", hex($i))));
    }
    my $sp = int($nbits/2);

    for($i=0;$i<$nbits;$i++) {
     if ($method eq "c") {
      $w = ($i % 2) ? $sp - ($i+1)/2: $sp + $i/2;
     }
     elsif ($method eq "r") {
      $w = $nbits -1 - $i;
     }
     else {
      $w = $i ;
     }
      $w += $pl - $nbits;

     if ($Abits[$w] == 0) {

    $ip =~ s/(:0){2,}$/::/;
    return($ip . "/$pl");
   }

   #Usage example: allocation of 100 /48 using "centermost" method
   #
   my $Prefix = '3ffe:b00::/48';

    print $Prefix = allocation($Prefix,16,'c'),"\n";

6. Security Considerations

   Address assignment doesn't seem to have any specific security
   consideration.
