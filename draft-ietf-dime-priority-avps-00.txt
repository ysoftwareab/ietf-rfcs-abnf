Abstract

   This document  defines  Attribute-Value  Pair  (AVP)  containers  for
   various  priority  parameters  for  use  with  Diameter  and  the AAA
   framework.   The  parameters  themselves  are  defined   in   several
   different protocols that operate at either the network or application

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a number of Attribute-Value Pairs  (AVPs)  that
   can  be  used  within  the  Diameter  protocol  [RFC3588] to convey a
   specific set of priority parameters.  The parameters  themselves  are
   specified in other documents, but are described briefly below.

   Priority influences the distribution of  resources.   This  influence
   may  be  probabilistic,  ranging  between  (but not including) 0% and
   100%, or it may be in the form of a guarantee to  either  receive  or
   not receive the resource.

   The influence attributed to prioritization may also affect  QoS,  but
   it  is not to be confused with QoS.  As an example, if packets of two
   or  more  flows  are  contending  for  the  same  shared   resources,
   prioritization  helps  determine  which packet receives the resource.
   However, this allocation of resource does not correlate  directly  to
   any  specific delay or loss bounds that have been associated with the
   packet.

   Another example of how prioritization can be realized is  articulated
   in   Appendix  A.3  (the  priority  by-pass  model)  of  [draft.rsvp-
   priority-extension].  In this case, prioritized flows may gain access
   to resources that are never shared with non-prioritized flows.


2.  Terminology and Abbreviations

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",  "SHALL  NOT",
   "SHOULD",  "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Priority Parameter Encoding

   This section defines a set of priority AVPs.  This  set  is  for  use
   with  the  DIAMETER  QoS application and represents a continuation of
   the list of AVPs defined in [RFC5624]. The syntax  notation  used  is
   that of [RFC3588].

   3.1.  Dual-Priority AVP


   The Dual-Priority AVP is a grouped AVP consisting of  two  AVPs;  the
   Preemption-Priority  and  the Defending-Priority AVP.  These AVPs are
   derived from  the  corresponding  priority  fields  in  the  Signaled

   Preemption  Priority Policy Element [RFC3181] of RSVP [RFC2205].  The
   Defending-Priority is set when the  reservation  has  been  admitted.
   The  Preemption-Priority of a newly requested reservation is compared
   with the Defending Priority  of  a  previously  admitted  flow.   The
   actions taken based upon the result of this comparison are a function
   of local policy.

     Dual-Priority  ::= < AVP Header: TBD >
                 { Preemption-Priority }
                 { Defending-Priority }


3.1.1.  Preemption-Priority AVP

   The Preemption-Priority AVP (AVP Code TBD)  is  of  type  Unsigned32.
   Higher  values  represent higher priority.  The value encoded in this
   AVP is the same as  the  preemption  priority  value  that  would  be
   encoded in the signaled preemption priority policy element.

3.1.2.  Defending-Priority AVP

   The Defending-Priority AVP (AVP Code  TBD)  is  of  type  Unsigned32.
   Higher  values  represent higher priority.  The value encoded in this
   AVP is the same as the defending priority value that would be encoded
   in the signaled preemption priority policy element.


3.2.  Admission-Priority AVP

   The Admission-Priority AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32.

   The  admission  priority  of  the  flow  is  used  to  increase   the
   probability  of  session  establishment  for  selected flows.  Higher
   values represent higher priority.   A  given  admission  priority  is
   encoded  in  this  information  element  using the same value as when
   encoded in the admission priority parameter defined in Section 3.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-emergency-rsvp].

3.3. SIP-RPH AVP

   The SIP-RPH AVP is a grouped AVP consisting of  two  AVPs,  the  SIP-
   Namespace   and  the  SIP-Value  AVP,  which  are  derived  from  the
   corresponding optional header fields in [rfc4412].  The SIP-Namespace
   identifies  a  particular  ordered  set of priority values.  The SIP-
   Value identifies a specific priority value within the set  identified
   by the SIP-Namespace.

Internet Drafts          Resource Priority AVPs             Feb 28, 2009


     SIP-RPH ::= < AVP Header: TBD >
                     { SIP-Namespace }
                     { SIP-Value }

3.3.1.  SIP-Namespace AVP

   The SIP-Namespace AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type UTF8String.

3.3.2 SIP-Value AVP

   The SIP-Value AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type UTF8String.

3.4.  App-Level-Resource-Priority AVP

   The  App-Level-Resource-Priority  (ALRP)  AVP  is   a   grouped   AVP
   consisting  of two AVPs, the ALRP-Namespace AVP and the ALRP-Priority
   AVP.

   A description of the semantics of the parameter values can  be  found
   in  [RFC4412]  and  in [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-emergency-rsvp].  The registry
   set up by [RFC4412] provided string  values  for  both  the  priority
   namespace  and  the  priority  values associated with that namespace.
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-emergency-rsvp]  modifies  that  registry  to  assign
   numerical  values  to both the namespace identifiers and the priority
   values within them.  Consequently,  SIP-RPH  and  App-Level-Resource-
   Priority  AVPs convey the same priority semantics, but with differing
   syntax. The coding for parameters is as follows:

     App-Level-Resource-Priority  ::= < AVP Header: TBD >
                                     { ALRP-Namespace }
                                     { ALRP-Priority }

3.3.1.  ALRP-Namespace AVP

   The ALRP-Namespace AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32.

3.3.2.  ALRP-Priority AVP

   The ALRP-Priority AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32.

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  AVP Codes

   IANA is requested to allocate AVP codes for the following  AVPs  that
