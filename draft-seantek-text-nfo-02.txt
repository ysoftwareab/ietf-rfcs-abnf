Abstract

   This document registers the text/nfo media type for use with release
   iNFOrmation. While mostly compatible with text/plain, ".NFO" files
   and content have unique encoding and rendering characteristics that
   make them distinguishable from typical plain text.

Internet-Draft                iNFOrmation                   October 2015


1. iNFOrmation

   Packagers of files or other bundled content commonly include a common
   human-readable manifest that describes their packages. While an
   obvious solution is to include a README, in an archive such as a ZIP
   file, READMEs are generally written for software applications and
   provide late-breaking instructions on how to configure and install
   the software, along with known bugs and changelogs. (Plain) text
   READMEs are also generally limited to printable US-ASCII characters.

   Starting from circa 1990, packagers of various types of content
   settled upon the Release iNFOrmation format (NFO, commonly pronounced
   "EN-foe" or "info") to describe their releases. An NFO file serves
   similar purposes to a README, but with several nuanced differences.
   NFOs usually contain release information about the media, rather than
   about software per-se. NFOs credit the releasers or packagers. Much
   like the Received: Internet Message header [RFC5322], intermediates
   ("couriers") can also insert NFOs.

   Most distinctly, NFOs have come to contain elaborate ASCII or ANSI
   artwork that is remarkable in its own right in the pantheon of the
   postmodern computing culture. Many NFOs have been authored with the
   intent of displaying them on a terminal display with monospaced,
   inverted text (black background, gray or off-white foreground); some
   NFOs even include escape sequences to generate animations or color.
   The widely accepted encoding for NFOs is "OEM Code Page 437", the
   character set of the original IBM PC and MS-DOS.

   When served in the same manner as plain text (text/plain), a lot of
   the elaborate artwork in NFOs is lost, garbled, or misaligned on
   display. As NFOs are still in considerable use, the goal of this
   registration is to rectify these interchange problems and reclaim
   this piece of living computer history.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2. Release iNFOrmation Media Type Registration Application

   Type name: text

   Subtype name: nfo

   Required parameters:

    charset: Per Section 4.2.1 of [RFC6838], charset is REQUIRED. Unlike
     most other text types, the default value is the character set of
 


Leonard                    Exp. April 6, 2016                   [Page 2]

Internet-Draft                iNFOrmation                   October 2015


     the original IBM PC and MS-DOS, called OEM Code Page 437, and named
     "oem437". Implementations MUST support OEM Code Page 437.
     Unfortunately, the simple application of the IANA registered
     character set "IBM437" (aka "cp437") [RFC1345] will miss some
     important characters, so conformant implementations MUST support
     OEM Code Page 437 as specified in Section 3. NFOs authored for more
     modern computing environments are known to use ISO-8859-1, ISO-
     8859-15 (including support for the Euro sign), or UTF-8; however,
     for maximum interoperability, these or any other character sets
     MUST be declared by the sender. When absent, a receiver MAY guess,
     but SHOULD heavily bias the outcome towards OEM Code Page 437
     unless UTF-8 encoding is patently obvious. A RECOMMENDED detection
     algorithm is provided in Appendix A.

   Optional parameters:

    baud: A natural number (integer greater than 0) indicating the gross
     bit rate at which the NFO is supposed to be rendered to screen.
     This optional parameter provides a nostalgic effect from the days
     of modems and fixed-speed serial lines. It also controls the
     animation rate, to the extent that the NFO employs optional escape
     sequences.

   Encoding considerations:

     Text with 8-bit code points; all 8-bit combinations (including NUL)
     are possible. Accordingly, text SHOULD be quoted-printable or
     base64 encoded when transmitted over a channel that is not 8-bit
     clean.

   Security considerations: 

     It's just text; this format provides no facilities for
     confidentiality or integrity. The ANSI escape sequence "CSI 5 m"
     could, however, blink you to death. As only a subset of ANSI escape
     sequences MUST be interpreted; interpreting a greater range than
     the subset prescribed in this registration may introduce other
     security issues, such as transmitting operating system commands.

     Some code points in oem437 have been used ambiguously in practice,
     so implementations SHOULD NOT assume that the mapping between this
     charset and Unicode is bijective. When displayed, codes 00, 20, and
     FF MAY appear to be similar, i.e., as a blank space.

   Interoperability considerations:

     NFOs are plain text but look best when read in a terminal view or
     with a dedicated NFO viewer that can emulate terminal features. As
 


Leonard                    Exp. April 6, 2016                   [Page 3]

     a result, they SHOULD be treated differently than text/plain files.
     The reference implementation that all NFO viewers SHOULD target is
     an IBM PC-compatible machine running MS-DOS 6.22 with the ANSI.SYS
     MS-DOS device driver loaded, where the NFO is displayed as if it
     were output to the terminal using the "TYPE" command.

   Published specification: [[Note to RFC Editor: Insert number here.]]

   Applications that use this media type:

     NFO viewers; text editors; terminals.

   Fragment identifier considerations:

     Same as text/plain [RFC5147]. Note that escape sequences do not
     contribute to the character count [[NB: do they?]], and line breaks
     are treated as one character, regardless of whether CRLF or some
     other code(s) are used.

   Additional information:

     Deprecated alias names for this type: text/x-nfo
     File extension(s): .nfo
     Macintosh file type code(s):
       TEXT. A uniform type identifier (UTI) of "public.nfo", which
       conforms to "public.plain-text", is RECOMMENDED.

3.  OEM Code Page 437

   "OEM Code Page 437" refers to the character set of the original IBM
   PC and MS-DOS. The code page actually represents two related things:
   the set of 256 graphemes stored in video read-only memory (ROM) that
   are accessed with a single 8-bit code, and an 8-bit encoding for text
   content that displays the graphemes or causes other behavior as
   defined by the code, the operating system, and the loaded device
   drivers. NFO is encoded with the aforementioned 8-bit encoding, which
 


Leonard                    Exp. April 6, 2016                   [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                iNFOrmation                   October 2015


   means that not all 256 graphemes are directly available for use. For
   example, the codes 0D 0A (CR LF) identify a new line; they cannot be
   used directly to express the graphemes U+266A EIGHTH NOTE or U+25D9
   INVERSE WHITE CIRCLE. Suggested mappings to Unicode characters are
   included; however, the mapping is not bijective.

   The registration for IBM437 [RFC1345] is used as a basis for this
   specification, which only elaborates upon the differences. Octets are
   in hexadecimal. The symbols below next to the octets match [RFC1345],
   although the actual character has the meaning described here rather
   than the [RFC1345] meaning.

3.1. Low-Order Codes (00-7F)

   The codes in the 20-7E range are the same as in US-ASCII and IBM437.

   01-06, 0B, 0C, 0E-19, and 1C-1F are displayed as their corresponding
   ROM graphemes.

   00 NUL is displayed (and treated) as a space. Depending on the output
          environment, an implementation MAY map this code to U+0000
          NULL, or U+0020 SPACE.

   07 BEL MAY cause an audible bell sound (beep) to be emitted. Actually
          emitting a sound is not required for conformance. However,
          implementations that progressively render the output MUST
          pause for this code as if a sound were emitted.

   08 BS  causes the prior character to be erased: the prior grapheme is
          displayed and treated as a regular or non-breaking space (SP
          or NBSP), depending on whether the prior character would have
          been breaking or non-breaking.

   09 HT  causes horizontal tabbing, which for purposes of conformance,
          SHOULD produce the equivalent spaces so that the subsequent
          text is aligned on the next 8-character boundary.

   0A LF  causes a new line to be created and the text insertion point
          ("cursor") to be moved to the beginning of that line.

   0D CR  causes the text insertion point ("cursor") to be moved to the
          beginning of the current line. Subsequent text will overwrite
          the characters on the current line, until the cursor moves
          somewhere else. (0A creates and moves the cursor to a new
          line; therefore, 0A in the middle of overwriting the current
          line will not insert or erase any characters that might
          otherwise be on that line.)

   1A SUB is the MS-DOS end-of-file (EOF) marker; it ends the display.
          Codes after 1A MUST NOT be displayed. 1A can be used to
          delimit metadata from the main NFO content, although this
          practice is rarely used for NFOs.

   1B ESC may be the start of an ANSI ESC sequence. If no valid ESC
          sequence is recognized, output the corresponding ROM grapheme
          (U+2190 LEFTWARDS ARROW) and continue normal processing with
          the next code.

   7F DEL is displayed as the corresponding ROM grapheme (U+2302 HOUSE).

3.2. High-Order Codes (80-FF)

   The codes in the 80-AF range are a selection of Latin characters;
   they are the same as in IBM437. A conformant implementation MUST NOT
   treat these codes as C1 control characters.

   The codes in the B0-DF range are box drawing and block characters;
   they are the same as in IBM437.

   The codes in the E0-FF range are for mathematical symbols, which are
   the same as in IBM437, with the following exceptions. The preferred
   Unicode mapping in Microsoft's OEM Code Page 437 documentation is
   designated with [OEMCP437]:

   E1 b*  can be either U+03B2 GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA, or U+00DF LATIN
          SMALL LETTER SHARP S (German Eszett) [OEMCP437]. The two were
          undistinguishable at low resolution on the original IBM
          hardware. Newer grapheme sets, including those of the IBM EGA
          and VGA graphics cards, display this code as the Eszett.
          Unfortunately only context can determine the proper character
          to use.

   E3 p*  can be U+03C0 GREEK SMALL LETTER PI [OEMCP437], U+03A0 GREEK
          CAPITAL LETTER PI, or U+220F N-ARY PRODUCT, depending on the
          particular grapheme used.

   E4 S*  can be either U+03A3 GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA [OEMCP437] or
          U+2211 N-ARY SUMMATION.

   E6 m*  can be either U+00B5 MICRO SIGN [OEMCP437] or U+03BC GREEK
          SMALL LETTER MU.

   EA W*  can be either U+2126 OHM SIGN or U+03A9 GREEK CAPITAL LETTER
          OMEGA [OEMCP437].

   EB d*  is U+03B4 GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA [OEMCP437]. However, it can

Internet-Draft                iNFOrmation                   October 2015


          be used as a surrogate for U+00F0 LATIN SMALL LETTER ETH
          (Icelandic, Faroese, Old English, IPA) or U+2202 PARTIAL
          DIFFERENTIAL.

   ED /0  is U+03C6 GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI [OEMCP437], but in MS-DOS was
          mainly used as U+2205 EMPTY SET. Other possible meanings
          include U+03D5 GREEK PHI SYMBOL (used as a technical symbol,
          with a stroked glyph) (to name angles), U+2300 DIAMETER SIGN,
          or U+00F8 SMALL LETTER O WITH STROKE (as a surrogate).

   EE e*  is U+03B5 GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON [OEMCP437] or U+2208
          ELEMENT OF.

   FF NS  is NBSP, also known as U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE. The ROM grapheme
          is the same as SP (SPACE), i.e., it is blank.

3.3. ANSI Escape Sequences

   To support NFO content containing colors and other goodies, an NFO
   viewer MUST support a subset of "ANSI" escape sequences. (The
   required sequences are not directly related to ANSI, but rather to
   [ANSI.SYS].)

   [ANSI.SYS] supports cursor positioning, erasing, Set Graphics Mode
   (SGR), mode switching, and keyboard remapping. Of these functions, a
   conforming implementation MUST support the Set Graphics Mode (SGR)
   escape sequence. An implementation MUST support setting foreground
   colors (30-37) and background colors (40-47), which are also in
   [ISO6429]. An implementation MUST support all of the [ANSI.SYS] text
   attributes (0, 1, 4, (5 and/or 6), 7, and 8). Text attribute 5 is
   "Blink: Slow" (less than 150 per minute); text attribute 6 is "Blink:
   Fast" (more than 150 per minute). While [ANSI.SYS] does not document
   attribute 6, that was the behavior of the actual ANSI.SYS. An
   implementation SHOULD reproduce similar functionality.

   The other [ANSI.SYS] escape sequences are OPTIONAL. An implementation
   MAY support standard or vendor-specific escape sequences. For a list
   of standard sequences, see, e.g., [ISO6429] and [ISO8613].

3.4. Accessing Hidden Grapheme Codes

   There is no obvious way to encode the graphemes that are inaccessible
   at the values 07, 08, 09, 0A, 0D, 1A, and 1B. This specification
   provides a technique to access these graphemes in the context of OEM
   Code Page 437. This technique is RECOMMENDED, but not required.

   Although MS-DOS and ANSI.SYS did not conform to [ISO2022], that
   standard defines escape sequences to switch to other character sets.
 


Leonard                    Exp. April 6, 2016                   [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                iNFOrmation                   October 2015


   Unicode contains appropriate code points for all of the inaccessible
   graphemes (characters). Accordingly, the escape sequence:
      ESC % G
   switches the code to UTF-8 (with unspecified implementation level)
   [REG196]. While in UTF-8, the escape sequence:
      ESC % @
   reverts the code back to the original [ISO2022]. Normally the code
   would be [ISO2022], but given the starting context of OEM Code Page
   437, the code returns to OEM Code Page 437. The codes are as follows
   (provided in ROM grapheme number, IBM437 symbol, corresponding
   Unicode code point, Unicode character description, and UTF-8
   encoding):

   07 BEL U+2022 BULLET: E2 80 A2

   08 BS  U+25D8 INVERSE BULLET: E2 97 98

   09 HT  U+25CB WHITE CIRCLE: E2 97 8B

   0A LF  U+25D9 INVERSE WHITE CIRCLE: E2 97 99

   0D CR  U+266A EIGHTH NOTE: E2 99 AA

   1A SUB U+2192 RIGHTWARDS ARROW: E2 86 92

   1B ESC U+2190 LEFTWARDS ARROW: E2 86 90

3.5. UTF-8/Unicode Processing

   When NFO content is encoded in UTF-8 or another Unicode encoding
   [UTF], the C0 and C1 code points may be present. These codes MUST be
   treated as control codes, not graphemes. They have the same behavior
   as specified for the special low-order codes described in Section
   3.1. For example, 1A ends the display, and 09 emits spaces sufficient
   for 8-column tabbing. 1B is ALWAYS treated as the start of an ESC
   sequence; if the sequence is not recognized, 1B does NOT revert to
   outputting a LEFTWARDS ARROW grapheme. Instead, nothing is displayed.
   For LEFTWARDS ARROW, encode U+2190 instead.

   The C1 control code 9B (CSI: Control Sequence Introducer) (Unicode
   code point U+009B) MUST be recognized as such; it is equivalent to 1B
   5B (ESC [).

3.6. Grapheme Reference

   The following figure is a reference of all 256 graphemes in the IBM
   PC ROM. The figure is a MIME (base64)-encoded PNG image.

     Charset name: oem437

     Charset aliases: None.

     Suitability for use in MIME text: Suitable.

     Published specification(s): This specification; [OEMCP437].

     ISO 10646 equivalency table:

       This table is taken from the IBM437 registration in [RFC1345],
       with modifications based on actual implementations of [OEMCP437],
       as discussed in this document. Character mnemonic symbols
       generally map to the Unicode code points listed in Section 3
       of [RFC1345], with the following exceptions. The symbol suffix
       $ (for example, HT$) means that the Unicode code point
       mapping is essentially correct, but an implementation might
       need to perform additional or special processing as discussed
       in this document, depending on the output environment.
       The symbol $$ means that this code point has special
       considerations as discussed in this document, so no
       single, definitive Unicode code point mapping can be given.
       Finally, three characters have no corresponding mnemonic
       symbols in Section 3 of [RFC1345], so symbols are defined here:

         $<   25c4   BLACK LEFT-POINTING POINTER

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to register the media type text/nfo in the Standards
   tree using the application provided in Section 2 of this document.

   IANA is asked to register the charset oem437 in the Character Sets
   registry using the application provided in Section 3 of this
   document.

6. Security Considerations

   It's just text; this format provides no facilities for
   confidentiality or integrity. The ANSI escape sequence "CSI 5 m"
   could, however, blink you to death. As only a subset of ANSI escape
   sequences MUST be interpreted; interpreting a greater range than the
   subset prescribed in this registration may introduce other security
   issues, such as transmitting operating system commands.

   Some code points in oem437 have been used ambiguously in practice, so
   implementations SHOULD NOT assume that the mapping between this
   charset and Unicode is bijective. When displayed, codes 00, 20, and
   FF MAY appear to be similar, i.e., as a blank space.

Appendix A.  IBM Code Page 437 vs. UTF-8 Detection Algorithm

   In cases of ambiguity, the following algorithm SHOULD be used to
   detect UTF-8 encoded data in text/nfo content:

   If the octets EF BB BF are present at the beginning => UTF-8.

   Considering all octets in the content:

     If no octets are greater than 7F => oem437.
     If any octets are F5 - FF, C0, or C1 => oem437.
     If any UTF-8 encodings are "ill-formed" => oem437.
     If any UTF-8 encodings represent illegal code points
       (e.g., surrogate code points) => oem437.

     Ragged line tests:

       If display characters decoded with oem437
         result in identical line widths => oem437.
       If display characters decoded with UTF-8
         result in identical line widths => UTF-8.

   Finally:
   => UTF-8 or oem437; prefer oem437.
