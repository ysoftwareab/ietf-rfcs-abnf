     YANG Instance Data Files and their use for Documenting Server
                              Capabilities
               draft-lengyel-netmod-yang-instance-data-04

Abstract

   This document specifies a standard file format for YANG instance
   data, that is data that could be stored in a datastore and whose
   syntax and semantics is defined by YANG models.  Instance data files
   can be used to provide information that is defined in design time.
   There is a need to document Server capabilities (which are often
   specified in design time).  Defining server capabilities is foreseen
   as the most important use of YANG instance data files.

1.  Terminology

   Design time: A time during which a YANG model and the implementation
   behind it is created.  Sometimes in other documents this period is
   divided into design and implementation time.

   Instance Data Set: A named set of data items that can be used as
   instance data in a YANG data tree.

   Instance Data File: A file containing an instance data set formatted
   according to the rules described in this document.

   Target YANG Module: A YANG module for which the instance data set
   contains instance data, like ietf-yang-library in the examples.

2.  Introduction

   A YANG server has a number of server-capabilities that can be
   retrieved from the server using protocols like NETCONF or RESTCONF.
   YANG server capabilities include

Internet-Draft             YANG Instance Data               October 2018


   o  data defined in ietf-yang-library: YANG modules, submodules,
      features, deviations, schema-mounts
      ([I-D.ietf-netconf-rfc7895bis])

   o  datastores supported

   o  alarms supported ([I-D.ietf-ccamp-alarm-module])

   o  data nodes, subtrees that support or do not support on-change
      notifications ([I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push])

   o  netconf-capabilities

   While it is good practice to allow a client to query these
   capabilites from the live YANG server, that is often not enough.
   Most server-capabilities are relatively stable but the fact is that
   some might change.  Looking at the change frequency, we have roughly
   three categories:

   1.  only at upgrade, e.g. introduced with a new SW package

   2.  rarely e.g. due to licensing or HW inserted

   3.  more frequently e.g. a capability might be dependent on the CPU
       or traffic load, although that would be most unusual

   Most capabilities belong to type 1), some to type 2) and a relatively
   small set to type 3).  Many network nodes only have type 1) or type
   1+2) capabilities.  Stable capabilities are usually defined by a
   vendor in design time, before the product is released.  While these
   capabilities can be retrieved from the live server in run-time, there
   is a strong need to provide the same data already during design time.
   (Often only a part of all the server capabilities can be made
   available.)

   Often when a network node is released an associated NMS (network
   management system) is also released with it.  The NMS depends on the
   capabilities of the YANG server.  During NMS implementation
   information about server capabilities is needed.  If the information
   is not available early in some off-line document, but only as
   instance data from the live network node, the NMS implementation will
   be delayed, because it has to wait for the network node to be ready.
   Also assuming that all NMS implementors will have a correctly
   configured network node available to retrieve data from, is a very
   expensive proposition.  (An NMS may handle dozens of node types.)

Internet-Draft             YANG Instance Data               October 2018


   Beside NMS implementors, system integrators and many others also need
   the same information early.  Examples could be model driven testing,
   generating documentation, etc.

   As capabilities are often already known in design time and are
   relativaly stable, it feasible and advantageous to define/document
   them early.  This document specifies a file format for YANG instance
   data that may be used to provide server capability information,
   allowing vendors to specify capabilities early, in design time.

   The same instance data file format can be used for other purposes,
   like providing initial data for any YANG module.  E.g. a basic set of
   access control groups can be provided either by a device vendor or an
   operator using the network device.

2.1.  Data Life cycle

   Data defined or documented in YANG Instance Data Sets may be used for
   preloading a YANG server with this data, but the server may populate
   the data without using the actual file in which case the Instance
   Data File is only used as documentation.

   While such data will usually not change, data documented by Instance
   Data sets MAY be changed by the YANG server itself or by management
   operations.  It is out of scope for this document to specify a method
   to prevent this.  Whether such data changes and if so, when and how,
   SHOULD be described either in the instance data file description
   statement or in some other implementation specific manner.

   YANG Instance data is a snap-shot of information at a specific point
   of time.  If the data changes afterwards this is not represented in
   the instance data set anymore, the valid values can be retrieved in
   run-time via Netconf/Restconf

   Notifications about the change of data documented by Instance Data
   Sets may be supplied by e.g. the Yang-Push mechanism, but it is out
   of scope for this document.

2.2.  Delivery of Instance Data

   Instance data files SHOULD be available without the need for and
   before the instalation of a live YANG server e.g.  via download from
   the vendor's website. or any other way together with other product
   documentation.

2.3.  Use Case 1: Early Documentation of Server Capabilites

   An operator wants to integrate his own, in-house built management
   system with the network node from ACME Systems.  The management
   integration must be ready by the time the first AcmeRouter is
   installed in the network.  To do the integration the operator needs
   the list of supported YANG modules and features.  While this list
   could be read from the ietf-yang-library via Netconf, in order to
   allow time for developing the management integration, the operator
   demands this information early.  The operator will value that this
   information is available in a standard format, that is actually the
   same format that can be read later from the node via Netconf.

   YANG instance data files are used to provide design time information
   about server capabilities.

2.4.  Use Case 2: Preloading Data

   There are parts of the configuration that must be fully configurable
   by the operator, however for which often a semi-standard default
   configuration will be sufficient.

   One example is access control groups/roles and related rules.  While
   a sophisticated operator may define dozens of different groups often
   a basic (read-only operator, read-write system administrator,
   security-administrator) triplet will be enough.  Vendors will often
   provide such default configuration data to make device configuration
   easier for an operator.

   Defining Access control data is a complex task.  To help the device
   vendor pre-defines a set of default groups (/nacm:nacm/groups) and
   rules for these groups to access specific parts of common models
   (/nacm:nacm/rule-list/rule).

   YANG instance data files are used to document and/or preload the
   default configurationp.

2.5.  Use Case 3: Dcoumenting Factory Default Settings

   Nearly every YANG server has a factory default configuration.  If the
   system is really badly misconfigured or if the current configuration
   is to be abandoned the system can be reset to this default.

   In Netconf the <delete-config> operation can be used to do this,
   while in Restconf there are plans to introduce a custom operation for
   this purpose.

Internet-Draft             YANG Instance Data               October 2018


   The operator currently has no way to know what the default
   configuration actually contains.  YANG Instance data can be used to
   document the factory default configuration.

3.  Instance Data File Format

   Two standard formats to represent YANG Instance Data are specified
   based on the XML and JSON encoding.  The XML format is based on
   [RFC7950] while the JSON format is based on [RFC7951].  Later as
   other YANG encodings (e.g.  CBOR) are defined further Instance Data
   formats may be specified.

   For both formats data is placed in a top level auxiliary container
   named "instance-data-set".  The purpose of the container, which is
   not part of the real data itself, is to carry meta-data for the
   complete instance-data-set.

   The XML format SHALL follow the format returned for a NETCONF GET
   operation.  The <data> anydata (which is not part of the real data
   itself) SHALL contain all data that would be inside the <data>
   wrapper element of a reply to the <get> operation.  XML attributes
   SHOULD NOT be present, however if a SW receiving a YANG instance data
   file encounters XML attributes unknown to it, it MUST ignore them,
   allowing them to be used later for other purposes.

   The JSON format SHALL follow the format of the reply returmed for a
   RESTCONF GET request directed at the datastore resource:
   {+restconf}/data.  ETags and Timestamps SHOULD NOT be included, but
   if present SHOULD be ignored.

   A YANG Instance data file MUST contain a single instance data set.
   Instance data MUST conform to the corresponding target YANG Modules
   and follow the XML/JSON encoding rules as defined in [RFC7950] and
   [RFC7951] and use UTF-8 character encoding.  A single instance data
   set MAY contain data for any number of target YANG modules, if needed
   it MAY carry the complete configuraton and state data set for a YANG
   server.  Default values SHOULD NOT but MAY be included.  Config=true
   and config=false data MAY be mixed in the instance data file.
   Instance data files MAY contain partial data sets.  This means
   mandatory, min-elements or require-instance=true constrains MAY be
   violated.

   The name of the file SHOULD be of the form:

      instance-data-set-name ['@' revision-date] ( '.yid' )

      E.g. acme-router-modules@2018-01-25.yid

Internet-Draft             YANG Instance Data               October 2018


   The revision date is optional.  It SHOULD NOT be used if the file is
   stored in a version control system (e.g. git) because the change of
   file names will break the connection between the different revisions
   of the file.

   Meta data, information about the data set itself SHALL be included in
   the instance data set.  This data will be children of the top level
   instance-data-set container as defined in the ietf-instance-data YANG
   module.  Meta data SHALL include:

   o  Name of the instance data set

   Meta data SHOULD include:

   o  Revision date of the instance data set

   o  Description of the instance data set.  The description SHOULD
      contain information whether and how the data can change during the
      lifetime of the YANG server.

   returning the same data.
