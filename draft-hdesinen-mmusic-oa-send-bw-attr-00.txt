1.  Introduction

   RFC 3264 defines SDP Offer/answer model for unicast multimedia
   sessions where information from both participants is needed for the
   complete view of the session.  Per RFC 3264, the bandwidth attribute
   present in SDP offer signals the desired bandwidth that the offer
   would like to receive.  Hence, bandwidth attributes "AS" and "TIAS"
   defined in RFC3550 and RFC3890 respectively can be used as receive
   only attributes in SDP offer/answer model.  A stream receiver
   (Offerer or Answerer) signals the value of "TIAS" based on maximum
   media bitrate it desires to receive.  However, the stream sender
   (Answerer or Offerer) may desire to send media at a maximum bitrate
   much lower than "TIAS" signaled by the receiver.

3.  Background

   Section 5.8 of RFC 4566 defines syntax for "b=" bandwidth attribute.
   It also defines bandwidth type "AS" as the application's concept of
   maximum bandwidth.

   Per Section 6.2 of RFC 3550, for RTP based applications, "AS"
   includes the header overhead due to lower layer transport and network
   protocols (e.g., UDP, IP ) and does not include overhead due to link
   level headers.

   Section 6.2 of RFC 3890 defines bandwidth type "TIAS".  In the
   context of RTP transport, "TIAS" provides the bandwidth for RTP
   payload which includes both payload format header and payload data.
   "TIAS" does not include any other layer overhead including RTP layer.

   Per RFC3264, the bandwidth attribute present in SDP offer signals the
   desired bandwidth that the offer would like to receive.  Hence,
   bandwidth attributes "AS" and "TIAS" defined in RFC 3550 and RFC 3890
   respectively can be used as receive only declarative attributes in
   SDP offer/answer model.

4.  maxsendrate attribute

  'maxsendrate' can be used to signal the maximum media bitrate (in
   bits per second) in 'send' direction of a stream in SDP offer/answer
   model. 'maxsendrate' signals only codec media bitrate including
   any payload format header and does not include any header overhead
   due to transport layers. 'maxsendrate' MUST not be used with a 
   'recvonly' stream.

   ABNF for 'maxsendrate' is TBD.

5.  Use case

   In SDP offer/answer model, answerer's send bitrate for the stream in
   answerer->offerer direction depends on the value of "AS" or "TIAS"
   signaled in the SDP offer.  Answerer may send media at a bit-rate
   much lower than "AS" or "TIAS" signaled by the offerer.  This could
   be due to several reasons including QoS resource limitation over
   answerer's first hop link.  Similarly, offerer's send bitrate for the
   stream in offerer->answerer direction may be much lower than "AS" or
   "TIAS" signaled in SDP answerer.

   Cellular links commonly have some type of QoS negotiation enabling
   the cellular device to learn the maximum bitrate available over the
   first hop link.  Indicating the maximum media send bitrate to the
   receiving device can be beneficial to allocate proper QoS resources
   over last hop link.  This is especially beneficial in preventing
   resource overallocation when the last hop is also a cellular link.

   Bandwidth inequality over first and last hop links can also arise
   when offerer and answerer are on different type of networks.  E.g.,
   Offerer is a cellular device and answerer is a PC phone with wireline
   connection.

   The 'maxsendrate' attribute defined in the above section can be used
   to signal the maximum media bitrate in 'send' direction of a stream.
   For an example usage of this attribute, see section Section 6.

6.  Example

   Alice offers a receive only stream to Bob with maximum receive media
   bitrate 128000bps (H.263 profile 0 level 45).  Bob responds with SDP
   answer by marking the stream as sendonly.  Note that SDP answer from
   Bob does not include any bandwidth attribute as it contains a
   sendonly stream.


   [Offer from Alice]
   m=video 34564 RTP/AVP 96
   a=rtpmap:96 h263-1998/90000
   a=fmtp:96 profile=0; level=45;
   a=TIAS:128000
   a=maxprate:20
   a=recvonly


   [Answer from Bob]
   m=video 46236 RTP/AVP 96
   a=rtpmap:96 h263-1998/90000
   a=fmtp:96 profile=0;level=45;
   a=sendonly

   Due to QoS limitation on its first hop link, Bob can send media at
   maximum bitrate of 64000bps only.  Unaware of Bob's maximum media
   bitrate, Alice overallocates QoS resources on its access (last hop)
   link.  Signaling Bob's maximum media bitrate in the SDP answer can
   help Alice reserve correct QoS resources in its access (last hop)
   link.  The complete offer/answer example with proposed bandwidth
   attribute 'maxsendrate' is shown below.


   [Offer from Alice]
   m=video 34564 RTP/AVP 96
   a=rtpmap:96 h263-1998/90000
   a=fmtp:96 profile=0; level=45;
   a=TIAS:128000
   a=maxprate:20
   a=recvonly


   [Answer from Bob]
   m=video 46236 RTP/AVP 96
   a=rtpmap:96 h263-1998/90000
   a=fmtp:96 profile=0;level=45;
   b=maxsendrate:64000
   a=sendonly
