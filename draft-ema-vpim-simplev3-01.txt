     Internet Draft            VPIM v3                  March 10, 2000 
      
      
     The original detailed proposal for VPIM v3 is contained in [4]. 
      
     This Internet Draft details a proposed simpler approach at VPIM v3. 
     It is intended to follow the baseline goals described in [5].  Given 
     that VPIM v2 [3] is a well defined (or will be when it is revised for 
     clarity and maturity elevation) description of networking voice-only 
     systems using Internet Mail, and that Internet Mail is being used as-
     is for multimedia messaging, there is minimal need for a detailed 
     revision of VPIM to support Unified Messaging. 
      
     It is proposed, that all that is needed is an agreement to use 
     Internet Mail without modification and profile a minimal set of 
     Internet Mail standard features that a VPIM v3 compliant system MUST 
     support.  As all devices become connected with email, VPIM v3 
     compliance will ensure the ability to communicate voice messages 
     between these devices.  
      
      
     4. Message Format 
      
     All messages MUST conform with the Internet Mail format as described 
     in DRUMS [6][7].  Any content type is allowed to be in a message. 
      
     The top level content type on origination of a new, forwarded or 
     reply message SHOULD typically be multipart/mixed.  Although it may 
     also be any other multipart/* such as multipart/voice-message or 
     multipart/related. 
      
     The top level content type on origination of a delivery notification 
     message MUST be either multipart/report. 
      
     An implementation SHOULD use the multipart/voice-message content type 
     as described in [8] to package audio content together as a voice 
     message. 
      
      
     4.1 Voice Message Format 
      
     A message containing a multipart/voice-message content-type at the 
     top level or as the first on the second level (e.g., under 
     multipart/mixed) is implicitly primarily a voice message.  The 
     recipient system may use this to decide to present the message as a 
     voice message. 
      
     Additionally, an originator may choose to indicate that one of the 
     body parts (e.g., the spoken message part) is critical for the 
     delivery of the message.  This would ensure that this part is 
     delivered if others are dropped for delivery to less capable clients.  
     Note that there is no current proposal for this feature.

     5. Transport  
      
     All transport MUST support Internet Mail transport (SMTP/ESMTP) as 
     described in DRUMS [6]. 
      
      
     6. Addressing 
      
     Any valid Internet Mail address MAY be used.   
      
     However, VPIM onramp and offramp implementations MAY require a 
     stricter addressing structure [9].  As a result, the VPIM addressing 
     structure of [9] MUST be supported for recipient addresses in inbound 
     messages and SHOULD be supported for the originator address if 
     required. 
      
     Discovery of an Internet Mail address for a recipient's voice mailbox 
     (and spoken name if applicable) by only knowing the E.164 phone 
     number of the recipient SHOULD be supported [10].  
      
    
     7. Notifications 
      
     DSN MUST be supported [11].  All non-delivery of messages MUST result 
     in a NDN. Partial DSNs (to indicate that one or more contents could 
     not be stored/relayed by the receiving MTA) SHOULD be supported [12]. 
      
     MDN MUST be supported [13].  Partial MDNs (to indicate that one or 
     more contents could not be rendered at the client) SHOULD be 
     supported.  Note that partial MDN is a new concept with no current 
     proposal.  
      
      
     8. Voice Contents 
      
     Voice messages may be contained at any location within a message and 
     MUST be contained in an audio/* content-type.  The parameters 
     described in [3] MUST be used to identify them as voice messages or 
     spoken names.  
      
     The originator's spoken name SHOULD be included with a message.  
     Spoken names (for originators and recipients) SHOULD be included as 
     separate audio contents.  These MAY be referenced from the message 
     header or a vCard.   Spoken names MAY also be included inline with a 
     vCard.  External references SHOULD NOT be used. 
      
     Any voice codec may be used.  An implementation SHOULD determine the 
     recipient capabilities before the sending of a message if possible 
     and choose a codec accordingly (a CONNEG and RESCAP profile is 
     needed).  In the absence of recipient knowledge, implementations 
     compliant with this document:

        MUST play & record:     MS-GSM - audio/wav; codec=31    [14] 
      
        SHOULD play & record:   G.726  - audio/32kadpcm         [15] 
      
     Note for an implementation to interoperate with VPIM v2 it MUST, at a 
     minimum, support play & record of G.726.  
      
     Compliant implementations recording with a WAVE RIFF header MUST add 
     the codec parameter on origination.  However, non-compliant systems 
     may send messages without this parameter. 
      
      
     9. IMAP 
      
     Implementations SHOULD support access to the voice message store 
     using IMAP [16].  The voice extensions described in [17] SHOULD be 
     supported. 
      
      
     10. Backwards Compatibility with VPIM v2 
      
     Because of the wide deployed base of VPIM v2, implementations are 
     encouraged to send messages in a format compatible with VPIM v2 
     systems as described in [3].  Simply, record and encode 
     audio/32kadpcm under a top level multipart/voice-message.   
      
     If a VPIM v3 system has knowledge that the recipient system is VPIM 
     v2 (via CONNEG, RESCAP, LDAP, etc.) it MUST send a VPIM v2 message. 
      
     A VPIM v2 system SHOULD reject a message it cannot render with a DSN 
     indicating the media is unsupported.  A VPIM v3 compliant system 
     SHOULD record this information for future sending, and SHOULD resend 
     the original message in a VPIM v2 format.  
      
      
     11. Security Considerations 
      
     It is anticipated that there are no additional security issues beyond 
     those identified in VPIM v2.
