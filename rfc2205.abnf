ss = 10: Low order 12 bits contain a organization-specific sub-

             Since the traffic control mechanism might substitute a
             different service, this encoding may include some
             representation of the service in use.

u = 0: RSVP rejects the message without updating local
u = 1: RSVP may use message to update local state and forward
             the message.  This means that the message is informational.
