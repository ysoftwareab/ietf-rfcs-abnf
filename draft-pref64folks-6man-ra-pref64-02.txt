1.  Introduction

   NAT64 [RFC6146] with DNS64 [RFC6147] is a widely-deployed mechanism
   to provide IPv4 access on IPv6-only networks.  In order to support
   functions such as local validation of DNSSEC [RFC4033] responses,
   464xlat [RFC6877], and local IPv4 address synthesis [RFC8305], the
   host must be aware of the NAT64 prefix in use by the network.  This
   document specifies a Router Advertisement [RFC4861] option to
   communicate the NAT64 prefix to hosts.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   Pref64: an IPv6 prefix used for IPv6 address synthesis [RFC6146];

   RA Router Advertisement, a message used by IPv6 routers to advertise
   their presence together with various link and Internet parameters
   ([RFC4861]);

   PvD-aware host A host that supports the association of network
   configuration information into PvDs and the use of these PvDs.  Also
   named PvD-aware node in [RFC7556].

2.  Why include the NAT64 prefix in Router Advertisements

   Fate sharing: NAT64 requires a routing to be configured.  IPv6
   routing configuration requires receiving an IPv6 Router Advertisement
   [RFC4861].  Compared to currently-deployed NAT64 prefix discovery
   methods such as [RFC7050], including the NAT64 prefix in the Router
   Advertisement minimizes the number of packets required to configure a
   host.  This speeds up the process of connecting to a network that
   supports NAT64/DNS64, and simplifies host implementation by removing
   the possibility that the host can have an incomplete layer 3
   configuration (e.g., IPv6 addresses and prefixes, but no NAT64
   prefix).

   Deployability: all IPv6 hosts and networks are required to support
   [RFC4861].  Other options such as [RFC7225] require implementing
   other protocols.

3.  Semantics

   For simplicity, this option only supports a NAT64 prefix length of 96
   bits, as this is by the most common configuration used by hosts.
   Networks using one of the other prefix lengths supported in
   ([RFC6052]) can use other mechanisms such as [RFC7050] or [RFC7225].
   If different prefix lengths become common, another RA option can be
   created to configure them.

   This option may appear more than once in a Router Advertisement.
   Host behaviour with regards to synthesizing IPv6 addresses from IPv4
   addresses SHOULD follow the recommendations given in Section 3 of
   [RFC7050], limited to the NAT64 prefixes that have non-zero lifetime.

   This option specifies exactly one NAT64 prefix for all IPv4
   destinations.  If the network operator desires to route different
   parts of the IPv4 address space to different NAT64 devices, this can
   be accomplished by routing more specifics of the NAT64 prefix to
   those devices.  For example, if the operator would like to route
   10.0.0.0/8 through NAT64 device A and the rest of the IPv4 space
   through NAT64 device B, and the operator's NAT64 prefix is
   2001:db8:a:b::/96, then the operator can route
   2001:db8:a:b::a00:0/104 to NAT64 A and 2001:db8:a:b::/64 to NAT64 B.

   In a network that provides both IPv4 and NAT64, it may be desirable
   for certain IPv4 addresses not to be translated.  An example might be
   private address ranges that are local to the network and should not
   be reached through the NAT64.  This type of configuration cannot be
   conveyed to hosts using this option, or through other NAT64 prefix
   provisioning mechanisms such as [RFC7050] or [RFC7225].  This problem
   does not apply in IPv6-only networks, because in such networks, the

   host does not have an IPv4 address and cannot reach any IPv4
   destinations without the NAT64.

   Fields:

   Type     8-bit identifier of the RDNSS option type as assigned by
            IANA: TBD
   Length   8-bit unsigned integer.  The length of the option (including
            the Type and Length fields) is in units of 8 octets. The
            sender MUST set the Length to 2.  A host MUST ignore the
            NAT64 prefix option if the length field value is 1. If the
            Length field value exceeds 2, the host MUST utilize the

   Lifetime 16-bit unsigned integer.  The maximum time in seconds over
            which this NAT64 prefix MAY be used. The value of Lifetime
            SHOULD by default be set to lesser of  3 x MaxRtrAdvInterval
            or 65535 seconds.  A value of zero means that the prefix
            MUST no longer be used.

5.  Handling Multiple NAT64 Prefixes

   In some cases a host may receive multiple NAT64 prefixes from
   different sources.  Possible scenarios include (but are not limited
   to):

   o  the host is using multiple mechanisms to discover Pref64 prefixes
      (e.g. by using PCP ([RFC7225]) and/or by resolving IPv4-only fully




Colitti, et al.           Expires April 4, 2019                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft Discovering PREF64 in Router Advertisements  October 2018


      qualified domain name ([RFC7050]) in addition to receiving the
      Pref64 RA option);

   o  The pref64 option presents in a single RA more than once;

   o  the host receives multiple RAs with different Pref64 prefixes on
      one or multiple interfaces.

   When multiple Pref64 were discovered via RA Pref64 Option (the Option
   presents more than once in a singe RA or multiple RAs were received),
   host behaviour with regards to synthesizing IPv6 addresses from IPv4
   addresses SHOULD follow the recommendations given in Section 3 of
   [RFC7050], limited to the NAT64 prefixes that have non-zero
   lifetime..

   When different Pref64 are discovered by using multiple mechanisms,
   hosts SHOULD select one source of infromation only.  The RECOMMENDED
   order is:

   o  PCP-discovered prefixes ([RFC7225]), if supported;

   o  Pref64 discovered via RA Option;

   o  Pref64 resolving IPv4-only fully qualified domain name ([RFC7050])

   Note that if the network provides Pref64 both via this RA option and
   [RFC7225], hosts that receive the Pref64 via RA option may choose to
   use it imediately before waiting for PCP to complete, and therefore
   some traffic may not reflect any more detailed configuration provided
   by PCP.

6.  Multihoming

   Like most IPv6 configuration information, the Pref64 option is
   specific to the network on which it is received.  For example, a
   Pref64 option received on a particular wireless network may not be
   usable unless the traffic is also sourced on that network.
   Similarly, a host connected to a cellular network that povides NAT64
   generally cannot use that NAT64 for destinations reached through a
   VPN tunnel that terminates outside that network.

   Thus, correct use of this option on a multihomed host generally
   requires the host to be PVD-aware.

   This issue is not specific to the Pref64 RA option and, for example,
   is quite typical for DNS resolving on multihomed hosts (e.g. a host
   might resolve a destination name by using the corporate DNS server

   via the VPN tunnel but then send the traffic via its Internet-facing
   interface).

7.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to assign a new IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Option
   type for the PREF64 option defined in this document.

                         +---------------+-------+
                         | Option Name   | Type  |
                         +---------------+-------+
                         | PREF64 option | (TBD) |
                         +---------------+-------+

                                  Table 1

   The IANA registry for these options is:

      https://www.iana.org/assignments/icmpv6-parameters [1]

8.  Security Considerations

   Because Router Advertisements are required in all IPv6 configuration
   scenarios, on IPv6-only networks, Router Advertisements must already
   be secured, e.g., by deploying RA guard [RFC6105].  Providing all
   configuration in Router Advertisements increases security by ensuring
   that no other protocols can be abused by malicious attackers to
   provide hosts with invalid configuration.

   The security measures that must already be in place to ensure that
   Router Advertisements are only received from legitimate sources
   eliminate the problem of NAT64 prefix validation described in section
   3.1 of [RFC7050].
