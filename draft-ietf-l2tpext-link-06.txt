Abstract

   This document defines extensions to the Layer Two Tunneling Protocol
   (L2TP) for enhanced support of link-specific Point to Point Protocol
   (PPP) options. PPP endpoints typically have direct access to the
   common physical media connecting them and thus have detailed
   knowledge about the media that is in use. When the L2TP is used, the
   two PPP peers are no longer directly connected over the same physical
   media.  Instead, L2TP inserts a virtual connection over some or all
   of the PPP connection by tunneling PPP frames over a packet switched
   network such as IP.  Under some conditions, an L2TP endpoint may need

   to negotiate PPP Link Control Protocol (LCP) options at a location
   which may not have access to all of the media information necessary
   for proper participation in the LCP negotiation.  This document
   provides a mechanism for communicating desired LCP options between
   L2TP endpoints in advance of PPP LCP negotiation at the far end of an
   L2TP tunnel, as well as a mechanism for communicating the negotiated
   LCP options back to where the native PPP link resides.

1.0 Introduction

   L2TP [RFC2661] provides a very limited amount of guidance to the LNS
   as to what type of interface a tunneled PPP session arrived on at an
   LAC. Such information is limited to whether the interface was
   "synchronous" or "asynchronous", "digital" or "analog." These
   indications provide some guidance when negotiating PPP LCP at the
   LNS, but they are not as robust as they could be.

   This document defines a more robust way to inform the LAC of LCP
   negotiated options, and provides guidance to the LNS of the limits
   and values that the LAC requires during LCP negotiation. Deep
   knowledge of PPP [RFC1661] and L2TP [RFC2661] are expected for the
   remainder of this document.

   L2TP Proxy LCP allows options to be negotiated where the native PPP
   link resides, thus circumventing issues with ACCM, Alternate FCS, and
   other LCP Options that the LNS would not necessarily know how to
   properly negotiate without access to the physical media for the
   native PPP connection, interface type, or configuration. However, use
   of Proxy LCP introduces other problems as well as there are options
   within LCP PPP negotiation which should be set or adjusted by the
   LNS, such as the PPP Authentication Type and MRU. Finally, the PPP
   Client may reinitiate LCP negotiation at any time, and unless the LAC
   is sniffing every PPP data packet it forwards, would not be aware
   that this is even occurring.

   LCP options may be classified into roughly three different categories
   with respect to their affect on L2TP; (1) options which affect
   framing in a way that the LAC may need to know about or handle
   specifically (e.g., ALT-FCS, ACCM, MRU), (2) options that are mostly
   transparent to the LAC (e.g., AUTH-TYPE), and (3) options that the
   LAC may wish to influence because they are dependent on the media
   type (ACFC, PFC). We are most concerned about options which fall into

   category (1) and (3).

   This document defines new AVPs to allow the LAC and the LNS to
   communicate complete LCP information in order to react accordingly.
   LCP option information is structured in the same way as the Proxy LCP
   AVPs are in [RFC2661]. This essentially involves encapsulation of a
   PPP LCP Configure- Request or Configure-Ack packet within an L2TP
   AVP.

2.0 LCP Options From LAC to LNS

   The LAC may utilize the following AVPs within an ICCN or OCCN message
   in order to influence the LNS to negotiate LCP in a specific manner.
   If these AVPs are supported by the LNS, they should override any
   suggestions for LCP options implied by the Bearer Type or Framing
   Type AVPs.

   These AVPs may coexist with the Proxy LCP and Proxy Authentication
   AVPs (Proxy AVPs) defined in the base L2TP specification. If Proxy
   AVPs are received, the LNS may choose to accept these parameters, or
   renegotiate LCP with the options suggested by the AVPs defined in
   this document. If the LAC wishes to force negotiation of LCP by the
   LNS, it should simply omit all Proxy AVPs during call initialization.

   By default, the AVPs defined in this document are not mandatory (M-
   bit is set to zero). However, if an implementation needs to strongly
   enforce adherence to the options defined within the AVPs, it MAY set
   the M-bit to 1, thus forcing the peer to discontinue the session if
   it does not support this AVP. This is NOT recommended unless it is
   known that the result of operating without these extensions is
   completely unacceptable.

   If the AVPs in sections 2.1 and 2.2 are sent to the LNS, the LAC MUST
   be prepared to accept the AVPs as defined in section 2.3.

2.1 LCP Want Options (iccn, occn)

   The LCP Allow Options AVP, Attribute Type TBA1, contains a list of
   options that the LAC wants to be negotiated by the LNS.

   The Vendor ID is the IETF Vendor ID of 0.

   This AVP MAY be hidden (the H bit MAY be 0 or 1).

   The M bit for this AVP may be set to 0 or 1. If the sender of this
   AVP does not wish to establish a connection to a peer which does not
   understand this L2TP extension, it SHOULD set the M bit to 1,
   otherwise it MUST be set to 0.

   The Length (before hiding) of this AVP is 6 plus the length of the

   The LCP Configure-Req Value for this AVP is identical to the
   information field of a PPP LCP Configure-Req Packet (much like a
   Proxy LCP AVP in [RRFC2661]). It is sent from the LAC to the LNS, and
   is intended to guide PPP LCP negotiations at an LNS. In some cases,
   each individual PPP LCP option carried in this AVP maps to a desired
   value (e.g., MRU) and in some cases it maps to a specific option that
   is desired to be enabled (e.g., ACFC).  The LNS should use these
   suggestions when building its initial Configure-Request.

   The following chart defines some of the more common LCP options that
   may be included in this AVP with guidance of how to handle them at
   the LAC and LNS. This table is provided for some of the more common

   The AVP MAY be present in the following messages: ICCN, OCCN

   The LCP Configure-Ack Value for this AVP is identical to the
   information field of a PPP LCP Configure-Req Packet (much like a
   Proxy LCP AVP in [RRFC2661]). It is sent from the LAC to the LNS, and
   is intended to guide PPP LCP negotiations at an LNS. In some cases,
   each individual PPP LCP option carried in this AVP maps to a maximum
   value (e.g., MRU) and in others it maps to an option that is
   permitted by the LAC (e.g., ACFC). If the option is not included
   here, it can be assumed by the LNS that the LAC does not understand
   how to perform that particular option at the link layer (and would
   thus Configure-Reject that option). Information in this AVP should be
   utilized when building PPP Configure-Ack, Configure-Reject and
   Configure-Nak messages.

   The following chart defines some of the more common LCP options that
   may be included in this AVP with guidance of how to handle them at
   the LAC and LNS. This table is provided for illustration purposes for

                                               LNS SHOULD only accept

                                               present).

2.3 LCP Options From LNS to LAC

   In order to communicate negotiated LCP parameters from the LNS to the
   LAC, the format of two existing messages in [RFC2661] are used. These
   are:

     Last Sent LCP Confreq (IETF L2TP Attribute 27)
     Last Received LCP Confreq (IETF L2TP Attribute 28)

   These AVPs are sent from the LAC to the LNS to support Proxy LCP
   negotiation. In order to report negotiated LCP parameters from the
   LNS to the LAC, two messages of precisely the same format are
   defined:

     LNS Last Sent LCP Confreq (IETF L2TP Attribute TBA3)
     LNS Last Received LCP Confreq (IETF L2TP Attribute TBA4)

   When LCP negotiation is completed by the LNS, a Set-Link-Info control
   message MUST be sent with the these AVPs contained within.  These
   AVPs MUST contain the last sent and last received (with respect to
   the LNS) LCP packets.

   Rather than simply using the old Attribute values in the SLI Message,
   new AVP Attribute types are defined for these messages due to the
   fact that some existing L2TP implementations might check for what
   could seem like misplacement of known AVP types and generate a false
   error condition.

3.0 Security Considerations

   There are no known additional significant threats incurred by the
   mechanisms described in this document.

   This draft defines additional L2TP AVPs that identify link
   characteristics and interface information of a tunneled PPP link. If
   these values were snooped, a rogue individual may have access to more
   information about a given network or topology. Given that these same
   values may be negotiated over the tunneled link in PPP LCP packets
   anyway, this is no more information than is potentially transmitted
   today, it is just in a different form.

4.0 IANA Considerations

   This document requires four new L2TP "AVP Attribute" numbers to be
   assigned by IANA.

      TBA2, Section 2.2, LCP Allow Options
      TBA3, Section 2.3, LNS Last Sent LCP Confreq
