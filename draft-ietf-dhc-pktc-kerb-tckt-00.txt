   Abstract 
    
      This document defines a new sub-option for the CableLabs Client 
      Configuration (CCC) Option.  This new sub-option will be used to 
      direct CableLabs Client Devices (CCDs) to invalidate locally 
      persisted Kerberos tickets.

   3.   Introduction  
        
      The CableLabs Client Configuration Option [1] defines several sub-
      options used to configure devices deployed into CableLabs 
      architectures. These architectures employ the Kerberos protocol 
      [3] to support CCD authentication and establishment of security 
      associations between CCDs and application servers. 
       
      CCDs are permitted to locally persist Kerberos tickets. Thus a 
      power-cycled CCD is enabled to avoid expensive ticket acquisition 
      for locally persisted, non-expired tickets.  This feature greatly 
      reduces the Kerberos overhead of a deployment. 
       
      This sub-option allows the service provider to control the 
      lifetime of Kerberos tickets persisted locally on a CCD.  The 
      service provider requires this capability to support operational 
      functions such as disabling a subscriber's service, forcing re-
      establishment of security associations, or for testing and remote 
      diagnostic of CCDs.

   4.   Kerberos Ticket Control Sub-option 
    
      This sub-option defines a Ticket Control Mask (TCM) that 
      instructs the CCD to validate/invalidate specific application 
      server tickets.  The sub-option is encoded as follows:  
    
       Code   Len      TCM 
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+  
      | TBD |  2  | m1  | m2  | 
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+  
    
    
      The length MUST be 2.  The TCM field is encoded as an unsigned 16 
      bit quantity per network byte-ordering rules.  Each bit of the TCM 
      is assigned to a specific server or server group. A bit value of 0 
      means the CCD MUST NOT invalidate the locally persisted ticket for 
      the server/server group. A bit value of 1 means the CCD MUST 
      invalidate the locally persisted ticket for the server/server 
      group. 
       
      Bit #0 is the least significant bit of the field. The bit 
      positions are assigned as follows. 
       
         Bit #0 - the PacketCable Provisioning Server used by the CCD.  
          
         Bit #1 - the group of all PacketCable Call Management Servers 
         used by the CCD. 
          
         Bit #2 - #15. Reserved and MUST be set to 0. 
       
      If a CCD does not locally persist Kerberos tickets, it MUST 
      ignore this sub-option. 
    
   5.   IANA Considerations 
 
      IANA is requested to assign a sub-option code to this sub-option 
      from the "CableLabs Client Configuration" sub-option number space 
      (maintained within the BOOTP-DHCP Parameters Registry). 
    
   6.   Security Considerations  
        
      Potential DHCP protocol attack exposure is discussed in section 7 
      of the DHCP protocol specification [4] and in Authentication for 
      DHCP Messages [5].  Additional CCC attack exposure is discussed 
      in [1].

      The KTC sub-option could be used to disrupt a CableLabs 
      architecture deployment.  In the specific case of PacketCable 
      [6], a deployment could be disrupted if a large number of MTAs 
      are reset/power cycled, initiate their provisioning flow [7], and 
      are instructed by a malicious DHCP server to invalidate all 
      Kerberos tickets.  This could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) 
      condition as this large set of MTAs simultaneously attempt to 
      authenticate and obtain tickets from the Kerberos infrastructure. 
       
      However, the scenario described above is unlikely to occur.  
      Within the cable delivery architecture required by PacketCable 
      (and other CableLabs architectures), the DHCP client is connected 
      to a network through a cable modem and the CMTS (head-end). The 
      CMTS is explicitly configured with a set of DHCP servers to which 
      DHCP requests are forwarded.  Further, a correctly configured 
      CMTS will only allow downstream traffic from specific IP 
      addresses/ranges.
