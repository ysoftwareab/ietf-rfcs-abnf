          PCEP Extensions for Signaling Multipath Information
                    draft-koldychev-pce-multipath-00

Abstract

   This document introduces a mechanism to communicate multipath
   information in PCEP as a set of Explicit Route Objects (EROs).  A
   special object is defined to carry per ERO attributes.  This
   mechanism is applicable to SR-TE and RSVP-TE.

1.  Introduction

   Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP)
   [RFC5440] enables the communication between a Path Computation Client
   (PCC) and a Path Control Element (PCE), or between two PCEs based on
   the PCE architecture [RFC4655].

   PCEP Extensions for the Stateful PCE Model [RFC8231] describes a set
   of extensions to PCEP to enable active control of Multiprotocol Label
   Switching Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
   tunnels.  [RFC8281] describes the setup and teardown of PCE-initiated

   LSPs under the active stateful PCE model, without the need for local
   configuration on the PCC, thus allowing for dynamic centralized
   control of a network.

   PCEP Extensions for Segment Routing [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing]
   specifies extensions to the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP)

Internet-Draft        PCEP Extensions for Multipath         October 2019


   that allow a stateful PCE to compute and initiate Traffic Engineering
   (TE) paths, as well as a PCC to request a path subject to certain
   constraint(s) and optimization criteria in SR networks.

   Segment Routing Policy for Traffic Engineering
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] details the concepts of SR
   Policy and approaches to steering traffic into an SR Policy.  In
   particular, it describes the SR candidate-path as a collection of one
   or more Segment-Lists.  The current PCEP standards only allow for
   signaling of one Segment-List per Candidate-Path.  PCEP extension to
   support Segment Routing Policy Candidate Paths
   [I-D.barth-pce-segment-routing-policy-cp] specifically avoids
   defining how to signal multipath information, and states that this
   will be defined in another document (this one).

2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

2.1.  Terms and Abbreviations

   The following terms are used in this document:

   Endpoint:

      The IPv4 or IPv6 endpoint address of the SR policy in question, as
      described in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].

   PCEP Tunnel:

      The object identified by the PLSP-ID, as per
      [I-D.koldychev-pce-operational].

   Tunnel Instance:

      The object identified by the LSP-Identifiers TLV, as per
      [I-D.koldychev-pce-operational].

3.  Motivation

   This extension is motivated by the use-cases described below.

3.1.  Signaling Multiple Segment-Lists of an SR Candidate-Path

   The Candidate-Path of an SR Policy corresponds to a PCEP Tunnel, see
   [I-D.barth-pce-segment-routing-policy-cp].  Each Candidate-Path can
   contain multiple Segment-Lists and each Segment-List is encoded by
   one SR-ERO object.  However, each Tunnel Instance can contain only a
   single ERO object, which prevents us from encoding multiple Segment-
   Lists within the same SR Candidate-Path.

   With the help of the protocol extensions defined in this document,
   this limitation is overcome.

3.2.  Splitting of Requested Bandwidth

   A PCC may request a path with 100 Gbit of bandwidth, but all links in
   the network have only 50 Gbit capacity.  The PCE can return two
   paths, that can each carry 50 Gbit.  The PCC can then equally or
   unequally split the incoming 100 Gbit of traffic among the two 50
   Gbit paths.  Section 4.3 introduces a new TLV that carries the ERO
   path weight that allows distributing of incoming traffic on to the
   multiple ERO path(s).

3.3.  Providing Backup ERO for Protection

   It is desirable for the PCE to compute and signal to the PCC a backup
   ERO path that is used to protect a primary ERO path.  In this case,
   an indication specify a primary or backup.

   When multipath is used, a backup ERO path may protect one or more
   primary ERO path.  For this reason, a primary and backup path
   identifiers are needed to indicate which backup ERO path(s) protect
   which primary ERO path(s).  Section 4.4 introduces a new TLV that
   carries the required information.

4.  Protocol Extensions

4.1.  Multipath Capability TLV

   We define the MULTIPATH-CAP TLV that MAY be present in the OPEN
   object and/or the LSP object.  The purpose of this TLV is two-fold:

   1.  From PCC: it tells how many multipaths the PCC can install in
       forwarding.

   2.  From PCE: it tells that the PCE supports this standard and how
       many multipaths the PCE can compute.

   Only the first instance of this TLV can be processed, subsequent
   instances SHOULD be ignored.

   Number of Multipaths: the maximum number of multipaths that a PCE can
   return.  The value 0 indicates unlimited number.

   B-flag: whether MULTIPATH-BACKUP-TLV is supported.

   W-flag: whether MULTIPATH-WEIGHT-TLV is supported.

   Reserved: zero on transmit, ignore on receipt.

4.2.  ERO Attributes Object

   We define the ERO-ATTRIB object that is used to carry per-ERO
   information and to act as a separator between several ERO objects.
   The ERO-ATTRIB object always precedes the ERO that it applies to.  If
   multiple ERO objects are present, then each ERO object MUST be
   preceded by an ERO-ATTRIB object that describes it.

4.3.  Multipath Weight TLV

   We define the MULTIPATH-WEIGHT TLV that MAY be present in the
   ERO_ATTRIBUTES object.

      0                   1                   2                   3

                   Figure 3: MULTIPATH-WEIGHT TLV format

   Type: TBD2 for "MULTIPATH-WEIGHT" TLV.

   Length: 4.

   Weight: weight of this path within the multipath, if W-ECMP is
   desired.  The fraction of flows a specific ERO carries is derived
   from the ratio of its weight to the sum of all other multipath ERO
   weights.

4.4.  Multipath Backup TLV

   This document introduces a new MULTIPATH-BACKUP TLV that is optional
   and can be present in the ERO_ATTRIBUTES object.

   This TLV is used to indicate the presence of a backup ERO path that
   is used for protection in case of failure of the primary ERO path.
   The format of the MULTIPATH-BACKUP TLV is:

      0                   1                   2                   3

      P: If set, indicates the ERO is for a primary path

      B: If set, indicates the ERO is for a backup path

      F: If set, indicates this primary ERO is also protected.  The
      backup ERO Path ID indicates the ERO of the backup path.

   ERO Path ID: an identifier that identifies a primary path in the set
   of ERO(s)

   Backup ERO Path ID: an identifier that identifies the backup path ERO
   in the set of ERO(s)

5.  Operation

   When the PCC wants to indicate to the PCE that it wants to get
   multipaths instead of a single path, it can do one or both of the
   following:

   1.  Send the MULTIPATH-CAP TLV in the OPEN object during session
       establishment.  This applies to all PCEP Tunnels on the PCC,
       unless overridden by PCEP Tunnel specific information.

   2.  Send the MULTIPATH-CAP TLV in the LSP object for a particular
       PCEP Tunnel in the PCRpt message.  This applies to the specified
       PCEP Tunnel and overrides the information from the OPEN object.

   When PCE computes the path for a PCEP Tunnel, it MUST NOT return more
   multipaths than the corresponding value of "Number of Multipaths"
   from the MULTIPATH-CAP TLV.  If this TLV is absent (from both OPEN
   and LSP objects), then the "Number of Multipaths" is assumed to be 1.

   If the PCE supports this standard, then it MUST include the
   MULTIPATH-CAP TLV in the OPEN object.  This tells the PCC that it can
   report multiple ERO objects to this PCE.  If the PCE does not include
   the MULTIPATH-CAP TLV in the OPEN object, then the PCC MUST assume
   that the PCE does not support this standard and fall back to
   reporting only a single ERO.
