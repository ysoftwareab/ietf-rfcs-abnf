1.  Overview

   Network operators deploy Segment Routing (SR) [RFC8402] so they can
   forward packets through SR paths.  An SR path provides connectivity
   from its ingress node to its egress node.  While an SR path can
   follow the least-cost path from ingress to egress, it can also follow
   any other path.

   An SR path contains one or more segments.  A segment provides
   connectivity from its ingress node to its egress node.  It includes a
   topological instruction that controls its behavior.

   The topological instruction is executed on the segment ingress node.
   It determines the segment egress node and the method by which the
   segment ingress node sends packets to the segment egress node.

   SR nodes can also execute service instructions.  Segment egress nodes
   execute Per Segment Service Instructions (PSSI).  Likewise, path
   egress nodes execute Per Path Service Instructions (PPSI).
   (Section 2) of this document describes the relationship between SR
   paths, segments and instructions.

   A Segment Identifier (SID) identifies each segment.  Because there is
   a one-to-one relationship between segments and the topological
   instructions that control them, the SID that identifies a segment
   also identifies the topological instruction that controls it.

   A SID is shorter than the topological instruction that it identifies.
   While a SID is 16 or 32 bits long, the topological instruction that
   it identifies is at least 128 bits long.

   To forward a packet through an SR path, the SR ingress node encodes a
   list of SIDs in the packet header.  It can also encode service
   instructions in the packet header.

   Because the SR ingress node is also the first segment ingress node,
   it executes the first segment's topological instruction and sends the
   packet to the first segment egress node.  When the first segment
   egress node receives the packet, it executes the first segment's
   PSSI, if one is present.

   If the SR path contains only one segment, the first segment egress
   node is also the path egress node.  In this case, that node executes
   the PPSI, if one is present.

   If the SR path contains multiple segments, the first segment's egress
   node is also the second segment's ingress node.  In this case, that
   node executes the second segment's topological instruction.  This

   procedure continues until the packet arrives at the path egress node.
   If the packet includes a PPSI, the path egress node executes it.

   In SR, only the path ingress node maintains path information.  The
   segment ingress node maintains a topological instruction, but it does
   not maintain path information unless it is also a path ingress node.

   SR can use either an MPLS [RFC3031] data plane or an IPv6 [RFC8200]
   data plane.  SR-MPLS [RFC8660] uses MPLS.  SRv6
   [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming] uses IPv6.

   This document describes Segment Routing Mapped to IPv6 (SRm6).  SRm6
   is an SR solution that also uses IPv6.  It supports a wide variety of
   use-cases while adhering to IPv6 specifications.

   Section 8 of this document describes the differences between SRv6 and
   SRm6.

                Figure 1: Paths, Segments And Instructions

   Figure 1 depicts an SRm6 path.  The path provides connectivity from
   its ingress node (i.e., Node A) to its egress node (i.e., Node F).
   It contains Segments A-C, C-D and D-F.

   In Segment A-C, Node A is the ingress node, Node B is a transit node,
   and Node C is the egress node.  So, Node A executes the segment's
   topological instruction.  If the packet includes a PSSI for the
   segment, Node C executes it.

   In Segment C-D, Node C is the ingress node and Node D is the egress
   node.  So, Node C executes the segment's topological instruction.  If
   the packet includes a PSSI for the segment, Node D executes it.

   In Segment D-F, Node D is the ingress node, Node E is a transit node,
   and Node F is the egress node.  So, Node D executes the segment's
   topological instruction.  If the packet includes a PSSI for the
   segment, Node F executes it.

   Node F is also the path egress node.  So, if the packet includes a
   PPSI, Node F executes it.

   Other paths that are not included in the figure also include Segments
   A-C, C-D, and D-F.

3.  Topological Instructions

   SRm6 supports the following topological instruction types:

   o  Adjacency.

   o  Node.

   o  Binding.

3.1.  Adjacency Instructions

   Adjacency instructions send packets through a single link that
   connects the segment ingress node to the segment egress node.  An
   adjacency instruction includes the following information:

   o  SE-ADDR: The IPv6 address of an interface on the segment egress
      node.

   o  IFACE: An interface identifier.

   The instruction behaves as follows:

   o  If the interface identified by IFACE is not operational, discard
      the packet and send an ICMPv6 [RFC4443] Destination Unreachable
      message to the packet's source node.

   o  Overwrite the packet's Destination Address with SE-ADDR.

   o  Send the packet through the interface identified by IFACE.

3.2.  Node Instructions

   Node instructions send packets through the least-cost path from the
   segment ingress node to the segment egress node.  A node instruction
   includes an SE-ADDR.  The SE-ADDR is the IPv6 address of an interface
   on the segment egress node.

Internet-Draft                    SRm6                        April 2020


   The instruction behaves as follows:

   o  If the segment ingress node does not have a viable route to SE-
      ADDR, discard the packet and send an ICMPv6 Destination
      Unreachable message to the packet's source node.

   o  Overwrite the packet's Destination Address with SE-ADDR.

   o  Send the packet to the next-hop along the least-cost path to SE-
      ADDR.

3.3.  Binding Instructions

   Binding instructions send packets through tunnels that connect the
   segment ingress node to the segment egress node.  Because the tunnel
   is also an SRm6 path, it is called an SRm6 tunnel.

   A binding instruction includes the following information:

   o  SE-ADDR: The IPv6 address of an interface on the segment egress
      node.

   o  Tunnel-SID-List: A SID list that determines the path of the SRm6
      tunnel.

   The instruction behaves as follows:

   o  Overwrite the packet's Destination Address with SE-ADDR.

   o  Prepend an SRm6 tunnel header to the packet.  The SRm6 tunnel
      header includes the Tunnel-SID-List.

   o  If the SRm6 tunnel is not operational, discard the packet and send
      an ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable message to the packet's source
      node.

   o  Send the packet through the SRm6 tunnel.

4.  Service Instructions

   SRm6 supports the following service instruction types:

   o  Per-Segment Service Instructions (PSSI).

   o  Per-Path Service Instructions (PPSI).

Internet-Draft                    SRm6                        April 2020


4.1.  PSSI

   The PSSI, if present, is executed on the segment egress node.
   Because the path egress node is also a segment egress node, it can
   execute a PSSI.

   The following are examples of PSSIs:

   o  Expose a packet to a firewall policy.

   o  Expose a packet to a sampling policy.

4.2.  PPSI

   A PPSI, if present, is executed on the path egress node.

   The following are examples of PPSIs:

   o  De-encapsulate a packet and forward its newly exposed payload
      through a specified interface.

   o  De-encapsulate a packet and forward its newly exposed payload
      using a specified routing table.

5.  Segment Identifiers (SID)

   A Segment Identifier (SID) is an unsigned integer that identifies a
   segment.  It can be either 16 or 32 bits long.  Because there is a
   one-to-one relationship between segments and the topological
   instructions that control them, the SID that identifies a segment
   also identifies the topological instruction that controls it.

   A SID is shorter than the topological instruction that it identifies.
   While a SID is 16 or 32 bits long, the topological instruction that
   it identifies is at least 128 bits long.

   SIDs have node-local significance.  This means that a segment ingress
   node identifies each segment that it originates with a unique SID.
   However, a single SID value can be used to identify:

   o  A segment whose ingress is Node A and whose egress is Node Z.

   o  Another segment whose ingress is Node B and whose egress is also
      node Z.

   A single SID value can identify both segments because they originate
   on different nodes.

   SID values 0 through 15 are reserved for future use.

   SIDs can be assigned in a manner that simplifies network operations.
   See Section 5.2 for details.

5.1.  16-Bit SIDs Versus 32-Bit SIDs

   The maximum 16-bit SID value is 65,535.  Because SIDs 0 through 15
   are reserved for future use, a 16-bit SID offers 65,520 usable
   values.

   The maximum 32-bit SID value is 4,294,967,295.  Because SIDs 0
   through 15 are reserved for future use, a 32-bit SID offers
   4,294,967,280 usable values.

   To minimize packet length, network operators should use 16-bit SIDs
   whenever possible.  However, when more than 65,520 SIDs are required,
   network operators must use 32-bit SIDs.

   Consider a network that contains 60,000 nodes.  Each node connects to
   200 or fewer neighbors through point-to-point links.  In this
   network, we will determine how many SIDs are required under the
   following conditions:

   o  If the network contains adjacency segments only.

   o  If the network contains node segments only.

   o  If the network contains both adjacency and node segments.

   If the network contains adjacency segments only, and each node
   originates an adjacency segment to each of its neighbors, each node
   originates 200 segments or fewer.  Because SIDs have node-local
   significance (i.e., they can be reused across nodes), the network
   requires only 200 SIDs.  The network operator can use 16-bit SIDs, so
   long as each node supports 65,520 point-to-point links or fewer.

   If the network contains node segments only, and every node originates
   a node segment to every other node, every node originates 59,999
   segments.  Because SIDs have node-local significance, the network
   requires only 59,999 SIDs.  The network operator can use 16-bit SIDs
   so long as the number of nodes is less than 65,520.

   If the network contains both adjacency and node segments, each node
   will originate 60,199 segments or fewer.  This value is the sum of:

   o  The number of node segments that each node originates (i.e.,
      59,999).

Internet-Draft                    SRm6                        April 2020


   o  The number of adjacency segments that each node originates (i.e.,
      200 or fewer).

   Because SIDs have node-local significance, only 60,199 SIDs are
   required.  The network operator can use 16-bit SIDs so long as the
   number of nodes plus the maximum number of links per node is less
   than 65,520.

5.2.  Assigning SIDs

   Network operators can establish conventions for assigning SIDs to
   segments.  These conventions can simplify network operations.

   For example, a network operator who uses 16-bit SIDs can:

   o  Assign SIDs 16 - 1000 to adjacency segments

   o  Assign SIDs 1001 - 62,000 to node segments

   o  Assign SIDs 62,001 to 65,535 to binding segments

   The network operator can also assign node SIDs so that all node
   segments ending on a node have the same SID (i.e., all node
   instructions that include the same information are identified by the
   same SID).

           |          2           |          1          | 1001 |
           |          3           |          1          | 1001 |

           |          3           |          2          | 1002 |
           |          1           |          3          | 1003 |
           |          2           |          3          | 1003 |

                       Figure 2: SRm6 Path As Tunnel

   SRm6 is an application of IPv6 tunneling [RFC2473].  Figure 2
   illustrates how an SRm6 ingress node receives an original packet,
   encapsulates it in an SRm6 header, and forwards the resulting SRm6
   packet through an SRm6 path to an SRm6 egress node.  The SRm6 egress
   node removes the SRm6 header and forwards the original packet to its
   destination.

                       Figure 3: SRm6 Encapsulation

   Figure 3 illustrates SRm6 encapsulation.  In the figure, the SRm6
   header contains:

   o  An IPv6 header.

   o  One or more IPv6 extension headers.

Internet-Draft                    SRm6                        April 2020


   The following rules govern the use of extension headers in the SRm6
   header:

   o  The SRm6 header can contain any valid combination of extension
      headers.

   o  Extension headers are arranged in the order recommended by
      Section 4.1 of [RFC8200].

   o  Extension headers are processed in the order that the appear in
      the packet, as described in Section 4.1 of [RFC8200].

   o  If the SR path contains multiple segments, the SID list is encoded
      in a Compressed Routing Header (CRH)
      [I-D.bonica-6man-comp-rtg-hdr].

   o  If the SRm6 header contains a PSSI, it is encoded in a Destination
      Option header that precedes the CRH.  Destination options will be
      defined as needed.

   o  If the SRm6 header contains a PPSI, it is encoded in the IPv6
      Tunnel Payload Forwarding (TPF) Option
      [I-D.bonica-6man-vpn-dest-opt].  The TPF option appears in a
      Destination Options header that immediately precedes the upper-
      layer header.

   Therefore, PSSI's are processed at each segment egress node, while
   the PPSI is processed at the path egress node only.

   An SRm6 header contains only the extension headers that it needs.
   For example, an SRm6 header can contain:

   o  A CRH and a TPF Option - This packet traverses an SRm6 path that
      contains multiple segments and executes a PPSI at the path egress
      node.

   o  A CRH only - This packet traverses an SRm6 path that contains
      multiple segments and does not execute a PPSI at the path egress
      node.

   o  A TPF Option only - This packet traverses an SRm6 path that
      contains a single segment and executes a PPSI at the path egress
      node.

   SRm6 inherits Hop Limit, traffic class and Flow Label processing
   procedures from I [RFC2473].

7.  Control Plane

   The following documents describe control plane extensions that
   support the CRH and the TPF Option:

   o  IS-IS Support for CRH [I-D.bonica-lsr-crh-isis-extensions]

   o  BGP Support for the IPv6 TPF Option
      [I-D.ssangli-idr-bgp-vpn-srv6-plus],
      [I-D.alston-spring-crh-bgp-signalling]

8.  Differences Between SRm6 and SRv6

8.1.  Instruction Encoding

   SRm6 encodes topological instructions in 16 or 32-bit SIDs that
   appear in the CRH.  It also encodes service instructions in IPv6
   Destination Options.

   SRv6 encodes all instructions in the low-order bits of the IPv6
   Destination Address.

8.2.  IPv6 Address Semantics

   In SRm6 an IPv6 address always represents a network interface, as per
   [RFC4291].

   In SRv6, an IPv6 Destination Address can represent either of the
   following:

   o  A network interface

   o  An SRv6 SID, whose high-order bits are used for routing and low-
      order bits represent an instruction.

8.3.  OAM

   SRm6 does not require any new OAM mechanisms.  Because SRv6 modifies
   IPv6 address semantics, it requires the OAM mechanisms described in
   [I-D.ietf-6man-spring-srv6-oam].

     Table 2: Routing Header Size (in Bytes) As A Function Of Routing
                      Header Type and Number Of SIDs

   SRv6 and SRm6 both encode path information in a Routing extension
   header.  SRv6 uses the Segment Routing Header (SRH) [RFC8754], while
   SRm6 uses either the 16 or 32-bit version of the CRH.  (Table 2)
   reports Routing header size as a function of Routing header type and
   number of SIDs contained by the Routing header.  Due to their
   relative immaturity,
   [I-D.filsfils-spring-net-pgm-extension-srv6-usid],
   [I-D.li-spring-compressed-srv6-np] and
   [I-D.mirsky-6man-unified-id-sr] are omitted from this analysis.

   Large Routing headers are undesirable for the following reasons:

   o  Many ASIC-based forwarders copy all headers from buffer memory to
      on-chip memory.  As header sizes increase, so does the cost of
      this copy.

   o  Because Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) [RFC8201] is not entirely
      reliable, many IPv6 hosts refrain from sending packets larger than
      the IPv6 minimum link MTU (i.e., 1280 bytes).  When packets are
      small, the overhead imposed by large Routing Headers is excessive.

8.5.  Authentication

   An SRm6 packet can include any valid combination of IPv6 extension
   headers.  However, the IPv6 Authentication Header (AH) [RFC4302] is
   not defined in SRv6.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not request any actions by IANA.

10.  Security Considerations

   SRm6 inherits the security consideration of IPv6 tunneling [RFC2473],
   the Compressed Routing Header (CRH) [I-D.bonica-6man-comp-rtg-hdr],
   and the IPv6 Tunnel Payload Forwarding (TPF) Option
   [I-D.bonica-6man-vpn-dest-opt].
