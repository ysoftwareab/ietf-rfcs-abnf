Internet-Draft           URN Namespace for NATO             September 2014

Abstract

   This document describes a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace
   primarily for uniquely identifying Extensible Markup Language (XML)
   artifacts that provide information about NATO message text formats
   and service specifications as described in various NATO standards
   [4], instructions and publications.

1. Introduction

   Historically, NATO has used standardized character-oriented message
   text formats (MTF) to interoperate, report and exchange information
   both among its commands and with national entities, commercial
   partners and NGOs.  These MTFs are generated using the NATO Message
   Text Formatting System (FORMETS) in accordance with the rules,
   constructions and vocabulary specified within the Allied Data
   Publication Number 3 (ADatP-3).  Almost 400 NATO-defined messages
   that conform to ADatP-3 are contained in an Allied Procedural
   Publication Number 11 (APP-11) message catalogue.

Internet-Draft           URN Namespace for NATO             September 2014


   Prior to 2008 these messages were only available as slash delimited
   textual messages. Since 2008, the APP-11 message catalogue (expresses
   message definitions) also includes XML-MTF definitions for these
   messages, giving rise to a need to define and manage a URN namespace
   rooted in the "nato" NID.

2. Specification Template

2.1. Namespace ID:

   The Namespace ID "nato" is requested.

2.2. Registration Information:

   Version 1

   Date: 2014-09-11

2.3. Declared Registrant of the Namespace:

   Registering Organization:

   North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)

   Communications & Information Services Agency (NCIA)

   Address: SHAPE, 7010, Belgium

   Declared Contact:

   Role: NATO Naming and Addressing Authority (NRA)

   Email: nra@ncia.nato.int

2.4. Declaration of Syntactic Structure:

   The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the "nato"
   NID shall have the following structure:

   urn:nato:<Type>:<Source>

   The "Type" is a required US-ASCII string that conforms to the URN
   syntax requirements (see RFC 2141 [1]) and defines a particular
   category or type of named resources, such as "mtf"





Murdock                  Expires Mar 11, 2014                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft           URN Namespace for NATO             September 2014


   The "Source" is an optional US-ASCII string that conforms to the URN
   syntax requirements (see RFC 2141 [1]) and defines a particular
   standard, catalogue or other source of relevant specifications

   The NATO Naming and Registration Authority (NRA) functions as a Local
   Internet Registry under RIPE NCC and will also serve as the
   responsible registrar for managing the assignments of both "Type" and
   "Source" strings. The NRA may also assign URNs in sub-trees below the
   level of the Type or Source as needed. They will also ensure a
   registry of the resulting namespace is maintained.

2.5. Relevant Ancillary Documentation:

   APP-11 - the ADatP-3 message catalogue

   AdatP-3 - The message text format standard promulgated under STANAG
   5500 ed. 7

   The interim NATO Metadata Registry and Repository (NMRR) webpage can
   be found at https://nmrr.ncia.nato.int/home.htm

2.6. Identifier Uniqueness Considerations:

   The NRA, as registrar, shall directly assure the global uniqueness of
   the assigned strings. Though responsibility for administration of
   sub-trees may be delegated, these shall not be published to the
   registry or be requested to be resolved by any URN resolver until the
   uniqueness of the resulting urn:nato namespace has been validated
   against the existing contents of the registry. URN identifiers shall
   be assigned to at most one resource and not reassigned.

2.7. Identifier Persistence Considerations:

   The Registrar may assign URNs in sub-trees below the level of Type or
   Standard, but once registered, URNs shall not be re-assigned. Within
   the registry, their status as active or archive shall be recorded.

2.8. Process of Identifier Assignment:

   A namespace specific string within the NATO namespace will only be
   assigned upon advancement of a relevant specification. The Registrar
   checks all requested identifiers against the existing registrations
   within urn:nato to ensure uniqueness and encourage relevance. At this
   time, the possibility of delegating registration activities for the
   sub-tree is evaluated, subject to supporting agreements. Otherwise,
   such responsibilities remain with the NRA as overarching Registrar.
   The urn is then registered with appropriate metadata and an

   authorized request for URN resolution can be initiated (if
   necessary).

2.9. Process for Identifier Resolution:

   The namespace is not currently listed with a Resolution Discovery
   System (RDS) [3]. In the future, URNs from this namespace may be                                                          rd        resolved using a NATO listing in an RDS, using a 3  party listed
   resolver, using an unlisted, private resolver, or some combination of
   these.  The resolution method for each sub-tree will be registered
   with the NRA Registrar.

2.10. Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

   No special considerations.  The rules for lexical equivalence
   specified in RFC 2141 apply.

2.11. Conformance with URN Syntax:

   No special considerations.

2.12. Validation Mechanism:

   None specified. It will be conducted as part of the application for
   identifier registration as indicated in preceding paragraphs.

2.13. Scope:

   Global.

3. Namespace Considerations

   In addition to the large number of XML message specifications that
   now exist in APP-11, there are other existing and emerging NATO
   standard messages expressed as XML, as well as ongoing Web service
   specification development.  With no single NID registered to NATO,
   some of these specifications may be established within locally
   relevant, self-generated URN namespaces.  Not only does this inhibit
   the portability and adoption intended by standards development [4],
   it risks name collisions when exposed to the global context of the
   federation of partners for which these messages are destined.

   The use of Uniform Resource Names with an appropriate Namespace ID
   will enable the various NATO standards committees and working groups
   [5] to use unique, relevant, reliable, permanent, managed and
   accessible namespace names for its XML products. It also provides

Internet-Draft           URN Namespace for NATO             September 2014


   NATO the opportunity to leverage the use of URNs for persistent
   naming of non-XML resources.

4. Community Considerations

   The NATO standards development community, and those implementing such
   standards, will benefit from publication of this namespace by having
   more permanent and reliable names for the XML namespaces defined
   within STANAGs, the MTF catalogue (APP-11) and other published
   standards [4].

   Though these are NATO-published standards [4], they represent the
   consensus of multi-national working groups, are implemented in
   commercial products and used by partners within the international
   community.

   In the case of MTF standards [5], the responsibility for its
   development and maintenance belongs to the NATO C3 Board's Message
   Text Formats (MFT) Capability Team [5].  This team is "open to all
   recognized NATO Partners around the Globe in principle. The term
   'Partners around the Globe' summarizes all partners that are listed
   on the NATO webpage: Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC), NATO's
   Mediterranean Dialogue (MD), Istanbul Cooperation Initiative (ICI)
   and Partners across the globe" [AC/322-N(2014)0091-AS1].



5. Security Considerations

   This document introduces no additional security considerations beyond
   those associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.

   Distribution of NATO information in any form is subject to its
   security policies.

6. IANA Considerations

   This document defines a URN NID registration of "nato", which is
   requested to be entered into the IANA registry located at
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces>.

7. Conclusions

   It is necessary that a standards body, like NATO, ensures its
   messages, service specifications and other XML artifacts are based in
   namespaces that can be described using unique, persistent and managed
   URNs.  Considering its role as an information broker between many

   disparate communities, this document recommends a formal namespace
   identifier (NID) urn:nato for Uniform Resource Names (URN) associated
   with NATO information products.
