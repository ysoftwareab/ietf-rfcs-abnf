  readability.

  Protocol elements are described using ASN.1 [X.680].  The term
  "BER-encoded" means the element is to be encoded using the Basic
  Encoding Rules [X.690] under the restrictions detailed in Section 5.1
  of [RFC2251].

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

  document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].


1. Introduction

  This document provides a general mechanism for grouping related LDAP
  [LDAPTS] operations.  Grouping of operations can be used to support
  replication, proxies, and high level operations such as transactions.

  This document describes a set of LDAP extended operations [RFC2251]
  and other protocol and schema elements to support grouping of related
  operations.  Uses of this grouping mechanism will be detailed in
  separate documents (e.g., LDAP Transactions [TRANSGRP], LDAP Proxy
  Group [PROXYGRP]).

  A group of operations is defined as a set of operations within a
  common session identified by a unique cookie.  All requests which are
  initiated with the same cookie belong to the same grouping.  The
  cookie is obtained using the create group operation and is normally
  valid until the end group operation is completed.  A group can be
  ended prematurely as described below.

  Operations can be intermixed regardless of their grouping (or lack of
  grouping).  Groups can be nested.

  Each group is of a particular type specified when the group is
  created.  This type defines the semantics of the group.


2. Protocol Elements

  This document describes three extended operations, two unsolicited
  notification, and one control.  Extended operations and controls are
  described by LDAP [RFC2251] and provide here for convenience:

      criticality    BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
      controlValue   OCTET STRING OPTIONAL
    }

  Editor's Note:
    The object identifiers appearing in this draft are fictious.  The
    top-level OID 1.1 is be replaced before this draft is published as
    an RFC.


2.1 Common Protocol Elements

    groupCookie :== OCTET STRING

  A groupCookie is an octet string used to uniquely identify a grouping
  of related operations within the session.  A groupCookie is a
  notational convenience.


2.2 Create Grouping Operation

  The Create Grouping extended operation is used to create or start a
  grouping of related operations.  The operation consists of the
  createGroupingRequest and the createGroupingResponse.  The object
  identifier createGroupingOID identifies this operation and SHOULD be
  listed as a value of supportedExtension in the root DSE of servers
  which support this operation.

    createGroupingOID ::= "1.1.1"


2.2.1 createGroupingRequest

  The client initiates this operation by sending a
  createGroupingRequest.  This request is an ExtendedRequest where the

INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-zeilenga-ldap-grouping-04        28 June 2002


  requestName is the object identifier createGroupOID and requestValue
  is BER-encoded createGroupingRequestValue:

    createGroupingRequestValue ::= SEQUENCE {
      createGroupType     [0] LDAPOID,
      createGroupValue    [1] OCTET STRING OPTIONAL
    }

  where createGroupType is an object identifier that describes the
  specific type of grouping and createGroupValue contains a type
  specific payload.


2.2.2 createGroupingResponse

  The createGroupingResponse is sent in response to a
  createGroupingRequest.  This response is an ExtendedResponse where the
  responseName MUST be the value of the requestName provided in the
  request and the response is a BER-encoded createGroupingResponseValue:

    createGroupingResponseValue ::= SEQUENCE {
      createGroupCookie [0] groupCookie OPTIONAL,
      createGroupValue  [1] OCTET STRING OPTIONAL
    }

  where createGroupCookie, if present, is a cookie uniquely identifying
  the new grouping and createGroupValue is a type specific payload.  The
  createGroupCookie only when the operation results in the creation of a
  group.  Otherwise, it is absent.


2.3 End Grouping Operation

  The End Grouping extended operation is used to end or stop a grouping
  of related operations.  The operation consists of the
  endGroupingRequest and the endGroupingResponse.  The object identifier
  endGroupingOID identifies this operation and SHOULD be listed as a
  value of supportedExtension in the root DSE of servers which support
  this operation.

    endGroupingOID ::= "1.1.2"


2.3.1 endGroupingRequest

  The client initiates this operation by sending an endGroupingRequest.
  This request is an ExtendedRequest where the requestName is the object
  identifier endGroupOID and requestValue is BER-encoded



Zeilenga                      LDAP Grouping                     [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-zeilenga-ldap-grouping-04        28 June 2002


  endGroupingRequestValue:

    endGroupingRequestValue ::= SEQUENCE {
      endGroupCookie  [0] groupCookie,
      endGroupValue   [1] OCTET STRING OPTIONAL
    }

  where endGroupCookie is a cookie identifying the grouping and
  endGroupValue contains a type specific payload.


2.3.2 endGroupingResponse

  The endGroupingResponse is sent in response to a endGroupingRequest.
  This response is an ExtendedResponse where the responseName MUST be
  the value of the requestName provided in request and the response is a
  BER-encoded endGroupingResponseValue:

    endGroupingResponseValue ::= SEQUENCE {
      endGroupValue  [1] OCTET STRING OPTIONAL
    }

  where endGroupValue is a type specific payload.


2.4 endGroupingNotice

  The endGroupingNotice is an LDAP unsolicited notification.  The
  notification may be sent to the client to end a grouping which the
  server is unable or unwilling to continue to process.  The notice is
  an extendedResponse where the responseName is the object identifier
  endGroupingNoticeOID and the response is a BER-encoded
  endGroupingNoticeValue:

    endGroupingNoticeOID ::= "1.1.4"

    endGroupingNoticeValue ::= SEQUENCE {
      endGroupingCookie [0] groupCookie,
      endGroupValue     [1] OCTET STRING OPTIONAL
    }

  where endGroupingCookie is a cookie uniquely identifying the grouping
  and endGroupValue contains a type specific payload.


2.5 Actions Grouping Operation

  The Actions Grouping extended operation is used to take actions



Zeilenga                      LDAP Grouping                     [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-zeilenga-ldap-grouping-04        28 June 2002


  effecting a grouping of related operations.  The operation consists of
  the actionsGroupingRequest and the actionsGroupingResponse.  The
  object identifier actionsGroupingOID identifies this operation and
  SHOULD be listed as a value of supportedExtension in the root DSE of
  servers which support this operation.

    actionsGroupingOID ::= "1.1.5"


2.5.1 actionsGroupingRequest

  The client initiates this operation by sending an
  actionsGroupingRequest.  This request is an ExtendedRequest where the
  requestName is the object identifier actionsGroupOID and requestValue
  is BER-encoded actionsGroupingRequestValue:

    actionsGroupingRequestValue ::= SEQUENCE {
      actionsGroupCookie   [0] groupCookie,
      actionsGroupValue    [1] OCTET STRING OPTIONAL
    }

  where actionsGroupCookie is a cookie identifying the grouping and
  actionsGroupValue contains a type specific payload.


2.5.2 actionsGroupingResponse

  The actionsGroupingResponse is sent in response to a
  actionsGroupingRequest.  This response is an ExtendedResponse where
  the responseName MUST be the value of the requestName provided in
  request and the response is a BER-encoded
  actionsGroupingResponseValue:

    actionsGroupingResponseValue ::= SEQUENCE {
      actionsGroupValue  [1] OCTET STRING OPTIONAL
    }

  where actionsGroupValue is a type specific payload.


2.6 infoGroupingNotice

  The infoGroupingNotice is an LDAP unsolicited notification.  The
  notice may be sent to the client to provide additional grouping type
  specific information.  The notice is an extendedResponse where the
  responseName is the object identifier infoGroupingNoticeOID and the
  response is a BER-encoded infoGroupingNoticeValue:




Zeilenga                      LDAP Grouping                     [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-zeilenga-ldap-grouping-04        28 June 2002


    infoGroupingNoticeOID ::= "1.1.6"

    infoGroupingNoticeValue ::= SEQUENCE {
      infoGroupingCookie [0] groupCookie,
      infoGroupValue     [1] OCTET STRING OPTIONAL
    }

  where infoGroupingCookie is a cookie uniquely identifying the grouping
  and infoGroupValue contains a type specific payload.


2.7 groupingControl

  The groupingControl is used to identify requests and responses as
  belonging to a grouping of operations.  The groupingControl is a
  Control where the controlType is the object identifier
  groupingControlOID and the criticalValue is a BER-encoded
  groupingControlValue:

    groupingControlOID ::= "1.1.7"

    groupingControlValue ::= SEQUENCE {
      groupingCookie   [0] groupCookie,
      groupValue       [1] OCTET STRING OPTIONAL
    }

  where groupingCookie is a cookie uniquely identifying the grouping,
  the criticality field is TRUE, and groupingValue contains a type
  specific payload.

  The value groupingControlOID SHOULD be listed as a value of
  supportedControl in the root DSE by servers which support this
  control.

  The control SHALL NOT appear multiple times in the same LDAP PDU.  If
  multiple occurrences of the control are detected, the PDU SHALL be
  treated as a protocol error.


3. Schema Elements

  The document describes one attribute type.


3.1. supportedGroupingTypes

  Servers SHOULD publish grouping types they support listing group type
  object identifiers as values of the supportedGroupingTypes attribute



Zeilenga                      LDAP Grouping                     [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-zeilenga-ldap-grouping-04        28 June 2002


  type in the root DSE.  The supportedGroupingTypes attribute type is
  defined as:

    ( 1.1.5 NAME 'supportedGroupingTypes'
      DESC 'supported types of groupings of operations'
      EQUALITY objectIdentifierMatch
      SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.38      USAGE dSAOperation )

  The objectIdentifierMatch and OBJECT IDENTIFIER
  (1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.38) are defined in [RFC2252].

  Servers MUST be capable of recognizing this attribute type by the name
  'supportedGroupingTypes'.  Servers MAY recognize the attribute type by
  other names.


4. Operational Semantics

  This section details the common semantics of groups of related
  operations.   Additional semantics may be associated with each
  grouping type as described by other documents.


4.1 Grouping Semantics

  This subsection details semantics of the protocol elements introduced
  in Section 2.


4.1.1 Create Grouping

  To group related operations, the client MUST request a groupCookie
  from the server by sending a createGroupingRequest as described in
  Section 2.2.1.  The client SHALL provide type specific payload in
  createGroupValue if so required by the grouping type.

  The server SHALL respond with a createGroupingResponse as described in
  Section 2.2.2.  If the server is willing and able to create the
  grouping as requested (and per type requirements), it SHALL respond
  with success, provide a session-unique groupCookie and, if
  appropriate, a type specific payload.  Otherwise the server SHALL
  respond with a non-successful response containing no groupCookie, but
  MAY, if appropriate, provide a type specific payload.


4.1.2 End Grouping

  When the client wishes to end the grouping, the client SHALL send a



Zeilenga                      LDAP Grouping                     [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-zeilenga-ldap-grouping-04        28 June 2002


  endGroupingRequest as described in Section 2.3.1.  The client SHALL
  provide the groupCookie of the grouping to be ended and MAY provided a
  type specific payload.  If the grouping to be ended contained active
  nested groupings, these are implicitly ended as well without notice.
  The server SHALL respond with an endGroupingResponse as described in
  Section 2.3.2.


4.1.3 End Group Notice

  The server MAY end a group without solicitation for any reason.  The
  server SHALL notify the client of this action by sending a endGrouping
  Notice, as described in Section 2.4.  The server SHALL provide the
  groupCookie of the group it terminated and MAY provide a type specific
  payload.  The notice SHALL have a non-success resultCode.

  If the group contains nested groups, the nested groups are implicitly
  ended as well without additional notice.


4.1.4 Actions Grouping

  To perform an action within a group of related operations, the client
  sends to the server actionsGroupingRequest as described in Section
  2.5.1.  The client SHALL provide the groupCookie of the group the
  operation is requested upon and, if required by the grouping type, a
  type specific payload.

  The server SHALL respond with a actionsGroupingResponse as described
  in Section 2.5.2.  The server SHALL, if required by the grouping type,
  provide type specific payload.


4.1.5 Info Grouping Notice

  As allowed by the grouping type, the server MAY provide to the client
  a notice regarding the grouping of related operations in an
  infoGroupingNotice as described in Section 2.6.   The server SHALL, if
  required by the grouping type, provide type specific payload.


4.2 Nested groupings

  Groups of the same or different types MAY be nested.  A nested group
  is instantiated by providing a groupingControl containing the parent
  group's cookie with the createGroupingRequest.

  Group type specifications MAY restrict the types of groupings which



Zeilenga                      LDAP Grouping                     [Page 9]

INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-zeilenga-ldap-grouping-04        28 June 2002


  may be nested.  Servers MAY also place additional restrictions upon
  nesting.  Clients SHOULD NOT assume support for arbitrary nesting.


4.3 Intermixing of unrelated operations

  LDAP is designed to allow clients to perform unrelated tasks
  concurrently.  In keeping with this design, operations which unrelated
  to the grouping are generally allowed be intermixed with grouped
  operations.  (See Section 4.5 for specific exceptions to this general
  rule.)  It is noted that undue restrictions often unrelated operation
  cause unnecessary serialization of independent tasks, place
  unnecessary burden upon implementors, and can limit extensibility.

  Group type specifications SHOULD NOT disallow unrelated operations
  from being intermixed with grouped operations.

  Note: a grouping which disallows unrelated from being intermixed with
  grouped operation can be viewed as providing "framing" semantics.


4.4 Grouped operations

  Interrogation (compare, search) and update (add, delete, modify,
  rename) MAY be grouped.  Certain extended operations MAY also be
  grouped, but those which affect the session as a whole, such as Start
  TLS, MUST NOT be grouped.

  Requests and Responses associated with grouped operations contain a
  groupingControl control as described in Section 2.7.

  Group type specifications MAY restrict the kind and/or number of
  operations which may be related.  Servers MAY place additional
  restrictions upon groupings.  Clients SHOULD NOT assume support for
  arbitrary grouping.


4.5 Other Operations

  Upon issuing any grouping operation, the semantics of following
  operations listed is modified as described below.


4.5.1 abandon

  The abandon operation SHOULD NOT be used to cancel grouped operations.
  The Cancel operation is to be used instead (as discussed in 4.5.3).




Zeilenga                      LDAP Grouping                    [Page 10]

INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-zeilenga-ldap-grouping-04        28 June 2002


4.5.2 bind

  The client SHOULD end all outstanding groupings before issuing a bind
  request.  The server SHALL, in addition to the LDAPv3 behavior
  [RFC2251][RFC2829], abandon all outstanding groups.  No
  endGroupingNotice notification is sent upon such abandonment.

  A Bind operation cannot be related to other operations using this
  grouping mechanism.  The bind messages SHOULD NOT contain
  groupingControl controls and, if present, SHALL be treated as a a
  protocol error.


4.5.3 cancel

  The cancel operation [CANCEL] MAY be used to cancel grouped operations
  but SHOULD NOT contain a groupingControl control unless the group type
  calls for a type specific payload to be provided.  The groupingCookie
  in the provided groupingControl control MUST be the same associated
  with the operation to be canceled, otherwise the cancel request SHALL
  be treated as an error.


4.5.4 Start TLS

  The client SHOULD end all outstanding groupings before issuing a Start
  TLS [RFC2930] request.  If there are any outstanding groupings, the
  server MUST return operationsError in response to a StartTLS request.
  Start TLS operation cannot be related to other operations using this
  grouping mechanism and the Start TLS request and response PDUs SHALL
  NOT contain a groupingControl control.


4.5.5 unbind

  The server SHALL, in addition to the LDAPv3 behavior [RFC2251],
  abandon all outstanding groups.  No endGroupingNotice is sent upon
  such abandonment.  An unbind operation cannot be related to other
  operations using this grouping mechanism.  The unbind request SHOULD
  NOT contain a groupingControl control and, if present, SHALL be
  ignored.


5. Profiling Requirements

  Documents detailing extensions using the grouping mechanism MUST
  provide a profile of its use of the mechanism.




Zeilenga                      LDAP Grouping                    [Page 11]

INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-zeilenga-ldap-grouping-04        28 June 2002


  The profile SHALL specify the object identifier to be used to uniquely
  identify each grouping type it defines.  Object identifiers used to
  identity group types, like other protocol elements, SHALL be delegated
  in accordance with [LDAPIANA].

  The profile SHALL state which protocol elements of the mechanism it
  uses.

  Each of the grouping protocol elements defined in this document allow
  transfer of type specific payloads.  For each protocol element used,
  the profile SHALL state whether the element is to carry a type
  specific payload or not and SHALL fully describe the syntax and
  semantics associated with each type specific payload.

  The profile MAY define grouping type specific semantics which place
  further restrictions upon the grouping related operations.


6. Security Considerations

  This mechanism can be used to support complex groupings of related
  operations.  With such complexity comes inherit risk.  Specifications
  of uses of this mechanism should take special care to address security
  issues.  In particular, denial of service and authentication,
  authorization, and access-control issues should be addressed in
  documents detailing uses of this grouping mechanism.


7. IANA Considerations

  It is requested that IANA register upon Standards Action the LDAP
  'supportedGroupingTypes' descriptor.  The following registration
  template is suggested:

      Subject: Request for LDAP Descriptor Registration
      Descriptor (short name): supportedGroupingTypes
      Object Identifier: TBD
      Person & email address to contact for further information:
          Kurt Zeilenga <kurt@OpenLDAP.org>
      Usage: Attribute Type
      Specification: RFCXXXX
      Author/Change Controller: IESG

  This OID was assigned [ASSIGN] by OpenLDAP Foundation, under its IANA-
  assigned private enterprise allocation [PRIVATE], for use in this
  specification.
