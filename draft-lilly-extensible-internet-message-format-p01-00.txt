Abstract

   The Internet Message Format originally formally specified in RFC 561
   has been extended in some ways and for some purposes which have posed
   difficulties for some desirable operations such as digitally signed
   messages, have led to clutter in message content which in turn has
   led user agent implementers to suppress display of some originator
   message content, leading in some cases to user confusion, surprise,
   and embarrassment.  This memo is part of a multi-document series that
   specifies an extensible message format which is intended to
   facilitate operations hampered by extensions to the current format
   and to reduce clutter in the user-to-user message content.  This memo
   will present a brief history of the Internet Message Format
   evolution, will identify problems caused by changes that have been
   made, and will introduce terminology and concepts that will be used
   in other documents in the series.

Internet-Draft   EMAIL Part One: Introduction & Overview       July 2005

1. Introduction

1.1. A Brief History of the Internet Message Format

   The origin of Internet Messaging can be traced back to roots in the
   TELNET and FTP protocols in the ARPANET.  Early message transfer
   consisted of text messages in US-ASCII, using TELNET NVT line ending
   conventions, sent using FTP commands.  There were only limited
   capabilities for authentication, and none for encryption or digital
   signatures.  Delivery instructions were conveyed as transport
   protocol arguments.  RFC 561 [I1.RFC561] standardized the message
   format, separating content into a header and a body, with the header
   comprised of named fields conveying information from sender to
   recipient.  Actual delivery remained controlled by command arguments
   separate from message content.  Message content was not altered
   during transport.

   Special purpose messaging commands in FTP were obsoleted by separate
   messaging protocols, first MTP [I2.RFC772], [I3.RFC780], then SMTP
   [I4.RFC788], [I5.STD10], [I6.STD10], [I7.STD10], [I8.RFC2821].
   Despite early identification of the desirability of keeping
   "envelope" information separate from the message header and body
   [I9.RFC724], SMTP introduced the addition of trace fields pertaining
   to transport, which were written onto the message content instead of
   being conveyed in command arguments or being placed in a separate
   location.  Typical SMTP transport of the time involved direct
   connection from sender to recipient, resulting in limited expansion
   of the message content.  However in some circumstances, and as the
   operation of SMTP has evolved, there are typically many lines added
   to the message header.  This has resulted in burying the "wheat" of
   the originator message header fields in the "chaff" of
   transport-related markings.

   Further changes to the basic Internet Message Format to date
   [I10.RFC733], [I11.STD11], [I12.RFC2822] have focused on tightening
   and clarifying message header field syntax.

   Additional extensions have resulted in more fields being added to the
   message header, exacerbating the problem.  In response to the
   problem, user agent implementors have elected to suppress
   presentation of all but a few message header fields.  Unfortunately,
   many of the fields conveying user-to-user, end-to-end information
   have become innocent casualties in the extermination of presentation
   of undesirable cruft, at least in some implementations.  Some
   extension fields specify syntax which is inconsistent in sometimes
   subtle ways with the user-oriented basic format fields [I13.Spec],
   complicating message parsers.

   Meanwhile, the practice of modifying message content in transit has
   rendered end-to-end digital signatures and other desirable features
   difficult to achieve.  Specialized mechanisms, usually using MIME
   [I14.RFC2045], [I15.RFC2046], such as [I16.RFC1847] have addressed
   some specific issues, while the issue of clutter in presentation has
   remained largely unaddressed.

1.2. Other Directions

   As the U.S. ARPANET has transformed into the international Internet,
   there has been a desire for internationalization of text components
   of message content.  MIME [I17.RFC2047], [I18.RFC2231], [I19.Errata]
   has again addressed some of these issues, but further
   internationalization has been limited by the need to maintain
   backward compatibility with the large installed base of software
   which transports and processes the Internet Message Format.

   User agents, the originator's as well as recipients', sometimes wish
   to record information or to advertise themselves.

   Message submission agents may wish to record authentication or other
   information pertaining to a message or its submission.

   List expanders often wish to provide information.  Unfortunately,
   that compounds the obfuscation of user-to-user communication, and
   there is interaction between multiple list expansions.

   Gateways also typically [I20.RFC2156] record information in the
   message header.

   Message delivery agents (MDAs), filters such as Sieve [I21.RFC3028]
   implementations, and message stores may also wish to record
   information in the message header.

2. Goals

   The goals of specifying an extensible message format include:

   o Backward compatibility with existing transport and user agents

   o Separation of end-to-end, user-to-user communications from
     transport markings, advertisements, and other information,
     facilitating end-to-end security measures (signing and encryption)

   o Compartmentalization of different types of ancillary information
     and markings both to reduce confusion resulting from mixture of
     data and to simplify identificatio and handling of specific types
     of ancillary information

   o Extensibility to provide a migration path for enhanced
     internationalization, experiments with alternate message format
     syntax, etc., while maintaining a reliable, backward-compatible
     means of communications

3. Mechanism, Implementation Overview, and Notation

   The specification detailed in companion documents and outlined
   briefly below uses MIME [I14.RFC2045], [I15.RFC2046] media types and
   mechanisms as words and phrases to form a language for specifying an
   extensible message interchange format.  Despite the acronym chosen
   for the format, its applicability is not limited to electronic mail;

Internet-Draft   EMAIL Part One: Introduction & Overview       July 2005

   just as the current Internet Message Format is used by applications
   such as voice mail, fax, data interchange, and news, those
   applications may choose to extend and use this format.

   The overall extensible format consists of a MIME multipart wrapper
   containing a multipart/alternative wrapper which in turn contains (at
   least in initial implementations) a MIME message/rfc822 content.
   There may be additional parts in the outer wrapper for holding
   information specific to different types of processors (list
   expanders, user agents, etc.).  The inner multipart/alternative
   wrapper provides extensibility; as new message formats are devised,
   they may be included in addition to the backward-compatible
   message/rfc822 component.

   For brevity, discussion and illustration of the extensible message
   format will use an indented presentation with part numbering based on
   that specified in [I22.RFC3501].  A minimal instance would be shown
   as:

   multipart/email 0
    multipart/alternative 1
     message/rfc822 1.1
      text/plain 1.1.1
    close delimiter 1
   close delimiter 0

4. Compatibility

   Because the format is a MIME message, it is compatible with existing
   transport mechanisms and with MIME-compatible message processors.
   Transport mechanisms like SMTP are free to scribble various and
   sundry things in the header of the outermost wrapper without
   invalidating any digital signature applied to the inner, end-to-end
   content, and without obfuscating the communications therein.
   Non-MIME recipient user agents will of course display the message as
   text, as is the case with any MIME message and such agents.  At least
   the markings made by transport etc. will be separated from the
   user-to-user content.

5. Extensibility Roadmap

   As additional information separate from user content is identified
   for inclusion in the overall message, media types to contain that
   information can be defined and incorporated in the outer multipart
   wrapper's parts.  Additional message formats can be defined for the
   user communications and incorporated in the inner
   multipart/alternative wrapper.  Such formats might incorporate
   additional internationalization features and/or might use a more
   rigorous syntax, perhaps even self-describing header information.

6. Security Considerations

   No security considerations are addressed by this memo.  Security
   considerations are addressed in companion documents.

7. Internationalization Considerations

   This memo raises no new internationalization considerations.  It
   identifies some internationalization issues in general terms, and
   discusses an approach to those issues, also in general terms.
   Internationalization issues are discussed in detail in companion
   documents.

8. IANA Considerations

   This memo adds no new IANA considerations.

   As noted in the "Status of this Memo" section, this document is an
   Internet-Draft, and as such is a "work in progress", not a standard.
   Reference to this document's contents as "this standard" in the
   boilerplate are inappropriate.

   The author of this document is not responsible for the boilerplate
   text.

   Comments regarding the silliness, lack of accuracy, and lack of
   precision of the boilerplate text should be directed to the IESG, not
   to the author.
