Abstract 
 
   The Smart Grid [8] initiative is an effort in modernization of the 
   electricity grid using communication technology with the primary 
   goals of reducing energy consumption, reducing cost (utilities and 
   consumers), increasing reliability and the creation of new services 
   for all participants in the value chain. The core focus of this 
   initiative is the specification of a 'Communications Overlay' network 
   which can help facilitate intelligent communication (discovery, 
   session establishment, routing, addressing to name a few)  between 
   various nodes of the heterogeneous Smart Grid network.

  Motivation for SIP as an application protocol for 6lowpan devices   
 
 
   One of the 'network segments' of the Smart Grid network is the Home 
   Area Network (HAN) and how residential and/or commercial devices 
   (such as TV, washing machine, surveillance camera, etc.) interact 
   with the smart meter/energy management system and vice-versa. 
    
   This draft is an initial input for consideration of SIP as an 
   appropriate application protocol for use inside devices that operate 
   over low powered IP networks.  
    
   The authors do NOT propose the use of SIP for all HAN devices. 
   Rather, the authors believe that SIP is an appropriate protocol for 
   certain categories of devices and therefore, the 6lowapp group should 
   consider SIP as an appropriate protocol for the same. The final 
   protocol that is ideal for a particular device communication will 
   always be determined by the use-case(s) that are envisioned for the 
   same. 
    
   This draft does NOT discuss the use of SIP inside the smart meter 
   (while the authors believe that the smart meter would also benefit 
   from SIP, that is the scope of another draft and does not apply to 
   the 6lowapp work). Therefore, in all diagrams and references, the 
   authors have used the term 'Energy Management System (EMS)' to refer 
   to the customer premise EMS that may or may not be the smart meter 
   itself.

   The term EMS refers to the customer premise Energy Management System 
   which may be the smart meter or an adjunct devices that communicates 
   with the utility core network for the purposes of energy management 
   and billing.

1.  Introduction
 
   A 'smart home' is a modern day home in which a significant portion of 
   physical objects have built-in intelligence and communications 
   capability. Naturally, different devices in the home will require 
   different levels of intelligence. Furthermore as devices get more 
   intelligent, the mechanisms used to interact with them will also get 
   more complex.  
    
   Furthermore, home area network applications will not be about 
   limiting and relating objects to specific homes, but rather need to 
   be capable and open to much more complex relationships. For example, 
   if a guest is charging their electric car at a friends house, we 
   should consider applications that will understand that the charge 
   should appear on the guests electric bill and not that of the the 
   friend.  
    
   As another example, it is entirely possible that your home IPTV 
   interacts with the EMS and monitors the current price of electricity 
   and when it reaches a particular threshold, automatically negotiates 
   a lower bit rate codec as well as steps down brightness a few 
   notches. 
    
   Continuing this line of thought, your thermostat could be more than 
   just a programmable 'time-of-day' device. Consider for example, your 
   cell phone being the 'location updater' for your thermostat and when 
   the owner is a few miles away from home, the heating automatically 
   starts. Much better than you arriving early one evening and freezing 
   for 15 minutes before your thermostat warms up, isn't it? 
    
   The examples above all show why the authors feel that the future home 
   services will not just be limited to traditional home appliances but 
   which will also involve other communication devices such as your 
   3G/GSM/CDMA phone, your electric car and others. 
    
   SIP is an excellent choice for middleware in building out these sort 
   of applications as this I-D will describe. 
   
   2. A response to the 6Lowapp problem statement 
    
   This section provides a brief response to relevant sections of the 
   6lowapp problem statement as specified in [7]. 
 
 
Roychowdhury             Expires    April 2010                 [Page 3] 
  Motivation for SIP as an application protocol for 6lowpan devices   
 
 
    
   Section 1, Problem Statement: 
    
   "In addition, some of the applications may require optimizations in 
   terms of bandwidth usage; for example, the usual data formats both 
   headers and body) are perceived to be too chatty for the 50-60 byte 
   payloads possible in LoWPANs.  Their interpretation and generation 
   may require too much code for the 8-bit and 16-bit processors 
   dominating LoWPAN nodes"
    
   Response: The authors agree that there is a large set of limited 
   processing power devices for which an appropriate compression 
   mechanism may be required. It should be noted that any compression 
   scheme that applied to HTTP payload can also be applied to SIP. The 
   authors also believe that there will be devices classes that can 
   accommodate more bandwidth and where a new compression mechanism may 
   or may not be needed. 
    
   Section 2, Node and Network Characteristics: 
    
   "As mentioned in the introduction, the 6LowApp application protocol   
   requirements are strongly influenced by the specific characteristics   
   of LoWPAN nodes and networks."
    
   Response: The authors completely agree and further believe that there 
   are several use cases where SIP will be the appropriate protocol. The 
   authors also believe that since SIP has the capability to encapsulate 
   any payload as part of its message structure, other protocols, such 
   as ZigBee SE profile can also be extended and can benefit from the 
   added advantages that SIP provides. 
    
   Section 2, Node and Network Characteristics: 
    
   "Constrained LoWPAN nodes often only have a few KiB of RAM, and their   
   code size tends to be limited to a value between 48 KiB and 128 KiB.   
   Their processing speed may be limited by energy considerations to a   
   few million instructions per second (which, at a duty cycle of 0.1 %   
   or less, may mean a thousand instructions per second!)." 
    
   Response: The authors believe these numbers likely depict the low end 
   of loWPAN devices. Furthermore, the authors also know, from past 
   experience that it is entirely possible to write a robust SIP stack 
   in under 40K footprint (ANSI-C, compiler optimized), with sufficient 
   functionality to meet the requirements of a HAN device. 
    
    
      Section 3, Application Protocols:

  Motivation for SIP as an application protocol for 6lowpan devices   
 
 
    
   "The use of UDP and the limited packet sizes efficiently supported by   
   LoWPANs make relatively verbose protocols such as HTTP less  
   desirable.  On the other hand, key principles of the web such as   
   resource identifiers (URIs), content types (MIME), statelessness,   
   proxy support etc. are most desirable." 
    
   Response: SIP works well over both TCP as well as UDP (SIP has its 
   own application level re-transmission logic). Furthermore, SIP 
   supports URIs, MIME, statelessness, proxy support and more, making it 
   well suitable. 
    
   Section 4, Supporting protocols 
    
   Response: SIP as a protocol is designed to be able to either 
   encapsulate or initiate sessions that may need other protocols. For 
   example, an SLP query could  be embedded inside a SIP request and 
   take advantages of the routing flexibility of SIP. On the other hand, 
   SIP could be used to initiate a subsequent session, say a TFTP 
   session that executes immediately after the SIP session without any 
   encapsulation requirements. Similarly, data formats like ANSI C12.18 
   etc. can be encapsulated inside SIP. 
    
    
    
2.1     Advantages of SIP 
    
   SIP brings in a lot of advantages for HAN devices, only some of which 
   are described below: 
    
   o Addressing: SIP devices are addressed by a URI scheme (example 
     sip:mycar@myhome.net) and are independent of their current IP 
     address. This means that the device can be reached anywhere as 
     long as it is connected and the IP address will be resolved as 
     part of routing at that instance of communication 
    
   o Groups and Forking: The architecture of SIP allows for multiple 
     devices to be addressable (grouped) using a single id (example: 
     clocks@myhome.net). This makes it simple to issue one command that 
     gets "forked" (i.e. sent in parallel) to multiple devices (example 
     an IM "set dst on" to clocks@myhome.net, or, say "set max heating 
     72F" to thermostats@myhome.net) 
 
   o Events - Subscriptions and Notifications: SIP allows for any 
     device to subscribe and be notified of any event that is triggered 
     on that device. For example, your thermostat could subscribe to 
     the "EnergyRate" event of the smart meter and if the rate/kwh were 
     to increase beyond a point, the thermostat would be notified and 
     may choose to adjust its setting of heating automatically.

  Motivation for SIP as an application protocol for 6lowpan devices   
 
 
 
 
   o Mobility: SIP supports mobility at the application layer, 
     primarily due to its use of URIs for addressing. A device can 're-
     register' its current location dynamically with its home proxy and 
     can be reached even if its real address is different from the 
     known address. 
 
   o Security: SIP integrates well with security. It supports a variety 
     of security mechanisms such as TLS, MD5-Auth, AKA, PKI etc. 
     Furthermore, different devices can use different security 
     protocols (or none) depending on their need with SIP which serves 
     very well for limited capability devices/networks 
 
   o Offer-Answer: SIP is modeled around an offer-answer model which 
     ensures that a session is established using capabilities that both 
     endpoints support. For example, if a homeowner were to monitor his 
     home nanny cam using his desk phone, it would automatically detect 
     the phone does not support video and would only provide an audio 
     stream 
 
   o Discovery: SIP natively supports both device and capability 
     discovery. For example, clocks@myhome.net may result in the 
     initial communication reaching all the clocks of the house (alarm 
     clock, radio clock, oven clock). Similarly, the SIP OPTIONS method 
     can be used to discover the capabilities of multiple devices 
     before initiating a communication with a selected device. As 
     another  specific example, even though UPnP is the consumer 
     electronics industries' de-facto standard for discovery and 
     control, the architecture does not meet the requirements for use 
     on a pervasive network or lend to mobility. In addition, there is 
     general consensus that its SOA architecture is unnecessarily 
     complex. For this reason, the industry is in the process of 
     standardizing the concept of a UPnP to SIP interface[11] as the 
     preferred mechanism for pervasive device control and discovery. 
 
   o Presence: SIP, specifically the work done in SIMPLE [10] brings in 
     a strong concept of presence to SIP. A SIP device can advertise 
     its current presence state (busy, online, offline, DND, lowpower-
     sleep etc.) which can both help communicating entities know the 
     current state of the device before reaching out to it, as well as 
     open up a lot of innovative service creation possibilities 
     (example: if my house TV is in 'transmitting' state for 3 hours, 
     and I am on travel, I may decide to switch it off, not just to 
     save power, but to ensure my kids are not taking advantage of 
     their parent-free-time) 
 
   o Converged communication: SIP has the ability to interwork multiple 
     devices to execute a single service. Consider for example, a

     situation where your EMS has detected a sudden rise in power usage 
     that is not the norm based on your past trends. It may choose to 
     alert you of this situation both by email, as well as a digital 
     signage overlay on your TV that gives you more information and 
     then allow you to rectify the situation appropriately. 
 
   o Extensible: The architecture of SIP easily enables new methods and 
     extensions as applicable. This means that if SIP needs to be 
     modified to fit into a particular network/device characteristic it 
     can easily be done. 
    
    
    
3.   Debunking some SIP myths 
    
   This section debunks some common myths that follow SIP and may be 
   especially applicable for 6lowapp work 
    
3.1     SIP has VoIP baggage and is therefore complicated 
    
   SIP can be used completely independent of VoIP. For example, one can 
   just use SIP IM messages to communicate between devices which does 
   not need a session to be established  
    
    
3.2    SIP requires too many messages  
    
   As described in 3.1, depending on functionality requirements, SIP 
   messages can be significantly reduced. Furthermore, SIP has a concept 
   of implicit registrations/subscriptions where for a defined and 
   secure network, certain operations can be 'provisioned' automatically 
   without the actual messages flowing. 
    
3.3    We already use XXX protocol. Do I need to replace XXX? 
    
   Not really. As described before, SIP works very well with many 
   protocols. The architecture goals of SIP is not to annihilate other 
   protocols but to work with as many protocols as are appropriate. If 
   any other protocol does a better job than SIP for a particular role, 
   so be it. SIP can be used to initiate the 'setup session' after which 
   XXX can take over, or, XXX can be encapsulated inside SIP. Why you 
   would choose to use SIP in this mode would depend on whether the 
   advantages of SIP (2.1) are beneficial to you.

5.   Conclusion 
    
   The authors hope to have presented some key advantages of SIP and why 
   we believe SIP should be a candidate protocol for consideration for 
   the 6lowapps group. 
    
    
    
    
    

6.   Security Considerations 
    
   All the security considerations of [3] will also apply to this draft. 
   Furthermore, it is likely that the role of private networks and 
   stronger security mechanisms will be more important here do to the 
   nature of devices being controlled (typically personal home devices).
