 BLAKE2 Algorithms and Identifiers for use in the Internet X.509 Public
  Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL)

                      draft-wconner-blake2sigs-00

Abstract

   This document describes the conventions for using the BLAKE2b-512
   hash function with each of the following signature algorithms: RSA
   Public-Key Cryptography Standards #1 version 1.5 (RSA PKCS#1 v1.5),
   RSA Probabilistic Signature Scheme (RSASSA-PSS), RSA Encryption
   Scheme - Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (RSAES-OAEP), Elliptic
   Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), and Edwards-curve Digital
   Signature Algorithm (EdDSA).  This specification applies to the
   Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) when digital
   signatures are used to sign certificates and certificate revocation
   lists (CRLs).  This document also specifies the object identifiers
   (OIDs) for the combinations of the BLAKE2b-512 hash function with the
   aforementioned signature algorithms.

1.  Introduction

   The SHA-2 family of hash functions is currently the only secure and
   widely supported option for digital signatures in the PKIX ecosystem.
   While there is no reason to be seriously concerned about the security
   of SHA-2, which is still acceptable according to NIST SP 800-131A
   rev. 1 [SP-800-131A], numerous previous hash functions have
   eventually suffered from collision attacks and needed to be replaced.
   Since it takes a very long time to establish support for new
   primitives in the PKIX ecosystem, it seems prudent to have an
   alternative prepared.

   This document specifies object identifiers (OIDs) to identify the
   combination of BLAKE2b-512 [BLAKE2] with each of RSA PKCS#1 v1.5,
   RSASSA-PSS, RSAES-OAEP, ECDSA, and EdDSA.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Algorithm Support

   This section describes the signature algorithms and corresponding
   OIDs, which may be used in conjunction with the BLAKE2b-512 hash
   function.  The OIDs will be assigned under the following OID arc,
   which is based on the OID tree from [RFC7693].


             sigAlgs OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
                 iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1)
                 private(4) enterprise(1) kudelski(1722) cryptography(12) 4
             }


2.1.  RSA PKCS#1 v1.5

   [RFC2313] specifies the RSA PKCS #1 v1.5 signature algorithm.  This
   section specifies a single OID to identify the combination of
   BLAKE2b-512 with RSA PKCS#1 v1.5.


               id-rsaEncryption-with-blake2b512 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= TBD


2.2.  RSASSA-PSS

   [RFC4055] specifies the RSASSA-PSS signature algorithm.  This section
   specifies a single OID to identify the combination of BLAKE2b-512
   with RSASSA-PSS.


                 id-RSASSA-PSS-with-blake2b512 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= TBD


2.3.  RSAES-OAEP

   [RFC4055] specifies the RSAES-OAEP signature algorithm.  This section
   specifies a single OID to identify the combination of BLAKE2b-512
   with RSAES-OAEP.


                 id-RSAEP-OAEP-with-blake2b512 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= TBD

2.4.  ECDSA

   NIST FIPS PUB 186-4 [FIPS-186-4] specifies the ECDSA signature
   algorithm.  This section specifies a single OID to identify the
   combination of BLAKE2b-512 with ECDSA.


                  id-ecdsa-with-blake2b512 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= TBD


2.5.  EdDSA

   [RFC8032] specifies the EdDSA signature algorithm.  This section
   specifies two OIDs to identify the combination of BLAKE2b-512 with
   the edwards25519 and edwards448 curves.


                  id-Ed25519-with-blake2b512 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= TBD


                  id-Ed448-with-blake2b512 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= TBD

   The authors would like to thank the [BLAKE2] designers for answering
   our questions about BLAKE2 and allowing us to use their object
   identifier space.  In particular, our email exchanges with Jean-
   Philippe Aumasson were very helpful.
