  Reusable Interface Definitions for Constrained RESTful Environments
                     draft-ietf-core-interfaces-14

Abstract

   This document defines a set of Constrained RESTful Environments
   (CoRE) Link Format Interface Descriptions [RFC6690] applicable for
   use in constrained environments.  These include the: Actuator,
   Parameter, Read-only parameter, Sensor, Batch, Linked Batch and Link
   List interfaces.

   The Batch, Linked Batch and Link List interfaces make use of resource
   collections.  This document further describes how collections relate
   to interfaces.

   Many applications require a set of interface descriptions in order
   provide the required functionality.  This document defines an
   Interface Description attribute value to describe resources
   conforming to a particular interface.

1.  Introduction

   IETF Standards for machine to machine communication in constrained
   environments describe a REST protocol and a set of related
   information standards that may be used to represent machine data and
   machine metadata in REST interfaces.  CoRE Link-format is a standard
   for doing Web Linking [RFC8288] in constrained environments.  SenML
   [RFC8428] is a simple data model and representation format for
   composite and complex structured resources.  CoRE Link-Format and
   SenML can be used by CoAP [RFC7252] or HTTP servers.

   The discovery of resources offered by a constrained server is very
   important in machine-to-machine applications where there are no
   humans in the loop.  Machine application clients must be able to
   adapt to different resource organizations without advance knowledge
   of the specific data structures hosted by each connected thing.  The
   use of Web Linking for the description and discovery of resources
   hosted by constrained origin servers is specified by CoRE Link Format
   [RFC6690].  CoRE Link Format additionally defines a link attribute
   for interface description ("if") that can be used to describe the
   REST interface of a resource, and may include a link to a description
   document.

   This document defines a set of Link Format interface descriptions for
   some common design patterns that enable the server side composition
   and organization, and client side discovery and consumption, of
   machine resources using Web Linking.  A client discovering the "if"
   link attribute will be able to consume resources based on its
   knowledge of the expected interface types.  In this sense the
   Interface Type acts in a similar way as a Content-Format, but as a
   selector for a high level functional abstraction.

   An interface description describes a resource in terms of its
   associated content formats, data types, URI templates, REST methods,
   parameters, and responses.  Basic interface descriptions are defined
   for sensors, and actuators.

   A set of collection types is defined for organizing resources for
   discovery, and for various forms of bulk interaction with resource
   sets using typed embedding links.

   This document first defines the concept of collection interface
   descriptions.  It then defines a number of generic interface
   descriptions that may be used in contrained environments.  Several of
   these interface descriptions utilise collections.

   Whilst this document assumes the use of CoAP [RFC7252], the REST
   interfaces described can also be realized using HTTP [RFC7230].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   This document requires readers to be familiar with all the terms and
   concepts that are discussed in [RFC8288] and [RFC6690].  This
   document makes use of the following additional terminology:

   Gradual Reveal:  A REST design where resources are discovered
      progressively using Web Linking.

   Interface Description:  The Interface Description describes the
      generic REST interface to interact with a resource or a set of
      resources.  Its use is described via the Interface Description
      'if' attribute which is an opaque string used to provide a name or
      URI indicating a specific interface definition used to interact
      with the target resource.  One can think of this as describing
      verbs usable on a resource.

   Resource Discovery:  The process allowing a client to identify
      resources being hosted on an origin server.

3.1.  Introduction to Collections

   A Collection is a resource which represents one or more related
   resources.  [RFC6573] describes the "item" and "collection" Link
   Relation.  An "item" link relation identifies a member of collection.
   A "collection" indicates the collection that an item is a member of.
   For example, a collection might be a resource representing a catalog
   of products, while an item is a resource related to an individual
   product.

   Section 1.2.2/[RFC6690] also describes resource collections.

   This document uses the concept of "collection" and applies it to
   interface descriptions.  A collection interface description consists
   of a set of links and a set of items pointed to by the links which
   may be sub-resources of the collection resource.  The collection
   interface descriptions described in this document are Link List,
   Batch and Linked Batch.

   The links in a collection are represented in CoRE Link-Format
   Content-Formats including JSON and CBOR variants, and the items in
   the collection may be represented by SenML, including JSON and CBOR
   variants.  In general, a collection may support items of any
   available Content-Format.

   A particular resource item may be a member of more than one
   collection at a time by being linked to, but may only be a
   subresource of one collection.

   Some collections may have pre-configured items and links, and some
   collections may support dynamic creation and removal of items and
   links.  Likewise, modification of items in some collections may be
   permitted, and not in others.

   Links in collections may be selected for processing by a particular
   request by using Query Filtering as described in CoRE Link-Format
   [RFC6690].

3.2.  Use Cases for Collections

   Collections may be used to provide gradual reveal of resources on an
   endpoint.  There may be a small set of links at the .well-known/core
   location, which may in turn point to other collections of resources
   that represent device information, device configuration, device
   management, and various functional clusters of resources on the
   device.

   A collection may be used to group a set of like resources for bulk
   state update or actuation.  For example, the brightness control
   resources of a number of luminaries may be grouped by linking to them
   in a collection.  The collection type may support receiving a single
   update from a client and sending that update to each resource item in
   the collection.

   Items may be sub-resources of the collection resource.  This enables
   updates to multiple items in the collection to be processed together
   within the context of the collection resource.

3.3.  Collection Types

   There are three collection types defined in this document:

                       +-----------------+---------+
                       | Collection Type | if=     |
                       +-----------------+---------+
                       | Link List       | core.ll |
                       |                 |         |
                       | Batch           | core.b  |
                       |                 |         |
                       | Linked Batch    | core.lb |
                       +-----------------+---------+

                     Table 1: Collection Type Summary

   The interface description defined in this document offer a deeper
   explanation of the methods that may be applied to the three
   collections.

3.4.  Content-Formats for Collections

   The collection interfaces can use the CoRE Link-Format for the link
   representations and SenML or text/plain for representations of items.
   The examples given are for collections that expose resources and
   links in these formats.

   The choice of whether to return a representation of the links or of
   the items or of the collection format is determined by the Accept
   header option in the request.  Likewise, the choice of updating link
   metadata or item data or the collection resource itself is determined
   by the Content-Format option in the header of the update request
   operation.

   The default Content-Formats for collection types described in this
   document are:

Internet-Draft       Interface Definitions for CoRE           March 2019


   Links:  application/link-format, application/link-format+json

   Items:  application/senml+json, text/plain

3.5.  Link Embedding

   Collections may provide resource encapsulation by supporting link
   embedding.  Link embedding may be used to provide a single resource
   with which a client may interact to obtain a set of related resource
   values.  This is analogous to an image tag (link) causing the image
   to display inline in a browser window.  Link embedding enables the
   bulk processing of items in the collection using a single operation
   targeting the collection resource.  Performing a GET on a collection
   resource may return a single representation containing all of the
   embedded linked resources.  For example, a collection for
   manufacturer parameters may consist of manufacturer name, date of
   manufacture, location of manufacture, and serial number resources
   which can be read as a single SenML data object.

   A subset of resources in the collection may be selected for operation
   using Query Filtering.  Bulk Read operations using GET return a SenML
   representation of all selected resources.  Bulk item Update
   operations using PUT or POST apply the payload document to all
   selected resource items in the collection.  A Batch update is
   performed by applying the resource values in the payload document to
   all resources in the collection that match any resource name in the
   payload document.

3.6.  Links and Items in Collections

   Links use CoRE Link-Format representation by default and may point to
   any resource reachable from the context of the collection.  This
   includes links to resources with absolute paths as well as links that
   point to other network locations, if the context of the collection
   allows.  Links to sub-resources in the collection MUST have a path-
   element starting with the resource name, as per [RFC3986].  Links to
   resources in the global context MUST start with a root path
   identifier [RFC8288].  Links to other collections are formed per
   [RFC3986].

   Examples of links:

   </sen/>;if="core.lb":  Link to the /sen/ collection describing it as
      a core.lb type collection (Linked Batch)

   </sen/temp>;rt="temperature":  A link to the temp resource with an
      absolute path.

Internet-Draft       Interface Definitions for CoRE           March 2019


   <temp>;rt="temperature":  Link to the temp subresource of the
      collection in which this link appears.

   <temp>;anchor="/sen/":  A link to the temp subresource of the
      collection /sen/ which is assumed not to be a subresource of the
      collection in which the link appears, but is expected to be
      identified in the collection by resource name.

   Links in the collection MAY be Read, Updated, Added, or Removed using
   the CoRE Link-Format or JSON Merge-Patch Content-Formats on the
   collection resource.  Reading links uses the GET method and returns
   an array or list containing the link-values of all selected links.
   Links may be added to the collection using POST or PATCH methods.
   Updates to links MUST use the PATCH method and MAY use query
   filtering to select links for updating.  The PATCH method on links
   MUST use the JSON Merge-Patch Content-Format (application/merge-
   patch+json) specified in [RFC7396].

   Items in the collection SHOULD be represented using the SenML
   (application/senml+json) or plain text (text/plain) Content-Formats,
   depending on whether the representation is of a single data point or
   multiple data points.  Items MAY be represented using any supported
   Content-Format.

3.7.  Queries on Collections

   Collections MAY support query filtering as defined in CoRE Link-
   Format [RFC6690].  Operations targeting either the links or the items
   MAY select a subset of links and items in the collection by using
   query filtering.  The Content-Format specified in the request header
   selects whether links or items are targeted by the operation.

3.8.  Observing Collections

   Resource Observation via [I-D.ietf-core-dynlink] using CoAP [RFC7252]
   MAY be supported on items in a collection.  A subset of the
   conditional observe parameters MAY be specified to apply.  In most
   cases pmin and pmax are useful.  Resource observation on a
   collection's resource returns the collection representation.
   Observation Responses, or notifications, SHOULD provide the
   collection representations in SenML Content-Format.  Notifications
   MAY include multiple observations of the collection resource, with
   SenML time stamps indicating the observation times.

4.  Interface Descriptions

   This section defines REST interfaces for Sensor, Parameter, Read-Only
   Paramter and Actuator resource types, in addition to the Link List,
   Batch and Linked Batch collection types.  Each type is described
   along with its Interface Description attribute value, valid methods
   and content formats.  These are shown for each interface in the table
   below.

   The if= column defines the Interface Description (if=) attribute
   value to be used in the CoRE Link Format for a resource conforming to
   that interface.  When this value appears in the if= attribute of a
   link, the resource MUST support the corresponding REST interface
   described in this section.  The resource MAY support additional
   functionality, which is out of scope for this document.  Although
   these interface descriptions are intended to be used with the CoRE
   Link Format, they are applicable for use in any REST interface
   definition.

   The Methods column defines the methods supported by that interface,
   which are described in more detail below.

4.1.  Link List

   Link List is the base interface to provide gradual reveal of
   resources on a CoRE origin server.  It is used to retrieve (GET) a
   list of resources on an origin server.  The GET request SHOULD
   contain an Accept option with the application/link-format content
   format.  However if the resource does not support any other form of
   content-format the Accept option MAY be elided.

   Note: The use of an Accept option with application/link-format is
   recommended even though it is not strictly needed for the Link List
   interface because this interface is extended by the batch and linked
   batch interfaces where different content-formats are possible.

   The request returns a list of URI references with absolute paths to
   the resources as defined in CoRE Link Format.  This interface is
   typically used with a parent resource to enumerate sub-resources but
   may be used to reference any resource on an origin server.

   The following example interacts with a Link List /d/ containing
   Parameter sub-resources /d/name, /d/model.

   Req: GET /d/ (Accept:application/link-format)
   Res: 2.05 Content (application/link-format)
   </d/name>;rt="simple.dev.n";if="core.p",
   </d/model>;rt="simple.dev.mdl";if="core.rp"

4.2.  Batch

   The Batch interface is used to manipulate a collection of sub-
   resources at the same time.  The Batch interface description supports
   the same methods as its sub-resources, and can be used to read (GET),
   update (PUT) or apply (POST) the values of those sub-resource with a
   single resource representation.  The sub-resources of a Batch MAY be
   heterogeneous.  Hence, a method used on the Batch only applies to
   sub-resources that support it.  For example Sensor interfaces do not
   support PUT, and thus a PUT request to a Sensor member of that Batch
   would be ignored.  A batch requires the use of SenML Media types in
   order to support multiple sub-resources.

   The following example interacts with a Batch /s/ with Sensor sub-
   resources /s/light, /s/temp and /s/humidity.

Internet-Draft       Interface Definitions for CoRE           March 2019


   Req: GET /s/
   Res: 2.05 Content (application/senml+json)
   [
       { "bn": "example.com/s/" },
       { "n": "light", "v": 123, "u": "lx" },
       { "n": "temp", "v": 27.2, "u": "Cel" },
       { "n": "humidity", "v": 80, "u": "%RH" }
   ]

4.3.  Linked Batch

   The Linked Batch interface is an extension of the Batch interface.
   Contrary to the basic Batch which is a collection statically defined
   by the origin server, a Linked Batch is dynamically controlled by a
   client.  A Linked Batch resource has no sub-resources.  Instead the
   resources forming the batch are referenced using Web Linking
   [RFC8288] and the CoRE Link Format [RFC6690].  A request with a POST
   method and a content format of application/link-format simply appends
   new resource links to the collection.  The links in the payload MUST
   reference a resource on the origin server with an absolute path.  A
   DELETE request removes the entire collection.  All other requests
   available for a basic Batch are still valid for a Linked Batch.

   The following example interacts with a Linked Batch /l/ and creates a
   collection containing /s/light, /s/temp and /s/humidity in 2 steps.

      { "n": "/s/temp", "v": 27.2, "u": "Cel" },
      { "n": "/s/humidity", "v": 80, "u": "%RH" }
   ]

   Req: DELETE /l/
   Res: 2.02 Deleted

4.4.  Sensor

   The Sensor interface allows the value of a sensor resource to be read
   (GET).  The Media type of the resource can be either plain text or
   SenML.  Plain text MAY be used for a single measurement that does not
   require meta-data.  For a measurement with meta-data such as a unit
   or time stamp, SenML SHOULD be used.  A resource with this interface
   MAY use SenML to return multiple measurements in the same
   representation, for example a list of recent measurements.

   The following are examples of Sensor interface requests in both text/
   plain and application/senml+json.

   Req: GET /s/humidity (Accept: text/plain)
   Res: 2.05 Content (text/plain)
   80

   Req: GET /s/humidity (Accept: application/senml+json)
   Res: 2.05 Content (application/senml+json)
   [
       { "bn": "example.com/s/" },
       { "n": "humidity", "v": 80, "u": "%RH" }
   ]

4.5.  Parameter

   The Parameter interface allows configurable parameters and other
   information to be modeled as a resource.  The value of the parameter
   can be read (GET) or update (PUT).  Plain text or SenML Media types
   MAY be returned from this type of interface.

   The following example shows request for reading and updating a
   parameter.

   Req: GET /d/name
   Res: 2.05 Content (text/plain)
   node5

   Req: PUT /d/name (text/plain)
   outdoor
   Res: 2.04 Changed

4.6.  Read-only Parameter

   The Read-only Parameter interface allows configuration parameters to
   be read (GET) but not updated.  Plain text or SenML Media types MAY
   be returned from this type of interface.

   The following example shows request for reading such a parameter.

   Req: GET /d/model
   Res: 2.05 Content (text/plain)
   SuperNode200

4.7.  Actuator

   The Actuator interface is used by resources that model different
   kinds of actuators (changing its value has an effect on its
   environment).  Examples of actuators include for example LEDs,
   relays, motor controllers and light dimmers.  The current value of
   the actuator can be read (GET) or the actuator value can be updated

   (PUT).  In addition, this interface allows the use of POST to change
   the state of an actuator, for example to toggle between its possible
   values.  Plain text or SenML Media types MAY be returned from this
   type of interface.  A resource with this interface MAY use SenML to
   include multiple measurements in the same representation, for example
   a list of recent actuator values or a list of values to updated.

   The following example shows requests for reading, setting and
   toggling an actuator (turning on a LED).

   Req: GET /a/1/led
   Res: 2.05 Content (text/plain)
   0

   Req: PUT /a/1/led (text/plain)
   1
   Res: 2.04 Changed

   Req: POST /a/1/led (text/plain)
   Res: 2.04 Changed

   Req: GET /a/1/led
   Res: 2.05 Content (text/plain)

5.  Security Considerations

   An implementation of a client needs to be prepared to deal with
   responses to a request that differ from what is specified in this
   document.  A server implementing what the client thinks is a resource
   with one of these interface descriptions could return malformed
   representations and response codes either by accident or maliciously.
   A server sending maliciously malformed responses could attempt to
   take advantage of a poorly implemented client for example to crash
   the node or perform denial of service.  Conversely, a malicious
   client could attempt to write to arbitrary resources on a poorly
   implemented server described in a linked batch.

Appendix A.  Current Usage of Interfaces

   Editor's note: This appendix will be removed.  It is only included
   for information.

   This appendix analyses the current landscape with regards the
   definition and use of collections and interfaces.  This should be
   considered when considering the scope of this document.

A.1.  Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) Link Format (IETF)

   [RFC6690] assumes that different deployments or application domains
   will define the appropriate REST Interface Descriptions along with
   Resource Types to make discovery meaningful.  It highlights that
   collections are often used for these interfaces.

   Whilst 3.2/[RFC6690] defines a new Interface Description 'if'
   attribute the procedures around it are about the naming of the
   interface not what information should be included in the
   documentation about the interface.

A.2.  Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF)

   The OIC Core Specification [OIC-Core] most closely aligns with the
   work in this specification.  It makes use of interface descriptions
   as per [RFC6690] and has registered several interface identifiers
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/core-parameters/core-
   parameters.xhtml#if-link-target-att-value).  These interface
   descriptors are similar to those defined in this specification.  From
   a high level perspective:

   links list:   OCF (oic.if.ll) -> IETF (core.ll)
                 Note: it's called "link list" in the IETF.
   linked batch: OCF (oic.if.b) -> IETF (core.lb)
   read-only:    OCF (oic.if.r) -> IETF (core.rp)
   read-write:   OCF (oic.if.rw) -> IETF (core.p)
   actuator:     OCF (oic.if.a) -> IETF (core.a)
   sensor:       OCF (oic.if.s) -> IETF (core.s)
   batch:        No OCF equivalent -> IETF (core.b)

   Some of the OCF interfaces make use of collections.

   The OIC Core specification does not use the concept of function sets.
   It does however discuss the concept of profiles.  The OCF defines two
   sets of documents.  The core specification documents such as
   [OIC-Core] and vertical profile specification documents which provide
   specific information for specific applications.  The OIC Smart Home
   Device Specification [OIC-SmartHome] is one such specification.  It
   provides information on the resource model, discovery and data types.
