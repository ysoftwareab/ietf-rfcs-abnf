template-description =
     The printer:raw-tcp: URL describes a transparent bidirectional
     communication channel for printing. Print data, status, messages,
     etc is written or read by opening a TCP connection to the port in 
     the service URL. How data is formatted and sent across the
     connection is decided by the printing client and the printer
     service and is not defined by this template.
