   Description:  This parameter MUST be specified on all LINK
      properties, and defines the type of reference.  This allows
      programs consuming this data to automatically scan for references
      they support.  For example, a mobile device may be able to consume
      LOCATION references, but not other types of reference.

   Registration:  These relation types are registered in [TODO ref to
      draft-nottingham-http-link-header].
