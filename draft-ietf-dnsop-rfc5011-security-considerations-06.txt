             Security Considerations for RFC5011 Publishers
          draft-ietf-dnsop-rfc5011-security-considerations-06

Abstract

   This document extends the RFC5011 rollover strategy with timing
   advice that must be followed in order to maintain security.
   Specifically, this document describes the math behind the minimum
   time-length that a DNS zone publisher must wait before signing
   exclusively with recently added DNSKEYs.  It contains much math and
   complicated equations, but the summary is that the key rollover /
   revocation time is much longer than intuition would suggest.  If you
   are not both publishing a DNSSEC trust anchor, and using RFC5011 to
   update that trust anchor, you probably don't need to read this
   document.

   This document also describes the minimum time-length that a DNS zone
   publisher must wait after publishing a revoked DNSKEY before assuming
   that all active RFC5011 resolvers should have seen the revocation-
   marked key and removed it from their list of trust anchors.

Internet-Draft       RFC5011 Security Considerations        October 2017


1.  Introduction

   [RFC5011] defines a mechanism by which DNSSEC validators can update
   their list of trust anchors when they've seen a new key published in
   a zone.  However, RFC5011 [intentionally] provides no guidance to the
   publishers of DNSKEYs about how long they must wait before switching
   to exclusively using recently published keys for signing records, or
   how long they must wait before ceasing publication of a revoked key.
   Because of this lack of guidance, zone publishers may derive
   incorrect assumptions about safe usage of the RFC5011 DNSKEY
   advertising, rolling and revocation process.  This document describes
   the minimum security requirements from a publisher's point of view
   and is intended to complement the guidance offered in RFC5011 (which
   is written to provide timing guidance solely to a Validating
   Resolver's point of view).

1.1.  Document History and Motivation

   To verify this lack of understanding is wide-spread, the authors
   reached out to 5 DNSSEC experts to ask them how long they thought
   they must wait before signing a zone exclusively with a new KSK
   [RFC4033] that was being introduced according to the 5011 process.
   All 5 experts answered with an insecure value, and we determined that
   this lack of operational guidance is causing security concerns today
   and wrote this companion document to RFC5011.  We hope that this
   document will rectify this understanding and provide better guidance
   to zone publishers that wish to make use of the RFC5011 rollover
   process.

1.2.  Safely Rolling the Root Zone's KSK in 2017/2018

   One important note about ICANN's [currently upcoming] 2017/2018 KSK
   rollover plan for the root zone: the timing values chosen for rolling
   the KSK in the root zone appear completely safe, and are not affected
   by the timing concerns introduced by this draft

1.3.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Background

   The RFC5011 process describes a process by which a RFC5011 Validating
   Resolver may accept a newly published KSK as a trust anchor for
   validating future DNSSEC signed records.  It also describes the
   process for publicly revoking a published KSK.  This document

Internet-Draft       RFC5011 Security Considerations        October 2017


   augments that information with additional constraints, from the
   DNSKEY publication and revocation's points of view.  Note that this
   document does not define any other operational guidance or
   recommendations about the RFC5011 process and restricts itself to
   solely the security and operational ramifications of switching to
   exclusively using recently added keys or removing a revoked keys too
   soon.

   Failure of a DNSKEY publisher to follow the minimum recommendations
   associated with this draft will result in potential denial-of-service
   attack opportunities against validating resolvers.  Failure of a
   DNSKEY publisher to publish a revoked key for a long enough period of
   time may result in RFC5011 Validating Resolvers leaving that key in
   their trust anchor storage beyond the key's expected lifetime.

3.  Terminology

   Trust Anchor Publisher  The entity responsible for publishing a
      DNSKEY that can be used as a trust anchor.

   Zone Signer  The owner of a zone intending to publish a new Key-
      Signing-Key (KSK) that will become a trust anchor by validators
      following the RFC5011 process.

   RFC5011 Validating Resolver  A DNSSEC Validating Resolver that is
      using the RFC5011 processes to track and update trust anchors.
      Sometimes referred to as a "RFC5011 Resolver"

   Attacker  An entity intent on foiling the RFC5011 Validator's ability
      to successfully adopt the Zone Signer's new DNSKEY as a new trust
      anchor or to prevent the RFC5011 Validator from removing an old
      DNSKEY from its list of trust anchors.

   sigExpirationTime  The amount of time remaining before any existing
      RRSIG's Signature Expiration time is reached.  Note that for
      organizations pre-creating signatures this time may be fairly
      lengthy unless they can be significantly assured their signatures
      can not be replayed at a later date.  sigExpirationTime will
      fundamentally be the RRSIG's Signature Expiration time minus the
      RRSIG's Signature Inception time when the signature is created.

   Also see Section 2 of [RFC4033] and [RFC7719] for additional
   terminology.

4.  Timing Associated with RFC5011 Processing

   These sections define a high-level overview of [RFC5011] processing.
   These steps are not sufficient for proper RFC5011 implementation, but
   provide enough background for the reader to follow the discussion in
   this document.  Readers need to fully understand [RFC5011] as well to
   fully comprehend the importance of this document.

4.1.  Timing Associated with Publication

   RFC5011's process of safely publishing a new key and then making use
   of that key falls into a number of high-level steps to be performed
   by the Trust Anchor Publisher.  This document discusses the following
   scenario, which the principle way RFC5011 is currently being used
   (even though Section 6 of RFC5011 suggests having a stand-by key
   available):

   1.  Publish a new DNSKEY in the zone, but continue to sign the zone
       with the old one.

   2.  Wait a period of time.

   3.  Begin to exclusively use recently published DNSKEYs to sign the
       appropriate resource records.

   This document discusses step 2 of the above process.  Some
   interpretations of RFC5011 have erroneously determined that the wait
   time is equal to RFC5011's "hold down time".  Section 5 describes an
   attack based on this (common) erroneous belief, which can result in a
   denial of service attack against the zone.

4.2.  Timing Associated with Revocation

   RFC5011's process of advertising that an old key is to be revoked
   from RFC5011 validating resolvers falls into a number of high-level
   steps:

   1.  Set the revoke bit on the DNSKEY to be revoked.

   2.  Sign the revoked DNSKEY with itself.

   3.  Wait a period of time.

   4.  Remove the revoked key from the zone.

   This document discusses step 3 of the above process.  Some
   interpretations of RFC5011 have erroneously determined that the wait
   time is equal to RFC5011's "hold down time".  This document describes

Internet-Draft       RFC5011 Security Considerations        October 2017


   an attack based on this (common) erroneous belief, which results in a
   revoked DNSKEY potentially remaining as a trust anchor in a RFC5011
   validating resolver long past its expected usage.

5.  Denial of Service Attack Considerations

   If an attacker is able to provide a RFC5011 Validating Resolver with
   past responses, such as when it is in-path or able to perform any
   number of cache poisoning attacks, the attacker may be able to leave
   compliant RFC5011-Validating Resolvers without an appropriate DNSKEY
   trust anchor.  This scenario will remain until an administrator
   manually fixes the situation.

   The time-line below illustrates this situation.

5.1.  Enumerated Attack Example

   The following example settings are used in the example scenario
   within this section:

   TTL (all records)  1 day

   sigExpirationTime  10 days

   Zone resigned every  1 day

   Given these settings, the sequence of events in Section 5.1.1 depicts
   how a Trust Anchor Publisher that waits for only the RFC5011 hold
   time timer length of 30 days subjects its users to a potential Denial
   of Service attack.  The timing schedule listed below is based on a
   Trust Anchor Publisher publishing a new Key Signing Key (KSK), with
   the intent that it will later become a trust anchor.  We label this
   publication time as "T+0".  All numbers in this sequence refer to
   days before and after this initial publication event.  Thus, T-1 is
   the day before the introduction of the new key, and T+15 is the 15th
   day after the key was introduced into the fictitious zone being
   discussed.

   In this dialog, we consider two keys within the example zone:

   K_old  An older KSK and Trust Anchor being replaced.

   K_new  A new KSK being transitioned into active use and expected to
      become a Trust Anchor via the RFC5011 process.

Internet-Draft       RFC5011 Security Considerations        October 2017


5.1.1.  Attack Timing Breakdown

   The steps shows an attack that foils the adoption of a new DNSKEY by
   a 5011 Validating Resolver when the Trust Anchor Publisher that
   starts signing and publishing with the new DNSKEY too quickly.

   T-1  The K_old based RRSIGs are being published by the Zone Signer.
      [It may also be signing ZSKs as well, but they are not relevant to
      this event so we will not talk further about them; we are only
      considering the RRSIGs that cover the DNSKEYs in this document.]
      The Attacker queries for, retrieves and caches this DNSKEY set and
      corresponding RRSIG signatures.  Note that for simplicity we
      assume the signer is not pre-signing and creating "valid in the
      future" signature sets that may be stolen and replayed even later.

   T+0  The Zone Signer adds K_new to their zone and signs the zone's
      key set with K_old.  The RFC5011 Validator (later to be under
      attack) retrieves this new key set and corresponding RRSIGs and
      notices the publication of K_new.  The RFC5011 Validator starts
      the (30-day) hold-down timer for K_new.  [Note that in a more
      real-world scenario there will likely be a further delay between
      the point where the Zone Signer publishes a new RRSIG and the
      RFC5011 Validator notices its publication; though not shown in
      this example, this delay is accounted for in the final solution
      below]

   T+5  The RFC5011 Validator queries for the zone's keyset per the
      RFC5011 Active Refresh schedule, discussed in Section 2.3 of
      RFC5011.  Instead of receiving the intended published keyset, the
      Attacker successfully replays the keyset and associated signatures
      recorded at T-1.  Because the signature lifetime is 10 days (in
      this example), the replayed signature and keyset is accepted as
      valid (being only 6 days old, which is less than
      sigExpirationTime) and the RFC5011 Validator cancels the hold-down
      timer for K_new, per the RFC5011 algorithm.

   T+10  The RFC5011 Validator queries for the zone's keyset and
      discovers a signed keyset that includes K_new (again), and is
      signed by K_old.  Note: the attacker is unable to replay the
      records cached at T-1, because they have now expired.  Thus at
      T+10, the RFC5011 Validator starts (anew) the hold-timer for
      K_new.

   T+11 through T+29  The RFC5011 Validator continues checking the
      zone's key set at the prescribed regular intervals.  During this
      period, the attacker can no longer replay traffic to their
      benefit.

Internet-Draft       RFC5011 Security Considerations        October 2017


   T+30  The Zone Signer knows that this is the first time at which some
      validators might accept K_new as a new trust anchor, since the
      hold-down timer of a RFC5011 Validator not under attack that had
      queried and retrieved K_new at T+0 would now have reached 30 days.
      However, the hold-down timer of our attacked RFC5011 Validator is
      only at 20 days.

   T+35  The Zone Signer (mistakenly) believes that all validators
      following the Active Refresh schedule (Section 2.3 of RFC5011)
      should have accepted K_new as a the new trust anchor (since the
      hold down time (30 days) + the query interval [which is just 1/2
      the signature validity period in this example] would have passed).
      However, the hold-down timer of our attacked RFC5011 Validator is
      only at 25 days (T+35 minus T+10); thus the RFC5011 won't consider
      it a valid trust anchor addition yet, as the required 30 days have
      not yet elapsed.

   T+36  The Zone Signer, believing K_new is safe to use, switches their
      active signing KSK to K_new and publishes a new RRSIG, signed with
      K_new, covering the DNSKEY set.  Non-attacked RFC5011 validators,
      with a hold-down timer of at least 30 days, would have accepted
      K_new into their set of trusted keys.  But, because our attacked
      RFC5011 Validator now has a hold-down timer for K_new of only 26
      days, it failed to accept K_new as a trust anchor.  Since K_old is
      no longer being used to sign the zone's DNSKEYs, all the DNSKEY
      records from the zone will be treated as invalid.  Subsequently,
      all of the records in the DNS tree below the zone's apex will be
      deemed invalid by DNSSEC.

6.  Minimum RFC5011 Timing Requirements

6.1.  Timing Requirements For Adding a New KSK

   Given the attack description in Section 5, the correct minimum length
   of time required for the Zone Signer to wait after publishing K_new
   but before exclusively using it and newer keys is:

      addWaitTime = addHoldDownTime
                    + sigExpirationTime
                    + activeRefresh
                    + activeRefreshOffset
                    + safetyMargin

6.1.1.  addHoldDownTime

   The addHoldDownTime is defined in Section 2.4.1 of [RFC5011] as:





Hardaker & Kumari        Expires April 19, 2018                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft       RFC5011 Security Considerations        October 2017


       The add hold-down time is 30 days or the expiration time of the
       original TTL of the first trust point DNSKEY RRSet that contained
       the new key, whichever is greater.  This ensures that at least
       two validated DNSKEY RRSets that contain the new key MUST be seen
       by the resolver prior to the key's acceptance.

6.1.2.  sigExpirationTime

   sigExpirationTime is defined in Section 3.

6.1.3.  activeRefresh

   activeRefresh time is defined by RFC5011 by

     A resolver that has been configured for an automatic update
     of keys from a particular trust point MUST query that trust
     point (e.g., do a lookup for the DNSKEY RRSet and related
     RRSIG records) no less often than the lesser of 15 days, half
     the original TTL for the DNSKEY RRSet, or half the RRSIG
     expiration interval and no more often than once per hour.


   This translates to:

    activeRefresh = MAX(1 hour,
                        MIN(sigExpirationTime / 2,
                            MAX(TTL of K_old DNSKEY RRSet) / 2,
                            15 days)
                        )

6.1.4.  activeRefreshOffset

   The activeRefreshOffset term must be added for situations where the
   activeRefresh value is not a factor of the addHoldDownTime.
   Specifically, activeRefreshOffset will be "addHoldDownTime %
   activeRefresh", where % is the mathematical mod operator (calculating
   the remainder in a division problem).  This will frequently be zero,
   but could be nearly as large as activeRefresh itself.  For
   simplicity, setting the activeRefreshOffset to the activeRefresh
   value itself is always safe.

6.1.5.  safetyMargin

   The safetyMargin is an extra period of time to account for caching,
   network delays, etc.  A suggested operational value for this is 2 *
   MAX(TTL of all records) unless the TTLs are shorter than an hour, at
   which point they start affecting the calculations in the MIN() clause




Hardaker & Kumari        Expires April 19, 2018                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft       RFC5011 Security Considerations        October 2017


   in the activeRefresh timer in Section 6.1.3.  Thus, we suggest a
   safetyMargin of at least:

     safetyMargin = MAX (1.5 hours, 2 * MAX(TTL of all records))

   RFC5011 also discusses a retryTime value for failed queries.  Our
   equation cannot take into account undeterministic failure situations,
   so it might be wise to extend the safetyMargin by some factor of
   retryTime, which is defined in RFC5011 as:

     retryTime = MAX (1 hour,
                      MIN (1 day,
                           .1 * TTL of K_old DNSKEY RRset,
                           .1 * sigExpirationTime))

6.1.6.  Fully expanded equation

   The full expanded equation, with activeRefreshOffset set to
   activeRefresh for simplicity, is:

      addWaitTime = addHoldDownTime
                    + sigExpirationTime
                    + 2 * MAX(1 hour,
                              MIN(sigExpirationTime / 2,
                                  MAX(TTL of K_old DNSKEY RRSet) / 2,
                                  15 days)
                              )
                    + (addHoldDownTime % activeRefresh)
                    + MAX(1.5 hours, 2 * MAX(TTL of all records))

6.1.7.  Timing Constraint Summary

   The important timing constraint introduced by this memo relates to
   the last point at which a validating resolver may have received a
   replayed original DNSKEY set, containing K_old and not K_new.  The
   next query of the RFC5011 validator at which K_new will be seen
   without the potential for a replay attack will occur after the
   publication time plus sigExpirationTime.  Thus, the latest time that
   a RFC5011 Validator may begin their hold down timer is an "Active
   Refresh" period after the last point that an attacker can replay the
   K_old DNSKEY set.  The worst case scenario of this attack is if the
   attacker can replay K_old seconds before the (DNSKEY RRSIG Signature
   Validity) field of the last K_old only RRSIG.

6.1.8.  Additional Considerations

   Note: our notion of addWaitTime is called "Itrp" in Section 3.3.4.1
   of [RFC7583].  The equation for Itrp in RFC7583 is insecure as it
   does not include the sigExpirationTime listed above.  The Itrp
   equation in RFC7583 also does not include the 2*TTL safety margin,
   though that is an operational consideration and not necessarily as
   critical.

6.1.8.1.  Example Results

   For the parameters listed in Section 5.1, the activeRefreshOffset is
   0, since 30 days is evenly divisible by activeRefresh (1/2 day), and
   our resulting addWaitTime is:

     addWaitTime = 30
                   + 10
                   + 1 / 2
                   + 2 * (1)        (days)

     addWaitTime = 42.5             (days)

   This addWaitTime of 42.5 days is 12.5 days longer than just the hold
   down timer.

6.2.  Timing Requirements For Revoking an Old KSK

   It is important to note that this issue affects not just the
   publication of new DNSKEYs intended to be used as trust anchors, but
   also the length of time required to continuously publish a DNSKEY
   with the revoke bit set.  Both of these publication timing
   requirements are affected by the attacks described in this document,
   but with revocation the key is revoked immediately and the
   addHoldDown timer does not apply.  Thus the minimum amount of time
   that a Trust Anchor Publisher must wait before removing a revoked key
   from publication is:

     remWaitTime = sigExpirationTime
                   + MAX(1 hour,
                         MIN((sigExpirationTime) / 2,
                             MAX(TTL of K_old DNSKEY RRSet) / 2,
                             15 days),
                         1 hour)
                   + 2 * MAX(TTL of all records)

   Note that the activeRefreshOffset time does not apply to this
   equation.

Internet-Draft       RFC5011 Security Considerations        October 2017


   Note that our notion of remWaitTime is called "Irev" in
   Section 3.3.4.2 of [RFC7583].  The equation for Irev in RFC7583 is
   insecure as it does not include the sigExpirationTime listed above.
   The Irev equation in RFC7583 also does not include the 2*TTL safety
   margin, though that is an operational consideration and not
   necessarily as critical.

   Note also that adding retryTime intervals to the remWaitTime may be
   wise, just as it was for addWaitTime in Section 6.

6.2.1.  Example Results

   For the parameters listed in Section 5.1, our example:

     remwaitTime = 10
                   + 1 / 2
                   + 2 * (1)        (days)

     remwaitTime = 12.5             (days)

   Note that for the values in this example produce a length shorter
   than the recommended 30 days in RFC5011's section 6.6, step 3.  Other
   values of sigExpirationTime and the original TTL of the K_old DNSKEY
   RRSet, however, can produce values longer than 30 days.

   Note that because revocation happens immediately, an attacker has a
   much harder job tricking a RFC5011 Validator into leaving a trust
   anchor in place, as the attacker must successfully replay the old
   data for every query a RFC5011 Validator sends, not just one.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document contains no IANA considerations.

8.  Operational Considerations

   A companion document to RFC5011 was expected to be published that
   describes the best operational practice considerations from the
   perspective of a zone publisher and Trust Anchor Publisher.  However,
   this companion document has yet to be published.  The authors of this
   document hope that it will at some point in the future, as RFC5011
   timing can be tricky as we have shown, and a BCP is clearly
   warranted.  This document is intended only to fill a single
   operational void which, when left misunderstood, can result in
   serious security ramifications.  This document does not attempt to
   document any other missing operational guidance for zone publishers.

9.  Security Considerations

   This document, is solely about the security considerations with
   respect to the Trust Anchor Publisher of RFC5011 trust anchors /
   DNSKEYs.  Thus the entire document is a discussion of Security
   Considerations when adding or removing DNSKEYs from trust anchor
   storage using the RFC5011 process.

   For simplicity, this document assumes that the Trust Anchor Publisher
   will use a consistent RRSIG validity period.  Trust Anchor Publishers
   that vary the length of RRSIG validity periods will need to adjust
   the sigExpirationTime value accordingly so that the equations in
   Section 6 and Section 6.2 use a value that coincides with the last
   time a replay of older RRSIGs will no longer succeed.

10.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to especially thank to Michael StJohns for his
   help and advice and the care and thought he put into RFC5011 itself.
   We would also like to thank Bob Harold, Shane Kerr, Matthijs Mekking,

Appendix A.  Real World Example: The 2017 Root KSK Key Roll

   In 2017, ICANN expects to (or has, depending on when you're reading
   this) roll the key signing key (KSK) for the root zone.  The relevant
   parameters associated with the root zone at the time of this writing
   is as follows:

         addHoldDownTime:                      30 days
         Old DNSKEY sigExpirationTime:         21 days
         Old DNSKEY TTL:                        2 days

   Thus, sticking this information into the equation in
   Section Section 6 yields (in days):

     addWaitTime = 30
                   + (21)
                   + MAX(MIN((21) / 2,
                             MAX(2 / 2,
                             15 days)),
                         1 hour)
                   + 2 * MAX(2)

     addWaitTime = 30 + 21 + MAX(MIN(11.5, 1, 15)), 1 hour) + 4

     addWaitTime = 30 + 21 + 1 + 4

     addWaitTime = 56 days

   Note that we use a activeRefreshOffset of 0, since 30 days is evenly
   divisible by activeRefresh (1 day).

   Thus, ICANN should wait a minimum of 56 days before switching to the
   newly published KSK (and 26 days before removing the old revoked key
   once it is published as revoked).  ICANN's current plans are to wait
   70 days before using the new KEY and 69 days before removing the old,
   revoked key.  Thus, their current rollover plans are sufficiently
   secure from the attack discussed in this memo.
