Abstract 
    
   This document outlines requirements for SIP-based entities essential 
   for participation and optional hosting of multimedia conferencing. 
   The requirements are grouped in two categories: point-to-point 
   primitives and conferencing (i.e. "beyond two participants") 
   primitives. A separate document will suggest the mapping of the 
   requirements to corresponding protocols' primitives.

        Multimedia Conferencing Requirements for SIP Based Systems 
                                      
Motivation 
    
   The goal of his document is to identify requirements for SIP 
   entities in order to participate and optionally host multimedia 
   conferencing applications in standard interoperable manner. 
    
   The requirements are grouped according to their subjects and are 
   presented as lists of primitives with motivation for each. A 
   separate document will provide both the mapping from the 
   requirements to existing protocols' primitives (whenever possible) 
   and suggest directions for required extensions (whenever the desired 
   functionality doesn't exist). 
    
   It is our goal that together both documents would provide a guide 
   for building interoperable SIP-based multimedia conferencing 
   applications. 
    
Requirements' Classification 
    
   There are many ways to classify conferencing models, requirements 
   and the solutions. Documents [6-10] present a number of approaches. 
    
   We chose to arrange the requirements in two main categories: those 
   that relate to point-to-point procedures and those that relate to 
   conferencing (i.e. "more then two participants involved") 
   procedures. Support for the both categories is required for building 
   multimedia conferencing applications. Each category is further 
   divided into sub-topics. 
    
   We believe that the primitives, listed in this document, are 
   essential for building various conferencing models that are 
   discussed in [6]. Standard definition for these primitives would 
   suffice for building conferencing models using Conferencing Servers. 
   More generally, these requirements address multimedia systems 
   comprising of terminals, gateways and conferencing servers (i.e. 
   MCUs - Multipoint Control Units). 
    
   The general model for multimedia communications is not different 
   from a "single media" communications except for the presence of more 
   then one media stream that relates to the other streams in the 
   session. Thus it is one of the goals to provide same architecture 
   and same user experience for both audio only and multimedia 
   conferencing. Requirements related to support of video are presented 
   as a separate sub-topic of point-to-point procedures. 
    
Conferencing Control 
    
General 
    
   Some conferencing models [6] can be implemented with only minor 
   additions to the SIP baseline specification or by using "out-of-
   band" conventions. Nevertheless, standard "advanced" functionality 
   and expressiveness are highly desirable.

        Multimedia Conferencing Requirements for SIP Based Systems 
                                      
   Standard SIP primitives used for building various services SHOULD be 
   used by conferencing applications whenever possible. 
    
   Same conference may be perceived by its participants as of different 
   conferencing models (such as dial-in vs. dial-out and conferencing 
   server vs. end user mixing). Additionally, the same user agent may 
   participate or host conferences of different models. Therefore, 
   different conferencing models SHOULD be built out of common basic 
   "conferencing" blocks. 
    
   We believe that in order to allow smooth services' interoperability 
   and future features' expansion, the conferencing service should be 
   explicitly identified. 
    
   It is highly RECOMMENDED that SIP entities, that don't explicitly 
   support conferencing extensions, would be able to participate in SIP 
   conferences in a basic mode, i.e. without benefiting from additional 
   information and functionality that these extensions would provide. 
    
   The following should be specified: 
    
Conference Description 
    
   Conference Description is a way of specifying a desired (but 
   unknown) conference in terms of its capabilities, modes, location, 
   etc. 
    
   One of the examples for using Conference Description is upon 
   creating a new conference. 
    
Conference Identification 
    
   Global Conference Identifier should allow for matching existing 
   (active or reserved) conferences. 
    
   One of the examples for using the Conference Identification is upon 
   joining a specific conference. The Conference Identifier SHALL be 
   included in each conference-related primitive (such as commands and 
   indications). 
    
   Note:  It is a separate design issue how to signal these values: new 
   vs. existing methods, new vs. existing headers, and INVITE vs. 
   Events model. Our preference is by NOT overloading the existing 
   fields because of the same service-interoperability issue. 
 
Commands 
    
   Standard way of issuing the following actions should be defined: 
    
   Create/Terminate Conference 
   Invite/Disconnect Participant 
   Get/Receive Conference Details 
   Get/Receive Participant Details

        Multimedia Conferencing Requirements for SIP Based Systems 
                                      
Indications 
    
   Standard way of conveying the following indications should be 
   defined: 
    
   Participant joined/left the conference 
   Participant is seen be at least one other terminal 
   Participant is seen by all 
   Participant you are seeing 
    
Visualization Commands 
    
   Standard way of issuing the following actions should be defined: 
 
      Broadcast my session, listing selected streams (if not all of 
   them are required). 
      Broadcast another participant's stream 
    
Chair Control 
    
   Chair commands such as Chair Token Management including: 
    
   Make Me Chair 
   Request Floor 
   Cancel Chair 
    
   We suggest designing these commands using a general token mechanism 
   where the "chair" is one of the token types. 
    
Conference Hierarchy 
 
   Conferencing identifiers and primitives SHALL allow in future for 
   creating sub-conferences and moving participants to and from the 
   sub-conferences. 
 
Point-to-Point Autonomous Media Control 
    
   This includes commands and indications exchanged between CODECs 
   (CODer DECoder) as a result of CODEC algorithms. In some cases it is 
   performed independently from the upper layers such as call control 
   and application actions. These commands and indications are typical 
   for video media. 
    
   Applications involving video are particularly prone to frequent 
   network changes causing packets lost, error conditions, etc. The 
   video information includes full picture frames and frames that 
   reflect changes from previous frames. Losing IP packets causes 
   synchronization problem for the decoder. Various video specific 
   techniques have been used in today's networks in order to cope with 
   fluctuating conditions with minimum service degradation. 
    
   The required primitives (together with their motivations) are 
   presented below:

        Multimedia Conferencing Requirements for SIP Based Systems 
                                      
Video Full Picture Fast Update Request 
Video GOB Fast Update Request 
Video MB Fast Update Request 
    
   These commands are to be sent from a decoder to an encoder. 
   Video CODECs (such as H.261 [4] and H.263 [5]) have a notion of 
   picture's building blocks:  "full picture", GOB and MacroBlock (MB). 
   The decoder has an ability to recognize degradation in 
   synchronization and explicitly request from an encoder for a "full 
   picture", a whole GOB or a whole MacroBlock.  
    
Video Freeze Picture Request 
    
   This command is to be sent from an encoder to a decoder. In case the 
   encoder is aware of a changes in the transmitted picture that would 
   cause lost of synchronization, it requests the decoding side to 
   freeze the picture, i.e. to stop presenting the changes, until a new 
   stable image is encoded and transmitted. 
    
Video Change Spatial Tradeoff Request 
    
   This command is to be sent from a decoder to an encoder (if the 
   encoder has the capability to dynamically change the tradeoff). This 
   is a request to change the tradeoff between temporal and spatial 
   resolutions, i.e. the tradeoff between the rate of the samples and 
   the resolution of the picture.  
    
   There are indications from decoder to encoder informing the encoder 
   of some problems, but leaving to the encoder the decision what to 
   do. These indications are usually tied to a CODEC algorithm. 
    
   These indications include: 
    
Video MB Not Decoded Indication 
    
   This indication is used to inform the encoder not to use specific 
   macro blocks for prediction. 
    
Lost Picture and Lost Partial Picture Indication 
    
   These indications are used to inform the encoder that it should use 
   some error resilience to solve the problem.  
    
Point-to-Point Call (Leg) Establishment and Management 
    
   This section describes the requirements for establishing call legs 
   and managing them. Most of the requirements are similar across 
   different SIP systems and are not limited to multimedia conferencing 
   applications, but we would like to have them here for completeness 
   of the model.

        Multimedia Conferencing Requirements for SIP Based Systems 
                                      
Default Capabilities' Lowest Common Denominator 
  
   In audio calls we expect all endpoints to support G.711 as a common 
   mode. We need to specify the mandatory video CODEC if we want to 
   have a high probability of establishing a video call with a common 
   CODEC. The typical common video CODEC, for enabling interoperability 
   with other protocols, is H.261 at QCIF resolution.  
    
Capabilities' Exchange 
    
   During call setup there is a need to establish the session based on 
   the capabilities of the participants. Since an endpoint, which can 
   be a terminal, a gateway or an MCU, can support one or more stream 
   there is a need to be able to specify alternate and simultaneous 
   capabilities. 
    
   The endpoint needs to be able to explicitly request symmetric CODECs 
   in the send and receive path. This is important for gateways and 
   MCUs that may need to work symmetric on all legs of the call. An 
   example is a gateway from SIP to H.320 [3]. These calls need 
   symmetric CODECs on the switched network side. 
    
   Video capabilities need to include the following parameters: 
     
   Algorithm (H.261, H.263, MPEG)  
   Maximum Bandwidth Supported  
   Maximum Resolution Supported (QCIF, CIF, 4CIF, custom formats)  
   Maximum Video Frame Rate    
 
Application Driven Media Control 
    
   These are requirements for requesting change of media stream or 
   bandwidth during the session. These requirements are typical for 
   multipoint and gateway calls when there is a need to change the 
   CODECs during the session. 
    
   Changing of bandwidth is required for the video stream in order to 
   be able to adapt to a congestion situation by reducing the video 
   rate. 
    
   Flow control mechanisms for controlling the bandwidth per stream and 
   per session are important. The selected algorithm does not define 
   the video bandwidth and a session can include many streams. The need 
   is to be able to define the bandwidth at the start of the connection 
   and being able to change it during the session. The reasons for 
   bandwidth control include the need to gateway a video stream from 
   the packet network to the switched network where the bandwidth is 
   defined and fixed [3]. A reason for a change during the session is 
   to be able to change the maximum bandwidth depending on network 
   congestion. For example, to reduce the video rate when we suffer a 
   lot of packet loss. The requirement is to be able to specify maximum 
   and exact bandwidth to be used by the session and a specific media.

        Multimedia Conferencing Requirements for SIP Based Systems 
                                      
   Mode request mechanism is needed to request the sender to send a 
   stream with the requested parameters. The parameters include 
   algorithm, resolution, frame rate and specific algorithm parameters 
   like interlace picture for H.263. 
    
   In cases where the communication is going to a gateway or MCU there 
   is a need to request symmetric stream. Terminals that cannot encode 
   and decode different streams may require this as well.  
     
Point-to-Point Application Control 
    
Remote Device Control 
    
   Far End Camera Control is a basic feature in video conferencing. 
   This feature enables the remote user to control the remote camera 
   (Zoom and Pan). The feature is used, for example, in medical 
   application when the remote viewer can select the view without 
   having to interrupt the people doing the operation. The requirement 
   for a standard way to do it is to enable interoperability of the 
   feature between different VC terminals. Far End Camera Control is a 
   private case of a general Remote Device Control. 
    
   It is required to have an ability to address the innate SIP/SDP 
   objects (such as media streams) at the level of the Remote Device 
   Protocol. That is in order to be able to associate a specific remote 
   device (such as a camera) with specific media streams. 
    
T.120 and Other Applications' Streams 
    
   Standard integration with T.120 [2] is required. T.120 is a data 
   conferencing protocol. Microsoft NetMeeting is one of the well-known 
   T.120 clients. The requirement is to be able to have the T.120 
   communication and the video/audio session as components of a common 
   session (or conference). 
     
   T.120 is an example of a more general requirement to be able to 
   associate different types of application streams within a common 
   session (or conference).
