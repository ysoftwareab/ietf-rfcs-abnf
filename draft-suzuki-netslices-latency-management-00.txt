              draft-suzuki-netslices-latency-management-00

Abstract

   This draft provides a use case that addresses the need for latency
   management for end-to-end data transmissions through multiple
   domains.  Specifically, examples of latency management schemes are
   described.  In addition, the necessity of a common latency management
   framework and of interfaces to gather latency information between
   edges in each domain and to determine data transmission paths is
   addressed.

Internet-Draft    Latency Management in Network Slices        March 2018


1.  Introduction

   This draft provides a use case that needs low latency and the
   requirements for a framework to guarantee a service-level agreement
   (SLA) on latency for end-to-end data transmissions in a network
   slice.  Currently, several use cases have been discussed for network
   slices in the document [NetSlices-Usecase].  In addition, the
   architecture of network slices has been discussed in the document
   [NetSlices-Architecture].  In a network slice, specific resources
   such as a network, computing power, and storage are assigned
   exclusively to each user or service.  Therefore, it is natural for
   each user of a network slice to expect an SLA for the data
   transmission performance.

   Network slice schemes will be able to provide networks with low-
   latency data transmission.  With regard to low latency, deterministic
   networks have also been discussed as a means of supporting
   applications requiring extremely real-time data transmissions
   [DetNet-Architecture].  In order to contribute to an SLA for network
   slice schemes, a specific use case for DetNet is described in this
   draft.  In addition, requirements for controlling latency among
   multiple network domains are addressed.

   In Section 2, a use case requiring end-to-end latency management is
   described.  In Section 3, the problem of having to manage latency in
   order to transmit data through multiple domains is discussed.  In
   Section 4, example methods for managing latency are shown.  In
   Section 5, requirements that the management system should satisfy are
   described.

2.  Use Case Requiring Low Latency

   One use case requiring low-latency data transmission is the control
   of a vehicle from a remote control center.  In recent years,
   autonomous cars are being actively researched and developed.  Such
   cars will be able to drive without being controlled by a driver at
   almost all times.  However, in some cases, these cars might stop
   driving.  For example, when some of the sensors or cameras that
   detect the conditions of the car's surroundings are damaged, it will
   be difficult for the car to drive autonomously.  In such
   circumstances, the damaged vehicle could be controlled by a driver at
   a remote control center.  The driver would have to drive the damaged
   vehicle using the available sensors and monitors.  In order to
   control the vehicle safely, control data must be transmitted with low
   latency between the remote control center and the car.

3.  Problem Statement

   Currently, deterministic network architecture is being actively
   discussed.  Specifically, schemes to control latency among multiple
   network domains are being considered.  With regard to end-to-end
   latency control in network slicing, there will be two types of
   service.  One is the selection of a specific route that is able to
   meet the requirements of end-to-end latency.  The other is the
   assignment of consumable latency in each domain.  In the former case,
   a specific route could be selected by a single network management
   system.  In the latter case, consumable latency for each domain could
   be negotiated among multiple network-domain management systems.
   Another scheme may also be possible.  In order to manage end-to-end
   latency through multiple network domains, a common scheme is needed.

4.  Types of Latency Control

   With regard to controlling end-to-end latency, there are at least two
   types of scheme as described above.  One is based on centralized
   management and the other is based on distributed management.  In this
   section, those schemes are described in detail.

4.1.  Centralized Management Type

   An example system composed of a sender(Tx), receiver(Rx), multiple
   domains, sub-management systems, and a main management system is
   shown in Figure 1.  In this system, each sub-management system
   manages latency and specific routes in its respective domain.  In
   addition, each sub-management system measures the latency for
   possible data transmission paths.  In the figure, measured latency
   for each path between edges in each domain and for each connection
   between domains is shown.  The measurement results are transmitted to
   the main management system.  The main management system selects a
   specific route path between the sender and receiver to meet the
   latency requirement of the sender, and the selection results are
   transmitted to the sub-management systems.  They configure a data
   transmission path in their domain.

4.2.  Distributed management type

   An example system composed of a sender(Tx), receiver(Rx), multiple
   domains, and sub-management systems is shown in Figure 2.  In this
   system, each sub-management system manages latency and specific
   routes in its respective domain.  The sub-management system that
   receives a latency requirement for an end-to-end data transmission
   requests the other sub-management systems to return possible
   transmission latency between edges in the domain and between domains.
   The sub-management system selects a specific domain path between the
   sender and receiver to meet the latency requirement.  After that, the
   selection results are transmitted from the sub-management system to
   the other sub-management systems.  Specifically, the permitted
   latency for each domain is transmitted to each sub-management system.
   The selected sub-management system determines a specific route path

5.  Requirements for End-to-End Latency Management

   A framework for managing end-to-end data transmission latency must be
   designed.  In addition, the interfaces to gather latency information
   and configure data transmission paths must be prepared to control
   latency.  Specific requirements are briefly described below.

5.1.  Latency Management Framework

   As shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, there are at least two types of
   latency management.  One is to determine a specific data transmission
   path using a centralized management system.  The other is to
   determine a specific data transmission path using a distributed
   management system.  In order to efficiently manage latency, a common
   framework must be determined.

5.2.  Interface for Gathering Latency Information

   This interface is used to gather latency information for each domain.
   In the case of the centralized management system, the main management
   system uses the interface to gather latency information for each path
   between edges in each domain and for each connection between domains
   from all the sub-management systems.  In the case of the distributed
   management system, one sub-management system uses the interface to
   gather possible transmission latency information between edges in the
   domain and between domains from the other sub-management systems.

5.3.  Interface for configuring a Data Transmission Path

   This interface is used to configure an end-to-end data transmission
   path.  In the case of the centralized management system, the main
   management system uses the interface to transmit a selected data-
   transmission route path to the sub-management systems In the case of
   the distributed management system, one sub-management system uses the
   interface to transmit a selected data-transmission domain path to the
   other sub-management systems that provided possible transmission
   latency information between edges in each domain and between domains.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document describes a use case and requirements for latency
   management among multiple network domains.  A system to manage
   latency for end-to-end data transmissions could be composed of
   multiple sub-management systems for multiple domains.  In this
   system, latency information between edges in each domain is gathered
   or exchanged to determine a data-transmission route path or domain
   path.  It is therefore necessary to use a secure communication
   channel between the latency management systems.
