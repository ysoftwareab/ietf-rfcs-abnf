   Abstract 
        Mobile IP [1] agents are being deployed in enterprise networks, 
        to enable mobile users with network mobility across wired and 
        wireless LANs while roaming inside the enterprise firewall.  
        With the growing deployment of multi-subnetted IEEE 802.11 
        networks (referred as hot spots) in public places such as 
        hotels, airports, and convention centers, and wireless WAN data 
        networks such as GPRS, the need for enabling mobile users to 
        maintain their transport connections and constant reachability 
        while connecting back to their target ôhomeö networks protected 
        by Virtual Private Network (VPN) technology  is increasing.  
        This implies that Mobile IP and VPN  technologies have to 
        coexist  and  co-function  in  order  to  provide  mobility  and 
        security to the enterprise mobile users.  
         
        The goal of this  draft is threefold. The first is to describe 
        possible  deployment  scenarios  for  Mobile  IP  and  VPN  in 
        enterprise  and  operator  environments.    The  second  is  to 
        identify example usage scenarios for enterprise users roaming 
        outside the ôhomeö network (e.g., corporate Intranet), and 
        articulate  the  problems  resulting  from  Mobile  IP  and  VPN 
        coexistence.  The  third  is  to  specify  a  set  of  framework 
        requirements to evaluate proposed solutions, supporting multi-
        vendor seamless IPv4 mobility across IPsec-based VPN Gateways.  
        Hereafter, a ôVPNö term in this draft refers to an IPsec-based 
        VPN Gateway.

     This section describes possible deployment scenarios for Mobile IP 
     and VPN in enterprise and operator environments. In all scenarios, 
     Mobile IP and VPN have to coexist in order to provide mobility and 
     security to the mobile users roaming outside the Intranet.  Here, 
     the term ôIntranetö refers to a private network protected by a VPN 
     gateway.  The following sub-sections introduce four representative 
     combinations of  MIP HA and VPN placement. 
    
   2.1. VPN Gateway in DMZ and MIP HA(s) Inside the Intranet  
 
      This  can  be  considered  a  typical  deployment  scenario  in 
      enterprise environments with a large and growing number of mobile 
      users. 
 
      MN ---Foreign Network---Internet--FWùVPN--FWù-Intranet--- HA 
                                                                                      
 
   2.2. VPN Gateway and MIP HA(s) in DMZ 
    
      The MIP HA runs in parallel with the VPN Gateway, and it serves 
      mobile users roaming both inside and outside the Intranet.  This 
      type of deployment is more suitable for small or medium size 
      Intranets with a limited number of mobile users. 
        
      MN ---Foreign Network---InternetùFW----VPN---FW---Intranet 
                                          |      |   
                                          |--HA--| 
    
   2.3. Combined VPN Gateway and MIP HA in DMZ 
       
      This is similar to the deployment scenario described in section 
      2.2, with the exception that the VPN gateway and HA are running 
      on the same physical machine.  
    
      MN ---Foreign Network---InternetùFW----VPN/HA---FW---Intranet 
    
   2.4. VPN Gateway in DMZ And MIP HA(s) Outside the Intranet  
    
      This deployment scenario differs from ones previously mentioned 
      as the MIP HA(s) are deployed outside the Intranet (e.g., in an 
      operator environment).  
    
      MN ---Foreign Network--HA---Internetù-FW--VPNGW---FW---Intranet 
 
      For the remainder of this draft, we will only consider section 
      2.1 deployment scenario. This is because, section 2.2, 2.3, and 
      2.4 deployment scenarios do not introduce any problems resulting 
      from MIP and VPN coexistence.   
    
   3. Roaming Scenarios

        This  section  describes  roaming  scenarios  corresponding  to 
        section 2.1 wherein a mobile user roaming outside the firewall 
        needs to connect to his/her ôtargetö home network protected by 
        a VPN.  The scenarios are constructed based on a multi-
        subnetted MIPv4 enabled Intranet (hereafter, referred by Home 
        Network or VPN domain) protected by an IPsec-based VPN gateway 
        as depicted in Figure 3.0a.

        The home network, depicted in Figure 3.0a, may include both 
        wired (IEEE 802.3) and IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN deployments.  
        However, it is also possible to see IEEE 802.11 deployments 
        outside the home network due to the perceived lack of 802.1x 
        security, as depicted in Figure 3.0b.

        It is important to note that MIPv4 mobility agents inside the 
        home network are likely to be deployed in existing routers from 
        vendor X while VPN client/server solutions may come from vendor 
        Y and mobility clients (MN) may come from yet another vendor. 
        This is very typical as medium and large Enterprises purchase 
        and deploy best-of-breed multi-vendor solutions for IP routing, 
        VPNs, firewalls etc.

        To help describe scenarios in the following sections, we have 
        used the aid of an imaginary mobile user, called Dr. Joe. 
         
        Dr. Joe is a chief surgeon in a hospital, and always on the 
        move. He leverages his wireless MIPv4 enabled hand-held device 
        (MN) to access his patientÆs records, communicate with his 
        colleagues  and  staff,  and  stay  reachable  in  case  of  any 
        emergencies.  For clarity, we assume that Dr. JoeÆs hospital 
        employs a network similar to the one showed in Figure 4.0a 
        (MIPv4 enabled network protected by a VPN, and includes both 
        wired and IEEE 802.11 wireless deployments). 
         
   3.1. Accessing Services Inside the Home Network  
    
        Dr. JoeÆs needs for constant reachablity and maintaining his 
        current transport connections as he roams from one network link 
        to another are met by standard MIPv4 [1] deployment inside the 
        home network. 
 
   3.2. Accessing Services From Outside the Home Network  
 
        Dr. Joe frequently visits other clinics and hospitals, in which 
        a multi-subnetted IEEE 802.11 hot spot network is utilized to 
        provide Internet access for visitors.  Dr. Joe leverages the 
        hot spot network to connect to his home network, and he would 
        also like to maintain his transport connections to the home 
        network as he roams from one network link to another in the 
        visited network.   
 
        Dr. Joe has to perform both Mobile IP and IPsec functions in 
        order to establish a secure connection to his home network 
        while  maintaining  his  existing  transport  connections  and 
        constant reachability. This means that an IPsec tunnel MUST be 
        established between the MN and the VPN gateway, to allow secure 
        access  to  the  home  network.  And,  a  MIP  tunnel  MUST  be 
        established between the MN and its HA through a successful MIP 
        registration. The different MIP registration modes of the MN 
        are described in sections below. 
 
   3.2.1.       Operational Configurations 
 
   3.2.1.1. MN registers with its HA using co-located mode 
  
      This section illustrates a scenario where Dr. Joe registers with 
      its HA using co-located mode.  The IPsec tunnel end-points are MN 
      and the VPN gateway as depicted in the figure below.

   3.2.1.2. MN registers with its HA via a FA (non co-located mode) 
          
      This section describes a scenario where Dr. Joe registers with 
      its HA using a FA care-of address. And, there are 2 cases to 
      consider. 
          
         Case 1: 
         The FA is trusted, i.e. an SA has been established a priori 
         between the FA and the home VPN gateway, or a VPN-to-VPN 
         security scheme exists between a VPN GW located at the edge of 
         the foreign network and the IPSec-based VPN at the edge of the 
         home network.  In this case, the IPsec tunnel end-points are 
         the FA and home VPN gateway.  Furthermore, it is also possible 
         for the MN in a trusted FA region to have end-to-end security 
         with its home VPN gateway.  This implies that there will be 
         two concurrent IPsec tunnels, one between the FA and home VPN 
         gateway, and the other between the MN and its home VPN 
         gateway. Figure 3.2b shows the MN in a trusted FA region, 
         where there is only an IPsec tunnel between the FA and the

         Case2: 
         In a non-trusted FA region, i.e. where there is no SA between 
         the FA and the home VPN gateway, there will always be a single 
         IPsec tunnel established between the MN and its home VPN 
         gateway, as depicted in Figure 3.2c.

   4. Problem Statement 
         
        This section describes MIPv4 incompatibilities with IPsec-based 
        VPN gateways, in the context of the roaming scenarios outlined 
        in section 3. 
    
   4.1. MIPv4 Incompatibilities with IPsec-based VPN Gateways 
 
        The MN roaming outside the home network has to establish an 
        IPsec tunnel to its home VPN gateway first, in order to be able 
        to register with its home agent. This is because the MN cannot 
        reach its HA (inside the private protected network) directly 
        from outside. Figure 4.1a and 4.1b show the tunnel end-points 
        in non co-located and co-located modes respectively.

            MN [(========================) VPN ===========] HA 
 
            MN-CoA       VPN-E-Addr 
             (=============)                   IPsec ESP Tunnel 
                    
             MN-CoA         HA 
              [=============]                   MIP Tunnel 
 
        Figure 4.1a û Shows IPsec and MIP Tunnel end-points in   
                      co-located mode 
 
 
        This implies that the MIPv4 traffic from the MN to a node 
        inside the home network is forced to run inside an IPsec 
        tunnel, and hence will not be in the clear. This leads to the 
        following problems: 
 
        Problem 1: In non co-located mode, this implies that the FA 
        (which is likely in a different administrative domain) cannot 
        decrypt MIPv4 packets between the MN and the VPN gateway, and 
        will consequently be not able to relay the MIPv4 packets. This 
        is because the MIPv4 headers (that the FA can interpret) will 
        be encrypted and protected by IPSec. For example, the following 
        shows the MNÆs registration packet arrived at FA, which cannot 
        be decrypted by the FA. 
         
 
 
        +------------------------------------------------------------+ 
        |Src: MN HoA    |ESP   |Src: MN HoA|UDP     |Reg.   |ESP     | 
        |Dst: VPN_E_Addr|Header|Dst: HA    |Port 434|Request|Trailer | 
        +------------------------------------------------------------+  
         
        Problem 2: In co-located mode, the MN obtains a CoA at its 
        point of attachment (via DHCP[7] or some other means). In an 
        end-to-end security model, an IPsec tunnel that terminates at 
        the VPN gateway MUST protect the IP traffic originating at the 
        MN. If the IPsec tunnel is associated with the CoA, the tunnel 
        SA MUST be refreshed after each IP subnet handoff which could 
        have some performance implications on real-time applications. 
 
        It is important to note that the mobile node connecting to the 
        home network is forced to establish an IPsec tunnel SA to the 
        VPN gateway first.  And, this does NOT mean that this draft is 
        suggesting an ôIPsec over MIPö solution. 
         
   5. The Solution Requirements

Internet Draft  draft-ietf-mobileip-vpn-problem-statement-Req-00  July 
2002 
 
 
     This section describes the requirements that are intended to 
     establish a framework where in a solution can be developed to 
     support MIPv4 traversal across VPN gateways. 
 
   5.1. Implications of Intervening NAT Gateways 
      
      The solution MUST be able to leverage the resolution for MIPv4 
      traversal across NAT gateways provided in [11] to support MIPv4 
      traversal across ôNAT and VPNö scenario, in which MN has to 
      traverse one or more NAT gateway(s) followed by a VPN gateway in 
      the path to its final destination. 
 
   5.2. MIPv4 Protocol 
         
      - The solution MUST adhere to MIPv4 protocol [1].  That is, the 
      solution MUST NOT impose any changes that violates MIPv4 protocol 
      [1]. 
      - The solution MAY introduce new extensions to MIPv4 nodes per 
      guidelines specified in the MIPv4 protocol [1].  
      - The solution MAY introduce new extensions to MIPv4 nodes per 
      guidelines specified in the MIPv4 protocol [1].  However, it is 
      highly desirable to avoid any changes to MIPv4 mobility agents 
      such as the FA and HA in order to overcome barriers to 
      deployment. 
  
   5.3. Scalability, Availability, Reliability, and Performance 
    
   5.3.1. The solution complexity MUST increase at most linearly with 
   the number of MNs registered, and need to communicate with their 
   home network protected behind a VPN gateway. 
 
   5.3.2. The solution MAY introduce additional header or tunneling 
   overhead if needed.  However, the additional headers MUST be 
   reviewed by the design team. 
 
   5.4. Functional Entities 
         
      The solution MAY introduce a MIPv4 compliant functional entity 
      that helps MIPv4 traversal across VPN or the ôNAT and VPNö 
      gateways.  
 
 
   5.5. Fast MIPv4 Handoffs 
         
      It is imperative to keep the key management overhead down to a 
      minimum, in order to support fast handoffs across IP subnets. 
      Hence, the solution MUST propose a mechanism whereby the IPsec 
      tunnel SA need not to be renegotiated as the MN changes its 
      current point of network attachment. 
         
   5.6. Preservation of Existing VPN Infrastructure

      This implies the following: 
       
      - The solution MUST preserve the investment in existing VPN 
      gateways 
      - The solution MAY require software upgrades to VPN gateways to 
      explicitly support MIPv4 users 
        
      - The solution MUST preserves VPN security requirements that are 
      not inferior to what is already provided to existing "nomadic 
      computing" remote access users, i.e. for confidentiality, primary 
      and secondary authentication, message integrity, protection 
      against replay attacks and related security services. 
   
   5.7. Preserve Existing DMZ Traversal Policies 
         
      The solution MUST be compatible with existing DMZ policies with 
      respect to ACLs.  
    
   5.8. MIPv4 Registration SA Management 
    
      The solution MUST provide a mechanism for MIPv4 registration SA 
      management if needed. 
 
   5.9. Security Implications 
         
       The solution MUST NOT introduce any new vulnerabilities to the 
       MIPv4 protocol as specified in related RFCs.    
    
   6. MIPv6 Considerations 
         
        MIPv6 does not have a FA component, hence the MN will always 
        run in co-located mode.  This implies that only problem #2 
        specified  in  the  problem  statement  (section  6.1)  may 
        beapplicable to MIPv6.
