                 CoAP Option Extension : Response-Mode
               draft-li-core-coap-response-mode-option-00

Abstract

   CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes and
   networks.  Two response modes are defined: Piggy-backed Response and
   Separate Response.  This specification provides a simple extension
   for CoAP, to indicate in the request the required response mode, and
   also the required response time.

Note

   Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should
   be sent to core@ietf.org.

Internet-Draft          CoAP-Response-Mode-Option             March 2011


1.  Introduction

   This specification adds a new option Response-Mode to the CoAP.  The
   main purpose is for the requester to indicate the required response
   mode: Piggy-backed Response or Separate Response, and also indicate
   the required response time.

1.1.  Justification

   Currently in the CoAP specification [I-D.ietf-core-coap] , two
   response modes are defined:
   o  A Piggy-backed Response is included right in a CoAP
      Acknowledgement (ACK) message that is sent to acknowledge receipt
      of the Request for this Response.
   o  A Separate Response is sent later in a separate message exchange,
      when a Confirmable message carrying a Request is acknowledged with
      an empty message (e.g., because the server doesn't have the answer
      right away).

   Currently, it is the server's decision to choose a Piggy-backed
   Response or Separate Response for a request, also server does not
   know how long the requester will wait for the response.  It is
   possible that the server returns a Separate Response for a request,
   but the requester does not want to receive it because the requester
   has to send another acknowledgement if the Separate Response is a
   confirmable message.  The requester does not know how long it will
   take to get the response.  If the requester does not receive a
   response within an estimated time, retransmission mechanism will be
   used as indicated in section 4.1 of CoAP specification
   [I-D.ietf-core-coap].  This will waste the transmission resource for
   the requester to repeat sending the requests.  Also it is possible
   that the response exceeds the timeout set by the requester, in this
   case, the response will be rejected by the requester and the
   transmission resource and server's processing resource are wasted.

   A possible use case is that a sensor might send information and then
   quickly power down, and it can only receive the response during the
   time before it powers down.  The requester should control whether the
   server is allowed to send a Separate (not Piggy-backed) response.
   The impact is whether a requester must include the capability of
   responding to requests (rather than just accepting a response to a
   request it sent): if so, the requester may need more code/memory to
   support multiple active transactions and processing incoming
   requests, and has to stay awake for longer periods.

   It is useful for the requester to indicate that it is willing to
   accept a Separate Response or only a Piggy-backed Response can be
   accepted.  With this, the server can generate response according to

   the indication in the request, and avoid the situation that the
   server may waste resources preparing and sending a response the
   requester will not be able to process.

   It is also useful for the requester to indicate that the response is
   required to be returned within a certain amount of time, for example,
   please respond within 2 seconds.  This applies to both Piggy-backed
   Response and Separate Response.  With this, the requester can keep
   the state of the request only for the indicate time.  After this
   period, the request will be given up.  In this way, the transmission
   resource can be saved to avoid the retransmission of requests. does
   not know how long should wait for the response Also it can avoid the
   situation that a server may waste resources sending a response which
   already exceeds the set timeout of the requester.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Response-Mode Option Extension

2.1.  Response-Mode Option Definition


         +------+-----+----------------+-----------+--------+----------+
         | Type | C/E |      Name      | Data type | Length | Default  |
         +------+-----+----------------+-----------+--------+----------+
         |  16  | E   | Response-Mode  |   uint    | 0-1 B  |          |
         +------+-----+----------------+-----------+--------+----------+


              0
              0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
             +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
             |P|       T     |
             +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Piggy-backed.  If unset, indicates that a Separate Response MAY be
   accepted.  If set to "1", indicates that a Piggy-backed Response MUST
   be returned.

   Time.  Indicates the required response time is 2^T milliseconds.  The
   server MUST return the response within the indicated response time.
   Otherwise, the response will be considered as timeout.  As there are
   seven bits available for T, the minimum response time is 2^0 = 1

   millisecond and the maximum is 2^(2^7-1) = 2^127 milliseconds.

2.2.  Using the Response-Mode Option

   This option is used for the requester to indicate the required
   response mode and the required response time.

   If a Separate Response is desired by the requester, the Token option
   SHOULD be included in the request.

   If this option is present in the request, and the length is 0 bytes,
   that is, no option value, that means, a Separate Response MAY be
   accepted, and the default SEPARATE_RESPONSE_TIME (2^16=65536
   milliseconds are defined in this document) is required.

   If this option is absent in the request, it is the server's decision
   to choose a Piggy-backed Response or a Separate Response.  The
   requester and the server will act according to section 4.1 in CoAP
   specification [I-D.ietf-core-coap].

   If the requester does not receive a response within the indicated
   response time, the requester can consider the request as failed.

   If the server can't provide response within the required time, a 5.00
   (Internal Server Error) [TBD] MUST be returned.

   This option is not used in the response.

   This option is "elective".  It MUST NOT occur more than once.


3.  Examples

   This section gives a number of short examples with message flows to
   illustrate the use of Response-Mode option in GET request.

   The first example (Figure 1) shows that the requester wants to get a
   Piggy-backed Response within 2048 milliseconds.
