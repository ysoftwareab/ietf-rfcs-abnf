Abstract

   This document introduces a new document series called Set of RFC
   Documents (SRDs).  SRDs will be distinguished by names and serial
   numbers.  SRDs contain Extensible Markup Language (XML) which can
   automatically produce HTML and plaintext versions for human
   consumption

   With many RFC being updated, this creates difficulty when determining

   which RFCs are necessary as references when implementing or using
   protocols.  Grouping RFC into sets that embody a specific endeavour
   would permit stable references for those interested in discovering
   related details.  The SRD name may also serve as a reference for
   topical information stored in a database that is made available.

Internet-Draft                     SRD                    September 2005


1.  Introduction

   It is becoming increasingly difficult to determine which RFCs are
   necessary as references when implementing or using protocols.  The
   STD series defined in [RFC1311] is a guide, but often fails to list
   all the necessary RFCs.  The Maturity Levels defined in [RFC2026] are
   increasingly confusing the picture by the need to update higher
   maturity documents with lower maturity revisions.  It is hoped that
   by providing a coherent organization using sets of documents, along
   with relevant inter-operational information contained within a
   separate database, an easier-to-use alternative can be introduced.
   If this SRD strategy proves untenable or unuseful, it can be dropped,
   as it makes no other changes to current procedures.

   This document proposes developing an Extensible Markup Language (XML)
   structure to define a set of RFCs related to a specific endeavour.
   The set SHOULD NOT encompass diverse applications which utilize a
   broad range of separable functions.  The intent of this document is
   to provide an optimal means for locating relevant information made
   increasingly difficult by a growing number or RFCs, updates, and
   corrections.  The eventual expectation might be that any RFC not
   found within some SRD is not relevant to any current endeavour.

2.  SRD Identification and References

   This document proposes a new document series called Set of RFC
   Documents ("SRD").  These documents contain Extensible Markup
   Language [W3C.REC-xml-20040204] structures used for generating
   outputs such as HTML, RSS, and plain-text outputs that link together
   the related RFCs.  The SRD documents would be managed under the
   direction of the IESG, which may also establish procedures for
   updating the relevant topical information stored in a database that
   might also include overview of the RFC Editor's Errata database.

   The SRD is identified by a combination of name and number in the form
   of {srd-name.serial-number}.  The name for each SRD is unique.  Any
   references to an SRD within an SRD MUST include the serial-number.
   The initial SRD document serial-number starts at 0.  As a general
   rule, when an HTML or database link excludes the serial, version, or
   iteration number, through the use of scripts, it will automatically
   reference the current document.  This auto-generated link is to
   simplify link maintenance and to stabilize the SRD structures.

3.  SRD Development

   This document also proposes a version of the SRDs be used in the
   initial development process, to allow an overview of Work-In-Progess,
   WIP, which may involve an extended work and approval time period.

Internet-Draft                     SRD                    September 2005


   The WIP SRD is identified by a prefix added which does not interfere
   with automatic linking.  The prefix used for an SRD, while it is
   being modified, would be:

       {'X'<iteration-number>'-'<group-identifier>'-'}

   The group-identifier is an alpha-numeric string that represents a
   group identifier or possibly the name of an individual.  If this
   document was modifying {foobar.1} by the working group 'newtrk', the
   first iteration would be:

       X0-newtrk-foobar.1

   When the document becomes accepted at some point, it would become
   {foobar.2}.  The group identifier permits simultaneous WIP SRD
   documents to be pending for approval.

   Normally, an SRD is not allowed to reference an Internet-Draft, but
   there would be an exception made for a WIP SRD.  The WIP SRD can not
   receive approval until all referenced Internet-Drafts have also been
   accepted and replaced as RFCs.

   During the introduction of SRDs, inclusion of a WIP SRD with an I-D
   submission is optional.  The IESG should provide for a person to
   review necessary changes to SRDs.  By default, this might be the
   appropriate Area Director.  At some point, inclusion of the WIP SRD
   could be mandated by the IESG.  The Area Director would then ensure
   the WIP version of all affected SRD documents accompany an Internet-
   Draft submitted to the Area Director for IESG action.  The WIP SRD
   and the Internet-Draft would be considered together through all
   review stages.  Of course, all referenced Internet-Draft acceptance
   MUST precede WIP SRD acceptance.

4.  XML Conversion Considerations

   XML and XSLT structures are used to create HTML, RSS, and Plain-Text
   outputs for establishing stable hyper-link references.  When there
   are empty or missing elements within the SRD document, those elements
   would be excluded from the HTML page as well.  The intent is to
   ensure a minimum amount of information is presented.  To selectively
   include the Errata Database links, the related pages would then need
   to be regenerated when Errata is subsequently established for an RFC.

   Writing an SRD document from scratch would follow a process similar
   to that described in [RFC2629] for use of the XML-to-RFC tool.  The
   SRD XML declaration begins with a reference to the DTD, XSLT
   [W3C.REC-xslt-19991116], processing options, and the "srd" element:

Internet-Draft                     SRD                    September 2005


       <?xml version='1.0' encoding="UTF-8"?>
       <!DOCTYPE srd  SYSTEM "rfcxxxx.dtd" >
       <?xml-stylesheet type='text/xsl'href='rfcxxxx.xslt' ?>
       <?srd sortrefs="yes" ?>
       <?srd strict="yes" ?>
       <srd ... >
         ...
       </srd>

   The lines preceding the <srd ...> should be the same for all SRDs and
   nothing should follow the ending "</srd>" tag.  Make sure that all
   elements are properly matched and nested.

5.  The srd element

   The "srd" attribute included within the "<srd ...>" tag at the
   beginning of the document determines the name and serial number of
   the SRD output.  If a "wip" attribute is included, this produces a
   WIP SRD that may include references to Internet-Drafts.  When this
   "wip" attribute is removed and the serial number is advanced, a final
   SRD document is then produced.  Although SRD serial numbers start at
   the value of 0, approved SRDs serial numbers will be 1 or greater.

   Example of srd attributes declaring both base document and the group
   making changes:

       <srd set="foobar.2" wip="0-newtrk">

   The "set" attribute MUST be present and indicates both the set name
   and version.  The "wip" attribute is optional, and specifies both the
   WIP iteration and the name of the group or person making a change.

   The srd information includes a sequence of elements being the title,
   description, srdDate, core, extensions, guidance, replaces,
   experimental, and companion.  The topical information database may
   provide a reference to an accountable entity for the SRD, where this
   is not included within the srd itself.

   Example of srd content:

       <title>XML SRD</title>
       <description>XML structure for example SRDs.</description>
       <srdDate>2005-07-16</srdDate>
       <core>
         <srdref>reference.RFC.9876</srdref>
         <srdref>reference.RFC.9875</srdref>
       </core>
       <extensions>
         <srdref>reference.RFC.9912</srdref>
       </extensions>
       <guidance>
         <srdref>reference.RFC.9915</srdref>
       </guidance>
       <replaces>
         <srdref>reference.RFC.9811</srdref>
       </replaces>
       <experimental>
         <srdref>reference.RFC.9837</srdref>
       </experimental>
       <companion>
         <srdref>reference.SRD.example.1</srdref>
       </companion>


6.  The srdref element

   The srdref element includes references that take the form:

       reference.<Document Type>.<Document Designator>

   The Document Types are RFC, I-D, and SRD for RFCs, Internet-drafts
   and SRDs respectively.

7.  The title element

       <title>
         Title describes the entire RFC set.
       </title>

   The title element represents the title for the entire SRD set.  This
   supplements the simple label defined by the "set=" attribute which is
   used as the set reference.

8.  The description element

        <description>
          Description more fully describes the entire RFC set.
        </description>

   The description should be no more than a few sentences describing the
   SRD.

9.  The srdDate element

       <srdDate>
         YYYY-MM-DD
       </srdDate>

   The srdDate element provides the date when the SRD was published.
   The format for the date is specified as a complete date as specified
   in Date and Time Formats [W3C.NOTE-datetime-19980827].  The 'YYYY'
   represents the year.  The 'MM' represents the numeric month.  The
   'DD' represents the numeric day.

10.  The core element

       <core>
         <srdref>reference.RFC.9876</srdref>
         <srdref>reference.RFC.9875</srdref>
       </core>

   The core element contains srdref elements that reference RFCs or I-Ds
   that encompass the definitions related to a specific endeavour.  For
   WIP SRDs, a reference to an Internet-Draft would take the form:

       <srdref>reference.I-D.housley-binarytime</srdref>


11.  The extensions element

       <extensions>
         <srdref>reference.RFC.9912</srdref>
       </extensions>

   The extensions element contains srdref elements that reference RFCs
   or I-Ds that encompass the definitions of optional enhancements to
   the basic definitions.  Extension RFCs do not describe a separate
   endeavour, but are not an essential component of the endeavour
   encompassed by the SRD.

12.  The guidance element

       <guidance>
          <srdref>reference.RFC.9815</srdref>
       </guidance>

   The guidance element contains srdref elements that reference RFCs or
   I-Ds that encompass the definitions of advice related to the
   deployment of the RFCs within the set.

13.  The replaces element

      <replaces>
        <srdref>reference.RFC.9811</srdref>
      </replaces>

   The replaces element contains srdref elements that reference RFCs,
   I-Ds, or SRDs that encompass the definitions that have been updated
   or obsoleted and are no longer directly relevant except as a
   reference to the prior definitions.

14.  The experimental element

       <experimental>
         <srdref>reference.RFC.9811</srdref>
       </experimental>

   The experimental element contains srdref elements that reference RFCs
   or I-Ds that encompass the definitions which are deemed experimental
   and relate to either core or extension RFCs.

15.  The companion element

       <companion>
         <srdref>reference.SRD.srd-example.1</srdref>
       </companion>

   The companion element contains srdref elements that reference SRDs
   that encompass closely related endeavours, but which are not needed
   by other elements of the SRD.  The intent of the companion element is
   to assist those attempting to locate definitions for a comprehensive
   application which typically includes these closely related
   endeavours.

16.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations in this draft.

17.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies an administrative procedure for the IETF and
   hence does not raise any new issues about the security of the
   Internet.  However, the availability of the type of document
   described here may provide a convenient mechanism and repository of
   vulnerabilities and other issues that are discovered after RFCs are
   issued, but that do not justify updating (or for which resources are
   not available to update) the relevant RFC.  Having an obvious place
   to look for those notifications and discussions for relevant
   documents might enhance overall security somewhat.
