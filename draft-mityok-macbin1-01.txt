1. Abstract

This draft is a targeted at the Macintosh Internet users to adopt the
MacBinary II form of Macintosh file encoding for use on FTP sites as an 
alternative to BinHexing Macintosh files.

The current standard file encoding method for Macintosh files placed on
Internet FTP sites is BinHexing. The process converts binary data into a
coded-text based format. While very popular and widely used this process
increases the files size dramatically.

For example a self-extracting archive that is 389,089 byte in size will
swell to 535,944 bytes after being BinHexed. The resulting file is nearly
30% larger than its original version. This process is completely wasteful
and totally unnecessary for FTP transfers.

2. Purpose of this draft

The increases in BinHex file sizes translates into larger hard disk
requirements, increased load placed on FTP servers and longer download
times. Users on PPP or SLIP accounts can use modem-based data compression
to increase bandwidth, but with multi-meg downloads the benefits are
negligible.

I suggest the Macintosh community on the Internet adopt the MacBinary II
form of file encoding as the standard format for FTP file transfers.

The MacBinary II format combines the two parts of a Macintosh file, the
resource and the data fork, into one data file. An additional 128
bytes are added as a data file header in the process. The addition of
128 bytes is the only increase in the files overall size.

          Adopt MacBinary II Mac File Encoding for FTP Transfers
                            draft-macbin2.txt

The resulting file can be transferred to non-Macintosh computer systems
without the loss of Mac-header or resource fork information. MacBinary
is not a transfer protocol like Xmodem, Kermit, or Zmodem. Instead, it
is used in conjunction with a transfer protocol, however it is
independent of that protocol.

A file that is 389,89 bytes in size is only 389,244 bytes after being
MacBinarized. The total increase of file size is completely unnoticed by
the user.

The majority of currently available Macintosh Internet software is capable
of either recognizing or decoding a MacBinary file including Netscape,
Internet Explorer, Ircle v2.5 and Fetch v3.0. A non-Internet program
capable of handling a MacBinary file is StuffIt Expander from Aladdin
Systems.

Most notably in the list is Fetch for FTP file transfers. Fetch comes
pre-configured to decode MacBinary files as they are downloaded from FTP
sites. Fetch can also upload a standard Macintosh file and MacBinarize
it while uploading. This eliminates a secondary process of encoding 
before uploading as with BinHexing.

Since so many existing Internet programs can handle this type of file it
would seem logical to take advantage of the hard disk and bandwidth 
savings
of using MacBinary II file encoding for Macintosh files for FTP transfers.
