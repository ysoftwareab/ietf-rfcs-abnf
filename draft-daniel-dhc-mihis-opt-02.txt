Abstract

   In IEEE 802 Standard, the Media Independent Handover (MIH) Services
   are under work through IEEE 802.21 Working Group.  It is consist of
   three services, Media Independent Event Service (MIES), Media
   Independent Command Service (MICS) and Media Independent Information
   Service (MIIS).  This document provides a mechanism by which the DHCP
   can provide information about the MIIS Discovery Information.

1.  Introduction

   In IEEE 802 Standard, the Media Independent Handover Services are
   under work through IEEE 802.21 Working Group.  It is consist of three
   services, Media Independent Event Service (MIES), Media Independent
   Command Service (MICS) and Media Independent Information Service
   (MIIS).

   MIIS provides a framework by which a MIH function both in the mobile
   node and in the network can discover and obtain homogeneous and
   heterogeneous network information within a geographical area to
   facilitate handovers.  In the larger scope, the macro objective is to
   acquire a global view of the heterogeneous networks to facilitate
   seamless handovers when roaming across these networks.  MIIS includes
   support for various Information Elements (IEs) stored in Information
   Server (IS).  IEs provide information that is essential for a
   handover module to make intelligent handover decision.  Figure 1
   gives a high level description of scenario that distinguish between
   two different types of mobility as Horizontal Handovers and Vertical
   Handovers.

   Depending on the type of mobility support for different types of
   information elements may be necessary for performing handovers.

   MIIS provides the capability for obtaining the necessary information
   for handovers.  This includes information about lower layers such as
   neighbor maps and other link layer parameters as well as information
   about available higher layer services such as access to internet
   connectivity, availability of VPN services, etc.  The set of
   different higher services privided by the MIIS may constantly evolve.
   At the same time, the list of access networks that are supported by
   MIIS may also evolve.

   A schema defines structure of information.  A schema is used in the
   802.21 information service to define the structure of each
   information element as well as the relationship among different
   information elements supported.  A schema is defined by a language
   and may be represented in multiple ways.  Examples include Resource
   Description Framework (RDF) which is based on XML which is used in
   802 MIBs, Variants or a simple TLV representation of different
   information elements.  The MIIS schema is classified into two major
   categories.

   - Basic schema that is essential for every MIH to support and

   - Extended schema that is optional and can be vendor specific

   Note: further details are described in [ieee80221].

   This document defines new DHCPv4[RFC2131] and DHCPv6 [RFC3315]
   options as MIIS Discovery Option for discovering MIIS Information.

2.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  MIIS Discovery Information

   The following information is defined as MIIS Discovery Information.

   o A list of IP addresses of MIIS Information Servers.  This
   information is used by an MIIS client on a host to communicate with
   MIIS Information Servers using an MIIS transport protocol.  (Note: an

   MIIS transport protocol is being defined in MIPSHOP WG)

   o An URL of an extended schema.  This information is used by an MIIS
   client on a host to obtain an extended schema that is located at a
   specified URL.  The extended schema may be stored in a node that is
   not acting as an MIIS Information Server.  The MIIS client needs to
   know the URL of the extended schema regardless of whether the
   extended schema is stored in an MIIS Information Server or not.

   o An DHCP option for a schema URL is needed for an extended schema
   only.  for the basic schema, an IANA-assigned persistent URL will be
   used and the URL is supposed to be pre-configured in an MIIS client
   on a host, thus an DHCP option for a basic schema URL is not needed.

4.  MIIS Discovery Option

   This option specifies the MIIS Discovery Information that client
   should use when discovering the handover information of MIIS somehow
   via the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol [RFC2131].

4.1  MIIS Information Server IPv4 Address Option for DHCPv4

   The DHCPv4 format of the MIIS Information Server IPv4 Address Option
   is shown as follows;



    0                   1

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |             ...               |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+



   The option-code for this option is TBD.  The length of this option
   MUST be a multiple of 4.

   Information Server IPv4 Address field contains an IPv4 address of a
   MIIS Information Server.  In a single Information Server IPv4 Address
   case, the length is 4.  if multiple addresses are in use, the
   Information Servers are listed in the order of preference.

   A DHCPv4 client requests the MIIS Information Server IPv4 Address
   Option in a Parameter Request List as described in [RFC2131] and
   [RFC2132].

   The DHCPv4 client MUST try the records in the order listed in the
   MIIS Information Server IPv4 Address option.

4.2  MIIS Extended Schema URL Option for DHCPv4

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+



   The option-code for this option is TBD.  The length of this option is
   variable.

   MIIS Extended Schema URL field contains one URL of IEEE 802.21
   Information Service Schema where the resource represented by the URL
   is an Extended Schema [ieee80221].  The length of option is variable.

   A DHCPv4 client requests the MIIS Extended Schema URL Option in a
   Parameter Request List as described in [RFC2131] and [RFC2132].

4.3  MIIS Information Server IPv6 Address Option for DHCPv6

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+



   The option-code for this option is TBD.  The length of this option
   MUST be a multiple of 16.

   Information Server IPv6 Address field contains an IPv6 address of a
   Information Server.  In a single Information Server IPv6 Address
   case, the length is 16.  if multiple addresses are in use, the
   Information Servers are listed in the order of preference.

   A DHCPv6 client requests the MIIS Information Server IPv6 Address
   Option in an Option Request Option as described in [RFC3315].

   The DHCPv6 client MUST try the records in the order listed in the
   MIIS Information Server IPv6 Address option.

4.4  MIIS Extended Schema URL Option for DHCPv6

   The option-code for this option is TBD.  The length of this option is

   MIIS Extended Schema URL field contains one URL of IEEE 802.21
   Information Service Schema where the resource represented by the URL
   is an Extended Schema [ieee80221].  The length of option is variable.

   A DHCPv6 client requests the MIIS Extended Schema URL Option in an
   Options Request Option as described in [RFC3315].

5.  Security Considerations

   A rogue DHCP server can issue invalid or incorrect MIIS Discovery
   Information.  This may cause denial of service due to unreachability
   or makes the client to reach incorrect destination.

   In case of DHCPv4, the authenticated DHCP [RFC3118] can be also used
   for secure exchange between clients and MIIS Information Server
   locations.

   In case of DHCPv6, the security considerations are described in
   Section 23 of [RFC3315].

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign values for the MIIS Discovery Option code
   - MIIS Information Server IPv4 Address Option for DHCPv4, MIIS
   Extended Schema URL Option for DHCPv4, MIIS Information Server IPv6
   Address Option for DHCPv6, MIIS Extended Schema URL Option for DHCPv6
   - in accordance with [RFC2939].
