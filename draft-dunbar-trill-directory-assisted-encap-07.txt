1. Introduction

   This draft describes how data center network can benefit from
   non-RBridge nodes performing TRILL encapsulation with
   assistance from directory service.

   [RFC7067] describes the framework for RBridge edge to get
   MAC&VLAN<->RBridgeEdge mapping from a directory service in
   data center environment instead of flooding unknown DAs across
   TRILL domain. When directory is used, any node, even a non-
   RBridge node, can perform the TRILL encapsulation. This draft
   is to describe the benefits and the scheme of non-RBridge
   nodes performing TRILL encapsulation.

   TRILL-EN: TRILL Encapsulating node. It is a node that only
            performs the TRILL encapsulation but doesn't
            participate in RBridge's IS-IS routing.

3. Directory Assistance to Non-RBridge

   With directory assistance [RFC7067], a non-RBridge can be
   informed if a packet needs to be forwarded across the RBridge
   domain and the corresponding egress RBridge. Suppose the
   RBridge domain boundary starts at network switches (not
   virtual switches embedded on servers), a directory can assist
   Virtual Switches embedded on servers to encapsulate with a
   proper TRILL header by providing the nickname of the egress
   RBridge edge to which the target is attached. The other
   information needed to encapsulate can be either learned by
   listening to TRILL Hellos, which will indicate the MAC address
   and nickname of appropriate edge RBridges, or by
   configuration.

   If a target is not attached to other RBridge edge nodes based
   on the directory [RFC7067], the non-RBridge node can forward
   the data frames natively, i.e. not encapsulating any TRILL
   header.

   When a TRILL encapsulated data packet reaches the ingress
   RBridge, the ingress RBridge can simply forward the pre-
   encapsulated packet to the RBridge that is specified by the
   egress nickname field of the TRILL header of the data frame.
   When the ingress RBridge receives a native Ethernet frame, it
   handles it as usual and may drop it if it has complete directory
   information indicating that the target is not attached to the TRILL
   campus.

   In this environment with complete directory information, the
   ingress RBridge doesn't flood or send the received Ethernet
   data frames to TRILL domain when the DA in the Ethernet data
   frames is unknown.

   When all attached nodes to ingress RBridge can pre-encapsulate
   TRILL header for traffic across the TRILL domain, the ingress
   RBridge don't need to encapsulate any native Ethernet frames
   to the TRILL domain. All native Ethernet frames are switched
   by the attached bridged LAN per IEEE802.1Q.  Under this
   environment, there is no need to designate AF ports and all
   RBridge edge ports connected to one bridged LAN can receive
   and forward pre-encapsulated traffic, which can greatly
   improve the overall network utilization.

   Note: [RFC6325] Section 4.6.2 Bullet 8 specifies that an
   RBridge port can be configured to accept TRILL encapsulated
   frames from a neighbor that is not an RBridge.

   When a TRILL frame arrives at an RBridge whose nickname
   matches with the destination nickname in the TRILL header of
   the frame, the processing is exactly same as normal, i.e. the
   RBridge decapsulates the received TRILL frame and forwards the
   decapsulated Ethernet frame to the target attached to its edge
   ports. When the DA of the decapsulated Ethernet frame is not
   in the egress RBridge's local MAC attachment tables, the
   egress RBridge can flood the decapsulated Ethernet frame to
   all hosts attached or drop the frame (if the egress RBridge is
   configured with the policy).

   We call a node that only performs the TRILL encapsulation but
   doesn't participate in RBridge's IS-IS routing a TRILL
   Encapsulating node (TRILL-EN). The TRILL Encapsulating Node
   can get the MAC&VLAN<->RBridgeEdge mapping table pulled from
   directory servers [RFC7067].

   Editor's note: RFC7067 has defined Push and Pull model for
   edge nodes to get directory mapping information. While Pull
   Model is relative simple for TRILL-EN to implement, Pushing
   requires some reliable flooding mechanism, like the one used
   by IS-IS, between the edge RBridge and the TRILL encapsulating
   node. Something like an extension to ES-IS might be needed.

   Upon receiving a native Ethernet frame, the TRILL-EN checks
   the MAC&VLAN<->RBridgeEdge mapping table, and perform the
   corresponding TRILL encapsulation if the entry is found in the
   mapping table. If the destination address and VLAN of the
   received Ethernet frame doesn't exist in the mapping table and
   no positive reply from pulling request to a directory, the
   Ethernet frame is dropped or forwarded per IEEE802.1Q.

4. Source Nickname in Frames Encapsulated by Non-RBridge
   Nodes

   The TRILL header includes a Source RBridge's Nickname
   (ingress) and Destination RBridge's Nickname (egress). When a
   TRILL header is added by TRILL-EN, the Ingress RBridge edge
   node's nickname is used in the source address field.

5. Benefits of Non-RBridge encapsulating TRILL header

5.1. Avoid Nickname Exhaustion Issue

   For a large Data Center with hundreds of thousands of
   virtualized servers, setting TRILL boundary at the servers'
   virtual switches will create a TRILL domain with hundreds of
   thousands of RBridge nodes, which has issues of TRILL
   Nicknames exhaustion and challenges to IS-IS. Setting TRILL
   boundary at aggregation switches that have many virtualized
   servers attached can limit the number of RBridge nodes in a
   TRILL domain, but introduce the issues of very large
   MAC&VLAN<->RBridgeEdge mapping table to be maintained by
   RBridge edge nodes and the necessity of enforcing AF ports.

   Allowing Non-RBridge nodes to pre-encapsulate data frames with
   TRILL header makes it possible to have a TRILL domain with
   reasonable number of RBridge nodes in a large data center. All
   the TRILL-ENs attached to one RBridge are represented by one
   TRILL nickname, which can avoid the Nickname exhaustion
   problem.

5.2. Reduce MAC Tables for switches on Bridged LANs

   When hosts in a VLAN (or subnet) span across multiple RBridge
   edge nodes and each RBridge edge has multiple VLANs enabled,
   the switches on the bridged LANs attached to the RBridge edge
   are exposed to all MAC addresses among all the VLANs enabled.

   For example, for an Access switch with 40 physical servers
   attached, where each server has 100 VMs, there are 4000 hosts
   under the Access Switch. If indeed hosts/VMs can be moved
   anywhere, the worst case for the Access Switch is when all
   those 4000 VMs belong to different VLANs, i.e. the access
   switch has 4000 VLANs enabled. If each VLAN has 200 hosts,
   this access switch's MAC table potentially has 200*4000 =
   800,000 entries.

   If the virtual switches on server pre-encapsulate the data
   frames towards hosts attached to other RBridge Edge nodes with
   TRILL header, the outer MAC DA of those TRILL encapsulated
   data frames will be the MAC address of the local RBridge edge,
   i.e. the ingress RBridge. Therefore, the switches on the local
   bridged LAN don't need to keep the MAC entries for remote
   hosts attached to other RBridge edges.

   But the traffic from nodes attached to other RBridges is
   decapsulated and has the true source and destination MACs. To
   prevent local bridges from learning remote hosts' MACs and
   adding to their MAC tables, one simple way is to disable
   learning on local bridges. The local bridges can be pre-
   installed with MAC addresses of local hosts with the
   assistance of directory. The local bridges can always send
   frames with unknown Destination to the ingress RBridge. In an
   environment where end stations are VMs embedded in a server,
   the amount of remote MAC addresses could be very large. If it
   is not feasible to disable learning and pre-install MAC tables
   for local bridges, one effective method to minimize local
   bridges' MAC table size is to use the server's MAC address to
   hide MAC addresses of the attached VMs. I.e. the server acting
   as an edge node using its own MAC address in the Source
   Address field of the packets originated from a host (or VM)
   embedded. When the Ethernet frame arrives at the target edge
   node (the server), the target edge node can send the packet to
   the corresponding destination host based on the packet's IP
   address. Very often, the target edge node communicates with
   the embedded VMs via a layer 2 virtual switch. Under this
   case, the target edge node can construct the proper Ethernet
   header with the assistance from directory. The information
   from directory includes the proper host IP to MAC mapping
   information.



6. Conclusion and Recommendation

   When directory information is available, nodes outside TRILL
   domain become capable of encapsulating TRILL header for data
   frames destined for remote RBridges that are not on the same
   bridged LAN. The non-RBridge encapsulation approach is
   especially useful when there are a large number of servers in
   a data center equipped with hypervisor-based virtual switches.
   It is relatively easy for virtual switches, which are usually
   software based, to get directory assistance and perform
   network address encapsulation.



7. Manageability Considerations

   It requires directory assistance to make it possible for a
   non-TRILL node to pre-encapsulate packets destined towards
   remote RBridges.

8. Security Considerations

   Pull Directory queries and responses are transmitted as
   RBridge-to-RBridge or native RBridge Channel messages. Such
   messages can besecured as specified in [ChannelTunnel].
