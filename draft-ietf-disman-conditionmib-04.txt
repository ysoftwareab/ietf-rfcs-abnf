2.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   0    An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

   0    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC
        1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described
        in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and
        STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

   0    Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of
        the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the
        message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906
        [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

   0    Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of
        protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
        RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

   o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
        in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine-readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in 
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine 
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the 
   MIB.


3. Introduction

   The scope of this MIB is targeted for network operators responsible 
   for managing the operations of network resources. This document contains 
   an alarm reporting control (ARC) MIB module, which provides a mechanism for 
   a manager to suppress or defer the reporting of alarm conditions based 
   on the resource ID and alarm condition type.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


4.  ARC MIB Overview

   There is a need to provide a mechanism for controlling the reporting 
   of alarm conditions of resources in a network device. For example, 
   (a) inhibiting the reporting of alarm conditions of a resource until 
   the resource is problem-free, (b) inhibiting the reporting of alarm 
   conditions of a resource for a specified time period, or 
   (c) inhibiting the reporting of alarm conditions of a resource 
   indefinitely until explicitly allowed by the managing system at a later
   time. 

   The alarm reporting control (ARC) feature provides an automatic 
   in-service provisioning capability. It allows sufficient time for 
   service setup, customer testing, and other maintenance activities in 
   an "alarm-free" state. Once a resource is "problem-free", 
   alarm reporting can be automatically or manually turned on 
   (i.e., allowed).

   By putting a network resource in ARC mode, (i.e., in NALM, NALM-TI, 
   NALM-QI, or NALM-QI-CD states, as described in the MIB), the technicians  
   and managing systems will not be flooded with unnecessary work items 
   during operations activities such as service provisioning and 
   network setup/teardown. This will reduce maintenance costs and 
   improve the operation and maintenance of these systems.
   Putting a network resource in ARC mode shall not affect the 
   availability of active alarm condition information for potential
   retrieval.

   ITU-T Recommendation M.3100 Amendment 3 [M.3100 Amd3] provides the 
   business requirements, analysis, and design of the Alarm Reporting 
   Control Feature. 

   This document defines the SNMP objects to support a subset of 
   the ARC functions described in M.3100 Amd3. In particular, it defines
   a table that can be used to specify the ARC setting for the resources 
   in a system.

   Specification of objects for defining and storing alarms, including 
   active and history alarms, standing and transient alarms, are outside
   the scope of this document. However, the probable causes listed in
   IANAItuProbableCause of the ITU Alarm MIB are used by the ARC mib 
   for specifying alarm condition types of the ARC settings.

4.1 Relationship between ARC mode and alarm reporting

   When the ARC mib is used in a managed system, the following rules
   apply:

   For alarm condition raised prior to entering ARC mode, reporting 
   of alarm raised and alarm cleared will be sent as usual. 
	
   For alarm condition raised after entering ARC mode and also 
   cleared before exiting ARC mode, no reporting of alarm raised will 
   be sent and no reporting of alarm cleared will be sent.

   For alarm condition raised after entering ARC mode and not cleared 
   when exiting ARC mode, the reporting of alarm raised will be 
   deferred until the moment of exiting ARC mode. The reporting of 
   alarm cleared will be sent as usual (i.e., at the time of alarm 
   cleared).

   Further details of the ARC function can be found in M.3100 Amd3.

4.2 This document requires the allocation of a single object identifier
   beneath the mib-2 subtree for its module identity.

  DESCRIPTION
    "A table of Alarm Report Control (ARC) settings on the system.

     Alarm Report Control is a feature that provides an automatic 
     in-service provisioning capability.  Alarm reporting is turned 
     off on a per-resource basis for a selective set of potential  
     alarm conditions to allow sufficient time for customer testing 
     and other maintenance activities in an "alarm free" state.
     Once a resource is ready for service, alarm reporting is 
     automatically or manually turned on. 

     There are five ARC states: 
        ALM, NALM, NALM-QI, NALM-QI-CD and NALM-TI.

        ALM:        Alarm reporting is turned on (i.e., is allowed).
        NALM:       Alarm reporting is turned off (i.e., not allowed).
        NALM-QI:    NALM - Qualified Inhibit. Alarm reporting is 
                    turned off until the managed entity is qualified 
                    problem-free for a specified persistence interval.
        NALM-QI-CD: NALM-QI - Count down. This is a substate of NALM-QI 
                    and performs the persistence timing countdown 
                    function when the managed entity is qualified 
                    problem-free.
        NALM-TI:    NALM - Timed Inhibit. Alarm reporting is turned 
                    off for a specified time interval. 
 
     ALM may transition to NALM, NALM-QI, or NAML-TI by management request.
	
     NALM may transition to ALM, NALM-QI, or NAML-TI by management request.

     NALM-QI may transition to NALM or ALM by management request.

     NALM-QI may transition to ALM automatically 
             if qualified problem-free (if NALM-QI-CD is not supported) or 
             if the CD timer expired (if NALM-QI-CD is supported)
		
     NALM-TI may transition to ALM or NALM by management request.

     NALM-TI may transition to ALM automatically if the TI timer expired.

     Further details of ARC state transitions are defined in Figure 3

    "The object controls the alarm report of a resource.  A manager can 
     set the arcState to either alm, nalm, nalmQI, or nalmTI.
        
	ALM:      Alarm reporting is turned on (i.e., is allowed).
	NALM:     Alarm reporting is turned off.
	NALM-TI:  Alarm reporting is turned off for a time interval.
		  (TI - Time Inhibit).
	NALM-QI:  Alarm reporting is turned off for a specified
                  alarm type until the resource is qualified 
                  problem-free for an optional time interval.
		  Problem-free means that the condition corresponding
		  to the specified alarm type does not exist.
		  (QI - Qualified Inhibit).
	NALM-QI-CD:   This is a substate of NALM-QI and performs the 
		      persistence timing count down function after the 
		      resource is qualified problem-free. 
		      (CD - Count Down).
	
     According to the requirements in M.3100 Amendment 3, a resource 
     supporting the ARC feature shall support the ALM state and at 
     least one of the NALM, NALM-TI, and NALM-QI states. NALM-QI-CD 
     is an optional substate of NALM-QI.

     Once the resource enters the normal reporting mode (i.e., in the alm 
     state) for the specified alarm type, the corresponding
     entry will be automatically deleted from the arc table.
     The manual setting of the arcState to alm has the effect of removing
     the entry from the arc table.

     The value of nalamQICD is a transitional state from nalmQI to alm. 
     It is optional depending on the type and the implementation of the 
     resource.  If it is supported, before the state transitions 
     from nalmQI to alm, a count down period is activated for a duration 
     set by the object arcNalmCDTimeInterval.  When the time is up, 
     the arcState is set to alm."

  DESCRIPTION
    "This variable indicates the time remaining in the NALM-TI interval 
     or the NALM-QI-CD interval, in units of second.

     At the moment the resource enters the NALM-TI state, this variable 
     will have the initial value equal to the value of
     arcNalmTITimeInterval and then starts decrementing as time goes by. 

     Similarly at the moment the resource enters the NALM-QI-CD state, 
     this variable will have the initial value equal to the value of 
     arcNalmCDTimeInterval and then starts decrementing as time goes by.

     This variable is read-write and thus will allow the manager to 
     extend or shorten, as needed, the remaining time when the resource  
     is in the NALM-TI or NALM-QI-CD state.
     
     If this variable is supported and the resource is currently not in

6.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments. The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   In particular, the ARC setting feature defined in the MIB affects 
   alarm notification generation. Unauthorized access to the write-able 
   objects could cause omission of alarm notifications or flooding 
   of unwanted alarm notifications from the netowrk. These write-able
   objects (defined with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-create) are:
   arcMIBTITimeInterval, arcMIBCDTimeInterval, arcState,
   arcNalmTimeRemaining, and arcRowStatus.

   So, it is important to control the GET/SET access to these objects 
   and possibly even encrypt the object values when sending them over the 
   network via SNMP. Not all versions of SNMP provide features for such 
   a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-based
   Access Control Model (VACM) RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.

   Note that the arc Table is indexed by resource ID. In order to
   prevent leaking of resource instance IDs, VACM should be used and
   correctly configured.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
