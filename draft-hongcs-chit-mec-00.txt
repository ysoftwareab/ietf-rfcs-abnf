User Centric Assignment and Partial Task Offloading for Mobile Edge
Computing in Ultra-Dense Networks
                        draft-hongcs-chit-mec-00

Abstract

By collocating servers at base stations, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) 
provides low latency to users for real time applications such as 
Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality. To satisfy the growing demand 
of users, base stations are deployed densely in highly populated 
areas. Coordinated Multipoint Transmission (CoMP) allows users to 
connect to multiple base stations simultaneously. In ultra-dense 
networks, by offloading the partials of tasks to different base 
stations, users can achieve lower latency and utilize the computation 
ability of the surrounding base stations. To control the signaling 
overhead, the number of base stations that can be connected should be 
limited. In this paper, we propose a user-centric base station 
assignment algorithm by considering the possible load of base 
stations. Moreover, a partial task offloading algorithm is proposed 
to utilize the computation of under-loaded base stations. Resource 
allocation is then solved by convex optimization.

1.  Introduction

Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has been an interesting topic in both 
academia and industry for its ability to provide low latency and high 
computation to users by setting up severs near to users. Computation 
and latency intensive applications requires users to offload their tasks 
to servers to achieve the minimum delay and maintain the energy of 
users’ devices. In densely deployed networks, users can utilize the 
resources of nearby base stations (BS) by offloading partials of their 
tasks with the technology provided by Coordinated Multipoint 
Transmission (CoMP).
Despite the advantages that MEC brings, there are many challenges to 
tackle in MEC which are pointed out in [1]. The communication aspect is 
surveyed in [2] where authors considered joint management of radio and 
computation resources. Authors also introduced standards and application 
scenarios.

Internet-Draft          Task Offloading for MEC             October 2020

Authors in [3] developed a distributed approach for the offloading of 
computation tasks, caching of content and allocation of resources by 
using an alternating direction method of multipliers. Task offloading 
for ultra-dense network was considered in [4] where authors divided the 
task placement and resource allocation problems and proposed an 
efficient offloading approach. But, authors considered to offload to one 
BS. In this paper, we consider partial offloading in ultra-dense 
networks. To avoid the overloading at BSs, we take the number of 
possible users who can connect to BSs into account and propose a 
heuristic algorithm for user-centric assignment. In addition, a partial 
offloading algorithm is proposed to utilize the resources of under-
loaded BSs by offloading the larger portion of tasks to those BSs. Then, 
resource allocation is solved with the help of convex optimization.


1.1.  Terminology and Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.   System Model

A network with densely deployed BSs is considered where users can 
offload their tasks to multiple BSs simultaneously.
We consider the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access in both 
uplink and downlink transmission. We also consider that MEC server are 
equipped with multi-core technology that they can compute offloaded 
tasks simultaneously. The user’s task has three parameters such as the 
size of input file, output result and task in CPU cycles.

3. Problem Formulation

The objective of the partial offloading and resource allocation problem
is to minimize the latency of all mobile users where the task must be 
computed fully. The maximum number of SBSs that a user can associate to 
is limited. The uplink bandwidth for task offloading and downlink
bandwidth for result transmission are limited. In addition, the 
computing resource at MEC servers and local computing resource are also
restricted.

4. User-centric Assignment and Partial Offloading

4.1. User-centric Assignment to SBSs
First, we need to determine the user assignment to the BSs by 
considering the overloading possibility. The score from a user to a SBS 
is calculated in which the uplink, downlink singal-to-noise ratios and 
the inverse proportion of the number of users who are likely to 
associate to a SBS is considered. 

    +---------------+      +--------+      +--------+      +--------+
    | Mobile Device |      | SBS 1  |      | SBS 2  |      | SBS 3  |
    +---------------+      +--------+      +--------+      +--------+
         |                     
   +-----------------+ 
   | Calculate score | 
   |  for all SBSs   |

4.2 Partial Task Offloading

After the assignment is done, the fractions of the task allocated to 
BSs are resolved by utilizing the resources of under-loaded BSs. The
higher portion of a task is offloaded to a SBS with a lower total 
computing load of all the assigned users. SBSs are sorted according
to the increasing computing loads of the users. The portion of the 
task is offloaded to SBSs in the order.

      +------------------+---------------+------------+------------+
User's|     Portion      |    Portion    |  Portion   |  Portion   |
task  |   offloaded to   | offloaded to  |offloaded to| computed at|
      |      SBS 1       |      SBS 2    |   SBS 3    |  the user  |
      +------------------+---------------+------------+------------+

           \        /         \     /         \  /         \  /
            \      /           \   /           \/           \/
         +------------+    +-----------+  +-----------+ +-----------+
         |   SBS 1    |    |   SBS 2   |  |   SBS 3   | |   Local   |
         +------------+    +-----------+  +-----------+ +-----------+

4.3. Radio Resource Allocation

After obtaining the partial task offloading, we need to solve the 
resource allocation problem. The resource allocation problem is convex 
which can easily be solved. In this paper, we use cvxpy [5] to solve 
this problem. For the local CPU cycles assignment, the maximum 
available CPU cycle is assigned since the objective is minimizing the 
latency.

5. Results

Poisson Point Process is used to model the deployment of BSs and users 
where their densities are 0.6/m2 6/m2 respectively. For power density 
thermal noise, -174dBm/Hz is used. Fig. 2 shows the simulation setup 
used in the paper. Transmit power of pico BSs and users are 23dbm and 
20dbm respectively. CPU speed is 4GHz at MEC server and 0.3GHz at user. 
The total uplink and downlink bandwidth are 20MHz each. The size of 
input file follows a uniform distribution between 300 and 800 KB. The 
uniform distribution is also used to model the size of tasks and output 
files which are 0.5 to 1 GHz and 0.2 to 2.5 MB respectively.
The latency obtained at SBSs are different but most of the SBSs have the 
similar latency results due to the different user task requirements. 
In the highly dense networks, the proposed approach can keep most of the 
BSs to achieve comparable results. The proposed approach obtains lower 
latency compared to the baseline approach where the loads of SBSs are 
not considered and task allocation is done uniformly. The difference 
becomes significant as the number of users increases.
