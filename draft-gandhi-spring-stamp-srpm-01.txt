    Performance Measurement Using STAMP for Segment Routing Networks
                   draft-gandhi-spring-stamp-srpm-01

Abstract

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  SR is
   applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6
   (SRv6) data planes.  This document specifies procedure for sending
   and processing probe query and response messages for Performance
   Measurement (PM) in Segment Routing networks.  The procedure uses the
   mechanisms defined in RFC 8762 (Simple Two-Way Active Measurement
   Protocol (STAMP)) for Delay Measurement, and uses the mechanisms
   defined in this document for Loss Measurement.  The procedure
   specified is applicable to SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes and is used
   for both Links and end-to-end SR Paths including SR Policies.

1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm and
   greatly simplifies network operations for Software Defined Networks
   (SDNs).  SR is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-
   MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes.  SR takes advantage of the Equal-
   Cost Multipaths (ECMPs) between source and transit nodes, between
   transit nodes and between transit and destination nodes.  SR Policies
   as defined in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] are used to
   steer traffic through a specific, user-defined paths using a stack of
   Segments.  Built-in SR Performance Measurement (PM) is one of the
   essential requirements to provide Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

   The Simple Two-way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) provides
   capabilities for the measurement of various performance metrics in IP
   networks using probe messages [RFC8762].  It eliminates the need for
   control-channel signaling by using configuration data model to
   provision a test-channel (e.g.  UDP paths).
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-stamp-option-tlv] defines TLV extensions for STAMP
   messages.

   The STAMP message with a TLV for "direct measurement" can be used for
   combined Delay + Loss measurement [I-D.ietf-ippm-stamp-option-tlv].
   However, in order to use only for loss measurement purpose, it
   requires the node to support the delay measurement messages and
   support timestamp for these messages (which may also require clock
   synchronization).  Furthermore, for hardware-based counter collection
   for direct-mode loss measurement, the optional TLV based processing
   adds unnecessary overhead (as counters are not at well-known
   locations).

   This document specifies procedures for sending and processing probe
   query and response messages for Performance Measurement in SR
   networks.  The procedure uses the mechanisms defined in [RFC8762]
   (STAMP) (including the TLV extensions) for Delay Measurement (DM),
   and uses the mechanisms defined in this document for Loss
   Measurement.  The procedure specified is applicable to SR-MPLS and
   SRv6 data planes and is used for both Links and end-to-end SR Paths
   including SR Policies.  This document also defines mechanisms for
   handling ECMPs of SR Paths for performance delay measurement.  Unless
   otherwise specified, the mechanisms defined in [RFC8762] and
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-stamp-option-tlv] are not modified by this document.

2.3.  Reference Topology

   In the reference topology shown below, the sender node R1 initiates a
   probe query for performance measurement and the reflector node R5
   sends a probe response for the query message received.  The probe
   response is sent to the sender node R1.  The nodes R1 and R5 may be
   directly connected via a Link or there exists a Point-to-Point (P2P)
   SR Path e.g.  SR Policy [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] on
   node R1 with destination to node R5.  In case of Point-to-Multipoint
   (P2MP), SR Policy originating from source node R1 may terminate on
   multiple destination leaf nodes
   [I-D.voyer-spring-sr-replication-segment].

3.  Overview

   For one-way and two-way delay measurements in Segment Routing
   networks, the probe messages defined in [RFC8762] are used.  For
   direct-mode and inferred-mode loss measurements in Segment Routing
   networks, the messages defined in this document are used.  Separate
   UDP destination port numbers are user-configured for delay and loss
   measurements from the range specified in [RFC8762].  As specified in
   [RFC8762], the reflector supports the destination UDP port 862 for
   delay measurement probe messages by default.  This UDP port however,
   is not used for loss measurement probe messages defined in this
   document.  The sender uses the UDP port number following the
   guidelines specified in Section 6 in [RFC6335].  For both Links and
   end-to-end SR Paths including SR Policies, no PM session for delay or
   loss measurement is created on the reflector node R5 [RFC8762].

   For Performance Measurement, probe query and response messages are
   sent as following:

   o  For Delay Measurement, the probe messages are sent on the
      congruent path of the data traffic by the sender node, and are
      used to measure the delay experienced by the actual data traffic
      flowing on the Links and SR Paths.

   o  For Loss Measurement, the probe messages are sent on the congruent
      path of the data traffic by the sender node, and are used to
      collect the receive traffic counters for the incoming link or
      incoming SID where the probe query messages are received at the
      reflector node (incoming link or incoming SID needed since the
      reflector node does not have PM session state present).

   The In-Situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM)
   mechanisms for SR-MPLS defined in [I-D.gandhi-mpls-ioam-sr] and for
   SRv6 defined in [I-D.ali-spring-ioam-srv6] are used to carry PM
   information such as timestamp in-band as part of the data packets,
   and are outside the scope of this document.

3.1.  Example Provisioning Model

   An example of a provisioning model and typical measurement parameters
   for each user-configured destination UDP port for performance delay
   and loss measurements is shown in the following Figure 1:

   The reflector node R5 uses the parameters for the timestamp format
   and delay measurement mode (i.e. one-way or two-way mode) from the
   received probe query message.

4.  Probe Messages

4.1.  Probe Query Message

   The probe messages defined in [RFC8762] are used for Delay
   Measurement for Links and end-to-end SR Paths including SR Policies.
   For Loss Measurement, the probe messages defined in this document are
   used.

   The Sender IPv4 or IPv6 address is used as the source address.  The
   reflector IPv4 or IPv6 address is used as the destination address.
   In the case of SR Policy with IPv4 endpoint of 0.0.0.0 or IPv6
   endpoint of ::0 [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy], the address
   in the range of 127/8 for IPv4 or ::FFFF:127/104 for IPv6 is used as
   the destination address, respectively.

4.1.1.  Delay Measurement Query Message

   The message content for Delay Measurement probe query message using
   UDP header [RFC0768] is shown in Figure 2.  The DM probe query
   message is sent with user-configured Destination UDP port number for
   DM.  The Destination UDP port cannot be used as Source port, since
   the message does not have any indication to distinguish between the
   query and response message.  The payload of the DM probe query
   message contains the delay measurement message defined in [RFC8762].

   Timestamp field is eight bytes and use the format defined in
   Section 4.2.1 of [RFC8762].  It is recommended to use the IEEE 1588v2
   Precision Time Protocol (PTP) truncated 64-bit timestamp format
   [IEEE1588] as specified in [RFC8186], with hardware support in
   Segment Routing networks.

4.1.1.1.  Delay Measurement Authentication Mode

   When using the authenticated mode for delay measurement, the matching
   authentication type (e.g.  HMAC-SHA-256) and key are user-configured
   on both the sender and reflector nodes.  A separate user-configured
   destination UDP port is used for the delay measurement in
   authentication mode due to the different probe message format.

4.1.2.  Loss Measurement Query Message

   The message content for Loss Measurement probe query message using
   UDP header [RFC0768] is shown in Figure 3.  The LM probe query
   message is sent with user-configured Destination UDP port number for
   LM, which is a different Destination UDP port number than DM.
   Separate Destination UDP ports are used for direct-mode and inferred-
   mode loss measurements.  The Destination UDP port cannot be used as
   Source port, since the message does not have any indication to
   distinguish between the query and response message.  The LM probe
   query message contains the payload for loss measurement as defined in
   Figure 7 and Figure 8.

4.1.2.1.  Loss Measurement Authentication Mode

   When using the authenticated mode for loss measurement, the matching
   authentication type (e.g.  HMAC-SHA-256) and key are user-configured
   on both the sender and reflector nodes.  A separate user-configured
   destination UDP port is used for the loss measurement in
   authentication mode due to the different message format.

4.1.3.  Probe Query for Links

   The probe query message as defined in Figure 2 for delay measurement

       been sent over a bidirectional path and the probe response is
       required over the same path in the reverse direction.

       0x2: No Response Requested.

4.1.6.  Loss Measurement Query Message Formats

   In this document, STAMP probe query messages for loss measurement are
   defined as shown in Figure 7 and Figure 8.  The message formats are
   hardware efficient due to well-known locations of the counters and
   payload small in size.  They are stand-alone and similar to the delay
   measurement message formats (e.g. location of the Counter and
   Timestamp).  They also do not require backwards compatibility and
   support for the existing DM message formats from [RFC8762] as
   different user-configured destination UDP port is used for loss
   measurement.

   Sequence Number (32-bit): As defined in [RFC8762].

   Transmit Counter (64-bit): The number of packets or octets sent by
   the sender node in the query message and by the reflector node in the
   response message.  The counter is always written at the well-known
   location in the probe query and response messages.

   Receive Counter (64-bit): The number of packets or octets received at
   the reflector node.  It is written by the reflector node in the probe
   response message.

   Sender Counter (64-bit): This is the exact copy of the transmit
   counter from the received query message.  It is written by the
   reflector node in the probe response message.

   Sender Sequence Number (32-bit): As defined in [RFC8762].

   Sender TTL: As defined in Section 7.1.

   LM Flags: The meanings of the Flag bits are:

      X: Extended counter format indicator.  Indicates the use of
      extended (64-bit) counter values.  Initialized to 1 upon creation
      (and prior to transmission) of an LM Query and copied from an LM
      Query to an LM response.  Set to 0 when the LM message is
      transmitted or received over an interface that writes 32-bit
      counter values.

      B: Octet (byte) count.  When set to 1, indicates that the Counter
      1-4 fields represent octet counts.  The octet count applies to all
      packets within the LM scope, and the octet count of a packet sent
      or received includes the total length of that packet (but excludes
      headers, labels, or framing of the channel itself).  When set to
      0, indicates that the Counter fields represent packet counts.

   Block Number (8-bit): The Loss Measurement using Alternate-Marking
   method defined in [RFC8321] requires to color the data traffic.  To
   be able to compare the transmit and receive traffic counters of the
   matching color, the Block Number (or color) of the traffic counters
   is carried by the probe query and response messages for loss
   measurement.

   HMAC: The PM probe message in authenticated mode includes a key
   Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC) [RFC2104] hash.  Each probe
   query and response messages are authenticated by adding Sequence
   Number with Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC) TLV.  It can
   use HMAC-SHA-256 truncated to 128 bits (similarly to the use of it in

   IPSec defined in [RFC4868]); hence the length of the HMAC field is 16
   octets.

   HMAC uses its own key and the mechanism to distribute the HMAC key is
   outside the scope of this document.

   In authenticated mode, only the sequence number is encrypted, and the
   other payload fields are sent in clear text.  The probe message MAY
   include Comp.MBZ (Must Be Zero) variable length field to align the
   packet on 16 octets boundary.

4.2.  Probe Response Message

   The probe response message is sent using the IP/UDP information from
   the received probe query message.  The content of the probe response
   message is shown in Figure 9.

4.2.1.  One-way Measurement Mode

   In one-way performance measurement mode, the probe response message
   as defined in Figure 9 is sent back out-of-band to the sender node,
   for both Links and SR Policies.  The Sender Control Code is set to
   "Out-of-band Response Requested".  In this delay measurement mode, as
   per Reference Topology, all timestamps t1, t2, t3, and t4 are
   collected by the probes.  However, only timestamps t1 and t2 are used
   to measure one-way delay.

4.2.2.  Two-way Measurement Mode

   In two-way performance measurement mode, when using a bidirectional
   path, the probe response message as defined in Figure 9 is sent back
   to the sender node on the congruent path of the data traffic on the
   same reverse direction Link or associated reverse SR Policy
   [I-D.ietf-pce-sr-bidir-path].  The Sender Control Code is set to "In-
   band Response Requested".  In this delay measurement mode, as per
   Reference Topology, all timestamps t1, t2, t3, and t4 are collected
   by the probes.  All four timestamps are used to measure two-way
   delay.

   Specifically, the probe response message is sent back on the incoming
   physical interface where the probe query message is received.  This
   is required for example, in case of two-way measurement mode for Link
   delay.

4.3.  Node Address TLV

   In this document, Node Address TLV is defined for STAMP message
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-stamp-option-tlv] and has the following format shown
   in Figure 14:

    0                   1                   2                   3

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                    Figure 14: Node Address TLV Format

   The Address Family field indicates the type of the address, and it
   SHALL be set to one of the assigned values in the "IANA Address
   Family Numbers" registry.

   The following Type is defined and it contains Node Address TLV:

   Destination Node Address (value TBA1):

   The Destination Node Address TLV is optional.  The Destination Node
   Address TLV indicates the address of the intended recipient node of
   the probe message.  The reflector node MUST NOT send response if it
   is not the intended destination node of the probe query message.
   This check is useful for example, for performance measurement of SR
   Policy when using the destination address in 127/8 range for IPv4 or
   in ::FFFF:127/104 range for IPv6.

4.4.  Return Path TLV

   For two-way performance measurement, the reflector node needs to send
   the probe response message on a specific reverse path.  The sender
   node can request in the probe query message to the reflector node to
   send a response back on a given reverse path (e.g. co-routed
   bidirectional path).  This way the destination node does not require
   any additional SR Policy state.

   For one-way performance measurement, the sender node address may not
   be reachable via IP route from the reflector node.  The sender node
   in this case needs to send its reachability path information to the
   reflector node.

   [I-D.ietf-ippm-stamp-option-tlv] defines STAMP probe query messages
   that can include one or more optional TLVs.  The TLV Type (value
   TBA2) is defined in this document for Return Path that carries
   reverse path for STAMP probe response messages (in the payload of the
   message).  The format of the Return Path TLV is shown in Figure 15:

Internet-Draft          STAMP for Segment Routing              June 2020


   o  Type (value 2): SR-MPLS Binding SID
      [I-D.ietf-pce-binding-label-sid] of the Reverse SR Policy

   o  Type (value 3): SRv6 Segment List of the Reverse SR Path

   o  Type (value 4): SRv6 Binding SID [I-D.ietf-pce-binding-label-sid]
      of the Reverse SR Policy

   The Return Path TLV is optional.  The PM sender node MUST only insert
   one Return Path TLV in the probe query message and the reflector node
   MUST only process the first Return Path TLV in the probe query
   message and ignore other Return Path TLVs if present.  The reflector
   node MUST send probe response message back on the reverse path
   specified in the Return Path TLV and MUST NOT add Return Path TLV in
   the probe response message.

4.5.  Additional Probe Message Processing Rules

   The processing rules defined in this section are applicable to the
   STAMP messages for delay and loss measurement for Links and end-to-
   end SR Paths including SR Policies.

   messages is set to 255 [RFC8762].  Similarly, the Hop Limit field in
   the IPv6 and SRH headers of the probe query messages is set to 255
   [RFC8762].

   When using the Destination IPv4 Address from the 127/8 range, the TTL
   in the IPv4 header is set to 1 [RFC8029].  Similarly, when using the
   Destination IPv6 Address from the ::FFFF:127/104 range, the Hop Limit
   field in the IPv6 header is set to 1.

   For Link performance delay and loss measurements, the TTL or Hop
   Limit field in the probe message is set to 1 in both one-way and two-
   way measurement modes.

4.5.2.  Router Alert Option

   The Router Alert IP option (RAO) [RFC2113] is not set in the probe
   messages.

4.5.3.  UDP Checksum

   The UDP Checksum Complement for delay and loss measurement messages
   follows the procedure defined in [RFC7820] and can be optionally used
   with the procedures defined in this document.

   For IPv4 and IPv6 probe messages, where the hardware is not capable
   of re-computing the UDP checksum or adding checksum complement
   [RFC7820], the sender node sets the UDP checksum to 0 [RFC6936]
   [RFC8085].  The receiving node bypasses the checksum validation and
   accepts the packets with UDP checksum value 0 for the UDP port being
   used for PM delay and loss measurements.

5.  Performance Measurement for P2MP SR Policies

   The procedures for delay and loss measurement described in this
   document for Point-to-Point (P2P) SR Policies
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] are also equally applicable
   to the Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) SR Policies as following:

   o  The sender root node sends probe query messages using the
      Replication Segment defined in
      [I-D.voyer-spring-sr-replication-segment] for the P2MP SR Policy
      as shown in Figure 17.

   o  Each reflector leaf node sends its IP address in the Source
      Address of the probe response messages as shown in Figure 9.  This
      allows the sender root node to identify the reflector leaf nodes
      of the P2MP SR Policy.

   o  The P2MP root node measures the end-to-end delay and loss
      performance for each P2MP leaf node of the P2MP SR Policy.

6.  ECMP Support for SR Policies

   An SR Policy can have ECMPs between the source and transit nodes,
   between transit nodes and between transit and destination nodes.
   Usage of Anycast SID [RFC8402] by an SR Policy can result in ECMP
   paths via transit nodes part of that Anycast group.  The PM probe
   messages need to be sent to traverse different ECMP paths to measure
   performance delay of an SR Policy.

Internet-Draft          STAMP for Segment Routing              June 2020


   Forwarding plane has various hashing functions available to forward
   packets on specific ECMP paths.  The mechanisms described in
   [RFC8029] and [RFC5884] for handling ECMPs are also applicable to the
   performance measurement.  In IPv4 header of the PM probe messages,
   sweeping of Destination Address in 127/8 range can be used to
   exercise particular ECMP paths.  As specified in [RFC6437], Flow
   Label field in the outer IPv6 header can also be used for sweeping.

   The considerations for performance loss measurement for different
   ECMP paths of an SR Policy are outside the scope of this document.

7.  Performance Delay and Liveness Monitoring

   The procedure defined in this document for delay measurement using
   the STAMP probe messages can also be applied to liveness monitoring
   of Links and SR Paths.  The one-way or two-way measurement mode can
   be used for liveness monitoring.  Liveness failure is notified when
   consecutive N number of probe response messages are not received back
   at the sender node, where N is locally provisioned value.  Note that
   detection interval and scale for number of sessions need to account
   for the processing of the probe messages which are punted out of fast
   path in forwarding (to slow path or control plane), and re-injected
   back on the reflector node.

8.  Security Considerations

   The performance measurement is intended for deployment in well-
   managed private and service provider networks.  As such, it assumes
   that a node involved in a measurement operation has previously
   verified the integrity of the path and the identity of the far-end
   reflector node.

   If desired, attacks can be mitigated by performing basic validation
   and sanity checks, at the sender, of the counter or timestamp fields
   in received measurement response messages.  The minimal state
   associated with these protocols also limits the extent of measurement
   disruption that can be caused by a corrupt or invalid message to a
   single query/response cycle.

   Use of HMAC-SHA-256 in the authenticated mode protects the data
   integrity of the probe messages.  SRv6 has HMAC protection
   authentication defined for SRH [RFC8754].  Hence, PM probe messages
   for SRv6 may not need authentication mode.  Cryptographic measures
   may be enhanced by the correct configuration of access-control lists
   and firewalls.

9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA will create a "STAMP TLV Type" registry for
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-stamp-option-tlv].  IANA is requested to allocate a
   value for the following mandatory Destination Address TLV Type from
   this registry.  This TLV is to be carried in PM probe messages.

   o  Type TBA1: Destination Node Address TLV

   IANA is also requested to allocate a value for the following
   mandatory Return Path TLV Type from the same registry.  This TLV is
   to be carried in PM probe query messages.

   o  Type TBA2: Return Path TLV

   IANA is requested to create a sub-registry for "Return Path Sub-TLV
   Type".  All code points in the range 1 through 32759 in this registry
   shall be allocated according to the "IETF Review" procedure as
   specified in [RFC8126].  Code points in the range 32760 through 65279
   in this registry shall be allocated according to the "First Come
   First Served" procedure as specified in [RFC8126].  Remaining code
   points are allocated according to Table 1:

   +---------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
   | Value         |       Description       | Reference               |

                Table 1: Return Path Sub-TLV Type Registry

   IANA is requested to allocate the values for the following Sub-TLV
   Types from this registry.

   o  Type (value 0): Return Address

   o  Type (value 1): SR-MPLS Label Stack of the Reverse SR Path
