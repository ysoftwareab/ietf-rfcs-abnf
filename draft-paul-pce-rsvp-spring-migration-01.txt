PCEP extension to support service migration from rsvp to spring or vice
versa
                draft-paul-pce-rsvp-spring-migration-01

Abstract


   In a SDN environment, path computation element protocol(PCEP)
   (RFC 5440) is used between a controller and the network devices, 
   using which controller can setup and tear down Resource ReserVation 
   Protocol (RSVP) based label switched paths(LSPs) in the network 
   having Path Computation Client (PCC) as Label Switched Router (LSR). 
   Draft draft-sivabalan-pce-segment-routing extends PCEP specification 
   in order to support setup and teardown of Segment Routing(SR) Label 
   Switched Path(LSR). In a mixed environment where some of the LSPs are 
   setup using PCEP use RSVP and some LSPs are based on Segment 
   routing(SR). The specifications lacks a method to advertise the 
   LSP preferenace to use one type of LSP over other when those are 
   setup using PCEP. This draft defines a method to advertise the 
   preference for any LSP which is setup using PCEP.

   This document proposes new optional TLV that can be used to announce 
   the preference of LSP which is being setup using PCEP.

1.  Introduction

   As described in [RFC5440], PCEP can be used to create, modify or 
   delete LSPs betweeen PCCs. PCEP can be used to create, modify and 
   delete RSVP and segment routing LSPs between PCCs. This document 
   specifies the way to communicate the LSP preference to PCC so that 
   correct LSP can be used by the MPLS services based on operator need.
   This is specially needed in case of migration of services from RSVP 
   to SR LSP in a phased manner.

Internet-Draft       LSP preference for PCEP        August 2017


   [RFC5440], [draft-crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] and 
   [draft-sivabalan-pce-segment-routing] define a method to create,
   delete and modify RSVP and segment routing LSPs using PCEP as 
   communication protocol with PCC. However  [RFC5440], 
   [draft-crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] and 
   [draft-sivabalan-pce-segment-routing] lacks a method to specify the 
   preference for the LSPs which is useful in case operator wants to 
   seamlessless migrate from RSVP to segment routed LSPs or vice versa.
   
   This document proposes new TLV inside LSP object to carry the 
   preference value for the particular LSP. LSP objects are carried in 
   PCRpt, PCUpd [draft-tang-pce-stateful-pce] section 6 and PCInitiate 
   [draft-crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] section 5. 

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

3.  TLV extension to support LSP preference

   The LSP object is defined in section 7.3 of 
   [draft-ietf-pce-stateful-pce]. In this section, we extend the LSP 
   object to include optional TLV to carry the LSP preference. 

    The format of the LSP object body is shown in Figure 1:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

     |                                                               |

 3.1.  LSP preference TLV


   The LSP preference value TLV is an optional TLV for use in the 
   LSP object to convey LSP preference value.  When an LSP is 
   created/modified in PCC using PCEP, this TLV may be carried in the 
   LSP object. When it is carried in the LSP object the preference value 
   for this particular LSP is set to the preference carried in the TLV. 
   It overwrites any local preference value set for RSVP or segment 
   routing LSP in the PCC.

  The format of the LSP-PREFERENCE-VALUE TLV is shown in the following
   figure:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |           Type=[TBD]          |            Length=4           |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                          LSP preference value                 |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                   Figure 2: LSP-PREFERENCE-VALUE TLV format


   The type of the TLV is to be assigned by IANA and it has a fixed
   length of 4 octets.  The LSP prefernce value contains a number that 
   indicates preference for that LSP.



4.  Backward Compatibility Consideration

   A PCC that does not support the new LSP prefernce TLV 
   specified in this document silently ignores those bits.

   PCEP extensions defined in this document do not introduce any new
   interoperability issues.

5.  Management Considerations

   A configuration option may be provided for accepting these preference
   changes.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document raises no new security issues.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a Type for this new TLV for LSP 
   preference support capability.
