1.  Introduction

   Anycast is a new type of address along with unicast and multicast in
   IPv6.  Different nodes could be assigned with one same anycast
   address.  When a packet's destination is the anycast address, a could
   be delivered to the "nearest" interface among all the interfaces
   assigned to the anycast address.  This kind of delivery is achieved
   by notion of "distance" determined by the routing protocols in use.

   An anycast address may be used to allow nodes to access one of a
   collection of servers providing a well-known service, without manual
   configuration in each node of the list of servers.  The most typical
   application is in Domain Name System [RFC1035] that Most of the root
   DNS server have used anycast addresses.  As well as the root servers,
   [RFC4339] section 3.3 discusses the approach of using a well-known
   anycast address in DNS recursive resolvers.

   However, since site-local IPv6 addresses are deprecated by [RFC3879],
   the site-local well-know anycast use case becomes unvalid as well.
   This document proposes to use ULAs as alternatives for site-local
   anycast use cases.

2.  ULA Alternatives

   There are mainly two reasons to use ULAs as the alternatives:

   o  ULAs are normally used within a site scope.  The famous ULA prefix
      could ensure the ULAs could be easily filtered by the site
      boudary.  This feature fits the site-scoped DNS recursive
      resolvers very well.

   o  ULAs are provider independent so that stable site-local
      communications could be enabled regardless of renumbering caused
      by the ISPs.
