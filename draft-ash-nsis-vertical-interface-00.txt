Abstract

   This draft describes a mechanism to map QoS requirements from the
   User application layer down to the user plane to create an NSIS
   session.  This 'vertical signaling interface' between the user
   application layer and user plane is needed to communicate these QoS
   requirements, such as flow priority values, to user plane network
   elements.

Internet Draft  User Appl-to-User Plane Vertical Interface   July 2005


1. Introduction

   This draft describes a mechanism to map QoS requirements from the
   user application layer down to the user plane to create an NSIS
   session.  This 'vertical signaling interface' between the user
   application layer and user plane is needed to communicate these QoS
   requirements, such as flow priority values, to user plane network
   elements.  For this discussion, SIP is the signaling protocol assumed
   at the user application layer and QoS-NSIS signaling layer protocol
   (QoS-NSLP) is assumed at the user plane layer.

   [QoS-SIG] and [QSPEC] define message types and control information
   for the QoS-NSLP generic to all QoS models (QOSMs), for example,
   [Y.1541-QOSM], [INTSERV-QOSM], [RMD-QOSM], and [3GPP-QOSM].  A QOSM
   is a defined mechanism for achieving QoS as a whole.  The
   specification of a QOSM includes a description of its QSPEC parameter
   information, as well as how that information should be treated or
   interpreted in the network.  The QSPEC [QSPEC] contains a set of
   parameters and values describing the requested resources.  It is
   opaque to the QoS-NSLP and similar in purpose to the TSpec, RSpec
   and AdSpec specified in [RFC2205, RFC2210].  The QSPEC object
   contains control information and the QoS parameters defined by the
   QOSM.  At each QoS NSIS element (QNE), its contents are interpreted
   by the resource management function (RMF) for the purposes of policy
   control and traffic control (including admission control and
   configuration of the packet classifier and scheduler).

   In this scenario, various parameters in the QSPEC are derived from
   the user application layer signaling, such as QoS class [Y.1541,
   Y.1541-QOSM], priority class, and other parameters.  Work on
   identifying the requirements to communicate the performance, QoS,
   priority, and other attributes related to the user application to
   the user-plane NSIS signaling process to set up the required flow
   with the desired properties has commenced in other standards bodies
   [VERT-INTERFACE].

   This document proposes that an adaptation of the NSIS QoS NSLP could
   be an appropriate way to develop a vertical interface protocol (VIP).
   The progression of a high-priority, emergency telecommunications
   service (ETS) VoIP call is used as an illustrative example to
   demonstrate the need for developing a vertical signaling interface
   between the user application layer and user plane. 

   To date, no mechanisms or protocol exists that can communicate
   traffic attributes from the incoming application to the user plane
   setup process.  Protocol extensions to meet the requirements of the
   vertical interface are proposed.

2. Signaling Overview & Vertical Interface Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   A SIP-based ETS VoIP application is described here as an illustrative
   example.  Consider the scenario depicted in Figure 1.  SIP is able to
   identify various QoS parameters including flow priority with the
   resource priority header [RPH], bandwidth using SIP with
   preconditions [RFC3312] to negotiate voice codec bandwidth, and other
   attributes.  VoIP Gateways GW1 and GW2 are both signaling and media
   gateways.  They are connected to the user application layer via the
   call control agent (CCA) and to the user plane MPLS network via edge
   routers PE1 and PE2, respectively.  In each direction, a
   DiffServ-enabled MPLS traffic engineering (DSTE) [RFC3564] tunnel
   passes from the head-end edge router, through core network P
   routers, to the tail-end edge router. GW1 and GW2 are both SIP
   enabled and vertical interface enabled.

   A high level call setup sequence is as follows:

   o ETS user dials 1-710-NCS-GETS to establish an ETS VoIP call.  The
     call gets routed by a local exchange carrier (LEC) access network
     to the service provider's GW1.
   o GW1 recognizes the call as an ETS call based on the dialed number
     or via the SS7 initial address message indicator.  GW1 formulates a
     SIP INVITE message marked with appropriate packet markings:
     - SIP with pre-conditions used to negotiate codec bandwidth
     - RPH populated with ETS namespace and ets.0 for highest priority
   o GW1 infers additional QoS parameter information based on
     information available at the access network interface (trunk group
     characteristics, dialed number, SS7 initial address message, etc.):
     - Y.1541 QoS class [Y.1541] set to class 0 with stringent delay
       Requirements
     - DiffServ PHB set to high-priority expedited forwarding (EF1)
       [2-EF-QUEUES]
     - Reservation Priority set to high
     - Restoration Priority set to high
   o GW1 communicates the QoS parameter information via the proposed
     VIP to the NSIS QoS-NSLP user-plane function
   o NSIS QoS-NSLP user-plane function sets up the ETS call flow with
     the Y.1541-QOSM and required attributes in the QSPEC
     - <Bandwidth> = negotiated bandwidth
     - <Y.1541 QoS Class> = class 0
     - <DSTE Class Type> = class type 0
     - <Reservation Priority> = high
     - <Restoration Priority> = high

   Thus, the VIP is needed to communicate priority and QoS information
   available from the SIP INVITE and inferred from additional inputs
   available at the access network interface about the incoming traffic
   flow into the NSIS-based signaling process for the flow setup.  The
   SIP, VIP, and NSIS flow setup request messages are illustrated in
   Figure 2:

   o caller C1 initiates call by sending SIP INVITE to GW1, which passes
     the INVITE to the CCA.  The INVITE message may contain a list of
     supported codecs, RPH priority, and other QoS parameters
   o GW2 chooses a compatible codec from the list and responds with SIP
     183 Session Progress
   o GW1 receives SIP response message with codec to be used (indicates
     bandwidth required
   o GW1 sends VIP-request message to PE1, requesting bandwidth, RPH
     priority, and other QoS parameters for the call
   o GW2 also sends a VIP-request message to PE2
   o PE1 sends NSIS RESERVE/RESPONSE to establish flow from left to
     right, PE1 responds to GW1 with a VIP-response message
   o PE2 uses NSIS RESERVE/RESPONSE to establish flow from right to
     left, PE2 responds to GW2 with a VIP-response message

   o GW2 sends a SIP 200 OK message to GW1
   o GW1 sends a SIP UPDATE message to GW2
   o GW2 sends INVITE to destination phone, which responds with SIP 180
     RINGING
   o called party answers, destination phone responds with SIP 200 OK
   o RTP media streams in both directions pass through the DSTE tunnels
     as they traverse the MPLS network

   Figure 3 illustrates details of NSIS signaling and processing.  The
   QoS NSIS initiator (QNI) initiates an end-to-end, inter-domain QoS
   NSLP RESERVE message containing the Initiator QSPEC.  Based on the
   Y.1541-QOSM procedures, which the QNI supports, the QNI sets
   <QoS Desired>, <Available QoS> and <Minimum QoS> QSPEC objects in the
   Initiator QSPEC, and initializes <QoS Available> to <QoS Desired>
   with Y.1541-QOSM parameters, obtained from the VIP-request message,
   as follows:

   o <Bandwidth> = negotiated bandwidth
   o <Y.1541 QoS Class> = class 0
   o <DSTE Class Type> = class type 0
   o <Reservation Priority> = high
   o <Restoration Priority> = high

   Each QNE on the path reads and interprets those parameters in the
   Initiator QSPEC that it needs to implement the QOSM within its
   domain, and checks to see if <QoS Available> resources can be
   reserved.  If not, the QNE reduces the parameter values in <QoS
   Available> and reserves these values, where the minimum parameter
   values are given in <Minimum QoS>.  If the <Available QoS> fails to
   satisfy one or more of the objectives, the QNE notifies the QNI and
   the reservation is aborted.  Otherwise, the QNR notifies the QNI of
   the <QoS Available> for the reservation.

   In Figure 3, the RESERVE message containing the Initiator QSPEC
   arrives at the ingress node of the Local-QOSM domain.  This triggers
   the generation of a Local QSPEC, which is pushed on top of the
   Initiator QSPEC.  That is, the Initiator QSPEC is translated into a
   Local-QOSM QSPEC.  For example, if the Local-QOSM is the RMD-QOSM
   [RMD], then the <Y.1541 QOS Class> parameter would be translated to
   the <PHB Class> parameter [DSCP-MAPPING].  The Local QSPEC is used
   for QoS processing in the Local-QOSM domain, and then popped at the
   egress edge node of the Local-QOSM domain.  The Initiator QSPEC is
   then used for QoS processing at the QoS NSIS receiver (QNR).

3. Vertical Interface Protocol

   This document proposes that an adaptation of the NSIS QoS NSLP would
   be appropriate to use as a basis for the VIP.  This is because the
   RESERVE and RESPONSE messages already satisfy the requirements for
   the VIP-request and VIP-response messages.  Also, the
   QSPEC parameters are already defined to convey the necessary QoS
   parameter information supported by the NSIS protocol.

   Future versions of this document will specify more details of the
   VIP.
