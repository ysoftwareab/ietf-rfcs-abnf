1.  Introduction

   This draft defines a block type to augment those defined
   in RFC3611 for use in Quality of Service reporting for audio over IP.
   The new block type defined in this draft is the IP Audio Metrics 
   Report Block. This is intended to support both the identification of
   problems affecting performance and the collection of data that may
   be useful in optimizing system configuration.

   Audio performance may be measured using zero (no) reference, partial
   (reduced) reference or full reference.  The primary application of
   this draft is to support the reporting of real-time, in-service
   performance obtained using a zero or partial reference model however
   this approach could also be used to support the remote reporting of
   metrics from a full reference test.

3.2 Definition of Metrics

  3.2.1 Header
  The header comprises:
    (i) Block Type for this report block
    (ii) Reserved (set to 0xFF)
    (iii) Block length in words (set to 0x0008)
    (iv) SSRC of the received RTP stream that this report refers to
    (v) Program ID (PID) for the audio stream (if MPEG Transport
        encapsulation is used)
    (vi) Reserved (set to 0xFFFF)

  3.2.2 Measurement Interval
  The interval of time over which these metrics were measured,
  expressed in milliseconds.

  3.2.3 Mean Audio Bit Rate
  The average bit rate of the audio stream expressed in bits per
  second.

  3.2.4 Round Trip Delay
  The Round Trip Delay between the originating and terminating ends
  of this RTP stream, expressed in millseconds.  In unicast or
  multicast applications this parameter may be set to "undefined"
  (0xFFFF).

  3.2.5 A-V Delay
  The relative delay between decoded audio and video streams expressed
  in milliseconds.  

  3.2.6 Playout Interrupt Count
  The number of interruptions that occurred during playout, due to 
  either packet loss or buffer underrun.

  3.2.7 Mean Playout Interrupt Size
  The mean duration of interruptions in playout expressed in
  milliseconds.

  3.2.8 Audio Playout Buffer Size
  The available playout buffer size, expressed in milliseconds.

  3.2.9 Mean Buffer Level
  The mean playout buffer size, expressed in milliseconds.

4. Summary

  This draft defines an RTCP XR block for audio quality reporting.
  This is intended for in-service monitoring of audio streaming, IPTV
  and IP videoconferencing services to provide real time performance
  feedback and support performance management. 


5. IANA Considerations

  The block type "mmm" will need to be replaced with an IANA assigned
  number within those allocated for RTCP XR report blocks (RFC 3611).

6.  Security Considerations

   RTCP reports can contain sensitive information since they can provide
   information about the nature and duration of a session established
   between two endpoints.  As a result, any third party wishing to
   obtain this information should be properly authenticated and the
   information transferred securely.
