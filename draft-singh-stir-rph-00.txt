                        draft-singh-stir-rph-00

Abstract

   This document extends the PASSporT object to convey
   cryptographically-signed assertions of authorization for
   communications 'Resource-Priority'.  It extends PASSporT to allow
   cryptographic-signing of the SIP 'Resource-Priority" header field
   which is used for communications resource prioritization.  It also
   describes how the PASSPorT extension is used in SIP signaling to
   convey assertions of authorization of the information in the SIP
   'Resource-Priority' header field.

1.  Introduction

   PASSporT [I-D.ietf-stir-passport] is a token format based on JWT
   [RFC7519] for conveying cryptographically-signed information about
   the identities involved in personal communications; it is used with
   STIR [I-D.ietf-stir-rfc4474bis] to convey a signed assertion of the
   identity of the participants in real-time communications established
   via a protocol like SIP.  This specification extends PASSporT to
   allow cryptographic-signing of the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header
   field defined in [RFC4412].

   [RFC4412] defines the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field for
   communications Resource Priority.  As specified in [RFC4412], the
   'Resource-Priority' header field may be used by SIP user agents,
   including, Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) gateways and
   terminals, and SIP proxy servers to influence prioritization afforded
   to communication sessions,including PSTN calls.  However, the SIP

Internet-Draft                PASSporT-ext                     June 2017


   'Resource-Priority' header field could be spoofed and abused by
   unauthorized entities.

   The STIR architecture assumes that an authority on the originating
   side of a call provides a cryptographic assurance of the validity of
   the calling party number in order to prevent impersonation attacks.
   The STIR architecture allows extension that can be utilized by
   authorities supporting real-time communication services using the
   'Resource-Priority' header field to cryptographically sign the SIP
   'Resource-Priority' header field and convey assertion of the
   authorization for 'Resource-Priority'.  For example, the authority on
   the originating side verifying the authorization of a particular
   communication for Resource-Priority can use a PASSPorT claim to
   cryptographically-sign the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field and
   convey an assertion of the authorization for 'Resource-Priority'.
   This will allow a receiving entity (including entities located in
   different network domains/boundaries) to verify the validity of
   assertions authorizating Resource-Priority.  Cryphographically-signed
   SIP 'Resource-Priority' headers will allow a receiving entity to
   verify and act on the information with confidence that the
   information have not been spoofed or compromised.

   This specification documents an optional extension to PASSporT and
   the associated STIR mechanisms to provide a function to sign the SIP
   'Resource-Priority' header field.  How the optional extension to
   PASSporT is used for real-time communications supported using SIP
   'Resource-Priority' header field is defined in other documents and is
   outside the scope of this document.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  PASSporT 'rph' Claim

   This specification defines a new JSON Web Token claim for "rph",
   which provides an assertion for information in SIP 'Resource-
   Priority'header.

   The creator of a PASSporT object adds a "ppt" value of "rph" to the
   header of a PASSporT object, in which case the PASSporT claims MUST
   contain a "rph" claim, and any entities verifying the PASSporT object
   will be required to understand the "ppt" extension in order to
   process the PASSporT in question.  A PASSPort header with the "ppt"
   included will look as follows:




Singh, et al.           Expires December 8, 2017                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                PASSporT-ext                     June 2017


   {  "typ":"passport",
     "ppt":"rph",
     "alg":"ES256",
     "x5u":"https://www.example.org/cert.cer"}

   The "rph" claim will provide an assertion of authorization,"auth",
   for information in the SIP "Resource-Priority" header field (i.e.,
   Resource-Priority: namespace "." r-priority) based on [RFC4412].  The
   value of the "rph" claim is an array containing one or more of JSON
   objects for the content of the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header that is
   being asserted of which one of the "rph" object, is mandatory.

   The following is an example "rph" claim for a SIP "Resource-Priority"
   header field with a "namespace "." r-priority" value of "ets.0".

    { "orig":{"tn":"12155551212"}
     "dest":{"tn":"12125551213"},
     "iat":1443208345,
     "rph":{"auth":":"Resource-Priority: ets.0"}}

   After the header and claims PASSporT objects have been constructed,
   their signature is generated normally per the guidance in
   [I-D.ietf-stir-passport] using the full form of PASSPorT.  The
   credentials (e.g., authority responsible for authorizating Resource-
   Priority) used to create the signature must have authority over the
   "rph" claim.

4.  'rph' in SIP

   This section specifies SIP-specific usage for the "rph" claim in
   PASSporT.

4.1.  Authentication Service Behavior

   The Authentication Service will create the "rph" claim using the
   values discussed in section 3 based on [RFC4412].  The constrcution
   of "rph" claim follows the steps described in Section 4 of
   [I-D.ietf-stir-rfc4474bis].

   The resulting Identity header for "rph" might look as follows:

info= "https://www.example.org/cert.cer";alg=ES256;ppt="rph"

   A SIP authentication service typically will derive the value of "rph"
   from the 'Resource-Priority' header field based on policy associated
   with service specific use of the "namespace "." r-priority" values
   based on [RFC4412].  The authentication service derives the value of
   the PASSPorT claim by verifying the authorization for Resource-
   Priority (i.e., verifying a calling user privilege for Resoure-
   Priority based on its identity) which mighth be derived from customer
   profile data or from access to external services.

   [RFC4412] allows multiple "namespace "." r-priority" pairs, either in
   a single SIP Resource-Priority header or across multiple SIP
   Resource-Priority headers.  However, it is not necessary to sign all
   content of a SIP Resource-Priority header or all SIP Resource-
   Priority headers in a given SIP message.  An authority is only
   responsible for signing the content of a SIP Resource-Priority header
   for which it has authority (e.g., a specific "namespace "."
   r-priority").

4.2.  Verification Service Behavior

   [I-D.ietf-stir-rfc4474bis] Section 6.2 Step 5 requires that
   specifications defining "ppt" values describe any additional verifier
   behavior.  The behavior specified for the "ppt" values of "rph" is as
   follows:

   The verification service MUST extract the value associated with the
   "auth" key in a full form PASSPorT with a "ppt" value of "rph".  If
   the signature validates, then the verification service can use the
   value of the "rph" claim as validation that the calling party is
   authorized for Resource-Priority, which would in turn be used for
   priority treatment in accordance with local policy for the associated
   communication service.

   The verification service MUST extract the value associated with the
   "auth" key in a full form PASSPorT with a "ppt" value of "rph".  If
   the signature validates, then the verification service can use the
   value of the "rph" claim as validation that the calling party is
   authorized for Resource-Priority, which would in turn be used for

Internet-Draft                PASSporT-ext                     June 2017


   priority treatment in accordance with local policy for the associated
   communication service.

   In addition, [I-D.ietf-stir-rfc4474bis] Section 6.2 Step 4 requires
   "iat" value in "rph" claim to be verified.

   The behavior of a SIP UAs upon receiving an INVITE containing a
   PASSporT object with a "rph" claim will largely remain a matter of
   implementation policy for the specific communication service.  In
   most cases,implementations would act based on confidence in the
   veracity of this information.

5.  Further Information Associated with Resource-Priority

   There may be additional information about the calling party or the
   call that could be relevant to authorization for Resource-Priority.
   This may include information related to the device subscription of
   the caller, or to any institutions that the caller or device is
   associated with, or even categories of institutions.  All of these
   data elements would benefit from the secure attestations provided by
   the STIR and PASSporT frameworks.  The specification of the "rph"
   claim could entail the optional presence of one or more such
   additional information fields.

   A new IANA registry has been defined to hold potential values of the
   "rph" array; see Section 8.3.  Details of extensions to the "rph"
   claim to encompass other data elements are left for future version of
   this specification.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  JSON Web Token Claims Registration

   o  Claim Name: "rph"

   o  Claim Description: Resource Priority Header

   o  Change Controller: IESG

   o  Specification Document(s): Section 3 of [RFCThis]

6.2.  PASSporT RPH Types

   This document requests that the IANA create a new registry for
   PASSporT RPH types.  Registration of new PASSporT RPH types shall be
   under the specification required policy.

Internet-Draft                PASSporT-ext                     June 2017


   This registry is to be initially populated with a single value for
   "namespace" which is specified in [RFCThis].

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations discussed in [I-D.ietf-stir-rfc4474bis]
   in Section 10 are applicable here.

7.1.  Avoidance of replay and cut and past attacks

   The PASSporT extension with a "ppt" value of "rph" MUST only be sent
   with SIP when 'Resource-Priority' header is used to convey the
   priority of the communication as defined in [RFC4412].  A uniqueness
   of the set of token with extension claims and token signature is
   constructed using the originating identity being asserted with the
   "orig" claim along with the following two claims:

   o  "iat" claim should correspond to a date/time the message was
      originated.  It should also be within a relative time that is
      reasonable for clock drift and transmission time characteristics
      associated with the application using the PASSporT token.
      Therefore, validation of the token should consider date and time
      correlation, which could be influenced by signaling protocol
      specific use and network time differences.

   o  "dest" claim is included to prevent the valid re-use of a
      previously originated message to send to another destination
      party.

7.2.  Solution Considerations

   The use of extension to PASSporT tokens with ppt value rph based on
   the validation of the digital signature and the associated
   certificate requires consideration of the authentication and
   authority or reputation of the signer to attest to the identity being
   asserted.  The following considerations should be recognized when
   using PASSporT extension with "ppt" value of "rph":

   o  The use of this token should not, in it's own right, be considered
      a full solution for absolute non-repudiation of the identity being
      asserted.

   o  An authority (signer) is only allowed to sign the content of a SIP
      'Resource-Priority' header for which it has the right authority.
      The authority that signs the token MUST have a secure method for
      authentication of the end user or the device.

Internet-Draft                PASSporT-ext                     June 2017


   o  The verification of the signature MUST include means of verifying
      that the signer is authoritative for the signed content of the SIP
      'Resource-Priority' header.
