              DNSSEC Resource Record Should Include AAAA 
                    draft-byrne-v6ops-dnssecaaaa-00


Abstract

   DNS64 is a widely deployed technology allowing hundreds of millions
   of IPv6-only hosts to reach IPv4-only resources.  DNSSEC is a
   technology used to validate the authenticity of information in the
   DNS. Currently, there are scenarios where DNS64 and DNSSEC do not
   work well together. This document states that any DNSSEC signed
   resources record should include a native IPv6 resource record as the
   most complete and expedient path to solve any deployment conflict
   with DNS64 and DNSSEC.

INTERNET DRAFT    DNSSEC Resource Should Include AAAA       July 1, 2018


1  Introduction

   DNS64 [RFC6147] has documented scenarios where DNS64 may negatively
   interact with DNSSEC [RFC4033].  This document simply states the most
   complete and expedient path to avoid any negative interactions is for
   the DNSSEC signed resources to always include IPv6 AAAA resources
   records. As stated in [RFC6540], IPv6 [RFC8200] is not optional and
   failing to support IPv6 may result in failure to communicate on the
   internet, especially when DNSSEC signed IPv4-only resources are
   present.  

2. The Conflict Between DNS64 and DNSSEC

   DNS64 is a key part of widely deployed IPv6-only transition mechanism
   such as 464XLAT [RFC6877] and Happy Eyeballs Version 2 [RFC8305]. 
   Currently, hundreds of millions of host rely on DNS64 for access to
   the internet.  A core function of DNS64 is generating an inauthentic
   AAAA DNS record when an authentic AAAA DNS record for a host is not
   available from the authoritative namesever.  DNSSEC's fundamental
   feature is detecting and denying inauthentic DNS resource records. 
   While [RFC6147] outlines how DNS64 and DNSSEC may work in harmony,
   the preconditions may not always exist for harmony to be achieved  

3. Resolving the DNS64 and DNSSEC Conflict by Requiring AAAA

   DNS64 and DNSSEC are both important components of the current and
   future internet.  The limitation for how these protocols interact is
   unlikely to changes.  Deploying DNSSEC and IPv6 are both commonly
   achievable for a typical internet system operator using their own
   systems or using a third party service.  The resolution to the DNS64
   and DNSSEC conflict is to simply deploy both IPv6 and DNSSEC in
   tandem.  Deploying DNSSEC signed IPv4 resources records without
   matching IPv6 records is a risk and not recommend.  Ultimately, this
   guidance is simply restating [RFC6540] that IPv6 is mandatory for all
   internet systems.

3  Security Considerations

   DNSSEC is a good security practice.  Providing AAAA DNSSEC signed
   records wherever a DNSSEC signed A record is used ensures the  most
   effective use of DNSSEC.

4  IANA Considerations

   None.
