1. Terminology 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC-2119 [1]. 
    
    
2. Introduction 
    
   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, RFC 3761 [1]) is a system that transforms 
   E.164 numbers (The International Public Telecommunication Number 
   Plan, ITU-T Recommendation E.164 [2]) into domain names and then uses 
   DNS (Domain Name System, RFC 1034 [3]) delegation through NS records 
   and NAPTR records (Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Part 
   Three: The Domain Name System (DNS) Database, RFC 3403 [4]) to query 
   the services that are available for a specific domain name.

Internet-Draft            CNAM  Enumservice                April 2006 
 
 
   This document registers an Enumservice according to the guidelines 
   given in RFC 3761 [1], to be used for provisioning a NAPTR [4] 
   resource record to indicate a type of functionality associated with 
   an end point and/or telephone number.  The registration is defined 
   within the DDDS (Dynamic Delegation Discovery System [4][5][6][7][8]) 
   hierarchy, for use with the "E2U" DDDS Application defined in RFC 
   3761. 
    
    
3. IANA Enumservice Registration:  
    
   This Enumservice could enable service providers to place Calling Name 
   Delivery information into ENUM databases or to send ENUM queries to a 
   protocol converter that would have access to the SS7 Network.  This, 
   in turn, could enable such parties to offer Calling Name Delivery 
   services using the technology provided by RFC 3761.  
    
   The service parameters defined in RFC 3761 dictate that a "type" and 
   one or more  "subtype" should be specified.  Within this set of 
   specifications the convention is assumed that the "type" (being the 
   more generic term) defines the service and at least one of the 
   "subtype" defines the URI scheme. 
    
   In this document, one type is specified, "pstn" and one compound 
   subtype cnam:data with the URI scheme specified, 'data:', as 
   specified in RFC 2397 [9]. 
    
      
4. Definition of CNAM Data 
 
   Caller Display Name is a data string of up to 15 ASCII characters of 
   information associated with a specific calling party number [13] [14] 
   [15] [16] [17].  In the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) this 
   data is sent by the originating network only at the specific request 
   of the terminating network via a SS7 Transaction Capabilities 
   Application Part (TCAP) response message.    
    
    
5. IANA Enumservice Registration for PSTN Data "cnam" 
    
   Enumservice Name: "cnam" 
    
   Enumservice Type: "pstn" 
    
   Enumservice Subtypes: "cnam" 
    
   Enumservice Subtypes: "data" 
    
   URI Schemes: 'data:'

Internet-Draft            CNAM  Enumservice                April 2006 
 
 
    
   Functional Specification: 
    
   This Enumservice indicates that a resource record contains Calling 
   Name Delivery Information that can be addressed by the associated 
   'data' URI scheme [RFC 2397] in order to facilitate the display of 
   Calling Party information from a PSTN endpoint to a VoIP Client User 
   Agent or other application.   
    
   Security Considerations: See Section 9. 
    
   Intended Usage: COMMON 
    
   Authors: 
    
   Richard Shockey and Jason Livingood, et. al. (for author contact 
   detail see Authors' Addresses section) 
    
   Any other information the author deems interesting: 
    
   None 
    
    
6. Structure of CNAM data 
 
   RFC 2397 specifies the structure and parameters for the data URI as 
   follows 
 
   dataurl    := "data:" [ mediatype ] [ ";base64" ] "," data 
          mediatype  := [ type "/" subtype ] *( ";" parameter ) 
          data       := *urlchar 
          parameter  := attribute "=" value 
    
 
   Enumservice Privacy Responses and Parameters 
 
   The PSTN defines several values for CNAM data in the event that there 
   are restrictions or that the data is unavailable.  These are defined 
   as "Reason for Absence of Name" [R3-50] in GR-1188, consequently the 
   following responses to a query from a well known database are 
   reserved. 
    
   The data element "unavailable" is reserved for responses from the 
   well known database and two indicators are defined. 
    
   Calling Name Privacy Indicator 
    
   Definition: Parameter defined as the Calling Party does not wish to 
   have their Display Name displayed

   Usage: data:unavailable;cnp=p 
    
   Calling Name Status Indicator 
    
   Definition: for "not available/unavailable" defined as the well known 
   database has no data available for that particular E.164 number 
    
   Usage: data:unavailable;cns=u 
    
    
7. Distribution of CNAM Data 
    
   The distribution of CNAM data is often highly restricted.  The NAPTR 
   records described herein probably would not be part of the e164.arpa 
   DNS tree.  Distribution of this NAPTR data would be either (a) on a 
   private basis (within a service provider's internal network, or on a 
   private basis between one or more parties using a variety of security 
   mechanisms to prohibit general public access) or (b) openly available 
   on a national basis according to national regulatory policy.  
    
   The authors believe it is most likely that these records will be 
   distributed on a purely private basis.  If such data was distributed 
   nationally, a national regulatory body may have jurisdiction, 
   especially since CNAM information may contain Personally Identifying 
   Information [PII].  Such a body may choose to restrict distribution 
   of the data in such a way that it may not pass over that country's 
   national borders.  How PII data is collected, distributed and 
   subsequently regulated is out of the scope of this document. 
    
    
8. Enumservice CNAM Response Example 
 
   This section documents an example for illustrative purposes.  This 
   example shall in no way limit the various forms that this Enumservice 
   may take.  
    
   $ORIGIN 3.1.8.7.1.8.9.5.1.2.1.carrier1.example. 
      NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+pstn:cnam:data" 
      "!^.*$!data:Francois%20Marie20%Arouet!". 
    
   Escape codes are placed between names per URI formatting in RFC 2396 
    
   $ORIGIN 3.1.8.7.1.8.9.5.1.2.1.carrier1.example. 
      NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+pstn:cnam:data" 
      "!^.*$!data::unavaiable;cns=u !".

9. Example of E2U+pstn:cnam:data in Call Processing 
    
   Typically, the Caller Display Name in the PSTN is delivered to the 
   called party during the first long silence interval after the first 
   ringing [16] (see requirement R3-341).  If the Called party answers 
   the call before this, Calling Name may not be delivered.  . 
    
   This is an example of how a switch, proxy, or other calling 
   application may make use of this Enumservice type during the call 
   initiation process.  
 
Dialed Number  
      a) A PSTN user, say from +1-703-729-1234, which is connected to a 
         calling application, dials an E.164 telephone number: +1-215-
         981-7813. 
      b) The calling application uses the dialed number to form a FQDN 
         NAPTR query: 3.1.8.7.1.8.9.5.1.2.1.e164.arpa. 
      c) The DNS finds an E2U+sip record and returns a sip URI for 
         processing by the calling application: sip:+1-215-981-
         7813@carrier2.example;user=phone.SBC1.cox.net             
         SBC2.cox.net etc  
      d) A SIP invite is sent to the Called Party proxy at 
         carrier2.example. 
      e) The Called Party's SIP proxy/User Agent sees the SIP message 
         and before alerting the Called User, performs another ENUM 
         request using the E164 number in the SIP INVITE's From field 
         (i.e. +1-703-729-1234), and sends this query to a well known 
         database source for CNAM queries: 
         4.3.2.1.9.2.7.3.0.7.1.cnamedb.networks.example 
      f) Once the tel URI containing the CNAM data is returned from the 
         well-known database source, the Called party's proxy/User 
         Agent alerts the Called User about the incoming call and 
         includes the Calling Name in the SIP INVITE sent to the Called 
         User.  It then sends a "180 Ringing" message to the Calling 
         party's proxy, signaling the desire to establish the session.  
         At that point the Called Party's Client User Agent could 
         display the CNAM data. 
      g) Once the Called User decides to accept the call, the RTP 
         stream commences and the session begins. 
    
      NOTE: The above example describes in general the approach that 
      would be required by a terminating SIP UA/Proxy to acquire and 
      send CNAM information to the Called Party.  The exact mechanism, 
      determination of when to issue ENUM-CNAM request, and formatting 
      of SIP messages is beyond the scope of this document. 
    
    
10. SIP considerations

Internet-Draft            CNAM  Enumservice                April 2006 
 
 
   In those cases where SIP proxy's must carry CNAM data as P-asserted 
   identity fields as defined in RFC 3325 
    
 
11. Security Considerations 
    
   DNS, as used by ENUM, is a global, distributed database.  Thus, an 
   implementation of this Enumservice that uses e164.apra or any other 
   publicly accessible domain means that the information stored there is 
   visible to anyone anonymously.  While this is not qualitatively 
   different from publication in a Telephone Directory, it does open or 
   ease access to such data without any indication that such data has 
   been accessed or who has accessed it. 
    
   The CNAM ENUMservice defined in this document is assumed to be used 
   in an environment where elements are trusted and where attackers are 
   not supposed to have access to the protocol messages between those   
   elements.  Traffic protection between network elements is sometimes   
   achieved by using IPSec and sometimes by physically protecting the   
   network.  In any case, it is presumed the environment where the CNAM 
   request-response mechanism will be used can ensure the integrity and 
   the confidentiality of the contents of the CNAM data. 
    
   Carriers, service providers, and other users may simply choose not to 
   publish such information in a DNS tree, but may instead simply 
   privately exchange and publish this in their internal ENUM database, 
   which is only able to be queried by trusted elements of their 
   network, such as soft switches and SIP proxy servers. 
      
   An analysis of threats specific to the dependence of ENUM on the DNS 
   and the applicability of DNSSEC [13] to this is provided in RFC 3761 
   [1].  A thorough analysis of threats to the DNS itself is covered in 
   RFC 3833 [14]. 
    
    
12. Privacy Considerations 
 
   This document does not take into consideration issues of privacy as 
   it relates to Personally Identifying Information transmitted over IP 
   networks.  Service providers using this query response technique are 
   advised that many national jurisdictions have strict regulations on 
   the use of Caller Display Name data and that National Regulatory 
   Authorities may have special regulations that permit subscribers to 
   block the use of such data before call setup.  Other jurisdictions 
   have services known as anonymous caller rejection, meaning that calls 
   made from a system where Calling Line Identification and Caller 
   Display Name are blocked are prevented from establishing a session.

13. Internationalized Character Set Considerations 
 
   ANSI standards specify the use of ASCII for in the response to TCAP 
   queries for Caller Display Name.  This specification does not 
   preclude the use of internationalized characters for the 'cnam=' 
   parameter, nor does it preclude the use of more than 15 characters.  
   As a practical matter, however, it is recommended that the 'cnam=' 
   parameter be no longer than 64 characters.  
 
 
14. IANA Considerations 
 
   This document registers the 'cnam' Enumservice using the type "pstn" 
   and the compound subtypes "cnam" and "data" in the Enumservice 
   registry described in the IANA considerations in RFC 3761.  Details 
   of this registration are provided in sections 3,4 and 5 of this 
   document.

   specification can be obtained from the IETF on-line IPR repository at 
   http://www.ietf.org/ipr.
