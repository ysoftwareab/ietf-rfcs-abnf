<h1><br />Commentary on the Design of the Authenticated Encrypted Data Content Type<br />draft-schaad-smime-aed-rant-01</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>The Authenticated Enveloped Data Content Type allows for the use of Authenticated Enveloped modes with block cipher algorithms.  At the time of the original design there was discussion about the relative location of the authenticated attributes and the encrypted content in the ASN.1 structure.  With the benefits of implementation experience I revisit the discussion made  at the time and re-evaluate the decision made.

Introduction</h3>

<p>
        When the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) <a class='info' href='#CMS'>[CMS]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Housley, R., &ldquo;Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS),&rdquo; September&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> Authenticated Enveloped Data content type (defined in RFC 5083 <a class='info' href='#CMS-AED'>[CMS&#8209;AED]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Housley, R., &ldquo;Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Authenticated-Enveloped-Data Content Type,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>) was being discussed, the S/MIME working group had no actual implementation experience to guide it in some of the decisions that were being made at the time.  
        In this document I am revisiting one of these decisions based on the implementation experience that I have since garnered.
</p>
<p>Issues that were discussed at the time included:
        </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>What should the order be for the authenticated attributes, the encrypted data and the authentication code be in the ASN.1 structure.  There was uniform agreement that the authentication code should be last, however the placement of the other two fields was hotly disputed.  This is the issue that we further address below.
</p>
<p>Should we change from using a SET to a SEQUENCE for the attribute list.  Doing so would have simplified the encoding processing for hashing.  There was no support for doing this as a common routine exists that already worked for the signed and authenticated data structures.
</p>
<p>What are the security issues that deal with the timing of release of the encrypted content vs. the validation step.  This issue was addressed in section 2 with the statement "The recipient MUST verify the integrity of the received content   before releasing any information, especially the plaintext of the   content."
</p>
<p>Step 5 in section 2 says that padding needed to be done to the block length, however there was some concern that the issue of how padding should be done is better left to the algorithm description rather than being specified here.  No changes were made to address the issue.
</p>
</blockquote><p>
      
</p>
<p>The major focus of the discussions centered on the relative placement of the encrypted data blob (contained in  the authEncryptedContentInfo field) and the authenticated attributes (contained in the authAttrs field).  There were three different camps that emerged.  These where:  1) The attributes should be before the encrypted data, 2) The attributes should be after the encrypted data, and 3) There should be the ability to place the attributes both before and after the encrypted data and the encoder would choice which to use.  As can be seen from the ASN.1 in <a class='info' href='#ASN'>Figure&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>AuthEnvelopedData ASN.1 Extract</span><span>)</span></a> the final decision was to place the authenticated attributes after the encrypted content.  This was counter to the arguments that I made at the time to place the authenticated attributes before the encrypted content.

</p>
<p>The major part of my discussion focuses on the desirability to use a streaming model for processing the ASN.1 structure and the data contained within it.  If one does not want to use streaming in doing the processing, then much of the discussion here is moot.  If one is willing to buffer up all of the input to the encryption algorithm before applying it, the order that the inputs are presented are immaterial. This will be further detailed in <a class='info' href='#criteria'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>My Assumptions</span><span>)</span></a>.

Terminology</h3>

<p>The following is a list of standardized terms used in the document:
          </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>AE</dt>
<dd> is an abbreviation for Authenticated Encryption.  This is block cipher mode of operation which simultaneously provides confidentiality and integrity assurances on the data.
</dd>
<dt>AEAD</dt>
<dd> is an abbreviation for Authenticated Encryption with Auxiliary Data.  This is a block cipher mode of operation which simultaneously provides confidentiality and integrity assurances on the message data as well as integrity assurances on an additional set of data.
</dd>
<dt>Message Data</dt>
<dd> is the section of the input data that is to be authenticated and encrypted by the AE or AEAD algorithm mode. For CMS, the encrypted message data is placed in the encryptedContent field of the authEncryptedContentInfo sequence.
</dd>
<dt>Authenticated Data</dt>
<dd> is the section of input data that is to be authenticated but not encrypted.  For CMS, the authenticated data is the sequence in the authAttrs field.
</dd>
<dt>Authentication Tag</dt>
<dd> is a value that is generated by the mode which is used to validate the integrity of the data.  The Authentication Tag is sometimes implicit and does not exist as an independent value.  For CMS, it is assumed that the use of the algorithm will define an explicit tag and the tag will be placed in the mac field.
</dd>
<dt>Streaming Model</dt>
<dd> is a method of doing the processing such that the ASN.1 processing and the cryptographic processing can be interleaved with each other.
</dd>

Historic Arguments</h3>

<p>I have gone through the archived mailing list from the time to find the arguments that were being advanced.  The arguments are laid out with the pro side being for attribute being placed after the data except for the last item in the list.
</p>
<p>
        </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Consistency with the existing CMS data types:
            
<blockquote class="text">
<p>PRO:  We have working implementations of both AuthenticatedData and SignedData which work.  In both of these cases the data structures are ordered such that the message data precedes the authenticated data.  Keeping the order consistent makes coding easier and leads to fewer mistakes.
</p>
<p>CON:  Being constant is nice, however if it does not work correctly that does not matter.
</p>
</blockquote>
          
</li>
<li>Authenticated attributes may be derived from the message content:
            
<blockquote class="text">
<p>PRO: It should be possible to create authenticated attributes based on the content of the encrypted data and have these attributes authenticated.  Placing the attribute before the message content means that one must buffer the message content to do this. 
The example of this presented on the mailing list was the ability for a sender to process the body of the message on fly by a virus checker and publish the result of the virus checking as an authenticated attribute.  
This is the same thing that currently happens today for both SignedData and AuthenticatedData where the hash of the message data is computed on the fly and then placed in the signed/authenticated attributes which are then processed to compute the signature or mac values.

</p>
<p>CON: Placing this information after the message data means that the recipient cannot know to perform matching processing, if necessary, in order to check the value presented by the sender.  The analogous step for the SignedData structure is the need for the recipient to hash the message data during processing in order to correctly validate the signed attribute fields.
</p>
</blockquote>
          
</li>
<li>The decision should be dictated by Algorithm Characteristics:
            
<blockquote class="text">
<p>PRO: The order of placing the attributes before the message data was dictated by a specific choice of algorithms (CCM and GCM) and that other authenticated encryption algorithms (specifically CWC) would naturally place the attributes second.
</p>
<p>CON: No detailed analysis of algorithms was done.  However, the attribute data should be expected to be much smaller than the message data and thus it makes more sense to cache the attributes for later processing than to cache the message data for later processing.
</p>
</blockquote>
          
</li>
<li>Resource requirements for the sender and recipient:
            
<blockquote class="text">
<p>What happens with resource constrained devices that are acting as senders or recipients?  The initial argument dealt with the question of resource limited senders that would not be able to store intermediate data, but the same question applies to resource limited recipients.  We know that this was intended to be used with firmware upgrades as one option, but it could equally be used by a device sending out reports to a central server.  This is a case where a close analysis would need to be done on the algorithm being used and how it will affect the resources needed.
</p>
</blockquote>
          
</li>
<li>Relative frequency of processing:  
            
<blockquote class="text">
<p>There was a certain amount of discussion of the question of the relative frequency of processing between the sender and the recipient of a message.  This would have bearing on the question of which entity the decisions should be optimized for.  One set of people argued that recipients process messages more frequently than senders.  Another set of people argued that there exist applications where the sender may create messages that are never verified.
</p>
</blockquote>
          
</li>
<li>Attributes should be placed in both locations.
            
<blockquote class="text">
<p>There were a couple of people who attempted to argue that the discussions should be made by the sender of the message rather than by the object designers.  In this case we should have two different locations where the authenticated attributes could be place, either before or after the data, but only one of the two could be used.  The message creator would then select one or the other based on characteristics of their choosing.  Recipients would then be required to deal with the attributes occurring in either location.

Algorithm Taxonomy</h3>

<p>In item 3 in the previous section, one of the issues was what would a rigorous analysis of the AEAD algorithms lead us to believe about how the choice should be laid out.  At the time we were using only hearsay facts about what would make for a good choice.  In this section, I define a set of criteria that I will use to analysis the set of algorithms and then describe how each algorithm fits the criteria.
</p>
<p>NIST has been gathering information on Authenticated Encryption Modes over the last decade.  Information on these modes can be found at <a href='http://crc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/modes_development.html'>http://crc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/modes_development.html</a>.  For simplicity I used this as the set of algorithms to look at in order to characterize the requirements for the purposes of comparison with the characteristics required by the Authenticated Encryption data structure.
</p>
<p>In this section we will look at 11 AE algorithms from the NIST submissions along with an algorithm being developed by Peter Gutmann.  Since we are interested in how to setup a streaming model, the criteria we are looking at are chosen with that in mode.  The major characteristics we are going to be looking at are:

        </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>What are the parameters used for the algorithm?  This contains a list of the elements that are needed for processing exclusive of the key value.  These are the items that would need to be encoded in the ASN.1 parameters field of an AlgorithmInformation structure.
</li>
<li>What information is directly authenticated?  This is a list of the data which is directly authenticated in the order of authentication.  (It is possible that this list may change depending on the parameters.  Thus if HMAC-SHA1 is used, the length of the data is directly authenticated but it would not be if MAC-AES-128-CCBC was used.)
</li>
<li>What information is required before the first byte of message data can be processed?  Assuming that the first byte of message data is to be processed upon it being decoded from the ASN.1 (or encoded to ASN.1), what items of information are needed by the encryption/decryption algorithm prior to it being processed.
</li>
<li>What information is required before the first byte authenticated data can be processed?  Assuming that the first byte of authenticated data is to be processed upon it being decoded from the ASN.1 (or encoded to ASN.1), what items of information are needed by the encryption/decryption algorithm prior to it being processed.
</li>
</ol><p>
      
</p>
<p>NIST is currently in the middle of doing a review and selection process for new modes to adopt as US security standards.  For simplicity the set of algorithms that I will be looking at come from the current set of candidate algorithms that are being reviewed for this purpose.  One additional algorithm added to this is a simple hash and encrypt algorithm that has been proposed by Peter Gutmann.

</p>
<p>This algorithm mode provides major problems for a sender to process in a streaming model.  The lengths of the message data and the authenticated data are both required to be known before any bytes of the message data or authenticated data can be processed.  Except in cases where fixed length messages will be generated, it is required that the message data be cached prior to encrypting.
</p>
<p>This algorithm provides some problems for recipients in processing, but under the correct circumstances can be processed under a streaming model.  The length of the message data must be presented to the recipient before the message data is given.  The authenticated data must be presented before the message data is presented.  Optimal use of this algorithm would require that 1) the authenticated data be moved before the message data bytes and 2) a requirement be established that either the message data be DER encoded or the message data length be published as part of the authenticated data.  Given that this algorithm uses counter mode for encryption, the length of the message is already known so publishing it as part of the authenticated data would not leak any additional information.

My Assumptions</h3>

<p>This section will list the set of criteria that I am using in making my conclusions.  Again, the most important thing in my mind is the ability to implement a streaming model for encode and decode operations.
</p>
<p>
        </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>We want to implement using a single pass streaming module to encode and decode the structures.  There are many reasons to do so:
            
<ol class="text">
<li>The amount of resources used is minimized by not buffering the entirety of the message at each level of wrapping.
</li>
<li>The fact that not all messages are DER encode means that there is no single buffer in the original message that can be treated as a single input buffer.
</li>
<li>The message may be feed to the encoder/decode in chunks due to the way things are read from files, the fact that nodes in trees are emitted serially or the fact that removal of MIME content transfer encoding is normally done on small buffers.
</li>
</ol>

            
<blockquote class="text">
<p>There is one argument that says one should buffer up the entire encrypted buffer, decrypt in one chunk and then pass on the data in one piece.  Since the name of the algorithm class is encrypted and authenticated, one should perhaps actually authenticate that the data is correct prior to releasing the data for additional processing.

<p>I believe that it is sufficient to check that the encrypted buffer has been authenticated prior to acting on the data contained in the encrypted buffer.  Thus I believe it makes sense to continue doing the decode and either fail on the decode operation and propagate a failure up either when the decode itself fails or when the authentication check is actually made.  In this way it is no different than the processing of a signed message where the signature may be checked long after the message has been fully decoded.  In fact this is the normal case for an S/MIME client where the content is often viewable with some indication that the validation of the signature failed for some reason.

<li>The relative lengths of the data to be encrypted and the attributes to be protected are such that the encrypted data is generally much larger than the attributes.  Thus if one has to cache one in a streaming mode, it is preferable to cache the attributes.

Conclusions</h3>

<p>I now look again at the arguments presented in <a class='info' href='#history'>Section&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Historic Arguments</span><span>)</span></a> and review the arguments presented.  All of the opinions in this section are mine and may or may not be represent those of any other people.  <a class='info' href='#rebuttal'>Section&nbsp;6<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rebuttals</span><span>)</span></a> contains the opinions of other people.

<li>Consistency with the existing CMS data types:

</li>
<li>Authenticated attributes that are derived from the message content:
            
<blockquote class="text">
<p>This argument is slightly more believable than it was before I began this document as I now have an attribute which is derived from the message content, however this attribute is the length of the message data and in order to be useful it needs to be placed before the message data is consumed. (See <a class='info' href='#CCM'>Section&nbsp;3.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>CCM: Counter with CBC-MAC</span><span>)</span></a>.)
</p>
<p>I found this argument to be difficult to believe at the time it was presented, and I have not changed my mind since then.  The argument that this means the authenticated attributes comes second would mean that this is an attribute that is attested to by the sender, but is not verified in any way by the recipient.  If the recipient needed to do any processing then it would be much more desirable to have the attribute occur before the message data so that the recipient can setup to do the necessary processing prior to processing the message data.
</p>
<p>In the process of writing <a class='info' href='#XOR-HASH'>[XOR&#8209;HASH]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schaad, J., &ldquo;Experiment: Hash functions with parameters in CMS and S/MIME,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> I have become convinced that there is a fundamental problem which is going to be coming in the future with the signed data structure.  Since the recipient does not "know" the correct set of hash algorithms to be used when processing a message the vast majority look at the list presented and then augment it with a number of different algorithms.  This often means that one is computing four or five different hash functions on the content just on the off-chance that they may be needed.  Many systems will not attempt a recovery if they find a signer info structure which uses a hash algorithm they did not realize that they needed even if it is known to the system because of the work involved in doing a restart after having parsed in all of the data.  This means that similar behavior should be expected for any attributes that need to be validated by the recipient after having been generated by the sender.  The problem is worse since there is no similar field to the set of digest algorithms that can filled at the beginning of a signed data object.
</p>
<p>I believe that this criteria was mis-applied.  The issues of how a recipient was supposed to deal with these types of attributes was completely ignored in the decision process and it should have had paramount importance.
</p>
</blockquote>
          
</li>
<li>The decision should be dictated by Algorithm Characteristics:
            
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Looking at the taxonomy of algorithms that is presented in <a class='info' href='#algs'>Section&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Algorithm Taxonomy</span><span>)</span></a> we come up with the following results:
                </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>The algorithms which cannot be easily streamed are: CCM, SIV (for sender)
</p>
<p>The algorithms which need attributes before the message body are: CWC (serialized implementation), GCM, SIV (for recipient), CCM (for recipient in special circumstances)
</p>
<p>The algorithms which need the message body before the attributes are: MAC-Authenticated
</p>
<p>The algorithms which can have either the body or the attributes first are: CWC (parallelized implementation), EAX, OCB
</p>
</blockquote>
              

<p>We can see that CCM and SIV will never be easily streamed for the sender. It is unfortunate for people wanting to stream the CCM is one of the two algorithms that we have standardized on.  It should be noted that both of these algorithms can be setup to be streamed for the recipient of the message, but CCM requires an additional restriction to be applied.  If either of these algorithms is used then the entire question discussed above about a sender processing the content on sending would be academic as the message data needs to be buffered anyway.
</p>
<p>We have only one algorithm were the attributes are logically placed after the message data, that being the MAC-Authenticated, which was explicitly designed to be that way so that it could be streamed using the current data layout.  Additionally there are two algorithms that are agnostic of the order of attributes and data plus one that can be implemented to be agnostic.
</p>
<p>For recipients, only the MAC-Authenticated algorithm necessitates that the attributes be cached until the message data has been processed.  All of the other algorithms can be made work with the attributes preceding the message data without any problems.
</p>
<p>If we had done this analysis at the time the decision was made then we should have made the decision to place the attributes first.
</p>
</blockquote>
          
</li>
<li>Resource requirements for the sender and recipient:
            
<blockquote class="text">
<p>It is no more likely that the sender of a message is resource constrained than it is for the recipient of the message to be resource constrained.  This means that it is better for a set of algorithms and layout to be chosen that will work well in a streaming model under normal circumstances than to optimize for either the sender or the recipient.
</p>
</blockquote>
          
</li>
<li>Relative frequency of processing:  
            
<blockquote class="text">
<p>In my opinion, most of the time messages that are created using an authenticated encryption algorithm will be decrypted by at least one recipient.  Messages which are not decrypted will exist, either from being lost in the ether or from being cached until needed, but these will be the smallest part of the set.  Messages which need to be decrypted multiple times by a single recipient will generally be a small number as well, unless it because part of the S/MIME standard.  However I believe that a significant number of messages will be created that will have multiple recipients.  This may be done by creating multiple lock boxes up front, or by creating the lock boxes on demand in cases where it does not matter than a traffic analysis can be done that multiple recipients have gotten the same message.  (An example of this might be sending a firmware upgrade to multiple devices, where the message is transferred on demand and it does not matter that an observer can see that the same set of firmware is being installed on multiple machines.  This would be something that could probably be assumed anyway.)
</p>
<p>I therefore think that overall more messages will be decoded and decrypted than encrypted and encoded.  This would mean that a bias should be placed for the recipients of messages not the sender of messages in making decisions.

<p>Based on the above, I would say that we should modify the order of these fields in the event that the document is updated.
