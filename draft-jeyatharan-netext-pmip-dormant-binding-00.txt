   (e.g.  IEEE 802.11).  To eliminate packet loss and handoff delay due
   to disconnection of the unstable access, a dormant binding method is
   proposed access such that a binding is maintained in dormant mode in
   the network until the mobile node is disconnected from the unstable
   access.  Once activated, the binding allows the network to route data
   packets intended for the unstable access via the stable access
   connection.

Internet-Draft               Dormant Binding                October 2009


1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol (RFC-5213 [1]) allows a mobile node to be
   connected to the PMIPv6 domain via multiple interfaces and see
   different prefixes via different interfaces.  For example, one of the
   interface may be attached to a third generation cellular (3G) access
   which provides stable connectivity of moderate bandwidth.  Another
   interface may be attached to a wireless local area network (WLAN)
   such as IEEE 802.11 where the WLAN cells are sporadically dispersed
   and hence providing unstable connectivity of higher bandwidth.
   Ideally, the mobile node will want to reduce the handoff delay and
   packet loss due to the disconnection in the unstable access.
   Existing fast handoff mechanisms that address handoff delay related
   issues are highlighted in RFC 5268 [2] and ID-PFMIPv6 [3].

   These methods usually requires prediction of handover to achieve true
   seamless mobility, which is difficult to achieve for the unstable
   access, and is also unsuitable for the scenario where two connections
   are available, as described above.  This draft proposes a fast
   handoff mechanism, which we refer to as "dormant binding mechanism".
   In essence, it allows the mobile node to set up a binding between two
   accesses such that flows can be immediately re-directed from one
   access to another when the first access is disconnected suddenly.

   In this draft, we will first highlight the handoff issues in the
   environment where the mobile node has a stable access and looses
   connectivity via the unstable access in Section 2.  Following that,
   Section 3 gives an overview of the dormant binding operation.  In
   Section 4, the message format for messages are given and finally
   Section 5 highlights the operation of the architectural entities.


2.  Problem and Motivation

   To illustrate the problem, we consider the scenario where a mobile
   node MN has a cellular 3G access and a WLAN access connected to the
   PMIPv6 domain.  Normally, the MN would want flows to pass through its
   WLAN access for cost and bandwidth consideration.  Hence, the
   cellular interface is left in an idle mode whenever WLAN access is
   available.  When WLAN access is lost, session continuity is
   maintained by transferring the prefix given to the WLAN interface to
   the 3G interface.  The message sequence diagram in Figure 1
   illustrates this handoff using existing PMIPv6 mechanism.

       Figure 1: Handoff delay when flow transfer via Stable Access

   Initially, the mobile MN receives prefix P1 on its 3G interface via
   MAG1 and prefix P2 on its WLAN interface via MAG2.  At time t0, the
   WLAN access is lost, triggering MAG2 to send a de-registration PBU to
   LMA.  The mobile node MN will also send an access specific handoff
   trigger to MAG1 via its 3G access to indicate vertical handoff of
   prefix P2 to its 3G connection.  This will trigger MAG1 to send a PBU
   to LMA, which is received at time t2.  After checking the validity of
   this PBU, LMA accepts the proxy binding, and response with a PBA
   indicating the successful transfer of P2.  The mobile node can then
   start transmitting packets for session with P2 once it sees the
   prefix P2 advertised on its cellular interface at time t3.

   We can see that from time t0 ~ t3, the mobile node MN cannot transmit
   any packets for session with prefix P2.  This is called the outgoing
   handoff delay.  Also, any incoming packets arriving from time t0 ~ t1
   at LMA will be delivered to MAG2 and thus be discarded.  If the LMA
   does not perform packet buffering, the packet loss vulnerable period
   will be extended to time t2.  If MAG2 does not detect the loss of
   access or does not send the optional de-registration PBU, the packet
   loss vulnerable period will also be extended to time t2.

   We note that the outgoing handoff delay t0 ~ t3 and the incoming
   packet loss period t0 ~ t1/t2 is too excessive considering that the
   mobile node has an alternate route to the LMA -- that is via the
   stable 3G connection.  The motivation for the dormant binding
   mechanism is to reduce these time periods as much as possible.  To
   achieve this, the dormant binding mechanism has some important design
   features.  Firstly, a binding is set-up well before disconnection so
   that the network entities (MAG and LMA) knows where to transfer the
   flows should a disconnection event take place.  Secondly, the

   triggering rules for fast handoff mechanism is very clearly defined
   such that when the disconnection happens, both MAG2 and LMA will
   immediately starts forwarding the data packets received to MAG1.  The
   overview of how this can be achieved is described next.


3.  Overview of Dormant Binding

3.1.  Dormant Binding Operation when Disconnection via Unstable Access

   Here, we use the same scenario as described in Section 2 to
   illustrate the operation of the dormant binding mechanism.  Figure 2

         Figure 2: Dormant Binding Operation during Disconnection

   When the mobile node MN decides to set up a dormant binding, it will
   send an access-specific indication to MAG2 for the dormant binding of
   P2 to P1.  Since MAG2 does not know which mobile access gateway is
   proxying for the prefix P1, it will need to ask the LMA.  Hence, a
   new PMIPv6 message called the Dormant Binding Update (DBU) is sent
   from MAG2 to LMA.  This DBU serves two purposes.  Firstly, it allows
   MAG2 to query the LMA which node is proxying for prefix P1.
   Secondly, it is also used to set up a dormant binding of P2 to P1 at
   the LMA.  Hence, whenever the mobile node sets up a dormant binding
   at its MAG, the dormant binding is actually registered in two nodes:
   the MAG and the LMA.

Internet-Draft               Dormant Binding                October 2009


   Once the LMA accepts the dormant binding, it replies with a Dormant
   Binding Acknowledgement (DBA).  This will carries the address of the
   MAG that is currently proxying for prefix P1 (i.e.  MAG1).  From this
   DBA, MAG2 will know which node to forward packets to should the
   dormant binding be triggered.

   Consider that some time later, the WLAN access gets disconnected.
   Once MAG2 detects the disconnection, in addition to sending a de-
   registration PBU to LMA, MAG2 will also activates the dormant
   binding.  Hence when an incoming packet (say, Data1) arrives at MAG2
   after the dormant binding is activated, MAG2 will forward the packet
   Data1 to MAG1 for delivery.

   The de-registration PBU will also act as a trigger to activate the
   dormant binding registered at LMA.  Hence, without having to wait for
   the PBU with HI=2 to be sent by MAG1 (not shown in Figure 2), the LMA
   can immediately send an Unsolicited Proxy Binding Acknowledgement
   (PBA) to transfer prefix P2 to MAG1.

3.2.  Dormant Binding Operation when there is change in MAG

   Although unlikely in the usual scenario, it is possible for the
   mobile node to experience a handover of mobile access gateways for
   its stable interface.  In this case, the dormant binding registered
   at the MAG of the unstable access needs to be updated.  Figure 3
   illustrates how this is done.

           Figure 3: Dormant Binding Operation during MAG Change

   When a handover of MAG occurs, MAG3 will send a PBU with HI=3 to LMA
   to complete the horizontal handoff.  The LMA will perform two actions
   upon receiving this PBU.  Firstly, it will respond with a PBA as
   specified in PMIPv6.  Secondly, since there is a dormant binding
   registered for P2 to P1, it will notify the MAG that is currently
   proxying for P2 that the dormant binding target has changed.  Hence,
   an Unsolicited DBA will be sent to MAG2 to inform MAG2 that the
   dormant binding target is now MAG3.


4.  Message Formats

   This section highlights the message formats for the new messages that
   were mentioned in Section 3.  The new messages are the DBU, DBA,
   Unsolicited PBA and Unsolicited DBA messages described in Section 3.
   The dormant binding indication originating from the mobile node is
   considered access specific and is not defined in this draft.

4.1.  Dormant Binding Update (DBU) Message

   The DBU message is sent from the MAG to the LMA.  It is a normal PBU
   message as defined in RFC-5213 [1] with a new mobility option called
   the Dormant Binding mobility option attached.  As mentioned
   previously, this message is used to establish dormant binding at LMA
   and also used to create fast handoff tunnel between the MAGs
   connected to the interfaces of the mobile node.  This new dormant
   binding mobility option carries the mobile node's stable 3G interface
   IP address.  The Dormant Binding mobility option is shown in
   Figure 4.  The DBU message contains the mandatory mobility options
   such as mobile node identifier option (MN-ID), home network prefix
   option (HNP), access technology type option (ATT) and handoff
   indicator (HI) option in addition to the new DBU mobility option.
   Description of these mandatory mobility options are given in RFC-5213
   [1].

   The Unsolicited PBA message is sent by the LMA to the MAG connected
   to the stable interface of the mobile node.  This message is used to
   inform the MAG that an additional prefix (specified in a Home Network
   Prefix option in the Unsolicited PBA message) is being transferred to
   the connection proxied by the MAG.  The Unsolicited PBA message is
   represented as a normal PBA message with a new 'U' bit in the
   reserved field of the PBA message to indicate that this is an
   Unsolicited acknowledgement from LMA.  The Unsolicited PBA message
   also contains a HNP option and this option is used to carry the

      Binding Update.  A value of less than 128 will be used.

   Unsolicited Flag

      The "U" bit when set to value "1" indicates that the PBA is an
      Unsolicited PBA and sequence number matching need not be done by
      the MAG.

   Mobility Options

      The mobility options attached to the Unsolicited DBA message are
      the Dormant Target Address mobility option and the MN-ID mobility
      option.


5.  Operation

   In this section, signaling and data related operations of MAG and LMA
   are described.

5.1.  Signaling and Data Related MAG Operations

   o  When the MAG attached to the unstable interface of the mobile node
      receives the dormant binding trigger illustrated in Section 3, it
      extracts the IP address embedded in the dormant binding trigger.
      Following which it sends a DBU message to LMA with the extracted
      IP address attached.

   o  The MAG attached to the unstable interface of mobile node will
      first process the received DBA message using the standard PMIPv6
      protocol mechanism.  Following which it will establish a tunnel



Jeyatharan & Ng          Expires April 19, 2010                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft               Dormant Binding                October 2009


      with the MAG whose IP address was obtained from DBA message.

   o  When disconnection of the mobile node is detected by MAG attached
      to the unstable interface of mobile node, it will trigger the
      dormant binding state and start the tunneling procedure for
      received data packets towards the stable access.

   o  When MAG connected to stable interface of the mobile node receives
      the Unsolicited PBA message, it will create a forwarding state for
      the prefix/address received in the Unsolicited PBA message.

   o  When MAG connected to unstable interface of the mobile node
      receives the Unsolicited DBA message carrying the new MAG address
      associated with the stable interface of the mobile node, it will
      create a new tunnel to the new MAG informed by means of the
      Unsolicited DBA message.

5.2.  Signaling and Data Related LMA Operations

   o  When LMA receives the DBU message, in addition to the standard
      PMIPv6 protocol related PBU validity check, it will further check
      whether prefix tied to the address embedded in the DBU message is
      a valid prefix tied to the mobile node.

   o  Once the prefix validity is confirmed and the address of the MAG
      that is proxying the prefix is identified, LMA will create a
      dormant binding cache entry.

   o  After creating the dormant binding cache entry, LMA will send the
      DBA message to the MAG.  The DBA message sent by LMA will have the
      address of MAG attached to the stable interface of the mobile
      node.

   o  If the disconnection trigger or dormant binding triggering event
      (example: de-registration PBU from MAG that is connected to
      unstable interface) is received by the LMA, LMA will activate the
      dormant binding cache to active state and send an Unsolicited PBA
      message to the MAG attached to the stable interface of the mobile
      node.

   o  If dormant binding cache is in active state, the LMA will tunnel
      data packets only via the MAG attached to the stable interface of
      the mobile node.

   o  If the MAG attached to the stable interface of the mobile node is
      changed due to handoff and the dormant binding cache is present at
      the LMA, LMA will send the Unsolicited DBA message to the MAG
      attached to the unstable interface of the mobile node and notify

      the changed MAG address.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This draft introduces two new mobility options -- Dormant Binding
   Mobility Option and Dormant Target Address Mobility Option -- whose
   type values need to be assigned by IANA.


7.  Security Considerations

   The DBU message, DBA message, Unsolicited PBA and Unsolicited DBA
   messages are tied to PBU and PBA signaling and thus the security
   considerations tied to PMIPv6 protocol as given in RFC-5213 [1]
   applies here as well.  Hence, there are no additional security
   mechanisms that are required to carry out the methods described in
   this draft.  However, the dormant binding indication is sent from
   mobile node to the MAG using L2 methods tied to the specific access
   type and it is considered that L2 specific mechanism will be used to
   ensure the integrity and authenticity of the dormant binding
   indication.
