               draft-sijeon-dmm-deployment-models-01.txt

Abstract

   This document presents available deployment models for distributed
   mobility management networks, consisted of mobility management
   functions: anchoring function, location management, and forwarding
   management functions defined in RFC7429.  Some of the functions are
   modified on a need to allow potential deployment scenarios support.

1.  Introduction

   This draft presents available deployment models consisted of mobility
   management functions defined in [RFC7429], for distributed mobility
   management (DMM) networks.  With the mobility management functions in
   [RFC7429], i.e. anchor function (AF), location management function
   (LM), and forwarding management function (FM), centralized mobility
   management solutions such as Mobile IP (MIP), Hierarchical Mobile
   IPv6 (HMIPv6), and Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) have been described and
   decomposed by functional aspects, trying to analyze gaps from
   distributed mobility management requirement [RFC7333].  In this
   draft, with the functions, we sketch and describe the deployment
   models for distributed mobility management networks, accommodating
   the possible DMM solutions as well as providing an insight to
   understand the potentials of DMM.  We also describe where the
   presented deployment models are substantiated with solution proposals
   submitted in DMM WG.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Following terms come from [RFC7429] with modified definition in the
   AF.

   Anchoring Function (AF) is defined as a combined control-plane and
   data-plane functions.  For the control-plane function, it allocates
   an IP address, i.e., Home Address (HoA), or prefix, i.e., Home
   Network Prefix (HNP) a mobile node, topologically anchored by the
   advertising node.  That is, the anchor node is able to advertise a
   connected route into the routing infrastructure for the allocated IP
   prefixes.  It also takes a data-plane anchor point where packets
   destined to the IP address or IP prefix allocated by the anchor
   should pass through.

   The AF can be deployed in a decoupled way, i.e. separated control
   plane and data plane.  In that case, following two terms - AF Control
   Plane (AF-CP) and AF Data Plane (AF-DP) - are used.  AF-CP is
   responsible of allocating the IP address and advertising a connected
   route for an associated terminal while AF-DP is responsible of
   anchoring received data packets destined to the IP address allocated
   by the anchor.

   Internetwork Location Management (LM) is a control-plane function,
   which manages and keeps track of the internetwork location of an MN.
   The location information may be a binding of the advertised IP
   address/prefix, e.g., HoA or HNP, to the IP routing address of the
   MN, or it may be a binding of a node that can forward packets
   destined to the MN.  Note that the LM could belong to the AF-CP, as
   it is done in several solutions, i.e. Mobile IP (MIP) and Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6).  However, in this draft, each function is
   indicated distinctively, as those functions could be deployed in
   different locations to allow advanced control and smooth evolution
   for DMM.

   Forwarding Management (FM) function performs packet interception and
   forwarding to/from the IP address/prefix assigned to the MN, based on
   the internetwork location information, either to the destination or
   to some other network element that knows how to forward the packets
   to their destination.  Following the FM definition in [RFC7429], it
   may be split into the control plane (FM-CP) and data plane (FM-DP).

3.  Deployment Models

   We specify and analyze expected use cases where the MN tries to
   initiate an application.

   Figure 1.  Distributed AM, LM, and FM functions (with centralized LM)

   In this deployment model, AF, LM, and FM functions are co-located in
   every mobility router deployed at edge.  This model can be called
   All-in-One for DMM.  Depending on the use of the central LM, the
   model can be distinguished into fully distributed or partially
   distributed.  In the partially distributed case, interface (a),
   between the centralized LM and the mobility routers shown in Fig. 1,
   is could be used for querying necessary mapping information by the
   edge mobility routers.  Interface (b), between the mobility routers
   shown in Fig. 1, is used for conveying control signaling messages to
   control a forwarding path between them.  Solutions following the
   given model could be [I-D.seite-dmm-dma][I-D.bernardos-dmm-pmip].

   Figure 2.  Distributed AF-DP, LM and FM functions with centralized
   AF-CP (+ LM)

   In this model, we distinguish AF with AF Control Plane (AF-CP) and AF
   Data Plane (AF-DP).  AF-DP is distributed with LM and FM into
   deployed mobility routers while AF-CP is centralized in a single
   entity, following a trend of separation of control and user plane for
   mobility management.  For an extensive scenario support, LM may be
   co-located with the AF-CP.  AF-DP is determined by the AF-CP.  One
   possible solution could be to use such as User-Plane Address option
   to deliver AF-DP IP address serving router or terminal should
   contact, as proposed in [RFC7389].  Interface (a) shown in Fig. 2 is
   used to control AF-DP function, with signaling messages or
   configuration information.  Interface (b) shown in Fig. 2 is used for
   establish and control the forwarding path between the mobility
   routers.

   Figure 3.  Distributed AF-DP and FM-DP with centralized AF-CP, LM,
   and FM-CP

   In the model, separation of FM Control Plane (FM-CP) and FM Data
   Plane (FM-DP) is applied with the separation of AF-CP and AF-DP.  The
   LM is located at the central entity.  Comparing D3 with D2, D3 can
   provide smooth and flexible forwarding path management between the
   AF-DP of an allocated IP address and the current serving router where
   the terminal is attached.  Interface (a) shown in Fig. 3 is used to
   control AF-DP and FM-DP function by the respective control functions,
   AF-CP and FM-CP, with signaling messages or configuration
   information.  [I-D.ietf-dmm-fpc-cpdp] presents a framework that can
   facilitate forwarding policy configuration, imparting a role and
   characteristics of a mobility router as well as configuring a
   forwarding path.  [I-D.matsushima-stateless-uplane-vepc] may be
   subject to D3 model, the control functions in vEPC delivers Route
   Update to EPC Edge Routers, to configure a data-plane routing path.
