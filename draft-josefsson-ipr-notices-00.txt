Abstract

   RFC 3978 disallow additional copyright notices in IETF Documents, but
   the running code within the IETF appear to be to ignore that rule and
   publish documents with additional copyright notices.  There are
   arguments for permitting additional copyright notices in IETF
   documents, and some are given in this document.  This document update
   the paragraph in RFC 3978 that discusses additional copyrights, to
   relax the requirement.

1.  Background

   RFC 3978 [1] contains the following in section 5.4:


        Additional copyright notices are not permitted in IETF
        Documents except in the case where such document is the
        product of a joint development effort between the IETF
        and another standards development organization or the
        document is a republication of the work of another
        standards organization.  Such exceptions must be
        approved on an individual basis by the IAB.

   Several RFCs have recently been published with additional copyright
   notices in them, beginning with RFC 4000 and forwards, the documenst
   are RFC 4122 [2], RFC 4226 [3], RFC 4287 [4], and RFC 4501 [5].

   RFC 4122 contains source code with three copyright notices and
   related copying conditions.  RFC 4226 contains source code with one
   copyright notice and related copying conditions.  In RFC 4287, the
   copyright notice is inside an example for the XML data format
   specified, and supposedly only cover that particular example.  RFC
   4501 contains a copyright notice and copying conditions on the text
   in the document.

   We believe the examples given here break the rule for good reasons,
   and that the rule be changed in light of the "running code" practice
   and our argumentation.

   A general reason why permitting additional copyright notices is that
   it enables IETF Documents to include source code that are licensed
   under various free licenses that typically require the copyright
   notice to be preserved.  If the copyright notice is removed, the
   license is violated, and the source code cannot be included in an
   IETF Document.

   Thus, we argue that the rule should be changed to permit additional
   copyright notices.


2.  Revised Section 5.4 of RFC 3978

   Replace the last paragraph in section 5.4 (reproduced in the previous
   section) with the following:


        Additional copyright notices are permitted in IETF
        Documents, to denote the owner of copyrighted material

        within the document.


3.  Process Consideration

   This document intentionally do not use nor update the text for
   section 5.4 in [6], to permit this document to move forward without
   waiting for [6].
