        Additional Criteria for Nominating Committee Eligibility
                 draft-carpenter-eligibility-expand-04

Abstract

   This document defines a process experiment under RFC 3933 that
   temporarily updates the criteria for qualifying volunteers to
   participate in the IETF Nominating Committee.  It therefore also
   updates the criteria for qualifying signatories to a community recall
   petition.  The purpose is to make the criteria more flexible in view
   of increasing remote participation in the IETF and a reduction in
   face-to-face meetings.  This document temporarily varies the rules in
   RFC 8713.

1.  Introduction

   According to [RFC8713], the IETF Nominating Committee is populated
   from a pool of volunteers with a specified record of attendance at
   IETF plenary face-to-face meetings.  In view of the unexpected
   cancellation of the IETF 107 and IETF 108 face-to-face meetings, the
   risk of future cancellations, the probability of less frequent
   meetings in future in support of sustainability, and a general
   increase in remote participation, this document defines a process
   experiment [RFC3933] of fixed duration to use modified and additional
   criteria to qualify volunteers.

   Also according to [RFC8713], the qualification for signing a
   community petition for the recall of certain IETF office-holders is
   that same as for the Nominating Committee.  This document does not
   change that, but see Section 6.

   The source for this is at https://github.com/sftcd/elig/ and PRs are
   welcome there.  Discussion on the eligibility-discuss@ietf.org list
   is also welcome.

2.  Term and Evaluation of the Experiment

   The cancellation of the in-person IETF 107 and 108 meetings means
   that the current criteria are in any case seriously perturbed for the
   next two years.  The experiment therefore needs to start as soon as
   possible.  However, the experiment did not apply to the selection of
   the 2020-2021 Nominating Committee, which was performed according to
   [RFC8788].

   The experiment will initially cover the IETF Nominating Committee
   cycle starting in 2021.  As soon as the 2021-2022 Nominating
   Committee is seated, the IESG must consult the current and previous
   Nominating Committee chairs and publish a report on the results of
   the experiment.  Points to be considered are whether the experiment
   has produced a sufficiently large and diverse pool of individuals,
   and whether enough of those individuals have volunteered to produce a
   representative Nominating Committee with good knowledge of the IETF.

   The IESG must then also begin a community discussion of whether to
   amend [RFC8713] in time for the 2022 Nominating Committee cycle, to
   prolong the current experiment for a second year, or to do neither.
   The IESG will determine and announce the consensus of this discussion
   in good time for the 2022 Nominating Committee cycle to commence.

3.  Goals

   The goals of the modified and additional criteria are as follows:

   *  Mitigate the issue of active remote (or rarely in-person)
      participants being disenfranchised in the NomCom and recall
      processes.

   *  Prepare for an era in which face-to-face plenary meetings are less
      frequent (thus extending the issue to many, perhaps a majority, of
      participants).

   *  Ensure that those eligible are true "participants" with enough
      current understanding of IETF practices and people to make
      informed decisions.

   *  The criteria must be algorithmic so that the Secretariat can check
      them mechanically against available data.

4.  Criteria

   There will be several alternative paths to qualification, replacing
   the single criterion in section 4.14 of [RFC8713].  Any one of the
   paths is sufficient, unless the person is otherwise disqualified
   under section 4.15 of [RFC8713]:

   *  Path 1: As per [RFC8713], the person has attended 3 out of the
      last 5 IETF meetings.  For meetings held entirely online, online
      registration and attendance counts as attendance.  For the
      2021-2022 Nominating Committee, the meetings concerned will be
      IETF 106, 107, 108, 109, and 110.

      -  This criterion has been retained for backward compatibility and
         expanded.

   *  Path 2: Has been a WG Chair or Secretary within the last 3 years.

   *  Path 3: Has served in the IESG or IAB within the last 5 years.

   *  Path 4: Has been a listed author of at least 2 IETF stream RFCs
      within the last 5 years.  An Internet-Draft that has been approved
      by the IESG and is in the RFC Editor queue counts.

5.  Omitted Criteria

   Certain criteria were rejected as not truly indicating effective IETF
   participation, or as being unlikely to significantly expand the
   volunteer pool.  These included authorship of individual or WG-
   adopted Internet-Drafts, sending email to IETF lists, reviewing
   drafts, acting as a BOF Chair, and acting in an external role for the
   IETF (liaisons etc.).  Since the criteria must be measurable by the
   Secretariat, no qualitative evaluation of an individual's
   contributions is considered.

6.  Possible Future Work

   *  Should we consider how many nomcom voting members qualify via
      which paths?  For example, would it be acceptable if all 10 nomcom
      voting members qualified via path 3 in one year?

   *  Combined paths (e.g., a person who partly satisfies Path 2 and
      Path 5); otherwise known as a "points system".  That seems to
      involve work/complexity either for the secretariat or for the
      volunteer.

   *  Tweaking the "time decay" in each of the path definitions that
      ensures recent participation is more highly valued.

   *  Separating the NomCom volunteer criteria from the recall
      petitioner criteria.

Appendix A.  Available data

   An analysis of how some of the above criteria would affect the number
   of NomCom-qualified participants if applied in August 2020 has been
   performed.  The results are presented below in Venn diagrams as
   Figure 1 to Figure 4.  Note that the numbers shown differ slightly
   from manual counts due to database mismatches, and the results were
   not derived at the normal time of the year for NomCom formation.  The
   remote attendee lists for IETF 107 and 108 were used, although not
   yet available on the IETF web site.

   A specific difficulty is that the databases involved inevitably
   contain a few inconsistencies such as duplicate entries, differing
   versions of a person's name, and impersonal authors.  (For example,
   "IAB" qualifies under Path 4, and one actual volunteer artificially
   appears not to qualify.)  This underlines that automatically
   generated lists of eligible people will always require manual
   checking.

   The first two diagrams illustrate how the new paths (2, 3, 4) affect
   eligibility numbers compared to the meeting participation path (1).
   Figure 1 gives the raw numbers, and Figure 2 removes those
   disqualified according to RFC 8713.  The actual 2020 volunteer pool
   is shown too.

   Figure 3 and Figure 4 illustrate how the new paths (2, 3, 4) interact
   with each other, also before and after disqualifications.
