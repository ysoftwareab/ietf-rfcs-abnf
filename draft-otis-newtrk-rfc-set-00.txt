Abstract

   With many RFC updates resulting in differing RFC designations, this
   creates difficulty when determining which RFCs are significant for
   use within a particular endeavour.  Grouping RFC into sets that
   embody a specific endeavour would permit a stable reference for those
   interested in discovering the related details at a later date.  To
   provide current information related to the detailed adoption of the
   endeavour, encompassed by the set of RFCs, a formulaic html link will
   retrieve information stored in an IETF managed Status database.  It
   is also hoped the RFC Errata information will be made available in

   the same manner.

   This document proposes developing an Extensible Markup Language (XML)
   structure to define a set of RFCs related to a specific endeavour.
   The set would be limited to RFCs that are inter-related and describe
   an isolated function.  The set should not attempt to encompass
   diverse applications which utilize a broad range of separable
   functions.  The intent of this document is to provide an optimal
   means for locating relevant information made increasingly difficult
   with a growing number or RFCs, updates, and corrections.  The
   expectation in this effort is that any RFC not found within some "set
   of RFCs" is no longer relevant to any current endeavour.  Being
   within a "set of RFCs" does not infer any designation, other than an
   RFC within the set is useful for some current endeavour.

Internet-Draft                     SRD                         july 2005


1.  Introduction

   The IETF has produced a large number of RFC documents.  These
   documents often are inter-related and may also emerge as a succession
   of attempts.  The large and often rapidly changing documents that
   follow hundreds of separate endeavours has caused RFC designators
   defined in [RFC2026] and [RFC1311] to poorly reflect current usage.
   Rather than revisiting this designation process, it is hoped that by
   providing a coherent organization using sets of documents, along with
   relevant inter-operational information contained within a Status
   database, reliance upon RFC designators can be reduced.  This could
   either spur better maintenance of the RFC designator approach, or
   perhaps the designator process could become supplanted by the set of
   RFCs Status database.  This draft does not wish to predict how this
   will develop, but simply outlines an evolutionary rather than a
   revolutionary approach for a more comprehensible organization of
   documents.  If this set descriptor strategy proves untenable or
   unuseful, it can be dropped, as it makes no other changes to current
   procedures.

2.  SRD Identification and References

   This document proposes that a new document series called Set of RFC
   Descriptors ("SRD").  These documents are comprised of Extensible
   Markup Language, XML [W3C.REC-xml-20040204], structures used for
   generating HTML, RSS, and plain-text outputs that link together the
   related RFCs.  The SRD documents would be managed under the direction
   of the IESG, where they would also establish procedures for updating
   the relevant SRD Status database, and hopefully include overview of
   the RFC Editor's Errata database.  Rather than publishing simple
   pointers in indexes as, e.g., the STD series, this document proposes
   that SRDs be created to encompass all useful RFCs.  This document
   also proposes a version of the SRDs be used in the initial
   development process, to allow an overview of Work-In-Progess, WIP,
   which may involve an extended work and approval time period.

   The SRD is identified by a combination of name and number in the form
   of {srd-name.serial-number}.  As a general rule, when an HTML or
   database link excludes the serial, version, or iteration number,
   through the use of scripts, it will automatically reference the
   current document.  This auto-generated link is to simplify link
   maintenance and to stabilize the SRD structures.  The name for each
   SRD is unique.  To utilize the infrastructure supporting database
   references for Status and Errata, an SRD being modified and not yet
   approved, will include a prefix to indicate this effort represents
   WIP.

   The WIP SRD is identified by a prefix added.  The prefix used for an

Internet-Draft                     SRD                         july 2005


   RFC-Set, while it is being modified, would be {'X'<iteration-
   number>'-'<group-identifier>'-'}.  If this document was modifying
   {foobar.2} by the working group 'newtrk', the first iteration would
   be {X0-newtrk-foobar.2}.  When the document becomes accepted at some
   point, it would become {foobar.3}.  The 'newtrk' represents a group
   identifier or possibly the name of an individual.  This group
   identifier permits simultaneous WIP SRD documents to be pending for
   approval.  Normally, an SRD is not allowed to reference an Internet-
   Draft, but there would be an exception made for a WIP SRD.  The WIP
   SRD can not receive approval until all referenced Internet-Drafts
   have also been accepted and replaced as RFCs.

   To establish comprehensive coverage of RFCs with the SRD XML
   documents, script generated relationships could automatically
   generate rough versions of these documents.  These automatically
   generated documents would be given to the most relevant working
   group, or a special working group dedicated to the task of making
   needed corrections.  Upon completion of this effort, only those RFCs
   deemed currently unused should be excluded from being found within
   some SRD document.

   Once SRD documents are established, the Working Group chair is
   responsible for ensuring the WIP version of all affected SRD
   documents accompany an Internet-Draft submitted to the Area Director
   for IESG action.  The WIP SRD and the Internet-Draft would be
   considered together through all review stages.  Of course, all
   referenced Internet-Draft acceptance must precede WIP SRD acceptance.

3.  XML Conversion Considerations

   XML and XSLT structures are used to create HTML, RSS, and Plain-Text
   outputs for establishing stable hyper-link references.  It is
   expected that as information is added to the Errata Database, the
   related HTML pages are regenerated to provide a means to
   intelligently include an Errata link, in the case where such errata
   information becomes available.  When there are empty or missing
   elements within the SRD document, those elements are automatically
   excluded from the HTML page as well.  The intent is to ensure a
   minimum amount of information is presented.

   This proposal is attempting to follow a similar process defined in
   [RFC2629] and assumes the reader is familiar with this document.  The
   SRD XML declaration begins with a reference to the DTD, XSLT
   [W3C.REC-xslt-19991116], processing options, and the "srd" element:

   <?xml version='1.0' encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!DOCTYPE srd SYSTEM "rfcxxxx.dtd" >
   <?xml-stylesheet type='text/xsl' href='rfcxxxx.xslt' ?>

Internet-Draft                     SRD                         july 2005


   <?srd sortrefs="yes"?>
   <?srd strict="yes" ?>
   <srd ... >
   ...
   </srd>

   The XML declaration and the following two lines of reference
   information should be treated as opaque strings and nothing should
   follow the "</srd>" tag.  Make sure that all elements are properly
   matched and nested.

4.  The srd element

   The "<srd ...>" tag at the beginning of the document, with a "wip"
   attribute, produces an interim working draft that may include
   references to Internet-Drafts.  However, when this attribute is
   removed by the RFC editor, a final SRD document is produced.

   <srd set="foobar.2" wip="0-newtrk">

   At a minimum, the "set" attribute should be present which indicates
   both the set name and version.  In the case of a WIP SRD, this
   version number would be of the current SRD being modified.  The other
   attribute is "wip" which specifies both the current iteration and the
   name of the entity making a change, as required when adding or
   modifying an RFC.  The srd information includes a sequence of
   elements being the title, description, srdDate, doc, core,
   extensions, guidance, obsoletes, experimental, and companion.  The
   Status database will provide a reference to an accountable entity for
   the SRD, where this is not included within the srd itself.

5.  The title element

   <title>
   Title describes the entire RFC set.
   </title>

   The title element represents the title for the entire SRD set.  This
   supplements the simple label used as a set reference.

6.  The description element

   <description>
   Description more fully describes the entire RFC set.
   </description>

   Description should be only a few sentences describing the RFC set.

7.  The srdDate element

   <srdDate>
   YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD
   </srdDate>

   The srdDate element provides the date when the RFC set was accepted
   for publishing.  The format for the date is specified as a complete
   date plus hours, minutes and seconds as specified in Date and Time
   Formats [W3C.NOTE-datetime-19980827].  The 'T' between DD and hh is a
   character used to separate date and time information.  The "TZD"
   represents the Time Zone Designator ('Z' or +hh:mm or -hh:mm).

8.  The docs element

   <docs>
   http://www.ietf.org/
   </docs>

   The docs element provides the base used to reference related
   documents.

9.  The core element

   <core>
   <?srd include="reference.RFC.9876" ?>
   <?srd include="reference.RFC.9875" ?>
   </core>

   The core element includes a list of references elements for RFCs as
   defined for use with [RFC2629].  These RFCs encompass the basic
   definitions.  For WIP SRDs, a reference to an Internet-Draft would
   take the form:

   <?srd include="reference.I-D.housley-binarytime" ?>

10.  The extensions element

   <extensions>
   <?srd include="reference.RFC.9912 ?">
   </extensions>

   The extension element includes a list of references elements for RFCs
   as defined for use with [RFC2629].  These RFCs encompass optional
   enhancements to the basic definitions.

11.  The guidance element

   <guidance>
   <?srd include="reference.RFC.9815" ?>
   </guidance>

   The guidance element includes a list of references elements for RFCs
   as defined for use with [RFC2629].  These RFCs encompass advice
   related to the deployment of the RFCs within the set.

12.  The obsoletes element

   <obsoletes>
   <?srd include="reference.RFC.9811" ?>
   </obsoletes>

   The obsoletes element includes a list of references elements for RFCs
   as defined for use with [RFC2629].  These RFCs encompass RFCs which
   have been replaced by the RFCs within the set.

13.  The experimental element

   <obsoletes>
   <?srd include="reference.RFC.9811" ?>

   </obsoletes>

   The obsoletes element includes a list of references elements for RFCs
   as defined for use with [RFC2629].  These RFCs encompass RFCs which
   are deemed experimental and relate to either core or extension RFCs.

14.  The companion element

   <companion>
   <?srd include="reference.SRD.srd-example.1">
   </compainion>

   The companion element includes a list of references elements for SRDs
   using the same structure as defined for use with [RFC2629].  These
   RFCs encompass optional enhancements to the basic definitions.

17.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies an administrative procedure for the IETF and
   hence does not raise any new issues about the security of the
   Internet.  However, the availability of the type of document
   described here may provide a convenient mechanism and repository of
   vulnerabilities and other issues that are discovered after RFCs are
   issued, but that do not justify updating (or for which resources are
   not available to update) the relevant RFC.  Having an obvious place
   to look for those notifications and discussions for relevant
   documents might enhance overall security somewhat.
