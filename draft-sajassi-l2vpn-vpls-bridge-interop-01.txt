   connectivity to both bridge and non-bridge types of CE devices. VPLS 
   is expected to deliver the same level of service that current 
   enterprise users are accustomed to from their own enterprise bridged 
   networks today or the same level of service that they receive from 
   their Ethernet Service Providers using IEEE 802.1ad-based networks

   1.        Overview 
    
   Virtual Private LAN Service is a LAN emulation service intended for 
   providing connectivity between geographically dispersed customer 
   sites across MAN/WAN (over MPLS/IP) network(s), as if they were 
   connected using a LAN. One of the main motivations behind VPLS is 
   its ability to provide connectivity not only among customer routers 
   and servers/hosts but also among customer bridges. If only 
   connectivity among customer IP routers/hosts was desired, then IPLS 
   solution [IPLS] could have been used. The strength of the VPLS 
   solution is that it can provide connectivity to both bridge and non-
   bridge types of CE devices. VPLS is expected to deliver the same 
   level of service that current enterprise users are accustomed to 
   from their own enterprise bridged networks [802.1D/802.1Q] today or 
   the same level of service that they receive from their Ethernet 
   Service Providers using IEEE 802.1ad-based networks [P802.1ad] (or 
   its predecessor û QinQ-based network).  
    
   When CE devices are IEEE bridges, then there are certain issues and 
   challenges that need to be accounted for in a VPLS network. Majority 
   of these issues have currently been addressed in IEEE 802.1ad 
   standard for provider bridges and they need to be addressed for VPLS 
   networks. This draft discusses these issues and wherever possible, 
   the recommended solutions to these issues. It also discusses 
   interoperability issues between VPLS and IEEE 802.1ad networks when 
   the end-to-end service spans across both types of networks, as 
   outlined in [VPLS-LDP].  
    
    
    
   2.        Ethernet Service Instance 
    
   Before starting the discussion of bridging issues, it is important 
   to first clarify the Ethernet Service definition. The term VPLS has 
   different meanings in different contexts. In general, VPLS is used 
   in the following contexts [Eth-OAM]: a) as an end-to-end bridged-LAN 
   service over one or more network (one of which being MPLS/IP 
   network), b) as an MPLS/IP network supporting these bridged LAN 
   services, and c) as (V)LAN emulation. For better clarity, we 
   differentiate between its usage as network versus service by using 
   the terms VPLS network and VPLS instance respectively. Furthermore, 
   we confine VPLS (both network and service) to only the portion of 
   the end-to-end network that spans across an MPLS/IP network. For an 
   end-to-end service (among different sites of a given customer), we 
   use the term ôEthernet Service Instanceö or ESI. 
    
   [MFA-Ether] defines the Ethernet Service Instance (ESI) as an 
   association of two or more Attachment Circuits (ACs) over which an 
   Ethernet service is offered to a given customer. An AC can be either 
   a UNI or a NNI; furthermore, it can be an Ethernet interface or a 
   VLAN, it can be an ATM or FR VC, or it can be a PPP/HDLC interface. 
    
     
   Sajassi, et al.                                            [Page 3] 
    
    
   draft-sajassi-l2vpn-vpls-bridge-interop.txt            October 2004 
    
   If an ESI is associated with more than two ACs, then it is a 
   multipoint ESI. In this document, where ever the keyword ESI is 
   used, it means multipoint ESI, unless it is stated otherwise.  
    
    
   An ESI can correspond to a VPLS instance if its associated ACs are 
   only connected to a VPLS network or an ESI can correspond to a 
   Service VLAN if its associated ACs are only connected to a Provider-
   Bridged network [P802.1ad]. Furthermore, an ESI can correspond to 
   both a VPLS instance and a Service VLAN if its associated ACs are 
   connected to both VPLS and Provider-Bridged networks. An ESI can 
   span across different networks (e.g., IEEE 802.1ad and VPLS) 
   belonging to the same or different administrative domains. 
    
   [MEF-Ethernet] defines an Ethernet Virtual Connection (EVC) as an 
   association of two or more UNIs, where the UNI is a standard 
   Ethernet interface and point of demarcation between Customer 
   Equipment and service providerÆs network. An EVC is either point-to-
   point or multipoint-to-multipoint. It should be noted that an ESI 
   cannot be directly compare to an EVC per MEF definition since an ESI 
   is associated with a set of ACs; whereas, an EVC is associated with 
   a set of UNIs. However, if one limits the ACs associated with a 
   given ESI to only UNIs, then for a multipoint connection, an ESI 
   corresponds to a multipoint-to-multipoint EVC. 
     
   An ESI (either for a point-to-point or multipoint connectivity) is 
   associated with a forwarding path within the service providerÆs 
   network and that is different from an Ethernet Class of Service 
   (CoS) which is associated with the frame Quality-of-Service 
   treatment by each node along the path defined by the ESI. An ESI can 
   have one or more CoS associated with it. 
     
   An ESI most often represents a customer or a specific service 
   requested by a customer. Since traffic isolation among different 
   customers (or their associated services) is of paramount importance 
   in service provider networks, its realization shall be done such 
   that it provides a separate MAC address domain and broadcast domain 
   per ESI. A separate MAC address domain is provided by using a 
   separate filtering database per ESI (for both VPLS and IEEE 802.1ad 
   networks) and separate broadcast domain is provided by using a full-
   mesh of PWs per ESI over the IP/MPLS core in a VPLS network and a 
   dedicated Service VLAN per ESI in an IEEE 802.1ad network.  
    
   Different Ethernet AC types can be associated with an ESI. For 
   example, an ESI can be associated with only physical Ethernet ports, 
   VLANs, or a combination of two (e.g., one end of the service be 
   associated with physical Ethernet ports and the other end be 
   associated with VLANs). In the VPLS terminology, unqualified and 
   qualified learning is used to refer to port-based and vlan-based 
   operation respectively. Based on this VPLS definition, it is not 
   clear how to classify a customer service where traffic from some of

   its sites (that is untagged and port-based) needs to be mapped to a 
   VLAN at another site. In general, the mapping of a customer port or 
   VLAN to a given service instance is a local function performed by 
   the local PE and the service provisioning shall accommodate it. In 
   other words, there is no reason to restrict and limit an ESI to have 
   only port-based ACs or to have only VLAN-based ACs. [P802.1ad] 
   allows for each customer AC to be mapped independently to an ESI 
   which provides better service offering to Enterprise customers. For 
   better and more flexible service offerings and for interoperability 
   purposes between VPLS and 802.1ad networks, it is imperative that 
   both networks offer the same capabilities in terms of customer ACs 
   mapping to the customer service instance.  
    
    
   2.1.          Attachment Circuits Mapping to an ESI 
    
   The following table lists possible mappings that can exist between 
   customer ACs and its associated ESI û this table is extracted from 
   [MFA-Ether]. As it can be seen, there are several possible ways to 
   perform such mapping. In the first scenario, it is assumed that an 
   Ethernet physical port only carries untagged traffic and all the 
   traffic is mapped to the corresponding service instance or ESI. This 
   is referred to as ôport-based w/ untagged trafficö. In the second 
   scenario, it is assumed that an Ethernet physical port carries both 
   tagged and untagged traffic and all that traffic is mapped to the 
   corresponding service instance or ESI. This is referred to as ôport-
   based w/ tagged and untagged trafficö. In the third scenario, it is 
   assumed that only a single VLAN is mapped to the corresponding 
   service instance or ESI (referred to as VLAN mapping). Finally, in 
   the fourth scenario, it is assumed that a group of VLANs from the 
   Ethernet physical interface is mapped to the corresponding service 
   instance or ESI.

   Bundling 
   =================================================================== 
    
   Note-1: In this asymmetric mapping scenario, it is assumed that the 
   CE device with ôVLAN mappingö AC is a device capable of supporting 
   [802.1Q] frame format. 
    
   Note-2: In this asymmetric mapping scenario, it is assumed that the 
   CE device with ôVLAN mappingö AC is a device that can support 
   [P802.1ad]  frame format because it will receive Ethernet frames 
   with two tags; where the outer tag is S-VLAN and the inner tag is C-
   VLAN received from ôport-basedö AC. One application example for such 
   CE device is in feature server for DSL aggregation over Metro 
   Ethernet network.  
    
   Noteû3: In this asymmetric mapping scenario, it is assumed that the 
   CE device with ôVLAN mappingö AC can support the [P802.1ad]  frame 
   format because it will receive Ethernet frames with two tags; where 
   the outer tag is S-VLAN and the inner tag is C-VLAN received from 
   ôVLAN bundlingö AC. 
    
   If a PE uses an S-VLAN tag for a given ESI (either by adding an S-
   VLAN tag to customer traffic or by replacing a C-VLAN tag with a S-
   VLAN tag), then the frame format and EtherType for S-VLAN shall 
   adhere to [P802.1ad]. 
     
   As mentioned before, the mapping function between the customer AC 
   and its associated ESI is a local function and thus when the AC is a 
   single customer VLAN, it is possible to map different customer VLANs 
   at different sites to a single ESI û e.g., no coordination is 
   required among different customer sites for that service instance 
   and each customer site can independently identify the same service 
   instance via a different VLAN pertinent to its local site. 
    
     
   Sajassi, et al.                                            [Page 6] 
    
    
   draft-sajassi-l2vpn-vpls-bridge-interop.txt            October 2004 
    
    
   When a port-based or a VLAN-bundling is used, then if the PE uses an 
   additional S-VLAN tag to mark the customer traffic received over 
   that AC as belonging to a given ESI, then that PE shall strip the S-
   VLAN tag before sending the customer frames over the same AC. 
   However, when VLAN-mapping mode is used at an AC and if the PE uses 
   S-VLAN tag locally, then if the Ethernet interface is a UNI, the 
   tagged frames over this interface shall have a frame format based on 
   [802.1Q] and the PE shall translate the customer tag (C-VLAN) into 
   the provider tag (S-VLAN) upon receiving a frame from the customer. 
    
    
   3.        VPLS-Capable PE Model 
    
   [L2VPN-FRWK] defines three models for VPLS-capable PE (VPLS-PE) 
   based on the bridging functionality that needs to be supported by 
   the PE. If the CE devices can include both routers/hosts and IEEE 
   bridges, then the second model is the most suitable and adequate one 
   and it is consistent with IEEE standards for Provider Bridges 
   [P802.1ad]. We briefly describe the second model and then elaborate 
   upon this model to show its sub-components based on [P802.1ad] 
   Provider Bridge model. Finally, we show how this model can be used 
   to support all the different services and AC mapping (both symmetric 
   and asymmetric) described in the previous section.   
    
   As described in [L2VPN-FRWK], the second model for VPLS-PE contains 
   a single bridge module supporting all the VPLS instances on that PE 
   where each VPLS instance is represented by a unique VLAN inside that 
   bridge module (also known as Service VLAN or S-VLAN). The bridge 
   module has at least a single ôEmulated LANö interface over which 
   each VPLS instance is represented by a unique S-VLAN tag. Each VPLS 
   instance can consist of a set of PWs and its associated forwarder 
   corresponding to a single Virtual LAN (VLAN) as depicted in the 
   following figure. Thus, sometimes it is referred to as V-LAN 
   emulation.

   The S-VLAN bridge component is always required and it is responsible 
   for tagging customer frames with S-VLAN tags in the ingress 
   direction (from customer UNIs) and removing S-VLAN tags in the 
   egress direction (toward customer UNIs). It is also responsible for 
   running the providerÆs bridge protocol such as RSTP, MSTP, GVRP, 
   GMRP, etc. among provider bridges within a single administrative 
   domain.  
    
   The C-VLAN bridge component is required when the customer Attachment 
   Circuits are VLANs (aka C-VLANs). In such cases, the VPLS-capable PE 
   needs to participate in some of the customerÆs bridging protocol 
   such as RSTP and MSTP. The reason that such participation is 
   required is because a customer VLAN (C-VLAN) at one site can be 
   mapped into a different C-VLAN at a different site or in case of 
   asymmetric mapping (as describe in the previous section), a customer 
   Ethernet port at one site can be mapped into a customer VLAN (or 
   group of C-VLANs) at a different site. 
    
   In scenarios where C-VLAN bridge component is required, then there 
   will be one such component per customer UNI port in order to avoid 
   local switching within the C-VLAN bridge component and thus limiting 
   local switching among different UNIs for the same customer to S-VLAN 
   bridge component.  
    
   The C-VLAN bridge component does service selection and 
   identification based on C-VLAN tags. Each frame from the customer 
   device is assigned to a C-VLAN and presented at one or more internal 
   port-based interfaces, each supporting a single service instance 
   that the customer desires to carry that C-VLAN. Similarly frames 
   from the provider network are assigned to an internal interface or 
   æLANÆ (e.g, between C-VLAN and S-VLAN components) on the basis of 
   the S-VLAN tag. Since each internal interface supports a single 
   service instance, the S-VLAN tag can be, and is, removed at this 
   interface by the S-VLAN bridge component. If multiple C-VLANs are 
   supported by this service instance (e.g., VLAN bundling), then the 
   frames will have already been tagged with C-VLAN tags. If a single 
   C-VLAN is supported by this service instance (e.g., VLAN mapping), 
   then the frames shall not have tagged with C-VLAN tag since C-VLAN 
   can be derived from the S-VLAN. The C-VLAN aware bridge component 
   applies a port VLAN ID (PVID) to untagged frames received on each 
   internal æLANÆ, allowing full control over the delivery of frames 
   for each C-VLAN through the Customer UNI Port.  
    
    
   4.        CE Bridge Protocol Handling 
    
   When a VPLS-capable PE is connected to a CE bridge, then depending 
   on the type of Attachment Circuit, different protocol handling may 
   be required by the bridge module of the PE. [P802.1ad] states that 
   when a PE is connected to a CE bridge, then the service offered by 
    
     
   Sajassi, et al.                                            [Page 9] 
    
    
   draft-sajassi-l2vpn-vpls-bridge-interop.txt            October 2004 
    
   the PE may appear to specific customer protocols running on the CE 
   in one of the four ways: 
    
     i) Transparent to the operation of the protocol among CEs of 
        different sites using the service provided, appearing as an 
        individual LAN without bridges; or, 
     i     i) Discarding frames, acting as a non-participating barrier to the 
        operation of the protocol; or,  
     i     i      i) Peering, with a local protocol entity at the point of provider 
        ingress and egress, participating in and terminating the 
        operation of the protocol; or, 
     iv) Participation in individual instances of customer protocols.  
    
   For example, when an Attachment Circuit is port-based, then the 
   bridge module of the PE can operate transparently with respect to 
   the CEÆs RSTP/MSTP protocols (and thus no C-VLAN component is 
   required for that customer UNI). However, when an Attachment Circuit 
   is VLAN-based (either VLAN mapping or VLAN bundling), then the 
   bridge module of the PE needs to peer with the RSTP/MSTP protocols 
   running on the CE (and thus the C-VLAN bridge component is 
   required). There are also protocols that require peering but are 
   independent from the type of Attachment Circuit. An example of such 
   protocol is link aggregation protocol [802.3ad]; however, one can 
   argue that this is a media-dependent protocol as its name implies. 
   Therefore, the peering requirement can be generalized such that the 
   media-independent protocols (RSTP/MSTP, CFM, etc) that require 
   peering are for VLAN-based Attachment Circuit.   
    
   [P802.1ad] reserves a block of 16 MAC addresses for the operation of 
   C-VLAN and S-VLAN bridge components and it shows which of these 
   reserved MAC addresses are only for C-VLAN bridge component and 
   which ones are only for S-VLAN bridge component and which ones apply 
   to both C-VLAN and S-VLAN components. 
    
    
   4.1.          Customer Network Topology Changes 
    
   A single CE or a customer network can be connected to a provider 
   network using more than one User-Network Interface (UNI). 
   Furthermore, a single CE or a customer network can be connected to 
   more than one provider network. [L2VPN-REQ] provides some examples 
   of such customer network connectivity that are depicted in the 
   figure below. Such network topologies are designed to protect 
   against the failure or removal of network components with the 
   customer network and it is assumed that the customer leverages the 
   spanning tree protocol to protect against these cases. Therefore, in 
   such scenarios, it is important to flush customer MAC addresses in 
   the provider network upon the customer topology change to avoid 
   black holing of customer frames.

      Figure 3. Combination of Dual-Homing and Backdoor Links for CE

   The customer networks use their own instances of spanning tree 
   protocol to configure and partition their active topology, so that 
   the provider connectivity doesnÆt result in data loop. 
   Reconfiguration of a customerÆs active topology can result in the 
   apparent movement of customer end stations from the point of view of 
   the PEs. However, the requirement for mutual independence of the 
   distinct ESIs that can be supported by a single provider spanning 
   tree active topology does not permit either the direct receipt of 
   provider topology change notifications from the CEs or the use of 
   received customer spanning tree protocol topology change 
   notifications to stimulate topology change signaling on a provider 
   spanning tree.  
    
   To address this issue, [P802.1ad] requires that customer topology 
   change notification to be detected at the ingress of the S-VLAN 
   bridge component and the S-VLAN bridge transmits a Customer Change 
   Notification (CCN) BPDU tagged with the S-VLAN ID associated with 
   that service instance and a destination MAC address as specified in 
   the block of 16 reserved multicast MAC addresses. Upon receiving the 
   CCN, the provider bridge will flush all the customer MAC addresses 
   associated with that S-VLAN ID on all the provider bridge interfaces 
   except the one that the CCN message is received from.  
    
   Based on the provider bridge model depicted in figure (1), there are 
   two methods of propagating the CCN message over the VPLS network. 
   The first method is to translate the in-band CCN message into an 
   out-of-band ôMAC Address Withdrawalö message as specified in [VPLS-
   LDP] and the second method is to treat the CCN message as customer 
   data and pass it transparently over the set of PWs associated with 
    
     
   Sajassi, et al.                                           [Page 11] 
    
    
   draft-sajassi-l2vpn-vpls-bridge-interop.txt            October 2004 
    
   that VPLS instance. The second method is recommended because of ease 
   of interoperability between the bridge and the LAN emulation modules 
   of the PE.  
    
    
   5.        Partial-mesh of Pseudowires 
    
   The effect of a PW failure (resulting in creation of partial-mesh of 
   PWs) on the CE devices and their supported services should be well 
   known. If the CE devices belonging to an ESI are routers running 
   link state routing protocols that use LAN procedures over that ESI, 
   then a partial-mesh of PWs can cause ôblack holesö among the 
   selected set of routers. And if the CE devices belonging to an ESI 
   are IEEE bridges, then a partial-mesh of PWs can cause broadcast 
   storms in the customer and provider networks. Furthermore, it can 
   cause multiple copies of a single frame to be received by the CE 
   and/or PE devices. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to be 
   able to detect PW failure and to take corrective action to prevent 
   creation of partial-mesh of PWs. 
    
   [P802.1ag] defines a set of procedures for fault detection, 
   verification, isolation, and notification per ESI. However, these 
   procedures are not very suitable for detection and isolation of PW 
   failure for a number of reasons. 
    
   First, [P802.1ag] checks the integrity of a service instance end-to-
   end within an administrative domain û e.g., from one AC at one end 
   of the network to another AC at the other end of the network. 
   Therefore, its path coverage includes bridge module within a PE and 
   it is not limited to just PWs. Furthermore, [P802.1ag] operates 
   transparently over the full-mesh of PWs for a given service instance 
   since it operates at the Ethernet level (and not at PW level). 
    
   Second, [P802.1ag] assume that the Ethernet links or LAN segments 
   connecting provider bridges are full-duplex and the failure in one 
   direction results in the failure of the whole link or LAN segment. 
   However, that is not the case for VPLS instance since a PW consists 
   of two uni-directional LSPs and one direction can fail independent 
   from the other causing inconsistent view of the full-mesh by the 
   participating PEs till the failure is detected and propagated to the 
   other PEs.  
    
   [Rosen-Mesh] defines a procedure for detection of partial mesh in 
   which each PE keeps track of the status of PW Endpoint Entities (EEs 
   - e.g., VPLS forwarders) for itself as wells the ones reported by 
   other PEs. Therefore, upon a PW failure, the PE that detects the 
   failure not only takes notice locally but it notifies other PEs 
   belonging to that service instance of such failure so that all the 
   participants PEs have a consistent view of the PW mesh. The 
   procedure defined in [Rosen-Mesh] is for detection of partial mesh 
   per service instance and in turn it relies on additional procedure 
    
     
   Sajassi, et al.                                           [Page 12] 
    
    
   draft-sajassi-l2vpn-vpls-bridge-interop.txt            October 2004 
    
   for PW failure detection such as BFD or VCCV. Given that there can 
   be ten or hundreds of thousands of PWs in a PE, the scalability 
   aspects of this procedure needs to be worked out. Also [Rosen-Mesh] 
   acknowledges that many of the details regarding operational aspects 
   of such procedure are missing and need to be worked out. 
    
    
   6.        Redundancy 
    
   [VPLS-LDP] talks about dual-homing of a given u-PE to two n-PEs over 
   a provider MPLS access network to provide protection against link 
   and node failure û e.g., in case the primary n-PE fails or the 
   connection to it fails, then the u-PE uses the backup PWs to reroute 
   the traffic to the backup n-PE. Furthermore, it discusses the 
   provision of redundancy when a provider Ethernet access network is 
   used and how any arbitrary access network topology (not just limited 
   to hub-and-spoke) can be supported using the providerÆs MSTP 
   protocol and how the provider MSTP for a given access network can be 
   confined to that access network and operate independently from MSTP 
   protocols running in other access networks. 
    
   In both types of redundancy mechanisms (Ethernet versus MPLS access 
   networks), only one n-PE is active for a given VPLS instance at any 
   time. In case of an Ethernet access network, core-facing PWs (for a 
   VPLS instance) at the n-PE are blocked by the MSTP protocol; 
   whereas, in case of a MPLS access network, the access-facing PW is 
   blocked at the u-PE for a given VPLS instance.

                       Figure 3. Bridge Module Model 
    
   Figure-3 shows two provider access networks each with two n-PEs 
   where the n-PEs are connected via a full mesh of PWs for a given 
   VPLS instance. As shown in the figure, only one n-PE in each access 
   network is serving as a Primary PE (P) for that VPLS instance and 
   the other n-PE is serving as the backup PE (B). In this figure, each 
   primary PE has two active PWs originating from it. Therefore, when a 
   multicast, broadcast, and unknown unicast frame arrives at the 
    
     
   Sajassi, et al.                                           [Page 13] 
    
    
   draft-sajassi-l2vpn-vpls-bridge-interop.txt            October 2004 
    
   primary n-PE from the access network side, the n-PE replicates the 
   frame over both PWs in the core even though it only needs to send 
   the frames over a single PW (shown with ô==ö in the figure) to the 
   primary n-PE on the other side. This is an unnecessary replication 
   of the customer frames that consumes core-network bandwidth (half of 
   the frames get discarded at the receiving n-PE). This issue gets 
   aggravated when there are more than two n-PEs per provider access 
   network  û e.g., if there are three n-PEs or four n-PEs per access 
   network, then 67% or 75% of core-BW for multicast, broadcast and 
   unknown unicast are respectively wasted.  
    
   Therefore, it is important to have a protocol among n-PEs that can 
   disseminate the status of PWs (active or blocked) among themselves 
   and furthermore to have it tied up with the redundancy mechanism 
   such that per VPLS instance the status of active/backup n-PE gets 
   reflected on the corresponding PWs emanating from that n-PE. 
       
   The above discussion was centered on the lack of efficiency with 
   regards to packet replication over MPLS core network for current 
   VPLS redundancy mechanism. Another important issue to consider is 
   the interaction between customer and service provider redundancy 
   mechanisms especially when customer devices are IEEE bridges. If CEs 
   are IEEE bridges, then they can run RSTP/MSTP protocols, RSTP 
   convergence and detection time is much faster than its predecessor 
   (IEEE 802.1D STP which is obsolete). Therefore, if the provider 
   network offers VPLS redundancy mechanism, then it should provide 
   transparency to the customerÆs network during a failure within its 
   network û e.g., the failure detection and recovery time within the 
   service provider network to be less than the one in the customer 
   network. If this is not the case, then a failure within the provider 
   network can result in unnecessary switch-over and temporary 
   flooding/loop within the customerÆs network that is dual homed.  
    
    
   7.        MAC Address Learning 
    
   When customer devices are routers, servers, or hosts, then the 
   number of MAC addresses per customer sites is very limited (most 
   often one MAC address per CE). However, when CEs are bridges, then 
   there can be many customer MAC addresses (e.g., hundreds of MAC 
   addresses) associated with each CE.  
    
   [P802.1ad] has devised a mechanism to alleviate MAC address learning 
   within provider Ethernet networks that can equally be applied to 
   VPLS networks. This mechanism calls for disabling MAC address 
   learning for an S-VLAN (or a service instance) within a provider 
   bridge (or PE) when there is only one ingress and one egress port 
   associated with that service instance on that PE. In such cases, 
   there is no need to learn customer MAC addresses on that PE since 
   the path through that PE for that service instance is fixed. For 
   example, if a service instance is associated with four CEs at four 
    
     
   Sajassi, et al.                                           [Page 14] 
    
    
   draft-sajassi-l2vpn-vpls-bridge-interop.txt            October 2004 
    
   different sites, then the maximum number of provider bridges (or 
   PEs), that need to participate in that customer MAC address 
   learning, is only three regardless of how many PEs are in the path 
   of that service instance. This mechanism can reduce the number of 
   MAC addressed learned in a H-VPLS with QinQ access configuration. 
    
   If the provider access network is of type Ethernet (e.g., IEEE 
   802.1ad-based network), then the MSTP protocol can be used to 
   partition access network into several loop-free spanning tree 
   topologies where Ethernet service instances (S-VLANs) are 
   distributed among these tree topologies. Furthermore, GVRP can be 
   used to limit the scope of each service instance to a subset of its 
   associated tree topology (and thus limiting the scope of customer 
   MAC address learning to that sub-tree). Finally, the MAC address 
   disabling mechanism (described above) can be applied to that sub-
   tree, to further limit the number of nodes (PEs) on that sub-tree 
   that need to learn customer MAC addresses for that service instance. 
    
   Furthermore, [p802.1ah] provides the capability of encapsulating 
   customersÆ MAC addresses within the provider MAC header. A u-PE 
   capable of this functionality can reduce the number of MAC addressed 
   learned significantly within the provider network for H-VPLS with 
   QinQ access as well as H-VPLS with MPLS access. 
    
    
   8.        Multicast Traffic 
    
   VPLS follows a centralized model for multicast replication within an 
   ESI. VPLS relies on ingress replication. The ingress PE replicates 
   the multicast packet for each egress PE and sends it to the egress 
   PE using PtP PW over a unicast tunnel. VPLS operates on an overlay 
   topology formed by the full mesh of pseudo-wires. Thus, depending on 
   the underlying topology, the same datagram can be sent multiple 
   times down the same physical link. VPLS currently does not offer any 
   mechanisms to restrict the distribution of multicast or broadcast 
   traffic of an ESI throughout the network causing additional burden 
   on the ingress PE for unnecessary packet replication, causing 
   additional load on the MPLS core network, and causing additional 
   processing at the receiving PE where multicast packet is discarded. 
     
   One possible approach, to deliver multicast more efficiently over 
   VPLS network, is to include the use of IGMP snooping in order to 
   send the packet only to the PEs that have receivers for that 
   traffic, rather than to all the PEs in the VPLS instance. If the 
   customer bridge or its network has dual-home connectivity as 
   described in section 7, then for proper operation of IGMP snooping, 
   the PE must generate a ôGeneral Queryö over that customer UNIs upon 
   receiving a customer topology change notification as described in 
   [IGMP-SNOOP]. A ôGeneral Queryö by the PE results in proper

   snooping provides a solution for IP multicast packets and is not 
   applicable to general multicast data. 
    
   Using the IGMP-snooping as described, the ingress PE can select a 
   sub-set of PWs for packet replication; therefore, avoiding sending 
   multicast packets to the egress PEs that donÆt need them. However, 
   the replication is still performed by the ingress PE. In order to 
   avoid, replication at ingress PE, one may want to use multicast 
   distribution trees (MDTs) in the provider core network; however, 
   this comes with its potential pitfalls. If the MDT is used for all 
   multicast traffic of a given customer, then this results in customer 
   multicast and unicast traffic to be forwarded on different PWs and 
   even on a different physical topology within the provider network. 
   This is a serious issue for customer bridges because customer BPDUs, 
   which are multicast data, can take a different path through the 
   network than the unicast data. Situations might arise where either 
   unicast OR multicast connectivity is lost. If unicast connectivity 
   is lost, but multicast forwarding continues to work, the customer 
   spanning tree would not take notice which results in distribution of 
   its data traffic. Similarly, if multicast connectivity is lost, but 
   unicast is working, then the customer spanning tree will activate 
   the blocked port which will result in loop within the customer 
   network. Therefore, the MDT cannot be used for both customer 
   multicast control and data traffic. If it is used, it should only be 
   limited to customer data traffic. However, there can be potential 
   issue even when it is used for customer data traffic since the MDT 
   doesnÆt fit the PE model described in Figure-1 (it operates 
   independently from the full-mesh of PWs that correspond to an S-
   VLAN). It is also not clear how CFM procedures (802.1ag) used for 
   ESI integrity check (e.g., per service instance) can be applied to 
   check the integrity of the customer multicast traffic over the 
   provider MDT. Because of these potential issues, the applicability 
   of the provider MDT to customer multicast traffic is for future 
   study. 
    
    
   9.        Interoperability with 802.1ad Networks 
    
   [VPLS-LDP] discusses H-VPLS provider-network topologies with both 
   Ethernet [P802.1ad] as well as MPLS access networks. Therefore, it is 
   of paramount importance to ensure seamless interoperability between 
   these two types of networks. 
    
   Provider bridges as specified in [P802.1ad] are intended to operate 
   seamlessly with customer bridges and provide the required services. 
   Therefore, if a PE is modeled based on Figures 1&2 that includes a 
   [802.1ad] bridge module, then it should operate seamlessly with 
   Provider Bridges.  The issues discussed in this draft have been taken 
   into account.
