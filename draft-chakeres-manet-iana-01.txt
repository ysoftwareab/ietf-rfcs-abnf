1.  Introduction

   This document enumerates a port and two link-local multicast address
   assignments (one IPv4 and one IPv6) for MANET protocols.


2.  UDP Port for MANET Protocols

   To aggregate MANET routing protocol traffic it must be sent to the
   same IP destination address and the same port.  Therefore, all
   interoperable MANET routing protocol traffic should be sent to the
   same UDP port.  The proposed title for this port is "MANET".  In
   order to be interoperable, all packets sent to this port MUST conform
   to the packetbb specification [I-D.ietf-manet-packetbb].

                            UDP Port Assignment

                             +-------+-------+
                             |  Name | Value |
                             +-------+-------+
                             | MANET |  TBD1 |
                             +-------+-------+

                                  Table 1


3.  Link-local Multicast Group for MANET Routers

   MANET protocols need a link-local multicast address [RFC4291] to
   disseminate information.  This section proposes and names this link-
   local multicast address.

   The name of the multicast address to reach all link-local (LL) MANET
   routers is "LL MANET Routers".  MANET routers subscribe to this
   scoped multicast address and use it for link-local transmissions of
   routing protocol packets.

   For IPv4, a statically assigned, link-local scope multicast address
   is used.  The address for LL MANET Routers is 224.0.0.TBD2 to appear
   in the [IANAv4Multicast] registry.

   For IPv6, a statically assigned, link-local scope multicast address
   is used.  The address for LL MANET Routers is FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:TBD3
   to appear in the [IANAv6Multicast] registry.
