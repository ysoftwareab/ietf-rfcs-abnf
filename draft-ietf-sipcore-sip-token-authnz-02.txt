  Third-Party Token-based Authentication and Authorization for Session
                       Initiation Protocol (SIP)
                 draft-ietf-sipcore-sip-token-authnz-02

Abstract

   This document defines a mechanism for SIP, that is based on the OAuth
   2.0 and OpenID Connect Core 1.0 specifications, to enable the
   delegation of the user authentication and SIP registration
   authorization to a dedicated third-party entity that is separate from
   the SIP network elements that provide the SIP service.

1.  Introduction

   The SIP protocol [RFC3261] uses the framework used by the HTTP
   protocol for authenticating users, which is a simple challenge-
   response authentication mechanism that allows a server to challenge a
   client request and allows a client to provide authentication
   information in response to that challenge.

Internet-Draft    3rd-Party Token-based AuthNZ for SIP         July 2019


   OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] defines a token based authorization framework to
   allow clients to access resources on behalf of their user.

   The OpenID Connect 1.0 [OPENID] specifications defines a simple
   identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, which enables
   clients to verify the identity of the user based on the
   authentication performed by a dedicated authorization server, as well
   as to obtain basic profile information about the user.

   This document defines an mechanism for SIP, that is based on the
   OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect Core 1.0 specifications, to enable the
   delegation of the user authentication and SIP registration
   authorization to a dedicated third-party entity that is separate from
   the SIP network elements that provide the SIP service.


1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


1.2.  SIP User Agent Types

   [RFC6749] defines two types of clients, confidential and public, that
   apply to the SIP User Agents.

   o  Confidential User Agent: is a SIP UA that is capable of
      maintaining the confidentiality of the user credentials and any
      tokens obtained using these user credentials.

   o  Public User Agent: is a SIP UA that is incapable of maintainings
      the confidentiality of the user credentials and any obtained
      tokens.

2.  Authentication and Authorization flow

   This flow is used by a Confidential UA with rich UI to authenticate
   to an authorization server and to directly obtain tokens to be able
   to register and get service from the SIP network.


2.1.  Overview

   The following sections provide overview of the supported flows.


2.1.1.  Configured AS

   The following figure provides a high level view of flow of messages
   when the UA is aware of the AS ahead of time:

     UA                          Registrar                          AS
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   [00] The UA prompts the user to provides his credentials          |
     |                               |                               |

     |                               |                               |
     | [03] REGISTER                 |                               |

     |                               |    [04] HTTP POST /introspect |
     |                               |           {access_token}      |
     |                               |------------------------------>|
     |                               |                               |
     |                               |        [05] 200 OK {metadata} |

   In step [00], the UA collects the user's credentials with the AS.

   In steps [01] and [02], the UA first contacts the Authorization
   Server to authenticate the user and obtain tokens to be used to get
   access to the SIP network.

   The tokens returned to the UA depend on the type of server: with an
   OAuth Authorization Server, the tokens provided are the access token
   and refresh token.  With an OpenID Connect server, an additional ID-
   Token is returned, which contains the SIP URI of the user.  The
   method used to authenticate the user and obtain these tokens is out
   of scope for this document.

   In step [03], the UA starts the registration process with the SIP
   registrar by sending a REGISTER request with the access token it
   obtained previously.

   The registrar validates the access token, and if the access token
   provided by the UA is an opaque token, then the registrar MAY perform
   an introspection, steps [04] and [05], to obtain more information
   about the token and its scope, as per [RFC7662].  Otherwise, after
   the registrar validates the token to make sure it was signed by a
   trusted entity, it inspects its claims and act upon it.

   When the registrar is satisfied with the token, it then replies with
   the 200 OK to complete the registration process.

2.1.2.  Discovered AS

   The following figure provides a high level view of flow of messages
   when the UA discovers the AS to conatc from the registrar:

     |                               |        [14] 200 OK {metadata} |
     |                               |<------------------------------|
     |                               |                               |
     |                   [15] 200 OK |                               |

   In step [07] the UA starts the registration process by sending a SIP
   REGISTER request to the registrar without any credentials.  The
   REGISTER request includes an indication that the UA supports token-
   based autentication in the form of sip.token media feature tag.  The
   registrar then challenges the UA, in step [08], by responding with
   401 Unauthorized and includes the authorization server to contact to
   obtain a token.

   In step [09], the UA collects the user's credentials with the AS.

Internet-Draft    3rd-Party Token-based AuthNZ for SIP         July 2019


   In steps [10] and [11], the UA contacts the Authorization Server to
   authenticate the user and obtain tokens to be used to get access to
   the SIP network.

   The tokens returned to the UA depend on the type of server: with an
   OAuth Authorization Server, the tokens provided are the access token
   and refresh token.  With an OpenID Connect server, an additional ID-
   Token is returned, which contains the SIP URI of the user.  The
   method used to authenticate the user and obtain these tokens is out
   of scope for this document.

   In step [12], the UA retries the registration process with the SIP
   registrar by sending a REGISTER request with the access token it
   obtained previously.

   The registrar validates the access token, and if the access token
   provided by the UA is an opaque token, then then registrar MAY
   perform an introspection, steps [13] and [14], to obtain more
   information about the token and its scope, as per [RFC7662].
   Otherwise, after the registrar validates the token to make sure it
   was signed by a trusted entity, it inspects its claims and act upon
   it.


2.2.  Initial Registration

   If the UA has already obtained a token, then the UA starts the
   registration process, step [03], by sending a REGISTER request, with
   the access token in the Authorization header, to the registrar.

   If the UA does not have a token, then the UA starts the registration
   process, step [07], by sending a REGISTER request without an
   Authorization header.  The registrar MUST then challenge the UA by
   responding with 401 Unauthorized and include the WWW-Authenticate
   Response Header Field which includes the server to contact to obtain
   a token, as specified in Section 3

   The REGISTER request SHOULD include a sip.token media feature tag in
   the Contact header field of the request, unless it knows (e.g., by
   means of configuration) that the registrar supports the token
   authentication mechanism.

   The UA MUST include an Authorization header field with the Bearer
   scheme in the request to carry the access token, as specified in
   [RFC6750].

   When the registrar is satisfied with the token, it then replies with
   the 200 OK to complete the registration process.

Internet-Draft    3rd-Party Token-based AuthNZ for SIP         July 2019


2.3.  Subsequent Registrations

   All subsequent REGISTER requests from the UA MUST include a valid
   access token.  The UA MUST obtain a new access token before the
   access token expiry period to continue to get service from the
   system.  The method used to obtain a new fresh access tokens is out
   of scope for this document.

   The REGISTER request SHOULD include a sip.token media feature tag in
   the Contact header field of the request, unless it knows (e.g., by
   means of configuration) that the registrar supports the token
   authentication mechanism.


2.4.  Non-Registration Requests

   The UA MUST NOT insert a token in a non-REGISTER request, unless the
   non-REGISTER request has been challenged, or the peer is considered a
   trusted entity.

   If a non-REGISTER request from the UA is challenged with a WWW-
   Authenticate header field to provide credentials for the same realm
   specified in the challenge to the registration request, then the UA
   MUST include a valid access token in the request retry.  The UA MUST
   include an Authorization header field with the Bearer scheme in the
   request to carry the access token, as specified in [RFC6750].

   Challenges with WWW-Authenticate with different realm specified in
   the challenge to the registration request are out of scope for this
   document.  Challenges with Proxy-Authenticate are out of scope for
   this document.


3.  WWW-Authenticate Response Header Field

   This section describes the syntax of the WWW-Authenticate Response
   Header Field when used with the Bearer scheme to challenge the UA for
   credentials.

       challenge  =/  ("Bearer" LWS bearer-cln *(COMMA bearer-cln))
       bearer-cln = realm / scope / authz-server / error /
                    auth-param
       authz-server = "authz_server" EQUAL authz-server-value
       authz-server-value = quoted-string


   The realm and auth-param parameters are defined in [RFC3261].

Internet-Draft    3rd-Party Token-based AuthNZ for SIP         July 2019


   As per [RFC3261], the realm string alone defines the protection
   domain.  [RFC3261] states that the realm string must be globally
   unique and recommends that the realm string contains a hostname or
   domain name.  It also states that the realm string should be human-
   readable identifier that can be rendered to the user.

   The scope and error parameters are defined in [RFC6749].

   The scope parameter could be used by the registrar/proxy to indicate
   to the UAC the minimum scope that must be associated with the access
   token to be able to get service.  As defined in [RFC6749], the value
   of the scope parameter is expressed as a list of space-delimited,
   case-sensitive strings.  The strings are defined by the authorization
   server.  The values of the scope parameter is out of scope for this
   document.

   The error parameter could be used by the registrar/proxy to indicate
   to the UAC the reason for the error, with possible values of
   "invalid_token" or "invalid_scope".


4.  'sip.token' Media Feature Tag

   The sip.token media feature tag, when inserted in the Contact header
   field of a SIP REGISTER request, conveys that the SIP UA associated
   with the tag supports a token based authentication mechanism, where
   the user authentication and SIP registration authorization is
   performed by a third party.  The media feature tag has no values.

   token-mt = "+sip.token"



5.  Security Considerations

   The UAC MUST always make sure that it is communicating with the right
   registrar/proxy using TLS and proper validation of the server
   certificate and the identifier in that certificate to protect the
   access token in transit.

   If the token being used is a bearer token as specified in [RFC6750],
   then the security considration of that document apply.

   If the token being used is a JWT as specified in [RFC7519], then the
   security considration of that document apply.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  SIP Media Feaure Tag

6.1.1.  sip.token

   This section defines a new media feature tag that extends the "SIP
   Media Feature Tag Registration Tree" subregistry [RFC3840] under the
   "Media Feature Tags" registry (https://www.iana.org/assignments/
   media-feature-tags).

    Media feature tag name: sip.token

    Summary of the media feature indicated by this feature tag: This
        media feature tag, when inserted in the Contact header field
        of a SIP REGISTER request, conveys that the SIP UA associated
        with the tag supports a token based authentication mechanism,
        where the user authentication and SIP registration authorization
        is performed by a third party.

     Values appropriate for use with this feature tag: none

     Related standards or documents: RFC XXXX

     Security considerations: This media feature tag does not introduce
        new security considerations, as it simply indicates support for
        a basic SIP feature. However, if an attacker manages to remove
        the media feature tag from a SIP REGISTER request, the SIP UA
        that inserted it might not be able to authenticate itself with
        the SIP registrar to which the SIP request is addressed, as the
        SIP registrar might not be aware that the SIP UA supports the
        feature associated with the media feature tag.
