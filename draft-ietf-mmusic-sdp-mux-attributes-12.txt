            A Framework for SDP Attributes when Multiplexing
                draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-mux-attributes-12

Abstract

   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) provides mechanisms to
   describe attributes of multimedia sessions and of individual media
   streams (e.g., Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) sessions) within a
   multimedia session.  Typically media associated with individual media
   descriptions ("m=" lines) represent RTP sessions and are thus carried
   over individual underlying transport layer flows.  For scenarios
   where SDP is used to negotiate the usage of single 5-tuple for
   sending and receiving media associated with multiple media
   descriptions, it is required to understand the semantic implications
   of the SDP attributes associated with the RTP Media Streams
   multiplexed over a single underlying transport layer flow.

   The purpose of this specification is to provide a framework for
   analyzing the multiplexing characteristics of SDP attributes.  This
   specification also categorizes the existing SDP attributes based on
   the framework described herein.

1.  Introduction

   SDP defines several attributes for capturing characteristics that
   apply to the individual media descriptions (described by "m=" lines")
   and the overall multimedia session.  Typically different media types
   (audio, video, etc.) described using different media descriptions
   represent separate RTP sessions that are carried over individual
   transport layer flows.  However
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation] defines a way to use a
   single address:port combination (BUNDLE address) for receiving media
   associated with multiple SDP media descriptions.  This would for e.g.
   allow the usage of a single set of Interactive Connectivity
   Establishment (ICE) [RFC5245] candidates for multiple media
   descriptions.  This in turn has made necessary to understand the
   interpretation and usage of the SDP attributes defined for the
   multiplexed media descriptions.

   Given the number of SDP attributes registered with the [IANA] and
   possibility of new attributes being defined in the future, there is
   need for generic future-proof framework to analyze these attributes
   for their applicability in the transport multiplexing use-cases.

   The document starts with providing the motivation for requiring such
   a framework.  This is followed by introduction to the SDP attribute
   analysis framework/procedures, following which several sections apply
   the framework to the SDP attributes registered with the [IANA].

2.  Terminology

   5-tuple: A collection of the following values: source address, source
   port, destination address, destination port, and transport-layer
   protocol.

   3GPP: Third Generation Partnership Project; see http://www.3gpp.org
   for more information about this organization.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Motivation

   The time and complications of setting up ICE [RFC5245] and Datagram
   Transport Layer Security (DTLS) based Secure Real-time Transport
   Protocol (SRTP) [RFC5763] transports for use by RTP, and conservation
   of ports (to avoid maintaining large number of Network Address
   Translator (NAT) bindings open, reduce time/ports needed for ICE to
   detect connectivity), forms a requirement to try and reduce the
   number of transport level flows needed.  This has resulted in the
   definition of ways, such as, [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation]
   to multiplex RTP over a single transport flow in order to preserve
   network resources such as port numbers.  This imposes further
   restrictions on applicability of the SDP attributes as they are
   defined today.

   The specific problem is that there are attribute combinations which
   make sense when specified on independent "m=" lines -- as with
   classical SDP -- that do not make sense when those "m=" lines are
   then multiplexed over the same transport.  To give an obvious
   example, ICE permits each "m=" line to have an independently
   specified ice-ufrag attribute.  However, if the media from multiple
   "m=" lines is multiplexed over the same ICE component, then the
   meaning of media-level ice-ufrag attributes becomes muddled.

   At the time of writing this document there are close to 250 SDP
   attributes registered with the [IANA] and more will be added in the
   future.  There is no clearly defined procedure to establish the
   validity/applicability of these attributes when used with transport
   multiplexing.

4.  SDP Attribute Analysis Framework

   Attributes in an SDP session description can be defined at the
   session-level and media-level.  Informally, these attributes could be
   semantically grouped as noted below.

Internet-Draft         SDP Attribute Multiplexing           January 2016


   o  Attributes related to media content such as media type, encoding
      schemes, payload types.

   o  Attributes specifying media transport characteristics like RTP/RTP
      Control Protocol (RTCP) port numbers, network addresses, QOS.

   o  Metadata description attributes capturing session timing and
      origin information.

   o  Attributes establishing relationships between media descriptions
      such as grouping framework [RFC5888]

   With the above semantic grouping as a reference, the proposed
   framework classifies each attribute into one of the following
   categories:

4.1.  Category: NORMAL

   Attributes that can be independently specified when multiplexing and
   retain their original semantics.

   In the example given below, the direction and label attributes are
   independently specified for audio and video "m=" lines.  These
   attributes are not impacted by multiplexing these media streams over
   a single transport layer flow.

4.2.  Category: NOT RECOMMENDED

   Attributes that are not recommended for multiplexing since their
   usage under multiplexing might lead to incorrect behavior.

   Example: Multiplexing media descriptions over a single Datagram
   Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) transport [RFC5762] is NOT

   RECOMMENDED since DCCP being a connection oriented protocol doesn't
   allow multiple connections on the same 5-tuple.

4.3.  Category: IDENTICAL

   Attributes and their associated values (if any) that MUST be
   identical across all the media descriptions being multiplexed.

   Attributes such as rtcp-mux fall into this category.  Since RTCP
   reporting is done per RTP session, RTCP Multiplexing MUST be enabled
   for both the audio and video "m=" lines if they are transported over
   a single 5-tuple.

        a=rtpmap:31 H261/90000
        a=rtcp-mux

4.4.  Category: SUM

   Attributes can be set as they are normally used but software using
   them in the multiplexing scenario, MUST apply the sum of all the
   attributes being multiplexed instead of trying to use them
   independently.  This is typically used for bandwidth or other rate
   limiting attributes to the underlying transport.

   The software parsing the SDP sample below, should use the aggregate
   Application Specific (AS) bandwidth value from the individual media
   descriptions to determine the AS value for the multiplexed session.
   Thus the calculated AS value would be 256+64 kilobits per second for
   the given example.

         b=AS:256

4.5.  Category: TRANSPORT

   Attributes that can be set normally for multiple items in a
   multiplexed group but the software MUST pick the one that's
   associated with the "m=" line whose information is used for setting
   up the underlying transport.

   In the example below, "a=crypto" attribute is defined for both the
   audio and the video "m=" lines.  The video media line's a=crypto
   attribute is chosen since its mid value (bar) appears first in the
   a=group:BUNDLE line.  This is due to BUNDLE grouping semantic
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation] which mandates the values
   from "m=" line corresponding to the mid appearing first on the
   a=group:BUNDLE line to be considered for setting up the RTP
   Transport.

4.6.  Category: INHERIT

   Attributes that encapsulate other SDP attributes or parameters.
   These attributes inherit their multiplexing characteristics from the
   attributes or parameters they encapsulate.  Such attributes are
   defined in [RFC3407], [RFC5939] and [RFC6871] as part of a generic
   framework for indicating and negotiating transport, media, and media
   format related capabilities in the SDP.

   The inheritance manifests itself when the encapsulated attribute or
   parameter is being leveraged.  In the case of SDP Capability
   Negotiation [RFC5939] for example, this occurs when a capability
   (encapsulating attribute) is used as part of a configuration; the
   configuration inherits the multiplexing category of each of its
   constituent (encapsulated) attributes and parameters.  This in turn
   MAY place constraints on what constitutes a valid configuration from
   a multiplexing point of view, e.g. because some attributes MUST be
   IDENTICAL (see Section 14 for further details).

          a=cdsc: 2 video RTP/AVP 101
          a=cpar: a=rtcp-mux

   In the above example, the category IDENTICAL is inherited for the
   cpar encapsulated rtcp-mux attribute.

4.7.  Category: IDENTICAL-PER-PT

   Attributes that define the RTP payload configuration on per Payload
   Type basis and MUST have identical values across all the media
   descriptions for a given RTP Payload Type when repeated.  These
   Payload Types identify the same codec configuration as defined in the
   Section 10.1.2 of [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation] under this
   context.

   In the SDP example below, Payload Types 96 and 97 are repeated across
   all the video "m=" lines and all the payload specific parameters (ex:
   rtpmap, fmtp) are identical (Note: some line breaks included are due
   to formatting only).

4.8.  Category: SPECIAL

   Attributes where the text in the specification defining the attribute
   MUST be consulted for further handling when multiplexed.

   As an example, for the attribute extmap [RFC5285], the specification
   defining the extension needs to be referred to understand the
   multiplexing implications.

4.9.  Category: TBD

   Attributes that have not been analyzed under the proposed
   multiplexing framework.  For the purposes of implementations it is
   advised to consider "NOT RECOMMENDED" as the category when
   multiplexing these attributes.

5.  Analysis of Existing Attributes

   This section analyzes attributes listed in [IANA], grouped under the
   IETF document that defines them.

   The "Level" column indicates whether the attribute is currently
   specified as:

   o  S -- Session level

   o  M -- Media level

   o  B -- Both

   o  SR -- Source-level (for a single SSRC) [RFC5576]

   The "Mux Category" column identifies multiplexing category assigned
   per attribute and the "Notes" column captures additional informative
   details regarding the assigned category, wherever necessary.

5.1.  RFC4566: SDP

   [RFC4566] defines SDP that is intended for describing multimedia
   sessions for the purposes of session announcement, session
   invitation, and other forms of multimedia session initiation.

5.3.  RFC5761: Multiplexing RTP and RTCP

   [RFC5761] discusses issues that arise when multiplexing RTP data
   packets and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) packets on a single UDP port.
   It describes when such multiplexing is and is not appropriate, and it
   explains how the SDP can be used to signal multiplexed sessions.

   [RFC3312]  defines a generic framework for preconditions, which are
   extensible through IANA registration.  This document also discusses
   how network quality of service can be made a precondition for
   establishment of sessions initiated by the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP).  These preconditions require that the participant
   reserve network resources before continuing with the session.

   NOTE: A mismatched set of preconditions across media descriptions
   results in Session establishment failures due to inability in meeting
   the right resource reservations requested.

5.5.  RFC4574: SDP Label Attribute

   [RFC4574] defines a new SDP media-level attribute: "label".  The
   "label" attribute carries a pointer to a media stream in the context
   of an arbitrary network application that uses SDP.  The sender of the
   SDP document can attach the "label" attribute to a particular media
   stream or streams.  The application can then use the provided pointer
   to refer to each particular media stream in its context.

5.8.  RFC5762: RTP over DCCP

   RTP is a widely used transport for real-time multimedia on IP
   networks.  DCCP is a transport protocol that provides desirable
   services for real-time applications.  [RFC5762] specifies a mapping
   of RTP onto DCCP, along with associated signaling, such that real-
   time applications can make use of the services provided by DCCP.

                        RFC5762 Attribute Analysis

   If RFC6773 is being used in addition to RFC5762 and provided that
   DCCP-in-UDP layer has additional demultiplexing, then it can be
   possible to use different DCCP service codes for each DCCP flow,
   given each uses a different DCCP port.  Although doing so might
   conflict with the media type of the "m=" line.  None of this is
   standardized yet and it wouldn't work as explained.  Hence
   multiplexing MUST NOT be performed even in this alternate scenario.

5.9.  RFC6773: DCCP-UDP Encapsulation

   [RFC6773] document specifies an alternative encapsulation of DCCP,
   referred to as DCCP-UDP.  This encapsulation allows DCCP to be
   carried through the current generation of Network Address Translation
   (NAT) middle boxes without modification of those middle boxes.

   NOTE: RFC6773 is about tunneling DCCP in UDP, with the UDP port being
   the port of the DCCP en-/de-capsulation service.  This encapsulation
   allows arbitrary DCCP packets to be encapsulated and the DCCP port
   chosen can conflict with the port chosen for the RTP traffic.  For
   multiplexing several DCCP-in-UDP encapsulations on the same UDP port,
   with no RTP traffic on the same port implies collapsing several DCCP
   port spaces together.  This can or cannot work depending on the
   nature of DCCP encapsulation and ports choices thus rendering it to
   be very application dependent.

5.10.  RFC5506: Reduced-Size RTCP in RTP Profile

5.11.  RFC6787: Media Resource Control Protocol Version 2

   The Media Resource Control Protocol Version 2 (MRCPv2) allows client
   hosts to control media service resources such as speech synthesizers,
   recognizers, verifiers, and identifiers residing in servers on the
   network.  MRCPv2 is not a "stand-alone" protocol -- it relies on
   other protocols, such as the SIP, to coordinate MRCPv2 clients and
   servers, and manage session between them, and SDP to describe,
   discover, and exchange capabilities.  It also depends on SIP and SDP
   to establish the media sessions and associated parameters between the
   media source or sink and the media server.  Once this is done, the
   MRCPv2 exchange operates over the control session established above,
   allowing the client to control the media processing resources on the
   speech resource server.  [RFC6787] defines attributes for this
   purpose.

   [RFC6236] proposes a new generic session setup attribute to make it
   possible to negotiate different image attributes such as image size.
   A possible use case is to make it possible for a low-end hand-held
   terminal to display video without the need to rescale the image,
   something that may consume large amounts of memory and processing
   power.  The document also helps to maintain an optimal bitrate for
   video as only the image size that is desired by the receiver is
   transmitted.

5.25.  RFC6284: Port Mapping between Unicast and Multicast RTP Sessions

   [RFC6284] presents a port mapping solution that allows RTP receivers
   to choose their own ports for an auxiliary unicast session in RTP
   applications using both unicast and multicast services.  The solution
   provides protection against denial-of-service or packet amplification
   attacks that could be used to cause one or more RTP packets to be
   sent to a victim client.

   endpoints use to indicate support of the CEMA extension.

                       RFC6871 - Attribute Analysis

   NOTE: The "sescap" attribute is NOT RECOMMENDED for use with
   multiplexing.  The reason is that it requires the use of unique
   configuration numbers across the entire SDP (per [RFC6871]) as
   opposed to within a media description only (per [RFC5939]).  As
   described in Section 14, the use of identical configuration numbers
   between multiplexed (bundled) media descriptions is the default way
   of indicating compatible configurations in a bundle.

5.34.  RFC7006: Miscellaneous Capabilities Negotiation SDP

   [RFC7006] extends the SDP capability negotiation framework to allow
   endpoints to negotiate three additional SDP capabilities.  In
   particular, this memo provides a mechanism to negotiate bandwidth
   ("b=" line), connection data ("c=" line), and session or media titles
   ("i=" line for each session or media).

   [RFC4567] defines general extensions for SDP and Real Time Streaming
   Protocol (RTSP) to carry messages, as specified by a key management
   protocol, in order to secure the media.  These extensions are
   presented as a framework, to be used by one or more key management
   protocols.  As such, their use is meaningful only when complemented
   by an appropriate key management protocol.

5.36.  RFC4572: Comedia over TLS in SDP

   [RFC4572] specifies how to establish secure connection-oriented media
   transport sessions over the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol
   using SDP.  It defines a new SDP protocol identifier, 'TCP/TLS'.  It
   also defines the syntax and semantics for an SDP 'fingerprint'
   attribute that identifies the certificate that will be presented for
   the TLS session.  This mechanism allows media transport over TLS
   connections to be established securely, so long as the integrity of
   session descriptions is assured.

   [RFC4570] describes how to adapt SDP to express one or more source
   addresses as a source filter for one or more destination "connection"
   addresses.  It defines the syntax and semantics for an SDP "source-
   filter" attribute that may reference either IPv4 or IPv6 address(es)
   as either an inclusive or exclusive source list for either multicast
   or unicast destinations.  In particular, an inclusive source-filter
   can be used to specify a Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) session.

5.38.  RFC6128: RTCP Port for Multicast Sessions

   SDP has an attribute that allows RTP applications to specify an
   address and a port associated with the RTCP traffic.  In RTP-based
   source-specific multicast (SSM) sessions, the same attribute is used
   to designate the address and the RTCP port of the Feedback Target in
   the SDP description.  However, the RTCP port associated with the SSM
   session itself cannot be specified by the same attribute to avoid
   ambiguity, and thus, is required to be derived from the "m=" line of
   the media description.  Deriving the RTCP port from the "m=" line
   imposes an unnecessary restriction.  [RFC6128] removes this
   restriction by introducing a new SDP attribute.

   nettype value of "IN".  If in future there exists a specification
   that defines procedures to multiplex media streams over nettype
   "PSTN", the multiplexing categories for attributes in this section
   MUST be revisited.

                        RFC6193 Attribute Analysis

   NOTE: With the above SDP constraints, a session multiplexed with
   multiple "m=" lines will use only one IPSec association for all of
   the "m=" lines.

5.46.  RFC2326: Real Time Streaming Protocol

   The Real Time Streaming Protocol, or RTSP, is an application-level
   protocol for control over the delivery of data with real-time
   properties.  RTSP provides an extensible framework to enable
   controlled, on-demand delivery of real-time data, such as audio and
   video.

                        RFC2326 Attribute Analysis

   NOTE: [RFC2326] defines SDP attributes that are applicable in the
   declarative usage of SDP alone.  For purposes of this document, only
   the Offer/Answer usage of SDP is considered as mandated by
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation].

5.47.  RFC6064: SDP and RTSP Extensions for 3GPP

   The Packet-switched Streaming Service (PSS) and the Multimedia
   Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS) defined by 3GPP use SDP and RTSP
   with some extensions.  [RFC6064] provides information about these
   extensions and registers the RTSP and SDP extensions with IANA.

                        RFC6064 Attribute Analysis

   NOTE: [RFC6064] defines SDP attributes that are applicable in the
   declarative usage of SDP alone.  For purposes of this document, only
   the Offer/Answer usage of SDP is considered as mandated by
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation].

5.48.  RFC3108: ATM SDP

   [RFC3108] describes conventions for using SDP described for
   controlling ATM Bearer Connections, and any associated ATM Adaptation
   Layer (AAL).

                        RFC3108 Attribute Analysis

   NOTE: RFC3108 describes conventions for using SDP for characterizing
   ATM bearer connections using an AAL1, AAL2 or AAL5 adaptation layers.
   For AAL1, AAL2 and AAL5, bearer connections can be used to transport
   single media streams.  In addition, for AAL1 and AAL2, multiple media
   streams can be multiplexed into a bearer connection.  For all
   adaptation types (AAL1, AAL2 and AAL5), bearer connections can be
   bundled into a single media group.  In all cases addressed by
   RFC3108, a real-time media stream (voice, video, voiceband data,
   pseudo-wire, and others) or a multiplex of media streams is mapped
   directly into an ATM connection.  RFC3108 does not address cases
   where ATM serves as a low-level transport pipe for IP packets which
   in turn can carry one or more real-time (e.g.  VoIP) media sessions
   with a life-cycle different from that of the underlying ATM
   transport.

6.3.  RFC3890: Bandwidth Modifier for SDP

   [RFC3890] defines SDP Transport Independent Application Specific
   Maximum (TIAS) bandwidth modifier that does not include transport
   overhead; instead an additional packet rate attribute is defined.
   The transport independent bit-rate value together with the maximum
   packet rate can then be used to calculate the real bit-rate over the
   transport actually used.

                          RFC3890 bwtype Analysis

   NOTE: The intention of TIAS is that the media level bit-rate is
   multiplied with the known per-packet overhead for the selected
   transport and the maxprate value to determine the worst case bit-rate
   from the transport to more accurately capture the required usage.
   Summing TIAS values independently across "m=" lines and multiplying
   the computed sum with maxprate and the per-packet overhead would
   inflate the value significantly.  Instead performing multiplication
   and adding the individual values is a more appropriate usage.

   [RFC6285] describes a method using the existing RTP and RTCP
   machinery that reduces the acquisition delay.  In this method, an
   auxiliary unicast RTP session carrying the Reference Information to
   the receiver precedes or accompanies the multicast stream.  This
   unicast RTP flow can be transmitted at a faster than natural bitrate
   to further accelerate the acquisition.  The motivating use case for
   this capability is multicast applications that carry real-time
   compressed audio and video.

   periodic ECN feedback, a new RTCP transport feedback message for
   timely reporting of congestion events, and a STUN extension used in
   the optional initialization method using ICE.

7.5.  RFC6642: Third-Party Loss Report

   In a large RTP session using the RTCP feedback mechanism defined in
   [RFC4585], a feedback target may experience transient overload if
   some event causes a large number of receivers to send feedback at
   once.  This overload is usually avoided by ensuring that feedback
   reports are forwarded to all receivers, allowing them to avoid
   sending duplicate feedback reports.  However, there are cases where
   it is not recommended to forward feedback reports, and this may allow
   feedback implosion.  [RFC6642] memo discusses these cases and defines
   a new RTCP Third-Party Loss Report that can be used to inform
   receivers that the feedback target is aware of some loss event,
   allowing them to suppress feedback.  Associated SDP signaling is also
   defined.

   [RFC5109] describes a payload format for generic Forward Error
   Correction (FEC) for media data encapsulated in RTP.  It is based on
   the exclusive-or (parity) operation.  The payload format allows end
   systems to apply protection using various protection lengths and
   levels, in addition to using various protection group sizes to adapt
   to different media and channel characteristics.  It enables complete
   recovery of the protected packets or partial recovery of the critical
   parts of the payload depending on the packet loss situation.

14.  Multiplexing Considerations for Encapsulating Attributes

   This sections deals with recommendations for defining the
   multiplexing characteristics of the SDP attributes that encapsulate
   other SDP attributes/parameters.  Such attributes as of today, for
   example, are defined in [RFC3407], [RFC5939] and [RFC6871] as part of
   a generic framework for indicating and negotiating transport, media,
   and media format related capabilities in the SDP.

   The behavior of such attributes under multiplexing is in turn defined
   by the multiplexing behavior of the attributes they encapsulate which

   are made known once the Offer/Answer negotiation process is
   completed.

14.1.  RFC3407: cpar Attribute Analysis

   [RFC3407] capability parameter attribute (a=cpar) encapsulates b=
   (bandwidth) or an a= attribute.  For bandwidth attribute
   encapsulation, the category SUM is inherited.  For the case of a=
   attribute, the category corresponding to the SDP attribute being
   encapsulated is inherited.

    v=0
    o=alice 2890844526 2890844527 IN IP4 host.atlanta.example.com
    s=
    c=IN IP4 host.atlanta.example.com
    t=0 0
    m=video 3456 RTP/AVP 100
    a=rtpmap:100 VP8/90000
    a=sqn: 0
    a=cdsc: 1 video RTP/AVP 100
    a=cpar: a=rtcp-mux
    m=video 3456 RTP/AVP 101
    a=rtpmap:101 VP8/90000
    a=fmtp:100 max-fr=15;max-fs=1200
    a=cdsc: 2 video RTP/AVP 101
    a=cpar: a=rtcp-mux

   In the above example,the category IDENTICAL is inherited for the cpar
   encapsulated rtcp-mux attribute.

14.2.  RFC5939 Analysis

   [RFC5939] defines a general SDP capability negotiation framework.  It
   also specifies how to provide transport protocols and SDP attributes
   as capabilities and negotiate them using the framework.

   For this purpose, [RFC5939] defines the following

   o  A set of capabilities for the session and its associated media
      stream components, supported by each side.  The attribute
      ("a=acap") defines how to list an attribute name and its
      associated value (if any) as a capability.  The attribute
      ("a=tcap") defines how to list transport protocols (e.g., "RTP/
      AVP") as capabilities.

   o  A set of potential configurations ("a=pcfg") provided by the
      offerer to indicate which combinations of those capabilities can
      be used for the session and its associated media stream

      components.  Potential configurations are not ready for use until
      fully negotiated.  They provide an alternative that MAY be used,
      subject to SDP capability negotiation procedures.  In particular
      the answerer MAY choose one of the potential configurations for
      use as part of the current Offer/Answer exchange.

   o  An actual configuration ("a=acfg") for the session and its
      associated media stream components.  The actual configuration
      identifies the potential configuration that was negotiated for
      use.  Use of an actual configuration does not require any further
      negotiation.

   o  A negotiation process that takes the current actual and the set of
      potential configurations (combinations of capabilities) as input
      and provides the negotiated actual configurations as output.  In
      [RFC5939] the negotiation process is done independently for each
      media description.

14.2.1.  Recommendation: Procedures for Potential Configuration Pairing

   This section provides recommendations for entities generating and
   processing SDP under the generic capability negotiation framework as
   defined in [RFC5939] under the context of media stream multiplexing.

   These recommendations are provided for the purposes of enabling the
   Offerer to make sure that the generated potential configurations
   between the multiplexed streams can (easily) be negotiated to be
   consistent between those streams.  In particular, the procedures aim
   to simplify Answerer's procedure to choose potential configurations
   that are consistent across all the multiplexed media descriptions.

   A potential configuration selects a set of attributes and parameters
   that become part of the media description when negotiated.  When
   multiplexing media descriptions with potential configurations
   specified, there MAY be a need for coordinating this selection
   between multiplexed media descriptions to ensure the right
   multiplexing behavior.

   Although it is possible to analyze the various potential
   configurations in multiplexed media descriptions to find combinations
   that satisfy such constraints, it can quickly become complicated to
   do so.

   The procedures defined in [RFC5939] state that each potential
   configuration in the SDP has a unique configuration number, however
   the scope of uniqueness is limited to each media description.  To
   make it simple for the answerer to chose valid combinations of
   potential configurations across media descriptions in a given bundle

   group, we provide a simple rule for constructing potential
   configurations

   o  Let m-bundle be the set of media descriptions that form a given
      bundle .

   o  Let m-bundle-pcfg be the set of media descriptions in m-bundle
      that include one or more potential configurations.

   o  Each media description in m-bundle-pcfg MUST have at least one
      potential configuration with the same configuration number (e.g.
      "1").

   o  For each potential configuration with configuration number x in m-
      bundle-pcfg, the offerer MUST ensure that if the answerer chooses
      configuration number x in each of the media descriptions in m-
      bundle-pcfg, then the resulting SDP will have all multiplexing
      constraints satisfied for those media descriptions.

   o  Since it is nearly impossible to define a generic mechanism for
      various capability extensions, this document does't provide
      procedures for dealing with the capability extension attributes.
      However, Section 14.3 provide analysis of media capability
      extension attributes as defined in [RFC6871].

   The above allows the answerer to easily find multiplexing compatible
   combinations of potential configurations: The answerer simply choses
   a potential configuration (number) that is present in all of the
   media descriptions with potential configurations in the bundle.

   Note that it is still possible for the offerer to provide additional
   potential configurations with independent configuration numbers.  The
   answerer will have to perform more complicated analysis to determine
   valid multiplexed combinations of those.

14.3.  RFC6871 Analysis

   [RFC6871] extends capability negotiation framework described in
   [RFC5939] by defining media capabilities that can be used to indicate
   and negotiate media types and their associated format parameters.  It
   also allows indication of latent configurations and session
   capabilities.

14.3.1.  Recommendation: Dealing with Payload Type Numbers

   [RFC6871] defines a new payload type ("pt") parameter to be used with
   the potential, actual, and latent configuration parameters.  The
   parameter associates RTP payload type numbers with the referenced
   RTP-based media format capabilities ("a=rmcap") defined in [RFC6871]
   and is appropriate only when the transport protocol uses RTP.  This
   means that the same payload type number can be assigned as part of
   potential or actual configurations in different media descriptions in
   a bundle.  There are rules for the usage of identical Payload Type
   values across multiplexed "m=" lines as described in
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation], which MUST be followed here
   as well.  As described in Section 14.2.1, the use of identical
   configuration numbers for compatible configurations in different
   media descriptions that are part of the bundle provides a way to
   ensure that the answerer can easily pick compatible configurations
   here as well.

14.3.1.1.  Example: Attribute Capability Under Shared Payload Type

   The attributes (a=rmcap, a=mfcap) follow the above recommendations
   under multiplexing.

   a=mfcap:4 mode-change-capability=1
   a=pcfg:1 m=4 pt=4:97
   a=pcfg:4 m=5 pt=5:101


   In the example above, the potential configuration number "1" is
   repeated when referring to media and media format capability used for
   the Payload Type 96.  This implies that both the media capability 2
   and 4 along with their media format capabilities MUST refer to the
   same codec configuration, as per the definition of IDENTICAL-PER-PT.

14.3.2.  Recommendation: Dealing with Latent Configurations

   [RFC6871] adds the notion of a latent configurations, which provides
   configuration information that MAY be used to guide a subsequent
   offer/exchange, e.g. by adding another media stream or use
   alternative codec combinations not currently offered.  Latent
   configurations have configuration numbers which cannot overlap with
   the potential configuration numbers [RFC6871].  Supported
   combinations of potential and latent configurations are indicated by
   use of the "a=sescap" attribute, however use of this attribute is NOT
   RECOMMENDED with multiplexed media, since it requires the use of
   unique configuration numbers across the SDP.  Taken together, this
   means there is no well-defined way to indicate supported combinations

   of latent configurations, or combinations of latent and potential
   configurations with multiplexed media.  It is still allowed to use
   the latent configuration attribute, however the limitations above
   will apply.  To determine valid combinations, actual negotiation will
   have to be attempted subsequently instead.

15.  IANA Considerations

   [RFC EDITOR NOTE: Please replace RFCXXXX with the RFC number of this
   document.]

   The IANA is requested to add a new column named "Mux Category" to
   several of the subregistries in the "Session Description Protocol
   (SDP) Parameters" registry.  Section 15.1 defines a new subregistry
   for identifying the initial registrations for various multiplexing
   categories applicable, as proposed in this document.

   The tables in Section 15.2 identify name of an entry in the existing
   subregistry and specify the value to put in the new "Mux Category"
   column of the associated IANA registry.  Any entries in the existing
   tables that do not have a value for the "Mux Category" specified in
   this RFC will get a value of "TBD".  Future specifications can change
   the "TBD" entries to the correct value.

15.1.  New 'Multiplexing Categories' subregistry

   A new sub-registry needs to be defined called the "Multiplexing
   Categories", with the following registrations created initially:
   "NORMAL", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "IDENTICAL", "TRANSPORT", "SUM",
   "INHERIT", "IDENTICAL-PER-PT", "SPECIAL" and "TBD" as defined in this
   document.

   Initial value registration for "Multiplexing Categories".

   Further entries can be registered on a first-come first-serve basis.
   Each registration needs to indicate the multiplexing category value
   to be added to the "Multiplexing Categories" subregistry as defined
   in this section.

   Such a registration MUST also indicate the applicability of the newly
   defined multiplexing category value to various subregistries defined
   at "Session Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters".

   The general registration procedures of [RFC4566] apply.

15.2.  'Mux Category' column for subregistries

   Each sub-section identifies a subregistry in the "Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) Parameters" registry.  The tables list the column that
   identifies the SDP attribute name/Token/Value from the corresponding
   subregistries and the values to be used for the new "Mux Category"
   column to be added.

15.2.1.  Table: SDP bwtype

   The following values are to be added to the 'SDP bwtype' subregistry
   in the "Session Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters" registry.  The
   references should be updated to point at this RFC as well as the
   previous references.

   The following values are to be added to the "att-field (session
   level)" subregistry in the "Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   Parameters" registry.  The references should be updated to point at
   this RFC as well as the previous references.

16.  Security Considerations

   This document does not add any new security considerations beyond the
   existing considerations in the RFCs for protocols that are being
   multiplexed together.

   The ways that SRTP streams are keyed is not believed to create any
   two-time pad vulnerability for the currently defined SRTP keying
   mechanism.
