     A DTLS Tunnel between Media Distributor and Key Distributor to
                        Facilitate Key Exchange
                    draft-jones-perc-dtls-tunnel-03

Abstract

   This document defines a DTLS tunneling protocol for use in multimedia
   conferences that enables a Media Distributor to facilitate key
   exchange between an endpoint in a conference and the Key Distributor.
   The protocol is designed to ensure that the keying material used for
   hop-by-hop encryption and authentication is accessible to the media
   distributor, while the keying material used for end-to-end encryption
   and authentication is inaccessible to the media distributor.

1.  Introduction

   An objective of the work in the Privacy-Enhanced RTP Conferencing
   (PERC) working group is to ensure that endpoints in a multimedia
   conference have access to the end-to-end (E2E) and hop-by-hop (HBH)
   keying material used to encrypt and authenticate Real-time Transport
   Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550] packets, while the Media Distributor has
   access only to the hop-by-hop (HBH) keying material for encryption
   and authentication.

   This specification defines a tunneling protocol that enables the
   media distributor to tunnel DTLS [RFC6347] messages between an
   endpoint and the key distributor, thus allowing an endpoint to use
   DTLS-SRTP [RFC5764] for establishing encryption and authentication
   keys with the key distributor.

   The tunnel established between the media distributor and key
   distributor is a DTLS association that is established before any
   messages are forwarded by the media distributor on behalf of the
   endpoint.  DTLS packets received from the endpoint are encapsulated
   by the media distributor inside this tunnel as data to be sent to the

   key distributor.  Likewise, when the media distributor receives data
   from the key distributor over the tunnel, it extracts the DTLS
   message inside and forwards that to the endpoint.  In this way, the
   DTLS association for the DTLS-SRTP procedures is established between
   the endpoint and the key distributor, with the media distributor
   simply forwarding packets between the two entities and having no
   visibility into the confidential information exchanged.

   Following the existing DTLS-SRTP procedures, the endpoint and key
   distributor will arrive at a selected cipher and keying material,
   which are used for HBH encryption and authentication by both the
   endpoint and the media distributor.  However, since the media
   distributor would not have direct access to this information, the key
   distributor explicitly shares the HBH key information with the media
   distributor via the tunneling protocol defined in this document.
   Additionally, the endpoint and key distributor will agree on a cipher
   for E2E encryption and authentication.  The key distributor will
   transmit keying material to the endpoint for E2E operations, but will
   not share that information with the media distributor.

   By establishing this DTLS tunnel between the media distributor and
   key distributor and implementing the protocol defined in this
   document, it is possible for the media distributor to facilitate the
   establishment of a secure DTLS association between an endpoint and
   the key distributor in order for the endpoint to receive E2E and HBH
   keying material.  At the same time, the key distributor can securely
   provide the HBH keying material to the media distributor.

3.  Tunneling Concept

   A DTLS association (tunnel) is established between the media
   distributor and the key distributor.  This tunnel is used to relay
   DTLS messages between the endpoint and key distributor, as depicted
   in Figure 1:

                 Figure 1: DTLS Tunnel to Key Distributor

   The three entities involved in this communication flow are the
   endpoint, the media distributor, and the key distributor.  The
   behavior of each entity is described in Section 5.

   The key distributor is a logical function that might might be co-
   resident with a key management server operated by an enterprise,
   reside in one of the endpoints participating in the conference, or
   elsewhere that is trusted with E2E keying material.  This document
   does not preclude any location, only requiring that the key
   distributor not allow the media distributor to gain access to the E2E
   keying material by following the procedures defined in this document.

4.  Example Message Flows

   This section provides an example message flow to help clarify the
   procedures described later in this document.  It is necessary that
   the key distributor and media distributor establish a mutually
   authenticated DTLS association for the purpose of sending tunneled
   messages, though the complete DTLS handshake for the tunnel is not
   shown in Figure 2 since there is nothing new this document introduces
   with regard to those procedures.

   Once the tunnel is established, it is possible for the media
   distributor to relay the DTLS messages between the endpoint and the
   key distributor.  Figure 2 shows a message flow wherein the endpoint
   uses DTLS-SRTP to establish an association with the key distributor.
   In the process, the media distributor shares its supported SRTP
   protection profile information (see [RFC5764]) and the key
   distributor shares HBH keying material and selected cipher with the
   media distributor.  The message used to tunnel the DTLS messages is
   named "Tunnel" and can include Profiles or Key Info data.

            Figure 2: Sample DTLS-SRTP Exchange via the Tunnel

   Each of these tunneled messages on the right-hand side of Figure 2 is
   a message of type "Tunnel" (see Section 6).  Each message contains
   the following information:

   o  Protocol version
   o  Association ID
   o  DTLS message being tunneled

   All messages sent by the media distributor will contain SRTP
   protection profiles supported by the media distributor at the end of
   the Tunnel message.  The key distributor will select a common profile
   supported by both the endpoint and the media distributor to ensure
   that hop-by-hop operations can be successfully performed.

   Further, the key distributor will provide the SRTP [RFC3711] keying
   material to the media distributor for HBH operations at the time it
   sends a DTLS Finished message to the endpoint via the tunnel.  The
   media distributor would extract this Key Info when received and use
   it for hop-by-hop encryption and authentication.  The delivery of the
   keying information along with the completion of the DTLS handshake
   ensures the delivery of the keying information is fate shared with
   completion of the DTLS handshake.  This guarantees that the media
   distributor will have the HBH keying information before it receives
   any media that is encrypted or authenticated with that key.

5.  Tunneling Procedures

   The following sub-sections explain in detail the expected behavior of
   the endpoint, the media distributor, and the key distributor.

   It is important to note that the tunneling protocol described in this
   document is not an extension to TLS [RFC5246] or DTLS [RFC6347].
   Rather, it is a protocol that transports DTLS messages generated by
   an endpoint or key distributor as data inside of the DTLS association
   established between the media distributor and key distributor.

5.1.  Endpoint Procedures

   The endpoint follows the procedures outlined for DTLS-SRTP [RFC5764]
   in order to establish the cipher and keys used for encryption and
   authentication, with the endpoint acting as the client and the key
   distributor acting as the server.  The endpoint does not need to be
   aware of the fact that DTLS messages it transmits toward the media
   distributor are being tunneled to the key distributor.

5.2.  Tunnel Establishment Procedures

   Either the media distributor or key distributor initiates the
   establishment of a DTLS tunnel.  Which entity acts as the DTLS client
   when establishing the tunnel and what event triggers the
   establishment of the tunnel are outside the scope of this document.
   Further, how the trust relationships are established between the key
   distributor and media distributor are also outside the scope of this
   document.

   A tunnel MUST be a mutually authenticated DTLS association.  It is
   used to relay DTLS messages between any number of endpoints and the
   key distributor.

   The media distributor or key distributor MUST establish a tunnel in
   advance of, or no later than the point, when an endpoint attempts to
   establish a DTLS association with the key distributor.

   A media distributor MAY have more than one tunnel established between
   itself and one or more key distributors.  When multiple tunnels are
   established, which tunnel or tunnels to use to send messages for a
   given conference is outside the scope of this document.

5.3.  Media Distributor Tunneling Procedures

   The media distributor MUST forward all messages received from an
   endpoint for a given DTLS association through the same tunnel if more
   than one tunnel has been established between it and a key



Jones                    Expires January 9, 2017                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft            DTLS Tunnel for PERC                 July 2016


   distributor.  A media distributor is not precluded from establishing
   more than one tunnel to a given key distributor.

      Editor's Note: Do we want to have the above requirement or would
      we prefer to allow the media distributor to send messages over
      more than one tunnel to more than one key distributor?  The latter
      would provide for higher availability, but at the cost of key
      distributor complexity.

   The media distributor MUST assign a unique "association identifier"
   for each endpoint-initiated DTLS association and include it in all
   messages forwarded to the key distributor.  The key distributor will
   subsequently include in this identifier in all messages it sends so
   that the media distributor can map messages received via a tunnel and
   forward those messages to the correct endpoint.  The association
   identifier SHOULD be randomly assigned and values not re-used for a
   period of time sufficient to ensure no late-arriving messages might
   be delivered to the wrong endpoint.  It is RECOMMENDED that the
   association identifier not be re-used for at least 24 hours.

      Editor's Note: do we want to recommend a time and is 24 hours
      sufficient?

   The tunnel protocol enables the key distributor to separately provide
   HBH keying material to the media distributor for each of the
   individual endpoint DTLS associations, though the media distributor
   cannot decrypt messages between the key distributor and endpoints.

   When a DTLS message is received by the media distributor from an
   endpoint, it forwards the UDP payload portion of that message to the
   key distributor encapsulated in a Tunnel + Profiles message (see
   Section 6).  The Tunnel + Profiles message allows the media
   distributor to signal which SRTP protection profiles it supports for
   HBH operations.

   The media distributor MUST support the same list of protection
   profiles for the life of a given endpoint's DTLS association, which
   is represented by the association identifier.

   When a message from the key distributor includes "Key Info," the
   media distributor MUST extract the cipher and keying material
   conveyed in order to subsequently perform HBH encryption and
   authentication operations for RTP and RTCP packets sent between it
   and an endpoint.  Since the HBH keying material will be different for
   each endpoint, the media distributor uses the association identifier
   included by the key distributor to ensure that the HBH keying
   material is used with the correct endpoint.

Internet-Draft            DTLS Tunnel for PERC                 July 2016


   The media distributor MUST forward all messages received from either
   the endpoint or the key distributor to ensure proper communication
   between those two entities.

5.4.  Key Distributor Tunneling Procedures

   When the media distributor relays a DTLS message from an endpoint,
   the media distributor will include an association identifier that is
   unique per endpoint-originated DTLS association.  The association
   identifier remains constant for the life of the DTLS association.
   The key distributor identifies each distinct endpoint-originated DTLS
   association by the association identifier.

   The key distributor MUST encapsulate the DTLS message inside a Tunnel
   message (see Section 6) when sending a message to an endpoint.

   The key distributor MUST use the same association identifier in
   messages sent to an endpoint as was received in messages from that
   endpoint.  This ensures the media distributor can forward the
   messages to the correct endpoint.

   The key distributor extracts tunneled DTLS messages from an endpoint
   and acts on those messages as if that endpoint had established the
   DTLS association directly with the key distributor.  The key
   distributor is acting as the server and the endpoint is acting as the
   client.  The handling of the messages and certificates is exactly the
   same as normal DTLS-SRTP procedures between endpoints.

   The key distributor MUST send a DTLS Finished message to the endpoint
   at the point the DTLS handshake completes using the Tunnel + Key Info
   message.  The Key Info includes the selected cipher (i.e. protection
   profile), MKI [RFC3711] value (if any), SRTP master keys, and SRTP
   master salt values.

   The key distributor MUST select a cipher that is supported by both
   the endpoint and the media distributor to ensure proper HBH
   operations.

6.  Tunneling Protocol

   The tunneling protocol is transmitted over the DTLS association
   established between the media distributor and key distributor as
   application data.  The basic message is referred to as the Tunnel
   message.  The media distributor will append supported SRTP protection
   profiles to all Tunnel messages it sends, forming the Tunnel +
   Profiles message.  The key distributor will append information
   necessary for the media distributor to perform HBH encryption and
   authentication as it transmits the DTLS Finished message to the

   endpoint, forming the Tunnel + Key Info message.  The Tunnel, Tunnel
   + Profiles, and Tunnel + Key Info messages are detailed in the
   following sub-sections.

6.1.  Tunnel Message

   Tunneled DTLS messages are transported via the "Tunnel" message as
   application data between the media distributor and the key
   distributor.  The "Tunnel" Message has the following format:

   introduces the following additional fields.

   Data Type: Indicates the type of data that follows.  The value is
   0x01 for SRTP protection profiles supported by the media distributor.

   Length: This is the length in octets of the protection profiles.
   This length must be greater than or equal to 2.

   Protection Profiles: This is an array of two-octet SRTP protection
   profile values as per [RFC5764], with each value represented in
   network byte order.

6.3.  Tunnel Message + Key Info

   When the key distributor has HBH cipher and key information to share
   with the media distributor, the key distributor will send a Tunnel
   message with the Key Info appended as shown below:

   Beyond the fields included in the Tunnel message, this message
   introduces the following additional fields.

   Data Type: Indicates the type of data that follows.  This value is
   0x02 for key information.

   Protection Profile: This is the SRTP protection profile (see
   [RFC5764]) the media distributor MUST use to encrypt and decrypt
   packets sent and received between itself and the endpoint.

   MKI Length: This is the length in octets of the MKI field.  A value
   of zero indicates that the MKI field is absent.

   CWSMK Length: The length of the "Client Write SRTP Master Key" field.

   Client Write SRTP Master Key: The value of the SRTP master key used
   by the client (endpoint).

   SWSMK Length: The length of the "Server Write SRTP Master Key" field.

   Server Write SRTP Master Key: The value of the SRTP master key used
   by the server (media distributor).

   CWSMS Length: The length of the "Client Write SRTP Master Salt"
   field.

   Client Write SRTP Master Salt: The value of the SRTP master salt used
   by the client (endpoint).

   SWSMS Length: The length of the "Server Write SRTP Master Salt"
   field.

   Server Write SRTP Master Salt: The value of the SRTP master salt used
   by the server (media distributor).

7.  PMTU Considerations

   Tunneling DTLS messages received by an endpoint inside the DTLS
   tunnel between the media distributor and key distributor introduces
   only a small risk of message fragmentation, particularly with the
   initial handshake messages carrying client and server certificates.
   The small risk of fragmentation is considered acceptable given that
   DTLS specifies how to recover from loss of handshake messages.

   The additional overhead required for the tunnel is calculated to be
   approximately 50 octets for messages transmitted from the media
   distributor to the key distributor.  Messages from the key
   distributor would generally have slightly less overhead since they do
   not carry a list of protection profiles.  The one exception is the
   Tunnel + Key Info message, which is slightly larger as it contains
   key and salt information for the media distributor.  While the Tunnel
   + Key Info message is larger than Tunnel + Profiles, the DTLS
   message(s) transmitted in that flight (ChangeCipherSpec and Finished)
   are very small and so the overhead does not impose a risk of
   introducing packet fragmentation.

8.  To-Do List

   Given what is presently defined in this draft, it is not possible for
   the key distributor to determine which conference to which a given
   DTLS-SRTP association belongs, making it impossible for the key
   distributor to ensure it is providing the endpoint with the correct
   conference key.  Observing the client certificate might be

   insufficient if the same client is participating in more than one
   conference in parallel.  The media distributor and key distributor
   may need to coordinate or exchange a "conference identifier" common
   to the endpoints a media distributor is bridging together.
   Alternatively, information the key distributor needs to know about
   conference-to-endpoint correlations might be satisfied by getting
   info directly from the endpoints, or some trusted entity on their
   behalf, via some other means.  Need to revisit this design choice in
   the context of all the alternatives.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document establishes a new registry to contain "data type"
   values used in the DTLS Tunnel protocol.  These data type values are
   a single octet in length.  This document defines the values shown in
   Table 1 below, leaving the balance of possible values reserved for
   future specifications:

            +-----------+------------------------------------+
            | Data Type | Description                        |
            +-----------+------------------------------------+
            |    0x01   | Supported SRTP Protection Profiles |
            |    0x02   | Key Information                    |
            +-----------+------------------------------------+

          Table 1: Data Type Values for the DTLS Tunnel Protocol

   The name for this registry is "Datagram Transport Layer Security
   (DTLS) Tunnel Protocol Data Types for Privacy Enhanced Conferencing."

10.  Security Considerations

   TODO - Much more needed.

   The encapsulated data is protected by the DTLS session from the
   endpoint to key distributor and the media distributor is merely an on
   path entity.  This does not introduce any additional security
   concerns beyond a normal DTLS-SRTP session.

   The HBH keying material is protected by the mutual authenticated DTLS
   session between the media distributor and key distributor.  The key
   distributor MUST ensure that it only forms associations with
   authorized media distributors or it could hand HBH keying information
   to untrusted parties.

   The supported profile information send from the media distributor to
   the key distributor is not particularly sensitive as it only provides
   the crypt algorithms supported by the media distributor but it is

   still protected by the DTLS session from the media distributor to key
   distributor.
