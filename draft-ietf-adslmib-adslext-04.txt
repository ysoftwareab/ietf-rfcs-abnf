   2.  Abstract

   This document defines a standard SNMP MIB for additional functions
   not covered by the ADSL Line MIB [1].

   3.  The SNMP Network Management Framework



Expires September 2000                                          [Page 1]


INTERNET-DRAFT          ADSL Line Extention MIB           March 10, 2000


   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o    An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [11].

   o    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for
        the purpose of management.  The first version of this
        Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and
        described in RFC 1155 [14], RFC 1212 [15] and RFC 1215 [16].
        The second version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 2579
        [1], RFC 1903 [2] and RFC 1904 [17].

   o    Message protocols for transferring management information.
        The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called
        SNMPv1 and described in RFC 1157 [7].  A second version of
        the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [18] and RFC 1906 [19].  The third version of the message
        protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [19], RFC
        2272 [20] and RFC 2274 [21].

   o    Protocol operations for accessing management information.
        The first set of protocol operations and associated PDU
        formats is described in RFC 1157 [7].  A second set of
        protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described
        in RFC 1905 [8].

   o    A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [22]
        and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC
        2275 [23].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This document specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.
   A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (e.g., use of Counter64).  Some machine
   readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual
   descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this
   loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the
   semantics of the MIB.

   5.  Introduction

      The purpose of this memo is to define a supplemental set of
   managed objects that is not covered by ADSL Line MIB as defined in
   [10].  This memo addresses the additional objects defined in ITU
   G.997.1 [8].  These additional objects specifically address the
   management capabilities of ADSL "Lite" as defined by ITU-T G.992.2
   [9].

   6.  Relationship of the ADSL LINE EXTENTION MIB with standard MIBs

   This section outlines the relationship of ADSL Line Extention MIB
   with other MIBs described in RFCs and in their various degrees of
   "standardization". ADSL Line Extention MIB obeys the same
   relationship between ADSL Line MIB to other standard MIBs with one
   exception for the ifOperStatus as defined in RFC 1213 [3].

   6.1 ifOperStatus

   ifOperStatus is set to down(2) when the ADSL line interface is in
   power state L2 which means no power.  ifOperStatus is set to up(1) if
   the ADSL line interface is in power state L0 (power on) or L1
   (reduced power).

   7.  Conventions used in the MIB

   7.1  Structure




Expires September 2000                                          [Page 3]


INTERNET-DRAFT          ADSL Line Extention MIB           March 10, 2000


   The MIB is organized to follow the same structure of the ADSL Line
   MIB [1].

   7.2  Additional Managed Objects

   A few objects are added to cover the ADSL "Lite" management and they
   are:

      - ATU-C Transmission System and Line Mode
      - Power Management
      - Counters for Fast Retrains and Failed Fast Retrains
      - Counters for Severed Error Second-line and Unavailable Second
      - Alternative profile configuration for the Dual line mode
   interface

      Besides the management of ADSL "Lite", another object needs to be
   added to the ADSL Line MIB [10] in order to manage the ADSL line
   profile.  The object is the line mode configuration.

      The MIB definitions are attached. The MIB will be branched from
   the ADSL Line MIB [10].

   7.2.1 ATU-C ADSL Transmission System Parameters and Line Mode

        The adslLineConfigTable needs to be extended to cover the ATU-C
   ADSL Transmission system enabling.  Three objects are defined to
   monitor and configure the transmission mode as well as the actual
   line mode:

        - Capability
        - Configuration
        - Actual Status

        Transmission modes can further determine the line mode of the
   ADSL interface.  For example, if g9921PotsNonOverlapped(2) is the
   actual value of the ADSL interface, the interface is operating in
   Full rate ADSL.  If the interface is set to g9922PotsOverlapped(9),
   the interface is operating in G.lite mode.

        The transmssion mode and the corresponding line mode are defined
   as:

        Transmission mode                 Line Mode
        ----------------------------------------------------------
        Regional Std. (ANSI T1.413)       Full
        Regional Std. (ETSI DTS/TM06006)  Full
        G.992.1 POTS non-overlapped       Full
        G.992.1 POTS overlapped           Full

INTERNET-DRAFT          ADSL Line Extention MIB           March 10, 2000


        G.992.1 ISDN non-overlapped       Full
        G.992.1 ISDN overlapped           Full
        G.992.1 TCM-ISDN non-overlapped   Full
        G.992.1 TCM-ISDN overlapped       Full
        G.992.2 POTS non-overlapped       Lite
        G.992.2 POTS overlapped           Lite
        G.992.2 with TCM-ISDN non-overlapped  Lite
        G.992.2 with TCM-ISDN overlapped      Lite

                     Table 1: Transmission Mode and Line Mode

        In case more than one bit is configured for an ADSL interface
   and both Full and Lite modes are selected, the interface is said to
   configure in the dual mode.  Only one bit can be set in the Actual
   object that reflects the actual mode of transmission as well as the
   line mode.

   7.2.2 Power Management

        There are three power states for each managed ADSL interface
   operating in the G.lite mode.  L0 is power on, L1 is power on but
   reduced and L2 is power off.  Power state cannot be configured by an
   operator but it can be viewed via the ifOperStatus object for the
   managed ADSL interface.  The value of the object ifOperStatus is set
   to down(2) if the ADSL interface is in power state L2 and is set to
   up(1) if the ADSL line interface is in power state L0 or L1.

        An ADSL line power state, if is operating in the G.lite mode,
   can also be monitored by the adslLineGlitePowerState object defined
   in the ADSL Line Extention table.  The value of the object enumerates
   the three power states the managed interface can be in.

   7.2.3 Fast Retrain Parameters

        Section 7.4.15 of ITU G.997.1 specifies fast retrain parameters.
   Fast retrain parameters include two counters: fast retrain count and
   failed fast retrain count.  These two counters need to be added to
   all performance tables.

   7.2.4 Counters for Severed Error Second-line and Unavailable Second

        Section 7.2.1.1.7 and section 7.2.1.1.9 specify two counters
   that are not covered by the ADSL Line MIB [10].  These two counters
   (severed error second-line and unavailable second) are added to all
   the performance tables.

        Unavailable second counts number of seconds when there was
   Unavailable Errored seconds during the measured period.  This counter

INTERNET-DRAFT          ADSL Line Extention MIB           March 10, 2000


   does not include the seconds incurred by Fast Retrain and Failed Fast
   Retrain.  Fast Retrain and Failed Fast Retrain are considered to be
   part of normal network operation and thus are not counted as
   unavailable errors.

   7.2.5 Alternative profile configuration for the Dual line mode
   interface

        This object is used only when the interface (for the ADSL line
   or channel) is configured as dual mode, that is, the object
   adslLineTransAtucModeConfig is configued with one or more Full-Rate
   modes and one or more Lite modes.

        The object adslLineConfProfile defined in ADSL-MIB [10] is used
   as the primary Rull-Rate profile.  The newly added object in this MIB
   module, adslLineConfProfileDualLite is used to describe or configure
   the Lite profile.  Note that if one or more Full-Rate modes are
   configured, only one Full-Rate profile is needed.  This object is
   only needed when both Full-Rate and Lite profiles are needed.

        If the static profile is used, the profile name is the ifIndex
   ASCII string plus the differentiator string appended to the end of
   the static profile name.  For example, for interface 100, the object
   adslLineConfProfile is set by the agent to be "100Full" and the
   object adslLineConfProfileDualLite is set to be "100Lite".
