1.  Introduction 
    
   Neighbor Discovery (ND) for IP Version 6 and IPv6 Stateless 
   Address Autoconfiguration provide ways to configure either fixed 
   or mobile nodes with one or more IPv6 addresses, default routes 
   and some other parameters [4][5].  To support the access to 
   additional services in the Internet that are identified by a DNS 
   name, such as a web server, the configuration of at least one 
   recursive DNS server is also needed for DNS name resolution.  
   Because IPv6 address is too long to remember, some ways to 
   configure IPv6 recursive DNS servers are required for the sake of 
   user's convenience [9].

Internet-Draft     IPv6 DNS Configuration based on RA    February 2005 
 
 
   This document defines the process of DNS configuration based on IPv6
   Router Advertisement (RA) to find out the addresses of recursive DNS
   servers within the local network. 
    
2.  Terminology 
    
   This document uses the terminology described in [4][5].  In addition,
   three new terms are defined below: 
    
   Recursive DNS Server (RDNSS) 
    
     A Recursive DNS Server is a name server that offers the recursive
     service of DNS name resolution. 
    
   DNS Server Cache 
    
     DNS Server Cache is a data structure for managing DNS Server 
     Information existing in IPv6 protocol stack in addition to 
     Neighbor Cache and Destination Cache for Neighbor Discovery [4]. 
    
   Resolver File 
    
     Resolver File is a configuration file which DNS resolver on the 
     host uses for DNS name resolution, e.g., /etc/resolv.conf in UNIX.
    
3.  Overview 
    
   RA approach for RDNSS is to define a new ND option called RDNSS 
   option that contains a recursive DNS server address.  Existing ND 
   transport mechanisms (i.e., advertisements and solicitations) are 
   used.  This works in the same way that nodes learn about routers 
   and prefixes.  An IPv6 host can configure the IPv6 addresses of 
   one or more RDNSSes via RA message periodically sent by router or 
   solicited by a Router Solicitation (RS). 
    
   This approach needs RDNSS information to be configured in the 
   routers doing the advertisements.  The configuration of RDNSS 
   address can be performed manually by operator or other ways, such 
   as automatic configuration through DHCPv6 client running on the 
   router [6]-[8].  When advertising more than one RDNSS option, an 
   RA message includes as many RDNSS options as RDNSSes.  
    
   Through ND protocol and RDNSS option along with prefix information 
   option, an IPv6 host can perform its network configuration of its 
   IPv6 address and RDNSS simultaneously [4][5].  The RA option for 
   RDNSS can be used on any network that supports the use of ND.

   However, it is worth noting that some link layers (e.g., WLAN) 
   need to acknowledge multicast packets, which may increase the 
   amount of link-layer traffic [9]. 
    
   The RA approach is useful in some mobile environments where the 
   addresses of the RDNSSes are changing because the RA option 
   includes a lifetime field that allows client to use RDNSSes nearer 
   to the client.  This can be configured to a value that will 
   require the client to time out the entry and switch over to 
   another RDNSS address (see Section 6.1 and 6.2). 
    
   The preference value of RDNSS, included in RDNSS option, allows 
   IPv6 hosts to select a primary RDNSS among several RDNSSes; this 
   can be used for load balancing of RDNSSes (see Section 6.1 and 
   6.2). 
    
4.  Neighbor Discovery Extension 
    
   The IPv6 DNS configuration mechanism in this document needs a new ND
   option in Neighbor Discovery, Recursive DNS Server (RDNSS) option. 
    
4.1.  Recursive DNS Server Option 
    
   RDNSS option contains the IPv6 address of the recursive DNS server. 
   When advertising more than one RDNSS option, an RA message includes 
   as many RDNSS options as DNS servers.  Figure 1 shows the format of 
   RDNSS option.

      Pref            The preference of an RDNSS.  A 4-bit unsigned 
                      integer.  A decimal value of 15 indicates the 
                      highest preference.  A value of zero means 
                      unspecified.  The field can be used for load 
                      balancing of DNS queries with multiple RDNSSes 
                      according to local policy.

                      resolution.  Hosts should contact the source 
                      of this information, router, before this time 
                      interval expires.  A value of all one bits 
                      (0xffffffff) represents infinity.  A value of 
                      zero means that the RDNSS must no longer be used.
    
      IPv6 Address of RDNSS 
                      128-bit IPv6 address of the recursive DNS server.
 
5.  Procedure of DNS Configuration 
    
   The processing of RDNSS option is handled like any other ND option 
   and would happen when an RA is received.  No new procedure is needed.
   Figure 2 shows the procedure of DNS configuration for IPv6 host on 
   the basis of IPv6 RA message.

      Figure 2. Procedure of IPv6 Host DNS Configuration 
    
   The procedure consists of the following steps: 
     
   Step (a) : IPv6 Host sends RS (Router Solicitation) message to get an
              RA message.  It is optional.

Internet-Draft     IPv6 DNS Configuration based on RA    February 2005 
 
 
   Step (b) : For the RS message sent by IPv6 Host, Router sends an RA 
              message, which contains Prefix Information option for 
              stateless address autoconfiguration and RDNSS options 
              for DNS servers. 
    
   Step (c) : If there are not any Prefix Information option and RDNSS 
              in RA message, IPv6 Host goes to Step (f). 
    
   Step (d) : If there is Prefix Information option in RA message, IPv6
              Host performs stateless address autoconfiguration on the 
              basis of the prefix included in the option.  If the 
              stateless autoconfiguration fails, IPv6 Host goes to Step 
              (f). 
    
   Step (e) : If there is an RDNSS option in RA message, IPv6 Host 
              stores the RDNSS address in both its DNS Server Cache and
              resolver configuration file. 
    
   Step (f) : If M (Managed address configuration) flag is set on, IPv6
              Host MUST perform stateful address autoconfiguration 
              through DHCPv6 [4]-[6].  If no RDNSS option is included in
              the RA message, IPv6 Host MAY perform DNS configuration 
              through DHCPv6 [6]-[8] regardless of whether the O flag is
              set or not. 
    
6.  Configuration of DNS Information 
    
   The RDNSS addresses are announced by RDNSS options in RA message.  
   The newly discovered RDNSS addresses are stored and managed in both 
   DNS Server Cache and Resolver File. 
    
6.1.  DNS Server Cache Management 
    
   The DNS configuration in this document needs a new DNS Server Cache 
   in IPv6 protocol stack in addition to Neighbor Cache and Destination
   Cache for Neighbor Discovery [4].  Each entry of DNS Server Cache 
   consists of RDNSS address, Preference, Expire-time, and Onsite-flag 
   as follows: 
    
   - RDNSS address: 
     RDNSS address indicates the recursive DNS server in the site. 
    
   - Preference: 
     Preference, delivered in RDNSS option, is used for an IPv6 host to
     decide which RDNSS it will use as a primary RDNSS among the 
     announced RDNSSes.  This field can be used for load balancing of 
     DNS queries with multiple RDNSSes within an autonomous site.

Internet-Draft     IPv6 DNS Configuration based on RA    February 2005 
 
 
   - Expire-time: 
     Lifetime, delivered in RDNSS option, is used to give the time when
     this entry becomes invalid.  Expire-time is set to the value of 
     Lifetime field of RDNSS option plus the current system time.  
     Whenever a new RDNSS option with the same address is received, 
     this field is updated to have a new expiration time. 
    
   - Onsite-flag: 
     Onsite-flag is set on while Expire-time is less than the current 
     system time; in other words, while this entry is valid.  When 
     Expire-time becomes greater than the current system time, this 
     flag is set off.  When Expire-time becomes less than the current 
     system time again through the receipt of another RDNSS option, the
     flag is set on.  The entry of which Onsite-flag is off is not 
     deleted immediately, but used for DNS resolution in the site where
     the IPv6 host is a mobile node and no RDNSS is provided.  
     Therefore, the IPv6 host MAY use the RDNSS of the previous site 
     even though the RDNSS is in the remote network. 
     To limit the storage needed for the DNS Server Cache, a node MAY 
     need to garbage-collect old entries.  However, care must be taken 
     to insure that sufficient space is always present to hold the 
     working set of active entries.  Any LRU-based policy that only 
     reclaims entries that have expired should be adequate for garbage-
     collecting unused entries [4].  For example, when the replacement 
     is necessary, the IPv6 host can choose one of which Onsite-flag is
     off and of which Expire-time is the least. 
    
6.2.  Synchronization between DNS Server Cache and Resolver File 
    
   When an IPv6 host receives the information of multiple RDNSSes within
   a site through an RA message with RDNSS options, it stores the RDNSS
   addresses in order into both DNS Server Cache and Resolver File.  The
   processing of the RDNSS option included in RA message is as follows:
    
   Step (a) : Receive and parse RDNSS options. 
    
   Step (b) : Arrange the addresses of RDNSSes in a descending order, 
              starting with the biggest value of "Pref" field of the 
              RDNSS option and store them in both DNS Server Cache 
              and Resolver File.  In the case where there are several 
              routers advertising RDNSS option(s) in a subnet, "Pref" 
              field is used to arrange the information. 
    
   Step (c) : For each RDNSS option, check the following: If each value
              of "Pref" and "Lifetime" fields is set to zero, delete the
              corresponding RDNSS entry from both DNS Server Cache and 
              Resolver File in order to let the RDNSS be not used any 
              more for certain reason in network management, e.g., the

Internet-Draft     IPv6 DNS Configuration based on RA    February 2005 
 
 
              breakdown of the RDNSS and a renumbering situation. 
    
   Step (d) : Delete each entry of which Onsite-flag is set off from DNS
              Server Cache and the RDNSS address corresponding to the 
              entry from Resolver File.  However, in mobile environment,
              in order that a mobile node can still use the RDNSS of the
              previous site when the node moves into another site and no
              RDNSS is available there, it MAY be allowed to maintain 
              the entry of which Onsite-flag is off in both DNS Server 
              Cache and Resolver File.  In this case, invalid entries 
              can be deleted according to LRU-based policy. 
              
  As a last resort of DNS name resolution, an IPv6 host can use the 
  RDNSSes manually configured by its user in its Resolver File either 
  when it cannot get the information of RDNSSes from local network or 
  when there is no valid RDNSS address in DNS Server Cache. 
    
6.3.  DNS Resolution 
    
   Whenever DNS resolver has to resolve a DNS name which is not cached 
   in its local DNS cache, it can use one of the RDNSSes listed in 
   Resolver File, which is synchronized with DNS Server Cache.  It 
   refers to RDNSS in order from the first RDNSS among the RDNSSes in 
   Resolver File. 
    
6.4.  Implementation Considerations 
    
   The current ND framework should be modified due to the 
   synchronization between DNS Server Cache for RDNSSes in kernel 
   space and Resolver File in user space.  Because it is unacceptable 
   to write and rewrite the Resolver file (e.g., resolv.conf) from 
   the kernel, another approach is needed.  One simple approach to 
   solve this is to have a daemon around (or a program that is called 
   at the defined intervals) that keeps monitoring the lifetime of 
   RDNSSes all the time.  However, such a daemon is not necessary 
   with the current ND framework. 
    
7.  Applicability Statements 
 
   RA-based DNS configuration is useful in the networks where IPv6 
   address is autoconfigured through IPv6 stateless address 
   autoconfiguration, such as SOHO, home networks, celluar networks 
   (e.g., 3GPP), MIPv6 (especially, HMIPv6), NEMO and MANET connected to
   the Internet.  Especially, the RA approach is useful in some mobile 
   environments where the addresses of the RDNSSes are changing because
   the RA option includes a lifetime field that allows client to use 
   RDNSSes nearer to the client.  This can be configured to a value that

   will require the client to time out the entry and switch over to 
   another RDNSS in current local network. 
    
8.  Open Issues 
    
   There might be some issues regarding RA-based DNS configuration as 
   follows: 
    
   o Can the RA approach be used safely in WLAN networks?  Because 
   multicast is unreliable in WLAN networks, some RA messages advertised
   by a router can be lost [9]. 
    
   o How can we optimize bandwidth on the link, especially the link of 
   cellular networks, such as 3GPP network? 
    
   o Is the use of "Pref" or "Lifetime" fields useful? 
    
   o Is it useful to advertise the well-known anycast addresses for 
   RDNSSes through RA message?  The well-known anycast addresses can be
   set in RA configuration and be announced to IPv6 hosts through RDNSS
   options in order to reduce the configuration effort of users [10]. 
    
   o How to implement RA-based DNS configuration? 
    
9.  Security Considerations 
    
   The security of RA option for RDNSS is the same as ND protocol 
   security [4].  The RA option does not add any new vulnerability. 
    
   It should be noted that the vulnerability of ND is not worse and is a
   subset of the attacks that any node attached to a LAN can do 
   independently of ND.  A malicious node on a LAN can promiscuously 
   receive packets for any router's MAC address and send packets with 
   the router's MAC address as the source MAC address in the L2 header. 
   In the result, the L2 switches send packets addressed to the router 
   to the malicious node.  Also, this attack can send redirects that 
   tell the hosts to send their traffic somewhere else.  The malicious 
   node can send unsolicited RA or NA replies, answer RS or NS requests,
   etc.  All of this can be done independently of implementing ND.  
   Therefore, the RA option for RDNSS does not add to the vulnerability.
    
   Security issues regarding the ND protocol have been discussed at IETF
   SEND (Securing Neighbor Discovery) Working Group [11].
