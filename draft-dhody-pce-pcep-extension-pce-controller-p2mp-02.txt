   PCEP Procedures and Protocol Extensions for Using PCE as a Central
                    Controller (PCECC) for P2MP LSPs
         draft-dhody-pce-pcep-extension-pce-controller-p2mp-02

Abstract

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of Software-
   Defined Networking (SDN) systems.  It can compute optimal paths for
   traffic across a network and can also update the paths to reflect
   changes in the network or traffic demands.

   The PCE has been identified as an appropriate technology for the
   determination of the paths of point- to-multipoint (P2MP) TE Label
   Switched Paths (LSPs).

   PCE was developed to derive paths for MPLS P2MP LSPs, which are
   supplied to the head end (root) of the LSP using PCEP.  PCEP has been
   proposed as a control protocol to allow the PCE to be fully enabled
   as a central controller.

   A PCE-based central controller (PCECC) can simplify the processing of
   a distributed control plane by blending it with elements of SDN and
   without necessarily completely replacing it.  Thus, the P2MP LSP can
   be calculated/setup/initiated and the label forwarding entries can
   also be downloaded through a centralized PCE server to each network
   devices along the P2MP path while leveraging the existing PCE
   technologies as much as possible.

   This document specifies the procedures and PCEP protocol extensions
   for using the PCE as the central controller for P2MP TE LSP.

1.  Introduction

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) [RFC4655] was developed to offload
   path computation function from routers in an MPLS traffic-engineered
   network.  Since then, the role and function of the PCE has grown to
   cover a number of other uses (such as GMPLS [RFC7025]) and to allow
   delegated control [RFC8231] and PCE-initiated use of network
   resources [RFC8281].

   According to [RFC7399], Software-Defined Networking (SDN) refers to a
   separation between the control elements and the forwarding components
   so that software running in a centralized system, called a
   controller, can act to program the devices in the network to behave
   in specific ways.  A required element in an SDN architecture is a
   component that plans how the network resources will be used and how
   the devices will be programmed.  It is possible to view this
   component as performing specific computations to place traffic flows
   within the network given knowledge of the availability of network
   resources, how other forwarding devices are programmed, and the way
   that other flows are routed.  This is the function and purpose of a
   PCE, and the way that a PCE integrates into a wider network control
   system (including an SDN system) is presented in [RFC7491].

   In early PCE implementations, where the PCE was used to derive paths
   for MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs), paths were requested by network
   elements (known as Path Computation Clients (PCCs)), and the results
   of the path computations were supplied to network elements using the
   Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) [RFC5440].
   This protocol was later extended to allow a PCE to send unsolicited
   requests to the network for LSP establishment [RFC8281].

   [RFC8283] introduces the architecture for PCE as a central controller
   as an extension of the architecture described in [RFC4655] and
   assumes the continued use of PCEP as the protocol used between PCE
   and PCC.  [RFC8283] further examines the motivations and
   applicability for PCEP as a Southbound Interface (SBI), and
   introduces the implications for the protocol.

   A PCE-based central controller (PCECC) can simplify the processing of
   a distributed control plane by blending it with elements of SDN and
   without necessarily completely replacing it.  Thus, the LSP can be
   calculated/setup/initiated and the label forwarding entries can also
   be downloaded through a centralized PCE server to each network
   devices along the path while leveraging the existing PCE technologies
   as much as possible.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] specify the
   procedures and PCEP protocol extensions for using the PCE as the
   central controller for static P2P LSPs, where LSPs can be provisioned
   as explicit label instructions at each hop on the end-to-end path.
   Each router along the path must be told what label-forwarding
   instructions to program and what resources to reserve.  The PCE-based
   controller keeps a view of the network and determines the paths of
   the end-to-end LSPs, and the controller uses PCEP to communicate with
   each router along the path of the end-to-end LSP.

   [RFC4857] describes how to set up point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Traffic
   Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) for use in Multiprotocol
   Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.  The
   PCE has been identified as a suitable application for the computation
   of paths for P2MP TE LSPs ([RFC5671]).  The extensions of PCEP to
   request path computation for P2MP TE LSPs are described in [RFC8306].
   Further [RFC8623] specify the extensions that are necessary in order
   for the deployment of stateful PCEs to support P2MP TE LSPs as well
   as the setup, maintenance and teardown of PCE-initiated P2MP LSPs
   under the stateful PCE model.

   This document extends
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] to specify the
   procedures and PCEP protocol extensions for using the PCE as the
   central controller for static P2MP LSPs, where LSPs can be
   provisioned as explicit label instructions at each hop on the end-to-
   end path with an added functionality of a P2MP branch node.  As per
   [RFC4875], a branch node is an LSR that replicates the incoming data
   on to one or more outgoing interfaces.
   [I-D.ietf-teas-pcecc-use-cases] describes the use cases for P2MP in
   PCECC architecture.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Terminology

   Terminologies used in this document is same as described in the draft
   [RFC8283] and [I-D.ietf-teas-pcecc-use-cases].

3.  Basic PCECC Mode

   As described in [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller], in
   this mode LSPs are provisioned as explicit label instructions at each
   hop on the end-to-end path.  Each router along the path must be told
   what label forwarding instructions to program and what resources to
   reserve.  The controller uses PCEP to communicate with each router
   along the path of the end-to-end LSP.  Note that the PCE-based
   controller will take responsibility for managing some part of the
   MPLS label space for each of the routers that it controls, and may
   taker wider responsibility for partitioning the label space for each
   router and allocating different parts for different uses.  This is
   also described in section 3.1.2. of [RFC8283].  For the purpose of
   this document, it is assumed that label range to be used by a PCE is
   known and set on both PCEP peers.  A future extension could add this
   capability to advertise the range via possible PCEP extensions as
   well.

   This document extends the functionality to include support for
   central control instruction for replication at the branch nodes.

   The rest of processing is similar to the existing stateful PCE
   mechanism for P2MP.

4.  Procedures for Using the PCE as the Central Controller (PCECC) for
    P2MP

4.1.  Stateful PCE Model

   Active stateful PCE is described in [RFC8231] and extended for P2MP
   [RFC8623].  PCE as a central controller (PCECC) reuses existing
   Active stateful PCE mechanism as much as possible to control the LSP.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] extends PCEP
   messages - PCRpt, PCInitiate, PCUpd message for the Central

   Controller's Instructions (CCI) (label forwarding instructions in the
   context of this document).  This documents specify the procedure for
   additional instruction for branch node needed for P2MP.

4.2.  PCECC Capability Advertisement

   As per [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller], during PCEP
   Initialization Phase, PCEP Speakers (PCE or PCC) advertise their
   support of PCECC extensions by sending a PATH-SETUP-TYPE-CAPABILITY
   TLV in the OPEN object with this PST=PCECC included in the PST list.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] also defines the
   PCECC Capability sub-TLV.  A new M-bit is added in PCECC-CAPABILITY
   TLV to indicate support for PCECC-P2MP.  A PCC MUST set M-bit in
   PCECC-CAPABILITY TLV and include STATEFUL-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV with
   P2MP bits set ([RFC8623]) in OPEN Object to support the PCECC P2MP
   extensions defined in this document.  If M-bit is set in PCECC-
   CAPABILITY TLV and N-bit in STATEFUL-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV is not set in
   OPEN Object, PCE SHOULD send a PCErr message with Error-Type=19
   (Invalid Operation) and Error-value=TBD (P2MP capability was not
   advertised) and terminate the session.

4.3.  LSP Operations

   The PCEP messages pertaining to PCECC MUST include PATH-SETUP-TYPE
   TLV [RFC8408] with PST=PCECC
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] in the SRP object to
   clearly identify the PCECC LSP is intended.

4.3.1.  Basic PCECC LSP Setup

   In order to setup a P2MP LSP based on PCECC mechanism, a PCC MUST
   delegate the P2MP LSP by sending a PCRpt message with PST set for
   PCECC and D (Delegate) flag (see [RFC8623]) set in the LSP object.

   P2MP-LSP-IDENTIFIER TLV [RFC8623] MUST be included for PCECC LSP, the
   tuple uniquely identifies the P2MP LSP in the network.  As per
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller], the LSP object is
   included in central controller's instructions (label download) to
   identify the PCECC LSP for this instruction.

   When a PCE receives PCRpt message with D flags and PST Type set, it
   calculates the P2MP tree and assigns labels along the path; and set
   up the path by sending PCInitiate message to each node along the path
   of the LSP, similar to
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller].  The new extension
   required is the instructions on the branch nodes for replications to
   more than one outgoing interfaces with respective labels.  The rest

Internet-Draft                    PCECC                      August 2019


   of the operations remains same as
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] and [RFC8623].

4.3.2.  Central Control Instructions

   The new central controller's instructions (CCI) for the label
   operations in PCEP is done via the PCInitiate message, by defining a
   new PCEP Objects for CCI operations.  Local label range of each PCC
   is assumed to be known at both the PCC and the PCE.

4.3.2.1.  Label Download

   In order to setup an LSP based on PCECC, the PCE sends a PCInitiate
   message to each node along the path to download the Label instruction
   as described in Section 4.3.1.

   The CCI object MUST be included, along with the LSP object in the
   PCInitiate message.  The LSP-IDENTIFIER TLV MUST be included in LSP
   object.  The SPEAKER-ENTITY-ID TLV SHOULD be included in LSP object.

   As described in [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller], if
   a node (PCC) receives a PCInitiate message which includes a Label to
   download as part of CCI, that is out of the range set aside for the
   PCE, it send a PCErr message with Error-type=TBD (PCECC failure) and
   Error-value=TBD (Label out of range).  If a PCC receives a PCInitiate
   message but failed to download the Label entry, it sends a PCErr
   message with Error-type=TBD (PCECC failure) and Error-value=TBD
   (instruction failed).

   Consider the example in the [I-D.ietf-teas-pcecc-use-cases] -

   PCECC would provision each node along the path and assign incoming
   and outgoing labels from R1 to {R6, R8} with the path: {R1, 6000},
   {6000, R2, {9001,9002}}, {9001, R4, 9003}, {9002, R5, 9004} {9003,
   R3, 9005}, {9004, R6}, {9005, R8}. The operations on all nodes except
   R2 are same as [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller].  The
   branch node (R2) needs to be instructed to replicate two copies of
   the incoming packet, and sent towards R4 and R5 with 9001 and 9002
   labels respectively).  This done via including 3 instances of CCI
   objects in the PCEP messages, one for each label in the example, 6000
   for incoming and 9001/9002 for outgoing (along with remote nexthop).
   The message and procedure remains exactly as
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] with only
   distinction that more than one outgoing CCI MAY be present for the
   P2MP LSP.

4.3.2.2.  Label Cleanup

   In order to delete an P2MP LSP based on PCECC, the PCE sends a
   central controller instructions via a PCInitiate message to each node
   along the path of the LSP to cleanup the Label forwarding instruction
   as per [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller].  In case of
   branch nodes all instances of CCIs needs to be present in the PCEP
   message.

4.3.3.  PCE Initiated PCECC LSP

   The LSP Instantiation operation is same as defined in [RFC8281] and
   [RFC8623].

   In order to setup a P2MP PCE Initiated LSP based on the PCECC
   mechanism, a PCE sends PCInitiate message with Path Setup Type set
   for PCECC (see Section 5.2) to the Ingress PCC (root).

   The Ingress PCC MUST also set D (Delegate) flag (see [RFC8231]) and C
   (Create) flag (see [RFC8281]) in LSP object of PCRpt message.  The
   PCC responds with first PCRpt message with the status as "GOING-UP"
   and assigned PLSP-ID.

   As described in [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller], the
   label forwarding instructions from PCECC are send after the initial
   PCInitiate and PCRpt exchange.  This is done so that the PLSP-ID and
   other LSP identifiers can be obtained from the ingress and can be
   included in the label forwarding instruction in the next PCInitiate
   message.  The rest of the PCECC LSP setup operations are same as
   those described in Section 4.3.1.

4.3.4.  PCECC LSP Update

   In case of a modification of PCECC P2MP LSP with a new path, the
   procedure and instructions as described in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] apply.

4.3.5.  Re Delegation and Cleanup

   In case of a redelgation and cleanup of PCECC P2MP LSP, the procedure
   and instructions as described in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] apply.

4.3.6.  Synchronization of Central Controllers Instructions

   The procedure and instructions are as per
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller].

4.3.7.  PCECC LSP State Report

   An Ingress PCC MAY choose to apply any OAM mechanism to check the
   status of LSP in the Data plane and MAY further send its status in
   PCRpt message (as per [RFC8623]) to the PCE.

5.  PCEP Objects

5.1.  OPEN Object

5.1.1.  PCECC Capability sub-TLV

   The PCECC-CAPABILITY sub-TLV is an optional TLV for use in the OPEN
   Object for PCECC capability advertisement in PATH-SETUP-TYPE-
   CAPABILITY TLV as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller].

   This document adds a new flag (M-bit) in PCECC-CAPABILITY sub-TLV to
   indicate the support for P2MP in PCECC.  A PCC MUST set M-bit in
   PCECC-CAPABILITY sub-TLV and set the N (P2MP-CAPABILITY), M (P2MP-
   LSP-UPDATE-CAPABILITY), and P (P2MP-LSP-INSTANTIATION-CAPABILITY) (as
   per [RFC8623]) in STATEFUL-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV [RFC8231] to support
   the PCECC P2MP extensions defined in this document.  If M-bit is set
   in PCECC-CAPABILITY sub-TLV and the P2MP bits in STATEFUL-PCE-
   CAPABILITY TLV are not set in OPEN Object, PCE SHOULD send a PCErr
   message with Error-Type=19 (Invalid Operation) and Error-
   value=TBD(P2MP capability was not advertised) and terminate the
   session.

5.2.  PATH-SETUP-TYPE TLV

   The PATH-SETUP-TYPE TLV is defined in [RFC8408];
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] defines a PST value
   for PCECC, which is also used for P2MP.

5.3.  CCI Object

   The Central Control Instructions (CCI) Object
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] is used by the PCE
   to specify the forwarding instructions (Label information in the
   context of this document) to the PCC, and MAY be carried within
   PCInitiate or PCRpt message for label download which defined Object
   Type 1 for MPLS Label, which is also used for P2MP.  The address TLVs
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] associates the next-
   hop information in case of an outgoing label.

   If a node (PCC) receives a PCInitiate/PCUpd message with more than
   one CCI with O-bit set for outgoiing label and the node does not
   support the P2MP branch/replication capability, it MUST respond with
   PCErr message with Error-Type=2(Capability not supported).

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations described in [RFC8231], [RFC8281],
   [RFC8623], and [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] apply
   to the extensions described in this document.

7.  Manageability Considerations

7.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   A PCE or PCC implementation SHOULD allow to configure to enable/
   disable PCECC P2MP capability as a global configuration.

7.2.  Information and Data Models

   [RFC7420] describes the PCEP MIB, this MIB can be extended to get the
   PCECC capability status.

   The PCEP YANG module [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-yang] could be extended to
   enable/disable PCECC P2MP capability.

7.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new liveness
   detection and monitoring requirements in addition to those already
   listed in [RFC5440].

7.4.  Verify Correct Operations

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new operation
   verification requirements in addition to those already listed in
   [RFC5440] and [RFC8231].

7.5.  Requirements On Other Protocols

   PCEP extensions defined in this document do not put new requirements
   on other protocols.

7.6.  Impact On Network Operations

   PCEP extensions defined in this document do not put new requirements
   on network operations.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  PCECC-CAPABILITY TLV

   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] defines the PCECC-
   CAPABILITY TLV and requests that IANA creates a registry to manage
   the value of the PCECC-CAPABILITY TLV's Flag field.  IANA is
   requested to allocate a new bit in the PCECC-CAPABILITY TLV Flag
   Field registry, as follows:

          Bit            Description                Reference
          TBD            M((PCECC-P2MP-CAPABILITY)) This document

8.2.  PCEP-Error Object

   IANA is requested to allocate new error types and error values within
   the "PCEP-ERROR Object Error Types and Values" sub-registry of the
   PCEP Numbers registry for the following errors:


   Error-Type   Meaning
   ----------   -------
   19           Invalid operation.

                 Error-value = TBD :                 P2MP capability was
                                                     not advertised
