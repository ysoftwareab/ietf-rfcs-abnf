INTERNET DRAFT           Graceful Restart Survey              March 2004


            Graceful restart functionality is not on by default and one
            has to configure 'graceful-restart' for BGP and other
            protocols to implement this functionality.  So all answers
            below are conditional on this knob being configured.  (There
            is one knob for all protocols.)

         Send the End-of-RIB marker upon completion of initial routing
         update according to section 4?

            Yes.

         Exchange the Graceful Restart capability according to section
         5?

            Yes.

         Restart BGP sessions normally (i.e., a full restart not a
         Graceful Restart) when terminated with a NOTIFICATION message
         according to section 6?

            Yes.

         Function as a Restarting Speaker according to section 6.1?

            Yes, except that we don't have a capability today (needs a
            knob at most) to restrict graceful-restart to planned
            restarts only.  But this is an internal matter which has no
            bearing on interop and I don't see why this paragraph should
            be part of the draft:

               If one wants to apply graceful restart only when the
               restart is planned (as opposed to both planned and
               unplanned restart), then one way to accomplish this would
               be to set the Forwarding State bit to 1 after a planned
               restart, and to 0 in all other cases.  Other approaches
               to accomplish this are outside the scope of this
               document.

         Function as a Receiving Speaker according to section 6.2?

            Yes.

      List other implementations that you have tested for Graceful
      Restart interoperability.

         None.

2.4. Laurel Networks, Inc.

      Person filling out this form: Ardas Cilingiroglu
      <ardas@laurelnetworks.com>

      Does your Graceful Restart implementation do the following as
      defined in draft-ietf-idr-restart-05.txt?

         Send the End-of-RIB marker upon completion of initial routing
         update according to section 4?

            Yes.  End-of-RIB is generated upon completion of the initial
            update messages if graceful-restart is configured, even when
            it's a normal bgp (re)start.

         Exchange the Graceful Restart capability according to section
         5?

            Yes.

         Restart BGP sessions normally (i.e., a full restart not a
         Graceful Restart) when terminated with a NOTIFICATION message
         according to section 6?

            Yes.

         Function as a Restarting Speaker according to section 6.1?

            Yes.  We support both planned and unplanned restarts.  Also,
            implemented a configurable upper bound to defer route
            selection.

         Function as a Receiving Speaker according to section 6.2?

            Yes.  Implemented a configurable upper bound to retain stale
            Rib-In routes.

      Restart interoperability.

      Other information:

         I defined a 'Resync-Time' to cover the following:

            a) Restarter

               This timer is started after establishment, and sets an
               upper limit on time the restarter will wait for EOR
               markers before sending routes.

            b) Helper

               This timer is started at the same point, and is the upper
               limit on the time taken by the restarter to refresh the
               'stale' routes.
