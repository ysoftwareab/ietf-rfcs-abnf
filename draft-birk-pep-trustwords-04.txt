     IANA Registration of Trustword Lists: Guide, Template and IANA
                             Considerations
                      draft-birk-pep-trustwords-04

Abstract

   This document specifies the IANA Registration Guidelines for
   Trustwords, describes corresponding registration procedures, and
   provides a guideline for creating Trustword list specifications.

   Trustwords are common words in a natural language (e.g., English),
   which hexadecimal strings are mapped to.  Such a mapping makes
   verification processes like fingerprint comparisons more practical,
   and less prone to misunderstandings.

1.  Introduction

   In public-key cryptography, comparing the respective public key
   fingerprints for each of the communication partners involved is vital
   to ensure that there is no Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on the
   communication channel.  These fingerprints normally consist of a
   chain of hexadecimal characters, which are often impractical,
   cumbersome, and prone to misunderstandings for end-users.

   To mitigate these challenges, several systems offer Trustword
   comparison as an alternative to these hexadecimal strings.
   Trustwords are common words in a natural language (e.g., English),
   which these hexadecimal strings are mapped to.  Using Trustwords
   makes verification processes like fingerprint comparisons more
   natural for users.

   For example, in pEp's Privacy by Default proposition [I-D.birk-pep]
   Trustwords are used to facilitate easy contact verification for end-
   to-end encryption.  Trustword comparison is offered after the peers
   have opportunistically exchanged public keys.  Examples of Trustword
   lists used by current pEp implementations can be found here in CSV
   format: https://pep.foundation/dev/repos/pEpEngine/file/tip/db.

   In addition to contact verification, Trustwords are also used for
   other purposes, such as Human-Readable 128-bit Keys [RFC1751], One
   Time Passwords (OTP) [RFC1760] [RFC2289], SSH host-key verification,
   VPN server certificate verification, deriving private keys in
   blockchain applications for cryptocurrencies, and to import or
   synchronize secret keys across multiple devices owned by a single
   user [I-D.hoeneisen-pep-keysync].  Further ideas include the use of
   Trustwords for private key recovery in case of loss, contact
   verification in Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)
   [RFC6120], or for X.509 certificate verification in browsers
   [RFC3647].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terms

   The following terms are defined for the scope of this document:

   o  pEp Handshake: The process of one user contacting another over an
      independent channel in order to verify Trustwords (or by fallback:
      fingerprints).  This can be done in-person or through established
      verbal communication channels, like a phone call.
      [I-D.marques-pep-handshake]

   o  Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack: cf. [RFC4949], which states: "A
      form of active wiretapping attack in which the attacker intercepts
      and selectively modifies communicated data to masquerade as one or
      more of the entities involved in a communication association."

2.  The Concept of Trustword Mapping

2.1.  Example

   As already discussed, fingerprints normally consist of a string of
   hexadecimal characters.  A typical fingerprint looks like this:

      F482 E952 2F48 618B 01BC 31DC 5428 D7FA ACDC 3F13

   Instead of the hexadecimal string, Trustwords allow users to compare
   ten common words of a language of their choosing.  For example, the
   above fingerprint, mapped to English Trustwords, might appear as:

      dog house brother town fat bath school banana kite task

   The same fingerprint might appear in German Trustwords as:

      klima gelb lappen weg trinken alles kaputt rasen rucksack durch

   Note: These examples are for illustration purposes only, and are not
   derived from any published Trustword list.

2.2.  Previous work

   The basic concept of Trustword mapping - also known as a biometric
   word list - for fingerprint comparison is well-documented.  Examples
   of this concept are used with One-Time Passwords (OTP) [RFC1751]
   [RFC1760] [RFC2289], as well as the PGP Word List ("Pretty Good
   Privacy word list" [PGP.wl].  Furthermore, cryptocurrencies use a
   similar concept for deriving private keys [bitcoin.wl].

   [[ TODO: Explain each previous usage a bit further and synchronize
   with section Section 1. ]]

   Regarding today's needs, previous proposals have the following
   shortcomings:

   o  Small/limited word lists, which generally result in more words to
      compare

   o  Existing word lists are usually only available in English, which
      limits their usefulness for non-English speakers

   Furthermore, there are differences in the basic concept:

   o  The Trustword concept suggested herein intends to improve
      usability and security for all users, instead of only the
      technically-savvy.



Hoeneisen & Marques      Expires January 9, 2020                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft    IANA Registration of Trustword Lists         July 2019


   o  In many use cases, Trustwords are only read (aloud) during the
      comparison process, rather than being written or typed.  For
      example, two users might compare their respective Trustwords
      during a phone call.  Verbal comparison reduces the need to keep
      the actual Trustwords short.  The use of longer Trustwords
      increases the entropy within the system, as it allows for a larger
      dictionary, and thus reduces the likelihood of phonetic
      collisions.

2.3.  Number of Trustwords for a language

   If the number of Trustwords in a dictionary is low, shorter parts of
   the original string (e.g., fingerprint) can be mapped to a single
   Trustword.  Thus, many Trustwords will need to be compared, which
   results in a potentially cumbersome process for users, and lead to
   reduced usability.

   To reduce the number of Trustwords that need to be compared, pEp's
   Privacy by Default proposition [I-D.birk-pep] calls for 16-bit
   scalars to be mapped to natural language words.  Therefore, the size
   (by number of key-value pairs) of any key-value pair structure is
   65536.  However, the number of unique values to be used in a language
   may be smaller than this number.  This discrepancy can be addressed
   by using the same value, or Trustword, for more than one key.  In
   such cases, the entropy of the representation is slightly reduced.
   For example, a Trustword list of 42000 words still allows for an
   entropy of log_2(42000), which is roughly 15.36 bits in 16-bit
   mappings.  As a consequence such Trustword lists are not bijective.

   On the other hand, small Trustword lists allow for Trustwords
   consisting of words with shorter strings (number of short words per
   natural language is normally limited), which are easier to use in
   implementations where Trustwords have to be typed or written, such as
   in OTP applications.

   Note: This specification allows for registration of variable numbers
   of Trustwords per dictionary.

2.4.  Language

   Although English is used around the world, the vast majority of the
   global population is not English-speaking.  For an application to be
   useful to as wide of a user base as possible, localization is
   essential.  Therefore, this specification allows for registration of
   Trustword lists in different languages.

   In applications where two humans are attempting to establish secure
   communications, it is likely that they share a common language.  At

   this time, no real-world use cases for Trustword list translation
   capability have been identified.  Because the translation process
   inherently - and drastically - increases complexity from an IANA
   registration standpoint, the topic of Trustword translation is beyond
   the scope of this document.

2.5.  The nature of the words

   Every Trustword list SHOULD be clear of offensive language (i.e.,
   swear/curse words, slurs, derogatory language, etc.).  This process
   SHOULD be performed by native speakers of each respective language.

3.  Security Considerations

   There are no specific security considerations.

4.  Privacy Considerations

   [[ TODO ]]

5.  IANA Considerations

   Each natural language requires a different set of Trustwords.  To
   allow implementers for identical Trustword lists, a IANA registry is
   to be established.  The IANA registration policy according to
   [RFC8126] is "Expert Review" and "Specification Required".

   [[ Note: Further details of the IANA registry and requirements for
   the expert to assess the specification are for further study.  A
   similar approach as used in [RFC6117] is likely followed. ]]

5.2.  IANA Registration

   An IANA registration will contain the fallowing elements:

5.2.1.  Language Code (<languagecode>)

   The language code follows the ISO 639-3 specification [ISO639], e.g.,
   eng, deu.

   [[ Note: It is for further study, which of the ISO 639 Specifications
   is most suitable to address the Trustwords' challenge. ]]

   Example usage for German:

   e.g.  <languagecode>deu</languagecode>

5.2.2.  Bit Size (<bitsize>)

   The bit size is the number of bits that can be mapped with the
   Wordlist.  The number of registered words in a word list MUST be 2 ^
   "(<bitsize>)".

   Example usage for 16-bit Wordlist:

   e.g.  <bitsize>16</bitsize>

5.2.3.  Number Of Unique Words (<numberofuniquewords>)

   The number of unique words that are registered.

   e.g.  <numberofuniquewords>65536</numberofuniquewords>

5.2.4.  Bijectivity (<bijective>)

   Whether the registered Wordlist has a one-to-one mapping, meaning the
   number of unique words registered equals 2 ^ "(<bitsize>)".

   Valid content: ( yes | no )

   e.g.  <bijective>yes</bijective>

5.2.5.  Version (<version>)

   The version of the Wordlist MUST be unique within a language code.

   [[ Note: Requirements to a "smart" composition of the version number
   are for further study ]]

   o  Decide which ISO language code either 639-1 or 639-3 to use, i.e.,
      ISO-639-1 (e.g., ca, de, en, ...) as currently used in pEp
      implementations (running code) or ISO-639-3 (eng, deu, ita, ...)

   o  Adjust exact representation of wordlists

      *  e.g.  XML, CSV, ...

      *  Syntax for non-ASCII letters or language symbols (UTF-8) in
         Wordlists

   o  Need for optional entropy value assigned to words, to account for
      similar phonetics among words in the same wordlist?

   o  Need for an additional field, to define what a wordlist is
      optimized for, e.g., "entropy", "minimize word lengths", ...?

   o  Work out (requirements for) "smart" composition of the version
      number

   o  Decide whether in non-bijective Wordlists the redundant words need
      to be repeated in the IANA Registration

   o  Register only a hash over the wordlist with IANA?

   o  Does it make sense to open registrations for other patterns than
      just words, e.g., images?
