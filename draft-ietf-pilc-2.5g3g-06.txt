Internet-Draft    TCP over 2.5G and 3G Wireless Networks   February 2002


1. Introduction

   Much development and deployment activity has centered around 2.5G
   (GPRS, HSCSD and EDGE) and 3G technologies (Wideband CDMA and
   cdma2000).  A primary motivation for these is data communication,
   and, in particular, Internet access. Accordingly, key issues are TCP
   performance and the several techniques which can be applied to
   optimize it over different wireless environments[1]. 

   This document proposes a profile of such techniques, (particularly
   effective for use with 2.5G and 3G wireless networks), derived from
   previous work at the IETF [30]. All the configuration options in
   this document are found in modern TCP stacks and are widely
   available and may be used safely on the general Internet.  Even
   hosts which serve predominantly non-wireless users may safely enable
   these options. 

   Two example applications of the recommendations in this document
   are: 

   The WAP Forum [13] is an industry association that has developed
   standards for wireless information and telephony services on digital
   mobile phones. In order to address WAP functionality for high speed
   networks such as 2.5G and 3G networks, and to aim at convergence
   with Internet standards, the WAP Forum thoroughly revised its
   specifications. The resultant version 2.0[18] adopts TCP as its
   transport protocol, and recommends TCP optimization mechanisms
   closely aligned with those described in this document. 

   I-mode[24], with a huge subscriber base, is a wireless Internet
   service deployed on handsets in Japan.  The new version of i-mode
   that operates over W-CDMA is called FOMA[25]. It deploys the profile
   of TCP described in this document.

2. 2.5G and 3G Link Characteristics

   Link layer characteristics of 2.5G/3G networks have significant
   effects on TCP performance. In this section we presents various
   aspects of link characteristics unique to the 2.5G/3G networks. 

2.1 Data rates

   The main incentive for transition from 2G to 2.5G to 3G is the
   increased voice capacity as well as data rates for the users. 2.5G
   systems have data rates of 10-20 kbps in uplink and 10-40 kbps in
   downlink. 3G systems are expected to have bit rates around 64 kbps
   in uplink and 384 kbps in downlink. Considering the resulting
   bandwidth-delay product of around 1-5KB for 2.5G and 8-50 KB for 3G,
   2.5G links belong to LTNs, and 3G approach LFNs. For good TCP
   performance both LFNs and LTNs require maintaining a large enough
   window. For LFNs it is needed to utilize the available network
   bandwidth. LTNs need a larger window than required for 'filling the
   pipe' to avoid retransmission timeouts in presence of packet losses. 

   This document recommends only standard-level mechanism suitable both
   for LTNs and LFNs, and to any network in general. However, suggested
   experimental mechanisms can be targeted either for LTN [1] or LFN
   [46]. 

   The data rates are dynamic due to other users and mobility. Arriving
   and departing users can reduce or increase the available bandwidth a
   cell. Traveling to a longer distance from the base station decreases
   the link bandwidth due to worse link quality. Finally, the user can
   move to a cell with less or more of available bandwidth. When a
   connection changes from a slow to fast cell, it can underutilize the
   available bandwidth, since in congestion avoidance phase TCP
   increases the sending rate slowly. Changing from a fast to slow cell
   is handled well by TCP due to self-clocking mechanism. However, a
   large TCP window used in a faster cell can create the overbuffering
   problem in the slower cell. 

2.2 Asymmetry

   2.5G/3G systems have built-in asymmetry in uplink and downlink data
   rates. The uplink data rate is limited by the battery power
   consumption and complexity limitations of mobile terminals. However,
   the asymmetry does not exceed 3-6 times, and can be tolerated by TCP
   without need for congestion control or filtering for ACKs [47]. 

2.3 Latency

   The latency of 2.5G/3G links is very high due to FEC and processing
   delays. A typical RTT varies between half a second to one second.


Inamura, et. al.        Expires August 19, 2002                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft    TCP over 2.5G and 3G Wireless Networks   February 2002


   The high latency of 2.5G/3G links is not of fundamental nature, like
   in satellite links due to finite light speed, but it is unlikely to
   be radically lowered. However, it can be reduced by clever design
   and engineering of the system. 

   The static latency of 2.5G/3G links can be further increased by the
   radio resource allocation delay. For example, the user is allocated
   a timeslot in GPRS and a scrambling code in UMTS. GPRS releases
   timeslots shortly after a transmission; UMTS users can keep the
   codes longer, but the allocation also takes longer time. The
   resource allocation delay has an effect of increasing the RTT on the
   partly utilized link. Until the interval between packet arrivals to
   the link is less than the resource release timer, the resource
   allocation is triggered on every RTT. Keeping the radio resource for
   the time equal to link RTT could avoid this problem. 

2.4 Delay spikes

   A delay spike is a sudden increase in the latency of the
   communication path. 2.5G/3G links are likely to experience delay
   spikes exceeding the typical RTT by several times due to following
   reasons. 

   (1) A long delay spike can be a result of link layer recovery from a
   link outage due to temporal loss of radio coverage for example while
   driving into a tunnel or stepping into an elevator. 

   (2) During a handover the mobile terminal may have to perform some
   time-consuming actions before data can be transmitted in a new cell.
   Many W-WANs in such a case try to provide seamless mobility that is
   internally re-route packets from the old to the new base station at
   the expense of additional delay. 

   (3) Blocking by high-priority traffic may occur when an arriving
   circuit-switch call or higher priority data user temporally preempts
   the radio channel. 

   Delay spikes can cause spurious TCP timeouts and unnecessary
   retransmissions. 

2.5 Packet Loss Due to Corruption

   In corruptive packet, 2.5G/3G systems have low rate of error losses
   thanks to link-level retransmissions. Justification for link layer
   ARQ is discussed in [10], [11]. In general, the link layer ARQ and
   FEC can provide a packet service with a negligibly small probability
   of undetected error (failure of the link CRC), and a low level of
   loss (non-delivery) for the upper layer traffic, i.e. IP. The loss
   rate of IP packets is low due to the ARQ, but the recovery in layer

   two appears as jitter to the higher layers. 

2.6 Intersystem handovers

   It is likely that 3G systems will be used as a 'hot spot' technology
   in high population areas while 2.5G systems will provide lower speed
   data service on the rest of territory. This creates an environment
   where a mobile user can roam between 2.5G and 3G networks while
   keeping ongoing TCP connections. The inter-system handover is likely
   to trigger a high delay spike Section 2.4 and can result in large
   amount of data losses. Additional problems include context transfer,
   which is out of scope of this document but are being addressed
   elsewhere in the IETF in activities addressing seamless mobility
   [48]. 

   Intersystem handovers can cause performance problems for ongoing TCP
   connections as many features (e.g. window scaling) are negotiated at
   the connection establishment and cannot be changed later. This is
   especially a valid concern if some mechanism specific for LTN or LFN
   is implemented by TCP. 

2.7 Bandwidth Oscillation

   Limited RF spectrum along with high data rate requirement of 2.5G/3G
   wireless systems necessitates dynamic resource sharing among
   concurrent data users. Various scheduling mechanisms can be deployed
   in order to maximize resource utilization. Time division sharing of
   these resources may result in TCP throughput degradation. Ideally
   resources are allocated as needed bases (bandwidth on demand) and
   released when there is no data to send. However, if multiple users
   transfer large amount of data at the same time, the scheduler may
   have to repeatedly allocate and de-allocate resources for each user.
   In this section we refer to periodic allocation and de-allocation of
   high-speed channel as Bandwidth Oscillation. Bandwidth Oscillation
   effects such as spurious retransmission were identified elsewhere
   (e.g., [17] ) as throughput degradation factors. There are research
   studies [49], which show that in some cases Bandwidth Oscillation
   can be the single most important factor in reducing throughput. When
   resources are released, suddenly the RTT measurement increases and
   low RTO expires forcing TCP into the Slow Start state, while
   actually none of the TCP segments were lost. 

   One of the ways of detecting congestion in TCP is RTO expiration.
   RTO computation algorithm [32] was designed to follow closely round
   trip time (RTT), but is known to work poorly when delay variance is
   high [11]. When a user has high bandwidth (i.e., low RTT), if
   resources are allocated for a sufficiently long time, RTO converges
   to RTT. 



Inamura, et. al.        Expires August 19, 2002                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft    TCP over 2.5G and 3G Wireless Networks   February 2002


   For fixed TCP parameters the achievable throughput depends on the
   pattern of resource allocation. When the frequency of resource
   allocation and de-allocation is sufficiently high, there is no
   throughput degradation. However, increasing frequency of resource
   allocation/de-allocation may come at the expense of increased
   signaling, and, therefore, may not be desirable in systems which
   have limited capacity. Standards for 3G wireless technologies
   provide other mechanisms that can be used to combat adverse effects
   of Bandwidth Oscillation. It is the consensus of the PILC WG that
   the best approach for avoiding adverse effects of Bandwidth
   Oscillation is proper wireless sub-network design [11]. 

   In systems that do experience bandwidth oscillation, one can control
   throughput degradation by optimizing TCP parameters [49]. One
   obvious method is to adjust computed RTO value (or configure
   appropriately the minimum RTO value) at sending TCP. This technique,
   however, can not be recommended as a practical solution. Experiments
   have shown that RTO algorithm implementation compliant with RFC2988
   [32] (e.g., minimum RTO=1 sec and initial RTO=3 sec) reduce number
   of spurious re-transmissions. Although RTO timer management
   specified in RFC2988 is not mandatory, implementation of
   retransmission timer restart when an ACK is received (section 5.3 of
   RFC2988) will further reduce (or even eliminate) spurious
   retransmissions. Secondary effects, such as TCP segment loss, in
   combination with Bandwidth Oscillation may not allow avoiding all
   spurious re-transmissions. 

   Analysis of RTO algorithm along with an alternative (Eifel)
   algorithm are presented in [17]. Eifel algorithm requires timestamp
   option and at least one RTO expiration before TCP "learns" that
   retransmission was not necessary. D-SACK option [26] also allows TCP
   sender to detect spurious RTO expirations. Enabling timestamp option
   enables increased RTT sampling which can reduce spurious
   re-transmissions due to Bandwidth Oscillation. Other options that
   could reduce spurious RTO expirations due to Bandwidth Oscillation
   are increase CWND and reduced delay ACK timer at Receiving TCP to <
   100 ms (however, this technique may have side effects in case
   bandwidth is limited in the opposite direction).

3. 2.5G and 3G deployments

   This section provides further details on a specific 2.5G/3G
   technology, namely, Wideband CDMA (W-CDMA), CDMA2000 and GPRS. Other
   pilc documents discusses elemental technologies in more detail. ARQ
   and FEC are discussed in[1]. Justification for link layer ARQ is
   discussed in [9], [11]. 

3.1 W-CDMA

   The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has selected
   Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (W-CDMA) as one of the global
   telecom systems for the IMT-2000 3G mobile communications standard.
   W-CDMA specification is created in 3rd Generation Partnership
   Project (3GPP). 

   The link layer characteristics of the 3G network affects TCP
   performance over the link. The key components of the characteristics
   are error controlling schemes such as layer two ARQ (L2 ARQ) and FEC
   (forward error correction). 

   W-CDMA (Wideband CDMA) uses RLC (Radio Link Control) [2], a
   Selective Repeat and sliding window ARQ. RLC uses protocol data
   units (PDUs) with a 16 bit RLC header. There is an implementation
   with a 336 bit PDU[25]. This is the unit for link layer
   retransmission. The IP packet is fragmented into PDUs for
   transmission by RLC (For more fragmentation discussion, see Section
   4.4). 

   In W-CDMA, one to twelve PDUs (RLC frames) constitute one FEC frame.
   The actual size of the FEC frame depends on the link conditions and
   bandwidth allocation. The FEC frame is the unit of interleaving. It
   is the accumulation of PDUs for FEC that adds the latency mentioned
   in Section 2.3. 

   For reliable transfer, RLC has an acknowledge mode for PDU
   retransmission. RLC uses checkpoint ARQ [9]. using "status report"
   type acknowledgments: the poll bit in the header explicitly solicits
   the peer for a status report containing the sequence number that the
   peer acknowledged. The use of the poll bit is controlled by timers
   and by the size of available buffer space in RLC. Also, when the
   peer detects a gap between sequence numbers in received frames, it
   can issue a status report to invoke retransmission. RLC preserves
   the order of packet delivery. 

   The maximum number of retransmissions is a configurable RLC
   parameter that is specified by RRC [33] (Radio Resource Controller)
   through RLC connection initialization. The RRC can give the maximum
   number of retransmissions up to 40. Therefore, RLC can be described


Inamura, et. al.        Expires August 19, 2002                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft    TCP over 2.5G and 3G Wireless Networks   February 2002


   as an ARQ that can be configured for either HIGH-PERSISTENCE or
   LOW-PERSISTENCE, not PERFECT-PERSISTENCE, according to the
   terminology in [9]. 

   The RRC manages RLC connection state. The Bandwidth Oscillation
   (Section 2.7) can be eliminated by controlling RRC to keep RF
   resource on the RLC connection when it holds data in their queue; in
   other words, avoids resource de-allocation in the middle of
   transferring data as possible. 

   In summary, the link layer ARQ and FEC can provide a packet service
   with a negligibly small probability of undetected error (failure of
   the link CRC), and a low level of loss (non-delivery) for the upper
   layer traffic, i.e. IP. Retransmission of PDUs by ARQ introduces
   latency and jitter to the IP flow.  This is why the transport layer
   sees the underlying W-CDMA network as a network with a relatively
   large BDP (Bandwidth-Delay Product), the typical values may range
   around 50KB for 384 Kbps RF allocation. 

3.2 CDMA2000

   One of the Terrestrial Radio Interface standards for 3G wireless
   systems, proposed under the International Mobile
   Telecommunications-2000 umbrella, is cdma2000 [51]. It employs
   Multi-Carrier Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology with a
   single-carrier RF bandwidth of 1.25 MHz. cdma2000 was evolved from
   IS-95 [52], a 2G standard based on CDMA technology. The first phase
   of cdma2000 utilizes a single carrier and is designed to double
   voice capacity of existing CDMA (IS-95) networks and to support
   always-on data transmission speeds of up to 316.8 kbps. At the
   physical layer, standard allows transmission in 5,10,20,40 or 80 ms
   time frames. Various orthogonal (Walsh) codes are used for channel
   identification and achieving higher data rates. 

   Radio Link Protocol Type 3 (RLP) [53] is used with a cdma2000
   Traffic Channel to support CDMA data services. RLP provides an octet
   stream transport service and is unaware of higher layer framing.
   There are several RLP frame formats. RLP frame formats with higher
   payload were designed for higher data rates. Depending on the
   channel speed, one or more RLP frames can be transmitted in a single
   physical layer frame. 

   RLP can substantially decrease the error rate exhibited by CDMA
   traffic channels. When transferring data, RLP is a pure NAK-based
   finite selective repeat protocol. The receiver does not acknowledge
   successfully received data frames. If one or more RLP data frames
   are missing, the receiving RLP makes several attempts (called NAK
   rounds) to recover them by sending one or more NAK control frames to
   the transmitter. Each NAK frame must be sent in a separate physical


Inamura, et. al.        Expires August 19, 2002                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft    TCP over 2.5G and 3G Wireless Networks   February 2002


   layer frame. When RLP supplies the last NAK control frame of a
   particular NAK round, a retransmission timer is set. If the missing
   frame is not received when the timer expires, RLP may try another
   NAK round. RLP may not recover all missing frames. If after all RLP
   rounds, a frame is still missing, RLP supplies data with a missing
   frame to the higher layer protocols. 

3.3 GPRS, HSCSD, and EDGE

   The second generation cellular systems are commonly referred as 2G.
   The 2G phase began in the 1990s when digital voice encoding had
   replaced analog systems (1G). 2G systems are based on various radio
   technologies including frequency-, code- and time- division multiple
   access. Examples of 2G systems include GSM (Europe), PDC (Japan),
   and IS-95 (USA). Data links provided by 2G systems are mostly
   circuit-switched and have transmission speed of 10-20 kbps uplink
   and downlink. Demand for higher data rates, instant availability and
   data volume-based charging, as well as lack of radio spectrum
   allocated for 2G led to the introduction of 2.5G (GPRS, EDGE, PDC-P)
   and 3G (Wideband CDMA, cdma2000) systems. 

   High Speed Circuit-Switched Data (HSCSD) and General Packet Radio
   Service (GPRS) are extensions of GSM providing high data rates for a
   user. Both extensions are developed first by ETSI and later by 3GPP.
   In GSM, a user is assigned one timeslot downlink and one uplink.
   HSCSD allocates multiple timeslots to a user creating a fast
   circuit-switched link. GPRS is based on packet-switched technology
   that allows efficient sharing of radio resources among users and
   always-on capability.  A GPRS terminal can utilize up to eight
   timeslots per direction. Additionally, several terminals can share
   timeslots. GPRS network uses an updated base station subsystem of
   GSM as the access network; the GPRS core network includes Serving
   GPRS Support Node (SGSN) and Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN). The
   RLC protocol operating between a base station controller and a
   terminal provides ARQ capability over radio link. The Logical Link
   Control (LLC) protocol between SGSN and terminal also has ARQ
   capability utilized during handovers. 

   Enhanced Data for Global Evolution (EDGE) is a new modulation
   technique and new channel coding that increases throughput and
   capacity of the radio link. EDGE applied to GPRS (EGPRS) or HSCSD
   (ECSD) can increase the data rate threefold for a single user.

4. TCP over 2.5G and 3G

   What follows is a set of recommendations for configuration
   parameters for protocol stacks which will be used to support TCP
   connections over 2.5g and 3g wireless networks.  Some of these
   recommendations imply special configuration at the data receiver,
   frequently a stack at or near the wireless device, some at the data
   sender, frequently a host in the Internet or possibly an gateway or
   proxy at the edge of a wireless network, and some at both. 

   All the configuration options in this section are found in modern
   TCP stacks and are widely available and may be used safely on the
   general Internet.  Even hosts which serve predominantly non-wireless
   users may safely enable these options.  System administrators are
   cautioned, however, that setting MTU size (Section 4.1.4) and
   disabling Van Jacobosen header compression (Section 4.1.9) could
   affect host efficiency and changing such parameters should be done
   with care. 

4.1 Large window size (sender & receiver)

   The traditional TCP specification [38] limits the receiver window
   size to 64 KB. If the end-to-end capacity is expected to be larger
   than 64 KB, the window scale option [5] can overcome that
   limitation. TCP over 2.5G/3G should support appropriate window sizes
   based on the Bandwidth Delay Product (BDP) of the end-to-end path.
   If the estimated path BDP is larger than 64 KB, the window scale
   option may be used. Many operating systems by default use small TCP
   receive and send buffers around 16KB. Therefore, even for
   bandwidth-delay product below 64 KB, the default buffer size setting
   should be increased at the sender and at the receiver to allow a
   large enough window 

4.2 Large initial window (sender)

   TCP controls its transmit rate using the congestion window
   mechanism. Traditionally, the initial value of the window is one
   segment. Because the delayed Ack mechanism is the standard, a TCP
   sender should have an increased initial congestion window of two
   segments[3]. This effectively cancels the delayed Ack by sending two
   segments at once in the first RTT of slow start, which helps avoid
   overhead in the initial phase of the connection. 

   Furthermore, the increased initial window mechanism [4] is also
   effective, especially for the transmission of small amounts of data,
   which is the behavior commonly seen in such applications as
   Internet-enabled mobile wireless devices. For large data transfers,
   on the other hand, the effect of this mechanism is negligible. [6]
   describes evaluations of this mechanism by measurements. 


Inamura, et. al.        Expires August 19, 2002                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft    TCP over 2.5G and 3G Wireless Networks   February 2002


   An initial congestion window size of two segments is recommended in
   RFC2581[3]. RFC2414[4] also considers the use of an initial window
   size larger than two segments. At the time of writing RFC2414 has
   been proposed to become a standards track RFC. 

   Due to the fact that the delayed Ack mechanism is the standard
   RFC2581[3], and that the increased initial window option is
   especially effective for the small data transfers that are common
   for mobile wireless devices, TCP over 2.5G/3G should use initial
   CWND (congestion window) = 2 segments. It may use a CWND > 2
   segments between a internet host and a mobile node. 

4.3 Limited Transmit (sender)

   RFC3042[27], Limited Transmit, extends Fast Retransmit/Fast Recovery
   for TCP connections with small congestion windows that are not
   likely to generate the three duplicate acknowledgements required to
   trigger Fast Retransmit. The mechanism calls for sending a new data
   segment in response to each of the first two duplicate
   acknowledgments that arrive at the sender. This mechanism is
   effective when the congestion window size is small or if a large
   number of segments in a window are lost. This may reduce the amount
   of retransmission due to TCP round trip timeout. Similar to the
   discussion in Section 4.2, this mechanism is useful for small
   amounts of data to be transmitted. TCP over 2.5G/3G implementations
   should implement Limited Transmit. 

4.4 Large MTU

   One of the link layer parameters is MTU (Maximum Transfer Unit). In
   TCP, the slow start mechanism tries to find an adequate rate for the
   network path. A larger MTU allows TCP to increase the congestion
   window faster [10], because the window is counted in units of
   segments. In links with high error rates, a smaller link PDU size
   increases the chance of successful transmission. With layer two ARQ
   and transparent link layer fragmentation, the network layer can
   enjoy a larger MTU even in a relatively high BER (Bit Error Rate)
   condition. Without these features in the link, a smaller MTU is
   suggested. TCP over 2.5G/3G should allow freedom for designers to
   choose MTU values ranging from small values (such as 576 bytes) to a
   large value that is supported by the type of link in use (such as
   1500 bytes for IP packets on Ethernet), designers are generally
   encouraged to choose large values. 

4.5 Path MTU discovery (sender)

   Path MTU discovery allows a sender to determine the maximum
   end-to-end transmission unit (without IP fragmentation) for a given
   routing path. RFC1191[19] and RFC1981[21] describe the MTU discovery


Inamura, et. al.        Expires August 19, 2002                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft    TCP over 2.5G and 3G Wireless Networks   February 2002


   procedure for IPv4 and IPv6 respectively. This allows TCP senders to
   employ larger segment sizes (without causing IP layer fragmentation)
   instead of assuming the small default MTU.  TCP over 2.5G/3G
   implementations should implement Path MTU Discovery. Path MTU
   Discovery requires intermediate routers to support the generation of
   the necessary ICMP messages. RFC1435[20] provides recommendations
   that may be relevant for some router implementations. 

4.6 Selective Acknowledgments (sender & receiver)

   The selective acknowledgment option (SACK), RFC2018[7], is effective
   when multiple TCP segments are lost in a single TCP window[12]. In
   particular, if the end-to-end path has a large BDP and a certain
   packet loss rate, the probability of multiple segment losses in a
   single window of data increases. In such cases, SACK provides
   reliability beyond traditional and Reno TCP[8]. TCP over 2.5G/3G
   should support SACK. 

   In the absence of SACK feature, the TCP may use NewReno RFC2582[39]
   as a fallback semantics. 

4.7 Explicit Congestion Notification (sender & receiver)

   Explicit Congestion Notification, RFC3168[23], allows a TCP receiver
   to inform the sender of congestion in the network by setting the
   ECN-Echo flag upon receiving an IP packet marked with the CE bit(s).
   The TCP sender will then reduce its congestion window. Thus, the use
   of ECN is believed to provide performance benefits[22]. TCP over
   2.5G/3G may support ECN. RFC3168[23] also places requirements on
   intermediate routers (e.g. active queue management and setting of
   the CE bit(s) in the IP header to indicate congestion). Therefore,
   the potential improvement in performance can only be achieved when
   ECN capable routers are deployed along the path. 

4.8 TCP timestamp option (sender & receiver)

   Traditionally, TCPs collect one RTT sample per window of data [38].
   This can lead to an underestimation of the RTT, and spurious
   timeouts on bandwidth-dominated paths. This holds despite a
   conservative retransmit timer such as the one proposed in RFC2988
   [32]. In general, TCP connections with a window larger than eight
   segments require more frequent RTT measurements [44]. Timing every
   segment can be implemented with or without the TCP Timestamps option
   [5]. Using the TCP Timestamps option has the advantage that
   retransmitted segments can be used for RTT measurement, which is
   otherwise forbidden by Karn's algorithm [40]. Furthermore, the TCP
   Timestamps option is the basis for detecting spurious retransmits
   using the Eifel algorithm [17]. 



Inamura, et. al.        Expires August 19, 2002                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft    TCP over 2.5G and 3G Wireless Networks   February 2002


   On paths where the packet transmission delay across the bottleneck
   link dominates the path's RTT, the queuing delay and hence the RTT
   can increase rapidly during the slow start phase. When RTT samples
   are collected once per window, the RTO value applied just before
   taking a new RTT sample can underestimate the current RTT.
   Experiments using NS2 show that in this case a spurious timeout
   during fast recovery can occur even without any delay spike [42].
   Enabling timestamps significantly increases the maximum delay spike
   tolerated by TCP without experiencing a spurious timeout. In
   summary, timing every segment avoids the effect of an RTO lagging
   behind a rapidly increasing RTT. This decreases the likelihood of a
   spurious timeout. Additionally, timestamps reduce the likelihood of
   spurious timeouts due to bandwidth oscillation [49]. 

   The only problematic issue about using timestamp seems to be the 12
   bytes overhead introduced by carrying the TCP Timestamps option and
   padding in the TCP header. For a small MTU size, it can present a
   considerable overhead. For example, for an MTU of 296 bytes the
   added overhead is 4 %. For an MTU of 1500 bytes, the added overhead
   is only 0.8 %. TCP/IP header compression RFC1144[43] does not
   support compressing headers with options. Thus, using the TCP
   Timestamps option effectively disables it. However, in many cases
   TCP/IP header compression is not used anyway due to poor performance
   in presence of packet losses [41]. The IETF is currently specifying
   a robust TCP/IP header compression scheme that supports TCP options
   [16][34]. 

   The original definition of the timestamp option [5] specifies that
   duplicate segments below cumulative ACK do not update the cached
   timestamp value at the receiver. This may lead to overestimating of
   RTT for retransmitted segments. A possible solution [45] allows the
   receiver to use a more recent timestamp from a duplicate segment.
   However, this suggestion allows for spoofing attacks at the TCP
   receiver. Therefore,  careful consideration is needed in
   implementing this solution. 

   Recommendation: TCP SHOULD use the TCP Timestamps option. It allows
   better RTT estimation, reduces the risk of spurious timeouts, and
   enables the detection of spurious retransmits using the Eifel
   algorithm. 

4.9 Disabling Van Jacobson TCP/IP Header Compression (wireless host)

   Van Jacobson TCP/IP header compression (VJC) algorithm RFC1144[35]
   is negotiated between peer PPP layers. The algorithm was designed to
   increase application layer throughput by reducing packetization
   overhead [11]. For TCP segment size of 1000 Bytes, enabling VJC
   increases throughput by about 4%, if there is no packet loss. 



Inamura, et. al.        Expires August 19, 2002                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft    TCP over 2.5G and 3G Wireless Networks   February 2002


   However, experiments have shown that in the presence of wireless
   link errors, VJC is not desirable [49]. If a wireless link error is
   not recovered, it will cause TCP segment loss between peer PPP
   layers, and then VJC does not allow TCP to take advantage of Fast
   Retransmit Fast Recovery mechanism. VJC algorithm transmits not the
   TCP/IP headers but only the changes in the headers of consecutive
   segments. Therefore, loss of a TCP segment on the VJC link causes
   the transmitting and receiving TCP sequence numbers to go out of
   synch. When a TCP segment is lost, none of the following segment
   will be forwarded by the link until RTO expires [11]. 

   It is recommended to disable VJC algorithm unless packet loss
   between peer PPP layers is very low. Robust Header Compression [34]
   was designed to address deficiencies of VJC. At the time of writing
   of this document, IETF was working on a proposal for negotiating
   Robust Header Compression over PPP [50].

5. Open Issues

   This section outlines additional mechanisms and parameter settings
   that may increase the end-to-end performance when running TCP across
   2.5G/3G networks. Note, that apart from the discussion of the RTO's
   initial value, those mechanisms and parameter settings are not part
   of any standards track RFC at the timing of writing, and can
   therefore not be recommended internet in general. 

   Link layer mechanisms for increasing TCP performance include
   enhanced TCP/IP header compression schemes [16], and active queue
   management RFC2309[15], link layer retransmission schemes [11], and
   holding on to packets during transient link outages [11].
   Shortcomings of existing TCP/IP header compression schemes
   RFC1144[35], RFC2507[36] are that headers of handshaking packets
   (SYNs and FINs), and TCP option fields (e.g., SACK or timestamps)
   are not compressed. In fact, the presence of timestamps effectively
   disables header compression based on RFC1144[35]. Although
   RFC3095[34] does not yet address this issue, the ROHC working group
   is developing schemes to compress TCP headers, including options
   such as timestamps and selective acknowledgements. Especially, if
   many short-lived TCP connections run across the link, the
   compression of the handshaking packets may greatly improve the
   overall header compression ratio. Implementing active queue
   management is attractive for a number of reasons as outlined in
   RFC2309[15]. One important benefit for 2.5G/3G networks, is that it
   minimizes the amount of potentially stale data that may be queued in
   the network ("clicking from page to page" before the download of the
   previous page is complete). Avoiding the transmission of stale data
   across the 2.5G/3G radio link saves transmission (battery) power,
   and increases goodput (the ratio of useful data over total data
   transmitted). Another important benefit of active queue management
   for 2.5G/3G networks, is that it reduces the risk of a spurious
   timeout for the first data segment as outlined below. 

   Finding ways to avoid the path round-trip times required for TCP's
   connection setup and disconnect is particularly attractive for
   2.5G/3G networks since these networks are commonly characterized by
   high delays. This would be particularly beneficial for short-lived,
   transactional (request/response-style) TCP sessions that typically
   result from browsing the Web from a smart phone. However, existing
   solutions such as T/TCP RFC1644[14], have not been adopted due to
   known security concerns [31]. 

   Spurious timeouts RFC3150[10], packet re-ordering, and packet
   duplication may reduce TCP's performance. Thus, making TCP more
   robust against those events is desirable. Solutions to this problem
   have been proposed [17], [26], [37], and standardization work within
   the IETF is ongoing at the time of writing. Those solutions include


Inamura, et. al.        Expires August 19, 2002                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft    TCP over 2.5G and 3G Wireless Networks   February 2002


   reversing congestion control state after such an event has been
   detected, and adapting the retransmission timer and duplicate
   acknowledgement threshold. The deployment of such solutions may be
   particularly beneficial when running TCP across wireless networks.
   This is since wireless access links may often be subject to
   handovers and resource preemption, or the mobile transmitter may
   traverse through a radio coverage hole. Such disrupting events may
   easily trigger a spurious timeout despite a conservative
   retransmission timer. Also, the mobility mechanisms of some wireless
   networks may cause packet duplication. 

   The algorithm for computing TCP's retransmission timer is specified
   in RFC2988[32]. The standard specifies that the initial setting of
   the retransmission timeout value (RTO) must not be less than 3
   seconds. This value might be too low when running TCP across 2.5G/3G
   networks. In addition to its high latencies, those networks may be
   run at bit rates of as low as about 10 kb/s which results in large
   transmission delays. In this case, the RTT for the first data
   segment may easily go beyond the initial TCP retransmission timer
   setting of 3 seconds. This would then cause a spurious timeout for
   that segment. Hence, in such situations it may be advisable to set
   TCP's initial RTO to a value larger than 3 seconds. Furthermore, due
   to the potentially large transmissions delays, a TCP sender might
   choose to refrain from initializing its RTO from the RTT measured
   for the SYN, but instead take the RTT measured for the first data
   segment.

6. Security Considerations

   In 2.5G/3G wireless networks, data is transmitted as ciphertext over
   the air and as cleartext between the Radio Access Network (RAN) and
   the core network. IP security RFC2411[29] or TLS RFC2246[28] can be
   deployed by user devices for end-to-end security. The use of a
   transport gateway introduces conflicts with IPsec; however TLS can
   be used in such architectures.
