   1. Introduction

   This draft provides an information model for Abstraction and Control
   of Traffic Engineered Networks (ACTN). The information model
   described in this document covers the interface requirements
   identified in the ACTN architecture and framework document [ACTN-
   Frame].

   The ACTN reference architecture [ACTN-Frame] identifies a three-tier
   control hierarchy comprising the following as depicted in Figure 1:

      - Customer Network Controllers (CNCs)
      - Multi-Domain Service Coordinator (MDSC)
      - Provisioning Network Controllers (PNCs).

               Figure 1: A Three-tier ACTN control hierarchy



   The two interfaces with respect to the MDSC, one north of the MDSC
   and the other south of the MDSC are referred to as CMI (CNC-MDSC
   Interface) and MPI (MDSC-PNC Interface), respectively. This document
   models these two interfaces and derivative interfaces thereof (e.g.,
   MDSC to MDSC in a hierarchy of MDSCs) as a single common interface.

1.1. Terminology

   The terms "Virtual Network (VN)" and "Virtual Network Service (VNS)"
   are defined in [ACTN-Frame] and the other key terms such as
   "abstraction", "abstract topology", "Path", "VN node", and "VN link"
   are defined in [RFC7926].

2. ACTN Common Interfaces Information Model

   This section provides an ACTN common interface information model to
   describe primitives, objects, their properties (represented as
   attributes), their relationships, and the resources for the service
   applications needed in the ACTN context.

   The standard interface is described between a client controller and
   a server controller. A client-server relationship is recursive
   between a CNC and an MDSC and between an MDSC and a PNC. In the CMI,


Lee & Belotti, et al.    Expire December 2018                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft              ACTN Info Model              June 2018


   the client is a CNC while the server is an MDSC. In the MPI, the
   client is an MDSC and the server is a PNC. There may also be MDSC-
   MDSC interface(s) that need to be supported. This may arise in a
   hierarchy of MDSCs in which workloads may need to be partitioned to
   multiple MDSCs.

   Basic primitives (messages) are required between the CNC-MDSC and
   MDSC-PNC controllers. These primitives can then be used to support
   different ACTN network control functions like network topology
   request/query, VN service request, path computation and connection
   control, VN service policy negotiation, enforcement, routing
   options, etc.

   There are two different types of primitives depending on the type of
   interface:

     - Virtual Network primitives at CMI
     - Traffic Engineering primitives at MPI

   As well described in [ACTN-Frame], at the CMI level, there is no
   need for detailed TE information since the basic functionality is to
   translate customer service information into virtual network service
   operation.

   At the MPI level, MDSC has the main scope for multi-domain
   coordination and creation of a single e2e abstracted network view
   which is strictly related to TE information.

   As for topology, this document employs two types of topology:

      - The first type is referred to as virtual network topology which
        is associated with a VN. Virtual network topology is a
        customized topology for view and control by the customer. See
        Section 3.1 for details.

      - The second type is referred to as TE topology which is
        associated with provider network operation on which we can
        apply policy to obtain the required level of abstraction to
        represent the underlying physical network topology.

3. Virtual Network primitives

   This section provides a list of main VN primitives related to
   virtual network which are necessary to satisfy ACTN requirements
   specified in [ACTN-REQ]

   The following VN Action primitives are supported:

Internet-Draft              ACTN Info Model              June 2018


   - VN Instantiate

   - VN Modify

   - VN Delete

   - VN Update

   - VN Path Compute

   - VN Query

   VN Action is an object describing the main VN primitives.

   VN Action can assume one of the mentioned above primitives values.

   <VN Action> ::= <VN Instantiate> |

                   <VN Modify> |

                   <VN Delete> |

                   <VN Update> |

                   <VN Path Compute> |

                   <VN Query>

   All these actions will solely happen at CMI level between Customer
   Network Controller (CNC) and Multi Domain Service Coordinator
   (MDSC).

3.1. VN Instantiate

   VN Instantiate refers to an action from customers/applications to
   request the creation of VNs. VN Instantiate is for CNC-to-MDSC
   communication. Depending on the agreement between client and
   provider, VN instantiate can imply different VN operations. There
   are two types of VN instantiation:

   VN type 1: VN is viewed as a set of edge-to-edge links (VN members).

   VN type 2: VN is viewed as a VN-topology comprising virtual nodes
   and virtual links.

   Please see [ACTN-Frame] for full details regarding the types of VN.

Internet-Draft              ACTN Info Model              June 2018




3.2. VN Modify

   VN Modify refers to an action issued from customers/applications to
   modify an existing VN (i.e., an instantiated VN). VN Modify is for
   CNC-to-MDSC communication.

   VN Modify, depending of the type of VN instantiated, can be a
   modification of the characteristics of VN members (edge-to-edge
   links) in case of VN type 1, or a modification of an existing
   virtual topology (e.g., adding/deleting virtual nodes/links) in case
   of VN type 2.

3.3. VN Delete

   VN Delete refers to an action issued from customers/applications to
   delete an existing VN. VN Delete is for CNC-to-MDSC communication.



3.4. VN Update

   VN Update refers to any update to the VN that needs to be updated to
   the customers. VN Update is MDSC-to-CNC communication. VN Update
   fulfills a push model at CMI level, to make customers aware of any
   specific changes in the topology details related to the instantiated
   VN.

   VN Update, depending of the type of VN instantiated, can be an
   update of VN members (edge-to-edge links) in case of VN type 1, or
   an update of virtual topology in case of VN type 2.

   The connection-related information (e.g., LSPs) update association
   with VNs will be part of the "translation" function that happens in
   MDSC to map/translate VN request into TE semantics. This information
   will be provided in case customer optionally wants to have more
   detailed TE information associated with the instantiated VN.

3.5. VN Compute

   VN Compute consists of Request and Reply. Request refers to an
   action from customers/applications to request a VN computation.

   VN Compute Reply refers to the reply in response to VN Compute
   Request.



Lee & Belotti, et al.    Expire December 2018                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft              ACTN Info Model              June 2018


   VN Compute Request/Reply is to be differentiated from a VN
   Instantiate. The purpose of VN Compute is a priori exploration to
   compute network resources availability and getting a possible VN
   view in which path details can be specified matching
   customer/applications constraints. This a priori exploration may not
   guarantee the availability of the computed network resources at the
   time of instantiation.

3.6. VN Query

   VN Query refers to an inquiry pertaining to a VN that has already
   been instantiated. VN Query fulfills a pull model that permits
   getting a topology view.

   VN Query Reply refers to the reply in response to VN Query. The
   topology view returned by VN Query Reply would be consistent with
   the topology type instantiated for any specific VN.

4. Traffic Engineering (TE) primitives

   This section provides a list of the main TE primitives necessary to
   satisfy ACTN requirements specified in [ACTN-REQ] related to typical
   TE operations supported at the MPI level.

   The TE action primitives defined in this section should be supported
   at the MPI consistently with the type of topology defined at the
   CMI.

   The following TE action primitives are supported:

   - TE Instantiate/Modify/Delete

   - TE Topology Update (See Section 4.4. for the description)

   - Path Compute

   TE Action is an object describing the main TE primitives.

   TE Action can assume one of the mentioned above primitives values.

   <TE Action> ::= <TE Instantiate> |

                   <TE Modify> |

                   <TE Delete> |

                   <TE Topology Update> |


Lee & Belotti, et al.    Expire December 2018                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft              ACTN Info Model              June 2018


                   <Path Compute> |



   All these actions will solely happen at MPI level between Multi
   Domain Service Coordinator (MDSC) and Provisioning Network
   Controller (PNC).



4.1. TE Instantiate

   TE Instantiate refers to an action issued from MDSC to PNC to
   instantiate new TE tunnels.

4.2. TE Modify

   TE Modify refers to an action issued from MDSC to PNC to modify
   existing TE tunnels.

4.3. TE Delete

   TE Delete refers to an action issued from MDSC to PNC to delete
   existing TE tunnels.



4.4. TE Topology Update (for TE resources)


   TE Topology Update is a primitive specifically related to MPI to
   provide TE resource update between any domain controller towards
   MDSC regarding the entire content of any "domain controller" actual
   TE topology or an abstracted filtered view of TE topology depending
   on negotiated policy.

   See [TE-TOPO] for detailed YANG implementation of TE topology
   update.


   <TE Topology Update> ::= <TE-topology-list>

   <TE-topology-list> ::= <TE-topology> [<TE-topology-list>]

   <TE-topology> ::= [<Abstraction>] <TE-Topology-identifier> <Node-
   list> <Link-list>


Lee & Belotti, et al.    Expire December 2018                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft              ACTN Info Model              June 2018


   <Node-list> ::= <Node>[<Node-list>]

   <Node> ::= <Node> <TE Termination Point-list>

   <TE Termination Point-list> ::= <TE Termination Point> [<TE-
   Termination Point-list>]

   <Link-list> ::= <Link>[<Link-list>]

   Where

   Abstraction provides information on level of abstraction (as
   determined a priori).

   TE-topology-identifier is an identifier that identifies a specific
   te-topology, e.g., te-types:te-topology-id [TE-TOPO].

   Node-list is detailed information related to a specific node
   belonging to a te-topology, e.g., te-node-attributes [TE-TOPO].

   Link-list is information related to the specific link related
   belonging to a te-topology, e.g., te-link-attributes [TE-TOPO].

   TE Termination Point-list is detailed information associated with
   the termination points of te-link related to a specific node, e.g.,
   interface-switching-capability [TE-TOPO].



4.5. Path Compute

   Path Compute consists of Request and Reply. Request refers to an
   action from MDSC to PNC to request a path computation.

   Path Compute Reply refers to the reply in response to Path Compute
   Request.

   The context of Path Compute is described in [Path-Compute].



5. VN Objects

   This section provides a list of objects associated to VN action
   primitives.

Internet-Draft              ACTN Info Model              June 2018


5.1. VN Identifier

   VN Identifier is a unique identifier of the VN.

5.2. VN Service Characteristics

   VN Service Characteristics describes the customer/application
   requirements against the VNs to be instantiated.

   <VN Service Characteristics> ::= <VN Connectivity Type>

                                    <VN Directionality>

                                    (<VN Traffic Matrix>...)

                                    <VN Survivability>

   Where

   <VN Connectivity Type> ::= <P2P>|<P2MP>|<MP2MP>|<MP2P>|<Multi-
   destination>

   The Connectivity Type identifies the type of required VN Service. In
   addition to the classical type of services (e.g. P2P/P2MP etc.),
   ACTN defines the "multi-destination" service that is a new P2P
   service where the end points are not fixed. They can be chosen among
   a list of pre-configured end points or dynamically provided by the
   CNC.

   VN Directionality indicates if a VN is unidirectional or
   bidirectional. This implies that each VN member that belongs to the
   VN has the same directionality as the VN.

   <VN Traffic Matrix> ::= <Bandwidth>

                           [<VN Constraints>]

   The VN Traffic Matrix represents the traffic matrix parameters for
   the required service connectivity. Bandwidth is a mandatory
   parameter and a number of optional constraints can be specified in
   the VN Constraints (e.g. diversity, cost). They can include
   objective functions and TE metrics bounds as specified in [RFC5541].

   Further details on the VN constraints are specified below:

         <VN Constraints> ::= [<Layer Protocol>]



Lee & Belotti, et al.    Expire December 2018                 [Page 11]

Internet-Draft              ACTN Info Model              June 2018


                              [<Diversity>]

                              ( <Metric> | <VN Objective Function> )

      Where:

      Layer Protocol identifies the layer topology at which the VN
      service is requested. It could be for example MPLS, ODU, and OCh.

      Diversity allows asking for diversity constraints for a VN
      Instantiate/Modify or a VN Path Compute. For example, a new VN or
      a path is requested in total diversity from an existing one (e.g.
      diversity exclusion).

            <Diversity> ::= (<VN-exclusion> (<VN-id>...)) |

                     (<VN-Member-exclusion> (<VN-Member-id>...))

      Metric can include all the Metrics (cost, delay, delay variation,
      latency), bandwidth utilization parameters defined and referenced
      by [RFC3630] and [RFC7471].

      As for VN Objective Function See Section 5.4.

   VN Survivability describes all attributes related to the VN recovery
   level and its survivability policy enforced by the
   customers/applications.

      <VN Survivability> ::= <VN Recovery Level>

                              [<VN Tunnel Recovery Level>]

                              [<VN Survivability Policy>]

         Where:

         VN Recovery Level is a value representing the requested level
         of resiliency required against the VN. The following values
         are defined:

         . Unprotected VN
         . VN with per tunnel recovery: The recovery level is defined
            against the tunnels composing the VN and it is specified in
            the VN Tunnel Recovery Level.

         <VN Tunnel Recovery Level> ::= <0:1>|<1+1>|<1:1>|<1:N>|<M:N>|

                              <On the fly restoration>

         The VN Tunnel Recovery Level indicates the type of protection
         or restoration mechanism applied to the VN. It augments the
         recovery types defined in [RFC4427].

         <VN Survivability Policy> ::= [<Local Reroute Allowed>]

                                       [<Domain Preference>]

                                       [<Push Allowed>]

                                       [<Incremental Update>]





         Where:

          Local Reroute Allowed is a delegation policy to the Server to
          allow or not a local reroute fix upon a failure of the
          primary LSP.

          Domain Preference is only applied on the MPI where the MDSC
          (client) provides a domain preference to each PNC (server),
          e.g., when an inter-domain link fails, then PNC can choose
          the alternative peering with this info.

          Push Allowed is a policy that allows a server to trigger an
          updated VN topology upon failure without an explicit request
          from the client. Push action can be set as default unless
          otherwise specified.

          Incremental Update is another policy that triggers an
          incremental update from the server since the last period of
          update. Incremental update can be set as default unless
          otherwise specified.

5.3. VN End-Point

   VN End-Point Object describes the VN's customer end-point
   characteristics.

   <VN End-Point> ::= (<Access Point Identifier>

                      [<Access Link Capability>]


Lee & Belotti, et al.    Expire December 2018                 [Page 13]

Internet-Draft              ACTN Info Model              June 2018


                      [<Source Indicator>])...

      Where:

     Access Point Identifier represents a unique identifier of the
     client end-point. They are used by the customer to ask for the
     setup of a virtual network instantiation. A VN End-Point is
     defined against each AP in the network and is shared between
     customer and provider. Both the customer and the provider will map
     it against their own physical resources.

     Access Link Capability identifies the capabilities of the access
     link related to the given access point. (e.g., max-bandwidth,
     bandwidth availability, etc.)

     Source Indicator indicates if an end-point is source or not.





5.4. VN Objective Function

   The VN Objective Function applies to each VN member (i.e., each E2E
   tunnel) of a VN.

   The VN Objective Function can reuse objective functions defined in
   [RFC5541] section 4.

   For a single path computation, the following objective functions are
   defined:

          o MCP is the Minimum Cost Path with respect to a specific
             metric (e.g. shortest path).
          o MLP is the Minimum Load Path, that means find a path
             composted by te-link least loaded.
          o MBP is the Maximum residual Bandwidth Path.


   For a concurrent path computation, the following objective functions
   are defined:

          o MBC is to Minimize aggregate Bandwidth Consumption.
          o MLL is to Minimize the Load of the most loaded Link.
          o MCC is to Minimize the Cumulative Cost of a set of paths.

5.5. VN Action Status

   VN Action Status is the status indicator whether the VN has been
   successfully instantiated, modified, or deleted in the server
   network or not in response to a particular VN action.

   Note that this action status object can be implicitly indicated and
   thus not included in any of the VN primitives discussed in Section
   3.

5.6. VN Topology

   When a VN is seen by the customer as a topology, it is referred to
   as VN topology. This is associated with VN Type 2, which is composed
   of virtual nodes and virtual links.

   <VN Topology> ::= <VN node list> <VN link list>

   <VN node list> ::= <VN node> [<VN node list>]

   <VN link list> :: = <VN link>  [<VN link list>]



5.7. VN Member

   VN Member describes details of a VN Member which is a list of a set
   of VN Members represented as VN_Member_List.

   <VN_Member_List> ::= <VN Member> [<VN_Member_List>]



   Where <VN Member> ::= <Ingress VN End-Point>

                         [<VN Associated LSP>]

                         <Egress VN End-Point>

   Ingress VN End-Point is the VN End-Point information for the ingress
   portion of the AP. See Section 5.3 for VN End-Point details.

   Egress VN End-Point is the VN End-Point information for the egress
   portion of the AP. See Section 5.3 for VN End-Point details.

Internet-Draft              ACTN Info Model              June 2018


   VN Associated LSP describes the instantiated LSPs in the Provider's
   network for the VN Type 1. It describes the instantiated LSPs over
   the VN topology for VN Type 2.



5.7.1. VN Computed Path

   The VN Computed Path is the list of paths obtained after the VN path
   computation request from a higher controller. Note that the computed
   path is to be distinguished from the LSP. When the computed path is
   signaled in the network (and thus the resource is reserved for that
   path), it becomes an LSP.

   <VN Computed Path> ::= (<Path>...)

5.7.2. VN Service Preference

   This section provides VN Service preference. VN Service is defined
   in Section 2.

   <VN Service Preference> ::= [<Location Service Preference >]

                           [<Client-specific Preference >]

                           [<End-Point Dynamic Selection Preference >]



   Where

      Location Service Preference describes the End-Point Location's
      (e.g. Data Centers) support for certain Virtual Network Functions
      (VNFs) (e.g., security function, firewall capability, etc.) and
      is used to find the path that satisfies the VNF constraint.


      Client-specific Preference describes any preference related to
      Virtual Network Service (VNS) that application/client can enforce
      via CNC towards lower level controllers. For example, CNC can
      enforce client-specific preferences, e.g., selection of a
      destination data center from the set of candidate data centers
      based on some criteria in the context of VM migration. MSDC/PNC
      should then provide the data center interconnection that supports
      the client-specific preference.

Internet-Draft              ACTN Info Model              June 2018


      End-Point Dynamic Selection Preference describes if the End-Point
      (e.g. Data Center) can support load balancing, disaster recovery
      or VM migration and so can be part of the selection by MDSC
      following service Preference enforcement by CNC.

9. Security Considerations

   The ACTN information model is not directly relevant when considering
   potential security issues. Rather, it defines a set of interfaces
   for traffic engineered networks. The underlying protocols,
   procedures, and implementations used to exchange the information
   model described in this draft will need to secure the request and
   control of resources with proper authentication and authorization
   mechanisms. In addition, the data exchanged over the ACTN interfaces
   discussed in this document requires verification of data integrity.
   Backup or redundancies should also be available to restore the
   affected data to its correct state.

   Implementations of the ACTN framework will have distributed
   functional components that will exchange a concrete instantiation
   that adheres to this information model. Implementations should
   encrypt data that flows between them, especially when they are
   implemented at remote nodes and irrespective of whether these data
   flows are on external or internal network interfaces. The
   information model may contain customer, application and network data
   that for business or privacy reasons may be considered sensitive. It
   should be stored only in an encrypted data store.

   The ACTN security discussion is further split into two specific
   interfaces:

     - Interface between the Customer Network Controller and Multi
        Domain Service Coordinator (MDSC), CNC-MDSC Interface (CMI)

     - Interface between the Multi Domain Service Coordinator and
        Provisioning Network Controller (PNC), MDSC-PNC Interface (MPI)


   See the detailed discussion of the CMI and MPI in Sections 9.1 and
   9.2, respectively in [ACTN-Frame].

Internet-Draft              ACTN Info Model              June 2018


   The conclusion is that all data models and protocols used to realize
   the ACTN info model should have rich security features as discussed
   in this section. Additional security risks may still exist.
   Therefore, discussion and applicability of specific security
   functions and protocols will be better described in documents that
   are use case and environment specific.
