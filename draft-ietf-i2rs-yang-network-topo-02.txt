1.  Introduction

   This document introduces an abstract (base) YANG [RFC6020] [RFC6021]
   data model to represent networks and topologies.  The data model is
   divided into two parts.  The first part of the model defines a
   network model that allows to define network hierarchies (i.e. network
   stacks) and to maintain an inventory of nodes contained in a network.
   The second part of the model augments the basic network model with
   information to describe topology information.  Specifically, it adds
   the concepts of links and termination points to describe how nodes in
   a network are connected to each other.  Moreover the model introduces
   vertical layering relationships between networks that can be
   augmented to cover both network inventories and network/service
   topologies.

   While it would be possible to combine both parts into a single model,
   the separation facilitates integration of network topology and
   network inventory models, by allowing to augment network inventory
   information separately and without concern for topology into the
   network model.

   The model can be augmented to describe specifics of particular types
   of networks and topologies.  For example, an augmenting model can
   provide network node information with attributes that are specific to
   a particular network type.  Examples of augmenting models include
   models for Layer 2 network topologies, Layer 3 network topologies,
   such as Unicast IGP, IS-IS [RFC1195] and OSPF [RFC2328], traffic
   engineering (TE) data [RFC3209], or any of the variety of transport
   and service topologies.  Information specific to particular network
   types will be captured in separate, technology-specific models.

   The basic data models introduced in this document are generic in
   nature and can be applied to many network and service topologies and
   inventories.  The models allow applications to operate on an
   inventory or topology of any network at a generic level, where
   specifics of particular inventory/topology types are not required.
   At the same time, where data specific to a network type does comes
   into play and the model is augmented, the instantiated data still
   adheres to the same structure and is represented in consistent
   fashion.  This also facilitates the representation of network
   hierarchies and dependencies between different network components and
   network types.

   The abstract (base) network YANG module introduced in this document,
   entitled "network.yang", contains a list of abstract network nodes

   and defines the concept of network hierarchy (network stack).  The
   abstract network node can be augmented in inventory and topology
   models with inventory and topology specific attributes.  Network
   hierarchy (stack) allows any given network to have one or more
   "supporting networks".  The relationship of the base network model,
   the inventory models and the topology models is shown in the
   following figure (dotted lines in the figure denote possible
   augmentations to models defined in this document).

                   Figure 1: The network model structure

   The network-topology YANG module introduced in this document,
   entitled "network-topology.yang", defines a generic topology model at
   its most general level of abstraction.  The module defines a topology
   graph and components from which it is composed: nodes, edges and
   termination points.  Nodes (from the network.yang module) represent
   graph vertices and links represent graph edges.  Nodes also contain
   termination points that anchor the links.  A network can contain
   multiple topologies, for example topologies at different layers and
   overlay topologies.  The model therefore allows to capture
   relationships between topologies, as well as dependencies between
   nodes and termination points across topologies.  An example of a
   topology stack is shown in the following figure.

               Figure 2: Topology hierarchy (stack) example

   The figure shows three topology levels.  At top, the "Service"
   topology shows relationships between service entities, such as
   service functions in a service chain.  The "L3" topology shows
   network elements at Layer 3 (IP) and the "Optical" topology shows
   network elements at Layer 1.  Service functions in the "Service"
   topology are mapped onto network elements in the "L3" topology, which
   in turn are mapped onto network elements in the "Optical" topology.
   The figure shows two Service Functions - X1 and X2 - mapping onto a
   single L3 network element; this could happen, for example, if two
   service functions reside in the same VM (or server) and share the
   same set of network interfaces.  The figure shows a single "L3"
   network element mapped onto multiple "Optical" network elements.
   This could happen, for example, if a single IP router attaches to
   multiple ROADMs in the optical domain.

   Another example of a service topology stack is shown in the following
   figure.

                                  L3 Topology

               Figure 3: Topology hierarchy (stack) example

   The figure shows two VPN service topologies (VPN1 and VPN2)
   instantiated over a common L3 topology.  Each VPN service topology is
   mapped onto a subset of nodes from the common L3 topology.

   There are multiple applications for such a data model.  For example,
   within the context of I2RS, nodes within the network can use the data
   model to capture their understanding of the overall network topology
   and expose it to a network controller.  A network controller can then
   use the instantiated topology data to compare and reconcile its own
   view of the network topology with that of the network elements that
   it controls.  Alternatively, nodes within the network could propagate
   this understanding to compare and reconcile this understanding either
   among themselves or with help of a controller.  Beyond the network
   element and the immediate context of I2RS itself, a network
   controller might even use the data model to represent its view of the
   topology that it controls and expose it to applications north of
   itself.  Further use cases that the data model can be applied to are
   described in [topology-use-cases].

       Figure 4: The structure of the abstract (base) network model

   The model contains a container with a list of networks, and a
   container with a list of network state.

   Container "networks" contains a list of networks.  Each network is
   captured in its own list entry, distinguished via a network-id.

   A network has a certain type, such as L2, L3, OSPF or IS-IS.  A
   network can even have multiple types simultaneously.  The type, or
   types, are captured underneath the container "network-types".  In
   this module it serves merely as an augmentation target; network-
   specific modules will later introduce new data nodes to represent new
   network types below this target, i.e. insert them below "network-
   types" by ways of yang augmentation.

   When a network is of a certain type, it will contain a corresponding
   data node.  Network types SHOULD always be represented using presence
   containers, not leafs of empty type.  This allows to represent
   hierarchies of network subtypes within the instance information.  For
   example, an instance of an OSPF network (which, at the same time, is
   a layer 3 unicast IGP network) would contain underneath "network-
   types" another container "l3-unicast-igp-network", which in turn
   would contain a container "ospf-network".

   A network can in turn be part of a hierarchy of networks, building on
   top of other networks.  Any such networks are captured in the list
   "supporting-network".  A supporting network is in effect an underlay
   network.

   Furthermore, a network contains an inventory of nodes that are part
   of the network.  The nodes of a network are captured in their own
   list.  Each node is identified relative to its containing network by
   a node-id.

   It should be noted that a node does not exist independently of a
   network; instead it is a part of the network that it is contained in.
   In cases where the same entity takes part in multiple networks, or at
   multiple layers of a networking stack, the same entity will be
   represented by multiple nodes, one for each network.  In other words,
   the node represents an abstraction of the device for the particular
   network that it a is part of.  To represent that the same entity or
   same device is part of multiple topologies or networks, it is
   possible to create one "physical" network with a list of nodes for
   each of the devices or entities.  This (physical) network,
   respectively the (entities) nodes in that network, can then be
   referred to as underlay network and nodes from the other (logical)
   networks and nodes, respectively.  Note that the model allows to
   define more than one underlay network (and node), allowing for
   simultaneous representation of layered network- and service
   topologies and physical instantiation.

   Similar to a network, a node can be supported by other nodes, and map
   onto one or more other nodes in an underlay network.  This is
   captured in the list "supporting-node".  The resulting hierarchy of
   nodes allows also to represent device stacks, where a node at one
   level is supported by a set of nodes at an underlying level.  For
   example, a "router" node might be supported by a node representing a
   route processor and separate nodes for various line cards and service
   modules, a virtual router might be supported or hosted on a physical
   device represented by a separate node, and so on.

   Container "networks-state" contains data about the network state.  It
   contains a list of networks, mirroring the corresponding list under
   the "networks" container and containing in each data node state
   information for the corresponding network.  Currently, each list
   element contains a single state, "server-provided".  This state
   indicates how the network came into being.  If false, the network was
   configured by a client application, for example in the case of an
   overlay network that is configured by a controller application.  If
   true, the network was populated by the server itself, respectively an
   application on the server that is able to discover the network.

   Network data can come into being in one of two ways.  In one way,
   network data is configured by client applications, for example in
   case of overlay networks that are configured by an SDN Controller
   application.  In annother way, it is populated by the server, in case
   of networks that can be discovered.  Client applications SHOULD NOT

   modify configurations of networks for which "server-provided" is
   true.  (Please note this is an open issue for further discussion, see
   section Section 3.5.)

3.2.  Base Network Topology Model

   The abstract (base) network topology model is defined in the
   "network-topology.yang" module.  It builds on the network model
   defined in the "network.yang" module, augmenting it with links
   (defining how nodes are connected) and termination-points (which
   anchor the links and are contained in nodes).  The structure of the
   network topology module is shown in the following figure.  Brackets
   enclose list keys, "rw" means configuration data, "ro" means
   operational state data, and "?" designates optional nodes.  A "+"
   indicates a line break.

   A node has a list of termination points that are used to terminate
   links.  An example of a termination point might be a physical or
   logical port or, more generally, an interface.

   Like a node, a termination point can in turn be supported by an
   underlying termination point, contained in the supporting node of the
   underlay network.

   A link is identified by a link-id that uniquely identifies the link
   within a given topology.  Links are point-to-point and
   unidirectional.  Accordingly, a link contains a source and a
   destination.  Both source and destination reference a corresponding
   node, as well as a termination point on that node.  Similar to a
   node, a link can map onto one or more links in an underlay topology
   (which are terminated by the corresponding underlay termination
   points).  This is captured in the list "supporting-link".

3.3.  Extending the model

   In order to derive a model for a specific type of network, the base
   model can be extended.  This can be done roughly as follows: for the
   new network type, a new YANG module is introduced.  In this module a
   number of augmentations are defined against the network and network-
   topology YANG modules.

   We start with augmentations against the network.yang module.  First,
   a new network type needs to be defined.  For this, a presence
   container that resembles the new network type is defined.  It is
   inserted by means of augmentation below the network-types container.
   Subsequently, data nodes for any network-type specific node
   parameters are defined and augmented into the node list.  The new
   data nodes can be defined as conditional ("when") on the presence of
   the corresponding network type in the containing network.  In cases
   where there are any requirements or restrictions in terms of network
   hierarchies, such as when a network of a new network-type requires a
   specific type of underlay network, it is possible to define
   corresponding constraints as well and augment the supporting-network
   list accordingly.  However, care should be taken to avoid excessive
   definitions of constraints.

   Subsequently, augmentations are defined against network-
   topology.yang.  Data nodes are defined both for link parameters, as
   well as termination point parameters, that are specific to the new
   network type.  Those data nodes are inserted by way of augmentation
   into the link and termination-point lists, respectively.  Again, data
   nodes can be defined as conditional on the presence of the
   corresponding network-type in the containing network, by adding a
   corresponding "when"-statement.

   It is possible, but not required, to group data nodes for a given
   network-type under a dedicated container.  Doing so introduces
   further structure, but lengthens data node path names.

   In cases where a hierarchy of network types is defined, augmentations
   can in turn against augmenting modules, with the module of a network
   "sub-type" augmenting the module of a network "super-type".

3.4.  Discussion and selected design decisions

3.4.1.  Container structure

   Rather than maintaining lists in separate containers, the model is
   kept relatively flat in terms of its containment structure.  Lists of
   nodes, links, termination-points, and supporting-nodes, supporting-
   links, and supporting-termination-points are not kept in separate
   containers.  Therefore, path specifiers used to refer to specific
   nodes, be it in management operations or in specifications of
   constraints, can remain relatively compact.  Of course, this means
   there is no separate structure in instance information that separates
   elements of different lists from one another.  Such structure is
   semantically not required, although it might enhance human
   readability in some cases.

3.4.2.  Underlay hierarchies and mappings

   To minimize assumptions of what a particular entity might actually
   represent, mappings between networks, nodes, links, and termination
   points are kept strictly generic.  For example, no assumptions are
   made whether a termination point actually refers to an interface, or
   whether a node refers to a specific "system" or device; the model at
   this generic level makes no provisions for that.

   Where additional specifics about mappings between upper and lower
   layers are required, those can be captured in augmenting modules.
   For example, to express that a termination point in a particular
   network type maps to an interface, an augmenting module can introduce
   an augmentation to the termination point which introduces a leaf of
   type ifref that references the corresponding interface [RFC7223].
   Similarly, if a node maps to a particular device or network element,
   an augmenting module can augment the node data with a leaf that
   references the network element.

   It is possible for links at one level of a hierarchy to map to
   multiple links at another level of the hierarchy.  For example, a VPN
   topology might model VPN tunnels as links.  Where a VPN tunnel maps
   to a path that is composed of a chain of several links, the link will
   contain a list of those supporting links.  Likewise, it is possible



Clemm, et al.             Expires June 10, 2016                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft  draft-ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo-02.txt   December 2015


   for a link at one level of a hierarchy to aggregate a bundle of links
   at another level of the hierarchy.

3.4.3.  Dealing with changes in underlay networks

   It is possible for a network to undergo churn even as other networks
   are layered on top of it.  When a supporting node, link, or
   termination point is deleted, the supporting leafrefs in the overlay
   will be left dangling.  To allow for this possibility, the model
   makes use of the "require-instance" construct of YANG 1.1
   [I.D.draft-ietf-netmod-rfc6020bis].

   It is the responsibility of the application maintaining the overlay
   to deal with the possibility of churn in the underlay network.  When
   a server receives a request to configure an overlay network, it
   SHOULD validate whether supporting nodes/links/tps refer to nodes in
   the underlay are actually in existence.  Configuration requests in
   which supporting nodes/links/tps refer to objects currently not in
   existence SHOULD be rejected.  It is the responsibility of the
   application to update the overlay when a supporting node/link/tp is
   deleted at a later point in time.  For this purpose, an application
   might subscribe to updates when changes to the underlay occur, for
   example using mechanisms defined in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-yang-push].

3.4.4.  Use of groupings

   The model makes use of groupings, instead of simply defining data
   nodes "in-line".  This allows to more easily include the
   corresponding data nodes in notifications, which then do not need to
   respecify each data node that is to be included.  The tradeoff for
   this is that it makes the specification of constraints more complex,
   because constraints involving data nodes outside the grouping need to
   be specified in conjunction with a "uses" statement where the
   grouping is applied.  This also means that constraints and XPath-
   statements need to specified in such a way that they navigate "down"
   first and select entire sets of nodes, as opposed to being able to
   simply specify them against individual data nodes.

3.4.5.  Cardinality and directionality of links

   The topology model includes links that are point-to-point and
   unidirectional.  It does not directly support multipoint and
   bidirectional links.  While this may appear as a limitation, it does
   keep the model simple, generic, and allows it to very easily be
   subjected to applications that make use of graph algorithms.  Bi-
   directional connections can be represented through pairs of
   unidirectional links.  Multipoint networks can be represented through

Internet-Draft  draft-ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo-02.txt   December 2015


   pseudo-nodes (similar to IS-IS, for example).  By introducing
   hierarchies of nodes, with nodes at one level mapping onto a set of
   other nodes at another level, and introducing new links for nodes at
   that level, topologies with connections representing non-point-to-
   point communication patterns can be represented.

3.4.6.  Multihoming and link aggregation

   Links are terminated by a single termination point, not sets of
   termination points.  Connections involving multihoming or link
   aggregation schemes need to be represented using multiple point-to-
   point links, then defining a link at a higher layer that is supported
   by those individual links.

3.4.7.  Mapping redundancy

   In a hierarchy of networks, there are nodes mapping to nodes, links
   mapping to links, and termination points mapping to termination
   points.  Some of this information is redundant.  Specifically, if the
   link-to-links mapping known, and the termination points of each link
   known, termination point mapping information can be derived via
   transitive closure and does not have to be explicitly configured.
   Nonetheless, in order to not constrain applications regarding which
   mappings they want to configure and which should be derived, the
   model does provide for the option to configure this information
   explicitly.  The model includes integrity constraints to allow for
   validating for consistency.

3.4.8.  Typing

   A network's network types are represented using a container which
   contains a data node for each of its network types.  A network can
   encompass several types of network simultaneously, hence a container
   is used instead of a case construct, with each network type in turn
   represented by a dedicated presence container itself.  The reason for
   not simply using an empty leaf, or even simpler, do away even with
   the network container and just use a leaf-list of network-type
   instead, is to be able to represent "class hierarchies" of network
   types, with one network type refining the other.  Network-type
   specific containers are to be defined in the network-specific
   modules, augmenting the network-types container.

3.4.9.  Representing the same device in multiple networks

   One common requirement concerns the ability to represent that the
   same device can be part of multiple networks and topologies.
   However, the model defines a node as relative to the network that it
   is contained in.  The same node cannot be part of multiple

   topologies.  In many cases, a node will be the abstraction of a
   particular device in a network.  To reflect that the same device is
   part of multiple topologies, the following approach might be chosen:
   A new type of network to represent a "physical" (or "device") network
   is introduced, with nodes representing devices.  This network forms
   an underlay network for logical networks above it, with nodes of the
   logical network mapping onto nodes in the physical network.

   This scenario is depicted in the following figure.  It depicts three
   networks with two nodes each.  A physical network P consists of an
   inventory of two nodes, D1 and D2, each representing a device.  A
   second network, X, has a third network, Y, as its underlay.  Both X
   and Y also have the physical network P as underlay.  X1 has both Y1
   and D1 as underlay nodes, while Y1 has D1 as underlay node.
   Likewise, X2 has both Y2 and D2 as underlay nodes, while Y2 has D2 as
   underlay node.  The fact that X1 and Y1 are both instantiated on the
   same physical node D1 can be easily derived.

         Figure 6: Topology hierarchy example - multiple underlays

   In the case of a physical network, nodes represent physical devices
   and termination points physical ports.  It should be noted that it is
   also conceivable to augment the model for a physical network-type,
   defining augmentations that have nodes reference system information
   and termination points reference physical interfaces, in order to
   provide a bridge between network and device models.

3.5.  Open Issues

3.5.1.  Supporting client as well as server provided network topology

   YANG requires data needs to be designated as either configuration or
   operational data, but not both, yet it is important to have all
   network information, including vertical cross-network dependencies,
   captured in one coherent model.  In most cases network topology
   information is discovered about a network; the topology is considered
   a property of the network that is reflected in the model.  That said,
   it is conceivable that certain types of topology need to also be
   configurable by an application.

   There are several alternatives in which this can be addressed.  The
   alternative chosen in this draft does not restrict network topology
   information as read-only, but includes a state that indicates for
   each network whether it is populated by the server or by a client
   application.  (The drawback of this solution is that it stretches its
   use of the configuration concept.  Configuration information is
   subject to backup and restore, which is not applicable to server-
   provided information.  Perhaps more serious is the ability of a
   client to lock a configuration and thus prevent changes to server-
   provided network topology while the lock is in effect.  Preventing
   this requires special treatment of network topology related
   configuration information.)

   In another alternative, all information about network topology that
   is in effect is represented as network state, i.e. as read-only
   information, regardless of how it came into being.  For cases where
   network topology needs to be configured, a second branch for
   configurable topology information is introduced.  Any network
   topology configuration is mirrored by network state information.  A
   configurable network will thus be represented twice: once in the
   read-only list of all networks, a second time in a configuration
   sandbox.  (The drawback of this solution is slightly increased
   complexity of augmentations due to two target branches.

3.5.2.  Identifiers of string or URI type

   The current model defines identifiers of nodes, networks, links, and
   termination points as URIs.  An alternative would define them as
   string.

   The case for strings is that they will be easier to implement.  The
   reason for choosing URIs is that the topology/node/tp exists in a
   larger context, hence it is useful to be able to correlate
   identifiers across systems.  While strings, being the universal data
   type, are easier for human beings (a string is a string is a string),
   they also muddle things.  What typically happens is that strings have
   some structure which is magically assigned and the knowledge of this



Clemm, et al.             Expires June 10, 2016                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft  draft-ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo-02.txt   December 2015


   structure has to be communicated to each system working with the
   data.  A URI makes the structure explicit and also attaches
   additional semantics: the URI, unlike a free-form string, can be fed
   into a URI resolver, which can point to additional resources
   associated with the URI.  This property is important when the
   topology data is integrated into a larger, more complex system.

5.  Security Considerations

   The transport protocol used for sending the topology data MUST
   support authentication and SHOULD support encryption.  The data-model
   by itself does not create any security implications.
