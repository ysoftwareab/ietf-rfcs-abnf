              Additional Data related to an Emergency Call
                draft-ietf-ecrit-additional-data-00.txt

Abstract

   When an emergency call is sent to a PSAP, the device that sends it,
   as well as any service provider in the path of the call may have
   information about the call which the PSAP may be able to use.  This
   document describes an XML data structure that contains this kind of
   information in a standardized form.  A URI that points to the
   structure can be included in the SIP signaling with the call.

Internet-Draft             Additional Data URI            September 2010


1.  Introduction

   When an emergency call is sent to a PSAP, there is a rich set of data
   in the headers with the call, but the device, as well as any other
   service provider in the path may have even more information that
   would be useful to a PSAP.  This information may include the identity
   and contact information of the service provider, subscriber identity
   and contact information, the type of service the service provider
   provides, what kind of device the user has, etc.  Some kinds of
   devices or services have device or service dependent data.  For
   example, a car telematics system or service may have crash
   information.  A medical monitoring device may have sensor data.
   While the details of the information may vary by device or service,
   there needs to be a common way to send such data to a PSAP.

   For the call takers this will enable more intelligent decision making
   and therefore better response in case of an emergency.  A pre-
   requisite is to offer the technical capabilities to let call takers
   to gain access to this information stored elsewhere (granted that
   they have authorization to access it).

   This document focuses on the data that can be obtained about a call
   and an existing SIP header field, the Call-Info header, is used for
   this purpose by defining a new token, namely 'emergencyCallData'
   carried in the "purpose" parameter.  If the "purpose" parameter set
   to 'emergencyCallData' then the Call-Info contains a HTTPS URL that
   points to an XML data structure with information about the call.  The
   initial XML data structure was defined by a working group within the
   National Emergency Number Association (NENA) and is included in this
   document.

   The data structure contains an element which itself is a URI that has
   device or service dependent data.  Thus the common Additional Data
   about a Call defined by this document contains a 'hook', in the form
   of a URI for a device or service dependent data structure.

3.  Additional Data about a Call

   The Additional Data about a Call is information specific to a call
   known by the device that sends it or a service provider in the path
   of a call.  The Additional Data about a Call is an XML data
   structure.  An HTTPS URI to that structure may be inserted in a SIP
   INVITE or MESSAGE transaction with a Call-Info header containing a
   purpose of "emergenyCallData".  The data, which must conform to the
   schema in Section 4 may be retrieved with an HTTPS Get. HTTPS MUST be
   used.

   More than one Call-Info header with an emergencyCallData purpose can
   be expected.  The device may insert one, and any intermediary service
   provider may insert its own.  When there are multiple intermediaries
   each intermediary may each insert one.  For example, a device may
   provide one, a telematics service provider may provide one and the
   mobile carrier handling the call may provide one.

3.1.  Data Provided by

   Data Element:  Data Provided by


   Use:  Required


   XML Element:  <DataProvidedBy>


   Description:  This is a plain language string suitable for displaying
      the name of the service provider that created the additional data
      structure.  If the device created the structure the value is
      identical to the contact header in the SIP Invite.  This data is
      required and should reflect the contact information of the owner
      of the device.


   Reason for Need:  Inform the call taker about the identity of the
      entity providing the additional call data structure.

   How Used by Call Taker:  Allows the call taker to interpret the data
      in this structure.  The source of the information often influences
      how the information is used, believed or verified.

      Additional information may be found at
      http://www.nena.org/nena-company-id.  The NENA Company ID shall be
      in the form of any URI for example: urn:nena:companyid:<NENA
      Company ID>.  This data is required unless the additional data
      structure is provided by the device.


   Reason for Need:  Inform the call taker about the identity of the
      entity providing the additional call data structure.


   How Used by Call Taker:  Where jurisdictions have lists of providers
      the Provider Company ID can lead to a wealth of information
      associated with the code.

3.3.  Provided by Contact URI

   Data Element:  Provided by Contact URI


   Use:  Required


   XML Element:  <ContractURI>


   Description:  For a Service Provider the contact should be a 24x7
      contact number.  If provided by an entity without a 24X7, they
      must provide the provided by contact information.  This must be a
      SIP URI.  If a telephone number is the contact address it should
      be provided in the form of
      sip:telephonenumber@serviceprovider:user=phone.  If the call is
      from a device, this data is required and should reflect the
      contact information of the owner of the device.

3.8.  Device Classification

   Data Element:  Device Classification


   Use:  Optional


   XML Element:  <DeviceClassification>


   Description:  If the device provides the data structure, the device
      information should be provided.  If the Service Provider provides
      the structure and it knows what the device is, the Service
      Provider should provide the device information.  Often the carrier
      does not know what the device is.  It is possible to receive 2
      data structures, one created by the device and one created by the
      Service Provider.  Information about the device, not how it is
      being used.  This data element defines the kind of device making
      the emergency call.  A registry will reflect the following valid
      entries:

      *  Cordless handset

      *  Fixed phone

      *  Video phone

      *  Other text device

      *  Not Available


   Reason for Need:  The device classification describes the capability
      of the calling device.  For example, does the device require human
      intervention to initiate a call or is this call the result of
      programmed instructions.  Does the calling device have the ability
      to rebid for location or condition changes?  Is this device
      interactive or a one-way reporting device?


   How Used by Call Taker:  May assist with location of caller.  For
      example, a cordless handset may be outside or next door.  May
      provide calltaker some context about the caller.

   XML Element:  <DeviceMfgr>


   Description:  Manufacturer is electronically stored on the device.
      Different devices may use different conventions to provide their
      information.  We need to know what it represents, so a registry is
      in order.  Need to be able to standardize as much as possible with
      a uniform naming convention.  A registry will reflect the valid
      entries.


   Reason for Need:  Used by PSAP management for post-mortem
      investigation/resolution.

   Description:  Characters that identify the specific device making the
      call or creating an event.


   Reason for Need:  May be needed when trying to obtain a subpoena to
      obtain customer information in instances where location info did
      not display or someone is making false emergency calls.  May also
      be used when working with safe houses that are using non-
      initialized phones.


   How Used by Call Taker:  Probably not used by calltaker they would
      need to refer to management for investigation.

3.12.  Type of Device Identifier

   Data Element:  Type of Device Identifier


   Use:  Optional


   XML Element:  <TypeOfDeviceID>


   Description:  Identifies the type of device identifier being
      generated in the unique device identifier data element.  A
      registry will reflect the following valid entries:

      *  Sensors (types to be identified in a future document version)

      *  Manufacturer Serial Number


   Reason for Need:  Calls from uninitiated devices would give an
      identifier that could be associated with erroneous calls --- use
      the number to identify what type of capabilities there are.  Could
      also use this information to block specific types of calls.


   How Used by Call Taker:  Additional information that may be used to
      assist with call handling.

3.13.  Device/service specific additional data structure

   Data Element:  Device/service specific additional data structure


   Use:  Optional


   XML Element:  <devicespecificSchema>


   Description:  A URI representing additional data whose schema is
      specific to the device or service which created it.  An example is
      the VEDs structure for a vehicle telematics device.  The structure
      can be referenced via URI and used in the policy routing function
      business rules/policies or for access by call takers or
      responders.  Non-NENA XML schemas must be registered.  Some
      possible sources are:

      *  NPAC

      *  Hazmat International Association of Fire Chiefs

      *  DHS/EPA E-Plan for HazMat

      *  NFPA - National Fire Protection Association

      *  National Alliance for Public Safety GIS (NA-PSG)

      *  US DOT Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration
         (PHMSA) examples of additional data.

      *  IEEE 1512 - USDOT Model for traffic incidents

      *  Smart Building (NIST)

      *  VEDS

      Different data may be created by each classification; i.e.,
      telematics creates VEDS data set - can be different types of data
      depending on device.  May want to describe type of data for each
      device.


   Reason for Need:  This data element will allow for identification of
      externally defined schemas, which may have additional data that
      will assist in emergency response.


   How Used by Call Taker:  This data element will allow the end user
      (calltaker or first responder) to know what type of additional
      data may be available to aid in providing the needed emergency
      services.

3.14.  Telephone Number Privacy Indicator

   Data Element:  Telephone Number Privacy Indicator


   Use:  Required


   XML Element:  <TNPrivacyIndicator>


   Description:  Some State regulations require that Non-Published
      subscriber name remains private to all including 9-1-1.  Where
      this regulation is in place, the end user's name must be overlaid
      with blanks or the verbiage, "Non-Published Number."


   Reason for Need:  Some State regulations require that Non-Published
      subscriber name remains private to all including emergency calls.
      Where this regulation is in place, the end user's name must be
      overlaid with blanks or the verbiage, "Non-Published Number".

   How Used by Call Taker:  This is not beneficial to PSAPs; however,
      they must follow state regulations.  This indicator will allow for
      coding that overlays the non-published subscriber name with the
      verbiage "Non-Published Number."

3.15.  vCARD for Subscriber's Data

   Data Element:  vCARD for Subscriber's Data


   Use:  Required


   XML Element:  <SubscriberData>


   Description:  Information known by the Service Provider about the
      subscriber; i.e., Name, Address, Calling Party Number, Main
      Telephone Number and any other data.  If the subscriber is an
      enterprise, this is the vCARD of the enterprise and the Company
      Name is used not the Name of the Caller.  The telephone number is
      the main telephone number at the location of the call.  The
      address should be where the call is originating from.


   Reason for Need:  Critical information required for proper call
      handling and dispatching.


   How Used by Call Taker:  Critical information required for proper
      call handling and dispatching.

5.  Security Considerations

   The information in this data structure will usually be considered
   private.  HTTPS is specified to require the provider of the
   information to validate the credentials of the requester.  While the
   creation of a PKI that has global scope may be difficult, the
   alternatives to creating devices and services that can provide
   critical information securely are more daunting.

   The Call-info header with purpose='emergencyCallData' MUST only be
   sent on an emergency call, which can be ascertained by the presence
   of an emergency service urn in a Route header of a SIP message.

   <how recipient validates credentials of sender>

   <how sender validates credentials of recipient>

   <how sender validates credentials of anyone requesting device
   dependent data>

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  'emergencyCallData' Purpose Parameter Value

   This document defines the 'emergencyCallData' value for the "purpose"
   parameter of the Call-Info header field.  A reference to this RFC (in
   double brackets) has been added to the existing "purpose" Call-Info
   parameter entry in the SIP Parameters registry, which currently looks
   as follows:


                                       Predefined
      Header Field    Parameter Name     Values     Reference
      -------------   --------------   ---------   ---------
      Call-Info         purpose           Yes      [RFC3261][RFC5367]
