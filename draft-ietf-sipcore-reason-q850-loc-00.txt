     ISUP Cause Location Parameter for the SIP Reason Header Field
               draft-ietf-sipcore-reason-q850-loc-00.txt

Abstract

   The SIP Reason header field is defined for carrying ISUP cause values
   as well as SIP response codes.  Some services in SIP networks may
   need to know the ISUP location where the call was released in the
   PSTN network to correctly interpret the reason of release.

1.  Introduction

   The SIP Reason header field specification [RFC3326] describes a SIP
   header field that is used to indicate that a SIP request is carrying
   the reason of release.  It may be an SIP response or ISUP release
   cause as specified within [Q.850].  [RFC3326] does specify that a
   ISUP [Q.850] cause code can be carried within a SIP response.  The
   [Q.850] location information identifies the part of the ISUP network
   where the call was released.

   This document adds a location value parameter to the reason-extension
   parameter in [RFC3326] so that the [Q.850] location value can be
   interworked from the PSTN.  The interworking from PTSN needs only to
   include the location received by the interworking gateway.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Rationale

   The primary intent of the parameter defined in this specification is
   for use in IMS networks defined by 3GPP but also open to be used by
   any other network.  The purpose of this parameter is to transport the
   location of call release from the originating PSTN entity to the SIP
   entity receiving the response or BYE message containing the location
   of the call release.  The ISDN location is defined in [Q.850].

Internet-Draft       ISUP Release Location Parameter            May 2017


4.  Mechanism

   As defined by [RFC3326] a Reason header field MAY appear in any
   request in a dialog, in any CANCEL request and in any response whose
   status code explicitly allows the presence of this header field.  The
   syntax of the header field follows the standard SIP parameter syntax.

   The mechanism employed adds a parameter with the ISUP location value
   defined in [Q.850] to the Reason header field that identifies the
   [Q.850] location of the call release in ISUP as defined in [Q.850] .
   The Augmented BNF (ABNF) [RFC5234] for this parameter is shown in
   Figure 1.

   reason-extension =/ isup-cause-location
   isup-cause-location =  "location" EQUAL string

   The following values shall be used as location:
   U    for user
   LPN  for private network serving the local user
   LN   for public network serving the local user
   TN        for transit network
   RLN  for public network serving the remote user
   RPN  for private network serving the remote user
   INTL for international network
   BI   for network beyond interworking point

                       Figure 1: isup-cause-location

   Note: These are the values defined within [Q.850] as location.  Thus
   other values are not within the scope of this document.

   Depending on the direction the UAC or UAS shall include the isup-
   cause-location when setting up the Reason header field with a [Q.850]
   cause.  This approach is only valid in cases when the ISUP [Q.850]
   location is available.

5.  Example

   The following example shows a SIP 404 response message containing a
   Reason header field with a [Q.850] cause value and a isup-cause-
   location value.  The 404 Response will be set up when a gateway
   receives an ISUP Release with a [Q.850] cause set to 1 meaning
   "Unallocated (unassigned) number", i.e. the number is not known in
   the PSTN.

6.  Privacy Considerations

   This document doesn't change any of the privacy considerations
   described in [RFC3326].  While the addition of the isup-cause-
   location parameter does provide an indicator of the entity that added
   the location in the signaling path this provides little more exposure
   than the [Q.850] cause itself.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document doesn't change any of the security considerations
   described in [RFC3326].  The addition of the isup-cause-location
   parameter does provide an indicator of the [Q.850] location where the
   call was released within the PSTN.  This information may be used for
   specific location driven services but does not create any additional
   security constrains.  But since the [Q.850] location is very
   imprecise the [Q.850] location value itself will not add any major
   security constrain.  The use of this parameter is not restricted to a
   specific architecture.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  Registration of isup-cause-location Parameter for reason header
      field

   This document calls for IANA to register a new SIP header parameter
   as per the guidelines in [RFC3261], which will be added to header
   sub-registry under http://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters.

   Header Field:  Reason

   Parameter Name:  isup-cause-location
