Internet-Draft   Generalized Ethernet Pseudowire   July 2008 
 
  Abstract 
 
This draft proposes a simpler approach to handling various 
encapsulations of Ethernet packets over a pseudowire, over the 
existing Ethernet Pseudowire definition in [RFC4448]. 
 
Conventions used in this document 
 
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 
 
 
1. Introduction 

In this draft, we describe a methodology for encapsulating Ethernet 
packets in pseudowires that eliminates the need for multiple 
encapsulation formats and pseudowire code-points when Ethernet 
formats change.  This draft extends the concepts already published 
in [RFC4448]. 
  
[RFC4448] defines two different pseudowire types for Ethernet 
packets, one where the packet transported over the pseudowire must 
have a service delimiting VLAN tag (Ethernet tagged type), and the 
other where it does not need to have one (Ethernet type) as per 
[IANA PWE3]. The original justification for the tagged PW type came 
from the need to accommodate routers that could not handle standard 
Ethernet functions like imposing, stripping or rewriting VLAN tags.  
 
This draft has been written in response to the following statements 
from [RFC4448] and consequent concerns that as new Ethernet formats 
(such as Provider Backbone Bridging, PBB I-tag [802.1ah]) are 
defined, corresponding pseudowires have to be defined: 
 
  - For an Ethernet VLAN PW, VLAN tag rewrite can be achieved by 
     NSP at the egress PE, which is outside the scope of this 
     document ([RFC4448], Section 3). 
      
  - The Ethernet or Ethernet VLAN PW only supports homogeneous 
     Ethernet frame type across the PW; both ends of the PW must be 
     either tagged or untagged.  Heterogeneous frame type support 
     achieved with NSP functionality is outside the scope of this 
     document ([RFC4448], Section 3). 
 
This document proposes a Generic Ethernet PW (GE-PW) that extends 
the definition of Ethernet PWs and their usage in the existing 
L2VPNs (VPWS, VPLS) and simplifies the development of future 
solutions that require transport of Ethernet frames over a 
pseudowire.

2. The Generalized Ethernet Pseudowire 

To define the Generalized Ethernet Pseudowire (GE-PW) we need to 
describe the following functions: 
 
  - the packets eligible to be placed in a GE-PW 
  - the processing functions outside the scope of the GE-PW 
  - the processing functions within the scope of the GE-PW 
 
2.1. Eligible Packets in the GE-PW 

Any ethernet packet defined by the IEEE is an eligible packet for 
the GE-PW, regardless of the type of tags it contains - e.g. IEEE 
802.1Q, 802.1ad, 802.1ah tags. The Ethernet header is defined with a 
set of well defined code points that can be used by the NSP to 
identify the type of tag and the following header fields and to 
process the frame accordingly.  
 
A new Interface Parameter sub-TLV is defined to describe the 
capabilities of the NSP function to adapt different ethernet 
encapsulations as packets arrive from the pseudowire and are 
delivered to the attachment circuit. Section 4 describes the 
applicability and the format for the new sub-TLV. 
 
2.2. Processing outside the scope of the GE-PW 

When an ethernet packet is received on an attachment circuit (AC), 
it may be processed before being passed to the PW termination 
function.  This processing is done by the NSP function which has the 
responsibility of removing service delimiting encapsulations on the 
packet, and identifying the PW that the packet is bound for. 
 
When a packet arrives on a PW, the PW service label is used to 
identify the particular service instance and subsequently the NSP 
function that is applied to the ethernet packet at the egress PE.  
The NSP function puts on the appropriate ethernet encapsulation 
before passing the packet on to the attachment circuit(s) associated 
with the NSP. 
 
The processing of the Ethernet frames at the ingress and egress NSPs 
are outside the scope of the GE-PW. 
 
2.3. Processing within the scope of the GE-PW 

A packet passed to the PW termination function by the ingress NSP at 
the ingress PE is encapsulated with the appropriate PW label and is 
passed to the PSN function for encapsulation and transport to the

Internet-Draft   Generalized Ethernet Pseudowire   July 2008 
 
egress PE. A packet arriving on a pseudowire egress has its PW label 
popped, and the resulting packet is passed to the appropriate NSP 
instance. 
 
 
3. Detailed processing steps 

There are four main processing points in using a pseudowire: the 
ingress NSP function, the ingress PW termination function, the 
egress PW termination function, and the egress NSP function. 
 
Although just the PW termination functions are relevant for GE-PW, 
this section discusses how the GE-PW can be used with different 
types of existing NSPs to emulate existing and future services. 
 
In order to more clearly illustrate how a GE-PW may be used to 
provide pseudowire services, we introduce the following terms.  
These terms are to be used as a guideline to understanding the 
behavior of a GE-PW, and in no way define an implementation: 
 
  - In-NSP(packet, options): the ingress NSP function, includes the 
     ingress attachment circuit (AC) function 
  - In-PW(packet, options): the ingress PW termination function 
  - Out-PW(packet, options): the egress PW termination function 
  - Out-NSP(packet, options): the egress NSP function, includes the 
     egress AC function 
 
In addition, we define the pseudowire context (PWC) as the construct 
which has, at ingress, the following information: 
 
  - the incoming encapsulation of the packet 
  - the In-NSP function to be applied on the packet 
  - the In-PW termination function to be applied  
  - the ingress PSN encapsulation information to be applied 
 
and at egress: 
 
  - the Out-PW termination function to be applied  
  - the Out-NSP function to be applied on the packet 
  - the outgoing encapsulation of the packet on the attachment 
     circuit 
 
Using the above functions, we will define actions at the various 
stages of the packet through the network that affect its behavior.  
In particular, we will show the capabilities in describing the two 
existing Ethernet pseudowires, and introduction of a number of 
standard VLL service types that are enabled as a consequence of 
implementing the GE-PW methods.

As the packet arrives from the customer, at the In-NSP function, the 
NSP may remove the FCS and any extraneous packet header information 
that is locally significant [RFC4448]. The optional method described 
in [RFC4720] can be used to achieve payload integrity transparency. 
In particular, the function of the In-NSP is to render the packet 
ready for consumption by the remote Out-NSP function.  In other 
words, the In-NSP must replace, remove or impose VLAN tags, PBB I-
tag or any required Ethernet headers so that the packet is 
recognizable by the egress NSP.  It performs also functions specific 
to the type of native service that is rendered at the ingress PE, 
for example MAC switching, MAC learning, packet replication for 
VPLS. Finally, the In-NSP function also identifies the pseudowire 
that is associated with the attachment circuit over which the packet 
arrived.  If, for example, the packet arrived on a VLAN tagged port, 
and the VLAN tag identifies the attachment circuit, then the In-NSP 
is responsible for recovering the VLAN tag and identifying the 
attachment circuit. It is out of the scope of this document to 
define how attachment circuits are represented and associated with 
pseudowires.  
 
The resulted Ethernet frame, as delivered by the In-NSP is not 
modified in any way by the In-PW function.  The In-PW termination 
simply imposes the PW encapsulation for the packet.  This may be 
introducing the optional control word and its fields, depending on 
how the pseudowire was configured and which options were negotiated.  
Following this step, the PW label for the packet is imposed.  
Subsequently, the appropriate forwarding engine component imposes 
the PSN encapsulation.  How the PSN encapsulation is determined and 
imposed for a particular pseudowire is out of the scope of this 
document. 
 
Once the packet is delivered to the network, the PSN encapsulation 
directs the packet towards the egress endpoint of the pseudowire.  
At the egress, the PSN encapsulation is removed.  Following this, 
the packet is delivered to the Out-PW termination function.  The 
Out-PW function removes the PW encapsulation.  This involves 
removing both the PW label and the optional control word (if 
negotiated and present).  In addition, the PW label is used to 
identify an Out-NSP function associated with one or more attachment 
circuit(s) that is/are the outgoing interface(s) to the customer.  
The packet is handed to the Out-NSP function which will complete 
processing and hand the packet to the egress attachment circuit.   
 
The Out-NSP function has the responsibility for processing the 
packet in order to prepare it for the egress attachment circuit.  
This would involve, e.g., the insertion, deletion or replacement of 
different Ethernet tags or other Ethernet encapsulation so that it 
can accommodate different types of ACs, for example port, tagged

with one VLAN, tagged with multiple VLANs (QinQ [802.1ad]) or PBB I-
tags. 
 
There are a number of functions that are out of the scope of this 
specification.  The primary reason they are out of scope is that 
they are implementation dependent, and do not relate to the standard 
definition of the Generalized Ethernet Pseudowire (GE-PW).  For 
example, whether the incoming attachment circuit has a pointer to 
the In-NSP function or an index into a table, or how the pseudowire 
is identified within the forwarding engine are not material to the 
definition of the GE-PW. The definition of what the NSP function has 
to perform is also a matter of local configuration. 
 
  
4. Control Plane 

All the PW Setup and Maintenance procedures described in [RFC4447] 
apply to the GE-PW. There is no need for a new PW type. The Ethernet 
type (0x0005) may be used [IANA PWE3] as the new GE-PW procedures 
are backwards compatible with an existing implementation using 
Ethernet type PW - see section 6. The function of an Ethernet tagged 
PW can be also emulated in the NSPs with a GE-PW. 
 
There might be some network scenarios where the required NSP 
capabilities need to be signaled between PEs. This might be the case 
for certain implementations that need to know what kind of NSP they 
need to instantiate for certain PW. Also in some scenarios the 
Service Providers might need to make sure the capabilities of the 
related NSPs match.  
 
An optional NSP capabilities sub-TLV for the Interface Parameters 
TLV [RFC4447] is defined to allow the signaling of NSP capabilities 
between Layer 2 PEs.  
 
The NSP Capabilities sub-TLV is included in the related LDP messages 
for PW setup and maintenance if the transmitting PE needs to verify 
that the remote NSP is capable of performing certain functionality.  
On reception of the NSP Capabilities sub-TLV a Layer 2 PE MUST 
reject the PW Setup if it does not support or if the related NSP is 
not properly configured to support any of the required NSP 
capabilities. If the Layer 2 PE does not understand the NSP 
Capabilities sub-TLV, it should continue the processing of the 
interface parameters while silently discarding the unknown interface 
parameter as per [RFC4447] section 5.5. 
 
The format of the NSP sub-TLV follows the standard format defined 
for all Interface Parameter sub-TLVs [RFC4447]:

The type for NSP Capabilities sub-TLV is to be assigned by IANA 
(0x0D to be confirmed). The following field defines the value length 
in octets. Next is one or a list of NSP capabilities.  
Each Capability is coded as 1 byte code point followed by an 1 byte 
length field (length of the capability parameters in octets)whereas 
the rest of the value field is used to indicate parameters specific 
to the required capability ID.  
 
The following code points are defined in this document:  
  - 001, Service delimiting VLAN tag required; length = 2 octets, 
     value identifies the (tag) Ethernet type (e.g. IEEE 802.1q, 
     802.1ad, 802.1ah) 
  - 002, Tag rewrite; length - 2 octets; value identifies the (tag) 
     Ethernet type, same as for the above 
 
Addditional code points for the NSP Capabilities are to be added as 
the applications are being defined.  
 
 
5. The Control Word 

The OPTIONAL control word specified in [RFC4385] MAY be used for the 
GE-PW. 
 
6. Backwards Compatibility with existing Ethernet PW implementations 

 
The NSP of a GE-PW capable PE that needs to interoperate with older 
implementations may be manually configured to fully emulate the 
behavior of an existing Ethernet PW NSP as described in section 4.1 
and 4.4 of [RFC4448].  
 
The NSP Capabilities sub-TLV may be also used to automatically 
identify the old Ethernet PW implementation. The GE-PW capable PE 
may use the received NSP Capabilities indication to identify the 
regular (Ethernet or Ethernet VLAN) PW implementations.  
The GE-PW capable PE MUST always include the NSP capability sub-TLV 
in the PW setup message. If the PW signaling received from the 
remote PE does not contain the NSP Capability sub-TLV, the local PE 
switches to regular PW mode. If the other Layer 2 PE does not

understand the NSP Capabilities sub-TLV, it should continue the 
processing of the interface parameters while silently discarding the 
unknown interface parameter as per [RFC4447] section 5.5. 
  
 
7. Emulating existing Ethernet Services 

The rationale for redefining the two variants of the Ethernet 
pseudowires is that the GE-PW is a more powerful construct that 
subsumes both of them, prevents the future proliferation of other 
Ethernet PW types and allows the definition of many more services 
than are allowed by strictly following the existing pseudowire 
definitions. 
 
The following examples demonstrate that the right set of NSP and PW 
functions yield not just the known VPWS, VPLS behaviors induced by 
the two existing Ethernet pseudowires, but additional models used by 
service providers, that are not strictly compliant to the existing 
pseudowires. 
 
7.1. GE-PW applicability to Ethernet PW 

The GE-PW allows for emulation of an Ethernet point-to-point service 
between different types of Ethernet Attachment Circuits by simply 
emulating in the ingress NSP the required behavior. Specifically the 
attachment circuits (ACs) may be defined at the PEs to represent the 
whole port, one or more VLAN(s) (tagged, one service delimiting 
VLAN) or a VLAN combination (QinQ/[802.1ad], tagged with two service 
delimiting VLANs) and are mapped to the point-to-point NSP function 
in each PE through local association.  
 
As a result the packet arriving on the local AC is classified as 
belonging to an ingress NSP who may be configured to 
remove/rewrite/add one or more VLAN tags before forwarding the 
packet to the GE-PW termination function that will encapsulate it 
for transport over PSN core. 
Similarly the egress NSP can manipulate encapsulation received over 
GE-PW, adding, replacing or removing one or more tags of different 
types as desired to accommodate different types of egress Ethernet 
interfaces and AC definitions, for example port, tagged with one 
VLAN, tagged with multiple VLANs (QinQ [802.1ad]).  
 
A default behavior for the AC processing function of the NSPs 
corresponding to the Ethernet PW type can be defined as follows: 
  - Assume one or more service delimiting tags are used by one of 
     the NSPs (NSP1) to identify the AC. The other NSP (NSP2) might 
     use a different set of service delimiting tags to identify the 
     AC.

Internet-Draft   Generalized Ethernet Pseudowire   July 2008 
 
  - If a packet arrives at NSP1, the related in-NSP AC function 
     removes the service delimiting tags after AC identification 
     then performs the rest of the operations as described above. 
  - At the NSP2, the corresponding out-NSP AC function adds for 
     each AC the local service delimiting tags.  
  - This default behavior provides flexibility of supporting 
     interworking between any kind of ACs without one PE needing to 
     know what the remote PEs is using for AC identification. 
 
 
7.2. GE-PW Applicability to Ethernet VLAN PW 

Starting from the default behavior outlined in the previous section 
for GE-PW, one can emulate the Ethernet VLAN mode by simply 
configuring the in-NSP to insert a service delimiting VLAN tag 
before sending the packet to the in-PW processing function. 
Alternatively the need for service delimiting VLAN tag can be 
indicated from the egress PE via the NSP capability TLV using code 
point 001 as described in the Control Plane section. The type of tag 
to be inserted (IEEE 802.1q, IEEE 802.1ad or proprietary) can be 
specify in the parameter field of the capability. 
 
 
7.3. GE-PW Applicability to VPWS and VPLS 

The GE-PW can be used to serve the interconnect needs for the VPWS 
and VPLS Forwarders. The previous section discussed how the GE-PW 
can replace the existing Ethernet PW types from a point to point 
forwarding perspective, handling also the VLAN tags on a per local 
AC basis.  
 
VPWS is really a collection of point-to-point virtual circuits, each 
of them built as an individual PW context with full (in-NSP, in-PW, 
out-PW, out NSP) functions. As demonstrated in the previous two 
sections the GE-PW construct can emulate either of the existing 
behaviors (Ethernet or Ethernet VLAN PWs) for each of the individual 
virtual circuits, providing this way full support for any possible 
VPWS combination supported by the existing PW types. 
 
For VPLS the NSPs will have to replicate the same in-NSP AC, out-NSP 
AC functions but for multiple ACs, handling also the Ethernet 
switching functions (e.g. MAC switching, MAC Learning, Packet 
Replication) as described in [RFC4664] and [RFC4762]. Translating 
the default behavior for the Ethernet PW type that means each in-NSP 
will remove the tags configured for AC identification and each out-
NSP will add the tags configured for AC identification providing 
flexible support for any AC combination in the same VPLS.

7.4. GE-PW for point-to-point transport of PBB over Pseudowires 

When a PW interconnects two PBB access networks (see Figure 1), 
there may be a need to use the PBB ISID Tag (I-tag) [802.1ah] to 
perform the mapping to/from ACs. The PBB I-tag can be processed as 
an extended tag that may need to be changed at ingress / egress PE. 
The related NSPs of a GE-PW can be configured to identify the I-tag 
(using the Ethernet type assigned by [802.1ah]) and to change 
different I-tag fields, for example the 24 bits ISID or the QoS 
information as required. Alternatively the NSP capability code point 
002 can be used to indicate the required rewrite of the I-tag fields 
for an out-NSP that can not perform this sort of processing. The 
parameter value of the code point 002 will specify the Ethernet type 
for I-tag [802.1ah].  
 
The GE-PW (in-PW or out-PW) termination functions will not need to 
change to accommodate this new type of service. The required PW 
encapsulation described in the previous sections will be added 
before the PBB Backbone MAC header.  
 
For example assuming the PE depicted in Figure 1 [RFC4448] is 
connected to a PBB network (PBBN) and the I-tag field is used to 
defined the AC.

                          Figure 1: PBB/PW 
 
The ingress PE may be configured to check on the incoming PBB 
packets the ISID value of the I-tag to determine the AC and 
subsequently the ingress NSP. The ingress NSP may be configured to 
change the values of different I-tag fields (for example the ISID, 
PCP, DEI bits).

Next the GE-PW termination functions will handle the PW header that 
will transport it throughout the PSN core and towards the egress 
NSP.  
 
The egress NSP may perform different functions depending on the type 
of egress AC: e.g.  
  - if the access network is part of a different PBB service domain 
     it may re-write the I-tag field. 
  - if the access domain is a QinQ domain it may remove the PBB 
     header altogether assuming it supports this capability. 
 
7.5. PBB-VPLS Applicability 

The GE-PWs can be also applied to provide the interconnect between 
PBB-VPLS entities as described in [PBB-VPLS]. On top of the I-tag 
identification, processing functions described in the previous 
section, the related NSPs can emulate the PBB components described 
in [802.1ah], for example the Backbone (B) and Customer (I) 
components. For example, in a PBB-VPLS PE, as the In-NSP function 
receive the packet on the local AC, it may remove (default behavior)  
the service tags configured locally for each AC identification. Then 
it performs the Customer MAC switching and possibly the mapping to 
the Backbone MAC address specific to the I-component [802.1ah]. 
Subsequently the same In-NSP function will perform the Backbone MAC 
switching function characteristic to the B-component [802.1ah]. If 
the packet is to be transported over the PW infrastructure it will 
be handled to the in-PW function as per [PBB-VPLS]. From now on the 
processing steps described in the previous sections for various 
types of PW behaviors apply. Same for the Out-PW termination 
function in the other PE. The PW service label is used by the Out-PW 
function to identify the Out-NSP to which the packet is handled. 
There are two possibilities for the Out-NSP. 
 
If the PE is the final termination point for PBB, the Out-NSP runs 
both I and B components (PBB BEB node in [802.1ah]). It will handle 
first the Ethernet switching functions for Backbone MAC header 
followed by the switching functions for Customer MAC header. As the 
packet is handled to the egress AC the regular AC processing 
functions described in the previous sections apply. As a default 
behavior the out-NSP will add the service tags configured locally 
for AC identification. 
 
If an HVPLS architecture is used the next PE in the chain may be 
just an intermediate switching point for Backbone MAC header. The 
related Out-NSP function runs just the PBB B-component (PBB BCB node 
in [802.1ah]). It will handle just the Ethernet switching functions 
for Backbone MAC header. The possible results may be switching the 
packet back to another In-PW function for further forwarding towards 
the PBB-VPLS PE (PBB BEB).

[PBB-VPLS] and [PBB-Interop] describe the requirements, 
interoperability and solution in detail.  
 
Other applications are possible and require just the definition of 
the required NSP functions.  
 
8. Management Model 

There will be a new object to describe the NSP compatibility 
capabilities [PW MIB].
