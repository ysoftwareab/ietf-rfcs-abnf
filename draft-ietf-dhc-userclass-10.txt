Abstract

   This option is used by a DHCP client to optionally identify the type
   or category of user or applications it represents.
   The information contained in this option is an opaque field that
   represents the user class of which the client is a member.
   Based on this class, a DHCP server selects the appropriate address
   pool to assign an address to the client and the appropriate
   configuration parameters.
   This option should be configurable by a user.
                    The User Class Option for DHCP         August 2000


1. Introduction

   DHCP administrators may define specific user class identifiers to
   convey information about a client's software configuration or about
   its user's preferences. For example, the User Class option can be
   used to configure all clients of people in the accounting department
   with a different printer than clients of people in the marketing
   department.



2. Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].



3. DHCP Terminology

   o "DHCP client"
   A DHCP client or "client" is an Internet host using DHCP to obtain
   configuration parameters such as a network address.

   o "DHCP server"
   A DHCP server or "server" is an Internet host that returns
   configuration parameters to DHCP clients.

   o "binding"
   A binding is a collection of configuration parameters, including at
   least an IP address, associated with or "bound to" a DHCP client.
   Bindings are managed by DHCP servers.



4. User Class option

   This option is used by a DHCP client to optionally identify the type
   or category of user or applications it represents.
   A DHCP server uses the User Class option to choose the address pool
   it allocates an address from and/or to select any other
   configuration option.

   This option is a DHCP option [1, 2].

   This option MAY carry multiple User Classes.
   Servers may interpret the meanings of multiple class specifications
   in an implementation dependent or configuration dependent manner,
   and so the use of multiple classes by a DHCP client should be based
   on the specific server implementation and configuration which will
   be used to process that User class option.
                    The User Class Option for DHCP         August 2000


   The format of this option is as follows:

         Code   Len   Value
        +-----+-----+---------------------  . . .  --+
        | 77  |  N  | User Class Data ('Len' octets) |
        +-----+-----+---------------------  . . .  --+

   where Value consists of one or more instances of User Class Data.
   Each instance of User Class Data is formatted as follows:

         UC_Len_i     User_Class_Data_i
        +--------+------------------------  . . .  --+
        |  L_i   | Opaque-Data ('UC_Len_i' octets)   |
        +--------+------------------------  . . .  --+

   Each User Class value (User_Class_Data_i) is indicated as an opaque
   field.
   The value in UC_Len_i does not include the length field itself and
   MUST be non-zero.
   Let m be the number of User Classes carried in the option. The
   length of the option as specified in Len must be the sum of the
   lengths of each of the class names plus m:
   Len= UC_Len_1 + UC_Len_2 + ... + UC_Len_m + m.
   If any instances of User Class Data are present, the minimum value
   of Len is two (Len = UC_Len_1 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2).

   The Code for this option is 77.

   A server that is not equipped to interpret any given user class
   specified by a client MUST ignore it (although it may be reported).
   If a server recognizes one or more user classes specified by the
   client, but does not recognize one or more other user classes
   specified by the client, the server MAY use the user classes it
   recognizes.

   DHCP clients implementing this option SHOULD allow users to enter
   one or more user class values.



5. IANA Considerations

   Option 77, which IANA has already assigned for this purpose, should
   be used as the User Class Option for DHCP.



6. Security Considerations

   DHCP currently provides no authentication or security mechanisms.
   Potential exposures to attack are discussed is section 7 of the
   protocol specification [1].
                    The User Class Option for DHCP         August 2000


   This lack of authentication mechanism means that a DHCP server
   cannot check if a client or user is authorised to use a given User
   Class.
   This introduces an obvious vulnerability when using the User Class
   option. For example, if the User Class is used to give out a special
   parameter (e.g. a particular database server), there is no way to
   authenticate a client and it is therefore impossible to check if a
   client is authorised to use this parameter.
