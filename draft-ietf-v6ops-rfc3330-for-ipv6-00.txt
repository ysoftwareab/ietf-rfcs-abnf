Internet-Draft         Special-Use IPv6 Addresses             March 2007


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the global and other specialized IPv6 address
   blocks.It does not address IPv6 address space assigned to operators
   and users through the Regional Internet Registries.  These
   descriptions are useful for route and IP filtering, for documentation
   and other purposes.

   The document is structured by address types.

   Some tips about filtering are given, but are not mandatory to
   implement.


2.  Address Types

2.1.  Node-scoped Unicast

   ::1/128 is the loopback address [RFC4291].

   ::/128 is the unspecified address [RFC4291].

   The node-scoped unicast addresses should not be advertised and should
   be filtered out when received.

2.2.  IPv4-Mapped Addresses

   ::FFFF:0:0/96 is the IPv4-mapped addresses [RFC4291].  IPv4-mapped
   addresses should not be advertised and should be filtered out when
   received.

2.3.  Link-scoped Unicast

   fe80::/10 are the link-local unicast[RFC4291] addresses.Link-local
   addresses should not be advertised and should be filtered out when
   received.

2.4.  Site-scoped Unicast

   fc00::/7 are the unique-local addresses [RFC4193].  Unique-local
   addresses should not be adverstied on the public Internet.

2.5.  Documentation Prefix

   The 2001:0db8::/32 are the documentation addresses [RFC3849].  They
   are used for documentation purposes such as user manuals, RFCs, etc.
   Documentation addresses should not be advertised and should be
   filtered out when received.

2.6.  6to4

   2002::/16 are the 6to4 addresses [RFC4291][RFC3056].  The 6to4
   addresses may be advertised when the site is running a 6to4 relay or
   offering a 6to4 transit service.  However, the provider of this
   service should be aware of the implications of running such
   service[RFC3964], which includes some specific filtering rules for
   6to4.

2.7.  Teredo

   2001::/32 are the Teredo addresses [RFC4380].  The Teredo addresses
   may be advertised when the site is running a Teredo relay or offering
   a Teredo transit service.

2.8.  6bone

   5f00::/8 were the addresses of the first instance of the 6bone
   experimental network [RFC1897].

   3ffe::/16 were the addresses of the second instance of the 6bone
   experimental network [RFC2471].

   Both 5f00::/8 and 3ffe::/16 were returned to IANA [RFC3701].  These
   addresses are subject to future allocation, similar to current
   unallocated address space.  These addresses should not be advertised
   and should be filtered out when received until they are reallocated.

2.9.  Default Route

   ::/0 is the default unicast route address.

2.10.  Multicast

   ff00::/8 are multicast addresses [RFC4291].  They have a 4 bits scope
   in the address field.  Only addresses having the 'E' value in the
   scope field are of global scope, all other values are local or
   reserved.  Therefore, only ffXe:: routes may be advertised outside a
   site, where X may be any value.

   Multicast routes must not appear in unicast routing tables.


3.  Security Considerations

   This document list addresses and guidelines associated with them.
   The guidelines should improve the security of networks by the
   filtering of invalid routing prefixes.
