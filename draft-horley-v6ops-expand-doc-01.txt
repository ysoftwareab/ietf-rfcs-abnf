  Reserving Additional IPv6 Address Prefixes for Use in Documentation
                    draft-horley-v6ops-expand-doc-01

Abstract

   To reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion when relating
   documented examples to deployed systems, the IPv6 unicast address
   prefix 2001:db8::/32 is reserved for use in examples in documentation
   including RFCs, books, articles, vendor manuals, etc.  This document
   proposes the reservation of additional IPv6 prefixes for this
   purpose; specifically, 3ffe::/16 (formerly 6bone) and fec0::/10
   (formerly site-local).

1.  Introduction

   The address architecture for IPv6 [RFC4291] does not specifically
   allocate any IPv6 address prefixes for documentation purposes.  The
   current IPv6 documentation prefix of 2001:db8::/32 defined in
   [RFC6890] is not large enough for many design and documentation
   requirements.  No additional documentation prefix(es) were allocated
   in the most recent IPv6 Specification [RFC8200].

   These are example use cases that require a documentation IPv6 prefix
   larger than a /32:

   o  Ability to document network architectures (including addressing
      plans) larger than a /32 (Service Providers, Enterprise,
      Government, IoT, Energy),

   o  Ability to document mergers and acquisitions designs for large
      networks (multiple /32 prefix space or larger, plus networks with
      multiple ASNs),

   o  Reduction of operational impacts by having sufficiently large IPv6
      prefixes dedicated for documenting and sharing designs and best
      practices,

   o  Ability to depict unique IPv6 prefix identification (simple visual
      representation to identify separate networks)

   The following existing criteria are beneficially extended to the
   additional documentation prefixes:

   o  Filters are already commonly in use to block the existing
      documentation prefix from the Internet.

   o  There are no operational impacts to IANA or the RIRs with
      documentation prefix space.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to are to be interpreted as described
   in BCP 14 [RFC2119] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals,
   as shown here.

3.  Documentation IPv6 Address Prefixes

   The additional IPv6 address prefixes allocated for documentation
   purposes are 3ffe::/16 (formerly 6bone - [RFC3701]) and fec0::/10
   (formerly site-local - [RFC3879]), resulting in the following
   prefixes for use in documentation:

   o  fec0::/10

   o  3ffe::/16

   o  2001:db8::/32 - existing as defined in [RFC3879]

4.  Operational Implications

   The addition of IPv6 address prefixes for documentation implies that
   IPv6 network operators should add these address prefixes to their
   lists of non-routable/bogon IPv6 address space.  If packet filters
   are deployed in live networks, these address prefixes should be added
   to those filters intended to prevent any public routing of such
   address space.

   Because the 3ffe::/16 address prefix was previously used for the
   subsequently decommissioned 6bone network, this address prefix is

   included in many existing non-routable prefix filters and lists.  Its
   precedence value per [RFC6724] is 1, which limits its usability in
   production networks.  In addition, the 3ffe::/16 address prefix was
   returned to IANA and is available to be reserved for documentation
   purposes.

   Similarly the fec0::/10 address prefix was previously used for site-
   local addressing, and thus is already included in many non-routable
   prefix filters and lists.  Its precedence value per [RFC6724] is 1,
   which limits its usability in production networks.  In addition, the
   fec0::/10 address prefix was returned to IANA and is available to be
   reserved for documentation purposes.

   As a documentation prefix, the former site-local scope of fec0::/10
   is considered deprecated and filters may be required and used with
   any scope.

5.  IANA Considerations

   These documentation prefixes have limited impact on IANA and no
   impact on any RIRs.

   IANA is to record the allocation of the IPv6 global unicast address
   prefix 3ffe::/16 and fec0::/10 as documentation-only prefixes in the
   IPv6 address registry.  No end-user or service provider/LIR is to be
   assigned these addresses.

6.  Security Considerations

   IPv6 addressing documentation has no direct impact on Internet
   security.

   However, the assignment of a new address space for documentation
   purposes does mean, as indicated above, that these addresses SHOULD
   be added to any filters required by individual operators to prevent
   their use for globally routed destinations.

   Lord, and Philip Smith, in authoring the previous proposal for the
   IPv6 documentation prefix.
