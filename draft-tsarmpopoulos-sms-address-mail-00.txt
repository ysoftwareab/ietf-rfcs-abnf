Abstract

   Short Messaging System (SMS) is widely used by GSM mobile phones for
   the transmission of text messages. This memo extends the "Minimal
   GSTN address format in Internet Mail" with a new "service-selector"
   value, which allows the interaction of Internet addressing with
   Mobile Terminated (MT) SMS addressing.

   The purpose of the memo is to facilitate the transmission of SMS
   messages using the familiar e-mail client application.


1. Introduction

   The interaction of Global Switched Telephone Network (GSTN)
   addressing with Internet Mail, which is defined in [1], allows the
   development of gateways with other messaging systems, such as Fax
   [2] and SMS.


 Tsarmpopoulos              Internet Draft                           1


             Minimal SMS address format in Internet Mail     May 1999


   This memo describes the MINIMAL addressing method and extensions to
   encode the SMS addresses in e-mail addresses, as required in [1].

   There are two major objectives:

   - enable an e-mail user to send Mobile Terminated (MT) SMS messages
   from the familiar e-mail client interface.
   - facilitate the use of Internet Mail as a transport mechanism for
   SMS messages.

   This method for sending SMS messages through Internet mail allows
   mobile network operators to install and publish the addresses of
   Email-to-SMS gateways, to facilitate the exchange of messages
   between the GSM-SMS and the Internet Mail messaging systems.

   All implementation supporting this SMS over e-mail address format
   MUST support as a minimum the specification described in this
   document.


2. Terminology and Conventions used in this document

   In this document, the formal definitions are given using the ABNF
   syntax [3].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [4].

   The following terms are also defined:

     I-sms device:
        A device, which has an Internet domain name and is able to send
        directly or indirectly SMS messages.

     mta-I-sms:
        The Internet domain name that identifies uniquely an I-sms
        device over the Internet

     sms-email:
        The complete Internet e-mail address structure, which is used
        to transport an SMS address over the Internet e-mail service.


3. Minimal SMS address

   The minimal SMS address is defined in accordance with RFC 2303 [1].
   The string ôSMSö is assigned to the ôservice selectorö element. The
   formal definitions follow:

        service-selector = "SMS"



Tsarmpopoulos               Internet Draft                           2


             Minimal SMS address format in Internet Mail     May 1999





   Therefore, the minimal specification of an SMS in e-mail address is:

        sms-address = sms-mbox
    and

        sms-mbox = "SMS=" global-phone

   The Minimal supported syntax for "global-phone" is defined in
   reference [1]. We give the definition also here:

        global-phone= "+" 1*( DIGIT , written-sep )

        written-sep = ( "-" , "." )

   The use of other dialling schemas for PSTN numbers is also allowed,
   but support for the "global-phone" syntax is compulsory.

   If a proprietary dialling schema is used, it MUST NOT use the
   leading "+" between the "=" sign and the dialling string. The "+"
   sign is strictly reserved for the standard "global-phone" syntax.

   Note:
   The specification of alternate dialling schemas is out of the scope
   for this minimal specification

   ImplementersÆ Note:
   Although using the "written-sep" element facilitates users,
   implementers are not encouraged to include them when submitting
   messages to the Message Transport System.


3.2 Examples of a minimal "sms-address"

   The following addresses are valid "sms-address" values:

        SMS=+441612327220
        SMS=+30-421-30600


4. The e-mail address of the I-sms device: mta-I-sms

   An I-sms device has a name, which identifies it by the Internet Mail
   system. This is the Right Hand Side (RHS) part of the address, i.e.
   the part on the right of the "@" sign. This part will be referred to
   as "mta-I-sms".

        mta-I-sms = domain

   For "domain" strings used in SMTP transmissions, the string MUST
   conform to the requirements of the specifications [5], [7]. For

Tsarmpopoulos               Internet Draft                           3


             Minimal SMS address format in Internet Mail     May 1999


   "domain" strings used in message content headers, the string MUST
   conform to the requirements of the standards [6], [7].


5. The sms-email

   The complete structure of an SMS-to-Email address is called "sms-
   email". This object is a valid e-mail address, based on the rules
   defined in [6] and [7]. It's special structure allows the SMS number
   to be identified.

        sms-email = ["/"] sms-address ["/"] "@" mta-I-sms

   The "/" characters may result from other mail transport service
   gateways, such as X.400.

   Implementers' Note:
   The "/" characters SHOULD be accepted but SHOULD NOT be generated.
   Gateways are allowed to strip them off when converting to Internet
   mail addressing.

   It is essential to remind that ôsms-addressö element MUST strictly
   follow the ôquoting rulesö specified in the relevant standards [6],
   [7].


5.2 Some examples of minimal "sms-email" addresses

        SMS=+448957375644@smsworld.org
        /SMS=+44342385874/@smsworld.org
        SMS=+44-5869-318945@smsworld.org


6. Conclusion

   By using a standard extension mechanism of the Minimal PSTN address
   format in Internet Mail, this proposal defines a new element and
   facilitates the delivery of SMS messages to mobile phones through
   the Internet Mail system.

   The extension proposed in this memo does not affect or require any
   changes to the existing e-mail software.


7. Collected Formal Syntax

        sms-address = sms-mbox

        sms-mbox = "SMS=" global-phone

        global-phone= "+" 1*( DIGIT , written-sep )

        written-sep = ( "-" , "." )

8. Security Considerations

   The extension proposed in this memo is based on the existing e-mail
   mechanisms; thus it is vulnerable to the same type of attacks found
   for the Internet Mail System. In particular, The routing of e-mail
   messages is determined by Domain Name System (DNS) information,
   therefore a successful attach on this service could force the mail
   path via some particular gateway or message transfer agent, where
   mail security can be affected by compromised software. DNS security
   mechanisms are defined in [9] and as they become more widely
   supported by software implementations clients SHOULD employ those
   mechanisms to verify the authenticity and integrity of mail routing
   records.

   Junk email is considered important threat to the system, because it
   may flood the mobile network with SMS messages. For this reason, it
   is strongly recommended that SMTP servers are configured to validate
   the identity of the sender and possibly to restrict the number of
   messages posted from a specific email address in a "per day" or "per
   hour" basis.
