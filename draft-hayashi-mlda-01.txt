Abstract

   This memo documents the Multicast Listener Discovery Authentication
   protocol (MLDA). MLDA provides not only the functionality of
   multicast listener discovery between hosts and their first-hop
   routers as MLD does, with the addition of user authentication and
   accounting. MLDA is designed to be used in a controlled or managed
   IPv6 multicast environment, when authentication and accounting are
   required. The user authentication information in MLDA can enable a
   provider to control the distribution of the multicast traffic as well
   as to collect real time user accounting information. MLDA also use
   same ICMPv6 [ICMPv6] (IP Protocol 58) message types, rather than IGMP
   (IP Protocol 2) message types as same as that of IGMP.


1. Introduction

   IP multicast provides an efficient mechanism for delivering packets
   to multiple destinations. Unfortunately, IP multicast services,
   especially commercial IP multicast services, are not widely deployed.
   One of the important obstacles to its deployment is related to the

   current IP multicast model.

   The current IP multicast model provides by nature a non-secure,
   non-controlled way for end systems attached to a network to access
   multicast traffic. Lack of access control in this model makes it
   difficult for a service provider to generate enough revenue to
   sustain multicast services such as IP multicast-based Internet TV.

   A provider can enforce such access control through static
   configuration on the last-hop network devices, including Ethernet
   switches or routers. There are two major disadvantages to this
   approach. First, static configuration does not fit into the
   environment where the access control policy changes dynamically.
   Second, the access control policy can only be based on physical
   ports, host's IP or MAC addresses, and hence it can not be used in an
   environment where user based access control policy is required. This
   leads to the need for a comprehensive way to authenticate and
   authorize end systems before they are granted access to some
   multicast groups.

   This need is met by the Multicast Listener Discovery Authentication
   protocol (MLDA). IGAP allows last-hop network devices to enforce
   multicast  receiver access control in a non-shared access-control
   environment. MLDA provides not only multicast listener control
   but also user authentication and accounting. MLDA can be used when
   authentication and accounting are required for multicast data access
   by a multicast group, while MLD can be used when they are not
   required. MLDA is used only in an IPv6 environment. MLDA enables an
   IP multicast service provider to authenticate and authorize a host's
   requests to join a specific multicast group based on its user's
   authentication information and then to control the user's
   authentication information and then to control the user's access to
   the multicast traffic accordingly.

   MLDA employs a user-based authentication model rather than an
   authentication model based upon IP or MAC address. The benefits of a
   user-based model are well known: operational simplicity and
   flexibility, in particular with respect to adds, moves, and changes.

   Another issue that discourages the wide deployment of IP multicast
   services is the lack of multicast network management functions,
   especially an effective multicast accounting function. Effective
   user-based accounting information is critical in two aspects. On one
   hand, network providers of commercial multicast services need to
   accurately identify the users and collect their usage information to
   generate correct billing information. On the other hand, some content
   providers need to learn the content usage information. For example,
   in IP multicast based Internet TV services, network providers need to
   know which TV program is being watched and how long a user watches so
   that they can charge the user based on the value of the TV program.
   In addition, content providers and TV program owners need to know the



Hayashi, He, Tanabe, Satou, Niki                                [Page 2]

Internet Draft          draft-hayashi-mlda-01.txt            April, 2004


   number of viewers of a TV program and how long they watch the TV
   program in order to generate appropriate advertisement revenue.

   MLDA combines user information, including user ID, with the multicast
   addresses that reflect the different content. Authenticated and
   authorized address listener requests enable providers to effectively
   collect the user usage information for different content. MLDA not
   only encourages the wide deployment of new commercial IP multicast
   services, but also can be used in non-commercial environments such as
   enterprises. For example, MLDA can be used for closed video
   broadcasting. MLDA provides a mechanism to allow the access to the
   video broadcasting, only if the user is an authenticated user who is
   allowed to start watching the video broadcasting.

   MLDA transactions flow between an MLDA host client and an MLDA
   router. The MLDA router is assumed to be 1 hop from the MLDA host,
   such that the host does not have a route that bypasses the MLDA
   router. An MLDA host must authenticate itself to an MLDA router in
   order to join a multicast group.


2. MLDA Message Formats

   MLDA is a sub-protocol of ICMPv6, that is, MLDA message types are a
   subset of the set of ICMPv6 messages, and MLDA messages are
   identified in IPv6 packets by a preceding Next Header value of 58.
   All MLDA messages described in this document are sent with a
   link-local IPv6 Source Address, an IPv6 Hop Limit of 1, and an IPv6
   Router Alert option [RTR-ALERT] in a Hop-by-Hop Options header. (The
   Router Alert option is necessary to cause routers to examine MLDA
   messages sent to multicast addresses in which the routers themselves
   have no interest.)

   All MLDA message packets have the following format. The fields from
   Type to Source Address [N] consist of the same fields as MLDv2
   [MLDv2]. An Auxiliary Data is following.

   There are three types of MLDA messages.

      0x96 = MLDA Listener Query  (MLDA Query)

      0x97 = MLDA Listener Acknowledgement  (MLDA ACK)

      0x98 = MLDA Listener Report (MLDA Report)

   All multicast groups should categorized into one of MLD access
   control and MLDA's. Unrecognized message types to a multicast group
   for MLDA should be silently ignored. Other message types may be used
   by newer versions or extensions of MLD, by multicast routing
   protocols, or for other uses.

   User-Specific Query, the value is non-zero. The meaning and the usage
   of this value for MLD are the same as those of the MLD messages as
   described in draft-vida-mld-v2-XX [MLDv2], but we must care the
   Auxiliary field not to exceed an MTU of the link.


2.1.11.  Source Address [i]

   The Source Address [i] fields are a vector of n unicast addresses,
   where n is the value in the Number of Sources (N) field. The meaning
   and the usage of this value are the same as those of the MLD messages
   as described in draft-vida-mld-v2-XX [MLDv2].


2.1.12. Subtype

   This field indicates the subtype of message transferred within the
   MLDA packet. Usage of this field is described later.

   In Type 0x96 (MLDA Query), there are three Subtypes as follows.

      0x01 : General Query
      0x02 : User-Specific Query for Re-authentication (User Query)
      0x11 : Challenge-Response Mechanism Challenge (Challenge)


   In Type 0x97 (MLDA ACK), there are three Aux Types as follows.

      0x21 : Authentication Message

2.1.13. # of Aux (N)

   This field indicates the number of Auxiliary Data Record stored in
   a MLDA packet.


2.1.14 Challenge ID

   This field is meaningful only when Challenge-Response authentication
   mechanism is used. The value is set according to the
   Challenge-Response protocol. If this field is not used, it is set to
   the default value of zero.


2.1.15. Reserved-2

   This field should be set to zero. It is ignored when received.


2.1.16. Auxiliary Data Records

   An MLDA packet can contain zero or more numbers of Auxiliary Data
   Records. The Aux Type field is 1 byte long and specifies the type of
   the Auxiliary Data Record. The Aux Data Len field is 1 byte long and
   specifies the length of the auxiliary data in units of bytes. The Aux
   Data field contains the appropriate data. This document only
   specifies the following Auxiliary Data Records.


2.1.16.1. Aux Type

   0x01 = User Account
   0x02 = User Password
   0x03 = Message
   0x10 = Challenge-Response ID (Challenge ID)

3. Protocol Description

   MLDA is used for controlled or managed multicast services. MLD is not
   useded for the same group address for MLDA. An MLDA router should
   handle a multicast group if it is for MLDA or MLD. MLDA message can
   be differentiated from MLDA messages by the values of the "type"
   fields specified above.

   MLDA tracks an individual host's multicast listener information, in
   order to implement "fast leave" feature. In other words, MLDA does
   not implement Multicast-Address-Specific (or Multicast-Address and
   Source-Specific) Query feature of MLDv2. When a MLDA router receives
   a MLDA report message to cease lintening, it deletes the
   corresponding state information instead of sending an
   Multicast-Address-Specific Query of MLDv2. To facilitate tracking
   information of individual host's listening IP-multicast, MLDA does
   not support the Host suppression feature of MLD.

   MLDA is used for controlled or managed multicast services. A user
   must use MLDA to access such multicast services.

   MLDA specifies different behaviors for MLDA hosts and for MLDA
   routers. If an MLDA router needs to listen some IP multicast
   address, it can perform both parts of the protocol.


3.1 User Authentication Mechanisms

   Currently MLDA supports two user authentication mechanisms for Report
   operation: simple and basic password authentication mechanism [PAP],
   and more advanced challenge-response authentication mechanism
   [CHAP]. These mechanisms are not used at the same time. Only one
   mechanism may be configured for use in a specific network. An MLDA
   implementation must support the password authentication mechanism,
   while the Challenge-response authentication mechanism is optional.
   Any encrypted user information can be transfered on the password
   mechanism between a MLDA host and a AAA server, where MLDA transfers
   the encrypted date on a Report message.

   MLDA is intended for use with standard AAA servers such as RADIUS
   [RADIUS] servers, which, with necessary extensions, can be used to
   achieve the authentication, authorization and accounting functions
   described in this document. However, MLDA is not limited to use with
   standard AAA servers. It can be used with any back-end
   Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting functions or
   mechanisms. These functions or mechanisms can be located in different



Hayashi, He, Tanabe, Satou, Niki                               [Page 12]

Internet Draft          draft-hayashi-mlda-01.txt            April, 2004


   servers, within one server, or even within the MLDA routers. In this
   document, we use AAA servers as an example for these functions or
   mechanisms.

   MLDA router must support to transfer any Auxiliary Data Record of
   a Vendor specific data (0x20, 0xA0~ 0xBF) on MLDA packet to an
   attribute data for Authentication or Accounting process between AAA
   server. The rule depends on a network service. For example, when the
   encrypted data as a user information is transfered to a MLDA router,
   the client may use User Encrypted Information as an Auxiliary Type,
   and the information may be transfered to a AAA server with a vendor
   specific attribute.


3.2 MLDA Host Protocol Description

   This section describes the MLDA host behavior. Based on the
   configured authentication mechanism, an MLDA host behaves


   differently.


3.2.1 Password Authentication Mechanism

   When an MLDA host starts listening to a multicast address on an
   interface, it should immediately transmit an unsolicited MLDA
   Report that has a Subtype field of 0x31 (Password Report) to the
   corresponding address. The Report must have two auxiliary data of
   User Account (Aux Type of 0x01), and User Password (Aux Type of 0x02)
   or Message (Aux Type of 0x03) at least. The Aux Data field of User
   Account is filled with the user account (user ID) while the Aux Data
   Len field is set to the length of the user account. The Aux Data
   field of User Password is filled with the user password while the Aux
   Data Len field is set to the length of the password. The Aux Data
   field of Message is filled with a authentication information
   substitute for the password.

   When a host receives an MLDA Query of Query that has a Subtype field
   of 0x01 or 0x02, it sets delay timers as described in [MLDv2]. If a
   timer for the multicast address is already running, it is reset to
   the random value only if the requested Maximum Response Delay is less
   than the remaining value of the running timer. When a multicast
   address's timer expires, the host sends a Password Report that has a
   Subtype field of 0x31. This message must have an auxiliary data of
   User Account at least for General Query that has a Subtype field of
   0x01. On the other hand, this message must have an auxiliary data of
   User Account and User password at least for User-Specific Query for
   Re-authentication that has a Subtype field of 0x02. The Aux Data
   field is filled with the user account (user ID) while the Account
   Size field is set to the length of the user account. When the MLDA



Hayashi, He, Tanabe, Satou, Niki                               [Page 13]

Internet Draft          draft-hayashi-mlda-01.txt            April, 2004


   Query is User-Specific Query for Re-authentication that has a Subtype
   field of 0x02, the host must send a Password Report with auxiliary
   data of both User Account and Password.

   When an MLDA host ceases to listen to a multicast address, it sends
   an MLDA message to the all-routers multicast address which will be
   specified in [MLDv2]. The maner of message format should be followed
   [MLDv2]. The Report has a auxiliary data of User Account at least.
   The Aux Data field is filled with the user account (user ID) while
   the Aux Data Len field is set to the length of the user account.
   In scenarios where authentication is required, an MLDA host can send
   the Report message that has a Subtype field of 0x31 (Password Report)
   for any ceasing operation. The Password Report must has two auxiliary
   data of User Account and Account Size at least. The Aux Data of User
   Account is set to the values as in Basic Report. The Aux Data of User
   Password field is filled with the user password while the Aux Data
   Len field is set to the length of the password.


3.2.2 Challenge-Response Authentication Mechanism
   When an MLDA host starts listening to a multicast address, it sends a
   Challenge-Request Report Request that has a Subtype field of 0x32
   (Challenge-Response Mechanism Report Challenge Request) to the
   corresponding multicast address. The Request must have a auxiliary
   data of User Account at least. The Aux Data field is filled with the
   user account (user ID) while the Aux Data Len field is set to the
   length of the user account.

   When the MLDA host receives a Challenge that has a Subtype of 0x11
   (Challenge-Response Mechanism Challenge) as a response to the, the
   MLDA client sends a Challenge-Response Report Response that has a
   Subtype of 0x33 (Challenge-Response Mechanism Report Response). The
   Report Response must have three auxiliary data of User Account, User
   Password, and Challenge ID. The Aux Data field of Challenge ID is set
   to the same value of Challenge ID on the Challenge. The Aux Data
   field of User Account is filled with the user account (user ID) while
   the Aux Data Len field is set to the length of the user account. The
   Aux Data field of User Password is set the results of MD5
   calculation. The Aux Data Len field is set to 0x10.

   When a host receives an MLDA Query, it follows the behavior described
   above to set the delay timer. When a address's timer expires, the
   host sends a MLDA Report that has a Subtype field of 0x32. This
   message must have a auxiliary data of User Account at least. The Aux
   Data field is filled with the user account (user ID) while the Aux
   Data Len field is set to the length of the user account.

   When an MLDA host ceases to listen to a multicast address, it sends
   an MLDA Report message to the all-routers multicast address which
   will be specified in [MLDv2]. Normally an MLDA host sends a Basic
   Report message for ceasing to listen as described above. The detail



Hayashi, He, Tanabe, Satou, Niki                               [Page 14]

Internet Draft          draft-hayashi-mlda-01.txt            April, 2004


   maner of message format should be follow [MLDv2]. In scenarios where
   the Report message authentication is required, an MLDA host can send
   a Report message that has a Subtype field of 0x32 (Challenge-Response
   Mechanism Report Challenge Request). The message must have a
   auxiliary data of User Account at least. The Aux Data field is filled
   with the user account (user ID) while the Aux Data Len field is set
   to the length of the user account. When the MLDA host receives a
   Challenge that has a Subtype of 0x11 (Challenge-Response Mechanism
   Challenge) as a response to the Challenge-Response Report Request, it
   sends a Report message that has a Subtype field of 0x43
   (Challenge-Response Mechanism Report Response) with a Multicast
   Address Record for ceasing to listen. The message must have three
   auxiliary data of User Account, User Password, and Challenge ID at
   least. The Aux Data field of User Password is set to the results of
   MD5 calculation. The Aux Data Len field is set to 0x10.

   An MLDA implementation must support Basic Report. Challenge-Response
   Authentication Mechanism Report is optional.


3.3 MLDA Router Protocol Description

   MLDA routers use MLDA to learn which multicast address have listeners
   on each of their interfaces. They can be physical interfaces or
   virtual interfaces such as VLANs. Same as MLD, an MLDA router keeps
   a listener list of multicast address for each attached network, and a
   timer for each address. Each address state has the conceptual
   following format:

      (socket, interface, IPv6 multicast address, filter mode, source
       list, user-id, client IP address, timer(s))

   MLDA routers periodically [Query Interval] send an MLDA Query on each
   attached network to solicit listener information. On startup, a
   router SHOULD send [Startup Query Count] MLDA Queries spaced closely
   together [Startup Query Interval] in order to quickly and reliably
   determine listener information. [Query Interval], [Startup Query
   Count] and [Startup Query Interval] are same as [MLDv2].

   An General Query is addressed to the all-systems multicast address
   (FF02::1), has a Multicast Address field of Zero, has a Maximum
   Response Delay of [Query Response Interval], and has a MLDA Type
   field of 0x01 (General-Query). [Query Response Interval] is same as
   [MLDv2].

   An User Query is addressed to the unicast IP address of the client
   host, has a Multicast Address field of the multicast address the
   client listen, and has a MLDA Type field of 0x02 (User-Specific Query
   for Re-authentication). A Maximum Response Delay of [Query Response
   Interval] is same to that of General Query. [Query Response Interval]
   is same as [MLDv2].

3.3.1 Password Authentication Mechanism

   When an MLDA router receives a Password Mechanism Report (an MLDA
   Report that has a Subtype field of 0x31), if the router already has
   the corresponding listener state of a multicast address, it refreshes
   the associated timer.

   If the router does not have listener state of the multicast address,
   it forwards the user's listener Response request as well as its user
   authentication information, including its user account and password,
   to the back-end AAA server. Based on the AAA server's authentication
   and authorization results, the MLDA router grants or denies the
   user's access request. When the MLDA router grants the request, it
   adds the multicast being reported to the listener list of a multicast
   address on the interface on which it received the Report and sets the
   timer for the address to the [Multicast Listener Interval].

   When an MLDA router receives an MLDA Report message to cease
   listening a multicast group that has listeners on the reception
   interface, it deletes the corresponding multicast address state.

   If an authentication is required in the ceasinng operation, an MLDA
   Report must have a Subtype field of 0x31, and includes a user
   authentication information which is same to a user authentication on
   Password Report, and the router forwards the user's cease
   information as well as the user authentication information to the
   back-end AAA server. If the cease request is authenticated and
   authorized, the router deletes the corresponding listener state of
   a multicast address. Otherwise, the cease request is ignored.


3.3.2 Challenge-Response Authentication Mechanism

   When an MLDA router receives a Challenge-Response Report Request
   has a Subtype field of 0x32, the router tries to establish
   Challenge-Response communication for a Report process, then the
   router sends a Challenge-Response Mechanism Challenge (a Challenge
   that has a Type field of 0x96, a Subtype field of 0x11). The
   Challenge must have three auxiliary data of User Account, User
   Password, and Challenge ID. The Aux Data field of User Account is set
   to the same user ID in the Challenge-Response Report Request, the Aux
   Data field of User Password set to a Challenge value [CHAP], and the
   Aux Data field of Challenge ID set to an ID [CHAP].

   When the MLDA router receives a Challenge-Response Report Response
   that has a Subtype field of 0x33), if the router already has the
   corresponding multicast address listener state, it refreshes the
   associate timer.

   If the router does not have the listener state of a multicast
   address, it forwards the user's listen request information as

   well as its user authentication information including its user
   account and password to the back-end AAA server. Based on the AAA
   server's results of authentication and authorization processes, the
   MLDA router grants or denies the user's access request. When the MLDA
   router grants the request, it adds the multicast address being
   reported to the listener list of multicast address on the interface
   on which it received the Report and sets the timer for the listener
   to the [Multicast Listener Interval].

   When an MLDA router receives an MLDA Report message to cease
   listening to a multicast address that has multicast listeners on the
   reception interface, it deletes the corresponding multicast listener
   state.

   If an authentication is required in the ceasing operation, a host
   oriented Challenge-Response communication is establish between a host
   and the MLDA router. When a MLDA router receives an
   Challenge-Response Report Request to cease listening a multicast
   group that has a Subtype field of 0x32, the router sends a
   Challenge-Response Mechanism Challenge (a Challenge that has a Type
   field of 0x96, a Subtype field of 0x11, a Challenge ID field of an
   ID [CHAP], a User Account set to a user ID in the
   Challenge-Request-Report, and a Message set to a Challenge value
   [CHAP]).

   When the MLDA router receives a Challenge-Response Report Response to
   cease linstening to the multicast address that has a Subtype field of
   0x33. The message must have three auxiliary data of User Account,
   User Password, and Challenge ID at least. Both Aux Data fields of
   User Account and User Password are the same. The Aux Data field of
   User Password is set to the results of MD5 calculation. The Aux Data
   Len field of User Password is set to 0x10, and the router forwards
   the user's multicast address cease information as well as the user
   authentication information to the back-end AAA server. If the address
   cease request is authenticated and authorized, the router deletes the
   corresponding multicast listener state. Otherwise, the cease request
   is ignored.


3.4 Status Notifications

   In controlled or managed multicast environments, it is very important
   to notify a user of its service statuses. MLDA supports the following
   status notifications.


3.4.1 Authentication Result Notification

   When an MLDA router receives the authentication result from the
   back-end AAA server, it notifies the user of the result by unicasting
   an Authentication message to the client.



Hayashi, He, Tanabe, Satou, Niki                               [Page 17]

Internet Draft          draft-hayashi-mlda-01.txt            April, 2004


   The Authentication message has a Type field of 0x97 (MLDA ACK) and
   a Subtype field of 0x21. The Multicast Address field contains the
   corresponding multicast address for authentication. The Maximum
   Response Delay field is not used and is ignored by MLDA clients. It
   can be set to any value. The message has two auxiliary data of User
   Account and Message at least. The Aux Data field of User Account
   contains the user account (user ID) for authentication and the Aux
   Data Len field is set the length of the user account.

   The Aux Data field of Message has the following values at least:

      0x11: Authentication success.
      0x21: Authentication failure.

   The Message Size field is set to the length of the Aux Data. An MLDA
   implementation must support the above mandatory values. It supports
   the any other vendor specific values. Appropriate value is chosen to
   reflect the result from the AAA server as well as other vendor
   specific processes. The process adopted by the MLDA clients upon
   receiving this packet type is up to implementation. However, it must
   not affect other MLDA process.


3.4.2 Accounting Status Notification

   An MLDA router informs the accounting server to start accounting when
   it starts forwarding related multicast traffic into the client's
   network. When the MLDA client ceases to listen to the multicast
   address (either via silent departure or an explicit leave), the
   router informs the accounting server to stop accounting. Once it
   receives the response from the accounting server, it notifies the
   MLDA client by unicasting an Accounting message.

   The Accounting message has a Type field of 0x97 (MLDA ACK) and a
   Subtype field of 0x22. The Multicast Address field, the Maximum
   Response Delay field, the User Account field, and the Account Size
   field are the same as those in the Authentication message described
   in section 3.4.1.

   The Message field has the following values at least:

      0x11: Accounting start
      0x12: Accounting stop

   The Message Size field is set to the length of the Aux Data. An MLDA
   implementation must support the above mandatory values. It supports
   the any other vendor specific values. The process adopted by the MLDA
   client upon receiving this packet type is up to implementation.
   However, it must not affect other MLDA process.

3.5 Validity Period

   For each multicast listener state, an MLDA router SHOULD maintain
   another timer: Validity Period timer. This timer indicates the valid
   period of an accounting to a multicast listener. When the timer is
   expired, an MLDA router needs to re-authenticate the multicast
   listener, then the router sends a MLDA host User-Specific Query for
   Re-authentication besides of General Query. The value of the
   "Validity Period" can be statically configured or dynamically set
   based on the results from the AAA server.

   When "Validity Period" is enforced, an MLDA router checks this timer
   when it receives an MLDA Report. If the timer does not expire, the
   MLDA router send a MLDA host a General Query, and does not ask the
   AAA server a user authentication by a MLDA Report response. If the
   timer expires, it follows the procedures for initial authentication
   described above to re-authenticate the listen request. During the

   re-authentication period, an MLDA router continues forwarding the
   multicast traffic and does not stop accounting. If the
   re-authentication succeeds, an MLDA router resets the multicast
   address timer and the Validity Period timer. If the re-authentication
   fails, an MLDA router stops accounting and deletes the multicast
   address listener state.


4. List of Timers, Counters

   This section describes the parameters set in MLDA router and Host
   when supporting MLDA processes.


4.1. Robustness Variable

   It is the same meaning as MLDv2.


4.2. Timers and Counters for Host

4.2.1. Challenge-Timer

   It controls waiting time from sending Report message to receiving
   Challenge Message.


4.2.2. Host-Authentication-Timer

   It controls waiting time from sending Response Message to receiving
   Authentication Message (accept or reject) from MLDA router.

Internet Draft          draft-hayashi-mlda-01.txt            April, 2004


4.2.3. Host-Accounting-Timer

   It controls waiting time from sending Response Message to receiving
   Accounting Message (start or stop) from MLDA router.


4.2.4. Delaying-Timer

   It controls waiting time from receiving Query to sending Report
   Message to MLDA router. It is calculated from Max Resp Time.


4.2.5. Cease-Retransmission-Counter

   The Cease-Retransmission-Counter is the number of Report messages a
   host retransmits after sending the first Report message. The default
   value is zero.


4.2.6.  Unsolicited-Report-Interval-Timer

   It is the same meaning as MLDv2. The Unsolicited Report Interval is
   the time between repetitions of a node's initial report of interest
   in a multicast address.  Default: 1 second.


4.3. Timers and Counters for MLDA router

4.3.1. Response-Timer

   It controls waiting time from sending Challenge Message to receiving
   Response Message between client host.


4.3.2. Router-Authentication-Timer

   It controls waiting time from sending Authentication request to
   receiving Authentication Response between AAA server.


4.3.3. Router-Accounting-Timer

   It controls waiting time from sending Accounting request to receiving
   Accounting Response between AAA server.


4.3.4. Validity-Timer

   This is an integer multiple of General-Query Interval in units of
   second, and used by MLDA router to determine whether user
   authentication is necessary or not.



Hayashi, He, Tanabe, Satou, Niki                               [Page 20]

Internet Draft          draft-hayashi-mlda-01.txt            April, 2004


4.3.5. Query-Interval-Timer

   It is the same meaning as MLDv2. The Query Interval is the interval
   between General Queries.


4.3.6. Query-Response-Interval-Timer

   It is the same meaning and takes the same default value as MLDv2. The
   Max Response Time inserted into the periodic General Queries.


4.3.7. Multicast-Address-Listener-Interval-Timer

   It is the same meaning as MLDv2. The Multicast Address Listener
   Interval is the amount of time that must pass before a MLDA router
   decides there are no more users of a multicast address on a link.
   This value MUST be ((the Robustness Variable) times (the Query
   Interval)) plus (one Query Response Interval).


4.3.8.  Startup-Query-Interval-Timer

   It is the same meaning and takes the same default value as MLDv2. The
   Startup Query Interval is the interval between General Queries sent
   by a Querier on startup.


4.3.9.  Startup-Query-Count

   It is the same meaning and takes the same default value as MLDv2. The
   Startup Query Count is the number of Queries sent out on startup,
   separated by the Startup Query Interval.


4.3.10 Accounting-Retransmission-Counter

   The Accounting-Retransmission-Counter is the number of Accounting
   messages a router retransmits after sending the first accounting
   message to a host. The default value is zero.


4.3.11 Immediate-Accounting

   The Immediate-Accounting indicates whether a router will start the
   accounting immediately after a MLDA Report is authenticated and
   authorized or start the accounting when the subscribed multicast
   data starts being forwarded. The values are TRUE and FALSE. The
   default value is FALSE.

Internet Draft          draft-hayashi-mlda-01.txt            April, 2004


4.3.12 Free-Ride
   When the value is true, when Router-Authentication-Timer is expired,
   the group is free to access. This variety depends on provider$B!G(Bs
   service.


4.3.13 Accounting-Anyway
   When the value is true, accounting is carried out despite the
   expiration of Router-Accounting-Timer.


5. Security Considerations

   MLDA is based around an asymmetrical trust model in which the MLDA
   router does not trust the MLDA client, but the MLDA client trusts the
   MLDA router. Therefore, it may not be suitable for use in isolation
   where mutual authentication is required.
   MLDA supports password and challenge-response authentication
   mechanisms and inherits the security concerns of each. For multicast
   content encryption related technology, please refer to other IETF
   work. MLDA does not obstruct snooping of multicast traffic by
   unauthorized client that have access to media shared with multicast
   traffic.

   Some of the security issues discussed in MLD document also apply
   here. Please refer to MLDv2 document [MLDv2] for details.


6. IANA Considerations

   This document introduces the following new version and Types of ICMP
   message that require allocation by IANA:

      Type:
         0x96: MLDA Listener Query  (MLDA Query)
         0x97: MLDA Listener Acknowledgment  (MLDA ACK)
         0x98: MLDA Listener Report (MLDA Report)
