Abstract

   [draft-fuxh-pce-boundary-explicit-control-framework-00] defines the
   framework for explicit control of region boundary in PCE-based inter-
   layer architecture.  This document defines the PCEP extension for
   region boundaries explicit control.

Internet-Draft     RSVP-TE for Region Boundary Control        March 2010


1.  Introduction

   [draft-fuxh-pce-boundary-explicit-control-framework-00] defines the
   framework for explicit control of region boundary in PCE-based inter-
   layer architecture.  There is a requirements for PCEP extensions to
   support explicit control of region boundary.  A new object could be
   introduced in PCEP message.


2.  ERBO (Explicit Region Boundary Object)

   The format of ERBO object is the same as an ERO.  The ERBO including
   the region boundaries information can be carried in PCEP message.


3.  RSVP-TE Extension

   The PCEP message is extended as followings:


   <PCRep Message>::=<Common Header>
                                <response-list>
   <response-list>::=<response>[<response-list>]
   <response>::=<RP>
                [<NO-PATH>]
                [<attribute-list>]
                [<path-list>]
   <path-list>::=<path>[<path-list>]
   <path>::= <ERO>[<ERBO>]<attribute-list>
   <attribute-list>::=[<LSPA>] [<BANDWIDTH>] [<metric-list>] [<IRO>] <metric-list>::=<METRIC>[<metric-list>]


4.  Security Considerations

   TBD


5.  IANA Considerations

   TBD
