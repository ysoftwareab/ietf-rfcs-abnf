                   draft-jaehwoon-netext-flowmob-00.txt 

Abstract 


   
   IN Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), a multi-homed MN can connect to the 
   PMIPv6 by using only one interface even though it has multiple 
   interfaces. It would be efficient when such a multi-homed MN can
   connect to the PMIPv6 by using all of its interfaces. If such a 
   multi-homed MN can utilize all of its interfaces, flow mobility can 
   be provided that the MN handovers one or more flows from one 
   interface to another without re-establishing sessions. This document 
   specifies the layer-3 based flow mobility mechanism by considering 
   the intention of the MN. Here, a MN chooses the interface for sending 
   the service traffic and transmits the traffic by using the chosen 
   interface. The PMIPv6 domain can know the intention of the MN when a 
   MAG receives a service flow via a specific network.

Internet-Draft       Flow-based mobility support        July 3, 2010


1. Introduction 


   The Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is considered as the network-based
   mobility management mechanism that the access network within the
   PMIPv6 domain support the mobility of the mobile node (MN) on
   behalf of the MN itself [1]. In PMIPv6, the Mobile Access Gateway
   (MAG) is defined to support the mobility of an MN. The MAG acts as
   the default gateway of the access link to which an MN is connected.
   Also, the Localized Mobility Anchor (LMA) is defined as the Home
   Agent within the PMIPv6 domain.
   
   IN PMIPv6, a multi-homed MN can connect to the PMIPv6 by using only
   one interface even though it has multiple interfaces. It would be
   efficient when such a multi-homed MN can connect to the PMIPv6
   by using all of its interfaces. If such a multi-homed MN can utilize
   all of its interfaces, flow mobility can be provided that the MN
   handovers one or more flows from one interface to another without
   re-establishing sessions.
   
   However, as described before, the PMIPv6 is the network-based 
   mobility management protocol, and PMIPv6 domain cannot know the
   intention of the MN. Therefore, it does not reflect the intention
   of the MN for the PMIPv6 domain to statically assign the interface 
   for a specific flow. For example, assume that a MN connects both to
   3GPP network via an interface and Wireless LAN via another interface
   and exchange the VoIP traffic with the host resided in the Internet.
   Then some users prefer to utilize the 3GPP network that satisfies
   the QoS requirement of the VoIP traffic. On the other hand, other
   users prefer to utilize the Wireless LAN due to its high speed and
   low cost.
   
   This document specifies the layer-3 based flow mobility mechanism by
   considering the intention of the MN. In this document, the service 
   flow is defined by using the 5-tuple composed of source IP address, 
   destination IP address, protocol ID of the transport layer protocol,
   source port number and destination port number. Here, a MN chooses
   the interface for sending the service traffic and transmits the
   traffic by using the chosen interface. The PMIPv6 domain can know the
   intention of the MN when a MAG receives a service flow via a specific
   network.

2. Terminology
   
   Flow Mapping Table Entry (FMTE)
   
      The entry that support the flow handover. The 5-tuple information
      identifying the service flow is included in the entry. The tunnel 
      end-point address for the service flow is also included. 
      
   Service Flow (SF)
   
      The flow that is exchanged between two end hosts. The SF is
      identified by using the 5-tuple information including source IP
      address, destination IP address, protocol ID of the transport
      layer protocol, source port number and destination port number.

                  Figure 1: Message exchange scenario

   In this document, MN is assumed to follow the weak host model [2].
   Figure 1 shows the message exchange scenario considered in this
   document. it is assument that a MN is equipped with 2 interfaces
   and can simultaneouly connect to 2 access network each having
   different access technology within the PMIPv6 domain. In reality,
   the MN can be equipped with N interfaces.
   
   When a MN enters a PMIPv6 domain and connect to a MAG (say, MAG1)
   with one of its interfaces (say, IF1), MAG1 transmits the Proxy
   Binding Update (PBU) message having the MN-ID to LMA as described
   in the PMIPv6 protocol. LMA assignes a network prefix (say, HNP1)
   for the MN and creates the binding cache entry for the MN. The
   HNP1 and Proxy-CoA1 information is include in the binding cache
   entry, where the Proxy-CoA1 is the IP address of the MAG1. And then,
   the LMA sends the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement (PBAck) message
   having HNP1 to MAG1. MAG1 having received the PBAck message announces
   the Router Advertisement (RA) message to the MN. The HNP1 information
   is included in the RA message. MN assigns one IPv6 address 
   (say, MN-HoA1) that belongs to the HNP1. Form now on, MN can
   communicate with a host resided in the Internet. Assume that the MN
   establishes a VoIP session with a correspondent node (CN) in the
   Internet by using the IF1 and exchanges the service flow (say SF1). 
   The SF1 can be classified with 5-tuple information having MN-HoA1, 
   the IP address of CN, protocol IP of the transport layer protocol, 
   source port number and destination port number. While exchanging SF1
   by using IF1, if the MN connects to another MAG (say, MAG2) within
   the same PMIPv6 domain by using another interface (say, IF2), MAG2
   sends the PBU message having the MN-ID to the LMA. The LMA checks
   if there exists the binding cache entry for the MN. If it exists,
   the LMA checks the access technology type (ATT) that is included in
   the PBU message. If the value of the ATT is different, the LMA
   considers that the MN wants to connect to the PMIPv6 domain by using
   both two interfaces (that is, two different networks). The LMA
   assigns another network prefix (say, HNP2) for the MN and adds
   HNP2 and Proxy-CoA2 information in the binding cache entry for the MN
   where Proxy-CoA2 is the IP address of the MAG2. And then, the LMA
   sends the PBAck message having HNP2 and HNP1 to MAG2. The LMA also
   sends the PBAck message having HNP1 and HNP2 to MAG1.
   
   MAG2 having received the PBAck message can know that the MN wants to 
   connect to the PMIPv6 domain via multiple access networks by using 
   the number of network prefixes within the message. MAG2 transmits the
   RA message having HNP2 and HNP1 to the MN. MN having received the RA
   message via IF2 configures one of the IPv6 address (say, MN-HoA2) 
   belonging to HNP2 to IF2. MAG1 having received the PBAck message also
   can know that the MN wants to connect to the PMIPv6 domain via 
   multiple access networks by using the number of network prefixes

   within the message. MAG1 transmits the RA message having HNP1 and
   HNP2 to the MN. The MN finds that the IP address already configured 
   to the IF1 is the subset of the HNP1 that is the first network prefix
   included in the RA message. From now, the MN knows that a multi-homed
   connection is established between it and the PMIPv6 domain. The MN
   can exchange traffic via any one of two interfaces.
   
   After the IP address is configured in the IF2, if the MN decides to
   handover the VoIP traffic exchanged with the CN from IF1 to IF2, it
   transmits the service flow (that is, SF1) via IF2. How the MN decides
   to handover is out of scope of this document. The MAG2 having 
   received the SF1 identifies that the source address of SF1 belongs to 
   HNP1 (not HNP2) and considers that the MN wants the flow handover. 
   MAG2 creates the flow mapping table entry (FMTE) for the MN. The 
   5-tuple information for the SF1 is included in the FMTE for the MN. 
   And then, the MAG2 sends the SF1 to LMA via the tunnel established
   between the LMA and the MAG2. The LMA havind received the SF1 
   identifies that the MN wants the flow handover for the flow. The LMA
   creates the FMTE for the MN that includes 5-tuple information for SF1
   and the IP address of the MAG2 (that is, Proxy-CoA2). And then the
   
   LMA transmits the SF1 to the CN. When the LMA receives the SF1
   transmitted by the CN, it checks the FMTE. If the LMA finds the entry
   matching the same 5-tuple information with the SF1, it transmits
   the SF1 to the MAG2 via the tunnel. Here, the IP address of the MAG2
   is also included in the SMTE. MAG2 also sends the SF1 to the MN after
   having checked its FMTE for the MN.
