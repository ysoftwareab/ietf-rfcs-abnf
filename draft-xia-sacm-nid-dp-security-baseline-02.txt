1.  Introduction

1.1.  Objective

   Network security is an essential part of the overall network
   deployment and operation.  Due to the following reasons, network
   infrastructure devices (e.g. switch, router, firewall) are always the
   objective and exploited by the network attackers, which bring damages
   to the victim network:

   o  The existence of a lot of unsafe access channels: for the history
      reason, some old and unsafe protocols still run in the network
      devices, like: SNMP v1/v2, Telnet, etc, and are not mandatory to
      be replaced by the according safer protocols (SNMP v3, SSH).
      Attackers easily exploit them for attack (e.g., invalid login,
      message eavesdropping);

Internet-DraNetwork Infrastructure Device Data Plane Security  June 2018


   o  The openness nature of TCP/IP network: despite the benefits of
      network architecutre design and connectivity brought by the
      network openness, a lot of threats exist at the same time.
      Spoofing address, security weakness for various protocols, traffic
      flooding, and other kinds of threat are originated from the
      network openness;

   o  The security challenge by the network complexity: network are
      becoming more complex, with massive nodes, various protocols and
      flexible topology.  Without careful design and strict management,
      as well as operation automation, the policy consistency of network
      security manangment cannot be ensured.  It's common that part of
      the network infrastructure is subject to attack;

   o  The complex functionality of device: the complexity of device
      itself increases the difficulty of carring out the security
      hardening measurements, as well as the skill requirements to the
      network administrator.  As a result, the network administrator may
      not be capable of or willing to realize all the security
      measurements, in addition to implementing the other basic
      functionalities;

   o  The capacity and capability mismatching between the data plane and
      the control plane: there are a large mismatching of the traffic
      processing capacity and capability between different planes.
      Without effective control, the large volume of traffic from the
      data plane will flooding attack the other planes easily.

   Therefore, the importance of ensuring the security of the network
   infrastructure devices is out of question.  To secure the network
   infrastructure devices, one important task is to identify as far as
   possible the threats and vulnerabilities in the device itself, such
   as: unnecessary services, insecure configurations, abnormal status,
   etc, then enforce the corresponding security hardening measurements,
   such as: update the patch, modify the security configuration, enhance
   the security mechanism, etc.  We call this task the developing and
   deploying the security baseline for the network infrastructure, which
   provides a solid foundation for the overall network security.  This
   document aims to describe the security baseline for the network
   infrastructure, which is called security baseline in short in this
   document.

1.2.  Security Baseline

   Basically, security baseline can be designed and deployed into
   different layers of the devices:

   o  application layer: refers to the application platform security
      solution and the typical application security mechanisms it
      provided like: identity authentication, access control, permission
      management, encryption and decryption, auditing and tracking,
      privacy protection, to ensure secure application data
      transmission/exchange, secure storage, secure processing, ensuring
      the secure operation of the application system.  Specific examples
      may be: web application security, software integrity protection,
      encryption of sensitive data, privacy protection, and lawful
      interception interfaces and secure third-party component;

   o  network layer: refers to a series of security measures, to protect
      the network resources and network services running on the device
      network platform.  Network layer security over network product is
      complicated.  Therefore, it is divided into data plane, control
      plane, management plane to consider:

      *  data plane: focus on the security hardening configuration and
         status to protect the data plane traffic against eavesdropping,
         tampering, forging and flooding attacking the network;

      *  control plane: focus on the control signaling security of the
         network infrastructure device, to protect their normal exchange
         against various attacks (i.e., eavesdropping, tampering,
         forging and flooding attack) and restrict the malicious control
         signaling, for ensuring the correct network topology and
         forwarding behavior;

      *  management plane: focus on the management information and
         platform security.  More specific, it includes all the security
         configuration and status involved in the network OAM process;

   o  infrastructure layer: refers to all the security design about the
      device itself and its running OS.  As the foundation of the upper
      layer services, the secure infrastructure layer must be assured.
      The specific mechanisms include: OS security, key management,
      cryptography security, certificate management, software integrity.

1.3.  Security Baseline Data Model Design

   The security baseline varies according to many factors, like:
   different device types (i.e., router, switch, firewall), the
   supporting security features of device, the specific security
   requirements of network operator.  It's impossible to design a
   complete set for it, so this document and the companion ones are
   going to propose the most important and universal points of them.
   More baseline contents can be added in future following the data
   model scheme specified.

   [I-D.ietf-birkholz-sacm-yang-content] defines a method of
   constructing the YANG data model scheme for the security posture
   assessment of the network infrastructure device by brokering of YANG
   push telemetry via SACM statements.  The basic steps are:

   o  use YANG push mechanism[I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push]to collect the
      created streams of notifications (telemetry)
      [I-D.ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications]providing SACM content
      on SACM data plane, and the filter expressions used in the context
      of YANG subscriptions constitute SACM content that is imperative
      guidance consumed by SACM components on SACM management plane;

   o  then encapsulate the above YANG push output into a SACM Content
      Element envelope, which is again encapsulated in a SACM statement
      envelope;

   o  lastly, publish the SACM statement into a SACM domain via xmpp-
      grid publisher.

   In this document, we follow the same way as [I-D.ietf-birkholz-sacm-
   yang-content] to define the YANG output for network infrastructure
   device security baseline posture based on the SACM information model
   definition [I-D.ietf-sacm-information-model].

1.4.  Summary

   The following contents propose part of the security baseline YANG
   output for network infrastructure device: data plane security
   baseline.  The companion documents [I-D.ietf- dong-sacm-nid-cp-
   security-baseline], [I-D.ietf-lin-sacm-nid-mp-security-baseline], [I-
   D.ietf-xia-sacm-nid-app-infr-layers-security-baseline] cover other
   parts of the security baseline YANG output for network infrastructure
   device respectively: control plane security baseline, management
   plane security baseline, application layer and infrastructure layer
   security baseline.

2.  Terminology

2.1.  Key Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.2.  Definition of Terms

   This document uses the terms defined in [I-D.draft-ietf-sacm-
   terminology].

3.  Tree Diagrams

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is as
   follows:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write) and "ro" state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node and "*"
      denotes a "list" and "leaf-list".

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

4.  Data Model Structure

   As the network infrastructure device, it makes decision of the
   forwarding path based on the IP/MAC address and sends the packet in
   data plane.The NP or ASIC are the main components for the data plane
   functions.

   This section describes the key data plane security baseline of the
   network infrastructure devices, and defines their specific data
   models.

4.1.  Layer 2 protection

   Mac table is the key resource in terms of layer 2 forwarding, also
   easily attacked by learning massive invalid mac address.  The mac
   limit function is to protect the mac table by limiting the maximum
   number of learned mac address in appointed interfaces.  The mac
   address is not learned and the packet is discarded when the up-limit
   is reached, and the alarm is created possibly.

   If the broadcast traffic is not suppressed in layer 2 network (i.e.,
   Ethernet), a great amount of network bandwidth is consumed by a great
   deal of broadcast traffic.  The network performance is degraded, even

   interrupting the communication.In such a case, configuring the
   broadcast traffic suppression on the device to ensure some bandwidth
   can be reserved for unicast traffic forwarding when broadcast traffic
   bursts across the network.It's flexible to configure the device to
   suppress broadcast, multicast, and unknown unicast traffic on an
   interface, a specified interface in a VLAN, a sub-interface, and over
   a virtual switch instance (VSI) pseudo wire (PW).

4.2.  ARP

   ARP security is set of functions to protect the ARP protocol and
   networks against malicious attacks so that the network communication
   keeps stable and important user information is protected, which
   mainly includes:

      ARP anti-spoofing functions: protect devices against spoofing ARP
      attack packets, improving the security and reliability of network
      communication.

      ARP anti-flooding functions: relieve CPU load and prevent the ARP
      table overflow, ensuring normal network operation.

4.3.  URPF

   Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (URPF) is a technology used to defend
   against network attacks based on source address spoofing.  Generally,
   upon receiving a packet, a router first obtains the destination IP
   address of the packet and then searches the forwarding table for a
   route to the destination address.  If the router finds such a route,
   it forwards the packet; otherwise, it discards the packet.  A URPF-
   enabled router, however, obtains the source IP address of a received
   packet and searches for a route to the source address.  If the router
   fails to find the route, it considers that the source address is a
   forged one and discards the packet.  In this manner, URPF can
   effectively protect against malicious attacks that are launched by
   changing the source addresses of packets.

   URPF can be performed in strict or loose mode.  The strict mode
   checks both the existence of source address in the route table and
   the interface consistency, while loose mode only checks if the source
   address is in the route table.  In some case, the router may have
   only one default route to the router of the ISP.  Therefore, matching
   the default route entry needs to be supported.

   URPF can be performed over interface, defined flow and traffic sent
   to local CPU.

4.4.  DHCP Snooping

   DHCP, which is widely used on networks, dynamically assigns IP
   addresses to clients and manages configuration information in a
   centralized manner.  During DHCP packet forwarding, some attacks may
   occur, such as bogus DHCP server attacks, DHCP exhaustion attacks,
   denial of service (DoS) attacks, and DHCP flooding attacks.

   DHCP snooping is a DHCP security feature that functions in a similar
   way to a firewall between DHCP clients and servers.  A DHCP-snooping-
   capable device intercepts DHCP packets and uses information carried
   in the packets to create a DHCP snooping binding table.  This table
   records hosts' MAC addresses, IP addresses, IP address lease time,
   VLAN, and interface information.  The device uses this table to check
   the validity of received DHCP packets.  If a DHCP packet does not
   match any entry in this table, the device discards the packet.

   Besides the binding table, DHCP snooping has other security features
   such as trusted interface, max dhcp user limit and whitelist to
   defend against the bogus DHCP server, DHCP flooding and other fine-
   grained DHCP attacks.

4.5.  CPU Protection

   For the network device, there are maybe a large number of packets to
   be sent to its CPU, or malicious packets attempt to attack the device
   CPU.  If the CPU receives excessive packets, it will be overloaded
   and support the normal services with very poor performance; In
   extreme cases, the system fails.

   More specifically, services are negatively affected when the CPU is
   attacked because of the following reasons:

   o  Valid protocol packets are not distinguished from invalid protocol
      packets.  The CPU is busy in processing a large number of invalid
      protocol packets.  Consequently, the CPU usage rises sharply and
      valid packets cannot be processed properly

   o  Packets of some protocols are sent to the CPU through the same
      channel.  When excessive packets of a certain type of protocol
      packet block the channel, the transmission of other protocol
      packets is affected

   o  The bandwidth of a channel is not set appropriately.  When an
      attack occurs, processing of protocol packets on other channels is
      affected

   Accordingly, the following countermeasures can be taken by the
   network device for CPU protection:

   o  Collect and classify protocols related to various services running
      on equipment

   o  Use ACLs to filter the packets.  Valid protocol packets are put
      into the whitelist and a user-defined flow, other packets are put
      into the blacklist

Internet-DraNetwork Infrastructure Device Data Plane Security  June 2018


   o  Plan the priorities, channel bandwidth, length of packets, and
      alarm function of the preceding three lists

   o  Disable services that are not deployed on the equipment, and
      control the total forwarding bandwidth

   In this manner, the number of packets sent to the CPU is under
   control, and the bandwidth is ensured preferentially for services
   with higher priorities.  In addition, CPU overload is prevented and
   an alarm is generated when an attack occurs.
