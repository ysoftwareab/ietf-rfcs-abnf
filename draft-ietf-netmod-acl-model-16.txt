Internet-Draft               ACL YANG model                February 2018


1.  Introduction

   Access Control List (ACL) is one of the basic elements used to
   configure device forwarding behavior.  It is used in many networking
   technologies such as Policy Based Routing, Firewalls etc.

   An ACL is an ordered-by-user set of rules that is used to filter
   traffic on a networking device.  Each rule is represented by an
   Access Control Entry (ACE).

   Each ACE has a group of match criteria and a group of action
   criteria.

   The match criteria consist of a tuple of packet header match criteria
   and can have metadata match criteria as well.

   o  Packet header matches apply to fields visible in the packet such
      as address or class of service or port numbers.

   o  In case vendor supports it, metadata matches apply to fields
      associated with the packet but not in the packet header such as
      input interface or overall packet length

   The actions specify what to do with the packet when the matching
   criteria is met.  These actions are any operations that would apply
   to the packet, such as counting, policing, or simply forwarding.  The
   list of potential actions is endless depending on the capabilities of
   the networked devices.

   Access Control List is also widely knowns as ACL (pronounce as [ak-uh
   l]) or Access List.  In this document, Access Control List, ACL and
   Access List are used interchangeably.

   The matching of filters and actions in an ACE/ACL are triggered only
   after application/attachment of the ACL to an interface, VRF, vty/tty
   session, QoS policy, routing protocols amongst various other config
   attachment points.  Once attached, it is used for filtering traffic
   using the match criteria in the ACE's and taking appropriate
   action(s) that have been configured against that ACE.  In order to
   apply an ACL to any attachment point other than an interface, vendors
   would have to augment the ACL YANG model.

2.  Problem Statement

   This document defines a YANG [RFC7950] data model for the
   configuration of ACLs.  It is very important that model can be used
   easily by applications/attachments.

   ACL implementations in every device may vary greatly in terms of the
   filter constructs and actions that they support.  Therefore this
   draft proposes a model that can be augmented by standard extensions
   and vendor proprietary models.

3.  Understanding ACL's Filters and Actions

   Although different vendors have different ACL data models, there is a
   common understanding of what Access Control List (ACL) is.  A network
   system usually have a list of ACLs, and each ACL contains an ordered
   list of rules, also known as Access Control Entries (ACE).  Each ACE
   has a group of match criteria and a group of action criteria.  The
   match criteria consist of packet header matching.  It as also
   possible for ACE to match on metadata, if supported by the vendor.
   Packet header matching applies to fields visible in the packet such
   as address or class of service or port numbers.  Metadata matching
   applies to fields associated with the packet, but not in the packet
   header such as input interface, packet length, or source or
   destination prefix length.  The actions can be any sort of operation
   from logging to rate limiting or dropping to simply forwarding.
   Actions on the first matching ACE are applied with no processing of
   subsequent ACEs.

   The model also includes a container to hold overall operational state
   for each ACL and operational state for each ACE.  One ACL can be
   applied to multiple targets within the device, such as interfaces of
   a networked device, applications or features running in the device,
   etc.  When applied to interfaces of a networked device, the ACL is

   applied in a direction which indicates if it should be applied to
   packet entering (input) or leaving the device (output).  An example
   in the appendix shows how to express it in YANG model.

   This draft tries to address the commonalities between all vendors and
   create a common model, which can be augmented with proprietary
   models.  The base model is simple and with this design we hope to
   achieve enough flexibility for each vendor to extend the base model.

   The use of feature statements in the model allows vendors to
   advertise match rules they are capable and willing to support.  There
   are two sets of feature statements a device needs to advertise.  The
   first set of feature statements specify the capability of the device.
   These include features such as "Device can support ethernet headers"
   or "Device can support of IPv4 headers".  The second set of feature
   statements specify the combinations of headers the device is willing
   to support.  These include features such as "Plain IPv6 ACL
   supported" or "Ethernet, IPv4 and IPv6 ACL combinations supported".

3.1.  ACL Modules

   There are two YANG modules in the model.  The first module, "ietf-
   access-control-list", defines generic ACL aspects which are common to
   all ACLs regardless of their type or vendor.  In effect, the module
   can be viewed as providing a generic ACL "superclass".  It imports
   the second module, "ietf-packet-fields".  The match container in
   "ietf-access-control-list" uses groupings in "ietf-packet-fields" to
   specify match fields such as port numbers or protocol.  The
   combination of if-feature checks and must statements allow for the
   selection of relevant match fields that a user can define rules for.

   If there is a need to define new "matches" choice, such as IPFIX
   [RFC5101], the container "matches" can be augmented.

   YANG Tree Diagrams [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-tree-diagrams].

4.  ACL YANG Models

4.1.  IETF Access Control List module

   "ietf-access-control-list" is the standard top level module for
   access lists.  The "access-lists" container stores a list of "acl".
   Each "acl" has information identifying the access list by a name
   ("name") and a list ("aces") of rules associated with the "name".
   Each of the entries in the list ("aces"), indexed by the string
   "name", has containers defining "matches" and "actions".

   The model defines several ACL types and actions in the form of
   identities and features.  Features are used by implementors to select
   the ACL types the system can support and identities are used to
   validate the types that have been selected.  These types are
   implicitly inherited by the "ace", thus safeguarding against
   misconfiguration of "ace" types in an "acl".

   The "matches" define criteria used to identify patterns in "ietf-
   packet-fields".  The choice statements within the match container
   allow for selection of one header within each of "l2", "l3", or "l4"
   headers.  The "actions" define behavior to undertake once a "match"
   has been identified.  In addition to permit and deny for actions, a
   logging option allows for a match to be logged that can be used to
   determine which rule was matched upon.  The model also defines the
   ability for ACL's to be attached to a particular interface.

   Statistics in the ACL can be collected for an "ace" or for an
   "interface".  The feature statements defined for statistics can be
   used to determine whether statistics are being collected per "ace",
   or per "interface".

<CODE ENDS>

4.2.  IETF Packet Fields module

   The packet fields module defines the necessary groups for matching on
   fields in the packet including ethernet, ipv4, ipv6, and transport
   layer fields.  The "type" node determines which of these fields get
   included for any given ACL with the exception of TCP, UDP and ICMP
   header fields.  Those fields can be used in conjunction with any of
   the above layer 2 or layer 3 fields.

   Since the number of match criteria is very large, the base draft does
   not include these directly but references them by "uses" to keep the
   base module simple.  In case more match conditions are needed, those
   can be added by augmenting choices within container "matches" in
   ietf-access-control-list.yang model.

   This module imports definitions from Common YANG Data Types [RFC6991]
   and references IP [RFC0791], ICMP [RFC0792], IPv6 [RFC2460],
   Definition of the Differentiated Services Field in the IPv4 and IPv6
   Headers [RFC2474], The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification
   (ECN) to IP [RFC3168], Robust Explicit Congestion Notification
   Signaling with Nonces [RFC3540], IPv6 Scoped Address Architecture
   [RFC4007], IPv6 Addressing Architecture [RFC4291], A Recommendation
   for IPv6 Address Text Representation [RFC5952].

   When a lower-port and an upper-port are both present, it represents a
   range between lower-port and upper-port with both the lower-port and
   upper-port are included.  When only a lower-port presents, it
   represents a single port.

5.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document is defines a schema for
   data that is designed to be accessed via network management protocol
   such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF
   layer is the secure transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement
   secure transport is SSH [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer is
   HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC5246].

   The NETCONF Access Control Model (NACM [RFC6536]) provides the means
   to restrict access for particular NETCONF users to a pre-configured
   subset of all available NETCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG module which are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., <edit-config>)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.

   These are the subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/
   vulnerability:

   /access-lists/acl/aces: This list specifies all the configured access
   control entries on the device.  Unauthorized write access to this
   list can allow intruders to access and control the system.
   Unauthorized read access to this list can allow intruders to spoof
   packets with authorized addresses thereby compromising the system.

6.  IANA Considerations

7.  Acknowledgements

   Alex Clemm, Andy Bierman and Lisa Huang started it by sketching out
   an initial IETF draft in several past IETF meetings.  That draft
   included an ACL YANG model structure and a rich set of match filters,
   and acknowledged contributions by Louis Fourie, Dana Blair, Tula
   Kraiser, Patrick Gili, George Serpa, Martin Bjorklund, Kent Watsen,
   and Phil Shafer.  Many people have reviewed the various earlier
   drafts that made the draft went into IETF charter.

   Dean Bogdanovic, Kiran Agrahara Sreenivasa, Lisa Huang, and Dana
   Blair each evaluated the YANG model in previous drafts separately,
   and then worked together to created a ACL draft that was supported by
   different vendors.  That draft removed vendor specific features, and
   gave examples to allow vendors to extend in their own proprietary
   ACL.  The earlier draft was superseded with this updated draft and
   received more participation from many vendors.

   Authors would like to thank Jason Sterne, Lada Lhotka, Juergen
   Schoenwalder, David Bannister, Jeff Haas, Kristian Larsson and Einar
   Nilsen-Nygaard for their review of and suggestions to the draft.

Appendix A.  Extending ACL model examples

A.1.  A company proprietary module example

   Module "example-newco-acl" is an example of company proprietary model
   that augments "ietf-acl" module.  It shows how to use 'augment' with
   an XPath expression to add additional match criteria, action
   criteria, and default actions when no ACE matches found.  All these
   are company proprietary extensions or system feature extensions.
   "example-newco-acl" is just an example and it is expected from
   vendors to create their own proprietary models.

   The following figure is the tree structure of example-newco-acl.  In
   this example, /ietf-acl:access-lists/ietf-acl:acl/ietf-acl:aces/ietf-
   acl:ace/ietf-acl:matches are augmented with two new choices,
   protocol-payload-choice and metadata.  The protocol-payload-choice
   uses a grouping with an enumeration of all supported protocol values.
   Metadata matches apply to fields associated with the packet but not
   in the packet header such as overall packet length.  In other
   example, /ietf-acl:access-lists/ietf-acl:acl/ietf-acl:aces/ietf-
   acl:ace/ietf-acl:actions are augmented with new choice of actions.

   Draft authors expect that different vendors will provide their own
   yang models as in the example above, which is the augmentation of the
   base model

A.2.  Linux nftables

   As Linux platform is becoming more popular as networking platform,
   the Linux data model is changing.  Previously ACLs in Linux were
   highly protocol specific and different utilities were used (iptables,
   ip6tables, arptables, ebtables), so each one had separate data model.
   Recently, this has changed and a single utility, nftables, has been
   developed.  With a single application, it has a single data model for
   filewall filters and it follows very similarly to the ietf-access-
   control list module proposed in this draft.  The nftables support
   input and output ACEs and each ACE can be defined with match and
   action.

   The example in Section 4.3 can be configured using nftable tool as
   below.

         nft add table ip filter
         nft add chain filter input
         nft add rule ip filter input ip protocol tcp ip saddr \
             10.10.10.1/24 drop

   The configuration entries added in nftable would be.

Internet-Draft               ACL YANG model                February 2018


         table ip filter {
           chain input {
             ip protocol tcp ip saddr 10.10.10.1/24 drop
           }
         }


   We can see that there are many similarities between Linux nftables
   and IETF ACL YANG data models and its extension models.  It should be
   fairly easy to do translation between ACL YANG model described in
   this draft and Linux nftables.

A.3.  Ethertypes

   The ACL module is dependent on the definition of ethertypes.  IEEE
   owns the allocation of those ethertypes.  This model is being
   included here to enable definition of those types till such time that
   IEEE takes up the task of publication of the model that defines those
   ethertypes.  At that time, this model can be deprecated.
