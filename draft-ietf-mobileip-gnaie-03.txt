   a new extension header format, that is intended to extend the Mobile
   IP extension address space. This document defines the Generalized
   Network Access Identifier (GNAI) extension, which SHOULD be used by

1.0 Introduction

   The Mobile IP Extensions Rationalization (MIER) specification [9]
   defines a new extension header format, that is intended to extend the
   Mobile IP extension address space. This document defines the
   Generalized Network Access Identifier (GNAI) extension, which SHOULD
   be used by any Mobile IP extension specifying an extension containing
   an NAI [2].

   This specification does not define a sub-type to carry a Mobile
   Node's NAI, since this is already defined in [1].


2.0  Generalized NAI Extension

   This section defines the generalized NAI Extension, used by any
   extension that must carry data in the format of an NAI [2].  This
   extension may be carried by Registration Request and Reply messages.

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     Type      |   Length      |   Sub-Type    |    NAI ...
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Type

      (Type to be assigned by IANA) (skippable) [3]

   Length

      8-bit unsigned integer. Length of the extension, in octets,
      excluding the extension Type and the extension Length fields.
      This field MUST be set to 1 plus the total length of the NAI
      field.

   Sub-Type

      This field describes the type of the entity which owns the NAI.
      The following subtypes are defined:

         1    HA_NAI
         2    FA_NAI

      When a mobile node or home agent adds a GNAI extension to a
      registration message, the extension MUST appear prior to any
      authentication extensions.

      In the event the Foreign Agent adds an GNAI extension to a
      registration message, the extension MUST appear prior to any
      authentication extensions added by the FA.

   NAI

      Contains the NAI [2] in a string format.


3.0  IANA Considerations

   The value assigned to the Generalized NAI extension, specified in
   section 2.0, MUST be assigned from the Mobile IP extension Type field
   defined in RFC 2002 [3]. This value MUST NOT conflict with any value
   assigned to RFC 2344 [5], RFC 2356 [6], RFC 3012 [7], RFC 2115 [8]
   and RFC 2794 [1].

   Section 2.0 introduces a new namespace that requires IANA management.
   This specification makes use of the values 1-2, and all other values
   other than zero (0) are available for assignment via IETF concensus
   [10].


4. Security Considerations

   This specification introduces new Mobile IP extensions that are used
   to carry mobility agent identities, in the form of Network Access
   Identifiers. It is assumed that the Mobile IP messages that would
   carry these extensions would be authenticated in the manner that is
   described in [3], or any follow-on authentication mechanisms.
   Therefore, this specification does not lessen the security of Mobile
   IP messages.

   It should be noted, that the identities sent in the extensions
   specified herein MAY be sent in the clear over the network.  However,
   the authors do not envision that this information would create any
