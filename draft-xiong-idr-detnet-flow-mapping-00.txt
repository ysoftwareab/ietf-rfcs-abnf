             BGP Flow Specification for DetNet Flow Mapping
                 draft-xiong-idr-detnet-flow-mapping-00

Abstract

   This document proposes extensions to BGP Flow Specification for the
   flow mapping of Deterministic Networking (DetNet) when interconnected
   with IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN).  The BGP flowspec is
   used for the filtering of the packets that match the DetNet newtworks
   and the mapping between TSN streams and DetNet flows in the control
   plane.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8655] specifies the architecture of Deterministic Networking
   (DetNet), which provide a capability for the delivery of data flows
   with extremely low packet loss rates and bounded end-to-end delivery
   latency.  DetNet-enabled end systems and DetNet nodes can be
   interconnected by sub-networks, i.e., Layer 2 technologies such as
   IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN).

   As defined in [RFC8655], the DetNet IP and MPLS flows can be carried
   over TSN sub-networks.  DetNet needs to be mapped to the sub-networks
   technology used to interconnect DetNet nodes.  For example, a TSN
   node may be used to interconnect DetNet-aware nodes, and these DetNet
   nodes can map DetNet flows to TSN streams.  When the Detnet provide
   the deterministic service for the TSN end system, a DetNet edge node
   may be used to interconnect the TSN end system, and the DetNet nodes
   can map the TSN streams to DetNet flows.

   As described in [RFC8938], one of the primary requirements of the
   DetNet Controller Plane is restricting flows to IEEE 802.1 TSN and
   the requirement could use the centralized network management
   provisioning mechanisms such as BGP protocol.  As defined in
   [RFC8955], the Flow Specifications for BGP is an n-tuple consisting
   of several matching criteria which is comprised of traffic filtering
   rules and is associated with actions that can be applied to the
   traffic flows.  The DetNet edge nodes can provide the capability to
   process the traffic including classifing, shaping, rate limiting,

   filtering, and redirecting packets based on the policies configured
   by the BGP Flow Specification.

   This document proposes extensions to BGP Flow Specification for the
   interconnection of DetNet and TSN.  The BGP flowspec is used for the
   filtering of the packets that match the DetNet newtworks and the
   mapping between TSN streams and DetNet flows in the control plane.

   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  The Flow Mapping of DetNet

   As described in [I-D.ietf-detnet-tsn-vpn-over-mpls], TSN networks can
   be interconnected over a DetNet MPLS Network.  And as discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip-over-tsn] and [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls-over-tsn],
   DetNet IP or MPLS networks can be operating over a TSN sub-network.
   The mapping between TSN Streams and DetNet flows is required for the
   service proxy function at DetNet Edge nodes.  And the mapping table
   can be configured and maintained in the control plane.  When a DetNet
   Edge Node receives a packet, it MUST identify and check whether such
   flow is present in its mapping table and decide to drop (when not
   match) or to forward the packet (when match) to the associated
   service. 1:1 and N:1 mapping (aggregating multiple TSN Streams in a
   single DetNet flow) MUST be supported.

   As Figure 1 shows, it is required to configue the identification
   information when mapping received TSN Streams to the DetNet flows at
   Edge Node-1.  Mechanisms and Parameters of TSN stream identification
   (e.g.,Mask-and-Match Stream identification) defined in [IEEE8021CB]
   and [IEEEP8021CBdb] can be used for service proxy function.  After
   the identification of the TSN stream, it need to map the packet to
   the DetNet flow information such as S-Label, d-CW when in DetNet MPLS
   data plane and handle the packet as defined in [RFC8964].

   When the DetNet Edge Node-2 receives a DetNet flow, it MUST identify
   the DetNet flow-ID information such as IP 6-tuple in DetNet IP data

   plane or S-Label and d-CW information in DetNet MPLS data plane.
   Then the Service proxy function need to map the DetNet flow-ID and
   flow related parameters to the associated TSN Stream IDs and streams
   related parameters.

   As defined in [RFC8955], the nodes that applied a Flow Specification
   can fillter the received pakects according to the matching criteria
   and can forward the flows based on the associated actions.  This
   document proposes extensions to BGP Flow Specification for the
   mapping of DetNet flows and TSN streams by using the traffic
   filtering rules to identify the packet and using the associated
   action to map the packet to the related service.

4.  BGP Extensions for Flow Specification Encoding

4.1.  Filtering Rules for TSN Streams

   As IEEE Std 802.1Q defined, a Stream ID is a 64-bit field that
   uniquely identifies a stream and can be generated by the system
   offering the stream, or possibly a device controlling that system.
   But it is not carried in the header of the TSN Stream.  As defined in
   [IEEE8021CB] and [IEEEP8021CBdb], five specific Stream identification
   functions are described: Null Stream identification, Source MAC and
   VLAN Stream identification, Active Destination MAC and VLAN Stream

   identification, and IP Stream identification, and Mask-and-match
   Stream identification.  It needs to examines the header of the
   streams such as destination_address, vlan_identifier, IP source
   address, IP destination address, DSCP, IP next protocol, source port,
   destination port and mac_service_data_unit.

   As defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-flowspec-l2vpn], the Ethernet Layer 2
   (L2) related fields has been covered by the L2 traffic filtering
   rules except the mac_service_data_unit in Mask-and-Match Stream
   identification.  A mac_service_data_unit mask is defined to identify
   communication flows supported by various higher-layer protocols.
   This document proposes a new type in L2 components flowspec Type for
   TSN Streams.

   Type TBD1 - Mac Service Data Unit

   Encoding: <type (1 octet), length (1 octet), [op, value]+>

   Defines a list of {operation, value} pairs used to match 6-octet Mac
   Service Data Unit field.  Values are encoded as 6-octet quantities.
   op is encoded as specified in Section 4.2.1.1 of [RFC8955].

4.2.  Traffic Action for TSN Streams

   The action for an TSN traffic filtering flowspec is to accept the TSN
   streams that matches that particular rule and map the streams to the
   DetNet flows.  The action for L3 traffic with extended communities
   types per [RFC8955] and [RFC8956] such as traffic-rate, traffic-
   marking, traffic-action, and redirect can be used for TSN to DetNet
   IP flow mapping.

   The DetNet flow is identified by a S-Label and the DetNet Header
   consists of d-CW and F-Labels.  The MPLS label related action for an
   TSN stream mapping to a DetNet MPLS network can use the Label-action
   defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-flowspec-label].  And the action for the
   sequence in d-CW field, this document specifies the following BGP
   extended communitiy for TSN Streams as following shown.

   sequence number.

4.3.  Filtering Rules for DetNet Flows

   The L3 traffic filtering rules defined in [RFC8955] and [RFC8956] can
   be used for DetNet IP flow.

   As defined in RFC8964, the MPLS-based DetNet data plane encapsulation
   consists of d-CW, S-Label and F-Labels.  The MPLS label filtering
   rules have been defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-flowspec-mpls-match].

   This document proposes a new community type in L3 components flowspec
   Type for DetNet MPLS flows.

   Type TBD3 - d-CW

   Encoding: <type (1 octet), length (1 octet), [op, value]+>

   Defines a list of {operation, value} pairs used to match Sequence.
   Values are encoded as 4-octet quantities, where the four most
   significant bits are set to zero and ignored for matching and the 28
   least significant bits contain the sequence value. op is encoded as
   specified in Section 4.2.1.1 of [RFC8955].
