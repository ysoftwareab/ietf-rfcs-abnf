1.  Introduction

   To allow automatic device configuration to a DNS64 process behind a
   IPv6-only link it is necessary to provide AAAA and A record exclusion
   lists.  This document provide such a mechanism.

   When an DNS64 implementation needs to be configured behind DNS64
   server, for example when performing DNSSEC [RFC4034] validation, the
   AAAA exclusion list from [RFC6147] needs to be made available.  When
   the DNS64 implementation implementation is also on a local dual-stack
   network the local A records also need to be excluded from DNS64
   processing to prevent local traffic being sent to the NAT64.

1.1.  Reserved Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  DNS64-EXCLUDE Option

   The DNS64-EXLUDE option (TBA) contains a DNS wire encoded name
   [RFC1034] which points at 1 or 2 APL records [RFC3123] where the
   records contain IPv4 and IPv6 exclusions lists which are encoded on a
   first match basis.  If there are multiple records prefixes for a
   address family MUST NOT be split across multiple records as DNS
   records are not ordered.

   The IPv6 prefixes are used to populate the AAAA exclusion list from
   [RFC6147] Section 5.1.4.

   The IPv4 prefixes are used to exclude A records from translation to
   DNS64 mapped AAAA records.

3.  Examples

   dns64.example.com. IN APL !1:10.0.0/24 1:10/8 2:64:ff9b::/32

                               Single Record

   dns64.example.com. IN APL !1:10.0.0/24 1:10/8
   dns64.example.com. IN APL 2:64:ff9b::/32

                             Multiple Records

   Exclude 10.0.0.0/8 except for 10.0.0.0/24 from DNS64 processing.

   Exclude the well known DNS64 prefix 64:ff9b::/32 from DNS64
   processing.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to assign a new IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Option
   type for the DNS64-EXCLUDE option defined in this document.

   +----------------------+-------+
   | Option Name          | Type  |
   +----------------------+-------+
   | DNS64-EXCLUDE option | (TBD) |
   +----------------------+-------+

   The IANA registry for these options is:

5.  Security Considerations
