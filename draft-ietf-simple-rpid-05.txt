Abstract

   The Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) defines a basic format
   for representing presence information for a presentity.  That format



Schulzrinne, et al.     Expires August 19, 2004                 [Page 1]

Internet-Draft                    RPID                     February 2004


   defines a textual note, an indication of availability (open or
   closed) and a Universal Resource Identifier (URI) for communication.
   The Rich Presence Information Data Format (RPID) described here is an
   extension that adds optional elements to the Presence Information
   Data Format (PIDF).  These extensions provide additional information
   about the presentity and its contacts.  The information is designed
   so that much of it can be derived automatically, e.g., from calendar
   files or user activity.

   This extension includes information about what the person is doing, a
   grouping identifier for a tuple, when a service or device was last
   used, the type of place a person is in, what media might be private,
   the relationship of a service tuple to another presentity, the
   person's mood, the time zone it is located in, the type of service it
   offers and the overall role of the presentity.

   These extensions include characteristics and status information for
   person, service (tuple) and devices.

1.  Introduction

   The Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) definition [7] describes
   a basic presence information data format, encoded as an Extensible
   Markup Language (XML) document, for exchanging presence information
   in CPIM-compliant systems.  It consists of a <presence> root element,
   zero or more <tuple> elements carrying presence information including
   a Universal Resource Identifier (URI) for communication.  zero or
   more <note> elements and zero or more extension elements from other
   name spaces.  Each tuple defines a basic status of either "open" or
   "closed".

   However, it is frequently useful to convey additional information
   about a user that needs to be interpreted by an automata, and is
   therefore not appropriate to be placed in the <note> element of the
   PIDF document.  Therefore, this specification defines extensions to
   the PIDF document format for conveying richer presence information.
   Generally, the extensions have been chosen to provide features common
   in existing presence systems at the time of writing, in addition to
   elements that could readily be derived automatically from existing
   sources of presence, such as calendaring systems or communication
   devices, or sources describing the user's current physical
   environment.

   The presence data model [12] defines the concepts of service, device,
   and person as the data elements that are used to model the state of a
   presentity.  Services are encoded using the <tuple> element, defined
   in PIDF; devices and persons are represented by the <device> and
   <person> XML elements, respectively, defined in the the data model
   [12].  However, neither PIDF nor the data model define presence
   attributes beyond the <basic> status element.

   This specification defines additional presence attributes to describe
   person, service and device data elements, summarized as "Rich
   Presence Information Data Format for Presence" (RPID).  These
   attributes are specified by XML elements which extend the PIDF
   <tuple> element and the <device> and <person> elements defined in the
   data model.

   This extension has two main goals:

   1.  Provide rich presence information that is at least as powerful as
       common commercial presence systems.  Such feature-parity
       simplifies transition to CPIM-compliant systems, both in terms of
       user acceptance and protocol conversion.
   2.  Maintain backwards-compatibility with PIDF, so that PIDF-only
       watchers and gateways can continue to function properly,
       naturally without access to the functionality described here.

   We make no assumptions how the information in the RPID elements is
   generated.  Experience has shown that users are not always diligent
   about updating their presence status.  Thus, we want to make it as
   easy as possible to derive RPID information from other information
   sources, such as personal calendars, the status of communication
   devices such as telephones, typing activity and physical presence
   detectors as commonly found in energy-management systems.

   Many of the elements correspond to data commonly found in personal
   calendars.  Thus, we attempted to align some of the extensions with
   the usage found in calendar formats such as iCal [10].

   The information in a presence document can be generated by a single
   entity or can be composed from information published by multiple
   entities.

   Note that PIDF documents and this extension can be used in two
   different contexts, namely by the presentity to publish its presence
   status and by the presence server to notify some set of watchers.
   The presence server MAY compose, translate or filter the published
   presence state before delivering customized presence information to
   the watcher.  For example, it may merge presence information from
   multiple PUAs, remove whole elements, translate values in elements or
   remove information from elements.  Mechanisms that filter calls and
   other communications to the presentity can subscribe to this presence
   information just like a regular watcher and in turn generate
   automated rules, such as scripts [11], that govern the actual
   communications behavior of the presentity.  Details are described in
   the data model document.

   Since RPID is a PIDF XML document, it also uses the content type
   application/pidf+xml.

2.  Terminology and Conventions

   This memo makes use of the vocabulary defined in the IMPP Model
   document [5].  Terms such as CLOSED, INSTANT MESSAGE, OPEN, PRESENCE
   SERVICE, PRESENTITY, WATCHER, and WATCHER USER AGENT in the memo are
   used in the same meaning as defined therein.

   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT,
   RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be interpreted
   as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1].

3.1  Overview

   Some of the RPID elements describe services, some devices, and some
   the person.  As such, they either extend <tuple>, <device> or
   <person>, respectively.  Furthermore, some are dynamic status
   information, and others describe more static characteristics, and
   thus may extend <status> or the root <tuple>, <device> or <person>
   elements.

   Below, we summarize the RPID elements.  The next sections will then
   provide more detailed descriptions.
   activities: The <activities> status element describes what the person
      is doing, using an enumeration of <activity> elements.
   class: An identifier that groups similar person elements, devices or
      services.
   device-id: A device identifier references a <device> element,
      indicating that this device contributes to the service described
      by the tuple.
   mood: The <mood> status element indicates the mood of the person.
   place-is: The <place-is> status elements reports on the properties,
      such as light and noise, the person is in.
   place-type: The <place-type> status elements reports the type of
      place the person is located in.
   privacy: The <privacy> element distinguishes whether the
      communication service is likely to be observable by other parties.
   relationship: When a service is likely to reach a user besides the
      person associated with the presentity, the relationship indicates
      how that user relates to the person.  Relationship is a
      characteristic.
   service-type: The <service-type> element describes whether the
      service is delivered electronically, is a postal or delivery
      service or describes in-person communications.
   sphere: The <sphere> element characterizes the overall role of the
      presentity.
   status-icon: The <status-icon> element depicts the current status of
      the person.
   time-offset: The <time-offset> status element quantifies the time
      zone the person is in, expressed as the number of minutes away
      from UTC.
   user-input: The <user-input> element records the user-input or usage
      state of the service or device, based on human user input.

   The usage of these elements within the <person>, <tuple> and <device>
   elements is shown in Table Table 1.  An 'x' in the respective column
   indicates that the RPID element MAY appear as a child of that
   element.

                                Table 1

   In general, it is unlikely that a presentity will publish or announce
   all of these elements at the same time.  Rather, these elements were
   chosen to give the presentity maximum flexibility in deriving this
   information from existing sources, such as calendaring tools, device
   activity sensors or location trackers, as well as to manually
   configure this information.

   The namespace URIs for these elements defined by this specification
   are URNs [2], using the namespace identifier 'ietf' defined by [4]
   and extended by [6]:

      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:status:rpid-status
      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:rpid-tuple
      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:rpid-person
      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:rpid-device

   This document uses a separate namespace for extending the PIDF
   <status> namespace, in accordance with Sections 4.2.5 and 4.3.2 of
   [7].

   All elements described in this document are optional.

   The elements marked with the value 'x' in Table  MAY be qualified
   with the 'since' and 'until' attributes to describe the absolute time
   when the element assumed this value and the absolute time until which
   is element is expected to be valid.  The 'since' time MUST be in the
   past, the 'until' time in the future relative to the time of
   publication of the presence information and, if available, the PIDF

   <timestamp> element.

   All elements may be generated either automatically, derived from
   sensor information or a calendar, or provided manually, via some user
   interface, by the presentity.  In either case, there is no guarantee
   that the information is accurate, as users forget to update calendars
   or may not always adjust the presence information manually.

3.2  Activities Element

   The <activities> element describes what the person is currently
   doing, expressed as an enumeration of activity-describing elements.
   A person can be engaged in multiple activities at the same time,
   e.g., traveling and having a meal.  This can be quite helpful to the
   watcher in judging how appropriate a communication attempt is and
   which means of communications is most likely to succeed and not annoy
   the person.  The activity indications correspond roughly to the
   category field in calendar entries, such as Section 4.8.1.2 of RFC
   2445 [10].

   An activities enumeration consists of one or more elements using
   values drawn from the list below, any other token string or
   IANA-registered values (Section 6).

   If a person publishes an activity of "perment-absence", it is likely
   that all services will report a status of CLOSED.  In general,
   services MAY advertise either service status for any activity value.

   away: The person is physically away from all interactive
      communication devices location.  This activity was included since
      it can often be derived automatically from security systems,
      energy management systems or entry badge systems.  While this
      activity would typically be associated with a status of CLOSED
      across all services, a person may declare itself away to
      discourage communication, but indicate that it still can be
      reached if needed, but communications might reach an answering
      service, for example.
   appointment: The person has a calendar appointment, without
      specifying exactly of what type.  This activity is indicated if
      more detailed information is not available or the person chooses
      not to reveal more information.
   busy: User is busy, without further details.  While this activity
      would typically be associated with a status of CLOSED across all
      services, a person may declare itself busy to discourage
      communication, but indicate that it still can be reached if
      needed.

Internet-Draft                    RPID                     February 2004


   holiday: This is a scheduled national or local holiday.  This
      information can typically be derived automatically from calendars.
   in-transit: The person is riding in a vehicle, such as a car, but not
      steering.  The <place-type> element provides more specific
      information about the type of conveyance the person is using.
   meal: The person is scheduled for a meal.  This activity category can
      often be generated automatically from a calendar.
   meeting: A meeting is a sub-class of an appointment.  This activity
      category can often be generated automatically from a calendar.
   on-the-phone: The person is talking on the telephone.  This activity
      is included since it can often be derived automatically.
   performance: A performance is a sub-class of an appointment and
      includes musical, theatrical and cinematic performances as well as
      lectures.  It is distinguished from a meeting by the fact that the
      person may either be lecturing or be in the audience, with a
      potentially large number of other people, making interruptions
      particularly noticeable.  This activity category can often be
      generated automatically from a calendar.
   permanent-absence: person will not return for the foreseeable future,
      e.g., because it is no longer working for the company.  This
      activity is associated with a status of CLOSED across all
      services.
   sleeping: This activity category can often be generated automatically
      from a calendar, local time information or biometric data.
   steering: The person is controlling a vehicle, ship or plane.
   travel: The person is on a business or personal trip, but not
      necessarily in-transit.  This category can often be generated
      automatically from a calendar.
   vacation: Leisure travel.  This activity category can often be
      generated automatically from a calendar.

   The <activities> element MAY be qualified with the 'since' and
   'until' attributes as described in Section 3.

   If the entity described by a tuple is involved in multiple activities
   at the same time, the <activities> element enumerates all unique
   values as child <activity> elements.

   The <activities> element can be extended by adding elements from
   other namespaces, e.g., to reflect activities appropriate for a
   particular occupation.

3.3  Class Element

   The <class> element describes the class of the service, device or
   person.  Multiple elements can have the same class name within a
   presence document.  The naming of classes is left to the presentity.
   The presentity can use this information to group similar services,

   agent can use for filtering or authorization.

   The <device-id> element references the device that provides a
   particular service.  One service can be provided by multiple devices,
   so that each service tuple may contain zero or more <device-id>
   elements.  There is no significance in the order of these elements.

   The <device-id> element generally contains a URN.  It is only used
   for identification and matching and conveys no further substantive
   information.  The choice of URN is beyond the scope of this document.
   Such URNs SHOULD remain the same for the same physical device across
   time even if the device is rebooted or acquires a different network
   address.  [TBD: should urn:mac: and urn:esn: be registered?]

   The <device-id> element MUST NOT be qualified with the 'since' and
   'until' attributes as described in Section 3.

3.5  Mood Element

   The <mood> element describes the mood of the presentity.  They are
   enumerated chosen by the presentity.  The mood itself is provided as
   the element name of a defined child element of the <mood/> element
   (e.g., <happy/>); one such child element is REQUIRED.  The user MAY
   also specify a natural-language description of, or reason for, the
   mood in the <text/> child of the  element, which is OPTIONAL.  (This
   definition follows the Jabber Extension JEP-107.) It is RECOMMENDED
   that an implementation support the mood values proposed in Jabber
   Extension JEP-0107, which in turn are a superset of the Wireless
   Village [14] mood values and the values enumerated in the Affective
   Knowledge Representation that has been defined by Lisetti [13]:
      afraid
      amazed
      angry
      annoyed
      anxious
      ashamed
      bored
      brave
      calm
      cold
      confused
      contented
      cranky

3.6  Place-is Element

   The <place-is> element describes properties of the place the person
   is currently at.  This offers the watcher an indication what kind of
   communication is likely to be successful.  We define an initial set
   of values below:

   bright: The person is in a bright place, sufficient for good
      rendering on video.
   dark: The person is in a dark place, and thus may not be rendered
      well on video.
   noisy: The person is in a place with lots of background noise.
   quiet: The person is in a place such as a library, restaurant,
      place-of-worship, or theater that discourages noise, conversation
      and other distractions.

   This list can be augmented by free-text values in a note or
   additional IANA-registered values (Section 6).

   The <place-is> element contains other elements, e.g.,
      <place-is><noisy /></place-is>

   The <place-is> element MAY be qualified with the 'since' and 'until'
   attributes as described in Section 3.

3.7  Place-type Element

   The <place-type> element describes the type of place the person is
   currently at.  This offers the watcher an indication what kind of
   communication is likely to be appropriate.  We define an initial set
   of values below:

   aircraft: The person is in a plane, helicopter or balloon.
   airport: The person is located in an airport, heliport or similar
      location.
   bus: The person is travling in a public or charter bus.
   car: The person is in an automobile.
   convention center: The person is in a convention center.
   home: The person is in a private or residential setting, not
      necessarily the personal residence of the person, e.g., including
      hotel or a friend's home.
   hotel: The person is in a hotel, motel, inn or other lodging
      establishment.
   industrial: The person is in an industrial setting, such as a
      manufacturing floor or power plant.

   library: The person is in a library or other public place that
      provides access to books, music and reference materials.
   mall: The person is frequenting a shopping mall or shopping area.
   office: The person is in a business setting, such as an office.
   outdoors: The person is in a general outdoors area, such as a park or
      city streets.
   public: The person is in a public area such as a shopping mall,
      street, park, public building, train station, airport or in public
      conveyance such as a bus, train, plane or ship.  This general
      description encompasses the more precise descriptors "street",
      "public-transport", "aircraft", "ship", "bus", "train", "airport",
      "mall" and "outdoors" below.
   public-transport: The person is using any form of public transport,
      including aircraft, bus, train or ship.
   restaurant: The person is in a restaurant, coffee shop or other
      public dining establishment.
   school: The person is in a school or university, but not necessarily
      in a classroom or library.
   ship: The person is traveling in a water vessel or boat.
   station: The person is located in a bus or train station.
   street: The person is walking in a street.
   theater: The person is in a theater, lecture hall, auditorium, class
      room, movie theater or similar facility designed for
      presentations, talks, plays, music performances and other events
      involving an audience.
   train: The person is traveling in a train, monorail, maglev, cable
      car or similar conveyance.
   truck: The person is in a truck, used primarily to carry goods rather
      than people.

   This list can be augmented by free-text values or additional
   IANA-registered values (Section 6).

   The <place-type> element is a tokenlist, e.g.,
      <place-type>street public</place-type>

   The <place-type> element MAY be qualified with the 'since' and
   'until' attributes as described in Section 3.


3.8  Privacy Element

   The <privacy> element indicates which type of communication third
   parties in the vicinity of the presentity are unlikely to be able to
   intercept accidentally or intentionally.  This does not in any way
   describe the privacy properties of the electronic communication
   channel, e.g., properties of the encryption algorithm of the network
   protocol used.

   audio: Audio communication is likely only to be heard by the intended
      recipient.
   video: Inappropriate individuals are not likely to see video
      communications.
   text: Inappropriate individuals are not likely to see text
      communications.

      The <privacy> element can be used by logic executing on the
      watcher or by a composer to filter, sort and label tuples.  For
      example, a composer may have rules that limit the publication of
      tuples labeled as "private" to a select subset of the watchers.

   The <privacy> element MAY be qualified with the 'since' and 'until'
   attributes as described in Section 3.

3.9  Relationship Element

   The <relationship> element extends <tuple> and designates the type of
   relationship an alternate contact has with the presentity.  This
   element is provided only if the tuple refers to somebody other than
   the presentity.  Relationship values include "family", "associate"
   (e.g., for a colleague), "assistant", "supervisor".  Other free-text
   values and additional IANA-registered values (Section 6) can be used
   as well.

   If a relationship is indicated, the URI in the <contact> element
   refers to the entity, such as the assistant, that has a relationship
   to the presentity, not the presentity itself.

   Like tuples without a <relationship> qualifier, the <contact> element
   for tuples labeled with a relationship can contain either a
   communication URI such as "im", "sip", "sips", "h323", "tel" or
   "mailto", or a presence URI, such as "pres" or "sip".

3.10  Service Class

   The <service-class> element extends <tuple> and designates the type
   of service offered, namely electronic, delivery (including courier),
   postal or in-person.  Electronic service is implied if omitted.  The
   service types 'postal', 'delivery' and 'in-person' MUST NOT be used
   unless the contact URI is empty.  Additional data elements defined
   elsewhere describe the physical service delivery address for the
   in-person, postal or delivery services.  Such addresses might be
   specified in geospatial coordinates, civic addresses or some
   specialized address format, e.g., for interstellar addresses or a
   company-specific delivery system.

3.11  Sphere Element

   The <sphere> element designates the current state and role that the
   person plays.  For example, it might describe whether the person is
   in a work mode or at home or participating in activities related to
   some other organization such as the IETF or a church.  This document
   does not define names for these spheres except for two common ones,
   "work" and "home".

   Spheres are likely to be used for two purposes:  they allow the
   person to easily turn on or off certain rules that depend on what
   groups of people should be made aware of the person's status.  For
   example, if the person is a Boy Scout leader, he might set the sphere
   to "scouting" and then have a rule set that allows other scout
   masters in his troop to see his presence status.  As soon as he
   switches his status to "work" or "home" or some other sphere, the
   fellow scouts would lose access.

   The <sphere> element MAY be qualified with the 'since' and 'until'
   attributes as described in Section 3.

3.12  Status-Icon Element

   The <status-icon> element includes a URI pointing to an image (icon)
   representing the current status of the person or service.  The
   watcher MAY use this information to represent the status in a
   graphical user interface.  Presentities SHOULD provide images of
   sizes and aspect ratios that are appropriate for rendering as an
   icon.  Support for JPEG, PNG and GIF formats is RECOMMENDED.

   Watchers resolving the URI MUST validate whether the local copy of
   the icon is current when receiving a notification, using the standard
   cache control mechanism in the URI-identified retrieval protocol.

3.13  Time Offset

   The <time-offset> element describes the number of minutes of offset
   from UTC at the user's current location.  A positive number indicates
   that the local time-of-day is ahead (i.e., east of) Universal Time,
   while a negative number indicates that the local time-of-day is
   behind (i.e., west of) Universal Time.  Since daylight savings time
   adjustment may temporarily cause a difference between the true offset
   from UTC and the time offset element.

   An optional attribute, description, can be used to describe the
   offset, e.g., by labeling the time zone.  This description is meant
   for human consumption.

   Publishers on mobile devices SHOULD NOT publish this information
   unless they know the time offset information to reflect the current
   location.  (For example, many laptop users do not update their time
   zone when traveling.) Publishers SHOULD update the information
   whenever they discover that their UTC offset has changed.

3.14  User-Input Element

   The <user-input> element records the user-input or usage state of the
   service or device, based on human user input, e.g., keyboard,
   pointing device or voice.  If contained in a <person> element, it
   summarize any user input activity across all services and devices
   operated by the presentity.  The mechanism for such aggregation is
   beyond the scope of this document, but generally reflects the most
   recent user input across all devices and services.  The element can
   assume one of two values, namely 'active' or 'idle', with an optional
   'since' attribute that records when the last user input has been
   received.  An optional 'idle-threshold' element records how long the
   presentity will wait before reporting the service or device to be
   idle, measured in seconds.

   (A two-state model was chosen since it would otherwise be necessary
   to send repeated last-input updates during continuous activity.)

   A service that wants to indicate user input activity sends a
   <user-input> 'active' indication when the user has provided user
   input within a configurable interval of time, the idle-threshold.  If
   the user ceases to provide input and the idle threshold has elapsed,
   the tuple is marked with a <user-input> 'idle' indication instead,
   optionally including the time of last activity in the 'since'
   attribute.  An example is below:

     <user-input idle-threshold="600"
       since="2004-10-21T13:20:00.000-05:00">active</user-input>

   Depending on device or service capabilities, user input may be
   detected only for a particular application, i.e., when the
   application has user focus or when a user has sent a message or
   placed a call, or can be based on user input across all applications
   running on one end system.

   The <user-input> element may be used by a watcher, typically in
   combination with other data, to estimate how likely a user is to
   answer when contacting the service.  A tuple that has not been used
   in a while may still be OPEN, but a watcher may choose to first
   contact a URI in a tuple that is both OPEN and has been used more
   recently.

Internet-Draft                    RPID                     February 2004


   The <user-input> attribute can be omitted if the presentity wants to
   indicate that the device has not been used for a while, but does not
   want to reveal the precise duration, as in:

     <user-input>idle</user-input>

   Configuration MUST include the option to omit the 'since' attribute.

4.  Example

   The example below describes the presentity
   'pres:someone@example.com', which has a SIP contact,
   'sip:someone@example.com', representing a service.  It also has a
   device contact, as an email box.  The presentity is in a meeting, in
   a public office setting.  The 'until' information indicates that he
   will be there until 5.30 pm GMT.  The presentity also has an
   assistant, sip:secretary@example.com, who happens to be available for
   communications.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document calls for IANA to:

   o  register two new XML namespace URNs per [6];
   o  establish registries for <activities> (Section 3.2), <mood>
      (Section 3.5) <place-type> (Section 3.7), <privacy> (Section 3.8,
      and <relationship> (Section 3.9) categories.

   Note that this document does not need a new content type.  It
   inherits the content type from [7], namely application/pidf+xml.

6.1  URN Sub-Namespace Registration for
    'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:status:rpid-status'

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:status:rpid-status
   Description: This is the XML namespace for XML elements defined by
      RFCXXXX [RFC editor:  replace with RFC number] to describe rich
      presence information extensions for the status element in the PIDF
      presence document format in the application/pidf+xml content type.

6.5  Token Registrations

   This document creates new IANA registries for RPID elements:

   activities: See Section 3.2
   mood: See Section 3.5
   place-type: See Section 3.7
   privacy: See Section 3.8
   relationship: See Section 3.9

   All are XML tokens.  Registered tokens must be documented at the time
   of registration, as most descriptions are expected to be brief.

Internet-Draft                    RPID                     February 2004


   Following the policies outline in RFC 2434 [3], these tokens are
   assigned after Expert Review by the SIMPLE working group or its
   designated successor.  Each registration must include the name of the
   token and a brief description similar to the ones offered in for the
   initial registrations contained this document:

   Name of token: XML token describing the contact type, place type,
      privacy or relationship.
   Description: Brief description indicating the meaning of the token.

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [7] apply, as well as [8].  Compared
   to PIDF, this presence document format reveals additional information
   that can be highly sensitive.  Beyond traditional security measures
   to protect confidentiality and integrity, systems should offer a
   means to selectively reveal information to particular watchers and to
   inspect the information that is being published, particularly if it
   is generated automatically from other sources, such as calendars or
   sensors.
