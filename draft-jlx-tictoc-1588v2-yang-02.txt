1. Introduction

   As a synchronization protocol, IEEE 1588v2 [IEEE1588] is widely
   supported in the carrier networks. It can provide high precision
   time synchronization as high as nano-seconds. The protocol depends
   on a Precision Time Protocol (PTP) engine to automatically decide
   its state, and a PTP transportation layer to carry the PTP timing
   and various quality messages. The configuration parameters and
   state data sets of IEEE 1588v2 are numerous.

   Some work on IEEE 1588v2 MIB [PTP-MIB] is in progress in the IETF
   TICTOC WG. But the work is only scoped with retrieval of the state
   data of IEEE 1588v2 by Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
   and configuration is not considered, thus its use is limited.

   Some service providers require the management of the IEEE 1588v2
   synchronization network can be more flexible and more Internet-
   based (typically overlaid on their transport networks). Software
   Defined Network (SDN) is another driving factor which demands a
   greater control over synchronization networks.

Internet-Draft            1588v2 YANG Model               October 2015


   YANG [RFC6020] is a data modeling language used to model
   configuration and state data manipulated by the Network
   Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) [RFC6241]. A small set of built-in
   data types are defined in [RFC6020], and a collection of common
   data types are further defined in [RFC6991]. Advantages of YANG
   include Internet based configuration capability, validation, roll-
   back and etc., all these characteristics make it attractive to
   become a modeling language for IEEE 1588v2.

   This document defines a YANG [RFC6020] data model for the
   configuration of IEEE 1588v2 devices and clocks, and also retrieval
   of the state data of IEEE 1588v2 clocks.

   In order to fulfill the need of a lightweight implementation, the
   core module is designed to be generic and minimal, but be
   extensible with capability negotiation. That is, if a node is
   verified with a capability of more functions, then more modules can
   be loaded on demand, otherwise, only a basic module is loaded on
   the node.

   This document defines PTP system information, PTP data sets and
   running states following the structure and definitions in IEEE
   1588v2, and compatible with [PTP-MIB]. The router specific 1588v2
   information is out of scope of this document.

4. IEEE 1588V2 YANG Model hierarchy

   This section describes the hierarchy of IEEE 1588v2 YANG module.
   Query and retrieval of device wide or port specific configuration
   information and clock data set is described for this version.

   Query and retrieval of clock information include:

   - Clock data set attributes in a clock node, including: current-DS,
   clock-parent-DS, default-DS, time-properties-DS, and
   transparentClock-default-DS.

   - Port specific data set attributes, including: port-DS and
   transparentClock-port-DS.

6. Security Considerations

   YANG modules are designed to be accessed via the NETCONF protocol
   [RFC6241], thus security considerations in [RFC6241] apply here.
   Security measures such as using the NETCONF over SSH [RFC6242] and
   restricting its use with access control [RFC6536] can further
   improve its security, avoid injection attacks and misuse of the
   protocol.

   Some data nodes defined in this YANG module are writable, and any
   changes to them may adversely impact a synchronization network.

7. IANA Considerations

   This document registers a URI in the IETF XML registry, and the
   following registration is requested to be made:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:1588v2

   This document registers a YANG module in the YANG Module Names:

   name: 1588v2 namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:1588v2
