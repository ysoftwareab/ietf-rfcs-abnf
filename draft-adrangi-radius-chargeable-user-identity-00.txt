   Internet Draft   RADIUS Chargeable User Identity       7 Sept 2004

   1. Introduction  
    
     In certain authentication methods such as, EAP-PEAP or EAP-TTLS, 
     EAP-SIM, and EAP-AKA, the true identity of the subscriber can be 
     hidden from the RADIUS AAA servers outside the subscriberÆs home 
     network.  In these methods the User-Name(1) attribute contains an 
     anonymous identity (e.g., anonymous@example.com) sufficient to 
     route the RADIUS packets to the home network but otherwise 
     insufficient to identify the subscriber.  While this mechanism is 
     good practice there are situations where this creates problems:  
      
     -     In certain roaming situations intermediaries and visited 
     network require to be able to correlate an authentication session 
     with a user identity known to the userÆs home network for fraud 
     detection and revenue assurance.  For example, a broker may 
     require to implement a policy where by only one session is allowed 
     per user entity, or third party billing brokers may require to 
     match accounting records to a user identity. 
      
     -     NAS may require to match the user session and accounting 
     records to a user identity known to the userÆs home network for 
     future use û for example, charging dispute. 
      
     This basically implies that a unique identity known by the home 
     network needs to be conveyed to all parties involved in the 
     roaming transaction. 
      
     Providing a unique identity to intermediaries is therefore a 
     requirement to fulfill certain business needs.  This fulfillment 
     need not undermine the need to protect the anonymity of the user.  
     The mechanism provided by this draft allows the home operator to 
     meet these business requirements by providing a temporal identity 
     representing the subscriber and at the same time protecting the 
     anonymity of the subscriber. 
      
     Standard RADIUS Class(25) or User-Name(1) attributes could be used 
     to indicate the CUI.  However, in a complex global roaming 
     environment where there could be one or more intermediary between 
     the NAS and the home RADIUS server, the use of aforementioned 
     attributes could lead to problems as described below. 
      
      
        O RADIUS Class (25) is intended to be opaque to entities 
        outside the home network.  It is known and interpreted by the 
        home RADIUS server.  This combined with the fact that there 
        could be multiple class attributes or it could contain other 
        data than a chargeable identity, would make it impossible for

   Internet Draft   RADIUS Chargeable User Identity       7 Sept 2004 
               
 
        the entities outside the home network to identify which class 
        attributes contains a chargeable identity. 
      
      
        O Use of RADIUS UserName(1) would be a problem, because it 
        could be rewritten by the intermediaries.  Furthermore, 
        subsequent accounting request may fail to route through the 
        intermediary exchanges due to the lack of decoration knowledge 
        by the home network. 
         
      
     The Chargeable User Identity (CUI) attribute provides a solution 
     to the above problem and avoids overloading the use of current 
     RADIUS attributes (e.g., UserName(1) re-write).  When the home 
     network assigns a value to the CUI it asserts that this value 
     represents a user in the home network.  The assertion should be 
     temporary.  Long enough to be useful for the external applications 
     and not too long to such that it can be used to identify the user. 
    
     
   1.1 Requirements language 
 
      In this document, several words are used to signify the 
      requirements of the specification.  These words are often 
      capitalized.  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", 
      "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", 
      "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as 
      described in [RFC2119]. 
    
 
   2. Operation 
 
     This document assumes that the RADIUS protocol operates as 
     specified in [1, 2] and that the Diameter protocol operates as 
     specified in[RFC 3588, NASREQ]. 
 
 
 
   2.1 Chargeable User Identity Attribute 
    
      This attribute serves as an alias to the userÆs identity. It is 
      assigned by the home RADIUS server and MAY be sent in Access-
      Accept message.  The NAS or the access network AAA server MUST 
      include  this  attribute  in  the  Accounting  Requests  (Start, 
      Interim, and Stop) messages if it was included in the Access 
      Accept message.  Entities (e.g., NASes, proxies) outside the home 
      network MUST NOT modify the Chargeable User Identity attribute. 
       
      If the RADIUS server includes this attribute in an Access-Accept 
      message it MAY also use this attribute as one of the identity 
      attributes in a Disconnect Message and Change of Authorization 
      message defined by [4].

        String 
 
           The string field is four or more octets. This non-NULL 
           terminated string consists of two colon separated parts. The 
           first part determines the Chargeable-User-Identity type and 
           the  second  part  is  the  actual  Chargeable-User-Identity 
           value. The Chargeable-User-Identity type is coded as two 
           octet string. The Chargeable-User-Identity value must be at 
           least one octet. 
            
           The following User-Identity Alias types have been defined: 
            
           00 û reserved 
           01 û IMSI  
                  The is in international IMSI format according to the 
                  ITU-T E.212 numbering plan as defined in [8] and 
                  [9]). 
           02 û NAI  
                  The identifier is in the form of a Network Access 
                  Identifier as defined in [5]. 
           03 û E.164 number  
                  The  identifier  is  in  international  E.164  format  
                  (e.g. MSISDN, according to the ITU-T E.164  
                  numbering plan as defined in [6] and [7]). 
           04 û SIP URL  
                  The identifier is in the form of a SIP URI as defined 
                  (as defined in [10]).

                  the home network asserts that this value represents a 
                  particular user û itÆs a handle to the user.   
                   
           The length of time for which the Chargeable User Identity is 
           valid is unspecified by this specification and typically 
           would be long enough to serve some business needs and short 
           enough such that it minimizes the chance of revealing the 
           true identity of the user (either directly or indirectly).  
            
           Below are examples of User Identity Alias strings with NAI 
           and E.164 Charging Types: 
            
             ö02:charging-id@realm.orgö 
             ö03:+4689761234ö 
             ö05:charging-idö 
            
           Ideally, the real user identity should not be revealed 
           through this attribute.  However, the operators will have 
           the final word on the used charging type and its identifier.  
            
       
     The following table provides a guide to which attribute(s) may be 
     found in which kinds of packets, and in what quantity.   
    
    
   Request Accept Reject Challenge Accounting  #  Attribute 
                                   Request 
     0      0-1     0       0        0-1       TBD  Chargeable User ID  
    
   [Note 1] If the Access Accept contains Chargeable-User-Identity then 
   the NAS MUST include the Chargeable-User-Identity in Accounting 
   Requests (Start, Interim and Stop) packets. 
    
    
   Change of Authorization and Disconnect-Request 
   Request      ACK      NAK   #    Attribute 
      0-1       0        0     TBD  Chargeable User 
    
   [Note 2] Where Chargeable-User-Identity attribute is included in 
   Disconnect-Request or CoA-Request messages, they are used for 
   identification purposes only.  This attribute MUST NOT be used for 
   purposes other than identification (e.g. within CoA-Request messages 
   to request authorization changes). 
 
   3. Diameter RADIUS Interoperability 
 
      In deployments where both RADIUS clients talking with Diameter 
      Servers or Diameter Client talking with RADIUS server then a 
      translation agent will be deployed and operate in accordance to 
      the NASREQ specification. A counterpart Diameter AVP with a 
      similar content to Chargeable-User-Identity is Diameter Credit-
      Control ApplicationÆs Subscription-ID AVP [11].

   4. IANA Considerations 
 
     This document requires the assignment of a new RADIUS attribute  
     number for the Chargeable User Identity attribute.  
             
                   
 
   5. Security Considerations 
    
     The Chargeable-User-Identity attribute must be protected against 
     Man-in-the-Middle attacks.  The Chargeable-User-Identity appears 
     in Access-Accept and Accounting Requests packets and is protected 
     by the mechanisms that are defined for RADIUS [1] and [2].  
     Therefore there are no additional security considerations beyond 
     those already identified in [1] and [2]. 
      
     Message-Authenticator (80) and Event-Timestamp can be used to 
     further protect against Man-in-the-middle attacks. 
      
     In this document we require that entities outside the home network 
     not modify the value of this attribute yet there are no provisions 
     for protecting against or detecting that a RADIUS Proxy has 
     modified the attribute.
