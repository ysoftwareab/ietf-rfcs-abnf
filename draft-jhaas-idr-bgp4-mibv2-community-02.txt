Internet-Draft             BGP-4 Community MIB             November 2008


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols.  In particular it defines
   objects for managing the Border Gateway Protocol's Community
   extension.  [RFC1997].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   The BGP-4 MIB, Version 2, provides for an extension mechanism by
   which BGP extensions can have MIBs created under the BGP-4 MIB
   subtree.  This MIB documents the objects for managing the BGP-4
   Community extension as documented in [RFC1997].

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

5.1.  Tables

   o  bgp4V2CommunityTable - This table provides access to a human-
      readable version of the community associated with BGP reachability
      and also access to the encoded version of the communities attached
      to the reachability.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

6.1.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The following MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI [RFC2578],
   SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580] and the BGP-4 MIB, Version
   2.

             operator readability.

             Note that SnmpAdminString is only capable of representing a
             maximum of 255 characters.  This may lead to the string
             being truncated in the presence of a large AS Path.  It is
             RECOMMENDED that when this object's contents will be
             truncated that the final 3 octets be reserved for the

            "This object contains the list of BGP Communities associated
             with the reachability.  Each community consists of four
             octets and is interpreted according to the syntax
             documented in RFC 1997.  Briefly, the first two octets of
             each community is a 2-octet Autonomous System number in
             network byte order and the lower two octets is a 2-octet
             number with semantics specific to that AS.

             Note also that certain well-known values will have
             additional semantics.

             In the circumstance where this object must be truncated by
             the implementation, the implementation SHOULD truncate the
             object on a 4-octet divisible boundary in order to provide
             all communities in-tact."

8.  Security Considerations

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  bgp4V2CommunityString, bgp4V2Communities - BGP Communities may be
      used to implement routing policy for ISPs and that routing policy
      may reflect business relationships.  Inadvertent disclosure of
      this information inadvertently expose sensitive information about
      those business relationships.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is

   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.
