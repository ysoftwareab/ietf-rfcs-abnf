Abstract


   The Kerberos cryptosystem specification requires a profile detailing
   several operations for a new checksum type for ensuring the integrity
   of data in Kerberos and related protocol exchanges.  This document
   specifies the use of a simple unkeyed checksum type based on SHA-1.

1. Introduction


   The Kerberos cryptosystem specification requires a profile detailing
   several operations for a new checksum type for ensuring the integrity
   of data in Kerberos and related protocol exchanges.  This document
   specifies the use of a simple unkeyed checksum type based on SHA-1.


   (...to be expanded on a bit, describe PKINIT use...)


2. Checksum Definition


   The SHA-1 Kerberos checksum type calculates a checksum using the
   SHA-1 hash algorithm.  This algorithm takes as input a message of
   arbitrary length, and produces as output a 160-bit (20 octet) hash
   value.


   Any general specification of a Kerberos checksum value to be computed
   must include the encryption key and a key usage value [KCRYPTO].
   Both of these values are ignored for the SHA-1 checksum type, thus
   this checksum algorithm may be used with any encryption key type.


   The parameters for the Kerberos checksum profile for this type are
   thus:



                                   sha1
               ----------------------------------------------
               associated cryptosystem   any


               get_mic                   sha1(msg)


               verify_mic                get_mic and compare



   The sha1 checksum algorithm is assigned a checksum type number of 14.


3. Security Considerations


   Unkeyed checksum types should be used with caution, in limited
   circumstances where the lack of a key does not provide an avenue for
   an attacker to compromise the integrity of the data being conveyed.
   Even when encrypted, the use of unkeyed checksums may allow some
   forms of attack; this is discussed in the Security Considerations
   section of [KCRYPTO].


   The use of unkeyed checksums for integrity protection should be done
   with great care.

4. IANA Considerations


   The Kerberos checksum type values 10 and 14 have both been reserved
   for "sha1 (unkeyed)" per [KCRYPTO], the latter with intent to use it
   with this specification, and the former on the basis of speculation
   that some implementation might have used that value for the same
   purpose.


   XXX...mention PKINIT above as the intended use?


   IANA is directed to assign the Kerberos checksum type value 14 to
   "sha1" with a reference to this document.


   As no supporting information has been found regarding any existing
   experimental use of or specification for Kerberos checksum type 10,
   IANA is directed to delete that registry entry, leaving the value
   available for future assignment.
