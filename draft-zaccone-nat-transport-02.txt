Abstract

   This document describes some mechanisms to enable an IP network to
   transport both the IP traffic of the local realm and the IP traffics
   of external realms in the native (non-tunneled) way [TRANSP-FRAM].

   The methods, described in this document, provide to the routers of
   the operated network the necessary information enabling the delivery
   of IP traffics originated from the foreign realms the operator offer
   connectivity to. This information is derived by the currently
   available routing information routers have and is moreover provided
   to them by the mean of a local delivery mechanism.

1. Introduction

   In an environment where an IP network operator offer connectivity to
   other IP realms that the local one, different schemes enabling this
   objective are possible. Those schemes, described in [TRANSP-FRAM],
   differ from the type of access provided to the customer: physical or
   logical links towards foreign realms. In the former one, the operator
   provide to the customer a physical connection for the required
   foreign realms whereas in the latter one the operator emulate those
   links across its network by the use of a transport technology. The
   different transport technologies, also described in [TRANSP-FRAM],
   are the tunneled and non tunneled approaches.

   Currently, the transport of datagrams, pertaining to other realms
   that the local one, is realised by the use of a tunneling technology.
   However, tunneling technology is not without any inconveniences.

   In this document, we will describe and discus several possible
   mechanisms enabling the operator to deploy the non tunneled approach.
   In extenso, those mechanisms will enable the operator's routers to
   obtain the necessary routing information to delivers datagram issued
   from foreign realms to hosts logically connected to those realms.

2. Terminology

   In the context of this document, the authors assume readers are
   familiar with the terminology as described in [TRANSP-FRAM].

3. OSPF Minimized router deamon (OMRD)

   Most of the time, the Open Short Path First ([OSPF],[OSPF_V6])
   protocol is the one running in autonomous domain. In OSPF, a router
   in the domain constantly informs its neighbour router(s) of its
   current 'UP' ("OK! I  work") status by means of keep alive message
   called 'Hello message'.  Another feature of the protocol is that it

Internet Draft     draft-zaccone-nat-transport-02.txt      March 3, 2000


   allows for autoconfiguration of peer routers in the domain (a router
   could dynamically, but with authentication, become part of the
   routing domain and advertise to its neighbour the status of its
   links).

   This autoconfiguration capability can be deployed to indicate the
   position of the host with a foreign IP address.

   In the OMRD mechanism, each host is a kind of 'sleeping router'. The
   term 'sleeping router' denotes that as soon as the host wishes to
   have outbound access towards a foreign realm, it will participate to
   the domain's routing. The objective of that participation is to
   realise the update of the internal routing in order that datagrams
   having the foreign IP address of that host as destination address are
   routed to a router which has direct connectivity with the host. The
   special case here being that this router is the host itself. Using
   the previously mentioned dynamicity of OSPF, it is possible to
   advertise in the network the host as a new router.

   The minimized aspect of the router is due to the fact that only a
   restricted number of OSPF routing functionality are present.  Indeed,
   it do not have to botter about link advertisement issued from other
   routers. Therefore, it do not have to manage the OSPF links database
   and associated route calculation. Finally, it does not participate in
   the 'designated router' election on the LAN segment.  In short, this
   router has only to advertise itself to the neighbour, advertise
   reachability to a single IP address and flush this information as
   soon as it is obsolete.

   The advantage of this mechanism is that the core routers do not need
   to be modified. As described before, the OSPF flooding procedure
   started by the host routing daemon has as objective to inform the
   entire network of the reachability to the (newly assigned) IP
   address. However, the propagation of the information and the
   recomputing of the OSPF algorithm takes time and could let a host
   which is configured for Internet connectivity to be considered by a
   router as unreachable just because this one is not synchronized yet.
   This converging time puts temporary the network in an incomplete
   state where the way to a destination is not known at the moment. Note
   that the synchronization time of the network is function of its size,
   which therefore may impact the deployement of such mechanism.

4. Using a multicast protocol.

   In a multicast domain, when a host subscribes to a certain multicast
   group, a multicast tree for that multicast group is first created
   (for the first subscriber) and then extented (for new subscribers).
   The multicast tree describes the path the datagrams have to follow

                          Multicast tree example

   In multicast capable domains, the configuration of the tree is
   subject to the specifics of the multicast protocol. When that
   multicast protocol would be able to setup trees for a unicast IP
   addres, it could be used to set up a reverse path to the host with
   the foreign IP address.  The setup of a reverse path could be seen as
   the creation of a native multicast tree by the first subscriber.

   The mechanism to create reverse paths will be the following.
   Assuming that the host has determined that it needs foreign
   connectivity, and that it gets the configuration information (the IP
   stack configuration parameter), it will send a join message to the
   local multicast capable router. The router runs a multicast protocol
   (e.g., PIM) and so allows to set up a reverse path to other multicast
   capable routers, including the border routers.

   When the host determines to release its foreign IP address, a leave
   message for the corresponding IP address will be send in order to
   remove the unicast tree and therefore the reverse path which
   transports the traffic (to that foreign IP address) in the direction
   of that host.

                           Unicast tree example

   The advantage of that mechanism is that it inherits the tree setup
   and maintenance of multicast protocols. However, it requires that
   both the host and the network are multicast capable and that the
   multicast protocol supports the use of non class D IP addresses.

5. Using RSVP

   Another way to allow the set up of a reverse path is the use of (an
   extended) RSVP. That is to say, RSVP will be used to update only
   routers on the path (generally the shortest one) between a host which
   gets a foreign IP address and router(s) connected to the foreign
   realm which owns that foreign IP address.

   In order to create the reverse path, every time a host is configured
   with a foreign IP address, the RSVP protocol will be used between the
   host and edge routers which are connected to the foreign realm that
   supplied the IP address. For those communications, hosts will use the

Internet Draft     draft-zaccone-nat-transport-02.txt      March 3, 2000


   local IP addresses they are assigned.

   To be able to contact edge routers, hosts need to obtain their IP
   addresses. To that aim, hosts may either obtain (e.g. at IP stack
   configuration time) a list of edge routes unicast IP addresses or
   either a list of foreign realm multicast IP addresse (if we consider
   that the network is multicast capable, one may associate a multicast
   group address with each different foreign realms. The edge routers
   subscribe to the foreign realm group address to which they are
   connected, so that they may be also reachable via the foreign realm
   multicast group address they have a subscription to)

   The list of edge routers unicast IP addresses will be used to contact
   those edge routers one by one whereas the foreign realm multicast IP
   address will be used to contact all those edge routers by a single
   message addressed to the group address associated with the foreign
   realm from which the allocated IP address is issued.

   In order to setup reverse path(s), a host will send a RSVP PATH
   message with a to be defined new object. That new object will contain
   the foreign IP address the host has been assigned. As the network is
   already able to route the edge routers unicast (local) IP addresses
   (or the foreign realm multicast IP address), the RSVP message will
   reach those routers using the current paths between them and the
   host. Each time the RSVP message will cross a router (hop by hop), it
   will be interpreted by the router and the required routing table
   entry (IP address -> Forwarding Interface) will be added to the
   current routing database.

   This routing information will depend on the direction on wich the
   RSVP message is interpreted. In the direction of the edge routers,
   the routing information to add is to forward datagrams with the IP
   address contained in the object towards the interface where the RSVP
   PATH message arrived. Whereas in the direction of the host, the
   routing information to add is to forward datagrams with the IP
   address contained in the object towards the interface where the RSVP
   RESERVE message has to be forwarded to.  The choice of one or the
   other is open. When RSVP is used for QoS, actions (resources
   reservation) related to RSVP messages are applied according to the
   second choice with the RESERVE message. This choice is inherent to
   QoS (for outgoing traffic) resource reservation. Here, updating the
   routing table does not have the same impact as reserving resources
   without using them.

   The next figure shows an example of the mechanism. As soon as the
   host has been configured for connectivity to foreign realm Realm2
   (let us say with those information: IP_Y_Realm2 as IP address and R3
   as edge routers unicast list), it will send a PATH message towards

Internet Draft     draft-zaccone-nat-transport-02.txt      March 3, 2000


   router R3 which is connected to the Realm2.

   Let us consider the case where RSVP messages are interpreted when
   going towards router R3. When the PATH message arrives at R1, it
   analyses the associated object, discovers the public IP address and
   creates the entry (IP_Y_Realm2 -> Interface I.1) in its routing
   database. The PATH message will flow hop by hop until it reachs
   router R3, with the same use of the object. When the entire path is
   realised, a reverse path is established.

        RSVP 'setup reverse path' Message         ---/

                 Use of RSVP to establish the reverse path

   The RSVP protocol uses 'soft states'. So, in order to maintain the
   path for the time of the Internet session, the host will continue, at
   regular time interval, to send RSVP 'path keep alive' messages.

   As soon as the foreign connectivity is no longer required (the
   foreign IP address is released) the host will send and RSVP 'path
   tear down' in order to remove the reverse path.

   NB: In the case where the operated network has multiple connections
   to Realm2, the host could setup a reverse path for each of the
   routers connected to this realm. Those multiple reverse paths may be
   useful when more robustness is required. Indeed, as there is
   redundancy in the way to reach the host (from Realm2's network), if
   the edge router on the current shortest path (from Realm2's network
   towards the host) fails, Realm2's network is still able to forward
   traffic to the host using an alternative path.

   The principal advantage of this mechanism compared to OMRD is that
   only a minimum set of routers have to be informed about the location
   of the host, enabling fast establishment of the reverse path.
   Moreover, the mechanism inherits from RSVP the maintenance of the
   path.

   The drawbacks of this mechanism is that the network must be RSVP
   enabled and that both RSVP client and RSVP capable routers must be
   able to manage the new Object.

6. Conclusions

   Delivering traffic, issued from a foreign realm, to host on the
   operated network may be realised like any other traffic as soon as
   routers have the required routing information available.

   Some mechanisms described here may be deployed independently of other
   technologies. Whereas some take as consideration the deployment of
   other technologies, such as multicast and RSVP, to argue for
   scalability and fast deployment by the inheritance of their
   characteristics.

   By using a native transport scheme, a transport technology is not
   required anymore to split the route, between a foreign host and a
   host on the local realm, in two and therefore braking the end-to-end
   principle of the Internet connectivity.
