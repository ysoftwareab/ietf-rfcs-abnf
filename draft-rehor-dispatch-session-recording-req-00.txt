Abstract

   Session recording is a critical requirement in many business
   communications environments such as call centers and financial
   trading floors.  In some of these environments, all calls must be
   recorded for regulatory and compliance reasons.  In others, calls may
   be recorded for quality control or business analytics.  Recording is
   typically done by sending a copy of the media to the recording
   devices.  This document specifies requirements for a protocol that
   will manage delivery of media from an end-point that originates media
   or that has access to it to a recording device.  This protocol is
   being referred to as Session Recording Protocol and will most likely
   be based on SIP.

1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] and indicate
   requirement levels for compliant mechanisms.


2.  Introduction

   Session recording is a critical operational requirement in many
   businesses, especially where voice is used as a medium for commerce
   and customer support.  A prime example where voice is used for trade
   is the financial industry.  The call recording requirements in this
   industry are quite stringent.  The recorded calls are used for
   dispute resolution and compliance.  Other businesses such as customer
   support call centers typically employ call recording for quality
   control or business analytics, with different requirements.

   Depending on the country and its regulatory requirements, financial
   trading floors typically must record all calls.  The recorded media
   content must be an exact copy of the actual conversation (i.e.
   clipping and loss of media are unacceptable).  A new call attempt
   would be automatically rejected if the recording device becomes
   temporarily unavailable.  An existing call would be dropped in the
   same situation.  In contrast, support call centers typically only
   record a subset of the calls, and calls must not fail regardless of
   the availability of the recording device.

   Furthermore, the scale and cost burdens vary widely, in all markets,
   where the different needs for solution capabilities such as media
   injection, transcoding, and security-related needs do not conform
   well to a one-size-fits-all model.  If a standardized solution
   supports all of the requirements from every recording market, but
   doing so would be expensive for markets with lesser needs, then
   proprietary solutions for those markets will continue to propagate.
   Care must be taken, therefore, to make a standards-based solution
   support optionality and flexibility.

   It should be noted that the requirements for the protocol between a
   Recording Server and Recording Client have very similar requirements
   (such as codec and transport negotiation, encryption key interchange,
   firewall traversal) as compared to regular SIP media sessions.  The
   choice of SIP for session recording provides reuse of an existing
   protocol.  This document specifies requirements for a protocol
   between a Recording Client and a Recording Server, which is most
   likely going to be SIP[RFC3261] itself.  The Recording Client is the
   source of the recorded media.  The Recording Server is the sink of

   recorded media.

   The recorded sessions can be of any kind such as voice, video and
   instant messaging.  An archived session recording is typically
   comprised of the session media content and the session metadata.  The
   session metadata allows recording archives to be searched and
   filtered at a later time.  The conveyance of session metadata from
   the Recording Client to the Recording Server may or may not be over
   SIP.  The requirements for session metadata delivery will be
   specified in a future revision of this document or in a separate
   document.

   This document only looks into active recording, where the Recording
   Client purposefully streams media to a Recording Server.  Passive
   recording, where a recording device detects media directly from the
   network, is outside the scope of this document.  In addition, lawful
   intercept is outside the scope of this document.

   Another, related IETF draft is draft-wing-sipping-srtp-key
   [I-D.wing-sipping-srtp-key], which describes an approach for
   providing SRTP session keys to a recorder-type server.  That draft
   focuses on the mechanism to provide the SRTP session key, rather than
   the mechanism to invoke and sustain recording sessions themselves.

   There are already IETF Working Groups focusing on related or similar
   concepts: Mediactrl and Xcon.  The work to address the requirements
   outlined in this draft may end up being done in those Working Groups,
   or a new one may be formed.


3.  Definitions

   Recording Server (RS): A Recording Server (RS) is a specialized media
   server or collector that acts as the sink of the recorded media.  An
   RS typically archives media for extended durations of time and
   provides interfaces for search and retrieval of the archived media.
   An RS is typically implemented as a multi-port device that is capable
   of receiving media from several sources simultaneously.  An RS is
   typically also the sink of the recorded session metadata.  Note that
   the term "Server" does not imply the RS is the server side of a
   signaling protocol - the RS may be the initiator of recording
   requests, for example.

   Recording Client (RC): A Recording Client (RC) is a SIP User Agent
   (UA) or a Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA) that acts as the source of
   the recorded media, sending it to the RS.  An RC is a logical
   function.  Its capabilities may be implemented across one or more
   physical devices.  In practice, an RC could be a personal device



Rehor, et al.            Expires April 29, 2010                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft            Requirements for SRP              October 2009


   (such as a SIP phone), a SIP Media Gateway (MG), a Session Border
   Controller (SBC) or a SIP Media Server (MS) integrated with an
   Application Server (AS).  This specification defines the term RC such
   that all such SIP entities can be generically addressed under one
   definition.  The RC itself or another entity working on its behalf
   (such as a SIP Application Server) may act as the source of the
   recording metadata.

   Session Recording Protocol (SRP): The Session Recording Protocol
   (SRP) is a to-be-defined protocol that will be used to establish
   media sessions between an RC and RS, for the purpose of delivering
   media from the RC to the RS.  It may, for example, be SIP.

   Recording Session: The session created between an RC and RS for the
   purpose of recording a Recorded Session.  The Recorded Session may
   itself be based on SIP, but it is a separate session from the
   Recording Session.

   Recorded Session: A session created between a UAC and UAS that is
   recorded by the RC and RS systems.

   Dynamic Recording: Dynamic recording is a mode of recording where the
   recording sessions are established on an as needed basis.  The length
   of these sessions is typically same as the length of the actual media
   sessions.

   Persistent Recording: Persistent recording is a mode of recording
   where the recording sessions are established at system start-up and
   kept-alive from that point on.  The length of these sessions is
   independent from the length of the actual recorded media sessions.
   Persistent recording sessions avoid issues such as media clipping
   that can occur due to delays in recording session establishment.

   Business Analytics: Business analytics refers to analyzing recorded
   media and the related metadata for various kinds of business goals
   such as decision making, statistical and quantitative analysis.


4.  Use Cases

   Use Case 1: Full-time Recording

   Record all calls:

   o Regulatory compliance or business process purposes.

   o Enterprise or Contact Center.




Rehor, et al.            Expires April 29, 2010                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft            Requirements for SRP              October 2009


   Use Case 2: Selective recording

   Record only specific calls.  Selection of a call to be recorded may
   be made automatically based on business rules, or manually via a
   user-controlled mechanism (e.g. button on user&rsquos phone):

   o Enterprise back office recording where only specific calls (based
   on privacy) have to be recorded

   o A user requests session recording at call setup time or during a
   call.

   Use Case 3: Persistent recording

   Record continuously without interruption.  Applications include
   financial trading desks and emergency (first-responder) service
   bureaus.

   Use Case 4: Real-time Recording Controls

   For an active Recording Session, privacy or security reasons may
   demand not capturing a specific portion of a conversation.  An
   example is for PCI (payment card industry) compliance where credit
   card info must be protected.  One solution is to not record a caller
   speaking their credit card information.

   Real-time controls may include Pause/Resume, or Mute/Unmute.

   Use Case 5: IVR / Voice Portal Recording

   Self-service Interactive Voice Response (DTMF or ASR) applications
   may need to be recorded for application performance tuning or to meet
   compliance requirements.

   Use Case 6: Enterprise Mobility Recording

   Many agents and agents and enterprise workers are not located on
   company premises.

   Examples:

   o Home-based agents or enterprise workers.

   o Mobile phones of knowledge workers when they conduct work related
   (and legally required recording) calls. i.e. insurance agents,
   brokers, physicians.

   Use Case 7: Geographically distributed or centralized recording



Rehor, et al.            Expires April 29, 2010                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft            Requirements for SRP              October 2009


   Global banks with multiple branches &mdash up to thousands of small
   sites

   o Only phones and network infrastructure in branches, no recording
   services.

   o Internal calls inside or between branches must be recorded.

   o Centralized recording system in data centers together with
   telephony infrastructure (e.g.  PBX).

   Obtain media by forking:

   o In data centers (inbound/outbound): fork media in gateway.

   o At branch locations (internal): fork from end points or from site
   level gateways.

   o Conference based solution is not applicable because it will require
   to reroute all communications via data centers.

   Use Case 8: Record complex calls

   Record a call that is associated with another call.

   Example:

   o Customer in conversation with Agent

   o Agent puts customer on hold in order to consult with a supervisor.

   o Agent in conversation with Supervisor.

   o Agent disconnects from Supervisor, reconnects with Customer.

   o Each conversation is stored as a separate recording.  The
   Supervisor call must be associated with the original customer call.

   Use case 9: High-Availability, High Reliability Recording

   If recorder is not available at call setup time:

   o Reject request to establish recorded session.

   o Redirect to alternate recorder

   If recorder has failed during a call, take specific action:

Internet-Draft            Requirements for SRP              October 2009


   o Fail/Transfer call / fail over to a different recorder (may involve
   loss of recording during transition time).

   o Failover recovery situation: continuation of a call recorded on a
   different recorder.  Protocol must indicate that a Recording Session
   is a continuation of a previous Recording Session.

   For some use cases, if recording is not available or failed in a
   middle of the call, original conversation has to be terminated or
   alerted as well.

   Use Case 10: Record multi-channel, multi-media session

   Some applications require the recording of more than one media
   stream, possibly of different types.  Media is synchronized, either
   at storage or at playback.

   Speech analytics technologies (e.g. word spotting, emotion detection,
   speaker identification) may require speaker-separated recordings for
   optimum performance.

   Multi-modal Contact Centers may include audio, video, IM or other
   interaction modalities.

   Use Case 11: Real-time media processing

   Recorder must support real-time media processing, such as speech
   analytics.

   Recording and real-time analytics of trading floor interactions
   (including video and instant messaging).  Real time analytics is
   required for automatic intervention (stopping interaction or alert)
   if for example, trader is not following regulations.

   Speaker separation is required in order to reliably detect who is
   saying specific phrases.


5.  Example Deployment Architectures

   Although this document discusses requirements and not solutions,
   there are certain assumptions made regarding the solution space.  One
   goal is to support existing, deployed architectures for Session
   Recording.  Session Recording is an established practice, albeit with
   proprietary protocols; it is the protocols between systems that this
   document aims at addressing requirements towards, in order to
   eventually produce an IETF defined protocol, or a set of protocols,
   for performing Session Recording in a non-proprietary fashion.

   The current Session Recording market typically performs recording in
   one of the two ways.  In some cases, a middle-box acts as a RC and
   sends media to the recorder (RS).  A simple diagram of this is shown
   below:

   In some deployments the RS notifies the RC when to record a session,
   which requires the RS to have some means of identifying that a
   session is taking place and how to reference the particular session
   to record.  In other cases, the RC notifies the RS when it wants to
   record a session.  In both cases, there is often a separate
   connection, or even separate protocol, for communicating metadata
   about a session, distinct from the protocol connection used for
   communicating the recording information.

6.  Requirements

   The following are requirements for the Session Recording Protocol:

   o REQ-001 The mechanism MUST support full-time Recording Sessions.

   o REQ-002 The mechanism MUST support dynamic (on-demand) Recording
   Sessions.

   o REQ-003 The mechanism MUST support persistent Recording Sessions,
   such that the connection and attributes of media in the Recording
   Session are not dynamically signaled for each Recorded Session before
   it can be recorded.  Call details and metadata will still be
   signaled, but can be post- correlated to the recorded media.  There
   will still need to be a means of correlating the recorded media
   connection/packets to the Recorded Session, however this may be on a
   permanent filter-type basis, such as based on a SIP AoR of an agent
   that is always recorded, or based on identifiers in the recorded
   media itself.

   o REQ-004 The mechanism MUST support establishing Recording Sessions



Rehor, et al.            Expires April 29, 2010                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft            Requirements for SRP              October 2009


   from the RC to the RS.  This requirement typically applies when the
   decision on whether a session should be recorded or not resides in
   the RC.

   o REQ-005 The mechanism MUST support establishing Recording Sessions
   from the RS to the RC.  This requirement typically applies when the
   decision on whether a session should be recorded or not resides in
   the RS.

   o REQ-006 The mechanism MUST support the recording of IVR sessions.

   o REQ-007 The mechanism SHOULD support RS failover and migration of
   Recording Sessions to a working RS without disconnecting the Recorded
   Sessions.

   o REQ-008 The mechanism MUST support a means of providing security
   (confidentiality, integrity and authentication) for the SRP.

   o REQ-009 The mechanism MUST support the ability to deliver mixed
   media streams to the RS.  The RS MAY be informed about the
   composition of the mixed streams through session metadata.

   Note: A mixed media stream is where several recorded sessions are
   carried in a single recording session.  A mixed media stream is
   typically produced by a mixer function.

   o REQ-010 The mechanism MUST support the ability to deliver multiple
   media streams for a given Recorded Session over separate Recording
   Sessions to the RS.

   o REQ-011 The mechanism MUST support the ability to deliver multiple
   media streams for a given Recorded Session over a single Recording
   Session to the RS.

   o REQ-012 The mechanism MUST support the ability to pause and resume
   the Recording Session either from RC or from the RS.

   o REQ-013 The mechanism MUST support the ability to inject tones into
   the Recorded Session either from the RS or from the RC.

   o REQ-014 If SIP [RFC3261] is chosen as the Session Recording
   Protocol, there MUST be a way for the Recording Session to identify
   itself as a SIP session that is established for the purpose of
   recording.  This will provide a way to disambiguate the Recording
   Session from the Recorded Session.

   o REQ-015 The mechanism MUST support the ability to provide
   authentication, eavesdropping protections, and non-repudiation for

   the media sent in the Recording Session, between the RC and RS.

   o REQ-016 The mechanism MUST support the ability to provide
   authorization and authentication of the RS to the RC, and the RC to
   the RS.

   o REQ-017 The mechanism MUST support the ability to provide
   eavesdropping protection and non-repudiation for the SRP.

   o REQ-018 The mechanism MUST support the ability to correlate the SRP
   request to record a call, with the session being recorded.

   o REQ-019 The mechanism MUST support the ability to correlate the SRP
   request to record specific media sessions, with the SIP session and
   media to be recorded.

   o REQ-020 The mechanism MUST support the ability to have a separate
   session/connection for the Session Recording Protocol, from that for
   the Session Metadata transport.

   o REQ-021 The mechanism MUST support the ability for the RC to only
   perform media replication to the RS, without needing to decode or mix
   audio/video/etc., and without needing to be an RTP agent.  This will
   allow the RC to replicate media at layers below RTP.  Clearly, such
   an RC mode would not be able to provide transcoding, or media
   injection from the RS back into the Recorded Session.

   o REQ-021 The mechanism MUST support a means for a SIP UA to request
   that a session is not recorded.

   o REQ-022 The mechanism MUST provide an indication to a SIP UA that a
   session in which it is providing media is being recorded.

   o REQ-023 A Recording Session may start at call setup.

   o REQ-024 A Recording Session may start during a call.

   o REQ-025 The mechanism SHOULD support loss less delivery of media
   content from RC to the RS.  Note that the specific use of recording
   will dictate the integrity of the media.  Trading floors or financial
   offices may prefer complete loss less delivery of media whereas call
   centers, for instance, may tolerate some media loss.

   o REQ-026 The mechanism SHOULD support means to avoid clipping media
   (leading or trailing samples) when the media is transported from the
   RC to the RS.

   Note: Media clipping can occur due to delays in recording session

   establishment.  RC implementations typically buffer some portion of
   the media to overcome this problem.

   o REQ-027 Recording Server must reject recording request if service
   is unavailable (e.g. system overload, disk full, etc.)

   o REQ-028 A request for a new Recording Session must be redirected to
   an available recorder server.

   o REQ-029 If no recording resources are available, appropriate error
   message must be returned.

   o REQ-030 Recorder must provide alarm notifications when a failure
   occurs


7.  Security Considerations

   Session recording has substantial security implications, both for the
   SIP UA's being recorded, and for the Session Recording Protocol
   itself in terms of the RC and RS.

   For the SIP UA's involved in the Recorded Session, the requirements
   in this draft enable the UA to identify that a session is being
   recorded and for the UA to request that a given session is not
   subject to recording.

   Since humans don't typically look at or know about protocol signaling
   such as SIP, and indeed the SIP session might have originated through
   a PSTN Gateway without any ability to pass on in-signaling
   indications of recording, users can be notified of recording in the
   media itself through voice announcements, or a visual indicator on
   the endpoint.

   With regards to security implications of the protocol(s), clearly
   there is a need for authentication, authorization, eavesdropping
   protection, and non-repudiation for the solution.  The RC needs to
   know the RS it is communicating with is legitimate, and vice-versa,
   even if they are in different domains.  Both the signaling and media
   for the SRP needs the ability to be authenticated and protected from
   eavesdropping and non-repudiation.  Requirements for this are
   detailed in the requirements section.
