1.  Introduction

   Video content delivery is now the major bandwidth usage over the
   Internet.  Globally, IP video traffic will be 82 percent of all IP
   traffic (both business and consumer) by 2020, up from 70 percent in
   2015. 4K Ultra HD technology is by itself a very new trend in the
   overall electronics landscape, and the impact of it is growing month
   by month.  More content is accessible, in more formats, on more
   devices, for more people than ever before.  Content providers and
   broadcasters are embracing multi-platform to attract more audiences.
   For example, IPTV providers not just provide video services on fix
   network but also consider to start the services for mobile accessed
   users; Traditional broadcasters not just provide services over cable
   or satellite, but also consider to start the services over IP
   network.  How to transmit video traffic efficiently over these mutli-
   platforms poses challenges to these service providers.

   This document explores the existing video delivery technologies and
   analyses these challenges.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Multi-platform for Video distribution

   The same content could be delivered in different networks including
   broadband, mobile, satellite, cable and terrestrial.  And the
   receiving devices can be all kinds of STBs, mobile phones, tablets
   and PCs.  This is shown in Figure 1.

                 Figure 2: Video Delivery Protocol Stacks

   Today, there exist many diverged video delivery protocol stacks, as
   listed in Figure 2.  Looking bottom-up, from the angle of
   transmission methods, the protocol stacks can be categorized into two
   modes: "Pull Mode" and "Push Mode".  In "Pull Mode", client takes the
   initiative and pulls content from server proactively.  Typical "Pull
   Mode" methods include HTTP progressive download and HTTP Adaptive

   Stream (e.g.  HLS and DASH).  On the other hand, "Push Mode"
   operations are more server oriented.  After session has been
   established, server controls the delivery by intentionally pushing
   content to client.  Typical "Pull Mode" transmissions include IPTV
   and other multicast based methods.

   Another way to look at the protocol stacks is from the top-down
   angle, regarding how media are prepared before transmission.
   Traditional media delivery utilizes "Packet Mode", in which media is
   packetized with regard to their internal structure, so the resulting
   packets are optimized for transport and more loss tolerant.  An
   example is transporting H.264 encoded video directly over RTP.
   Unlike "Packet Mode", segmented media grows more popular as they are
   adopted by HTTP Adaptive Streaming.  Segmented media are referred to
   as "File Mode" in Figure 2, for the fact that media segments are seen
   as plain files, and described by additional manifests.

   The divergence in the protocol stacks has brought several issues, as
   the bottom-up angle and the top-down angel do not align with each
   other ("File Mode" and "Push Mode" are overlapping):

   o  "File Mode" is not quite suitable to be used in "Push Mode", as
      the transports lack timing information.

   o  "File Mode" is very difficult to be converted into "Packet Mode",
      and thus cannot be transported using unreliable protocols such as
      RTP.

   The divergence increases the overall complexity of video delivery.
   The next section analyzes the impact introduced by the complexity.

5.  Impact of Diversity on IP distribution

   Currently the IP Headend (as in Figure 1) is unduly complicated by
   the diversity on IP distribution, as illustrated below:

                       +----+----+ =========================>
                            |
               +------------+-------------+

          o MPEG-2      o M2TS        o Access Control
          o H.264       o DASH        o Digital Right Management
          o H.265       o HLS         o Encryption

                     Figure 3: Complicated IP Headend

   It is a tedious job for the IP Headend to encode the same content
   into different variants using different media profiles, prepare them
   in several types of packaging, and apply different protection
   mechanisms before the variants are served.  The consequence is
   increased cost in design, deployment, test and operation.

   The situation is further complicated by the diversity of network
   delivery mechanisms and content forms.  Unicast delivery supports
   "Pull Mode" and "Push Mode", whereas multicast delivery only supports
   "Push Mode".  Each delivery mechanism uses different transport
   protocols and support different content forms.  "Pull Mode" supports
   "File Mode" content, and "Push Mode" supports content in both "File
   Mode" and "Push Mode".

   "File Mode" content is usually served in "Pull mode".  However, it
   can also be served in "Push Mode" by using reliable multicast
   technologies (e.g.  FLUTE, NORM).  Serving "File Mode" content with
   "Push Mode" delivery would increase delay, as the reliability
   mechanisms imply using retransmission to recover lost data.  It has
   impact on applications that require low-delay transport, for example,
   live video or virtual reality.

   If an application can tolerate a level of packet loss, then it is
   possible for the application to transform content from "File Mode"
   into "Packet mode", and transfer more efficiently in "Push Mode".  An
   example would be to transform HLS media segments of MPEG-2 TS format
   into RTP packets, and multicast those RTP packets carrying MPEG-2 TS
   content to endpoints.  However, this is only possible if the
   application is authorized to access the content and do the
   transformation.  It is usually not the case in real-life scenarios.
   In order to protect contents, such transformation is not allowed in
   delivery by content providers.

   There have been efforts to provide convergence for this diversified
   situation.  New media packaging formats such as MMT, CMAF are
   proposed by MPEG that can packetize the media in application layer.
   So the same packaged media content can support both "File Mode" and
   "Packet Mode".  To support the new packaging formats, maybe a content
   agnostic transport protocol should be developed here in IETF.
