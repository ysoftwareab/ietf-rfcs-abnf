1. Introduction                               

   One pseudo-wire may reach across more than one packet switched 
   network (PSN) domain and more than one PSN tunnel. These pseudo-wires 
   are called multi-segment pseudo-wires (MS-PW). One pseudo-wire may 
   exist in only one packet switched network (PSN) domain and only one 
   PSN tunnel. These pseudo-wires are called single-segment pseudo-wires 
   (SS-PW). 

   The interworking of operation and maintenance (OAM) mechanisms for 
   SS-PWs between ACs and PWs is defined in [OAMMAP], which enables 
   defect states to be propagated across a PWE3 network. OAM mechanisms 
   for MS-PWs MUST provide at least the same capabilities   as those for

   SS-PWs, i.e., which must comply with SS-PW OAM mechanisms. In 
   addition, it should be possible to support the other OAM requirements 
   described in [MSPWREQ]. 

   This draft extends the VCCV mechanism described in [VCCV] to 
   implement MS-PW OAM functions. To support FDI function, new FDI 
   payload packet type is introduced.

   One MS-PW may consist of multiple SS-PWs and can be regarded as one 
   logical pseudo wire. Each of the single SS-PW can be regarded as one 
   individual physical link. From layer network point of view, MS-PW is 
   a client sublayer and SS-PW is the server sublayer. Thus, the 
   reference model above can be illustrated by the following figure.

   End-to-end OAM (E2E OAM) flow is used for the OAM communications 
   between the ingress PE and the egress PE of a logic MS-PW. Segment 
   OAM (SEG OAM) flow is used for the OAM communications between the 
   ingress PE and the egress PE of a physical per-segment SS-PW. Refer 
   to the above reference model, we can deduce the following MS-PW OAM 
   reference model.

3. MS-PW OAM functions 

3.1. Segment OAM and End-to-end OAM 

   End-to-end OAM (E2E OAM) packets are generated at U-PE of a MS-PW, 
   transferred transparently across all S-PEs, and terminated at the 
   remote end U-PE of the MS-PW. Segment OAM (SEG OAM) packets are 
   generated at U-PE of a SS-PW, terminated at the remote end U-PE of 
   the SS-PW, where U-PE can be U-PE of the SS-PW, or S-PE of the MS-PW.  

   SEG OAM mechanism is as same as the existing OAM mechanism defined in 
   [VCCV], [OAMMAP], [CTRL]. 

   For each SS-PW, SEG OAM mechanisms could be adopted. For each MS-PW, 
   E2E OAM mechanisms could be used as described in following.  

   For example, when we use one MS-PW to protect another MS-PW, we can 
   use the E2E OAM mechanisms. If only one segment of the MS-PW, for 
   some reasons such as management/resource/environment conditions, need 
   be protected, SEG OAM must only be used at some specific PW segment. 
 
 
Dong                   Expires April 10, 2006                 [Page 4] 

Internet-Draft     draft-dong-pwe3-mspw-oam-00.txt        October 2005 
    

   Of course, we maybe perform E2E OAM and SEG OAM mechanisms over a MS-
   PW and its segment PWs at the same time. 

   When S-PE receives one OAM packet, it must determine whether it is a 
   SEG OAM packet or an E2E OAM packet. The existing OAM mechanism can't 
   perform this, so it must be enhanced. 

   The ingress PE or the egress PE that belongs to one SS-PW shall 
   discard all the segment OAM packets coming from another PW segment. 

3.2. Fault Notification 

   A PE can receive all kinds of faults reported. The PE may receive 
   physical layer fault report, such as loss of signal. The PE itself 
   may also detect segment fault by VCCV mechanism. An S-PE is also a PE. 
   When an S-PE receives fault report from server layer or a segment 
   fault is detected, the S-PE must forward the fault information to the 
   remote end U-PE of the MS-PW. When a U-PE receives such fault 
   information, it can suppress other alarm information or trigger 
   protection switching. This mechanism is called FDI (Forwarding Defect 
   Indication). 

   At the S-PE, defects in a PSN tunnel must be propagated to all PWs 
   that utilize the tunnel. And FDI OAM packets should be sent to all 
   these PWs. 

   The S-PE which detects a fault shall generate and send out FDI 
   packets to all effected active PWs in the forwarding direction. These 
   faults include, without limit to: 

   - transport tunnel faults; 

   - faults coming from PW status notification; 

   - faults detected by local OAM mechanisms, such as BFD; 

   - local PE faults, such as control software faults. 

   The FDI packets shall be generated and sent to the downstream U-PE of 
   the MS-PW from S-PE as soon as possible when any fault is detected. 
   The FDI packets shall be sent periodically until the fault is 
   recovered. The transmission speed should be one packet per second. 
   The egress PE of a MS-PW will maintain the status of FDI for each MS-
   PW. When the egress PE receives a valid FDI packet, the corresponding 
   MS-PW will enter into the FDI state. If the egress PE received E2E 
   OAM packets from the ingress PE, or no FDI packets are received in

   the three consecutive transmission periods (e.g., three seconds), the 
   MS-PW will exit FDI state. 

   When the U-PE of a MS-PW received a FDI packet, it will send PW 
   status TLV to the peer side U-PE of the MS-PW to notify the current 
   MS-PW status. 

   When an S-PE detected a fault, if the S-PE supports segment OAM 
   functions, it will send PW status TLV to the peer side U-PE of the 
   SS-PW to notify the current SS-PW status. 

   To notify fault information to the remote side PE, the following new 
   OAM packet format is proposed. 

      0                   1                   2                   3

         address family is IPv4, the first 12 octets of this field are 
         filled with zero. 

   Lifetime (32 bits):  

         Indicates the transmission period of FDI packets to the 
         receiver. Its unit is millisecond. 

3.3. OAM Extension 

   There are three kinds of OAM data channel [VCCV], which are inband 
   VCCV, out-of-band VCCV, and TTL expiry VCCV. The first one uses the 
   first four nibbles 0001 of the control word to identify OAM packets. 
   The second one uses router alert label to identify the OAM packets. 
   The last one uses TTL= 1 to force the PE process the OAM packets. 

   Because both SEG OAM and E2E OAM have BFD/LSP PING/ICMP PING packet, 
   the type of segment OAM packet must be distinguished, i.e. , SEG OAM 
   packet or E2E OAM packet. When a PE receives an OAM packet, it must 
   determine the packet type (FDI, or others), because FDI checking 
   procedure is different from procedure of other packet types. 

3.3.1. Inband VCCV Extension 

   The following PW Associated Channel Header format is proposed to 
   extend the OAM. 

      0                   1                   2                   3

   (Figure 5) are as follows:  

   FmtID:  refer to [CW]. 

   T:  

         Indicates the segment type of OAM packet. 

         T = 0 indicates it is SEG OAM packet. 

         T = 1 indicates it is E2E OAM packet.

   F:  

         Indicates the FDI type of OAM packet. 

         F = 0 indicates it is not a FDI packet. 

         F = 1 indicates it is a FDI packet. 

   Reserved: MUST be set 0, and ignored in reception.  

   Channel Type: Refer to [CW].  

3.3.2. Out-of-band VCCV Extension 

   The out-of-band OAM is generally used when the control word is not 
   used, or the receiving hardware can't process the control word, in 
   the out-of-band VCCV channel. The VCCV control channel can be created 
   via using the MPLS router alert label [RFC3032]. 

   The indicator flag in the payload header may be added to identify the 
   type of OAM packet as the following format. 

      0                   1                   2                   3

   VCCV.  

3.3.3. Expiry TTL VCCV Extension 

   For expiry TTL VCCV, it is possible that using control word or not 
   using control word. The OAM payload format described in section 3.3.2 
   is proposed.

4. OAM Capability Indication for Multi-segment PW using MPLS 

4.1. Introduction 

   For a MPLS-PSN, the PE negotiates the utilization of the VCCV when 
   the label mapping messages are exchanged to establish the PW. A new 
   OAM TLV is signaled as part of the PW FEC interface parameters TLV 
   [VCCV].If LDP PW ID FEC (FEC 128) is used, the OAM capability TLV is 
   carried in the Interface Parameter's field. If the LDP Generalized PW 
   ID FEC (FEC 129) is used, it is carried as a sub-TLV in the Interface 
   Parameter's TLV.  

   The CV Type Indicator's field in this TLV defines a bit-mask used to     
   indicate the specific OAM capabilities that the PE can make use of     
   over the PW being established.  

   The defined values are:  

          0x01 ICMP Ping (predefined in [VCCV]) 

          0x02 LSP Ping (predefined in [VCCV]) 

          0x04 BFD for PW Fault Detection only (predefined in [VCCV]) 

          0x08 BFD for PW Fault Detection and AC/PW Fault  

               Status Signaling (predefined in [VCCV]) 

          0x10  FDI 

          0x20  SEG OAM 

          0x40  E2E OAM 

   A CV type of 0x08 is part of the MS-PW OAM capabilities. It indicates 
   that the PE supports FDI function. When S-PE detects the fault, it 
   will notify the remote side PE of the fault and the latter enters 
   into the proper PW defect state and triggers the appropriate actions. 

   A CV type of 0x10 is part of the MS-PW OAM capabilities. It indicates     
   that the PE supports segment OAM function. In general, PE will 
   support segment OAM function, this CV type provides an option to open 
   or close the function. It benefits in saving the OAM bandwidth. 

   A CV type of 0x20 is part of the MS-PW OAM capabilities. It indicates     
   that the PE supports end-to-end OAM function. When S-PE receives a 
   E2E OAM packet, it will forward the packet transparently.

   Note that FDI packet must be E2E OAM packet. 

   After the negotiation process of OAM capability, U-PE may adopt SEG 
   OAM, or E2E OAM, or both of them. When U-PE adopted both, it must 
   send the two types of OAM packet at the same time. S-PE only 
   generates the SEG OAM packets and the FDI packets, forwards the E2E 
   OAM packets including the FDI packets, and terminates the received 
   SEG OAM packets. If S-PE doesn't adopt SEG OAM, it should drop the 
   received SEG OAM packet and doesn't generate any SEG OAM packets. If 
   S-PE does not adopt E2E OAM, it should drop the received E2E OAM 
   packet. This case is for further study if S-PE should generate the 
   FDI packets. 

5. MS-PW OAM procedures in IP PSN 

   When L2TPv3 is used to setup a PW over an IP PSN, [VCCV] uses L2-
   Specific sublayer to carry VCCV messages, and describes an L2TPv3 
   VCCV capability AVP which provides the equivalent means to signal OAM 
   capabilities between PEs for PW over a L2TP-IP PSN. 

   To support FDI function of the MS-PW OAM capability, a new type of 
   FDI AVP message is defined. To support the new MS-PW OAM capability 
   indicators, a new CV type in VCCV Capability AVP message is defined. 

5.1. L2TPv3 VCCV FDI AVP Message 

   The VCCV message MUST contain a VCCV AVP. It does not contain a 
   message header. This could either be a new VCCV ICMP Ping AVP or VCCV 
   BFD AVP or VCCV FDI AVP. The former two are described in [CTRL]. 

   The VCCV FDI AVP encodes the FDI Packet. This AVP may be followed by 
   the L2TPv3 Remote End Identifier AVP to identify the PW associated 
   with the session. 

5.2. L2TPv3 VCCV Capability Indication AVP Message 

   A LCCE or a LAC should be able to indicate whether the session is   
   capable of processing VCCV packets by including the optional VCCV 
   capability AVP in an ICRQ, ICRP, OCRQ or OCRP.  

   The CV Type Indicators field in this AVP message defines a bitmask 
   used to indicate the specific type or types (i.e.: none, one or more) 
   of IP control packets that may be sent on the specified control 
   channel. The defined values are: 

          0x01 ICMP Ping (predefined in [VCCV])

          0x02 BFD (predefined in [VCCV]) 

          0x04 FDI 

          0x08  SEG OAM 

          0x10  E2E OAM 

   The meaning of the CV type is as same as described in section 4.1. 

   The OAM procedure after negotiation of OAM capability is as same as 
   described in section 4.1.
