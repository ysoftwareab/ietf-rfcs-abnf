Abstract

   A generic YANG data model for Operations, Administration, and
   Maintenance (OAM) has been defined in [GENYANGOAM], with the
   intention that technology-specific extensions will be developed to
   complete the implementation of the model.  In this document, we
   describe the applicability of the generic YANG OAM data model to
   specific OAM technologies.  To be concrete, we also demonstrate the
   usability and extensibility of the generic YANG OAM model with OAM
   protocols such as IP Ping, traceroute, and LSP Ping.

1.  Introduction

   The YANG [RFC6020] over NETCONF [RFC6241] data model for Layer
   independent OAM Management defined in [GENYANGOAM] provides
   consistent configuration, reporting and representation of OAM
   mechanisms at any layer for any technology.

   This draft describes the applicability of the generic YANG OAM model
   to various transport technologies and demonstrates that the YANG
   model(s) in the LIME WG are usable and extensible for those
   technologies.  The demonstration uses IP, Ethernet, NVO3, TRILL, and
   MPLS as specific examples.

            Figure 1: Structure of the Generic LIME Base Model

   The generic YANG OAM model comprises three definitions for
   configuration and operational state data:

   o  configuration model definition;

   o  Remote procedure call (RPC) definition;

   o  and notification definition.

   The configuration model definition provides hierarchical structure to
   describe fault domain (i.e., maintainence domain), test point (i.e.,
   maintainence point), technology type, layering, and session context
   for trouble-shooting.  This basic configuration model enables users
   to select corresponding layers and nodes serving as anchor points to
   define their specific technology OAM YANG models.

   The RPC definition provides uniform APIs for common OAM functions
   such as continuity check, connectivity verification, path discovery,
   performance measurement and their equivalents.  These APIs are used
   by the network management system (NMS) to control and manipulate OAM
   tools and functionalities on network elements for measuring and
   monitoring the data plane (e.g., LSP Ping, IP performance measurement
   protocol).  These OAM tools can be activated on a continual basis or
   manually to detect a specific anomaly.

   The notification definition also provides a uniform API to report
   defects, faults, and network failures at different layers.  This API
   is used by network elements to report to the network management
   system (NMS).  The content of each notification includes the fault
   domain and the test point(s) that detected the fault and generated
   the error message.  This API must be activated on a continual basis.

4.  Guidelines For Extending the LIME Base Data Model

   As described in Section 3, the LIME base model provides a
   hierarchical structure for configuration, notification and RPCs.
   Each of these three aspects should be extended with technology-
   specific features and parameters relating to each technology of
   interest.

   YANG allows a module to insert additional nodes into data models,
   including both the current module (and its submodules) or an external
   module.  This is useful to let specific technologies add specific
   parameters into the LIME base model.

   Here we summarize five steps to extend the LIME base model for
   specific technologies:

   1.  Import the base model in the technology specific OAM model to
       reuse the structure defined in the base model.

   2.  Use "augment" to insert additional data into the base model
       (e.g., in the MEP) to specify extensions for the specific
       technology.

   3.  Use the "identity" and "identityref" constructs (instead of
       "enum") to identify new technology types.

   4.  Use "choice" and "case" nodes instead of "typedef".

   5.  Use "feature" to define optional functionality within the data
       model.

Internet-Draft      Applicability of LIME Base Model           June 2015


   6.  Define new RPCs and notifications in the technology specific OAM
       data model.

4.1.  Importing the Base Model Into the Technology-Specific OAM Model

   YANG allows a module to reference external modules to reuse data
   already defined in those modules.  Therefore a technology-specific
   model can import data from the LIME base model.

   The import statements are used to make definitions available inside
   other modules [RFC6020].  Users who want to develop a technology-
   specific OAM model should import the ietf-gen-oam YANG model with the
   following statements:

   module ietf-xxx-oam {
           namespace "urn:foo:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-xxx-oam";
           prefix xxxoam;

           import ietf-gen-oam {
             prefix goam;
           }
           ......

4.2.  Using "augment" to Insert Additional Data Into the Base Model

   As described in [RFC6020], the "augment" statement defines the
   location in the data model hierarchy where new nodes are inserted.
   By using the "augment" statement, the hierarchy of the LIME base
   model can be extended with new data nodes that express technology-
   pecific parameters to meet the requirements of the respective
   technologies.

   The technology-specific model developer must take care to select the
   right layers and nodes in the LIME base model as anchor points to
   insert these additional data.  For example, assume a technology-
   specific OAM YANG model A.  An "a" node needs to be inserted within
   the MA (Maintenance Association):

   augment /goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA:
             +--a?   foo

   Corresponding YANG encoding:

   augment "/goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA"{
            leaf a{
             type foo
              description
              "foo";
    }
   }

4.3.  Using "identity" and "identityref" to Identify New Technology
      Types

   [GENYANGOAM] uses the "identity" statement to define a new globally
   unique, abstract, and untyped "technology-types" base identity.  As
   described below, each technology-specific module specifies a
   corresponding concrete identity using this base: ipv4, ipv6, vpls,
   nvo3, TRILL, mpls, etc.  [GENYANGOAM] itself defines the ipv4 and
   ipv6 identities.

   [GENYANGOAM] also defines a "command-sub-type" abstract identity for
   different RPC commands, e.g., to distinguish the types of IP ping
   [RFC792], LSP ping [RFC4379], TRILL OAM [TRILLOAMYANG].  Use of this
   identity is optional for most cases.

   The corresponding statements are shown as below.

     identity technology-types {
       description
         "this is the base identity of technology types such as
          vpls, nvo3, TRILL, ipv4, ipv6, mpls, etc";
     }

     identity ipv4 {
       base technology-types;
       description
         "technology of ipv4";
     }

     identity ipv6 {
       base technology-types;
       description
         "technology of ipv6";
     }

     identity command-sub-type {
       description
         "defines different rpc command subtypes, e.g rfc792 IP
          ping, rfc4379 LSP ping, TRILLOAMYANG trill OAM, this is
          optional for most cases";
     }

     identity icmp-rfc792 {
       base command-sub-type;
       description
         "Defines the command subtypes for ICMP ping";
       reference "RFC 792";
     }

   With the base identity of technology types and command-sub-type,
   ietf-gen-oam YANG model users who want to develop a specific OAM
   technology model can define their own technology-types and/or
   command-sub-type identity.

   For example, if we want to define a specific OAM technology YANG
   model A, we could define a corresponding technology-types by using
   following statements:

          identity A {
             base goam:technology-types;
             description
               "Technology A";
           }

Internet-Draft      Applicability of LIME Base Model           June 2015


   With this definition of a technology type A, the technology "leaf"
   under the domains list can reference this new type.

4.4.  Using the Choice and Case Nodes

   YANG allows the data model to segregate incompatible nodes into
   distinct choices using the "choice" and "case" statements.  The
   "choice" statement contains a set of "case" statements that define
   sets of schema nodes that cannot appear together.  Each "case" may
   contain multiple nodes, but each node may appear in only one "case"
   under a "choice".  Note that when an element from one case is
   created, all elements from all other cases are implicitly deleted
   [RFC6020].

   In order to support flexible augment, ietf-gen-oam defined a set of
   choice and case nodes to serve as anchor points for specific OAM
   technologies.  Note that the default values of these nodes -- MD-
   name, MA-name, connectivity-context, flow-entropy, et cetera -- are
   empty.

   For example:

               +--rw MAs
                  +--rw MA* [MA-name-string]
                     ...
                     +--rw (connectivity-context)?
                     |  +--:(context-null)
                     |     +--rw context-null?        Empty

   Corresponding YANG encoding:

       choice connectivity-context {
         default "context-null";
         case context-null {
           description
             "this is a place holder when no context is needed";
           leaf context-null {
             type empty;
             description
               "there is no context defined";
           }
         }
         description
           "connectivity context";

   ietf-gen-oam YANG model users who want to define a specific OAM
   technology model can augment the corresponding choice node by
   defining a new case to carry technology specific extensions.

   For example, for a specific OAM technology YANG model A, an "a" node
   is needed to indicate the connectivity context for this specific OAM
   technology.  To achieve this, it is only necessary to augment the
   connectivity-context choice node in the ietf-gen-OAM YANG model by
   defining a "connectivity-context-A" case as:

   augment /goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA
   /goam:connectivity-context:
         +--:(connectivity-context-A)
            +--a?   foo

   Corresponding YANG encoding:

   augment "/goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA"
   +"/goam:connectivity-context" {
      case connectivity-context-A {
       leaf a{
        type foo;}
       }
      }

4.5.  Define New RPCs and Notifications

   The LIME base model presents three basic RPCs: continuity check,
   connectivity verification and path discovery.  Technology-specific
   OAM models can either extend the existing RPCs and notifications
   defined in the LIME base model or define new RPCs and notifications
   if generic RPCs and notifications cannot be reused to meet their
   requirements.

   For example, a Multicast Tree Verification (MTV) [TRILLOAMYANG] RPC
   command is defined in the TRILL OAM model to verify connectivity as
   well as data-plane and control-plane integrity of TRILL multicast
   forwarding as follows:

5.  Applicability of LIME Model to Various Technologies

   As mentioned above, the ietf-gen-oam model describes the abstract
   common core configuration, statistics, RPCs, and notifications for
   layer independent OAM management.

   Following guidelines stated in Section 4, ietf-gen-oam YANG model
   users can augment this base model by defining and adding new data
   nodes with technology specific functions and parameters into proper
   anchor points of the ietf-gen-oam model, so as to develop a
   technology-specific OAM model.

   With these guidelines in hand, this section further demonstrates the
   usability of the ietf-gen-oam YANG model to various OAM technologies.
   Note that, in this section, we only present several snippets of
   technology-specific data model extensions for illustrative purposes.
   The complete model extensions should be worked on in respective
   protocol working groups.

5.1.  IP OAM

5.1.1.  Technology Type Extension

   The technology types ipv4 and ipv6 have already been defined in the
   LIME base model.  Therefore no technology type extension is required
   in the IP OAM model.

5.1.2.  MEP Configuration Extension

   MEP configuration in the LIME base model already supports configuring
   the interface on which the MEP is located with an IP address.  There
   is no additional MEP configuration extension needed for IP OAM.





Zhuang, et al.          Expires December 30, 2015              [Page 12]

Internet-Draft      Applicability of LIME Base Model           June 2015


   However, IP Ping, traceroute and session monitoring do not use the
   MEPID in their message headers.  Therefore it is important to have
   method to derive the MEPID in an automatic manner with no user
   intervention.

5.1.3.  Connectivity-Context Extension

   In IP OAM, the connectivity-context is a 12 bit VLAN ID.  The LIME
   base model defines a placeholder for connectivity-context.  This
   allows other technologies to easily augment it to include technology
   specific extensions.  The snippet below depicts an example of
   augmenting context-id to include VLAN ID.

   augment /goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA
   /goam:MEP/goam:connectivity-context:
      +--:(context-id-vlan)
         +--rw context-id-vlan?   vlan
   augment /goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA/goam:MEP
   /goam:session/goam:connectivity-context:
      +--:(context-id-vlan)
         +--rw context-id-vlan?   vlan

5.1.4.  RPC Extension

   Technology type in the RPC definition has already been defined in the
   LIME OAM base model.  Therefore no technology type extension is
   required in the RPC definition.  For IP OAM, IP Ping and IP
   Traceroute RPCs need to be supported.  For the IP OAM model, the
   continuity-check RPC with IPv4 or IPv6 as technology type can be
   mapped to the IP Ping RPC, while the path-discovery RPC with IPv4 or
   IPv6 as technology type can be mapped to IP Traceroute.

5.1.5.  ECMP extension

   The flow-entropy parameter in the LIME OAM configuration model is an
   optional parameter.  Since standard IP OAM protocols, e.g., IP Ping
   and Traceroute, don't support ECMP path selection, the flow-entropy
   parameter does not need to be supported in the IP OAM model.

5.2.  IPPM (IP Performance Measurement)

   Editor Note: IP performance measurement (PM) and IP Ping and
   Traceroute are discussed separately based on the [RFC7276]
   classification of OAM technologies.  Although IPPM and IP OAM are
   both applied to the IP network, based on Table 4 of [RFC7276], IP OAM
   does not support performance measurement.  It is necessary to use
   OWAMP and TWAMP, defined in IPPM, for that purpose.

Internet-Draft      Applicability of LIME Base Model           June 2015


5.2.1.  MEP Configuration Extension

   To support IP performance measurement, MEP configuration in the LIME
   base model needs to be extended with:

   o  loss-stats-group: grouping object for loss measurement session
      statistics.

   o  measurement-timing-group: grouping object used for proactive and
      on-demand scheduling of PM measurement sessions.

   o  delay-measurement-configuration-group: grouping configuration
      object for the delay measurement function.

   o  delay-measurement-stats-group: grouping object for elay
      measurement session statistics.

5.2.2.  RPC Extension

   To support IP performance measurement, four RPCs need to be defined
   in the IPPM model:

   o  create-loss-measurement RPC: allows scheduling of one-way or two-
      way on-demand or proactive performance monitoring loss measurement
      sessions.

   o  abort-loss-measurement RPC: allows aborting of currently running
      or scheduled loss measurement session.

   o  create-delay-measurement RPC: allows scheduling of one-way or two-
      way on-demand or proactive performance monitoring delay
      measurement sessions.

   o  abort-delay-measurement RPC: allows aborting of currently running
      or scheduled delay measurement sessions.

5.3.  Ethernet OAM

5.3.1.  Technology Type Extension

   No Ethernet technology type is defined in the LIME base model.
   Therefore a technology type extension for Ethernet technology is
   required in the Ethernet OAM model as follows:








Zhuang, et al.          Expires December 30, 2015              [Page 14]

   identity ethernet {
       base technology-types;
       description
         "ethernet technology";
     }

5.3.2.  MEP Configuration Extension

   MEP configuration definition in the LIME base model already supports
   configuring the interface on which MEP is located with MAC address.
   No additional MEP configuration extension is required.

5.3.3.  Connectivity-Context Extension

   In Ethernet OAM, the connectivity-context is a 12 bit VLAN ID.  The
   LIME base model defines a placeholder for context-id.  This allows
   other technologies to easily augment that to include technology
   specific extensions.  The snippet below depicts an example of
   augmenting context-id to include VLAN ID.

   augment /goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs
   /goam:MA/goam:MEP/goam:connectivity-context:
      +--:(context-id-vlan)
         +--rw context-id-vlan?   vlan
   augment /goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA/goam:MEP
   /goam:session/goam:connectivity-context:
      +--:(context-id-vlan)
         +--rw context-id-vlan?   vlan

5.3.4.  RPC Extension

   Technology type in the RPC definition reuses the ethernet identity
   defined earlier.  For Ethernet OAM, Connectivity check, Loopback and
   linktrace RPCs need to be supported.  The connectivity-check RPC in
   the LIME base model with Ethernet as the technology type can be used
   to represent Ethernet connectivity check.  The base model
   connectivity-verification RPC with Ethernet as the technology type
   can be mapped to Ethernet loopback.  The base model path-discovery
   RPC with Ethernet as the technology type can be mapped to Ethernet
   linktrace.

5.3.5.  ECMP Extension

   The flow-entropy parameter in the LIME OAM configuration model is an
   optional parameter.  Standard Ethernet OAM protocols, i.e.,
   connectivity check, loopback and linktrace do not support ECMP path
   selection, so the flow-entropy parameter does not need to be
   supported in the Ethernet OAM model.

5.3.6.  Relation with Service OAM FM Modules

   Note that Service OAM Fault Management YANG Modules defined in [MEF-
   38] are one example of an Ethernet OAM model, but were developed
   before the LIME base model was proposed.  As a result, the Service
   OAM Fault Management YANG Modules defined in [MEF-38] are not
   compliant with LIME base model nor do they extend from LIME base
   model.

5.4.  TRILL OAM

5.4.1.  Technology Type Extension

   No TRILL technology type has been defined in the LIME base model.
   Therefore a technology type extension is required in the TRILL OAM
   model.  The technology type "trill" is defined as an identity that
   augments the base "technology-types" defined in the LIME base model:

   identity trill{
    base goam:technology-types;
    description
     "trill type";
   }

5.4.2.  MEP Configuration Extension

   The MEP configuration definition in the LIME base model already
   supports configuring the interface of MEP with either MAC address or
   IP address.  In addition, the MEP address can be represented using a
   2 octet RBridge Nickname in TRILL OAM . Hence, the TRILL OAM model
   augments the MEP configuration in base model to add a nickname case
   into the MEP address choice node as follows:

   augment /goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs
   /goam:MA/ goam:MEP/goam:mep-address:
         +--:( mep-address-trill)
         |  +--rw mep-address-trill?  tril-rb-nickname

5.4.3.  Connectivity-Context Extension

   In TRILL OAM, connectivity-context is either a 12 bit VLAN ID or a 24
   bit Fine Grain Label.  The LIME base model defines a placeholder for
   context-id.  This allows other technologies to easily augment that to
   include technology specific extensions.  The snippet below depicts an
   example of augmenting connectivity-context to include either VLAN ID
   or Fine Grain Label.

5.4.4.  RPC Extension

   In the TRILL OAM YANG model, the continuity-check and path-discovery
   RPC commands are extended with TRILL specific requirements.  The
   snippet below illustrates the TRILL OAM RPC extension.

5.4.5.  ECMP Extension

   The flow-entropy parameter in the LIME base model is an optional
   parameter.  Since TRILL supports ECMP path selection, flow-entropy in
   TRILL is defined as a 96 octet field.  The snippet below illustrates
   its extension.

   augment /goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA/goam:MEP

5.4.6.  Performance Management (PM) Extension

5.4.6.1.  MEP Configuration Extension

   To support performance measurement for TRILL, MEP configuration in
   the LIME base model needs to be extended with:

   o  loss-stats-group: grouping statistics object for TRILL Loss
      measurement sessions;

   o  measurement-timing-group: grouping object used for proactive and
      on-demand scheduling of PM measurement sessions;

   o  delay-measurement-configuration-group: grouping configuration
      object for TRILL delay measurement function;

   o  delay-measurement-stats-group: grouping statistics object for
      TRILL delay measurement sessions.

5.4.6.2.  RPC Extension

   To support performance measurement for TRILL, four new RPCs need to
   be defined in the TRILL OAM PM model:

   o  create-loss-measurement RPC: allows scheduling of one-way or two-
      way on-demand or proactive performance monitoring loss measurement
      sessions.

   o  abort-loss-measurement RPC: allows aborting of currently running
      or scheduled loss measurement sessions.

   o  create-delay-measurement RPC: allows scheduling of one-way or two-
      way on-demand or proactive performance monitoring delay
      measurement sessions.

   o  abort-delay-measurement RPC: allows aborting of currently running
      or scheduled delay measurement sessions.

5.4.7.  Usage example

   This part gives a simple example of implementing the TRILL OAM model
   onto network devices.

   The scenario is shown in Figure 2, in which there are two companies:
   A and B.  Both have departments in City 1 and City 2.  Meanwhile,
   different departments within the same company should be able to
   communicate with each other.  However, the communication services of
   these two companies should be segregated from each other.

   To meet the requirements above, two Ethernet Lease line, E-Line-1 and

5.4.7.1.  Ethernet OAM Extension

   To fulfill the Ethernet OAM configuration, the lIME base model should
   be extended by augmenting the connectivity-context and inserting a
   port node in the MEP list.  The snippet below illustrates the
   Ethernet OAM model extension.

5.5.  NVO3 OAM

5.5.1.  Technology Type Extension

   No NVO3 technology type has been defined in the LIME base model.
   Therefore technology type extension is required in the NVO3 OAM
   model.  The technology type "nvo3" is defined as an identity that
   augments the base "technology-types" defined in the LIME base model:

      identity nvo3{
       base goam:technology-types;
       description
        "nvo3 type";
      }

5.5.2.  Sub Technology Type Extension

   In NVO3, since different overlay encapsulation types such as VxLAN,
   NVGRE can be employed, the "technology-sub-type" data node is defined
   and added into the LIME base model to further identify the overlay
   types within the NVO3 model.  Based on it, we also define a
   technology sub-type for VxLAN encapsulation.  NVGRE and GENEVE, sub-
   types can be defined in the same way.

Internet-Draft      Applicability of LIME Base Model           June 2015


   identity technology-sub-type {
             description
               "certain implementations such as nvo3 can have different
                encapsulation types such as vxlan, nvgre and so on.
                Instead of defining separate models for each
                encapsulation, we define a technology sub-type to
                further identify different encapsulations. Technology
                sub-type is associated at the MA level";
           }

        identity technology-sub-type-vxlan {
          base technology-sub-type;
          description
            "technology sub-type is vxlan";
        }
   augment "/goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA" {
          leaf technology-sub-type {
            type identityref {
              base technology-sub-type;
            }
          }
        }

5.5.3.  MEP Configuration Extension

   In NVO3, the MEP address is either an IPv4 or IPV6 address.  In the
   LIME base model, MEP address is defined as an IP address and the same
   definition can be used for NVO3 with no further modification.

5.5.4.  Connectivity-Context Extension

   In NVO3 context-id is a 24 bit virtual network identifier (VNI).  The
   LIME base model defines a placeholder for context-id.  This allows
   other technologies to easily augment that to include technology
   specific extensions.  The snippet below depicts an example of
   augmenting context-id to include VNI.

   augment "/goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA
   /goam:connectivity-context"
            {
               case connctivity-context-nvo3 {
                 leaf vni {
                   type vni;
                 }
               }
            }

5.5.5.  RPC Extension

   In the NVO3 OAM YANG model, the End-Station-Locator RPC command is
   defined.  This command locates an end-station within the NVO3
   deployment.  [PTT -- what other tools are applicable??? Presumably
   one can use ICMP Ping, LSP Ping for CV, and the PM extensions, per
   RFC 7276 Table 4.]

5.5.6.  ECMP Extension

   In NVO3, flow-entropy depends on the technology sub-type, e.g.,
   VxLAN.  Technology sub-type is used to extend the base model to
   specific usage.  The snippet below illustrates the extension for
   VxLAN.

   augment "/goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA
   /goam:flow-entropy" {
          case flow-entropy-vxlan {
            leaf flags-vxlan {
              type flags-vxlan;
            }
            leaf flow-entropy-vxlan {
              type flow-entropy-vxlan;
            }
          }
        }

5.6.  MPLS OAM

5.6.1.  Technology Type Extension

   No MPLS technology type has been defined in the LIME base model,
   hence it is required in the MPLS OAM model.  The technology type
   "mpls" is defined as an identity that augments the base "technology-
   types" defined in the LIME base model:

      identity mpls{
       base goam:technology-types;
       description
        "mpls type";
      }

5.6.2.  MEP Configuration Extension

   In MPLS, the MEP address is either an IPv4 or IPV6 address .  MEP-ID
   is either a 2 octet unsigned integer value or a variable length label
   value.  In the LIME base model, MEP-ID is defined as a variable




Zhuang, et al.          Expires December 30, 2015              [Page 25]

Internet-Draft      Applicability of LIME Base Model           June 2015


   length label value and the same definition can be used for MPLS with
   no further modification.

5.6.3.  Connectivity-Context Extension

   In MPLS context-id is a 24 bit MPLS label.  The LIME base model
   defines a placeholder for context-id.  This allows other technologies
   to easily augment that to include technology specific extensions.
   The snippet below depicts an example of augmenting context-id to
   include per VRF MPLS labels in IP VPN or per CE-PE MPLS labels in IP
   VPN.

   augment "/goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA
   /goam:connectivity-context"
            {
              case connectivity-context-mpls {
                 leaf vrf-label {
                   type vrf-label;
                 }
               }
            }

5.6.4.  ECMP Extension

   Since MPLS supports ECMP path selection, the flow-entropy should be
   defined in MPLS OAM model.  Technology type is used to extend the
   YANG model to specific usage.

   augment "/goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA
   /goam:flow-entropy" {
          case flow-entropy-mpls {
            leaf flags-mpls {
              type flags-mpls;
            }
            leaf flow-entropy-mpls{
              type flow-entropy-mpls;
            }
          }
        }

5.6.5.  Usage Example

   In the MPLS tunnel scenario (see Figure 3): tunnel_1 is a static LSP
   tunnel passing through NE1-NE2-NE4.  It is used to perform LSP PING.
   tunnel_3 is another static LSP tunnel passing through NE4-NE2-NE1,
   used to bring back the LSP PING result.  tunnel_2 is a third static
   LSP tunnel passing through NE1-NE3-NE4, used to perform LSP

   Traceroute. tunnel_4 is a fourth static LSP tunnel passing through
   NE4-NE3-NE1, used to bring back the LSP Traceroute result.
