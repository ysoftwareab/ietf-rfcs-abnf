Internet-Draft         Self-termination Mechanism           October 2009


Abstract

   Anycast has in recent years become popular for DNS servers and widely
   applied to several root nams servers and to other commercial name
   servers.  For Anycast-based DNS service reliability, this documents
   describes the use of self-termination mechanism in Anycast-based DNS
   service operation when the service becomes unavailable due to events
   such as hardware failures

Internet-Draft         Self-termination Mechanism           October 2009


1.  Introduction

   DNS service is one of the most important factors in Internet
   infrastructures.  Anycast-based[1] DNS service [2] has been discussed
   within related areas for providing stable service to the users for
   many years.

   Anycast-based DNS service has generally various advantages such as
   effective dealing with DDoS attack, overcoming the limit of
   authoritative name server's physical numbers and improving service
   stability and performance through a distribution of DNS traffic.
   More good points are described in other related documents.

   For that reason, the number of DNS nodes (e.g., Root DNS, TLD DNS and
   sub-level authoritative DNS) which ancyast-based DNS architecture
   applied has been increased greatly.

   In spite of these merits, one of the problems is that Anycast DNS
   service system would keep advertising of its normal condition even
   when it becomes unavailable.  Particularly, Anycast DNS service with
   no self-monitoring system may not be able to respond to queries
   regionally for some time.

   In order to solve this problem, this documents describes self-
   termination mechanism of interfaces on hosts making queries go out to
   other mirror sites automatically.


2.  Self-termination Mechanism

   As the DNS Server has a trouble in responding to queries, it can be
   self-monitored by using a simple script like the following.  This
   script monitors the behavior of the DNS for 5 times and continuously
   alerts the DNS Administrator.

   The Self-termination process by using OSPF Link State
   Advertisements(LSAs), The DNS server itself could be Self-terminated
   by simply setting down network interfaces(e.g lo0).

   Then queries from the Anycast DNS would be bypassed to the shortest
   alternate Anycast DNS and the DNS Service would be reliable.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document describes a mechanism for self-termination of Anycast
   DNS service on the Internet that can be used to cope with DDoS
   attack.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document is only advisory, and does not have any IANA
   considerations.
