Abstract

   Signature is adopted as the fundamental function in Content-Centric
   Networking (CCN) / Named Data Networking (NDN).  Its service and
   performance rely heavily on the key management (KM) schemes, which
   are the processes to generate, deliver, store, protect, update, and
   revoke cryptographic keys.  This document describes the use scenarios
   and further requirements for KM schemes in CCN/NDN.

1.  Introduction

   Information-Centric Networks (ICN) in general, and Content-Centric
   Networking (CCN) [2] or Named Data Networking (NDN) [3] in
   particular, are the emerging network architectures enabling in-
   network caching and data retrievals through their names.  In CCN/NDN,
   data can be cached at the intermediate routers, close to users for
   reducing delay and redundant bandwidth consumption or for the
   robustness under dynamic network environment.  It has been noticed
   that CCN/NDN is a promising approach for the application scenarios in
   disaster networking [4], video streaming [5], and Internet of Things
   (IoT) [6].

   In CCN/NDN, the basic network operations and these use scenarios with
   in-network data caching and retrievals lead the network to be
   seriously vulnerable under a variety of attacks, such as the
   impersonation attack, malicious-request attack [7][8][9], and the
   data poisoning attack [10][11][12].  The unpredictability of users,
   routers, copy holders, and publishers during data retrievals in CCN/
   NDN poses the novel challenge to design data-centric authentication
   to prevent these attacks.  The novel authentication should enable the
   authentication from any entity in the network, who retrieves or

   caches data, to another entity, who provides or publishes data, in
   contrast to the traditional end-to-end authentication.

   On the other hand, signature is already adopted as the fundamental
   function in CCN/NDN, which promises to achieve the integrity and
   publisher authentication.  It can partially prevent the above attacks
   and but still is insufficient to protect the unpredictable data
   retrievals in CCN/NDN.  Providing such data-centric authentications
   with or without these signatures heavily relies on Key Management
   (KM) schemes, which manage and protect the cryptographic keys
   throughout their lifecycles.  It comprise the procedures to generate,
   deliver, store, protect, update, and revoke cryptographic keys.

   There are many existing proposals of KM schemes in Internet, such as
   Kerberos [14], MSEC [15], X.509 [16], PGP [17], RPKI [18].  They are
   designed to achieve different purposes with centralized or
   decentralized approach based on end-to-end communication paradigm
   within the Internet.  They can only provide the authentications
   between the users and publishers without considering data-centric
   authentication, and are unable to prevent the malicious-request and
   data-poisoning attacks.  Furthermore, they rely on centralized
   servers to acquire keys or certificates, thereby increasing
   authentication delays, which we refer to herein as the delay-
   enlargement problem.  Obviously, they are not suitable for the
   emerging data-centric communication paradigm in CCN/NDN, because of
   different security and performance concerns.

   In this document, we identify the requirements for KM schemes in CCN/
   NDN, which can be built-in to manage the cryptographic keys to
   protect the CCN/NDN basic operations and use scenarios.  Please note
   that providing specific solutions (e.g., KM methods for data
   retrievals in CCN/NDN) to protect CCN/NDN communications and
   applications is out of scope of this document.

      objects.  It is also known as in-network cache.

3.  KM Basics, CCN/NDN Operations, and Use Scenarios

   In CCN/NDN, a KM scheme should be designed to incorporate with a set
   of routers, consumers, and publishers to collectively protect the
   CCN/NDN operations and applications.  This section describes the KM
   basic procedures, the CCN/NDN operations, and the typical use
   scenarios to be protected.

3.1.  KM Basic Procedures

   A KM scheme provides the foundation for the authentication services
   in the network operations and applications.  A KM scheme should
   include the procedures for the generation, delivery, storage,
   protection, update and revocation of cryptographic keys or
   certificates, which are provided as follows.

   o  P1 (Key Generation): A KM scheme should explicitly identify the
      involved entities, the trust relations among them, and the
      responsibilities for them.  The cryptographic keys are generated
      based on the initial trust relations.  For the public key

Internet-Draft           Req. for KM in CCN/NDN               March 2018


      approach, the KM scheme should also define the certificate
      issuance from the trustworthy entities.

   o  P2 (Key Agreement): It is the procedure to enable more than one
      entity to create shared key(s), where public key approach is
      normally used.

   o  P3 (Key/Certificate Delivery): A KM scheme should provide methods
      to deliver the generated keys or the issued certificates to the
      corresponding entities, which should follow the pre-defined trust
      relations in P1.

   o  P4 (Key/Certificate Revocation): A KM scheme should provide the
      method to revoke the cryptographic key or the certificate, when it
      is compromised.

   o  P5 (Key Storage): A KM scheme should provide secure method to
      protect the keys from compromisation when storing them.

   o  P6 (Key/Certificate Update): Keys or certificates are generated
      and are valid during a period, after which they should be updated
      for the extension of service.

   o  P7 (Key Backup): A KM scheme should provide method to backup the
      keys and enable the recovery of them when necessary, such as loss
      of keys.

   o  P8 (Compromise Recovery): A KM scheme should enable the
      notification to user for the compromisations and the replacement
      of the compromised keys.

3.2.  CCN/NDN Operations

   CCN/NDN provides name-based data retrievals as in Fig. 1.  It further
   requires the data-centric authentication, instead of the end-to-end
   secure channel establishment in the current Internet.

     Figure 1: Request and reply messages forwarded by consumer, copy
                            holder and routers.

   Regarding the ICN architectures, several typical ICN architectures,
   including DONA [19], PURSUIT [20], CCN/NDN [2][3], and NetInf [21],
   have been proposed.  Among these work, CCN/NDN mainly focuses on the
   opportunistic close information copy discovery and retrieval through
   data-name-based routing.  CCN/NDN shows its promising features on the
   low delay and traffic cost with the expense of in-network cache
   memories and it is the main focus of this document.

   In a CCN/NDN network, each router in a CCN/NDN network has three main
   data structures: a FIB for forwarding Interests, a CS for caching
   data, and a PIT for forwarding data.  Basically there are two types
   of packets: interest and data.  As in Fig. 1, consumer requests data
   by throwing an "interest" packet with the name of data to the
   network.  Regarding the difference to note here between CCN [2] and
   NDN [3] is that in later versions of CCN, interest packet must carry
   a full data name, while in NDN it may carry a data name prefix.

   Once a router receives an "interest" packet, it performs a series of
   the following look-up.

   The router first checks in the CS to see whether it holds the
   corresponding data or not.  If there is, it returns the data through
   the reverse path for forwarding interest packet as the copy holder in
   Fig. 1.  If not, it performs a look-up of the PIT.  If there is
   already a PIT entry matching the name of requested data, it is
   updated with the incoming interface of this new request and the
   interest is discarded.  If there is no matching entry, it creates an
   entry in the PIT that lists the data name and the interfaces from
   which it received the interest.  Then, the interest undergoes a FIB
   lookup to discover the outgoing interface.

Internet-Draft           Req. for KM in CCN/NDN               March 2018


   Once a copy of the "data" packet is retrieved, the router sends it
   back to the data requester(s) using the trail of PIT entries and
   remove the PIT state every time that an interest is satisfied.
   Additionally, it may store the data in its CS.

   However, data retrieval with in-network caching in CCN/NDN has been
   identified to suffer from malicious data-request attacks [7][8][9],
   and the data poisoning attacks [10][11][12].  In the former,
   adversaries impersonate consumers to create a flood of interests, and
   in the latter, they impersonate copy holders (e.g., routers or
   publishers) to provide fake data.  These attacks are severe, because
   data are cached in a distributed manner, and copy holders have no way
   to verify consumers' identities, and consumers/routers have no way to
   verify copy holders' identities to avoid caching fake data.  This
   form of attack can quickly pollute the router caches as the virus
   spreads, because routers cache the fake data, redistribute them, and
   other intermediate routers re-cache them.  It finally consumes much
   in-network caches and prevents consumers from retrieving the correct
   data.  Besides these attacks, the setting of FIB also suffers from
   the fake router announcement.  A KM scheme should be designed to
   provide efficient authentications among routers, copy holders, and
   consumers.

3.3.  CCN/NDN Use Scenarios

   There are many promising use scenarios for CCN/NDN.  Herein we focus
   on three typical use scenarios of ICN, disaster networking, video
   streaming, and Internet of Things (IoT), to explain the security
   issues for them.

   For the disaster networking, [13] has already listed the Emergency
   Support and Disaster Recovery as one of ICN Baseline Scenarios, that
   can be used as a base for the evaluation of different ICN approaches.
   Further, [4] has outline the research directions for using ICN in
   disaster scenario.  In the disaster scenario, communication
   infrastructures in a disaster area are usually fragmented or
   disconnected.  On the other hand, mobile phones and SNS notifications
   show the importance for safety confirmations, rescue notifications,
   and message exchanges.

   In this scenario, the attackers deliberately disseminate or exchange
   the fake information to common users, which may bring out panic.
   Especially, in this scenario, the normal authentications relying on
   centralized servers are usually unworkable and the unpredictable
   separations of network happens frequently.  For the disaster
   networking with CCN/NDN, the data can be cached by the mobile routers
   of the attackers to share with different fragmented networks.  Thus,
   the attackers can disseminate the fake data one by one for different



Li & Asaeda             Expires September 6, 2018               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft           Req. for KM in CCN/NDN               March 2018


   fragmentations.  Disaster networking has similar features as other
   opportunistic networks such as ad hoc network and vehicular networks
   facing similar security issues when applying CCN/NDN.

   Video traffic has already occupy much Internet traffic, which should
   also be an important use scenario for future networks.  Real-time
   communication scenario including video transmission has been listed
   as one of the ICN base scenarios [13] and further the adaptive video
   streaming over ICN has been discussed in [5].  In the video streaming
   scenario, real-time live data transmission and on-demand data
   downloading are two main use cases.  In most times, this scenario has
   much more stricter requirements on the quality of experiences (QoE)
   and low delay for the consumer, and the one-to-many group
   communication paradigm plays fundamental role to provide service for
   video data transmissions.  Additionally, in-network caching video
   data with CCN/NDN helps to improve the performance for video
   transmissions.

   For the video streaming scenario, the digital right management (DRM)
   is one of the most important functions, which protects the incentive
   of video industry.  However, the attacker can impersonate the
   consumers to retrieve data.  If all the consumers are assigned with
   the same key for decryption, any one consumer can illegally
   distribute the key to others, which violates the copyright policy.
   The consumer can illegally get the previous data when he newly joins
   a video service.  Also, she can illegally continue to retrieve the
   data even her key has expired or her service has been terminated.  In
   addition, the cryptographic algorithm should be efficient to enable
   the fluent streaming of video.  These attacks can make the system be
   even worse when targeting at the in-network cached video data.

   IoT has been identified as one of the most important ICN use
   scenarios [13][6].  ICN can provide the benefits to IoT from the
   aspects of naming, caching, optimized transport, efficient data
   retrieval, mobility, and contextual communication services.  For ICN-
   IoT scenario, energy limitation for the resource-constrained devices
   and the heterogeneity on the underlay networks and operators should
   be considered.  The attacker can impersonate sensors to provide fake
   data or impersonate authorized user to collect the sensor data or
   deliberately inject the fake data into the network.

4.1.1.  Functional Requirements

   o  R1 (Data-centric design): Any router or consumer can easily
      authenticate the data, publisher, and copy holder, and any copy
      holder can easily authenticate consumers.

   o  R2 (Secure registration): To guarantee that publishers, users, and
      routers to be securely registered for the binding between name and
      real world identity.

   o  R3 (Efficient revocation): If a key or certificate becomes
      compromised or invalid, it should be revoked from use with low
      cost.

   o  R4 (Efficient key update): Key should be updated periodically,
      which should keep the security level without causing much
      overhead.

   o  R5 (Key/certificate storage and caching): In-Network caching can
      improve the key/certificate distribution efficiency.

   o  R6 (Routing Security): The KM should enable the protection on the
      information exchanges among the routers.

4.1.2.  Performance Requirements

   o  R7 (Low bandwidth consumption): The KM scheme should not increase
      the packet size substantially and should have a negligible impact
      on bandwidth consumption.

   o  R8 (Minimal additional delay): The KM scheme should cause minimal
      (ideally zero) additional delays to data retrieval.

4.2.  Requirements for Protecting Use Scenarios

4.2.1.  Requirements for Protecting Disaster Networking with CCN/NDN

   o  R9 (Availability): KM should be provided to make the
      authentications to data originator be possible, even the network
      is fragmented or disconnected.  It also requires the KM service
      provision among the fragmented or disconnected network partitions
      to enable cross-fragmentation authentications.

   o  R10 (Energy efficiency): KM should not consume much energy of
      mobile devices for data exchange.

Internet-Draft           Req. for KM in CCN/NDN               March 2018


   o  R11 (Robustness): KM should provide methods to bind a new name
      with a real-world identity, because there must be many newly
      assigned terminals for the refugees.

   o  R12 (Revocation synchronization): The revocation for the
      identities should be synchronized for the fragmented networks.

4.2.2.  Requirements for Protecting Video Streaming over CCN/NDN

   o  R13 (Backward and forward secrecy): KM should be provided to
      prevent a new consumer from decrypting the data published before
      it joined the streaming group and prevent a leaving consumer from
      accessing the further video data, even they are provided by the
      servers or in-network caches.

   o  R14 (Light-weight): The KM should be light-weight for video data
      decryption.  If it is a heavy burden for users to decrypt the
      data, the mechanism will not be used.

   o  R15 (Efficient key revocation): The revocation of keys should be
      efficient and prevent the further in-network cached data from
      being decrypted using the compromised or expired keys.

   o  R16 (Scalability): The KM should enable thousands or millions of
      consumers, routers, and publishers.  For example, the olympic
      games or the football games attract huge number of consumers
      simultaneously.

4.2.3.  Requirements for Protecting IoT using CCN/NDN

   o  R17 (Low Energy Consumption): The KM should not consume much
      energy, especially when running on the constraint devices.

   o  R18 (Heterogeneity): The KM should enable the sensor data to be
      provided to the devices over heterogeneous platforms managed by
      different operators .

   o  R19 (Privacy preserving): The KM should protect the privacy of the
      sensor data, even they are cached in the network.
