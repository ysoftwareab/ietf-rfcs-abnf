1.  Introduction 


   This document describes the challenges associated to mobile e-mail.
 
1.1.  Definitions 


   Mobile e-mail is defined as "Access to e-mail while mobile". 


1.1.  Main Expectations
    
   The main expectations for mobile e-mail are:
        - To receive quasi-instantaneous notification of new e-mails when 
        within coverage (if setup this way)
        - To reflect quasi-instantaneously new e-mail or e-mail server events
        in the mobile client when within coverage
        - To send quasi-instantaneously e-mail composed on mobile client from
        appropriate e-mail server when within coverage or as soon that 
        coverage is established otherwise
        - To efficiently manipulate e-mails / drafts / attachment as needed 
        or as preferred 
        - End-to-end secure when needed (e.g. e-mails may at no point be in 
        clear outside enterprise domain)
        - Low or at least bearable cost of usage (e.g. traffic / bandwidth 
        optimization, predictable cost, manageable traffic, ...)
   Note that the notion of quasi-instantenous refers to the impression of the
   user and not to a particular precise duration: the user has the feeling    
   that something happens in a way that is quasi-instantenous. This may be    
   equivalent to some desktop user experience or sometimes be faster or 
   slower than desktop. That is not important as the user can usually not 
   compare. On the other hand, some overall behavior clearly violate this 
   principle (e.g. if the client waits for the user to "browse" its mailbox 
   with a client to download the headers or even the whole messages).


    
1.3.  Additional Considerations
    
    The following considerations are also important for mobile e-mail
    - Format adaptation (attachments, page, ...)
    - DRM rules: how to respect DRM rules like forward lock
    - Provisioning / setup: These are extremely challenging on mobile devices
    with limited or challenging input capabilities. Also average users are    
    more easily confused and unable to correctly setup mobile phones
    - Charging: Operator want to maintain charging to create a viable 
    business model. They may prevent the deployment of mobile email solutions
    that do not permit charging for e-mail services.
    - Synchronization with other clients:
       - e.g. Peer to peer vs. with server (SyncML / OMA DS, ActiveSync, ...)
    - Relationship to PIM (agenda / Address Book)

1.4.  Main Actors
    
   The main actors are:  
      - User
      - Operators of the mobile network
      - E-mail service provider:
        - Service provider (e.g. Operator, other e-mail server provider)
        - Enterprise
 
 
1.4.  Other players in ecosystem
 
   Other actors influence decisions related to mobile e-mail:
        - Device Manufacturers
        - Client software providers
        - E-mail server manufacturers:
                 - E-mail server
                 - Mobile e-mail enablement server
     
 
2. Challenges 
    
 
2.1.  Devices
 
   Devices present the following challenges that directly impact mobile 
   e-mail:
       - Constrained memory / processing power (always improving):
            - Wide range to support
       - Limited battery life (will remain a problem for a long time):
            - Constrains processing capability
            - Constrains connectivity patterns (not always fully connected 
            but may be awaken via outband notifications...)
            - Constraints acceptable bandwidth
       - More exotic platforms:
            - Sometimes proprietary or closed
            - Challenging or controlled software distribution channels:
                - Installing, provisioning, supporting, upgrading,...
                  - E.g. DRM trusted clients
                - Wide range of control models by:
                  - device manufacturer, operator, enterprise, user

2.2. Networks and operators
 
   Mobile networks and operators impose additional constraints that must be 
   taken into account when designing mobile e-mail solutions:
         - Different underlying network technologies / bearers with 
         different behavior / capabilities
         - Intermittent connectivity:
             - Loss of coverage
             - Nature of mobility (e.g. radio turned off in planes)
             - Temporary IP addresses
             - Unreliable delivery (Connection)
         - Out band notification schemes
             - Unreliable
             - But can be used as "wake up / notification scheme"
         - Limited bandwidth:
             - Limited capabilities shared across all users
             - Roaming within and across domain / operators / technologies
         - Cost:
             - Multiple cost models (free, unlimited, per packet, per 
             service / type of service, ...)
             - In general, ... Costly and in need of optimization to maintain
             cost acceptable enough to user and to allow operator to share
             network with enough users.
         - Controlled:
           - Walled garden:
              - Inbound and outbound traffic
              - Internal traffic
           - With itËs own authentication mechanisms etc...
         - Regulated:
           - QoS
           - Privacy
           - Exchanged data
           - Reachability
           - Logging
           - Accountability
           - ...

 2.3. Enterprises and other e-mail service providers
 
   Enterprises must reconcile mobile e-mail deployments with the following    
   requirements:
        - Walled garden intranets:
             - Firewalls, VPN, ...
        - IT Corporate security guidelines:
             - Wide range - in general VERY conservative e.g.
                    - Require end-to-end security
                    - Allowed applications / usages / content
                    - Firewalls / ports / protocols 
                      - (e.g. only HTTP or HTTPS; no SSL/TLS)
                    - No storage of company data outside intranet 
                    (in clear or not). This is why MMS solutions are not 
                    acceptable
         - Regulated:
             - E.g. Journaling / Storage of all corporate e-mails
         - Control usage costs
         - Need to integrate with existing IT infrastructure (instead of 
         replacing them).
 
 
 3. Deployment models
 
   The generic logical architecture and protocol to support mobile e-mail 
   include: 
         - Mobile e-mail server (backend e.g. IMAP server)
         - Connected (e.g. via IMAP) through a "connector"
         - to a mobile e-mail enabling server
            - Connected:
                - Via mobile e-mail protocol to a mobile e-mail client
                - Via other protocols to mobile enablers that support 
                functions like:
                          - Outband notifications
                          - Provisioning
                          - ...
   Firewalls may exist:
         - 1) Between connectors and mobile e-mail enabling server
         - 2) Between:
                - Mobile client and mobile e-mail enabling server
                - Mobile enablers and mobile e-mail enabling server


   Possible deployments include:
      A: Mobile e-mail by operators: "operator hosted e-mail service"
         - Device in network
         - Mobile "enabled" email server in OperatorËs Domain
         - Roaming across compatible networks / operators
      B: Mobile e-mail by E-mail service provider (enterprise, ISP):
         - Device in operator network (including roaming)
         - Mobile "enabled" email E-mail server in service provider

 4. Scope, objectives of Lemonade Mobile Profile: Recommendations
 
   Will lemonade specify the mobile e-mail protocol or  specify a set of 
   optimizations "inspired" from mobile e-mail but not necessarily 
   addressing all these issues?


   We recommend:
      - That Lemonade aims at addressing all the problems identified that 
      are within the scope of IETF.
      - That Lemonade MUST design its protocol to allow use of its messages
      and principles with other transport mechanisms (e.g. HTTP, Outband 
      notification mechanisms, ...) when needed to address some of the mobile
      e-mail challenges identified in this document.
  
Maes                    Expires - April 2005                  [Page 8] 
                             <Mobile e-mail>              October 2004 



Accordingly, Lemonade must not make assumptions on the underlying network 
   transport or design choices that would prevent addressing all these issues
   even if their resolution is outside the scope of OMA.  
  


   This implies in particular allowing: compression and encryption at the 
   application level and possibility to bind Lemonade to HTTP/HTTPS.
    
    
Security Considerations 
    
   The Mobile e-mail protocols must address / support security issues raised 
   by:
        - The different deployment models identified in section 3. In 
        particular:
                - End-to-end security with no message in the clear when the
                mobile e-mail enabling server is outside the e-mail service
                provider domain.
                - No storage of e-mail (in the clear or not) outside the 
                control and domain of the e-mail service provider
                - Secure notifications when relevant information is carried 
                the notifications.
        - Support for the restrictions introduced by the presence of 
        firewalls with constraints typically met in such firewall deployments
        (e.g. corporate guidelines that open only HTTP or HTTPS ports).
