Abstract

   This document defines a number of changes to RFC 2026, the basic
   definition of the IETF standards process.  While some of them are
   definite changes to the rules, the intention is to preserve the main
   intent of the original rules, while adapting them to experience and
   current practice.

Internet-Draft              RFC 2026 Changes                January 2008


1.  Introduction

   BCP 9 [RFC2026] has been the basis for the IETF standards process for
   many years.  RFC 2026 has been in force since 1996, and has proved
   robust and adequately flexible for the main part.  However, some
   provisions have led to practical difficulties or lack clarity.  The
   changes defined here are intended to tackle those issues.

   This document is organized as follows.  Firstly, there is an overview
   of the changes.  Then, the substantive changes are listed and
   explained in textual sequence, illustrated with extracts from RFC
   2026.  Even single-word changes are listed if they are considered
   substantive.  Then, the mandatory sections of any RFC are included.
   Finally, an Appendix lists purely editorial changes in RFC 2026.


2.  Overview of Changes

   This section summarizes the changes made to RFC 2026.  Additional
   explanation is included below, among the details of the changes.
   o  Rationalize the way in which standards are referenced and
      numbered, by:
      1.  Assigning acronyms and numbers to standards at each stage of
          the standards track, not just at the final stage;
      2.  Clarifying in all indexes that more recent standards obsolete
          older ones regardless of their respective stages on the
          standards track;
      3.  Formally abolishing the "STD 1" RFCs.
   o  Tidy up terminology and explanatory text in the standards track
      definition.  The changes are based on the existing three stage
      standards track, with goal of adjusting the rules to make it fully
      workable.
   o  Place responsibility for initiating the advancement or deprecation
      of stalled documents back in the community rather than expecting
      the IESG to do it.
   o  Formalize the reality that non-Working Group documents of any kind
      may be processed by the IETF and approved by the IESG.
   o  Clarify the description of Applicability Statements.
   o  Collate in one place the principles about normative references.
   o  Give the IESG explicit authority to define the granularity of
      interoperability testing.
   o  Simplify the variance process.
   o  Clarify that the appeals process applies to all decisions.

   Additionally, there are several smaller changes that are intended
   only for clarification and alignment with reality.  An Appendix lists
   purely editorial changes.

Internet-Draft              RFC 2026 Changes                January 2008


3.  Detailed Changes

   Extracts from RFC 2026 are presented verbatim in quotation marks,
   preceded and followed by these markers:
   "---------Begin Extract---------
   -----------End Extract---------"
   Proposed changes are presented as plain text.

3.1.  Change to Section 1.1  Internet Standards

   "---------Begin Extract---------

   The Internet Standards Process described in this document is
   concerned with all protocols, procedures, and conventions that are
   used in or by the Internet, whether or not they are part of the
   TCP/IP protocol suite.  In the case of protocols developed and/or
   standardized by non-Internet organizations, however, the Internet
   Standards Process normally applies to the application of the protocol
   or procedure in the Internet context, not to the specification of the
   protocol itself.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   CHANGE: Replace the last sentence by:

   In the case of protocols developed and/or standardized outside the
   IETF, the Internet Standards Process may be applied to the use of the
   protocol in the Internet context.  Similarly, IETF protocols may be
   cited in specifications developed elsewhere.  The IETF will not
   normally modify protocols developed elsewhere, and does not normally
   permit its protocols to be modified elsewhere.

   RATIONALE: The previous text did not allow for the complexity of
   interaction between IETF and non-IETF protocols, nor set the proper
   context for liaison relationships.

3.2.  Changes to Section 2.1  Requests for Comments (RFCs)

   "---------Begin Extract---------

      The status of Internet protocol and service specifications is
      summarized periodically in an RFC entitled "Internet Official
      Protocol Standards" [1].  This RFC shows the level of maturity and
      other helpful information for each Internet protocol or service
      specification (see section 3).

   -----------End Extract---------"

Internet-Draft              RFC 2026 Changes                January 2008


   CHANGE: Delete this paragraph and all other references to STD1.

   RATIONALE: This was written before a hyperlinked index was available
   on line.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

      Some RFCs document Internet Standards.  These RFCs form the 'STD'
      subseries of the RFC series [4].  When a specification has been
      adopted as an Internet Standard, it is given the additional label
      "STDxxx", but it keeps its RFC number and its place in the RFC
      series. (see section 4.1.3)

   -----------End Extract---------"

   CHANGE: Replace the last sentence by:

   When a specification has been approved for publication on the
   standards track, it is assigned a Standard Number (e.g. 10) and a
   Standard Acronym (e.g.  SMTP), independent of its RFC number and its
   place in the RFC series.  As a specification changes status within
   the standards track, its Standard Number remains the same, and is
   associated with the most recent version of the specification,
   regardless of its maturity level.  Historically, RFCs that document
   Internet Standards formed the 'STD' subseries of the RFC series [4].

   Acronyms may comprise sub-acronyms (e.g.  SMTP/Submission) in the
   case of multipart standards.

   RATIONALE: The fact that only full Standards receive an STD number,
   and possibly an acronym, is today a major source of confusion to
   users of the standards, since these numbers and acronyms are not
   associatd with PS and DS documents.  Users do not, in fact, know
   where to look for the latest standard, since a DS may obsolete an
   STD, and a PS may obsolete either.  It would be much less confusing
   if a new or existing acronym was assigned as part of the initial
   standards action (thus RFC 2821 would have been associated with
   SMTP).  Similarly, the STD number should be assigned at PS stage for
   simpler tracking - thus RFC 2821 would also be known as PS10,
   replacing the older RFC 821 previously known as STD10.  (Also see
   comments on section 4.1.3.)

   Not all specifications of protocols or services for the Internet
   should or will become Internet Standards or BCPs.  Such non-standards
   track specifications are not subject to the rules for Internet
   standardization.  Non-standards track specifications may be published
   directly as "Experimental" or "Informational" RFCs at the discretion
   of the RFC Editor in consultation with the IESG (see section 4.2).

   -----------End Extract---------"

   CHANGE: Replace this paragraph by:

   Not all specifications of protocols or services for the Internet
   should or will become Internet Standards or BCPs.  The various paths
   to publication are defined in [RFC4844].  Non-standards track IETF
   specifications may be published as "Experimental" or "Informational"
   RFCs if approved by the IESG.  When non-standards track
   specifications are produced within the IETF, they are subject to the
   rules of the IETF except those specific to Section 5 and Sections 6.1
   through 6.4 of [RFC2026].

   RATIONALE: IETF Experimental or Informational RFCs are distinct from
   independent submissions to the RFC Editor, which are now processed
   under [RFC4846] and [RFC3932], and from IAB [RFC4845] and IRTF
   documents.  Also, we want all IETF documents to be subject to many of
   our rules, such as the IPR rules and the appeals process.

3.3.  Changes to Section 2.2  Internet-Drafts

   "---------Begin Extract---------

     During the development of a specification, draft versions of the
     document are made available for informal review and comment by
     placing them in the IETF's "Internet-Drafts" directory, which is
     replicated on a number of Internet hosts.  This makes an evolving
     working document readily available to a wide audience, facilitating
     the process of review and revision.

     An Internet-Draft that is published as an RFC, or that has remained
     unchanged in the Internet-Drafts directory for more than six months
     without being recommended by the IESG for publication as an RFC, is
     simply removed from the Internet-Drafts directory.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   CHANGE: Replace 'recommended' by 'considered'.

   RATIONALE: Expiry is inhibited when a draft enters IESG
   consideration, not when it is approved.

Internet-Draft              RFC 2026 Changes                January 2008


   CHANGE: Add the following two paragraphs:

   Internet-Drafts are also removed from the directory after publication
   as an RFC.  However, all versions of all Internet-Drafts are retained
   in the IETF archive for legal reasons and may be subject to subpoena.
   Authors should be aware that expired Internet-Drafts are unofficially
   available in many places.  Authors may request expired Internet-
   Drafts to be removed from such availability, but this is outside the
   control of the IETF.

   The published RFC will not be textually identical to the final
   version of the Internet-Draft.  Not only will the required
   boilerplate text be finalized; the RFC Editor will also make
   editorial corrections, and apply minor technical changes approved by
   the sponsoring Area Director or the IESG.

   RATIONALE: Aligning with reality.

3.4.  Changes to Section 3.1  Technical Specification (TS)

   "---------Begin Extract---------

      A Technical Specification is any description of a protocol, service,
      procedure, convention, or format.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   CHANGE: Add the following paragraph:

   Thus a TS is not limited to defining a protocol; it may for example
   define an Application Programming Interface (i.e. a convention) or a
   data definition such as a MIB or an IANA registry (i.e. a format).
   However, a TS must be both implementable and testable.

   RATIONALE: Although clearly within the intended scope of RFC 2026,
   these types of TS have been a source of debate and deserve
   clarification.  Also see later comments on implementation reports.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

   A TS shall include a statement of its scope and the general intent
   for its use (domain of applicability).  Thus, a TS that is inherently
   specific to a particular context shall contain a statement to that
   effect.  However, a TS does not specify requirements for its use
   within the Internet;  these requirements, which depend on the
   particular context in which the TS is incorporated by different
   system configurations, are defined by an Applicability Statement.

Internet-Draft              RFC 2026 Changes                January 2008


   -----------End Extract---------"

   CHANGE: Delete the 3rd sentence.

   RATIONALE: The last sentence very unclear.  Is it saying that a TS
   doesn't contain operational guidelines?  Quite often, the Operations
   Area comments on a draft TS are, in effect, asking for operational
   guidelines.  If a TS refers to a timeout or some other behavioural
   parameter, Operations people may insist on specifying a default value
   and guidance about when to change the default.  But the above
   sentence could suggest that this belongs in a separate AS.  In
   practice, few authors separate such things from the basic
   specification.  The simplest resolution is to drop the whole
   sentence.

3.5.  Changes to Section 3.2  Applicability Statement (AS)

   "---------Begin Extract---------

   An Applicability Statement specifies how, and under what
   circumstances, one or more TSs may be applied to support a particular
   Internet capability.  An AS may specify uses for TSs that are not
   Internet Standards, as discussed in Section 7.


   -----------End Extract---------"

   CHANGE: Insert the following after this paragraph:

   The following description refers to an AS as if it were a separate
   document.  In practice, the applicability information is commonly
   embedded in the relevant TS.

   RATIONALE: The community really doesn't have the habit of writing
   separate AS documents; it's rare, and very rare in WG charters.  Such
   a document has more significance than an Informational document, but
   can only be placed on the standards track along with relevant TSs,
   because it can't be implemented and tested in itself.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

    The broadest type of AS is a comprehensive conformance specification,
    commonly called a "requirements document", for a particular class of
    Internet systems, such as Internet routers or Internet hosts.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   CHANGE: Delete this paragraph.

Internet-Draft              RFC 2026 Changes                January 2008


   RATIONALE: Firstly, this is not the community's normal understanding
   of a conformance specification, which generally refers to product
   certification.  Secondly, in the IETF today, we use the word
   "requirements" much more broadly, typically for an Informational
   document describing the problem to be solved by one or more TS
   documents.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

   An AS may not have a higher maturity level in the standards track
   than any standards-track TS on which the AS relies (see section 4.1).
   For example, a TS at Draft Standard level may be referenced by an AS
   at the Proposed Standard or Draft Standard level, but not by an AS at
   the Standard level.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   CHANGE: Move this paragraph to a new general section on normative
   reference requirements, and rewrite as:

   A standards-track document should not have a higher maturity level in
   the standards track than any standards-track document on which it
   relies normatively.

   RATIONALE: There is nothing specific to ASes in this rule; it is
   applied globally wherever normative references occur.  See comment
   below on 4.2.4.

3.6.  Changes to Section 3.3  Requirement Levels

   "---------Begin Extract---------

      An AS shall apply one of the following "requirement levels" to each
      of the TSs to which it refers:

   -----------End Extract---------"

   CHANGE: Replace by:

   A specification or BCP shall apply one of the following "requirement
   levels" to each specification or BCP to which it refers:

   CHANGE: Throughout the following clauses (a) through (e), read
   "referenced specification or BCP" for each occurrence of "referenced
   TS", and "referring specification or BCP" for each occurrence of
   "AS".

   RATIONALE: There is nothing specific to AS vs TS vs BCP in these

   requirement levels.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

   The "Official Protocol Standards" RFC (STD1) lists a general
   requirement level for each TS, using the nomenclature defined in this
   section. This RFC is updated periodically.  In many cases, more
   detailed descriptions of the requirement levels of particular
   protocols and of individual features of the protocols will be found
   in appropriate ASs.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   CHANGE: Replace the first two sentences by:

   The RFC Editor web site displays the current maturity level of each
   standards track document, as well as the status of all RFCs.

   RATIONALE: Aligning with reality.

3.7.  Changes to Section 4.1.1  Proposed Standard

   "---------Begin Extract---------

     Implementors should treat Proposed Standards as immature
     specifications.  It is desirable to implement them in order to gain
     experience and to validate, test, and clarify the specification.
     However, since the content of Proposed Standards may be changed if
     problems are found or better solutions are identified, deploying
     implementations of such standards into a disruption-sensitive
     environment is not recommended.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   CHANGES:

   1.  Rename PS as Preliminary Standard.

   2.  Add the following text:

   Preliminary Standard is indeed the preliminary level.  Implementors
   should be aware that a PS may be revised or even withdrawn.  However,
   it is nevertheless common to use PS implementations operationally.
   Many documents spend their entire active life as PS.  Certain types
   of specification, e.g. data formats such as MIBs, are likely to be
   recycled at PS as they evolve rather than being promoted.  This may
   be a result of complexity, or due to intrinsic difficulties in
   interoperability testing and normative dependencies.

Internet-Draft              RFC 2026 Changes                January 2008


   RATIONALE: It is well known that to a large extent the warnings about
   PS have been ignored, and that the Internet "runs on Proposed
   Standards."  Also, as the MIB doctors have observed, some types of
   specification may benefit from being recycled at this level rather
   than being "promoted."  The name change makes the status more
   immediately obvious.

3.8.  Changes to Section 4.1.2  Draft Standard

   CHANGE: Rename as Deployable Standard.

   RATIONALE: Just as "proposed" standard is effectively interpreted as
   "preliminary", "draft standard" is effectively interpreted as much
   more than a draft.  Also we have the problem of confusion with
   "Internet-Draft."  The name change reduces this risk of confusion and
   clarifies the factual status.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

    A specification from which at least two independent and interoperable
    implementations from different code bases have been developed, and
    for which sufficient successful operational experience has been
    obtained, may be elevated to the "Draft Standard" level.  For the
    purposes of this section, "interoperable" means to be functionally
    equivalent or interchangeable components of the system or process in
    which they are used.  If patented or otherwise controlled technology
    is required for implementation, the separate implementations must
    also have resulted from separate exercise of the licensing process.
    Elevation to Draft Standard is a major advance in status, indicating
    a strong belief that the specification is mature and will be useful.

    The requirement for at least two independent and interoperable
    implementations applies to all of the options and features of the
    specification.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   CHANGE: Add the following paragraph:

   The IESG is empowered (subject to community consensus) to define the
   level of granularity required in interpreting this requirement, and
   how to demonstrate interoperability for specifications that do not
   define protocols or have a single-ended nature.

   RATIONALE: At least the four significant questions below arise
   repeatedly in interpreting this rule.  It seems best to leave this to
   the IESG and its assessment of community consensus, rather than to
   set rigid rules.

   1.  What is a "feature"?  This can be interpreted in many ways.  For
       a TLV field is every separate type code a feature?  Is every use
       of a normative keyword [RFC2119] a feature?
   2.  Is it acceptable if features A and B are shown to be
       interoperable between implementations X and Y, and features C and
       D are shown to be interoperable between implentations P and Q?
       In that case we have shown interoperability of features A, B, C
       and D but have not shown that any implementation successfully
       interoperates with all of them.

       Since the goal is to use running code to verify that the
       specification in question enables interoperability, not to test
       whether the implementations comply, the answer appears to be yes.
       Also note that as far as validating the specification is
       concerned, all features must be tested, regardless of whether
       they are optional, recommended or mandatory to implement or to
       use.
   3.  Is it acceptable if both implementations X and Y show
       interoperability with implementation Q, but the implementor of Q
       is not party to the tests and does not make any statements about
       features supported?  In other words Q has merely served as an
       active mirror in the tests.
   4.  How should we handle the issue of "single-ended" technical
       specifications such as data formats, where there is no new
       protocol whose interoperation we can verify?  A practical
       solution for MIBs has been documented [RFC2438] and some
       generalisation of this seems to be needed.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

   In cases in which one or more options or features
   have not been demonstrated in at least two interoperable
   implementations, the specification may advance to the Draft Standard
   level only if those options or features are removed.

   The Working Group chair is responsible for documenting the specific
   implementations which qualify the specification for Draft or Internet
   Standard status along with documentation about testing of the
   interoperation of these implementations.  The documentation must
   include information about the support of each of the individual
   options and features.  This documentation should be submitted to the
   Area Director with the protocol action request. (see Section 6)

   designation is intended to provide for the timely publication of a
   very broad range of responsible informational documents from many
   sources, subject only to editorial considerations and to verification
   that there has been adequate coordination with the standards process
   (see section 4.2.3).

   the IESG than other Informational RFCs.

   Change of status shall result in republication of the specification

   desired changes will be "batched" for incorporation at the next level

   standards action on the specification will not always be possible or
   desirable; for example, an important typographical error, or a
   technical error that does not represent a change in overall function
   of the specification, may need to be corrected immediately.  In such

   least the required minimum period plus one year, any participant may
   request the IESG to review the viability of the standardization
   effort responsible for that specification and the usefulness of the
   technology.  Such a request should include a proposed action, with a
   justification and suitable Internet-Drafts if appropriate.  Following
   each such request, the IESG shall approve termination or continuation
   of the development effort.  At the same time the IESG shall decide
   whether to maintain the specification at the same maturity level or
   to move it to Historic status.  This intention shall be communicated
   to the IETF by electronic mail to the IETF Announce mailing list to
   allow the Internet community an opportunity to comment.  This
   provision is not intended to threaten a legitimate and active Working
   Group effort, but rather to provide an administrative mechanism for
   reviving or terminating a moribund effort, and for marking obsolete
   specifications as such.

   RATIONALE: This shifts the responsibility to initiate advancement or
   deprecation of specifications to the community.  No IESG has ever had
   the cycles to initiate such actions, and it is much better practice
   to delegate this responsibility.  It also clarifies the difference
   between normal advancement and the handling of moribund efforts.

    the standardization of protocols and procedures.  It defines the
    stages in the standardization process, the requirements for moving a
    document between stages and the types of documents used during this
    process.  It also addresses the intellectual property rights and
    copyright issues associated with the standards process.

      procedures defined by Internet Standards.  There are also many
      isolated interconnected networks, which are not connected to the
      global Internet but use the Internet Standards.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   "Host-to-host" is strictly accurate, but today we tend to emphasise
   the need for "end-to-end" communication.  Also, our experience is
   that isolated networks tend to get connected sooner or later.
   However, these are subtle questions and it is proposed to delete the
   architectural summary from this process document.

Internet-Draft              RFC 2026 Changes                January 2008


2.1  Requests for Comments (RFCs)

   Each distinct version of an Internet standards-related specification
   is published as part of the "Request for Comments" (RFC) document
   series.  This archival series is the official publication channel for
   Internet standards documents and other publications of the IESG, IAB,
   and Internet community.  RFCs can be obtained from a number of
   Internet hosts using anonymous FTP, gopher, World Wide Web, and other
   Internet document-retrieval systems.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   Remove the reference to gopher.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

   The RFC series of documents on networking began in 1969 as part of
   the original ARPA wide-area networking (ARPANET) project (see
   Appendix A for glossary of acronyms).  RFCs cover a wide range of
   topics in addition to Internet Standards, from early discussion of
   new research concepts to status memos about the Internet.  RFC
   publication is the direct responsibility of the RFC Editor, under the
   general direction of the IAB.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   Add citations of [RFC4844] and [RFC4071].

   "---------Begin Extract---------

      The rules for formatting and submitting an RFC are defined in [5].

   -----------End Extract---------"

   Note that [I-D.rfc-editor-rfc2223bis] is applied today.

   It would probably be better to restate this sentence as:

   The rules for formatting and submitting an RFC are defined by the RFC
   Editor.

3.3  Requirement Levels
...
   (c)  Elective:  Implementation of the referenced TS is optional
      within the domain of applicability of the AS;  that is, the AS
      creates no explicit necessity to apply the TS.  However, a
      particular vendor may decide to implement it, or a particular user
      may decide that it is a necessity in a specific environment.  For
      example, the DECNET MIB could be seen as valuable in an
      environment where the DECNET protocol is used.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   Update the last sentence:

   For example, the MIB for a given protocol could be seen as valuable
   only in an environment where that protocol is used.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

   ...
      Although TSs and ASs are conceptually separate, in practice a
      standards-track document may combine an AS and one or more related
      TSs.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   It would be much clearer to the reader if this was said at the
   beginning of this section.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

4.2.3  Procedures for Experimental and Informational RFCs
...
   Documents proposed for Experimental and Informational RFCs by IETF
   Working Groups go through IESG review.  The review is initiated using
   the process described in section 6.1.1.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   Move up front in this section.

   6.1.3  Publication

      If a standards action is approved, notification is sent to the RFC
      Editor and copied to the IETF with instructions to publish the
      specification as an RFC.  The specification shall at that point be

   "At that point" refers to the moment of publication of the RFC.

 7.1  Use of External Specifications

    To avoid conflict between competing versions of a specification, the
    Internet community will not standardize a specification that is
    simply an "Internet version" of an existing external specification
