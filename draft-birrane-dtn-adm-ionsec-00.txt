1.  Introduction

   An Application Data Model (ADM) provides a guaranteed interface for
   the management of an application or protocol in accordance with the
   Asynchronous Management Architecture (AMA) defined in
   [I-D.birrane-dtn-ama].  The ADM described in this document complies
   with the ADM Template provided in [I-D.birrane-dtn-adm] as encoded
   using the JSON syntax.

   The IONSEC Admin ADM provides the set of information necessary to
   configure and manage the ION security policy database on the local
   computer that is running ION.  This information includes both
   authentication from Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) and Bundle
   Protocol Security (BPSEC).

1.1.  Technical Notes

   o  This document describes Version 0.0 of the IONSEC Admin ADM.

   o  The AMM Resource Identifier (ARI) for this ADM is NOT correctly
      set.  A sample ARI is used in this version of the specification
      and MAY change in future versions of this ADM until an ARI
      registry is established.  This notice will be removed at that
      time.

   o  Agent applications MAY choose to ignore the name, description, or
      other annotative information associated with the component
      definitions within this ADM where such items are only used to
      provide human-readable information or are otherwise not necessary
      to manage a device.

1.2.  Scope

   This ADM specifies those components of the Asynchronous Management
   Model (AMM) common to the manqgement of any instance of an ION node.

   Any Manager software implementing this ADM MUST perform the
   responsibilities of an AMA Manager as outlined in
   [I-D.birrane-dtn-adm] as they relate to the objects included in this
   document.

   Any Agent software implementing this ADM MUST perform the
   responsibilities of an AMA Agent as outlined in [I-D.birrane-dtn-adm]
   as they relate to the objects included in this document.

1.3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Structure and Design of this ADM

   The IONSEC Admin ADM's structure is in accordance to
   [I-D.birrane-dtn-adm].  This ADM contains metadata, table templates,
   and controls.  Table Templates are column templates that will be
   followed by any instance of this table available in the network.
   They may not be created dynamically within the network by Managers.
   Controls are predefined and sometimes parameterized opcodes that can
   be run on an Agent.  Controls are preconfigured in Agents and
   Managers as part of ADM support.  There are no variables, report
   templates, macros, edd, constants, or operators in this ADM at this
   time.  The contents of this ADM are derived from the main functions
   and data that are needed to configure the security policy database on
   the local computer that is running ION and includes both Bundle
   Protocol Security and Licklider Transmission Protocol Authentication.

   All ADMs have metadata that includes the name, namespace, and version
   of the ADM as well as the name of the organization that is issuing
   that particular ADM.  This is important for identification purposes
   of the ADMs and to ensure version control.

   The controls that were chosen to be expressed in this document are
   related to adding, deleting, and modifying security keys.  The
   controls also deal with LTP segment authentication and LTP segment
   signing rules.  The table templates expressed in this document show
   all of the keys and rules that are in the security policy database.

3.  Naming and Identification

   This section outlines the namespaces used to uniquely identify ADM
   objects in this specification.

3.1.  Namespace and Nicknames

   In accordance with [I-D.birrane-dtn-adm], every ADM is assigned a
   moderated Namespace.  In accordance with [I-D.birrane-dtn-amp], these
   namespaces may be enumerated for compactness.  The namespace and ADM
   identification for these objects is defined as follows.

                 +-----------------+---------------------+
                 |    Identifier   |        Value        |
                 +-----------------+---------------------+
                 |    Namespace    | DTN/ION/ionsecadmin |
                 |                 |                     |
                 | ADM Enumeration |          8          |
                 +-----------------+---------------------+

                      Table 1: Namespace Information

   Given the above ADM enumeration, in accordance with
   [I-D.birrane-dtn-amp], the following AMP nicknames are defined.
