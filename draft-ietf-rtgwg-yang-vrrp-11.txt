1.  Introduction

   This document introduces a YANG [RFC6020][RFC7950] data model for
   Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) [RFC3768] [RFC5798].  VRRP
   provides higher resiliency by specifying an election protocol that
   dynamically assigns responsibility for a virtual router to one of the
   VRRP routers on a LAN.

   This YANG model supports both version 2 and version 3 of VRRP.  VRRP
   version 2 defined in [RFC3768] supports IPv4.  VRRP version 3 defined
   in [RFC5798] supports both IPv4 and IPv6.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The following terms are defined in [RFC7950] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  augment

   o  data model

   o  data node

1.2.  Tree Diagrams

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is
   defined in [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-tree-diagrams].

1.3.  Prefixes in Data Node Names

   In this document, names of data nodes, actions, and other data model
   objects are often used without a prefix, as long as it is clear from
   the context in which YANG module each name is defined.  Otherwise,
   names are prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the
   corresponding YANG module, as shown in Table 1.

        +--------+-----------------+------------------------------+
        | Prefix | YANG module     | Reference                    |
        +--------+-----------------+------------------------------+
        | yang   | ietf-yang-types | [RFC6991]                    |
        | inet   | ietf-inet-types | [RFC6991]                    |
        | if     | ietf-interfaces | [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc7223bis] |
        | ip     | ietf-ip         | [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc7277bis] |
        +--------+-----------------+------------------------------+

2.  Design of the Data Model

2.1.  Scope of the Model

   The model covers VRRP version 2 [RFC3768] and VRRP version 3
   [RFC5798] protocols.  The model is designed to be implemented on a
   device where VRRP version 2 or version 3 is implemented.  With the
   help of a proper management protocol, the defined model can be used
   to:

   o  Configure the VRRP version 2 or version 3 protocol.

   o  Manage the protocol operational behavior.

   o  Retrieve the protocol operational status.

   o  Receive the protocol notifications.

2.2.  Relations with Interface Model and IP Model

   This model augments the interface data model "ietf-interfaces"
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc7223bis] and the IP management model "ietf-ip"
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc7277bis].  The augmentation relations are shown
   as follows:


   module: ietf-interfaces
      +--rw interfaces
         +--rw interface* [name]
               ...
            +--rw ip:ipv4!
            |  +--rw ip:address* [ip]
                     ...
            |  +--rw vrrp:vrrp
            |     +--rw vrrp:vrrp-instance* [vrid]
            |        +--rw vrrp:vrid                            uint8
            |        +--rw vrrp:virtual-ipv4-addresses
                           ...
            +--rw ip:ipv6!
               +--rw ip:address* [ip]
                     ...
               +--rw vrrp:vrrp
                  +--rw vrrp:vrrp-instance* [vrid]
                     +--rw vrrp:vrid                            uint8
                     +--rw vrrp:virtual-ipv6-addresses
                           ...


   In the above figure, a tree node without a prefix is from the model
   "ietf-interfaces".  A tree node with prefix "ip:" is from the model
   "ietf-ip".  A tree node with prefix "vrrp:" is from the VRRP model
   specified in this document.

   The "vrrp" container contains a list of vrrp-instance nodes, which
   are instantiated under an interface for a specified address family
   (IPv4 or IPv6).

   Each vrrp-instance node represents a VRRP router state machine
   described in Section 6.4 of [RFC5798], providing the configuration
   and state information for the election process of a virtual router.
   The IP addresses on the augmented interface are the real addresses
   through which the VRRP router operates.  The IPv4 or IPv6 address(es)
   associated with a virtual router (described in Section 1 of
   [RFC5798]) are modeled as a list of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses under the
   vrrp-instance.

2.3.  Protocol Configuration

   The model structure for the protocol configuration is as shown below:


     augment /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv4:
       +--rw vrrp
          +--rw vrrp-instance* [vrid]
             +--rw vrid                            uint8

             |  +--rw interfaces
             |  |  +--rw interface* [interface]
             |  |     +--rw interface             if:interface-ref
             |  |           ...
             |  +--rw networks
             |     +--rw network* [prefix]
             |        +--rw prefix                inet:ipv4-prefix
             |              ...
             +--rw virtual-ipv4-addresses
                +--rw virtual-ipv4-address* [ipv4-address]
                   +--rw ipv4-address    inet:ipv4-address

     augment /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv6:
       +--rw vrrp
          +--rw vrrp-instance* [vrid]
             +--rw vrid                            uint8
             |     ...
             +--rw track
             |  +--rw interfaces
             |  |  +--rw interface* [interface]
             |  |     +--rw interface             if:interface-ref
             |  |           ...
             |  +--rw networks
             |     +--rw network* [prefix]
             |        +--rw prefix                inet:ipv6-prefix
             |              ...
             +--rw virtual-ipv6-addresses
                +--rw virtual-ipv6-address* [ipv6-address]
                   +--rw ipv6-address    inet:ipv6-address


   The model allows to configure the following protocol entities:

   o  VRRP instance (version 2 or version 3), representing a VRRP
      router.

   o  Virtual IPv4 or IPv6 address associated with a virtual router.

   This model conforms to the Network Management Datastore Architecture
   (NMDA) [I-D.ietf-netmod-revised-datastores].  The operational state
   data is combined with the associated configuration data in the same
   hierarchy [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc6087bis].  When protocol states are
   retrieved from the NMDA operational state datastore, the returned
   states cover all "config true" (rw) and "config false" (ro) nodes
   defined in the schema.

   The model allows to retrieve protocol states at the following levels:

   o  VRRP instance (version 2 or version 3), representing a VRRP
      router.

   o  Virtual IPv4 or IPv6 address associated with a virtual router.

   o  Tracking interface, to detect interface connectivity failures.

   o  Tracking network, to detect interface connectivity failures.

   o  Global states and statistics summarizing all instances.

2.5.  Notifications

   This model defines the following VRRP specific notifications:

      +---n vrrp-new-master-event
      |  +--ro master-ip-address    inet:ip-address
      |  +--ro new-master-reason    new-master-reason-type

         |        +--ro vrid    leafref
         +--ro virtual-router-error-reason    identityref


   Each notification type is used to indicate a type of VRRP state
   changes or error occurances:

   vrrp-new-master-event
      VRRP new master event, indicating that a new master has been
      elected.

   vrrp-protocol-error-event
      VRRP protocol error event for a message that fails to reach a VRRP
      instance to be processed.

   vrrp-virtual-router-error-event
      VRRP virtual router error event for a message processed on a VRRP
      instance.

   In addition to the notifications specified above, the mechanism
   defined in [I-D.ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] and
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push] can be used for other general
   notifications.  This mechanism currently allows the user to:

   o  Subscribe notifications on a per client basis.

   o  Specify subtree filters or xpath filters so that only interested
      contents will be sent.

   o  Specify either periodic or on-demand notifications.

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC5246].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC6536] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv4/vrrp:vrrp/vrrp:vrrp-instance

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv6/vrrp:vrrp/vrrp:vrrp-instance

   Unauthorized access to any data node of these subtrees can adversely
   affect the routing subsystem of both the local device and the
   network.  This may lead to network malfunctions, delivery of packets
   to inappropriate destinations, and other problems.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   /ietf-vrrp:vrrp

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv4/vrrp:vrrp/vrrp:vrrp-instance

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv6/vrrp:vrrp/vrrp:vrrp-instance

   Unauthorized access to any data node of these subtrees can disclose
   the operational state information of VRRP on this device.
