                draft-sonoda-dnsop-accept-certificate-00

Abstract

   Full service resolver uses x509 certificate to provide DNS over
   TLS[RFC7858] DNS over DTLS [RFC8094].  This memo describes How to
   accept this certificate.

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                   Mar 2018


1.  Method of using TLSA record - TLSA style

1.1.  full service resolver certificate

   The certificate common name can be decided freely.  Must add full
   service resolver ip addresses to Subject Alternative Name [RFC5280].
   Add TLSA record [RFC7218] of the certificate to full resolver service
   IP address reverse name.  Tha TLSA record MUST validate DNSSec.

1.2.  accepting full service resolver certificate

   Stub resolver begins the TLS handshake and receives Full resolver
   certificate.  If Full service resolver ip not include Subject
   Alternative Name, Stub resolver deny this certificate.  Stub resolver
   requests TLSA record of full resolver service IP address reverse name
   and validates the TLSA recedes itself using.  This process can use
   not safety Server.  If the TLSA recedes are not validate, Stub
   resolver deny this certificate.  If the TLSA recedes are secure and
   The TLSA recedes include recede of handshake certificate, Stub
   resolver can accept this certificate.

1.3.  Distribution and update root trust anchor

   Root trust anchor distribution and update SHOULD update by OS
   periodic update.

2.  Method of using TLS-PKI - HTTPS style

2.1.  full service resolver certificate

   The certificate common name can be decided freely.  Must add full
   service resolver ip addresses to Subject Alternative Name [RFC5280].

2.2.  accepting full service resolver certificate

   Stub resolver begins the TLS handshake and receives Full resolver
   certificate.  If Full service resolver ip not include Subject
   Alternative Name, Stub resolver deny this certificate.  The
   certificate is trusted by root certificate, Stub resolver can accept
   this certificate.

3.  Operational Considerations

   Case of DNSSec chains ot trust is break, TLSA style can't accept new
   certificate.

4.  Security Considerations

   Attack create certificate of full resolver service IP address reverse
   name, HTTPS style can MIM attack.
