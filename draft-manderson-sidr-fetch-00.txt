1.  Introduction

   This document details a mechanism and algorithm for a relying party
   to synchronise a local cache of RPKI objects against the collection
   of original publication points.

1.1.  Terminology

   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the terms and concepts
   described in "Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate
   and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile" [RFC5280], "A Profile
   for X.509 PKIX Resource Certificates" [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs]
   "Manifests for the Resource Public Key Infrastructure"
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-rpki-manifests], "X.509 Extensions for IP  Addresses
   and AS Identifiers" [RFC3779], "Hypertext Transfer Protocol --
   HTTP/1.1" [RFC2616], "HTTP Over TLS" [RFC2818], and related regional
   Internet registry address management policy documents.

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


2.  Overview

2.1.  RPKI Repository

   An RPKI Repository is a collection of RPKI Publication Points.

2.2.  Publication Points

   A Publication Point is the location where RPKI objects exist for
   public use.  The Publication Point also contains a manifest of all
   the RPKI objects that are published at that location.  The
   Publication Point URI is held in the SIA of the RPKI Certificate that
   signed the objects at that Publication Point.

2.3.  RPKI Manifests

   A manifest is a signed object, listing of all of the RPKI objects at
   a publication point in the RPKI Repository, excluding the manifest
   itself.  The manifest contains the file name and a hash of the
   contents of the RPKI object file.

   The URI to the manifest exists in the manifest SIA from the
   Certificate that signed the manifest.

Internet-Draft                    RRRM                      October 2008


   Manifest validation SHOULD be done according to "Manifests for the
   Resource Public Key Infrastructure" [I-D.ietf-sidr-rpki-manifests].

2.4.  Object URI

   The object location URI is constructed by using the Publish Point
   from the Signing RPKI Certificate SIA and the File (name) in the
   manifest signed by the Signing RPKI Certificate.  The exception to
   this is the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate and manifest
   relationship.

2.5.  CA and Manifest Relationship

   In the situation that the certificate in focus is the Certificate
   Authority (CA) certificate:

   o  Like all RPKI certificates [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs] the CA
      contains a SIA that identifies a Publish Point and a Manifest.

   o  The CA signs an End Entity (EE) Certificate for the single purpose
      of signing the CA manifest.

   o  The EE certificate has an SIA that also identifies the manifest.

2.6.  Traversing a RPKI Repository

   A generalised RPKI hierarchy structure of a resource repository,
   including the out of band collected Trust Anchor (CA), can be
   represented as:

   The following broad algorithm MAY be used to traverse the hierarchy,
   starting with the Trust Anchor or CA RPKI Certificate.

   1.  Collect the manifest referenced in the id-ad-rpkiManifest
       [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs] Manifest AccessMethod of the SIA of the
       Certificate.

   2.  Collect, from the Publication Point, every valid object listed in
       the manifest.

   3.  For each subordinate object with id-ad-signedObjectRepository
       [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs] and id-ad-rpkiManifest access method
       SIA values repeat fom step 1.

   Processing of each subordinate Publish Point MAY be done in parallel,
   provided sufficient RPKI material has been collected for Manifest and

   RPKI validation.


3.  Transport Protocol

3.1.  HTTPS

   When transferring a RPKI objects HTTPS [RFC2818] based transfers MUST
   be used in order to ensure the integrity of the repository site or to
   encrypt the retrieval of the RPKI objects.  Various HTTPS methods MAY
   be used to minimise the number of simultaneous fetches and data
   transfers over the transport connection.  It is further recommended
   that the RRRM client make efforts to reduce the number of
   simultaneous connections such that a balance exists between the
   number of open TCP connections and the number of objects retrieved
   per connection for each publication point.

3.2.  Other Protocols

   The retrieval algorithm specified in this document can also be used
   by other protocols as an effecient way to synchronise the RPKI
   repository with a local cache, provided HTTP specifics such as (and
   not limited to) redirects, http pragma, connection behaviours and
   pipe-lining are addresed.


4.  Retrieval

4.1.  Retrieval Algorithm

   If the SIA for the Publish Point of the RPKI Certificate Authority
   (CA) Certificate or End Entity Certificate defines a HTTPS access
   method in the URI then the following algorithm MAY be used by a
   Retrieval Client for any initial and subsequent fetch of certificates
   and signed outcomes (objects) from an RPKI Repository Server (RRS).

4.1.1.  Post-Fetch Validated (PFV)

   a.  Fetch the appropriate manifest [I-D.ietf-sidr-rpki-manifests]
       from the RRS.  The RC MAY maintain the connection to the RRS with
       a persistent connection.

   b.  Confirm the manifest's validity.

       *  If the manifest is invalid, or the manifest is empty,
          terminate processing and close any RRS connections

Internet-Draft                    RRRM                      October 2008


   c.  Construct a list of URIs to be retrieved by comparing hash values
       in the downloaded manifest, with the hash values of the locally
       cached object:

       *  If a local manifest does not exist then all objects contained
          in the manifest MUST be listed for retrieval.

       *  If an object entry in the downloaded manifest does not exist
          locally, the URI SHOULD be added to the retrieval list.

       *  If an object exists locally and does not appear in the
          manifest, it SHOULD be deleted from the local cache.

       *  If the hash value of the object in the downloaded manifest
          does not match the hash value of the local copy of the object,
          the URI of the object SHOULD be added to the retrieval list.

       *  If the retrieval list is empty, terminate processing and close
          any RRS connections.

   d.  Fetch the list of objects using pipe-lined GET requests.

       *  HTTP redirects SHOULD be honoured by the client and followed
          using a separate RRS connection for the object if located at a
          different RSS endpoint.

   e.  Confirm that all of the objects listed in the downloaded manifest
       have been retrieved.  Should one or more objects fail to
       retrieve, it is then a matter of local cache policy to continue
       with the intent of RPKI validating retrieved objects.  The client
       (and cache policy) should realise that it would be unlikely that
       enough RPKI information would then exist locally to fully
       validate objects from that publication point, and as such
       processing in this condition may be wasteful.  It is also
       possible that an object may have been removed from the
       publication point between retrival of the manifest and the
       attempted retrieval of the object.

   f.  Confirm the hash of the downloaded object file contents matches
       the hash stored in the downloaded manifest

       *  If the hash does not match, the object MAY be newer than the
          manifest and the object SHOULD be RPKI validated.

   g.  Close any RRS connections.

   h.  RPKI Validate the retrieved objects and store the validated
       objects in the local cache.

5.  Client Considerations

5.1.  Hash Comparison

   As described in the PFV algorithm, if the hash does not match, the
   object may be newer than the manifest.  It is RECOMMENDED that
   suitable warnings be generated by the retrieval client to alert to
   any issues of a hash mismatch.

5.2.  Hash Mismatch

   To minimise the occurrences of hash values that do not match, the RC
   MAY consider postponing retrieval of a RPKI Repository for some
   period of time either side of the "nextUpdate" time detailed in the
   manifest.


6.  Acknowledgements

   Due recognition needs to be given to all the individuals involved in
   the inter-RIR Resource Certificate working group.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.


8.  Security Considerations

8.1.  RRS and Manifest Integrity

   A scenario exists where a malicious attack could place an invalid
   RPKI certificate on the RRS in the Publication Point prior to the
   manifest creation.  While this does not represent a high risk to the
   overall Resource Certificate system as the object will fail to
   validate, it may affect the Relying Party as:

   o  An object is extremely large and RC retrieval of the object may
      cause resource, network, or other types of congestion.

   o  Many invalid objects, which the RC must download, may affect
      overall performance or the RC or the overall Resource Certificate
      system.
