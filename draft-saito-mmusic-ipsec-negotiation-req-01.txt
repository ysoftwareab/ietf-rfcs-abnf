Abstract 
    
   As the Internet grows, it becomes inevitable even for the general 
   users to take measures against the security risks such as tapping, 
   unauthorized access, and so on. For example, we can consider the use 
   case of networked home appliances which cannot have the rich 
   calculation resources and may use the dedicated transport protocol 
   for the media session. In such a case, it is effective to connect 
   such devices securely using IPsec [1] because it does not require the 
   rich resources, and is independent of the upper layer protocol. Also 
   from the viewpoint of implementation, IPsec is not only widespread in 
   IPv4, but also mandatory in IPv6 which is expected in the networked 
   home appliances region. 
    
   However, it is necessary to set up a lot of option parameters 
   properly in order to establish the IPsec connection. And it requires

   the technical knowledge even if using IKE, which does it 
   automatically. At least, IKE is not so simple that the general users 
   who do not know the security well can handle. 
    
   By the way, SIP [2] mechanism, which has a function of flexible 
   negotiation, enables the different applications to connect to each 
   other easily by negotiating the codec, frame rate, and so on. On the 
   other hand, we found out the similarity between IPsec configuration 
   and parameter configuration for media session, and we thought to 
   negotiate the parameters for IPsec easily with using SIP. 
   Particularly, if the application itself supports SIP by nature, there 
   should be more merits. 
    
   In this document, we provide some use cases of IPsec communication 
   systems. Then we explain what kind of IPsec parameters should be 
   negotiated on SIP. Note that we assumed that the system users are 
   end-users who are not familiar with IPsec. This document also offers 
   the candidate methods to realize it, including the existing specs, 
   and which one we should take among them.

1. Introduction and Problem Statement 
    
   Various applications which use different protocols are increasing now, 
   so that the security of them is also required more and more. On the 
   other hand, SIP is considered as the de facto standard to invoke the 
   application sessions. We can use it for not only VoIP applications 
   but also general applications now. And the general users, in other 
   words, the people who do not have sufficient knowledge about security, 
   began to want the secure and easy communication tools. On the other 
   hand, the sessions invoked by SIP applications also need security 
   features, such as end-to-end authentication and/or encryption. In 
   fact, several security methods have already been offered. For example, 
   there are key exchange frameworks in order to encrypt the media 
   session, such as MIKEY [4], Key Management Extensions for SDP and 
   RTSP [5], SDP Security Descriptions [6], and so on. However so far, 
   these frameworks mainly support the specific use such as SRTP for 
   VoIP sessions although it may be applicable to general protocols. The 
   usage for the other protocols hasn't been defined yet. 
    
   However, considering the general applications (ex. networked home 
   appliances), they often use the dedicated protocol in order to 
   provide their unique functions as their own value. In addition, some 
   data transferred between home appliances will need the security in 
   order to be hidden from other users. In such a case, SRTP cannot be 
   used for the security protocol because it is strongly combined with 
   VoIP applications. On the other hand, there is a choice to use IPsec 
   that is independent of media and applications. IPsec is recognized as 
   the standard security protocol of the IP layer, and has sufficient 
   interoperability. 
    
   On the other hand, as shown in IKE, IPsec has a practical issue that 
   the configuration of its option parameters is so complicated. It 
   often prevents the applications from making use of IPsec. But the 
   most applications only want to use IPsec with ease, and they would 
   not require more than the recommended sets of parameters which are 
   believed to be sufficiently secure (Some devices can not support a 
   lot because of the resource restriction). In fact, the combination of 
   parameter sets which are secure and do not have a problem in 
   interoperability are limited, therefore we thought it would be 
   sufficient to choose one of them. Besides, it makes sense to make use 
   of SIP and an offer/answer model with the SDP [7] in order to resolve 
   the name, authenticate, and decide the media session when the devices 
   start the communication. And more, if we negotiated even the IPsec 
   parameters inside this mechanism, the problem could be reduced 
   compared with negotiating them after the start of media session. 
   Actually, if doing it after the start of media session, the first 
   data of UDP based media would be lost.

   Therefore in this document, we describe the issues on applying IPsec 
   to the application sessions invoked by SIP, and we also describe the 
   requirements to solve them. 
    
2. Application Scenarios 
    
   We assume the situation that network devices such as home appliances 
   connect to each other easily. And we call that style of communication, 
   M2M: Machine-to-Machine Communications. We assume the following 
   conditions on our model scenarios. 
    
   o  Trusted 3rd Party (CM: Communication Manager) 
   
       To simplify the mutual authentication between devices, we have 
       the special SIP proxy server, which we call "CM (Communication 
       Manager)". It works as both REGISTRAR and Trusted 3rd Party. The 
       signaling channel between CM and the device is protected by 
       IPsec. And they are authenticated by each other using Pre-Shared 
       Key and so on. Therefore, all the contents of all the SIP 
       messages are protected in that communication path. And as the 
       trusted 3rd party, CM assures the authentication between devices 
       instead of them. 
    
   o  Mutual Trust between DOMAIN CMs 
    
       Each CM has the DOMAINs, which is the group of users who can be 
       authenticated by that CM. All CMs have the strong mutual trust 
       based on the contract, and the communication path between them 
       is sufficiently secure. 
    
   o  Key Exchange through the Signaling Channel 
    
       Each device will not have any pre-shared secrets to establish 
       the end-to-end secure communication in advance. These secrets 
       should be retrieved using the in-direct secure signaling channel 
       provided by CM. By the way, SIP messages are transmitted only 
       via CMs which have the relationships of trust as described above. 
    
   Under the above conditions, we built two model scenarios for examples. 
    
2.1. Remote Control 
    
   Let us think about the automated home security system. The user wants 
   to communicate with the devices in his house, such as a door lock, 
   the monitor cameras, and so on over the Internet. In this scenario, 
   the user can control these security devices, using the control 
   terminal, from outside of his house. Both the control terminal and 
   the security devices REGISTER to the CM with which the user has the

              Requirements for IPsec Negotiation in SIP  October 2005 
 
 
   contract, therefore they can call each other with the SIP message. 
   However, there is no limitation in the choice of the media between 
   them. In other words, the arbitrary protocols could be used for the 
   media session. In fact, they totally depend on the application. By 
   the way, although the control terminal and the security devices are 
   authenticated by the CM using pre-shared key, each peer (a pair of 
   the terminal and the device) cannot authenticate each other directly. 
   Figure 1 shows the network structure in this scenario.

        Figure 1: Network Structure in Remote Control Scenario 
    
2.2. Visual Communication 
    
   The next scenario is the visual communication a.k.a. the video chat, 
   between the users who are friends. In this scenario, two users may be 
   inside their houses respectively with their terminals, and each 
   terminal is connected to the Internet directly, or via the home 
   router. Each terminal REGISTERs to the "domain CM" which each user 
   belongs to. Each terminal can be mutually called through the secure 
   path for the SIP communication. The media exchanged by them may be 
   mainly voice and video, but there is no limitation in the choice. 
   Therefore the arbitrary protocols could be used for the media session 
   although it is mainly RTP (they totally depend on the application.) 
   Each terminal can authenticate its domain CM mutually, but each peer 
   (a pair of terminals) does not share any secrets in advance. Note 
   that all the domain CMs are connected to each other securely. Their 
   relationships are guaranteed out-of-bounds, i.e. by the agreement 
   between ISPs. Figure 2 shows the network structure in this scenario.

3. System Requirements 
    
   In the above scenarios, we can point the several factors necessary 
   for the system. Particularly, we focus on the following factors in 
   this document. 
    
3.1. Security 
    
   It is important to assure the security both in the remote control and 
   in the visual communication. As for the security, we think the 
   following requirements. 
    
   o  Authentication of the Peer 
 
       All the SIP nodes MUST be authenticated by each other before 
       they start the end-to-end session. They have to eliminate the 
       attackers who pretend to be the legitimate node. 
 
   o  Integrity of the Data 
 
       The integrity of all the session data MUST be assured. It 
       prevents the malicious person from tampering the media data 
       directly exchanged between the legitimate nodes. 
 
   o  Confidentiality of the Data 
 
       The contents of the session data SHOULD be hidden from the un-
       trusted nodes. Therefore, the encryption of the session data 
       will be required.

              Requirements for IPsec Negotiation in SIP  October 2005 
 
 
   o  Access Control 
 
       The access from the un-desired person such as a spammer SHOULD 
       be blocked. The function of access control mainly means the 
       simple packet filtering here. But in addition, we also think it 
       effective to hide the existence of the own node from the un-
       desired people. Even the disclosure of SIP-URI or IP address of 
       the own node may raise the potential risk of DoS attacks. 
       However, we decided this problem is out of scope, since we 
       should solve it within the whole framework of SIP including 
       location services. 
 
   o  Update of Secret Keys 
 
       The secret keys used for authentication or encryption SHOULD be 
       updated periodically. Even if the peers are properly 
       authenticated and the end-to-end session between them is 
       encrypted, there still remains the risk that the attacker may 
       try all possible keys, that is to say, "brute force attack". 
       This requirement also includes the generic functions supported 
       by the generic key-exchange process, such as derivation of the 
       key, negotiation of SAs, choice of the cipher algorithm and so 
       on. 
 
3.2. Impact on Implementation and Users 
    
   o  Reduction of Resources 
 
       The implementation cost SHOULD be reduced while keeping the 
       system security high. As shown in the scenario of the remote 
       control, some devices used for M2M access do not have the rich 
       resources. We think it is important reducing the functions to 
       implement. In addition, the calculation load of each function 
       should be low. 
 
   o  Actions of Users or Implementers 
 
       From the user's point of view, the input from the user is 
       RECOMMENDED to be minimum. And from the implementer's point of 
       view, the protocol based on the readable text is RECOMMENDED 
       because it is easy to debug. 
 
3.3. Connectivity 
 
   o  Connectivity Issues Caused by the Network Environment 
 
       All the above scenarios have the connectivity issues that depend 
       on the network environment. In particular, NATs and Firewalls 
       often block the end-to-end communication. In order to get those

              Requirements for IPsec Negotiation in SIP  October 2005 
 
 
       over, each node may need to negotiate the various parameters 
       related to the environment or use the other services such as 
       STUN [8] and TURN [9]. 
 
   o  Interoperability of the Protocol 
 
       The interoperability of the protocol used for the end-to-end 
       session is also the important factor. 
 
   o  Scalability 
 
       It may be necessary to think the scalability of CM, for example, 
       the sustainable number of signaling channels between the 
       terminals and CM. But we assume the SIP signaling channel is 
       stably established between the nodes and CMs because it has been 
       already discussed a lot about the scalability in the existing 
       SIP framework. 
 
3.4. Generic Use 
    
   The choice of the transport protocols used for the end-to-end session 
   between terminals is not limited. It will depend on the upper layer 
   applications. If we have to provide the different security protocols 
   for each transport protocol, it means the waste of resources. 
   Therefore, we think it desirable to use the standard, all-purpose 
   security protocol for the IP applications such as IPsec. 
    
 
4. Protocol Requirements 
    
   Considering the above requirements, we thought it proper to use IPsec, 
   which does not require the rich resources and is recognized as the 
   standard security protocol. In this section, we describe the protocol 
   requirements when applying IPsec to the media session invoked by SIP. 
    
4.1. Security 
    
   IPsec is designed to fill the most of the requirements with security 
   functions such as, access control, connectionless integrity, data 
   origin authentication, protection against replays (a form of partial 
   sequence integrity), confidentiality (encryption), and limited 
   traffic flow confidentiality. The behavior of IPsec is controlled 
   based on SAs (Security Associations). 
    
   By the way, the above security functions of IPsec are controlled by 
   pre-defined SAs: Security Associations. Therefore, it is necessary to 
   negotiate SAs prior to starting the actual M2M media sessions. For 
   example, the following SA parameters MUST be shared between the nodes.

              Requirements for IPsec Negotiation in SIP  October 2005 
 
 
   o  SPI (Security Parameter Index: ID for SA) 
 
   o  IPsec Mode (tunnel mode or transport mode) 
 
   o  Lifetime of SA 
 
   o  Encryption Algorithm (in case of ESP) 
 
   o  Authentication Algorithm 
 
   o  Compression Algorithm in IPComp 
 
   o  A Pair of IP Addresses That IPsec Applied 
 
   In addition, it is necessary to share and update the secret between 
   the nodes. This is one of the system requirements described in 3.1. 
   To achieve it, the following parameters will be necessary. 
 
   o  Secret Data: Given to PRF 
 
   o  PRF (Pseudo-Random Function): Session keys will be derived from 
      "Master" secret with PRF 
 
   o  Key Rounds State of PRF 
 
   According to the specification of IPsec [10][11], Sequence Number 
   field (32 bits) is used for cryptographic calculation. Therefore, the 
   secret key SHOULD be updated before 2^32 packets are sent. 
    
4.2. Impact on Implementation and Users 
    
   For saving the bandwidth and the user interaction, the mechanism that 
   makes the IPsec-SA negotiation settled easily SHOULD be introduced, 
   and the roundtrip for the negotiation SHOULD be minimum (hopefully 
   one roundtrip). It SHOULD fit the offer-answer model of SDP 
   negotiation [7], which will reduce the interaction between the nodes.  
    
4.3. Connectivity 
 
   o  Connectivity Issues Caused by the Network Environment 
 
       The network environment such as NAT/FW influences the IPsec 
       communication as well as other protocols. However since this 
       issue is not specific to IPsec, we decided that this issue is 
       outside of the scope, although recognizing the issue. 
 
   o  Interoperability of the Protocol

              Requirements for IPsec Negotiation in SIP  October 2005 
 
 
       In order to gain the interoperability of IPsec, The parameter 
       sets (such as the mode of security, the set of supporting cipher 
       algorithms, and so on) SHOULD be pre-defined, and at least one 
       SHOULD be chosen as mandatory to implement. 
 
   o  Scalability 
 
       We assumed the scalability of CM is kept as described in 3.3. 
       However, if we choose the solution that the CM manages all the 
       state of IPsec connections and secret keys for the media 
       sessions, we must consider the processing load and the data 
       capacity of the CM to host the reasonable number of nodes. 
 
4.4. IPsec for Generic Use 
    
   From the viewpoint of network management, it is preferable to be able 
   to share IPsec SAs between media sessions invoked by the single 
   INVITE request. In order to share the SA information across the 
   multiple media, IPsec parameters MUST be defined independently of the 
   media.  
 
5. Possible Solutions 
    
   In this section, we describe the possible solutions for our 
   application models including the existing specifications. 
    
 
5.1. Security 
    
   There are the following existing specifications which can be used for 
   negotiating the IPsec SA parameters. 
 
   o  IKE 
 
       IKE [12] is one of the widespread standard specifications of 
       IPsec key-exchange. However, since it includes a lot of 
       available functions, the implementation is not light and the 
       interoperability is not always fine. On the other hand, it is 
       efficient to exchange the key for the media session in the SDP 
       simultaneously with the media negotiation. 
 
 
   o  Key-Exchange Using Kerberos (KINK) 
 
       There is a light-weighted key exchange mechanism, KINK [13]. In 
       this mechanism, the traffic and the calculation cost can be 
       reduced with using the secure key-distribution server. On the 
       other hand, it is too large a task to build and operate the 
       Kerberos system in addition to the SIP platform. And it is

              Requirements for IPsec Negotiation in SIP  October 2005 
 
 
       difficult to make the new framework of assuring the end-to-end 
       connectivity of KINK, and binding KINK and the media sessions of 
       SDP. 
 
   o  Key-Exchange Using SDP 
 
       The frameworks such as MIKEY [4] and Key Management Extensions 
       [5], or SDP Security Descriptions [6] are offered. But if SDP is 
       not secure end-to-end in these mechanisms, the key information 
       MUST be encrypted in the SDP. Therefore it is necessary for the 
       nodes to do the cipher calculation based on the public-key 
       method or pre-shared key method for the key-exchange. In other 
       words, the key-exchange protocol itself is tunneled over SDP. 
       This condition makes the implementation large, and it is 
       difficult to distribute the certificates to all the nodes or to 
       make them share the full-mesh pre-shared keys. 
        
       However if there is the assumption that SDP is securely 
       protected (particularly Security Descriptions is designed on 
       this case), the key exchange could be fairly simple. On the 
       other hand, the present specification of Security Descriptions 
       only defines the profiles for SRTP. Therefore it is necessary to 
       modify the specification or add the profiles in order to express 
       the SA information such as "RTP over IPsec" and so on. In 
       addition, there may be a case that the port number of SA becomes 
       different from that of the media transport by applying the 
       tunneling, i.e. UDP encapsulation of IPsec, etc. Therefore it 
       will be necessary to think the mechanism to support such a 
       situation. 
    
   By the way, as for the update of the secret keys, we think there are 
   following possible methods. 
 
   o  Method-1: re-INVITE 
 
   o  Method-2: Key Derivation at the Pre-defined Timing 
 
   If the update of the secret key seldom occurs since the most sessions 
   finish before it, it may be suitable to use Method-1. However, it 
   generally costs to use SIP signaling channel, and the nodes must take 
   care of synchronization with the media sessions.  
    
   In contrast, Method-2 is useful if the key-update is frequently 
   occurred. The SPI and "session" key will be updated when certain 
   amount of IP packets are sent. But Sequence Number is usually managed 
   by IP layer, and it might be difficult to check its value from 
   application layer.

5.2. Impact on Implementation and Users, and Connectivity 
    
   We think there are following possible approaches which reduce the 
   implementation and raise the interoperability. 
 
   o  IPsec key exchange in a round-trip by using the offer/answer model 
      of SDP. 
 
   o  Defining the "parameter suites". 
 
       The parameter suites are the pre-defined sets of the SA 
       parameters, which are frequently chosen. This concept will help 
       to settle the negotiation compared with the negotiations on 
       individual parameters. And it may be effective to choose the 
       light-weight cipher algorithm. 
 
5.3. Generic Use 
    
   At the same time, in order to share the single IPsec SA between 
   multiple media which invoked by single INVITE request, it SHOULD be 
   possible to bind IPsec parameters with the session (session level of 
   SDP), not only with the media (media level of SDP). 
 
6. Conclusions 
    
   We evaluated the existing protocols, but there was no protocol which 
   met our requirements completely. The closest candidates were key-mgt 
   and the SDP Security Descriptions I-D. However the former needs the 
   new format for IPsec key exchange, and the latter requires the 
   additional definition of transport specific parameters and the 
   standard format to express the IPsec SA information. 
    
   Therefore we want to build a new specification to negotiate IPsec-SA 
   parameters based on offer/answer model of SDP with reflecting the 
   feedbacks from IETF community. That will specify the call-sequences 
   of IPsec-SA negotiation and define the required data formats 
   including IPsec-SA suites. 
 
7. Security Considerations 
    
   This document focuses on the key-exchange process of IPsec, but from 
   the view point of security, the following features must be considered, 
   too. 
 
   o  Trusted 3rd Party 
 
       There remains the issue how a user can make sure of trusted 3rd 
       party in order to simplify the process of end-to-end security. 
       At least the disclosure of data by way of the CM must be avoided.

              Requirements for IPsec Negotiation in SIP  October 2005 
 
 
       Generally, it is supposed that a trustworthy organization such 
       as ISP would manage the CM. However it would be necessary to 
       make a contract which legally prohibits the disclosure of the 
       confidential information. Because the CM can be a man-in-the-
       middle potentially, it is an essential factor to have a 
       relationship of trust between the user and the CM. 
 
   o  Hiding the Existence of Node 
 
       By hiding the existence of the own node from the un-desired 
       people, the risk of DoS attacks can be reduced. Such a mechanism 
       may be realized using a trusted 3rd party, but it requires more 
       discussions including the framework of SIP and location service. 
 
   o  SA Management Related to Applications 
 
       IPsec is a per-host basis security protocol. Therefore we need 
       the mechanism that the application can invoke IPsec SAs, and 
       that manages all IPsec SAs not to conflict with each other. For 
       example, when plural applications generate the IPsec SAs which 
       have the different security levels respectively, the application 
       data must be transmitted by the IPsec SAs which are generated by 
       the same application. Therefore it will require the SA 
       management mechanism related to applications.
