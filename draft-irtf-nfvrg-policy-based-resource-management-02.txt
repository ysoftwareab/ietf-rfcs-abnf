1.  Introduction

   NFV "Point of Presence" (PoP) will be likely constrained in compute
   and storage capacity.  Since practically all NFV PoPs are foreseen to
   be distributed, inter-datacenter network capacity is also a
   constraint.  Additionally, energy is also a constraint, both as a
   general concern for NFV operators, and in particular for specific-

5.1.  MANO Architecture

   According to the ETSI MANO framework [ETSI-NFV-MANO], an NFVO is
   split into two functions (see Figure 1):

   o  The orchestration of NFVI resources across multiple VIMs,
      fulfilling the Resource Orchestration functions.  The NFVO uses
      the Resource Orchestration functionality to provide services that
      support accessing NFVI resources in an abstracted manner
      independently of any VIMs, as well as governance of VNF instances
      sharing resources of the NFVI infrastructure

   o  The lifecycle management of Network Services, fulfilling the
      network Service Orchestration functions.

   Similarly, a VIM is split into two functions (see Figure 1):

   o  Orchestrating the allocation/upgrade/release/reclamation of NFVI
      resources (including the optimization of such resources usage),
      and

   o  managing the association of the virtualised resources to the
      physical compute, storage, networking resources.

   In Figure 2 we show various policies mapped to the MANO architecture
   (see Section 5.2 for more dicussions on policies in the MANO
   architeture):

   o  Tenant Policies: Tenant policies exist whenever a domain offers a
      virtualization service to more than one consumer.  User tenants
      may exists at the northbound of the NFVO.  Additionally, if a VIM
      exposes resource services to more than one NFVO, then each NFVO
      may appear as a tenant (virtualization consumer) at the northbound
      of the VIM.

   o  Wherever virtualization services are produced or consumed
      corresponding export and import policies may exist.  Export
      policies govern the details of resources, capabilities, costs,
      etc. exposed to consumers.  In turn, consumers (tenants) apply
      import policies to filter, tweak, annotate resources and services
      received from their southbound domains.  An entity may at the same
      time consume and produce virtualization services hence apply both
      import and export policies.

   o  Operational policies support the business logic realized by the
      domain's ownership.  They are often associated with Operations or
      Business Support Systems (OSS or BSS) and frequently determine
      operational objectives like energy optimization, utilization
      targets, offered services, charging models, etc.  Operational
      policies may be split according to different control plane layers,
      for example, i) lifecycle and ii) resource management layers
      within the NFVO.

5.2.  Policies in the MANO Architecture

   The current industry work in the area of policy for NFV is mostly
   considered in the framework of general cloud services, and typically
   focused on individual subsystems and addressing very specific use
   cases or environments.  For example, [ETSI-NFV-WHITE-PAPER] addresses
   network subsystem policy for network virtualization, [ODL-GB-POLICY]
   and [ODL-NIC-PROJECT] are open source projects in the area of network

   policy as part of the OpenDaylight [ODL-SDN-CONTROLLER] software
   defined networking (SDN) controller framework, [RFC3060] specifies an
   information model for network policy, [VM-HOSTING-NET-CLUSTER]
   focuses on placement and migration policies for distributed virtual
   computing, [OPENSTACK-CONGRESS] is an open source project proposal in
   OpenStack [OPENSTACK] to address policy for general cloud
   environments.

   A policy framework applicable to the MANO architure must consider NFV
   services from the perspective of overall orchestration requirements
   for services involving multiple subsystems (e.g., Figure 1 and
   Figure 2).

   While this document discusses policy atributes as applicable to the
   MANO architecture, the general topic of policy has already been
   intensively studied and documented on numerous publications over the
   past 10 to 15 years (see [RFC3060], [POLICY-FRAMEWORK-WG], [RFC3670],
   [RFC3198], and [CERI-DATALOG] to name a few).  This document's
   purpose is to discuss and document a policy framework applicable to
   the MANO architecture using known policy concepts and theories to
   address the unique requirements of NFV services including multiple
   PoPs and networks forming hierarchical domain architectures
   [SDN-MULTI-DOMAIN].

   With the above goals, this document analyses "global versus local
   policies" (Section 5.3), a "hierarchical policy framework"
   (Section 5.4) to address the demanding and growing requirements of
   NFV environments, a "policy pub/sub bus in the hierarchical
   framework" (Section 5.5), "policy intent versus subsystem actions"
   (Section 5.6), "static versus dynamic versus autonomic policies"
   (Section 5.7), "policy conflict detection and resolution"
   (Section 5.8), and "soft versus hard policy constraints"
   (Section 5.9), which can be relevant to resource management in
   service chains [RESOURCE-MGMT-SERVICE-CHAIN].

5.3.  Global vs Local Policies

   Some policies may be subsystem specific in scope, while others may
   have broader scope and interact with multiple subsystems.  For
   example, a policy constraining certain customer types (or specific
   customers) to only use certain server types for VNF or Virtual
   Machine (VM) deployment would be within the scope of the compute
   subsystem.  A policy dictating that a given customer type (or
   specific customers) must be given "platinum treatment" could have
   different implications on different subsystems.  As shown in
   Figure 8, that "platinum treatment" could be translated to servers of
   a given performance specification in a compute subsystem and storage
   of a given performance specification in a storage subsystem.

   Policies with broader scope, or global policies, would be defined
   outside affected subsystems and enforced by a global policy engine
   (Figure 3), while subsystem-specific policies or local policies,
   would be defined and enforced at the local policy engines of the
   respective subsystems.

   Examples of sub-system policies can include thresholds for
   utilization of sub-system resources, affinity/anti-affinity
   constraints with regard to utilization or mapping of sub-system
   resources for specific tasks, network services, or workloads, or
   monitoring constraints regarding under-utilization or over-
   utilization of sub-system resources.

5.4.  Hierarchical Policy Framework

   So far, we have referenced compute, network, and storage as
   subsystems examples.  However, the following subsystems may also
   support policy engines and subsystem specific policies:

   o  SDN Controllers, e.g., OpenDaylight [ODL-SDN-CONTROLLER].




Szabo, et al.              Expires May 3, 2017                 [Page 10]

Internet-Draft               Policy-based RM                October 2016


   o  OpenStack [OPENSTACK] components such as, Neutron, Cinder, Nova,
      and etc.

   o  Directories, e.g., LDAP, ActiveDirectory, and etc.

   o  Applications in general, e.g., standalone or on top of
      OpenDaylight or OpenStack.

   o  Physical and virtual network elements, e.g., routers, firewalls,
      application delivery controllers (ADCs), and etc.

   o  Energy subsystems, e.g., OpenStack Neat [OPENSTACK-NEAT].

   Therefore, a policy framework may involve a multitude of subsystems.
   Subsystems may include other lower level subsystems, e.g., Neutron
   [OPENSTACK-NEUTRON] would be a lower level subsystem in the OpenStack
   subsystem.  In other words, the policy framework is hierarchical in
   nature, where the policy engine of a subsystem may be viewed as a
   higher level policy engine by lower level subsystems.  In fact, the
   global policy engine in Figure 3 could be the policy engine of a Data
   Center subsystem and multiple Data Center subsystems could be grouped
   in a region containing a region global policy engine.  In addition,
   one could define regions inside regions, hierarchically, as shown in
   Figure 4.

   Metro and wide-area network (WAN) used to interconnect data centers
   would also be independent subsystems with their own policy engines.

5.5.  Policy Pub/Sub Bus

   In [I-D.irtf-nfvrg-nfv-policy-arch] the authors argued for the need
   of policy subsystems to subscribe to policy updates at a higher
   policy level.  A policy publication/subscription (pub/sub) bus would
   be required as shown in Figure 6.

                      Figure 6: A Policy Pub/Sub Bus

   A higher tier policy engine would communicate policies to lower tier
   policy engines using a policy pub/sub bus.  Conversely, lower tier
   policy engines would communicate their configured policies and
   services to the higher tier policy engine using the same policy pub/
   sub bus.  Such communications require each policy pub/sub bus to have
   a pre-defined/pre-configured policy "name space".  For example, a
   pub/sub bus could define services using the name space "Platinum",
   "Gold", and "Silver".  A policy could then be communicated over that
   pub/sub bus specifying a Silver service requirement.

   In a hierarchical policy framework, a policy engine may use more than
   one policy pub/sub bus, e.g., a policy pub/sub bus named "H" to
   communicate with a higher tier policy engine and a policy pub/sub bus
   named "L" to communicate with lower tier policy engines.  As the name
   spaces of policy pub/sub buses H and L may be different, the policy

   engine would translate policies defined using the policy pub/sub bus
   H name space to policies defined using the policy pub/sub bus L name
   space, and vice-versa.

5.5.1.  Pub/sub bus in the hierarchical framework

   Figure 7 shows the Pub/sub bus in the hierarchical MANO framework.
   Policy communications would employ a policy pub/sub bus between the
   subsystems' policy engines in the policy hierarchy (see Section 5.4).
   The global NFVO subsystem should have visibility into the policies
   defined locally at each PoP to be able to detect any potential global
   policy conflicts, e.g., a local PoP administrator could add a local
   policy that violates or conflicts with a global policy.  In addition,
   the global NFVO subsystem would benefit from being able to import the
   currently configured services at each PoP.  The global NFVO would use
   such information to monitor global policy conformance and also to
   facilitate detection of policy violations when new global policies
   are created, e.g., a global level administrator is about to add a new
   global policy that, if committed, would make certain already
   configured services a violation of the policy.  The publication of
   subsystem service tables for consumption by a global policy engine is
   a concept used in the Congress [OPENSTACK-CONGRESS] OpenStack
   [OPENSTACK] project.

          Figure 9: Operational policies for resource management

   The use of NFVI resources for multiple network services can be
   optimized in various objectives as defined in the operational
   policies (as described in Section 5.2).

   The operational policies can be split to different layers of NFVO and
   VIM/WIM and they include 1) resource scheduling (RS) policy, resource
   adaptation (RD) policy and authentication, authorization, accounting
   (AAA) policy at NFVO, and 2) resource allocation (RA) policy and

   resource embedding (RE) policy at VIM/WIM.  They can be mapped to the
   MANO architecture as shown in Figure 9.

5.10.1.  Operational Policies at NFVO

   During NS/VNF lifecycles, states of NFVI/WAN resources or the
   performance of VNF and VL instances may vary in time (e.g., the
   performance degradation due to incorrect placement or incorrect
   forwarding action).  Another concern for such dynamic changes is
   fail-over as a fundamental consideration, i.e., physical resources or
   virtualized resources in NFVI may fail during network services.
   These dynamic changes significantly could affect the overall
   performance for NS.  Therefore, such dynamic changes triggered during
   NS/VNF lifecycles should be coped with for guaranteeing the NS
   performance and the optimized resource usage.  Figure 9 shows that
   NFVO needs to enforce resource adaptation (RD) policy as an
   operational policy at NFVO.  RD policy supports how NFVO adapts the
   allocated NFVI/WAN resources (e.g., VM migration, scaling) by dealing
   with triggered variations.  RD policy engine can detect the changes
   from measurement and diagnosis from VNFM and/or VIM/WIM.

   Figure 9 also shows that NFVO needs to enforce resource scheduling
   (RS) policy.  RS policy determines the locations of VNF and VL
   instances that constitute NS across multiple PoPs and WANs while
   optimally allocating NFVI and WAN resources to the instances.

   In particular, RD and RA policies would consider a business model
   from OSS/BSS which specifies operational (or business) objectives
   (e.g., overall energy consumption and NFVI resource utilization)
   within its domain and with taking account of (on-boarded) network
   service descriptor (NSD) as an NS policy including the virtualization
   aspects of application feature, QoS parameters, affinity, anti-
   affinity rules, and so on.

   On the one hand, for the user authorization, authentication,
   authorization, accounting (AAA) policy may be needed.  Authentication
   policy provides a way of identifying a user while the authorization
   policy determines whether the user has the authority for virtualized
   resources (i.e., NFVI/WAN resources) to receive the network service
   or not.  Accounting policy measures the resources the user consumes
   during the network service.  This can include the amount of system
   time/data, and so on.

5.10.2.  Operational Policies at VIM/WIM

   As shown in Figure 9, RA policy supports how each subsystem (e.g.,
   compute, storage subsystem) in NFVI is allocated depending on the
   placement information from NFVO to further optimize the resource

   usage.  Moreover, the assigned NFVI resources are embedded (or
   allocated) to physical resources in VIM/WIM depending on states and
   usage of resources by means of resource embedding (RE) policy as
   shown in Figure 9.  In other words, RE policy determines and
   coordinates how the allocated virtual resources are mapped to
   physical resources.  For example, RE policy may be updated when some
   physical resources are failed or a virtualization technique is
   changed.

        ### NFP



                 Figure 10: Policy-based VNF-FG Management

   Another subsystem example for the policy framework is VNF-FG.  When
   VNF-FGs of end-to-end network services are realized, NFVI resources
   across multiple NFVI-PoPs and WAN resources that connect among them
   should be allocated to the VNF-FGs.  It depends on the target KPIs of
   individual VNF and VL instances that constitute VNF-FGs.  In
   particular, in case of VNF-FG, chained performances and capabilities



Szabo, et al.              Expires May 3, 2017                 [Page 21]

Internet-Draft               Policy-based RM                October 2016


   of VNF and VL instances need to be considered together with on VL
   instances the inter-connectivity between different NFVI-PoPs.  For
   example, if one of the VNF instances or VL instances along the VNF-FG
   gets overloaded, the end-to-end network service may also get
   affected.  Therefore, while features of such VNF-FG are carefully
   considered, proper operational policies for resource management (see
   Section 5.10) are required.

   As shown in Figure 10, consider a scenario where a user requests a
   VNF-FG composed of "VNF A-VL 1-VNF B-VL 2-VNF C".  For the VNF-FG, an
   RA policy is enforced in which it is designed to avoid over-
   utilization of PoP A and to reduce latency on VL 1.  Therefore, NFVO
   places VNF A, VNF B, and VL 1 on PoP A by consuming its computing and
   network resources to achieve low latency.  On the other hand, VL 2
   and VNF C is allocated to the resources of WAN and PoP B,
   respectively to avoid over-utilization of PoP A.

   On the one hand, dynamic changes such as a VNF failure significantly
   affect on the overall performance of VNF-FG since VNF-FG is a chain
   of VNF and VL instances.  Thus, such dynamic changes should be coped
   with by RD policy for guaranteeing the VNF-FG performance and the
   optimized resource usage.  A fault management for VNF-FG based on
   policy example is shown in Section 6.4.

         Figure 12: Architecture for policy-based fault management

   As shown in Figure 11, consider a scenario that a VM related to VNF-B
   (i.e., a VNF-B instance) is failed in the given VNF-FG composed VNF-
   A, VNF-B, VNF-C in order.  Note that the NFVI and WAN resources are
   already allocated to the instances by RS policy.  For service
   continuity, failure of the VNF-B instance needs to be detected based
   on diagnosis function in VIM/VNFM and the failed one needs to be
   replaced with a new instance or to be assigned to the existing
   instance which is available.  The diagnosis and measurement function
   may collect current performance measures and location for instances
   as well as such a failure event.

   high possibility of failure.  Therefore, NFVO could instantiate VNF B

   shown in Figure 14, and the corresponding NS can be continued without
   re-instantiation.
