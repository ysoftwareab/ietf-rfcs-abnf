1.  Introduction

   Networks are turning on consumable objects by external applications
   and services.  In order to facilitate that, it is necessary to expose
   the capabilities offered by the networks in such a way that the
   applications and services can produce informed decisions that assist
   in the improvement of the service delivery.

   Thus it is convenient to define mechanisms for capabilities exposure
   that could provide required information for IETF networks.  ALTO
   [RFC7285] can play such a role.  This memo describes existing and
   foreseen capabilities that can be exposed by leveraging on ALTO.

2.  Exposing network capabilities for enhancing service delivery

   More and more, services and applications rely on information
   retrieved from the network in order to make decisions positively
   affecting the service delivery, by adapting the applications to the
   reality observed through the retrieved information.  This information
   is typically offered by specific components in the network with the
   mission of aggregating, processing and securely exposing such
   information.

Internet-Draft   ALTO as IETF Network Exposure Function     October 2021


   Several initiatives are being developed in order to facilitate such
   exposure of capabilities and information at different network levels.
   For example, 3GPP defines the Network Exposure function (NEF)
   [TS29.522] as a secure, scalable and simplified exposing tool for
   capabilities (as well as events) supported by the 5G Core (5GC)
   network.  Main capabilities of NEF are the following:

   o  Securely expose 3GPP Network Functions (NFs) capabilities to
      Application Functions (AF).

   o  Secure provision of information to 5GC, including authentication
      and authorization to AF.

   o  Rate limit AF access to 5GC functions and information, including
      charging functions.

   o  Translation of internal-external information, e.g. identities.

   This is done though a number of APIs defined in [TS29.522].  A
   specific NEF instance may support only a subset of the APIs specified
   for capability exposure.

   Further examples are present in other network concerns.  Thus, in
   ETSI Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) group a number of APIs allow
   the retrieval of specific network information at the edge (e.g.,
   location API [MEC-013]), or the O-RAN Alliance which is working on
   exposing information to applications running on top of the non-real
   time Radio Informacion Controller (RIC) [O-RAN].

   The purpose of this document is to consider ALTO as the means for
   exposure of underlay network capabilities to multiple overlays on top
   of the network.  In other words, serve as "ground truth" from the
   network provider perspective to the applications consuming network
   capabilities in the scope of IETF.

3.  ALTO versus network controller conceptualization

   A relevant question that could arise is about the difference on
   purpose between ALTO and a network controller in the network.

   Primarily, the final purpose of these components is quite different.
   In this respect, a network controller (i.e., SDN controller
   [RFC7149]) can be seen as the element devoted to orchestration,
   control and management of the network assets, that is, the component
   in charge of administering network objects.  Typically, a network
   controller leverages on another IETF functional component used for
   network control, such as the Path Computation Element (PCE)
   [RFC4655], which is used to compute paths for forwarding purposes

   based on network constraints.  In contrast to these two elements,
   ALTO acts as a "one-stop-shop" for retrieving (and correlating)
   network related information, potentially leveraging on the
   capabilities of the othe rtow (i.e., SDN controller and/or PCE).

   Moreover, ALTO has been included as part of some architectural
   frameworks, such ABNO [RFC7491], with the mission of allowing joint
   network and application-layer optimization precisely by exposing to
   applications an abstract network topology containing only information
   relevant to such application.  In this manner the application can
   take an informed decision and request specific control actions in the
   network.

4.  Modes of usage

   This section presents different modes of usage of ALTO network
   exposure capabilities to improve network operations.  Some of these
   usages can be implemented nowadays based on existing specifications,
   while a set of other use cases is considered as prospective since
   more specification work is yet needed in IETF.

4.1.  Existing use cases

   This subsection presents a number of use cases already described that
   can leverage on ALTO as IETF Network Exposure Function.

4.1.1.  Network topology and reachability

   The basic ALTO capabilities [RFC7285] provide network maps associated
   with costs in a manner that for any pair of source and destination
   can be retrieved information about topology and reachability.  This
   can be considered as the fundamental or baseline information on top
   of which the other modes of usage are built on.

4.1.2.  Network performance metrics per path

   Extensions defined in [I-D.ietf-alto-performance-metrics] permit the
   reporting of standard-based performance metrics associated to the
   paths generated in the network map.  With that view, applications
   consuming ALTO (i.e., ALTO clients) can determine the performance
   expectation for the possible paths between an origin and a
   destination.  Thus, not only puere cost but also performance can be
   considered as an element for decision.

Internet-Draft   ALTO as IETF Network Exposure Function     October 2021


4.1.3.  Segmented paths and associated characteristics

   Original ALTO concentrates on end-to-end paths.  However it may
   result of interest to get knowledge of specific parts of the end-to-
   end paths that could produce problems such as e.g. congestion.  Then,
   having means of segmenting the end-to-end paths becomes useful.
   [I-D.ietf-alto-path-vector] allows for that defining a new
   abstraction called Abstract Network Element (ANE) to represent
   components constituting an entire end-to-end network path as a vector
   of ANEs.

4.1.4.  In-time view of dynamic IP addressing allocation

   Some architectures allow for dynamic allocation of IP address subnets
   across the network.  An example of that is the Control and User Plane
   Separation (CUPS) architecture for Broadband Network Gateways (BNGs)
   [I-D.wadhwa-rtgwg-bng-cups], [TR-459].  In that architecture, the
   control place of the BNG has the possibility of dynamically assigning
   IP address subnets to different elements distributed in the network,
   acting as user plane functions of the BNG.  This dynamic allocation
   implies that certain IP prefixes could be allocated in different
   parts of the network along the time.  By means of ALTO and its
   network map is it possible to obtain an up-to-date view of the
   topological location of each subnet in runtime, facilitating the
   optimization of some services (e.g. media distribution) in an
   automated manner.

4.2.  Prospective use cases

   This subsection presents a number of use cases that could be enabled
   by ALTO as IETF Network Exposure Function.

4.2.1.  Determination of optimal compute facility taking into account
        network information

   ALTO can be used as a component to provide insights on the
   reachability of suitable compute facilities.  An initial case has
   been documented in [I-D.contreras-alto-service-edge].  The rationale
   for this case is that ALTO receives information of connected compute
   capabilities in terms of e.g.  CPU, memory and storage.  This
   information can be put together with the network map, in a way that
   the cost of reaching those capabilities can be easily determined.

   Note that if further information apart of cost is included in the map
   (e.g., performance metrics) then the resulting information provided
   to applications becomes enriched.

4.2.2.  Visibility of underlying network information in overlay networks

   Different overlay networks run today leveraging the connectivity
   provided by the basic underlying transport network.  Since specific
   situations on the transport network can result in relevance for the
   service being provided by the overlays, it is crucial to facilitate
   the observation of such situations from the underlay to the overlay.

4.2.2.1.  Cellular case

   Mobile networks leverage transport networks to connect mobile access
   nodes with core management and control entities (e.g., for mobility
   management, policing, etc), running in an overlay mode through
   tunneling (i.e., the GTP protocol).  [I-D.li-alto-cellular-use-cases]
   presents the benefits of exposing network information for
   applications running on access devices of a cellular network.

4.2.2.2.  Media distribution case

   Media delivery systems, as traditional CDNs, deliver content to end-
   users in an over-the-top fashion.  The key aspect for an efficient
   and optimal delivery of the content is to select the proper delivery
   point for whatever end-user requesting it is to have a clear view of
   the network topology (including the associated costs or any other
   information that could enrich the decision, such as performance
   metrics).  In this respect, the information exposed by ALTO in
   reference to the requesting end-user can be consumed by CDN control
   elements for improving the decision on what delivery point to select
   [RFC7971].

   Further than that, additional scenarios can benefit from ALTO network
   information exposure capabilities.  For instance, in scenarios of
   interconnection of CDNs, such as the one described in
   [I-D.ryan-cdni-capacity-insights-extensions] for advertising capacity
   associated with the CDN internal to an operator, could leverage on
   ALTO capabilities for that purpose (with the necessary
   augmentations).

5.  ALTO as IETF Network Exposure Function

   From its inception, ALTO was defined as a way of informing
   applications about network-related aspects for improving the overall
   service.

   The applications under scope can be either internal or external to
   the operator of the network.  The implications can differ in the
   level of aggregating, abstracting and securely exposing the
   information, but the purpose keeps being the same.
