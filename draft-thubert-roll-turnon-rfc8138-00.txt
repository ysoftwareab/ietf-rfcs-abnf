                   Configuration option for RFC 8138
                  draft-thubert-roll-turnon-rfc8138-00

Abstract

   This document complements RFC 8138 and dedicates a bit in the RPL
   configuration option to indicate whether RFC 8138 compression should
   be used within the RPL instance.  When the bit is not set, source
   nodes that support RFC 8138 should refrain from using the compression
   unless the information is superseded by configuration.

1.  Introduction

   The transition to [RFC8138] in a network can only be done when all
   nodes support the specification.  In a mixed case with both
   RFC8138-capable and non-capable nodes, the compression should be
   turned off.

   This document complements RFC 8138 and dedicates a bit in the RPL
   configuration option to indicate whether RFC 8138 compression should
   be used within the RPL instance.  When the bit is not set, source
   nodes that support RFC 8138 should refrain from using the compression
   unless the information is superseded by configuration.

2.  BCP 14

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Updating RFC 6550

   RPL defines a configuration option that is registered to IANA in
   section 20.14. of [RFC6550].  This specification defines a new flag
   "Enable RFC8138 Compression" (T) that is encoded in one of the
   reserved control bits in the option.  The new flag is set to turn on
   the use of the compression of RPL artifacts with RFC 8138.

4.  Operation

   A node that supports this specification SHOULD source packets in the
   compressed form using [RFC8138] if the new T flag is set in the RPL
   configuration option from its parents.  Failure to do so will result
   in larger packets, yields higher risks of loss and may cause a
   fragmentation.

   A node that supports this specification SHOULD refrain from sourcing
   packets in the compressed form using [RFC8138] if the T flag is
   reset.  This behaviour can be overridden by a configuration of the
   node in order to cope with intermediate implementations of the root
   that support [RFC8138] but not this specification and cannot set the
   T flag.

   Regardless of the setting of the bit, the node MUST forward a packet
   in the form it was received, compressed or uncompressed.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This specification updates the "Registry for the DODAG Configuration
   Option Flags" that was created for [RFC6550] as follows:

     +---------------+---------------------------------+-------------+
     |   Bit number  |         Suggested value         |  Defined in |
     +---------------+---------------------------------+-------------+
     | 2 (suggested) | Turn on RFC8138 Compression (T) |   This RFC  |
     +---------------+---------------------------------+-------------+

               Table 1: New DODAG Configuration Option Flag

6.  Security Considerations

   No specific threat was identified with this specification.
