1. Introduction

   The Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks (ACTN)
   defines an SDN-based architecture that relies on the concepts of
   network and service abstraction to detach network and service
   control from the underlying data plane.

   This document outlines the overview of ACTN capability and the
   applicability of ACTN to Enhanced VPN. In particular, this document
   also discusses how ACTN features can fulfill some of the key
   requirements of the enhanced VPN, which is also known as VPN+
   [VPN+].


2. ACTN Overview

   The framework for ACTN [actn-framework] includes a reference
   architecture that has been adapted for Figure 1 in this document, it
   describes the functional entities and methods for the coordination
   of resources across multiple domains, to provide end-to-end
   services, components include:

     o Customer Network Controller (CNC);

     o Multi-domain Service Coordinator (MDSC);

     o Provisioning Network Controller (PNC).

                            Figure 1: ACTN Hierarchy
   ACTN facilitates end-to-end connections and provides them to the
   user. The ACTN framework highlights how:

     o Abstraction of the underlying network resources are provided to
        higher-layer applications and customers;

     o Virtualization of underlying resources, whose selection
        criterion is the allocation of those resources for the
        customer, application, or service;

     o Creation of a virtualized environment allowing operators to
        view and control multi-domain networks as a single virtualized
        network;

     o The presentation to customers of networks as a virtual network
        via open and programmable interfaces.

   The ACTN managed infrastructure are traffic engineered network
   resources, which may include:

     o Statistical packet bandwidth;

     o Physical forwarding plane sources, such as: wavelengths and
        time slots;

     o Forwarding and cross connect capabilities.

   The ACTN type of network virtualization provides customers and
   applications (tenants) to utilize and independently control
   allocated virtual network resources as if resources as if they were
   physically their own resource.

2.1. ACTN Virtual Network


   To support multiple clients each with its own view of and control of
   the server network, a network operator needs to partition the
   network resources.  The resulting partition can be assigned to each
   client for guaranteed usage which is a step further than shared use

   of common network resources. See [actn-vn] for detailed ACTN VN and
   VNS.


   An ACTN Virtual Network (VN) is a client view of the ACTN managed
   infrastructure, and is presented by the ACTN provider as a set of
   abstracted resources.

   Depending on the agreement between client and provider various VN
   operations and VN views are possible.

      o Virtual Network Creation: A VN could be pre-configured and
        created via static or dynamic request and negotiation between
        customer and provider. It must meet the specified SLA
        attributes which satisfy the customer's objectives.

      o Virtual Network Operations: The virtual network may be further
        modified and deleted based on customer request to request
        changes in the network resources reserved for the customer, and
        used to construct the network slice. The customer can further
        act upon the virtual network to manage traffic flow across the
        virtual network.

      o Virtual Network View: The VN topology from a customer point of
        view. These may be a variety of tunnels, or an entire VN
        topology. Such connections may comprise of customer end points,
        access links, intra domain paths and inter-domain links.

   Dynamic VN Operations allow a customer to modify or delete the VN.
   The customer can further act upon the virtual network to
   create/modify/delete virtual links and nodes.  These changes will
   result in subsequent tunnel management in the operator's networks.

   Primitives (capabilities and messages) have been provided to support
   the different ACTN network control functions that will enable
   virtual network. These include: topology request/query, VN service
   request, path computation and connection control, VN service policy
   negotiation, enforcement, routing options. [actn-info]


2.2. Examples of ACTN Delivering Types of Virtual Networks


   In examples below the ACTN framework is used to provide control,
   management and orchestration for the virtual network life-cycle, and
   the connectivity. These dynamic and highly flexible, end-to-end and

   dedicated virtual network utilizing common physical infrastructure,
   and according to vertical-specific requirements.

   The rest of this section provides three examples of using ACTN to
   achieve different scenarios of ACTN for virtual network. All three
   scenarios can be scaled up in capacity or be subject to topology
   changes as well as changes from customer requirements perspective.


2.2.1. ACTN Used for Virtual Private Line Model


   ACTN provides virtual connections between multiple customer
   locations, requested via Virtual Private Line (VPL) requester (CNC-
   A). Benefits of this model include:

      o Automated: the service set-up and operation is network provider
        managed;

      o Virtual: the private line is seamlessly extended from customers
        Site A (vCE1 to vCE3) and Site B (vCE2 to vCE3) across the
        ACTN-managed WAN to Site C;

      o Agile: on-demand where the customer needs connectivity and
        fully adjustable bandwidth.

2.2.2. ACTN Used for VPN Delivery Model


   ACTN provides VPN connections between multiple sites, requested Via
   a VPN requestor (CNC-A), which is managed by the customer
   themselves. The CNC will then interact with the network provider's
   MDSC. Benefits of this model include:

      o Provides edge-to-edge VPN multi-access connection;

      o Mostly network provider managed, with some flexibility
        delegated to the customer managed CNC.

2.2.3. ACTN Used to Deliver a Virtual Customer Network


   In this example ACTN provides a virtual network resource to the
   customer. This resource is customer managed. Empowering the tenant
   to control allocated VN (recursively). Benefits of this model
   include:

      o The MDSC provides the topology as part of the customer view so
        that the customer can control their network slice to fit their
        needs;

      o Resource isolation, each customer network slice is fixed and
        will not be affected by changes to other customer network
        slices;

      o Applications can interact with their assigned network slice
        directly, the customer may implement their own network control
        method and traffic prioritization, manage their own addressing
        scheme, and further slice their assigned network resource;

      o The network slice may also include specific capability nodes,
        delivered as Physical Network Functions (PNFs) or Virtual
        Network Functions (VNFs).

2.3. Service Mapping from TE to ACTN VN Models


   The role of TE-service mapping model [te-service-mapping] is to
   create a binding relationship across a Layer-3 Service Model [L3sm],
   Layer-2 Service Model [L2SM], Layer-1 Service Model [L1CSM], and TE
   Tunnel model [TE-tunnel], via a generic ACTN Virtual Network (VN)
   model [actn-vn].

   The ACTN VN YANG model [actn-vn] is a generic virtual network
   service model that allows customers (internal or external) to create
   a VN that meets the customer's service objective with various
   constraints.

   The TE-service mapping model [te-service-map] is needed to bind
   L1/2/3 VPN specific service requirements and policies pertaining to
   TE-specific parameters. For example, the model can express the

   isolation requirement for each VPN service instance. Some VPN
   service would require a strict hard isolation with deterministic
   characteristic. In such case the underlay TE networks has to find
   end-to-end tunnels/LSPs that satisfy this particular isolation
   requirement.

   This binding will facilitate a seamless service operation with
   underlay-TE network visibility. The TE-service model developed in
   this document can also be extended to support other services
   including L2SM, and L1CSM.


2.4. ACTN VN KPI telemetry Models


   The role of ACTN VN KPI telemetry model [actn-pm-telemetry] is to
   provide YANG models so that customer can define key performance
   monitoring data relevant for its VN via the YANG subscription model.

   Key characteristics of [actn-pm-telemetry] include:

      o an ability to provide scalable VN-level telemetry aggregation
        based on customer-subscription model for key performance
        parameters defined by the customer;

      o an ability to facilitate proactive re-optimization and
        reconfiguration of VNs based on network
        autonomic traffic engineering scaling configuration
        mechanism.

3. Enhanced VPN and ACTN

   This section discusses how the advanced features of ACTN discussed
   in Section 3 can fulfill the enhanced VPN requirements defined in
   [vpn+]. Key requirements of the enhanced VPN include:


     1. Isolation between VPNs
     2. Guaranteed Performance
     3. Integration
     4. Dynamic Configuration
     5. Customized Control Plane

   Simple creation, deletion and modification of the services.
   Control over VPN Seamless integration of both physical and virtual
   network and service functions

Internet-Draft        ACTN Applicability to VPN+               May 2018


   In the subsequent sections, we discuss how each requirement can be
   fulfilled by the ACTN features and the gaps that remain to be solved
   if applicable.

3.1. Isolation between VPNs


   The ACTN VN YANG model [actn-vn] and the TE-service mapping model
   [te-service-mapping] fulfill the isolation requirement by providing
   the features.

       o Each VN is identified with a unique identifier (vn-id and vn-
          name) and so is each VN member that belongs to the VN (vn-
          member-id).

       o Each instantiated VN is managed and controlled independent of
          other VNs in the network with proper protection level
          (protection)

       o Each VN is instantiated with proper isolation requirement
          mapping introduced by the TE-service mapping model [te-
          service-mapping]. This mapping can support:

            o hard isolation with deterministic characteristics (e.g.,
               this case may need optical bypass tunnel to guarantee
               latency with no jitter);
            o hard isolation (i.e., dedicated TE resources in all
               layers (e.g., packet and optical));
            o soft isolation (i.e., optical layer may be shared while
               packet layer is dedicated);
            o no isolation (i.e., sharing with other VN).



3.2. Guaranteed Performance


   Performance objectives of a VN need first to be expressed in order
   to assure the performance guarantee. [actn-vn] and [te-topo] allow
   configuration of several parameters that may affect the VN
   performance objectives. Among the performance-related parameters per
   a VN level provided by [actn-vn] and [te-topo] are as follows:


     o Bandwidth
     o Objective function (e.g., min cost path, min load path, etc.)



King, et al.              Expires May 12, 2018                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft        ACTN Applicability to VPN+               May 2018


     o Metric Types and their threshold:
       o TE cost, IGP cost, Hop count, or Unidirectional Delay (e.g.,
          can set all path delay <= threshold)


   See the below actn-vn tree structure for the pointer for the
   connectivity matrix identifier for each vn member in which the
   configuration parameters listed above is provisioned using [te-topo]
   model together with [te-tunnel] model in the network.

   Once these requests are instantiated, the resources are committed
   and guaranteed through the life cycle of the VN.

   [actn-pm-telemetry] provides models that allow for key performance
   telemetry configuration mechanisms per VN level, VN member level as
   well as path/link level.

   The following tree structure from [actn-pm-telemetry] illustrates
   how performance data (e.g., delay, delay-variation, utilization,
   etc.) can be subscribed per VN need and monitored via YANG push
   streaming mechanism.

3.3. Integration

   ACTN provides mechanisms to correlate customer's VN and the actual
   TE tunnels instantiated in the provider's network. Specifically,

     o Link each VN member to actual TE tunnel
     o Each VN can be monitored on a various level such as VN level, VN
       member level, TE-tunnel level, and link/node level.

   Service function integration with network topology (L3 and TE
   topology) is in progress in [sf-topology]. Specifically, [sf-
   topology] addresses a number of use-cases that how TE topology
   supports various service functions.

3.4. Dynamic Configuration

   ACTN provides an architecture that allows the customer network
   controller (CNC) interacts with the MDSC which is network provider's

   SDN controller in such a way that customer is given the control of
   their VNs.

   Specifically, the ACTN VN model [actn-vn] allows the following
   capabilities:


     o Dynamic control over VN the customer creates.
          o Create, Modify, Delete

   See the following tree structure from [actn-vn] as an example for
   the dynamic configuration capability (write) VN creation, modify and
   delete. VN can be dynamically created/modified/deleted with
   constraints such as metric types (e.g., delay), bandwidth,
   protection, etc.

3.5. Customized Control Plane


   ACTN provides a YANG model that allows the customer network
   controller (CNC) to control VN via type 2 operation. Type 2 VN



King, et al.              Expires May 12, 2018                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft        ACTN Applicability to VPN+               May 2018


   allows the customer to provision pertinent LSPs that connect their
   endpoints over the customized VN topology dynamically.

   See the following tree structure from [actn-vn] as an example for
   the provisioning of LSPs over the VN topology via TE-topology's [TE-
   Topo] Connectivity Matrix's construct.

   For some VN members of a VN, the customers are allowed to configure
   the actual path (i.e., detailed virtual nodes and virtual links)
   over the VN/abstract topology agreed mutually between CNC and MDSC
   prior to or a topology created by the MDSC as part of VN
   instantiation. Type 2 VN is always built on top of a Type 1 VN. If a
   Type 2 VN is desired for some or all of VN members of a type 1 VN
   (see the example in Section 2.1 of [ACTN-VN]), the TE-topology model
   can provide the following abstract topology (that consists of
   virtual nodes and virtual links) which is built on top of the Type 1
   VN so that customers can configure path over this topology.

3.6. The Gaps

   ACTN allows the customers/users to subscribe and monitor VN/Tunnel
   level performance data such as latency. The low level latency and
   isolation characteristics that are sought by some VPN+ users such as



King, et al.              Expires May 12, 2018                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft        ACTN Applicability to VPN+               May 2018


   steering packets through specific queues resources are not in the
   scope of ACTN.

   This implies that the device-level performance data such as queuing
   delay caused by various queuing mechanisms needs to be characterized
   and monitored by a device level YANG PM model. Then the Domain SDN
   controller (PNC) will need to estimate Domain LSP level PM data from
   device-level PM data. Finally, the MDSC will need to derive
   VN/Tunnel level PM data and present to the customers.

   Another gap that needs to be filled up is how to coordinate non-TE
   element from the routing and signaling standpoints. Currently, ACTN
   is limited to TE elements. From an end-to-end network standpoint,
   the scope of VPN+ may encompass non-TE elements in some
   segments/domains as well as TE elements. How to seamlessly provide
   end-to-end tunnel management and the operations of abstraction of
   resources across non-TE and TE elements of the network will need to
   be worked out further.

4. Security Considerations

   Virtual network instantiation involves the control of network
   resources in order to meet the service requirements of consumers.
   In some deployment models, the consumer is able to directly request
   modification in the behaviour of resources owned and operated by a
   service provider. Such changes could significantly affect the
   service provider's ability to provide services to other consumers.
   Furthermore, the resources allocated for or consumed by a consumer
   will normally be billable by the service provider.

   Therefore, it is crucial that the mechanisms used in any virtual
   network system allow for authentication of requests, security of
   those requests, and tracking of resource allocations.

   It should also be noted that while the partitioning of resources is
   virtual, the consumers expect and require that there is no risk of
   leakage of data from one slice to another, no transfer of knowledge
   of the structure or even existence of other virtual networks, and
   that changes to one virtual network (under the control of one
   consumer) should not have detrimental effects on the operation of
   other virtual networks (whether under control of different or the
   same consumers) beyond the limits allowed within the SLA.  Thus,
   virtual networks are assumed to be private and to provide the
   appearance of genuine physical connectivity.

   ACTN operates using the [netconf] or [restconf] protocols and

   assumes the security characteristics of those protocols.  Deployment
   models for ACTN should fully explore the authentication and other
   security aspects before networks start to carry live traffic.
