1.  Introduction

   In the Atom Syndication Format [RFC4287], the order of entries as
   presented in a feed is typically considered to be insignificant.
   This presents a challenge when the list of entries is intended to
   represent an ordered or ranked set.  This document specifies an
   extension that allows feed publishers to establish numeric rankings
   for entries within a feed to be used as a means of organizing and
   sorting those entries.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].

   This specification uses XML Namespaces [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114]
   to uniquely identify XML element names.  It uses the following
   namespace prefix for the indicated namespace URI;
   "r": "http://purl.org/syndication/index/1.0"

   This specification uses terms from the XML Infoset [W3C.REC-xml-
   infoset-20040204].  However, this specification uses a shorthand; the
   phrase "Information Item" is omitted when naming Element Information
   Items.  Therefore, when this specification uses the term "element,"
   it is referring to an Element Information Item in Infoset terms.


3.  Ranking Domains and Schemes

   A 'Ranking Domain' is a uniquely identifiable logical collection of
   entries containing numeric ranking values.

   'Ranking Schemes' identify the specific rules for how the numeric
   ranking values within a 'Ranking Domain' are to be interpreted.

3.1.  The 'r:scheme' element

   Ranking Schemes are defined using the r:scheme element.











Snell                   Expires October 12, 2006                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                  Atom Rank                     April 2006


     rankingScheme = element r:scheme {
       atomCommonAttributes,
       attribute name { IRI }?,
       attribute label { text }?,
       attribute significance { 'ascending' | 'descending' }?,
       attribute precision { nonNegativeInteger }?,
       attribute step { decimal }?,
       attribute minimum { decimal }?,
       attribute maximum { decimal }?
     }

   o  The 'name' attribute provides a universally unique identifier for
      the scheme in the form of an absolute IRI.
   o  The 'label' attribute specifies a Language-Sensitive, human
      readable label for the scheme.
   o  The 'significance' attribute indicates how implementations are to
      interpret the significance of an entries numeric ranking value.  A
      value of 'descending' indicates that the significance of the rank
      descends as the numeric ranking value increases.  A value of
      'ascending' indicates that the significance of the rank increases
      as the numeric ranking value increases.  If not specified, the
      significance is considered to be 'ascending'.
   o  The 'precision' attribute specifies the total number of decimal
      digits allowed in the value of the numeric ranking value.  The
      value is expressed as a non-negative integer.  If not specified
      the value is considered to be indeterminate (e.g., the number 2.0
      is not distinct from the number 2.00).  Ranking schemes that are
      based on fractional numeric ranking values SHOULD specify a
      precision.
   o  The 'step' attribute specifies the minimum significant increment
      for numeric ranking values.  For instance, if a scheme is based on
      full and half values (e.g. 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, etc), the step
      attribute value would be 0.5.  If not specified, no significant
      increment is considered to apply.  Numeric ranking values that do
      not precisely match the pattern specified by the step attribute
      MUST be rounded down to the nearest significant increment (e.g.,
      in the half step example given above, the value 0.85 is equivalent
      to the value 0.5).
   o  The 'minumum' attribute specifies the lowest possible numeric
      ranking value (inclusive).  If not specified, the minimum value is
      considered to be 0.
   o  The 'maximum' attribute specifies the highest possible numeric
      ranking value (inclusive).  If not specified, no maximum value is
      considered to apply.

   An Atom feed element MAY contain any number of r:scheme elements.  A
   Feed MUST NOT contain more than one r:scheme element with the same
   name.

     <feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
           xmlns:r="http://purl.org/syndication/index/1.0">
       ...
       <r:scheme
         name="tag:example.org,2006:movie_reviews"
         xml:lang="en-us"
         label="Five Star Reviews"
         precision="0"
         step="1"
         significance="ascending"
         minimum="0"
         maximum="5" />
       ...
     </feed>

3.2.  The 'r:rank' element

   Entries within a feed MAY contain zero or more r:rank elements
   specifing a numeric ranking value within a given Ranking Domain.  An
   entry MUST NOT contain more than one r:rank element with the same
   combination of domain and scheme attribute values.

    rankingValue = element r:rank {
       atomCommonAttributes,
       attribute domain {IRI}?,
       attribute scheme {IRI}?,
       attribute label { text }?,
       { decimal }
     }

   The 'domain' attribute identifies the Ranking Domain.  See "Ranking
   Domain Scope" for details.

   The 'scheme' attribute identifies the Ranking Scheme.  If not
   specified, the scheme is assumed to be the Default Ranking Scheme.

   The 'label' attribute provides a Language-Sensitive, human readable
   label for the ranking value.

   The value of the r:rank is a decimal value conforming to the XML
   Schema decimal data type [W3C.REC-xmlschema-2-20041028].  The value
   MUST NOT contain any leading or trailing whitespace.

     <r:rank
       domain="http://example.org/movie_reviews"
       scheme="tag:example.com,2006:movie_reviews"
       label="Good">3.5</r:rank>

4.  Ranking Domain Scope

   Ranking Domain's provide a logical mechanism used to associate a
   numerically ranked set of resources.  Ranking Domains are identified
   by absolute or relative IRI's.

   Ranking Domains fall into one of three scopes:
   o  Feed Scope (known as the "Feed Ranking Domain")
   o  Document Scope (known as the "Document Ranking Domain")
   o  Domain Scope

   Numeric ranking values that do not specify a domain attribute are
   associated with the Feed Ranking Domain.  The IRI identity of the
   Feed Ranking Domain is the same as the containing feed element's
   atom:id element.

   A numeric ranking associated with the Feed Ranking Domain

     <r:rank
       scheme="tag:example.org,2006:movie_reviews"
       label="Good" >3.5</r:rank>

   The set of entries contained within the Feed Ranking Domain is
   limited to the set of entries contained within the feed.

   Numeric rankings that specify a domain equal or equivalent to the in-
   scope Base URI are associated with a Document Ranking Domain
   identified by the in-scope Base URI.

   A numeric ranking associated with the Document Ranking Domain

     <r:rank
       domain=""
       scheme="tag:example.org,2006:movie_reviews"
       label="Good">3.5</r:rank>

   The set of entries contained within the Document Ranking Domain is
   limited to the set of entries contained within the Document
   identified by the Base URI.

   Numeric ranking values that specify any IRI value other than the Base
   URI of the containing document and the atom:id of the containing feed
   are associated with a Domain Scope.

   A numeric ranking associated with the Feed Ranking Domain

     <r:rank
       domain="http://www.example.org/movie_reviews"
       scheme="tag:example.org,2006:movie_reviews"
       label="Good">3.5</r:rank>

   Domain Scoped SHOULD be considered to be open sets consistings of
   entries from any number of feeds.

4.1.  The Document Ranking Domain and xml:base

   When specifying or processing rankings in the Document Ranking
   Domain, implementors need to be aware of the possible sides effect of
   using the xml:base attribute.

   For instance, in the example,

     <feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
           xml:base="http://example.org/feed.xml" ...>
       ...
       <entry>
         <id>tag:example.org,2005:1</id>
         <r:rank
           domain=""
           scheme="tag:example.org,2006:movie_reviews"
           label="Good">3.5</r:rank>
         ...
       </enry>
       <entry xml:base="http://example.com/anotherfeed.xml">
         <id>tag:example.com,2005:1</id>
         <r:rank
           domain=""
           scheme="tag:example.org,2006:movie_reviews"
           label="Good">3.5</r:rank>
         ...
       </enry>
       <entry>
         <id>tag:example.com,2005:2</id>
         <r:rank
           domain="http://example.org/anotherfeed.xml"
           scheme="tag:example.org,2006:movie_reviews"
           label="Good">3.5</r:rank>
         ...
       </enry>
     </feed>

   The three entries contained by the feed exist in two separate

Internet-Draft                  Atom Rank                     April 2006


   Document Ranking Domains, each respectively identified by the URI's
   "http://example.org/feed.xml" and
   "http://example.com/anotherfeed.xml".

   It is posible for the set of entries within a Document Ranking Domain
   to span multiple Atom Feed Documents if those documents share the
   same Base URI as specified by mechanisms such as xml:base or the
   Content-Location HTTP header.


5.  Ranking Domain and Scheme Identifiers

   The IRI's identifying Ranking Domains and Ranking Schemes are subject
   to the same construction and comparison rules as the atom:id element.

   Comparison's of domain and scheme identifiers MUST be performed on a
   case-sensitive, character-by-character basis solely on the IRI
   character strings and MUST NOT rely on dereferencing the IRI's or
   URI's mapped from them.


6.  Processing Rankings

   Processing a Ranking Domain involves the following steps:
      Select the Ranking Scheme.
      Identify the Ranking Domain
      Identify the available set of entries containing numeric ranking
      values within the identified Ranking Domain using the selected
      Ranking Scheme.
      Remove from the set all entries whose rankings fall outside the
      minimum and maximum values set by the selected Ranking Scheme.
      Sort the remaining set of ranked entries according to the
      significance and precision of the numeric ranking as specified by
      the Ranking Scheme.


7.  Default Ranking Scheme

   Feeds MAY contain ranked entries that have no specified scheme.  In
   such cases the Default Ranking Scheme should be applied.

   o  label = 'Default Ranking'
   o  significance = 'ascending'
   o  precision = unspecified
   o  step = unspecified
   o  minimum = 0

Internet-Draft                  Atom Rank                     April 2006


   o  maximum = unspecified


8.  Well-Known Ranking Schemes

   Feeds MAY contain ranked entries whose ranking scheme cannot be
   resolved (i.e., no r:scheme with a 'name' attribute matching the
   rankings "scheme" attribute can be found).  In such cases software
   implementations MAY attempt to match such rankings to well-known
   schemes.  For instance, an online search engine may choose to define
   a ranking scheme that is reflective of the relevance of a given
   result to a search query; rather than require that a r:scheme element
   be included in every feed where the Ranking Scheme may be used, the
   search engine may separately publish its Ranking Scheme and
   associated Ranking Domain.  (The format of such a publication is
   beyond the scope of this specification.)

   A hypothetical search engine ranking using a well-known scheme

     <r:rank scheme="http://search.example.org/relevance">5</r:rank>

   If a Ranking Scheme cannot be resolved this way (e.g., no r:scheme
   with a matching 'name' attribute can be found and the scheme is not
   well-known), the Default Ranking Scheme should be applied.

   Further, it is possible that a processor may resolve multiple Ranking
   Schemes for a given Ranking.  In such cases, the processor may decide
   which Scheme to apply.


9.  Security Considerations

   Because this specification defines an extension to the Atom
   Syndication Format [RFC4287], it is subject to the same security
   consideration as defined in section 8 of that specification.


10.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations introduced by this specification.
