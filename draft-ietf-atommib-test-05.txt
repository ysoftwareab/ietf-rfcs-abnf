          2.  Abstract

          This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
          (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the
          Internet community.  In particular, it describes objects used
          for managing ATM-based interfaces, devices, networks and
          services in addition to those defined in the ATM MIB [16], to
          provide support for the management of on-demand ATM Loopback
          Tests.


          3.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

          The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
          components:

          0    An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [1].

          0    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events
               for the purpose of management.  The first version of this
               Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1
               and described in RFC 1155 [2], RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215
               [4].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described in
               RFC 1902 [5], RFC 1903 [6] and RFC 1904 [7].

          0    Message protocols for transferring management
               information.  The first version of the SNMP message
               protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in RFC 1157 [8].
               A second version of the SNMP message protocol, which is
               not an Internet standards track protocol, is called
               SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
               The third version of the message protocol is called
               SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11] and
               RFC 2274 [12].

          0    Protocol operations for accessing management information.
               The first set of protocol operations and associated PDU
               formats is described in RFC 1157 [8].  A second set of
               protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
               described in RFC 1905 [13].

          Internet-Draft         ATM Test Objects          April 7, 1999


          0    A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273
               [14] and the view-based access control mechanism
               described in RFC 2275 [15].

          Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
          termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
          MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

          This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the
          SMIv2.  A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through
          the appropriate translations.  The resulting translated MIB
          must be semantically equivalent, except where objects or
          events are omitted because no translation is possible (e.g.,
          use of Counter64).  Some machine readable information in SMIv2
          will be converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during
          the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
          readable information is not considered to change the semantics
          of the MIB.

          Internet-Draft         ATM Test Objects          April 7, 1999


          4.  Overview

          The purpose of this memo is to provide additional
          capabilities, not found in the ATM MIB [16], which are needed
          to manage ATM interfaces.  This memo addresses ATM Testing
          Support and must be used in conjunction with the
          System/Interface Test MIB [22].


          4.1.  Background

          In addition to the MIB module defined in this memo, other MIB
          modules are necessary to manage ATM interfaces, links and
          cross-connects.  Examples include MIB II for general system
          [17] and interface management [18], the DS3 or SONET/SDH MIBs
          for management of SONET/SDH and DS3 physical interfaces, and,
          as appropriate, MIB modules for applications that make use of
          ATM, such as SMDS and LAN Emulation.  These MIB modules are
          outside the scope of this specification.

          This MIB module requires the use of the ATM MIB module defined
          in [16] and the System/Interface Test MIB module [22].

          This memo defines extensions to the ATM MIB in order to
          support ATM Loopback Tests. An ATM Loopback Test provides the
          ability to send out a loopback OAM (Operations and
          Maintenance) cell to verify the existence of connectivity for
          a particular connection.

          4.2.  Terminology

          The following terms are defined here and used throughout this
          MIB:
               - Virtual Path Link (VPL)
               - Virtual Path Connection (VPC)
               - Virtual Path Segment (VP Segment)
               - Virtual Channel Link (VCL)
               - Virtual Channel Connection (VCC)
               - Virtual Channel Segment (VC Segment).

          4.3.  Supported Functions

          The managed ATM objects are organized as follows:

                (1) ATM Loopback Testing
                (2) ATM End-Point Tables

          4.3.1.  ATM Loopback Testing

          The loopback test provides the ability to send out a loopback
          OAM cell to verify the existence of connectivity for a
          particular connection.  Loopback tests can be performed on
          either an entire connection (i.e., an end-to-end test), a
          segment of the connection (i.e., a segment test), a portion of
          a segment (i.e., a loopback location identifier test), or the
          network portion of a connection (i.e., a service internal
          test).

          The loopback test makes use of the Test Table defined in [22].
          For a given interface, a loopback test can be invoked by
          obtaining ownership of a test and then by setting the value of
          testType equal to one of the ATM Loopback Test Types defined
          in Section 5. See procedures in [22] for using the Test Table.

          Internet-Draft         ATM Test Objects          April 7, 1999


          After invoking a loopback test, the object testResult can be
          read to determine the outcome of the loopback test (e.g.,
          'success(2)' if the loopback cell made it back to the
          originator of the test or 'failed(7)' if the loopback cell did
          not make it back).

          The following types of loopback tests are defined:

               - End-to-end Loopback Test
               - Segment Loopback Test
               - Loopback Test Using Loopback Location Identifier
               - Network Loopback Test.


          1) End-to-end Loopback Test

          The end-to-end loopback (LB) is self-explanatory.  For a VP
          test, the cell is sent on the given VP, via VCI=4 specified in
          [20].  For a VC test, the LB cell is sent on the VC under
          test, with the PTI (Payload Type Indicator) set to 5 as
          specified in [20].  Figure 3 illustrates the end-to-end
          loopback test.

          See Section 5 for more details on how to use the End-to-end
          Loopback Test.


          2) Segment Loopback Test

          The segment LB test is explained in ITU-T I.610[21]. For a VP
          segment test, the LB cell is sent on the VP under test via
          VCI=3 as specified in [20], and the Loopback Location ID field
          is set to all 1's.  For a VC segment test, the LB cell is sent
          on the VC under test, with the PTI set to 4 as specified in





          Expires October 7, 1999                               [Page 7]





          Internet-Draft         ATM Test Objects          April 7, 1999


          [20], and the Loopback Location ID field is set to all 1's.

          This test involves a LB cell being inserted at a pre-defined
          segment end-point, and looped back at the corresponding
          segment end-point encountered.  The pair of segment end-points
          define a segment (which is used for the segment loopback
          test).  A VP/VC connection can have multiple segments, but
          multiple segments cannot overlap.

          A UNI interface is by definition defined as a segment end-
          point (hence a UNI would be considered a segment).  A segment
          can also define:
               - a B-ICI
               - a public carrier's 'piece' of the connection
               - a private network's 'piece' of the connection.


          In order to support this functionality, the VP/VC link
          termination needs to be able to be defined as a segment.  This
          can be done using either the atmVplSegmentEndPoint or
          atmVclSegmentEndPoint object depending on whether it is for a
          VPC or VCC.  A segment loopback test is illustrated in Figure
          4.

          3) Loopback Test Using Loopback Location Identifier

          This loopback test is a special type of 2) where the Loopback
          Location ID field is set to a value that corresponds to a
          specific node in a given network (Note that the format of this
          field is not standardized, that is, the value is significant
          only within an administrative domain).  In this case, the
          device initiating the LB test inserts the appropriate Loop
          Back Location ID.  When the LB cell reaches the corresponding

          device, that device recognizes the Loopback Location ID as its
          own, and loops it back.  This test is useful for performing
          fault sectionalization without having to provision segment
          end-points.  An additional object, the atmLoopbackID, is
          defined to determine the loopback point.  Figure 5 shows a
          loopback test using a location identifier. Note that the
          loopback test using location identifier can be used to perform
          a loopback test over a portion of a defined segment.  See
          Figure 5.

          4) Network Loopback Test

          This is a loopback test that the manager requests an agent in
          a network to perform over the internal portion of a designated
          connection.  The Network then initiates the internal network
          loopback test by inserting an OAM loopback cell at one of the
          end-points of the internal network portion of the connection.
          When the loopback cell reaches the other end-point of the
          internal Network , the cell is looped back.  This test is
          useful for verifying connectivity through a particular
          network.  Figure 6 illustrates the Network loopback test.

          4.3.2.  ATM End-Point Tables

          There are two ATM End-point tables: the ATM VP End-point Table
          and the ATM VC End-point Table. The ATM VP End-point Table
          augments the atmVplTable and defines the
          atmVplEndptSegmentEndPoint object to represent whether or not

                   DESCRIPTION
                     "This is an end-to-end loopback test performed on a
                     designated VP (Virtual Path).  To perform this test
                     an end-to-end loopback OAM cell is inserted at one
                     of the end-points of the designated VP connection
                     (e.g., at a host) via VCI=4 (the VCI value for VP
                     OAM end-to-end cells), travels to the other end-
                     point of the VP connection, and then loops back to
                     the originating end-point on the designated VP.
                     Success is achieved if the loopback OAM cell
                     returns to the originating end-point within 5
                     seconds, otherwise, the test fails.

                     The manager-station performs a loopback test by
                     making use of the testTable defined in [22].  In
                     order to run this test the object testType in the
                     testTable shall be set to atmLoopbackVpE2e, and the
                     object testTarget points to the row in the
                     atmVplTable in [16] corresponding to the VP
                     designated for the test.

                     Before starting a test, a manager-station must
                     first obtain 'ownership' of the entry in the
                     testTable for the interface to be tested (follow
                     procedure defined in [22]).  Once the manager-
                     station obtains ownership, a loopback test for a
                     given interface can be invoked by first setting up
                     parameters necessary for the loopback test (e.g.,
                     set the testTarget), and then setting the value of
                     testType in the testTable equal to
                     'atmLoopbackVpE2e'. The testRowStatus is used to
                     invoke the atmLoopbackVpE2e test on the VP with the
                     VPI corresponding to the testTarget.

                     After invoking a loopback test, wait for the test
                     completion by polling for the object testResult.  A
                     value of 'inProgress(3)' will result if the test is
                     still in progress.  Once the test is completed, the
                     object testResult will have a value of 'success(2)'

                   segment end-point, and then loops back to the

                   In order to use the atmLoopbackVpSegment test, a

                  VC. Success is achieved if the loopback OAM cell
                  returns to the originating end-point within 5 seconds,
                  otherwise, the test fails.

                  In order to use the atmLoopbackVcSegment test, a
                  segment must be defined by setting up segment end-
                  points using the atmVclEndptSegmentEndPoint object
                  from the atmVclEndptTable.  The
                  atmVclEndptSegmentEndPoint is set to
                  'isaVcSegmentEndPoint(1)' for each segment end-point.
                  Note that this object is by default set to
                  'isaVcSegmentEndPoint(1)' if the atmVclTable supports
                  one end of a UNI.  In such a case, a UNI VC loopback
                  test would be achieved when the atmLoopbackVcSegment
                  test was initiated over the UNI.

                  The manager-station performs a loopback test by making
                  use of the testTable defined in [22].  In order to run
                  this test the object testType in the testTable shall
                  be set to atmLoopbackVcE2e, and the object testTarget
                  points to the row in the atmVclTable in [16]
                  corresponding to the VC designated for the test.

                  Before starting a test, a manager-station must first
                  obtain 'ownership' of the entry in the testTable for
                  the interface to be tested (follow procedure defined
                  in [22]).  Once the manager-station obtains ownership,
                  a loopback test for a given interface can be invoked
                  by first setting up parameters necessary for the
                  loopback test (e.g., set the testTarget), and then
                  setting the value of testType in the testTable equal
                  to 'atmLoopbackVcSegment'. The testRowStatus is used
                  to invoke the atmLoopbackVcSegment test on the VC with
                  the VPI/VCI corresponding to the testTarget.

                  After invoking a loopback test, wait for the test
                  completion by polling for the object testResult.  A
                  value of 'inProgress(3)' will result if the test is
                  still in progress.  Once the test is completed, the
                  object testResult will have a value of 'success(2)' if
                  the loopback OAM cell returned to the originator of
                  the test within 5 seconds, if not, a value of
                  'failed(7)' will result.  If the ATM system does not
                  support this type of loopback test, then a value of
                  'notSupported(4)' will be provided.  Other possible

          Internet-Draft         ATM Test Objects          April 7, 1999


          8.  Security Considerations

          There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB
          that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-
          create.  Such objects may be considered sensitive or
          vulnerable in some network environments. The support for SET
          operations in a non-secure environment without proper
          protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

          The managed objects in this MIB contain sensitive information
          since, collectively, they allow the invocation of tests on the
          managed device.

          This MIB contains objects which allow an administrator to
          perform tests on ATM interfaces.  Tests can only be performed
          when using these objects in conjunction with [22].
          Unauthorized access to the associated objects could cause a
          denial of service, or in combination with other (e.g.,
          physical) security breaches, could cause unauthorized
          connectivity to a device. The tests defined in this document
          are not service interrupting.

          It is thus important to control even GET access to these
          objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these
          object when sending them over the network via SNMP. Not all
          versions of SNMP provide features for such a secure
          environment.

          SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the
          network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even
          then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
          allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the
          objects in this MIB.

          It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
          features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically,
          the use of the User-based Security Model RFC 2274 [12] and the
          View-based Access Control Model RFC 2275 [15] is recommended.

          It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the
          SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is
          properly configured to give access to the objects only to
          those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed
          GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

          10.  RFC Editor and IANA Considerations

          Prior to publication of this memo as an RFC, the RFC Editor
          and IANA are requested to make a suitable OBJECT IDENTIFIER
          assignment for this MIB module (the value for XX below) and
          update the following in the MIB:

               ::= { mib-2 XX }

          -- ********  NOTE TO THE RFC EDITOR / IANA ***********
          -- * Before this module is put on the standards track
          -- * assign XX by IANA.
          -- * remove this notice from the MIB

          for the use of such proprietary rights by implementors or
          users of this specification can be obtained from the IETF
          Secretariat.

          The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its
