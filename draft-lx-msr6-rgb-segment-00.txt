1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing ([RFC8402]) leverages the mechanism of source
   routing.  An ingress node steers a packet through an ordered list of
   instructions, called "segments".  Each one of these instructions
   represents a function to be implemented at a specific location in the
   network.  A function is locally defined on the node where it is
   executed.  Network Programming combines Segment Routing functions to
   achieve a networking objective that goes beyond mere packet routing.
   [RFC8986] defines the SRv6 Network Programming concept and specifies
   the main Segment Routing behaviors and network programming functions.

Internet-Draft            RGB Segment for MSR6              October 2021


   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) [RFC8279] is an architecture
   that provides optimal multicast forwarding without requiring a
   protocol for explicitly building multicast distribution trees or per-
   flow state maintained by intermediate routers.  When a multicast data
   packet enters BIER forwarding domain, the ingress node encapsulates
   the packet with a bitstring, each bitposition of which presents the
   egress nodes.  To forward the packet to a given set of egress nodes,
   the bits corresponding to those egress nodes are set in the
   bitstring.  The intermediate nodes in the BIER domain replicate and
   forward the packet based on the bitstring.The mechanism of forwarding
   a packet based on bitstring of BIER are specified in [RFC8279].

   An IPv6 based multicast source routing (MSR6) solution is defined in
   [I-D.cheng-spring-ipv6-msr-design-consideration], which leverages the
   benefits of source routing over IPv6 data plane to provide simplified
   multicast TE and BE service in an IPv6 network without unnecessary
   multicast tree status and complex control plane protocols.  MSR6
   needs to reuse the advantages of SRv6 and BIER to implement source
   routing.

   MSR6 has two basic modes of forwarding: one is based on Shortest Path
   First(SPF), which is called MSR6 BE mode; the other is based on
   traffic engineered, which is called MSR6 TE mode.  This document
   defines a new type of segment, Replication through Global Bitstring
   Segment (RGB Segment), and the packet processing procedures over the
   IPv6 data plane for the MSR6 BE solutions.

2.  Terminologies

   The following new terms are used throughout this document:

   MSR6 Domain: a set of nodes participating in the multicast source
   routing;

   MSR6 Ingress Node: a node through which a multicast data packet
   enters an MSR6 domain; The MSR6 Ingress Node could be a host or a
   network device.

   MSR6 Egress Node: a node through which a multicast data packet leaves
   an MSR6 domain; The MSR6 Egress Node could be a host or a network
   device.

   MSR6 Root Node: a node which is the beginning point of a multicast
   tree.  It encapsulates the packet with an MSR6 multicast header.

   MSR6 Leaf Node: a node which is the ending point of a multicast tree.
   It decapsulates the MSR6 multicast header in the packet.

Internet-Draft            RGB Segment for MSR6              October 2021


   MSR6 Replication Endpoint: the intermediate node of a multicast tree,
   which replicates packet and forwards the packet to the downstream
   nodes.  For MSR6, the Replication Node is called Replication Endpoint
   which can be indicated by the MSR6 Segment and replicate packets
   according to the multicast source routing information encapsulation
   in the MSR6 header of the packet.

   MSR6 Transit Node: a node which forwards the MSR6 packet as an IPv6
   unicast packet;

3.  RGB Destination Options Header

   MSR6 BE needs to indicate egress nodes in the packet to avoid
   maintaining multicast tree state in the intermediate nodes.  Such
   mechanism that has been defined in IETF, as BIER defined in
   [RFC8279], could be reused in MSR6 BE with global bitstring
   indicating egress nodes.

   A new DoH option called RGB option is introduced in this document to
   support MSR6 BE.  The option includes the bistring representing
   egress nodes and MUST be encapsulated in the IPv6 Destination Options
   Header defined in RFC8200.

   The encoding of RGB(Replication through Global Bitstring) Option Data
   is defined as follows:

        0                   1                   2                   3

       ~                      RGB Option Data                         ~
       |                                                               |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Next Header  8-bit selector.  Identifies the type of header
      immediately following the Destination Options header.

   Hdr Ext Len  8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the Destination
      Options header in 8-octet units, not including the first 8 octets.

   Option Type  To be allocated by IANA.  See section 6.

   Option Length  8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the option, in
      octets, excluding the Option Type and Option Length fields.

   RGB Option is defined as follows:

   The RGB Option Data reuses some codepoint of Non-MPLS BIER Header
   defined in [RFC8296] except the fields of Nibble, DSCP and Proto,
   which are replaced as the Reserved field.  The Reserved fields SHOULD
   be set to 0 and MUST be ignored up reception.

4.  RGB Segment


4.1.  RGB Segment Definition

   The segment defined in [RFC8402] can represent instruction,
   topological or service based.  In an IPv6 domain, a segment could be
   encoded as an IPv6 address.

   In the IPv6 data plane, RGB segment is a new type of segment which is
   used to identify the Replication Endpoint.  Replication Endpoint is
   able to replicate the packet using BIER forwarding mechanism
   according to the bitstring defined in the RGB Option.

   RGB segment is used as an IPv6 address, which is 128 bits and follows
   the SID format defined in [RFC8986], consisting of LOC:FUNCT:ARG.
   RGB segment is advertised by the RGB replication endpoint.

   In an MSR6 domain, RGB segment is used as the destination address of
   the MSR BE packet, when a packet is replicated to the next
   Replication Endpoint.  If there is 1 or more MSR6 transit node
   between two Replication Endpoints, the packet is forwarded as normal
   unicast IPv6 packet.

Internet-Draft            RGB Segment for MSR6              October 2021


4.2.  End.RGB Behavior

   In SRv6, a packet processing behavior executed at an SRv6 Segment
   Endpoint Node ([RFC8986]).  In MSR6, a new type of behavior,
   End.RGB(End.  Replication through Global Bitstring), is defined for
   RGB Segment.  The pseudo-code for End.RGB is defined in this section.

   When an MSR6 Replication Endpoint receives a packet whose IPv6 DA
   (Destination Address) is a SID and the SID is a local End.RGB SID,
   the MSR6 Replication Endpoint does the following:

    1. IF (There is DoH as an IPv6 Extension header and one of the options type is RGB)  ;
    2.   Lookup BIFT(Bit Index Forwarding Table, RFC8279) based on the bitstring
           inside the RGB Option Data.
    3.   Forward the packet via the matched entry in the BIFT.
    4. ELSE IF NH=ICMPv6 or (NH=RGB Extension Header Type and NH
        of Extension Header=ICMPv6)  ;
    5.   Send to CPU.
    6. ELSE  ;Ref
    7.   Drop the packet.

   Ref: An ICMPv6 packet using End.RGB as destination address.


5.  MSR6 BE Encapsulation


   The Encapsulation of MSR6 BE packet is defined as follows:

      +---------------+------------------+----------------------+
      |  IPv6 header  |  IPv6 DO Header  |  Client Multicast    |
      |               | with RGB Option |  Packet or Upper     |
      |               |                  |  Layer Encasulations |
      | Next Hdr = 60 |   Nxt Hdr = X    |                      |
      +---------------+------------------+----------------------+
      |                                  |                      |
      |<---------MSR6 BE header--------->|<--MSR6 BE payload--->|

   In the MSR6 BE header, the RGB Segment is used as the IPv6
   Destination Address and it indicates the next MSR6 Replication
   Endpoints in an MSR domain in an MSR6 domain.

   The MSR6 BE header also includes a DOH containing RGB option defined
   in section.  The RGB Replication Endpoint indicated by the RGB
   Segment replicate the packet according to the bitstring information
   in the RGB option.

6.  Packet Processing Procedure

   This section defines the general process of MSR6 to transport a
   multicast service.  The corresponding control plane is out of scope
   of this document and could be discussed in the following work.

   MSR6 Root Node: Encapsulate the packet with MSR BE encapsulation as
   defined in section 5.  The bitstring in the DoH is determined by the
   egress nodes the packet is supposed to be replicated to.  The IPv6
   destination address is the RGB segment which is determined by the
   next MSR6 RGB Replication Endpoints the packet is supposed to be sent
   to.  The downstream MSR6 Replication Endpoints are determined by the
   matched entries in BIFT according to the bier forwarding mechanism.

   MSR6 Replication Endpoint: Replicate the packet and forward it to the
   next MSR6 Replication Endpoints.  When an MSR6 Replication Endpoint
   receives a packet whose IPv6 Destination Address is A and A is the
   local RGB segment for the existing MSR6 Replication Endpoint, process
   the bitstring in the RGB DoH of the packet and look up the
   corresponding BITF for the next MSR6 Replication Endpoints.
   Replicate the packet, update the bitstring and DA in each replicated
   packet based on the lookup result.The RGB processing procedure
   follows the specification in RGB architecture defined in RFC8279.

   MSR6 Transit Node: Transit the packet as an ordinary IPv6 packet by
   looking up FIB until find the next MSR6 Replication Endpoint.

   MSR6 Leaf Node: Decasulate the MSR BE encapsulation.  When an MSR6
   Replication Endpoint receives a packet whose IPv6 Destination Address
   is A and A is the local RGB segment and the one of the bits set to 1
   identifies the MSR6 Replication Endpoint itself, this Replication
   Endpoint is the egress node.  If the MSR6 egress node is the edge of
   a network, copy the packet and send the copy to the multicast flow
   overlay; If the MSR6 egress node is the host supposed to receive the
   packet, send the packet to the upper layer.

{S=Server1,D=P1}: Source address and Destination address in IPv6 header.
[BitStr=0110]: BitString value in IPv6 Destination Options Header.

   Server1 generates the packet with an IPv6 Header.  Knowing that BFR-
   ID of Client 1 is 2 and BFR-ID of Client 2 is 3, it follows that when
   the multicast service is supposed to be transmitted to Client1 and
   Client2, the bitstring in RGB DoH of the IPv6 header is set as
   "0110".  Look up the BIFT and finds the RGB segment of next MSR6 BFR
   is P1.  The IPv6 DA is set as "P1".

   P1 receives the packet with DA as "P1", which is the local RGB
   segment.  P1 parses the DoH with RGB Option Data and looks up the
   BIFT to find the corresponding entry.  P1 replicates the packets into
   2 copies based on the look up result.  DA of one replicated packet is
   set to "C1" and the bitstring is set to "0100".  DA of the other
   replicated packet is set to "C2" and the bitstring is set to "0010".
   These 2 packets are forwarded to next hop based on the updated DA.

   P2 receives the packet and forwards it Client2 based on the DA of
   "C2".

   Client1 receives the packet with DA as "C1".  "C1" is the local RGB
   segment and "0100" identifies Client1 itself.  The packet is sent to
   the upper layer.

   Client2 receives the packet with DA as "C2".  "C2" is the local RGB
   segment and "0010" identifies Client2 itself.  The packet is sent to
   the upper layer.

 {S=CE1,D=P1}: Source address and Destination address in IPv6 header.
 [BitStr=0110]: BitString value in IPv6 Destination Options Header.
    (C-MC Pkt): Customer MultiCast packet.

   PE1 receives the customer multicast packet from CE1.  An MSR BE
   header is encapsulated as defined in section 3.  Knowing that BFR-ID
   of PE 1 is 2 and BFR-ID of PE 2 is 3, it follows that when the
   multicast service is supposed to be transmitted to PE2 and PE3, the
   bitstring in the RGB Options Header of DoH is set as "0110".  Look up
   the corresponding BIFT and finds the RGB segment of next MSR6 BFR is
   P2.  The IPv6 DA is set as "P2".

   P1 receives the packet and forwards it P2 based on the DA of "P2".

   P2 receives the packet with DA as "P2", which is the local RGB
   segment.  P2 parses the DoH with RGB Option Data and looks up the
   BIFT to find the corresponding entry.P2 replicates the packets into 2
   copies based on the look up result.  DA of one replicated packet is
   set to "PE2" and the bitstring is set to "0100".  DA of the other
   replicated packet is set to "PE3" and the bitstring is set to "0010".
   These 2 packets are forwarded to next hop based on the updated DA.

   P3 receives the packet and forwards it PE3 based on the DA of "PE3".

   PE2 receives the packet with DA as "PE2".  "PE2" is the local RGB
   segment and "0100" identifies PE2 itself.  The packet is sent to the
   multicast flow overlay.

   PE3 receives the packet with DA as "PE3".  "PE3" is the local RGB
   segment and "0010" identifies PE3 itself.  The packet is sent to the
   multicast flow overlay.


8.  IANA Considerations


8.1.  RGB Option Type

   Allocation is expected from IANA for a RGB Option Type codepoint from
   the "Destination Options and Hop-by-Hop Options" sub-registry of the
   "Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Parameters" registry.

9.  Security Considerations

   The MSR6 domain can be a single IGP area, an anonymous system (AS)
   with multiple IGP areas, or multiple anonymous systems (ASes)
   operated by a network operator.

   It is expected that all nodes in an MSR6 domain are managed by the
   same administrative entity.  MSR6-encapsulated packets should
   generally not be accepted from untrusted interfaces or tunnels.  For
   example, an operator may wish to have a policy of accepting MSR6
   encapsulated packets only from interfaces to trusted routers, and not
   from customer-facing interfaces.

   For applications that require a MSR6 Replication Endpoint to accept a
   MSR6 encapsulated packet from an interface to a system that is not
   controlled by the network operator, the security considerations of
   [RFC8296] apply

9.1.  Intra Domain Deployment

   Generally nodes outside the MSR6 Domain are not trusted: they cannot
   directly use the End.RGB segment of the domain.  This is enforced by
   two levels of access control lists:

   1.  Any packet entering the MSR6 Domain and destined to an End.RGB
   Segment within the MSR6 Domain is dropped.  This may be realized with
   the following logic.  Other methods with equivalent outcome are
   considered compliant:

   * allocate all the End.RGB Segment from a block S/s

   * configure each external interface of each edge node of the domain
   with an inbound infrastructure access list (IACL) which drops any
   incoming packet with a destination address in S/s

   * Failure to implement this method of ingress filtering may expose
   the MSR6 Domain to BIER attacks.  The security consideration on BIER
   attacks is as described and referenced in [RFC8296].

   2.  The distributed protection in #1 is complemented with per node
   protection, dropping packets to End.RGB Segment from source addresses
   outside the MSR6 Domain.  This may be realized with the following
   logic.  Other methods with equivalent outcome are considered
   compliant:

   * assign all interface addresses from prefix A/a





Liu, et al.               Expires 28 April 2022                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft            RGB Segment for MSR6              October 2021


   * assign all the IPv6 addresses used as source address of MSR6
   packets from a block B/b

   * at node k, all End.RGB Segment IPv6 addresses local to k are
   assigned from prefix Sk/sk

   * configure each internal interface of each MSR6 node k in the MSR6
   Domain with an inbound IACL which drops any incoming packet with a
   destination address in Sk/sk if the source address is not in A/a or
   B/b.

   For simplicity of deployment, a configuration of IACL effective for
   all interfaces can be provided by a router.  Such IACL can be
   referred to as global IACL(GIACL) .Each MSR6 node k then simply
   configures a GIACL which drops any incoming packet with a destination
   address in Sk/sk if the source address is not in A/a or B/b for the
   intra-domain deployment mode.


9.2.  ICMP Error Processing

   The MSR6 Replication Endpoint does not send ICMP error messages to
   the source address of a MSR BE packet, but there is still chance that
   Non-MSR6 Replication Endpoint routers send ICMP error messages to
   source nodes within the MSR6 Domain.

   A large number of ICMP may be elicited and sent to a MSR6 Ingress
   router, in case when an MSR6 BE packet is filled with wrong Hop
   Limit, either error or malfeasance.  A rate-limiting of ICMP packet
   should be implemented on each MSR6 Replication Endpoint.

   The ingress node can take note of the fact that it is getting, in
   response to MSR6 BE packet, one or more ICMP error packets.  By
   default, the reception of such packet MUST be countered and logged.
   However, it is possible for such log entries to be "false positives"
   that generate a lot of "noise" in the log; therefore, implementations
   SHOULD have a knob to disable this logging.


9.3.  Security caused by RGB option

   This document introduces a new option used in IPv6 Destination
   Options Header.  An IPv6 packet with a normal IPv6 address of a
   router (e.g. loopback IPv6 address of the router) as destination
   address will possibly carry a RGB option.

Internet-Draft            RGB Segment for MSR6              October 2021


   For a router incapable of MSR6 BE, such MSR6 BE packet will not be
   processed by the procedure described in this document, but be
   processed as normal IPv6 packet with unknown option, and the existing
   security considerations for handling IPv6 options apply.  Possible
   way of handling IPv6 packets with RGB option may be send to CPU for
   slow path processing, with rate-limiting, or be discarded according
   to the local policy.

   For a router capable of MSR6 BE, such MSR6 BE packet MUST NOT be
   forwarded, but should be processed as a normal IPv6 packet with
   unknown option, or additionally and optionally be countered and
   logged if the router is capable of doing so.
