                The Universal IPv6 Configuration Option
                draft-troan-6man-universal-ra-option-06

Abstract

   One of the original intentions for the IPv6 host configuration, was
   to configure the network-layer parameters only with IPv6 ND, and use
   service discovery for other configuration information.  Unfortunately
   that hasn't panned out quite as planned, and we are in a situation
   where all kinds of configuration options are added to RAs.  This
   document proposes a new universal option for RA in a self-describing
   data format, with the list of elements maintained in an IANA
   registry, with greatly relaxed rules for registration.

1.  Introduction

   This document proposes a new universal option for the Router
   Advertisement IPv6 ND message [RFC4861].  Its purpose is to use the
   RA messages as opaque carriers for configuration information between
   an agent on a router and a host.

   DHCP is suited to give per-client configuration information, while
   the RA mechanism advertises configuration information to all hosts on
   the link.  There is a long running history of "conflict" between the
   two.  The arguments go; there is less fate-sharing in DHCP, DHCP
   doesn't deal with multiple sources of information, or make it more
   difficult to change information independent of the lifetimes, RA
   cannot be used to configure different information to different
   clients and so on.  And of course some options are only available in
   RAs and some options are only available in DHCP.

Internet-Draft   The Universal IPv6 Configuration Option    October 2021


   While this proposal does not resolve the DHCP vs RA debate, it
   proposes a solution to the problem of a very slow process of
   standardizing new Router Advertisement options, and the IETF spending
   an inordinate amount of time arguing over new configuration options
   in Router Advertisements.  It is possible in the future to use the
   new universal option in DHCP, since this would lead to additional
   conflict resolution an additional document will need to be considered
   for that.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "*SHALL NOT*",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Additionally, the key words "*MIGHT*", "*COULD*", "*MAY WISH TO*",
   "*WOULD PROBABLY*", "*SHOULD CONSIDER*", and "*MUST (BUT WE KNOW YOU
   WON'T)*" in this document are to interpreted as described in RFC 6919
   [RFC6919].

3.  Introduction

   This document specifies a new "self-describing" universal
   configuration option.  Currently new configuration option requires
   "standards action".  The proposal is that no future IETF document
   will be required.  The configuration option is described directly in
   the universal configuration IANA registry.

4.  The Universal IPv6 Configuration option

   The option data is described using the schema language CDDL
   [RFC8610], encoded in CBOR [RFC7049].

Internet-Draft   The Universal IPv6 Configuration Option    October 2021


   Data:  CBOR encoded data.

   The Option is zero-padded to nearest 8-octet boundary.

   Example of an JSON instance of the option:

   {
       "ietf": {
           "dns": {
               "dnssl": [
                   "example.com"
               ],
               "rdnss": [
                   "2001:db8::1",
                   "2001:db8::2"
               ]
           },
           "nat64": {
               "prefix": "64:ff9b::/96"
           },
           "rio": [
               {
                   "prefix": "::/0",
                   "next-hop": "fe80::1"
               },
               {
                   "prefix": "2001:db8::/32",
                   "next-hop": "fe80::2"
               }
           ]
       }
   }

   The universal IPv6 Configuration option MUST be small enough to fit
   within a single IPv6 ND packet.  It then follows that a single
   element in the dictionary cannot be larger than what fits within a
   single option.  Different elements can be split across multiple
   universal configuration options (in separate packets).  All IANA
   registered elements are under the "ietf" key in the dictionary.
   Private configuration information can be included in the option using
   different keys.

   If information learnt via this option conflicts with other
   configuration information learnt via Router Advertisement messages,
   that is considered a configuration error.  How those conflicts should
   be resolved is left up to the implementation.

5.  CBOR encoding

   It is recommended that the user can configure the option using JSON.
   Likewise an application registering interest in an option SHOULD be
   able to use string keys.  The CBOR encoding to save space, uses
   integers for map keys.  The mapping table between integer and string
   map keys are part of the IANA registry for the option.

   Values -23-23 encodes to a single byte in CBOR, and these values are
   reserved for IETF used map keys.

6.  Implementation Guidance

   The purpose of this option is to allow users to use the RA as an
   opaque carrier for configuration information without requiring code
   changes in the option carrying infrastructure.

   On the router there should be an API allowing a user to add an
   element, e.g. a JSON object [RFC8259] or a pre-encoded CBOR string to
   RAs sent on a given interface.

   On the host side, an API SHOULD be available allowing applications to
   subscribe to received configuration elements.  It SHOULD be possible
   to subscribe to configuration object by dictionary key.

   The contents of any elements that are not recognized, either in whole
   or in part, by the receiving host MUST be ignored and the remainder
   of option's contents MUST be processed as normal.

   An implementation SHOULD provide a "JSON interface" for configuring
   the option.

7.  Implementation Status

   The Universal IPv6 configuration option sending side is implemented
   in VPP (https://wiki.fd.io/view/VPP (https://wiki.fd.io/view/VPP)).

   The implementation is a prototype released under Apache license and
   available at: https://github.com/vpp-dev/vpp/
   commit/156db316565e77de30890f6e9b2630bd97b0d61d (https://github.com/
   vpp-dev/vpp/commit/156db316565e77de30890f6e9b2630bd97b0d61d).

8.  Security Considerations

   Unless there is a security relationship between the host and the
   router (e.g.  SEND), and even then, the consumer of configuration
   information can put no trust in the information received.

9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add a new registry for the Universal IPv6
   Configuration option.  The registry should be named "IPv6 Universal
   Configuration Information Option".

   The schema field follows the CDDL schema definition in [RFC8610].

   Changes and additions to the registry follow the policies below
   [RFC8126]:

          +============================+========================+
          | Range                      | Registration Procedure |
          +============================+========================+

          +----------------------------+------------------------+

                                  Table 1

   A new registration requires a new CBOR key to parameter name
   assignment and a CDDL definition.

9.1.  Universal configuration option

   The IANA is requested to add the universal option to the "IPv6
   Neighbor Discovery Option Formats" registry with the value of 42.

9.2.  Initial objects in the registry

   The PVD [RFC8801] elements and DNS [RFC8106]) are included to provide
   an alternative representation for the proposed new options in that
   draft.

9.3.  Initial objects in the registry
