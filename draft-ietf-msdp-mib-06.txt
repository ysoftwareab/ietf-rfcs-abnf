This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management Information
Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
community.  In particular, it describes managed objects used for
managing Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) [2] speakers.

1.  The SNMP Management Framework

The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
components:

o An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [3].

o Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
  purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
  Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16,
  RFC 1155 [4], STD 16, RFC 1212 [5] and RFC 1215 [6]. The second
  version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [7], STD 58,
  RFC 2579 [8] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [9].

o Message protocols for transferring management information.  The first
  version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in
  STD 15, RFC 1157 [10]. A second version of the SNMP message protocol,
  which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c
  and described in RFC 1901 [11] and RFC 1906 [12]. The third version of
  the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [12],
  RFC 2572 [13] and RFC 2574 [14].

o Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The first
  set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
  STD 15, RFC 1157 [10]. A second set of protocol operations and
  associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [15].

o A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [16] and the
  view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 [17].

A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
can be found in RFC 2570 [18].

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are defined
using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A MIB
conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
MIB.

2.  Revision History

A record of changes which will be removed before publication.

18 July 2001

     Since the INET-ADDRESS-MIB relaxed restrictions on InetAddressType,
     remove msdpPeerLocalAddressType, rename msdpSACacheGroupAddrType to
     msdpCacheAddrType, remove msdpCacheSourceAddrType,
     msdpSACacheOriginRPType, msdpSACachePeerLearnedFromType,
     msdpSACacheRPFPeerType.

     Updated the DESCRIPTION of msdpRequestsTable to describe exactly
     how it is used.

     Added msdpPeerDiscontinuityTime.

     Changed msdpPeerFsmEstablishedTime to a TimeStamp instead of a
     counting number of seconds.

     Changed msdpPeerInMessageElapsedTime to msdpPeerInMessageTime and
     changed it to a TimeStamp.

     Added msdpMeshGroupTable.

     Updated conformance information.

1 March 2001

     Added msdpPeerIfIndex.

     Converted all IpAddress items to InetAddressType/InetAddress pairs.
     This bigtime violates RFC2578's rules about MIB evolution, so take
     extra care when implementing this change.

INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: January 2002                July 2001


     Added msdpRequestsPriority, in order to allow configuration of
     multiple peers to whom Requests will be sent.  Note that this
     violates RFC2578's rules about MIB evolution, so take extra care
     when implementing this change.

     Removed DEFVAL on scalars, since it should only be needed for table
     row creation.

     Removed msdpPeerSAAdvPeriod, since the spec changed to say its
     value MUST be 60.

     Added none(0) to msdpPeerEncapsulationType enumeration XXX is this
     OK? should it be 4?

     Removed msdpPeerEncapsulationState since the encapsulation
     "negotiation" was removed from the spec.

     Added msdpRPAddress to specify the RP address to use when sourcing
     SA messages.

     Added msdpSACacheSourcePrefix to msdpSACacheTable, and added it to
     the INDEX.  Note that this violates RFC2578's rules about MIB
     evolution, so take extra care when implementing this change.

     Completely renumbered the MIB, removing the extra level of
     msdpMIBobjects and creating an msdpScalars group to contain all
     scalars.  Note that this violates RFC2578's rules about MIB
     evolution, so take extra care when implementing this change.

16 December 1999

     Added msdpSAHoldDownPeriod, msdpPeerEncapsulationState,
     msdpPeerEncapsulationType, msdpPeerConnectionAttempts,
     msdpPeerInNotifications, msdpPeerOutNotifications, and
     msdpLastError

     Removed msdpPeerConfigMethod, since this has disappeared from the
     spec.

     Renamed the states in msdpPeerState to go with the state machine in
     the spec.

     Added msdpPeerLocalPort and msdpPeerRemotePort in order to provide
     full information about the TCP connection in use.  I'd like to
     reorder the Peer Table but that can wait until the MIB gets
     published as an RFC in order to only change things like that once.

INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: January 2002                July 2001


     Added msdpSACacheOriginRP as an INDEX to the msdpSACacheTable.
     Note that this violates RFC2578's rules about MIB evolution, so
     take extra care when implementing this change.

25 June 1999

     Renamed to DRAFT-MSDP-MIB.  It will be renamed back to MSDP-MIB
     when it gets renumbered under mib-2, in order to avoid module
     naming problems.

     Turned msdpSendRequestsTo into a table in order to handle
     administratively scoped groups with different RP's.

27 May 1999

     Added IANA-assigned experimental OID

     Added msdpSendRequestsTo and msdpPeerProcessRequestsFrom to
     configure MSDP SA-Request/Response processing.

     Added msdpPeerDataTtl to allow TTL scoping of data packets
     forwarded across MSDP peerings.

     Renumbered msdpSACacheInDataPackets and further items in
     msdpSACacheTable, to eliminate duplicate OIDs

20 April 1999

     initial version.


3.  Overview

This MIB module contains three scalars and three tables.  The tables
are:

o    the Requests Table, containing the longest-match table used to
     determine the peer to send SA-Requests to for a given group;

o    the Peer Table, containing information on the peers; and

o    the Source-Active Cache Table, containing the SA cache entries.

5.  Open Issues

Do we need an msdpPeerLastErrorSent, too, for what notification I last
sent to this peer?

The Backwards Transition notification won't trigger on established ->
disabled.  Is that desired?

A table to express policy was suggested on the MSDP mailing list.  More
discussion is required before including this in the MIB.  (Some of the
more discussion: other than filtering announcements at an RP, policy in
MSDP == black holes; policy should be in MBGP)

An OID for control of encapsulation (e.g. SA-encapsulate the first N
packets sent to this group?) was suggested, although it might be more
appropriate to be a table for fine-grained control.

Is the RowStatus object in the SACache appropriate?  (e.g. used to flush
potentially bad state)

Should there be a mechanism to describe alternate methods of RPF?  (e.g.
statically configured peer address and RP address lists - could be a
table indexed by peer address and RP address with a value of
accept/deny)  One or more MSDP default-peers?

Is it appropriate to use names to distinguish mesh groups?

Are there any other variables appropriate for configuring/managing mesh
groups?

Should the UDP port used for encapsulation be in the Peer table?

6.  Security Considerations


There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that have a

INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: January 2002                July 2001


MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects may be
considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The
support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
sensitive information. These are:

 -- XXX fill this in

It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them
over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features
for such a secure environment.

SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET
(read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features
as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of the User-
based Security Model RFC 2574 [14] and the View-based Access Control
Model RFC 2575 [17] is recommended.

It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity
giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly configured to give
access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have
legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
