Abstract

   This document specifies the extensions to ICMP that allows
   routing instance information to be included inside the ICMP
   packet. These extensions can be used to facilitate the
   troubleshooting network problems within a routing domain or
   across multiple routing domains.

Internet-Draft          ICMP Routing Instance              November 2006


2.  Introduction

   Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) [1] has been widely
   used for troubleshooting purposes. This document utilizes the
   ICMP multi-part message extension [2] to define a number of
   important routing instance objects in ICMP messages.

   When using traceroute diagnostic tool through multiple routing
   domains, it is useful to have ICMP Time exceeded messages to
   include the AS number [3] the router or virtual router
   belongs to.

   Within the same routing domain, if a network operates with multiple
   topologies for IGP [4, 5], it is crucial in network troubleshooting
   to know the multi-topology identifier the traceroute packet of
   inbound interface is associated with. This information can be
   included in the ICMP messages.

   With the traditional Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) diagnostics,
   it is useful for the ICMP Time exceeded messages to report
   OSPF area [6] the router belongs to or to report the IS-IS [7]
   level the router or link belong to when the IGP being IS-IS.
   The OSPF area and IS-IS level can also belong to a specific
   routing instance the inbound interface is associated with for
   the traceroute packets.
   
   A router may support VRRP [9] over a LAN interface and it is
   informative to know if the interface has redundancy protection and
   it's configured virtual router identifier (VRID).


3. ICMP Multiple-part Message Extension

   This document uses the ICMP extension [2]. The ICMP message
   MUST include the IP header and leading payload octets of the
   original datagram.  An ICMP Extension Structure Header MUST
   follow the octets from the original datagram and come before
   any ICMP Extension Objects.


4. Routing Objects for ICMP

   This section defines a number of ICMP routing instance objects that
   can be optionally appended to the ICMP Time Exceeded and Destination
   Unreachable messages.

4.1 Autonomous System Number Object

   The router MAY include the AS number [3] when sending out the
   ICMP messages.

   Figure 6: VRID Object

   Virtual Router ID is an 8 bit number.


5. Security Considerations

   These ICMP extensions can provide operators with additional routing
   information during network troubleshooting. It may be desirable to
   provide this information only to network operators. This may be
   desirable in particular for the IGP routing related objects. The
   implementation should allow the configuration of the policy control
   over the operation of these objects. For example, an access list
   can be attached to check the IP destination of the ICMP packets
   with this extension belong to internal network management subnet.


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA should should reserve from the ICMP Extension Object registry:
   5 for the routing instance objects. IANA should also reserve
   from the objects c-types as described in section 4 of this
   document.
