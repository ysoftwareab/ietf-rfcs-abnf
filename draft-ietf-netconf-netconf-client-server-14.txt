Abstract

   This document defines two YANG modules, one module to configure a
   NETCONF client and the other module to configure a NETCONF server.
   Both modules support both the SSH and TLS transport protocols, and
   support both standard NETCONF and NETCONF Call Home connections.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines two YANG [RFC7950] modules, one module to
   configure a NETCONF [RFC6241] client and the other module to
   configure a NETCONF server.  Both modules support both NETCONF over
   SSH [RFC6242] and NETCONF over TLS [RFC7589] and NETCONF Call Home
   connections [RFC8071].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  The NETCONF Client Model

   The NETCONF client model presented in this section supports both
   clients initiating connections to servers, as well as clients
   listening for connections from servers calling home, using either the
   SSH and TLS transport protocols.

   YANG feature statements are used to enable implementations to
   advertise which potentially uncommon parts of the model the NETCONF
   client supports.

3.1.  Tree Diagram

   The following tree diagram [RFC8340] provides an overview of the data
   model for the "ietf-netconf-client" module.

   This tree diagram only shows the nodes defined in this module; it
   does show the nodes defined by "grouping" statements used by this
   module.

   Please see Appendix A.1 for a tree diagram that illustrates what the
   module looks like with all the "grouping" statements expanded.

3.2.  Example Usage

   The following example illustrates configuring a NETCONF client to
   initiate connections, using both the SSH and TLS transport protocols,
   as well as listening for call-home connections, again using both the
   SSH and TLS transport protocols.

   This example is consistent with the examples presented in Section 2
   of [I-D.ietf-netconf-trust-anchors] and Section 3.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].

4.  The NETCONF Server Model

   The NETCONF server model presented in this section supports both
   listening for connections as well as initiating call-home
   connections, using either the SSH and TLS transport protocols.

   YANG feature statements are used to enable implementations to
   advertise which potentially uncommon parts of the model the NETCONF
   server supports.

4.1.  Tree Diagram

   The following tree diagram [RFC8340] provides an overview of the data
   model for the "ietf-netconf-server" module.

   This tree diagram only shows the nodes defined in this module; it
   does show the nodes defined by "grouping" statements used by this
   module.

   Please see Appendix A.2 for a tree diagram that illustrates what the
   module looks like with all the "grouping" statements expanded.

4.2.  Example Usage

   The following example illustrates configuring a NETCONF server to
   listen for NETCONF client connections using both the SSH and TLS
   transport protocols, as well as configuring call-home to two NETCONF
   clients, one using SSH and the other using TLS.

   This example is consistent with the examples presented in Section 2
   of [I-D.ietf-netconf-trust-anchors] and Section 3.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].

   The NETCONF access control model (NACM) [RFC8341] provides the means
   to restrict access for particular users to a pre-configured subset of
   all available protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG modules that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  Some of these data nodes may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g.,
   edit-config) to these data nodes without proper protection can have a
   negative effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and
   data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      None of the subtrees or data nodes in the modules defined in this
   document need to be protected from write operations.

   Some of the readable data nodes in the YANG modules may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      None of the subtrees or data nodes in the modules defined in this
   document need to be protected from read operations.

   Some of the RPC operations in the YANG modules may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control access to these operations.  These are the
   operations and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      The modules defined in this document do not define any 'RPC' or
   'action' statements.

Appendix B.  Change Log

B.1.  00 to 01

   o  Renamed "keychain" to "keystore".

B.2.  01 to 02

   o  Added to ietf-netconf-client ability to connected to a cluster of
      endpoints, including a reconnection-strategy.

   o  Added to ietf-netconf-client the ability to configure connection-
      type and also keep-alive strategy.

   o  Updated both modules to accommodate new groupings in the ssh/tls
      drafts.

B.3.  02 to 03

   o  Refined use of tls-client-grouping to add a must statement
      indicating that the TLS client must specify a client-certificate.

   o  Changed 'netconf-client' to be a grouping (not a container).

B.4.  03 to 04

   o  Added RFC 8174 to Requirements Language Section.

   o  Replaced refine statement in ietf-netconf-client to add a
      mandatory true.

   o  Added refine statement in ietf-netconf-server to add a must
      statement.

   o  Now there are containers and groupings, for both the client and
      server models.

B.5.  04 to 05

   o  Now tree diagrams reference ietf-netmod-yang-tree-diagrams

   o  Updated examples to inline key and certificates (no longer a
      leafref to keystore)

B.6.  05 to 06

   o  Fixed change log missing section issue.

   o  Updated examples to match latest updates to the crypto-types,
      trust-anchors, and keystore drafts.

   o  Reduced line length of the YANG modules to fit within 69 columns.

B.7.  06 to 07

   o  Removed "idle-timeout" from "persistent" connection config.

   o  Added "random-selection" for reconnection-strategy's "starts-with"
      enum.

   o  Replaced "connection-type" choice default (persistent) with
      "mandatory true".

   o  Reduced the periodic-connection's "idle-timeout" from 5 to 2
      minutes.

   o  Replaced reconnect-timeout with period/anchor-time combo.

B.8.  07 to 08

   o  Modified examples to be compatible with new crypto-types algs

B.9.  08 to 09

   o  Corrected use of "mandatory true" for "address" leafs.

   o  Updated examples to reflect update to groupings defined in the
      keystore draft.

   o  Updated to use groupings defined in new TCP and HTTP drafts.

   o  Updated copyright date, boilerplate template, affiliation, and
      folding algorithm.

B.10.  09 to 10

   o  Reformatted YANG modules.

B.11.  10 to 11

   o  Adjusted for the top-level "demux container" added to groupings
      imported from other modules.

   o  Added "must" expressions to ensure that keepalives are not
      configured for "periodic" connections.

   o  Updated the boilerplate text in module-level "description"
      statement to match copyeditor convention.

   o  Moved "expanded" tree diagrams to the Appendix.

B.12.  11 to 12

   o  Removed the "Design Considerations" section.

   o  Removed the 'must' statement limiting keepalives in periodic
      connections.

   o  Updated models and examples to reflect removal of the "demux"
      containers in the imported models.

   o  Updated the "periodic-connnection" description statements to be
      more like the RESTCONF draft, especially where it described
      dropping the underlying TCP connection.

   o  Updated text to better reference where certain examples come from
      (e.g., which Section in which draft).

   o  In the server model, commented out the "must 'pinned-ca-certs or
      pinned-client-certs'" statement to reflect change made in the TLS
      draft whereby the trust anchors MAY be defined externally.

   o  Replaced the 'listen', 'initiate', and 'call-home' features with
      boolean expressions.

B.13.  12 to 13

   o  Updated to reflect changes in trust-anchors drafts (e.g., s/trust-
      anchors/truststore/g + s/pinned.//)

B.14.  13 to 14

   o  Adjusting from change in TLS client model (removing the top-level
      'certificate' container), by swapping refining-in a 'mandatory
      true' statement with a 'must' statement outside the 'uses'
      statement.
