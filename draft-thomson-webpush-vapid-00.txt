        Voluntary Application Server Identification for Web Push
                     draft-thomson-webpush-vapid-00

Abstract

   An application server can voluntarily identify itself to a push
   service using the described technique.  This identification
   information can be used by the push service to attribute requests
   that are made by the same application server to a single entity.  An
   application server is further able include additional information the
   operator of a push service can use to contact the operator of the
   application server.

1.  Introduction

   The Web Push protocol [I-D.ietf-webpush-protocol] describes how an
   application server is able to request that a push service deliver a
   push message to a user agent.

   As a consequence of the expected deployment architecture, there is no
   basis for an application server to be known to a push service prior
   to requesting delivery of a push message.  By the same measure,
   requesting the creation of a subscription for push message receipts
   has no prior authentication.  Requiring that the push service be able
   to authenticate application servers places an unwanted constraint on
   the interactions between user agents and application servers, who are
   the ultimate users of a push service.  That constraint would also
   degrade the privacy-preserving properties the protocol provides.  For
   these reasons, [I-D.ietf-webpush-protocol] does not define a
   mandatory system for authentication of application servers.

   An unfortunate consequence of this design is that a push service is
   exposed to a greater risk of denial of service attack.  While
   requests from application servers can be indirectly attributed to
   user agents, this is not always efficient or even sufficient.
   Providing more information about the application server more directly
   to a push service allows the push service to better distinguish
   between legitimate and bogus requests.

   This document describes a system whereby an application server can
   volunteer information about itself to a push service.  At a minimum,

   this provides a stable identity for the application server, though
   this could also include contact information, such as an email
   address.

   A consistent identity can be used by a push service to establish
   behavioral expectations for an application server.  Significant
   deviations from an established norm can then be used to trigger
   exception handling procedures.

   Voluntarily-provided contact information can be used to contact an
   application server operator in the case of exceptional situations.

   Experience with push service deployment has shown that software
   errors or unusual circumstances can cause large increases in push
   message volume.  Contacting the operator of the application server
   has proven to be valuable.

   Even in the absence of usable contact information, an application
   server that has a well-established reputation might be given
   preference over an unidentified application server when choosing
   whether to discard a push message.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", and "MAY" are used in this
   document.  It's not shouting, when they are capitalized, they have
   the special meaning described in [RFC2119].

   The terms "push message", "push service", "application server", and
   "user agent" are used as defined in [I-D.ietf-webpush-protocol]

2.  Self-Identification

   A push service that supports application server self-identification
   requests a client certificate from application servers.  The client
   certificate is requested during the TLS [RFC5246] handshake.

   An application server that does not have a client certificate offers
   no certificate in response; an application server that wishes to
   self-identify includes a certificate.

   The certificate that the application server offers SHOULD be self-
   signed (see Section 3.2 of [RFC5280]).  The certificate MAY contain
   an alternative name extension (Section 4.2.1.6 of [RFC5280]) that
   includes contact information.  Of the available options, an email
   address using the "rfc822Name" form or an HTTP [RFC7230] (or HTTPS
   [RFC2818]) "uniformResourceIdentifier" SHOULD be included, though
   including other options are not prohibited.

   The offered end-entity certificate or the public key it contains
   becomes an identifier for the application server.  Push services are
   able to reduce the data they retain for an application server, either
   by extracting important information like the subject public key
   information (SPKI), by hashing, or a combination.  Of course, a push
   service might choose to ignore the provided information.

   To avoid requesting certificates from user agents, it might be
   necessary to serve requests from user agents and requests from
   application servers on different hostnames or port numbers.

2.1.  Alternatives

   Several options have been proposed, here are some of the more
   concrete options.  Some options might even be better than the
   certificate-based option.

2.1.1.  Application Tokens

   In this model, the push service vends a token to each application
   server that requests it.  That token is kept secret and used as the
   basis for authentication.

   This doesn't address the need for contact information, but it
   addresses the need for a consistent application server identifier.

   A Cookie [RFC6265] is a token of this nature.  All the considerations
   regarding the use (and misuse) of HTTP cookies apply should this
   option be chosen.  A mechanism that makes token theft more difficult,
   such as [I-D.ietf-tokbind-https] might be needed.  However that
   suggests a separate option (see Section 2.1.4).

   This information would be repeated with each request, but that
   overhead is greatly reduced by header compression [RFC7541] in HTTP/2
   [RFC7540].

2.1.2.  Contact Information Header Field

   Contact information for an application server could be included in a
   header field, either directly (e.g., a From header field,
   Section 5.5.1 of [RFC7231]), or by reference (e.g., a new "contact"
   link relation [RFC5988] that identified a vCard [RFC6350]).  Note
   that a From header field is limited to email addresses.

   Like an application token Section 2.1.1, contact information would
   need to be repeated, though that cost is reduced with HTTP/2.

2.1.3.  Request Signing

   Signing of push message requests would allow the push service to
   attribute requests to an application server based on an asymmetric
   key.  This could be done in any number of ways JWS [RFC7515] and HTTP
   signatures [I-D.cavage-http-signatures] being the most likely
   options.  Note that the latter does not provide a means of conveying
   the signing key, which would be necessary for this application.

   Request signing has several limitations:

   o  Deciding what to sign is challenging.  Signing only the body of a
      message is not sufficient to prevent message replay attacks.

   o  Every message contains a signature, which can increase the load on
      a server signficantly.  This is especially bad if a signature
      validation result is input to denial of service mitigation
      decision making.

2.1.4.  Token Binding

   The mechanism proposed in [I-D.ietf-tokbind-https] can be used to
   provide a stable identifier for application servers.  This includes a
   signature over material that is exported from the underlying TLS
   connection.  Importantly, this does not require a new signature for
   each request: the same signature is repeated for every request,
   HTTP/2 is again used to reduce the cost of the repeated information.

   Token binding could be used independently of cookies.  Consequently,
   an application server would not be required to accept and store
   cookies, though the push service would not be able to offload any
   state as a result.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions (yet).

4.  Security Considerations

   TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] does not provide any confidentiality protections
   for client certificates.  A network attacker can therefore see the
   identification information that is provided by the application
   server.  A push service MAY choose to offer confidentiality
   protection for application server identity by initiating TLS
   renegotiation immediately after establishing the TLS connection at
   the cost of some additional latency.  Using TLS 1.3
   [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13] provides confidentiality protection for this
   information without additional latency.

   An application server might offer falsified contact information.  A
   push service operator therefore cannot use the presence of
   unvalidated contact information as input to any security-critical
   decision-making process.
