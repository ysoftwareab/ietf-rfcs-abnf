Abstract

   This document defines a new Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 
   (DHC) Option to allow one or more URIs to be transmitted from a 
   server to a client within one or more messages, and for one or more 
   URIs, each with a unique purpose, to be specifically requested by a 
   client of a server.  Included in this Option is a purpose field to 
   identify the type of URI being requested by the client, or the type 
   of URI in the DHCP message from the server.

1.  Introduction

   There are times in which a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is an 
   essential part of configuration information necessary for usage by 
   an endpoint (client) for the particular purpose of contacting what 
   is at that URI.  This document defines a new Dynamic Host 
   Configuration Protocol (DHC) Option [RFC 2131] to allow URIs of 
   specific types, or purposes, to be requested by a client of a 
   server, and transmitted unrequested from a server to a client.  
   Because URIs can be used for many purposes, and to ensure 
   extensibility, this client option has a sub-option "purpose" field 
   to identify the type of URI included in the message.

   This document specifies one DHCP Option for all URIs, allowing up to 
   255 uniquely identified URIs to be defined as sub-options.  The 
   format for this comes from [RFC3396].  This document will IANA 
   Register each purpose URI for interoperability.

Internet-Draft               DHC URI Option                   Sept 2005

   This document does not limit the means of an client from gaining 
   knowledge of a URI to DHCP, but provides DHCP as a means for a 
   client to gain knowledge of a URI or series of URIs determined 
   through local configuration, that are considered essential for use 
   by applications within that client.  The decision of when one or 
   more URIs are essential MAY be made at client boot-up, or when a 
   particular application launches.  

   One example of this URI download could be one specifically for the 
   SIP or SIPS URI of the appropriate Public Safety Answer Point (PSAP)
   for the client when the user calls for emergency help (911 or 112-
   type of help).  This is not a transaction that should take place 
   when a voice application wants to make such a critical call set-up. 
   It is more appropriate that this information be downloaded to the 
   client when the voice (or other) application boots up in case it is 
   needed at a later time.  

   A Link Provider (LP) would be in a better position to have knowledge
   of where the client is than an Internet Provider (IP); the latter 
   becoming more divorced from the physical location of the client, 
   especially in the case of the IP being an Application Provider (AP) 
   on a regional, national or international scale.  This was part of 
   the motivation for Option 123 (GeoConf) [RFC 3825].

   Examples of Link Providers are DSL providers with known endpoints of
   their cabling infrastructure, Hybrid Fiber Coax (HFC) Cable 
   providers with knowledge of where their logical endpoints are, and 
   small or large enterprise infrastructures.  The DSL or HFC Cable 
   provides are not limited in this context to a single client at the 
   subscriber's endpoint, but could have few to many clients being 
   served by an access device of those infrastructures, all with a 
   common need for the particular URI, or series of URIs.

   A client may request more than one URI be sent to it within the same
   DHCPDISCOVER or DHCPREQUEST message.  Each URI will be inside its 
   own payload container with an Option number, a length field and a 
   purpose field.  This means that if more than one URI is being 
   requested or downloaded, there can be more than one DHCP Option XXX 
   (this document's option number) in the same IP message.  Each URI 
   will be inside the DHCP Option payload shown in section 2 of this 
   document.  There is no meaning to the order of URIs in a message.  

   Awareness of how stale a URI may become is something local 
   administrators should consider when implementing this Option.  DHCP 
   servers are assumed to periodically query an authoritative source 
   providing non-stale URIs.  How this is accomplished is most likely 
   not through the use of DHCP and is out of scope for this document.

   Section 1.2 reviews the terminology and acronyms used in this 
   document that are fairly new to DHCP.  Section 2.1 discusses the 
   rules of usage of this Option.  Section 3 lists the unique numbering
   of the purpose fields to the purpose type that is explained in

   section 3.1 - 3.11.  Section 4 discusses open issues to be 
   addressed. Section 5 is the IANA Considerations section of this DHCP
   Option as well as the purpose field sub-options.

      talking the local emergency calls from people in distress.  This 
      facility can be logical, and can transfer (reroute) any request 
      sent to it to another facility deemed more appropriate to receive
      the request.

   Code =        The IANA Assigned Option number

   Length =      This is a variable length value of the number of bytes 
                 in the Option, including this length field

   URI Purpose = This is what the URI is used for by applications 
                 within the client

   URI Length  = The length of the URI associated with a particular 
                 purpose, whether or not there are any other URIs in 
                 the message

   URI         = This is a variable length field containing the URI 
                 being transmitted, to a maximum of 253 bytes in length


2.1  Rules of Usage

   The following are the rules of usage of this DHCP Option:

   - Each DHCP Option compliant with this document will have the same 
     Option number

   - The Length field is for the overall length of the Option (there 
     are URI option fields per purpose)

   - Each URI requested for by a client, or transmitted by the server, 
     MUST have a purpose identifier indicating the intended usage for 
     this URI by applications within the client

   - there MAY be more than one URI requested by the client in the same
     message

   - If more than one URI is requested for by the client, or 
     transmitted by the server unsolicited, each MUST be in separate 
     "purpose" subsection of the message

   - Each purpose suboption will have its own URI Length field for 
     that URI only

   - No URI Length field will be more than 253 (bytes), complying with 
     [RFC2131]


Polk                       Expires March, 2006                 [Page 6]
Internet-Draft               DHC URI Option                   Sept 2005

   - [RFC2131] limits the size of an Option to 255 bytes, and this 
     Option is no different.  If there are more than one URI to be sent
     to a client, and the aggregate byte count is greater than 255 
     bytes, the URIs will be sent in more than one message to the 
     client.

   - Clients making a request for one or more URIs will send a 
     message to the Server with URI length fields set to zero 

   - Clients MUST NOT request the same purpose more than once in the 
     same message, but are not limited in how frequently they can make 
     new requests - even for the same URI purpose

   - Clients MUST be prepared to support [RFC3396] for multiple URIs

   - Server responses to a request for more than one URI MAY be in 
     separate messages (i.e. one URI per message), at the server's 
     discretion 

   - Certain URI fields MAY be populated with a URL of a server

   - Purpose=6 "URI of Organization Providing Location Configuration 
     Information" SHOULD be included when Option 123 (GeoConf) or the 
     Option for [ID-CIVIC] is requested of a server and when downloaded
     to the client.

   - URIs that denote public identifiers, such as for a PSAP, are not 
     as much at risk as other URIs transmitted to the client.  That 
     said, URIs with specific information of the client, such as its 
     location by-reference URI SHOULD NOT be transmitted by the server 
     without being requested by the client first, and SHOULD only be 
     requested by the client once it learns the specific IP address of 
     the server.


2.2 Multiple URIs in a message

   There MAY be one URI in the message.  However, there MAY be more 
   than one URI - requiring a means to know when one stops and the 
   other one starts.  The code field is the same in either case.  The 
   Option length field is overall message length in bytes, minus the 
   Option number byte and the Option Length byte.  The next byte is a 
   URI purpose byte, followed by a URI Length byte. If this length 
   value is not one byte less than the Option Length value, the DHCP 
   entity knows there is more than one URI in this message.  This first
   URI Length field determines the exact number of bytes in this first 
   URI.  The next byte after this field is the purpose byte of the next
   URI, followed by its URI length field.  If the addition of these two
   URI length fields is not two bytes less than the Option Length field
   value, the DHCP entity knows there is at least one more URI in this 
   message.  This process continues until the byte counts match, or 
   they do not - which means there is an length error.

Internet-Draft               DHC URI Option                   Sept 2005

   Here is the pseudo-format of such a message

   [code] [length] [purpose] [uri length] [uri text] [purpose] [uri 
   length] [uri text] [purpose] [uri length] [uri text] [etc]


2.3 Requesting a URI of a Server

   Clients can request one or more URIs of a server.  Here is the 
   pseudo-format of such a request:

   [code] [length] [purpose] [uri length=0] [purpose] [uri Length=0] 
   [purpose] [uri length=0] [etc...]

   The client builds a proper message and zeros out the uri-length 
   fields and does not include anything in the uri fields.  There is no
   limit to the number of URIs a client can request - except:

   - the Option maximum length is 253 bytes,

   - that the same URI purpose cannot be in the message more than once,

   - there is a limit on the number of available purposes to include.  

   Conceivably though, each available URI purpose MAY be in a DHC 
   message.  The client MUST be prepared to receive each URI requested,
   even in separate messages from the server.  The client MUST NOT 
   request the same URI purpose more than once in the same message.


3.  Purposes of Different URI Types

   This section lists the initial set of purpose fields which can be 
   used by a client for different requests, or a server for different 
   transmissions:

   Purpose = 1  (Primary PSAP URI)
   Purpose = 2  (Secondary PSAP URI)
   Purpose = 3  (Location By-Reference URI of Client)
   Purpose = 4  (ESGW URI of Client)
   Purpose = 5  (ESRP URI of Client)
   Purpose = 6  (Organization Providing Location for Client)
   Purpose = 7  (URI of Geocoding/Reverse Geocoding)
   Purpose = 8  (Primary URI of Geo Mapping Service)
   Purpose = 9  (Secondary URI of Geo Mapping Service)
   Purpose = 10 (Primary URI of Civic Mapping Service)
   Purpose = 11 (Secondary URI of Civic Mapping Service)

   Others can be added based on discussion of this document.

Internet-Draft               DHC URI Option                   Sept 2005

3.1  Primary SIP/SIPS URI of Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)

   This purpose=1 URI is the primary URI used by a SIP [RFC3261] 
   enabled element in the Request-URI field for the appropriate PSAP 
   for this client when the SIP user agent (UA) is attempting to call 
   for emergency help (such as the police or ambulance).  


3.2  Secondary SIP/SIPS URI of Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)

   Related to Purpose=1.  This purpose=2 URI is the secondary or backup
   SIP or SIPS URI of same PSAP facility or of another PSAP facility to
   be used when the primary URI fails to connect, due to a timeout or a
   SIP final failure message.  This SHOULD NOT be used if the initial 
   attempt to contact the PSAP fails for any reason, as many failures 
   are recoverable within SIP [RFC 3261].  In fact, many non-successful
   responses are not uncommon in SIP before a transaction is 
   successfully responded to.  


3.3  Client's Location By-Reference URI

   This purpose=3 URI is the pointer to the client's by-reference 
   location on a server external to the client [ID-SIP-LOC].  Location 
   of a client can be signified in two ways: 

      by-value - meaning the client possesses its location information 
                 locally, and

      by-reference - meaning the client's location information is 
                 stored on a remote element such as a server.  

   Storing location information by-reference external to the client may
   be for many reasons, including because the client does not know how 
   to store its location, because the client chooses to store it 
   remotely for a URI reference to be given to others to save bandwidth
   during transmission, or because a service provider may decide to 
   keep this information from the client by-value.  If the client knows
   where its location is by-reference, it merely needs to provide that 
   reference to another entity when it decides to reveal where it is.  
   This URI is the retrieval identifier for a protocol to fetch the 
   client's location from.  Examples of usable protocols are: HTTP, 
   SIP, etc.


3.4  SIP/SIPS URI of Emergency Services Gateway (ESGW)

   This purpose=4 URI is for the Emergency Services Gateway that an IP 
   client would contact when setting up an emergency call with a PSAP 
   that is not IP enabled.  Having this information locally in the
   client will allow it to contact the ESGW directly and not have to 
   rely on an intermediary to determine which ESGW is the right one for

   this client, and possibly fail the call set-up during that 
   determination.


3.5  SIP/SIPS URI of Emergency Services Routing Proxy (ESRP)

   This purpose=5 URI is for the Emergency Services Routing Proxy that 
   is tasked with determining which PSAP the client needs to contact 
   when attempting to establish a call with a PSAP.  In SIP for 
   example, not all SIP Proxies or intermediaries are expected to have 
   knowledge of how to determine which is the appropriate PSAP of a 
   client based on where the client is located.  There may be difficult
   in a non-updated SIP intermediary in this determination, even in 
   determining which SIP intermediary knows how to do this function.  
   This SIP/SIPS URI is the Request-URI of such a SIP intermediary that
   knows how to determine which is the correct PSAP given the included 
   PIDF-LO [ID-SIP-LOC] in the session set-up message (the SIP INVITE) 
   to that intermediary.


3.6  URI of Organization Providing Location Configuration Information 

   This purpose=6 URI is the organization that provided location 
   configuration information (LCI) to the DHCP client.  In building a 
   proper XML Location Message Body [ID-PIDF-LO], the location 
   generator [RFC 3693] will include a <provided-by> element indicating
   which organization was responsible for delivering this location 
   information to the client.  This URI is used to populate this 
   <provided-by> element without further interaction.  


3.7  URI for Geocoding or Reverse Geocoding Function

   This purpose=7 URI of a server that can perform a geocoding or 
   reverse geocoding function.  DHCP has the ability to provide 
   Location Configuration Information to a client in the geo format 
   using Option 123 [RFC 3825] or the civic format [ID-CIVIC], or the 
   client can learn is location through manual configuration or an 
   internal GPS process.  Various applications on a client MAY prefer 
   one format over another and not possess the ability to geocode or 
   reverse geocode the available location information.  This URI 
   (purpose=7) provides the client with the server known to have this 
   ability prior to the client requiring the new format.


3.8  Primary URI for Geo Mapping Service

   This purpose=8 URI gives the client the ability to transmit its 
   location, perhaps downloaded from DHCP Option 123 [RFC3825], and 
   contact a "primary" server at this URI to perform a location-to-
   PSAP-URI mapping function before the client attempts to contact a 
   PSAP.

   This transmission of client location to the primary mapping server 
   that includes the request to map this location to the appropriate 
   PSAP for that location is done with another protocol, and not DHCP.


3.9  Secondary URI for Geo Mapping Service

   This purpose=9 URI gives the client the ability to transmit its 
   location, perhaps downloaded from DHCP Option 123 [RFC3825], and 
   contact a "secondary" server at this URI to perform a location-to-
   PSAP-URI mapping function before the client attempts to contact a 
   PSAP.  

   This transmission of client location to the secondary mapping server
   that includes the request to map this location to the appropriate 
   PSAP for that location is done with another protocol, and not DHCP.


3.10 Primary URI for Civic Mapping Service

   This purpose=10 URI gives the client the ability to transmit its 
   location, perhaps downloaded from the civic format DHCP Option [ID-
   CIVIC], and contact a "primary" server at this URI to perform a 
   location-to-PSAP-URI mapping function before the client attempts to 
   contact a PSAP.  

   This transmission of client location to the primary mapping server 
   that includes the request to map this location to the appropriate 
   PSAP for that location is done with another protocol, and not DHCP.


3.11 Secondary URI for Civic Mapping Service

   This purpose=11 URI gives the client the ability to transmit its 
   location, perhaps downloaded from the civic format DHCP Option [ID-
   CIVIC], and contact a "secondary" server at this URI to perform a 
   location-to-PSAP-URI mapping function before the client attempts to 
   contact a PSAP.  

   This transmission of client location to the secondary mapping server
   that includes the request to map this location to the appropriate 
   PSAP for that location is done with another protocol, and not DHCP.


4.  Open Items for Discussion

   There are several open items that need to be addressed in following 
   versions of this ID (if it moves forward).

   #1 - There is an open question as to whether a URI will ever need to
        be longer than 255 bytes (getting into concatenation-required

        language)


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned a DHCP option code of [XXX] for the URI option
   defined in this document.

   This URI Option defines one field for which IANA maintains a 
   registry: the Purpose field (see Section 2).  The initial values of 
   the Purpose registry are as follows:

   Purpose   Description                                Reference
   -------   ------------                               ---------
      1      Primary PSAP URI                           [This RFC]
      2      Secondary PSAP URI                         [This RFC]
      3      Location By-Reference URI of Client        [This RFC]
      4      ESGW URI of Client                         [This RFC]
      5      ESRP URI of Client                         [This RFC]
      6      Organization Providing Location for Client [This RFC]
      7      URI of Geocoding/Reverse Geocoding         [This RFC]
      8      Primary URI of Geo Mapping Service         [This RFC]
      9      Secondary URI of Geo Mapping Service       [This RFC]
      10     Primary URI of Civic Mapping Service       [This RFC]
      11     Secondary URI of Civic Mapping Service     [This RFC]


   IANA registration of new purpose field values MUST be done in a 
   standards track RFC. 


6.  Security Considerations

   Where critical decisions might be based on the value of this URI
   option, DHCP authentication in [RFC3118] SHOULD be used to protect 
   the integrity of the DHCP options.

   Since there is no privacy protection for DHCP messages, an
   eavesdropper who can monitor the link between the client and
   destination DHCP server to capture any URIs in transit.

   When implementing a DHC server that will serve clients across an
   uncontrolled network, one should consider the potential security
   risks.

   There is a risk of old information being provided by this Option.  
   Although many wish the Internet to be truly dynamic in its updates 
   to topology changes (for whatever reason), this does not always 
   happen as planned.  Careful consideration needs to be taken in this 
   Option to have some way of leaving a trail of breadcrumbs to find 
   where a problem is related to this Option.  URI Option #6 could 
   become a more universal Option in this regard to provide who it was 


Polk                       Expires March, 2006                [Page 12]
Internet-Draft               DHC URI Option                   Sept 2005

   that provided a certain critical piece of information that ended up 
   needing an update.
