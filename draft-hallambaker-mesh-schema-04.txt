            Mathematical Mesh 3.0 Part IV: Schema Reference
                    draft-hallambaker-mesh-schema-04

Abstract

   The Mathematical Mesh 'The Mesh' is an end-to-end secure
   infrastructure that facilitates the exchange of configuration and
   credential data between multiple user devices.  The core protocols of
   the Mesh are described with examples of common use cases and
   reference data.

Internet-Draft            Mesh Schema Reference             October 2019


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the data structures of the Mathematical Mesh
   with illustrative examples.  For an overview of the Mesh objectives
   and architecture, consult the accompanying Architecture Guide
   [draft-hallambaker-mesh-architecture] . For information on the
   implementation of the Mesh Service protocol, consult the accompanying
   Protocol Reference [draft-hallambaker-mesh-protocol]

   This document has two main sections.  The first section presents
   examples of the Mesh assertions, catalog entry and messages in use.
   The second section contains the schema reference.  All the material
   in both sections is generated from the Mesh reference implementation
   [draft-hallambaker-mesh-developer] .

   Although some of the services described in this document could be
   used to replace existing Internet protocols including FTP and SMTP,
   the principal value of any communication protocol lies in the size of
   the audience it allows them to communicate with.  Thus, while the
   Mesh Messaging service is designed to support efficient and reliable
   transfer of messages ranging in size from a few bytes to multiple
   terabytes, the near-term applications of these services will be to
   applications that are not adequately supported by existing protocols
   if at all.

2.  Definitions

   This section presents the related specifications and standard, the
   terms that are used as terms of art within the documents and the
   terms used as requirements language.

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] .

2.2.  Defined Terms

   The terms of art used in this document are described in the Mesh
   Architecture Guide [draft-hallambaker-mesh-architecture] .

2.3.  Related Specifications

   The architecture of the Mathematical Mesh is described in the Mesh
   Architecture Guide [draft-hallambaker-mesh-architecture] . The Mesh
   documentation set and related specifications are described in this
   document.

2.4.  Implementation Status

   The implementation status of the reference code base is described in
   the companion document [draft-hallambaker-mesh-developer] .

3.  Mesh Assertions

   Mesh Assertions are signed DARE Envelopes that contain one of more
   claims.  Mesh Assertions provide the basis for trust in the
   Mathematical Mesh.

   Mesh Assertions are divided into two classes.  Mesh Profiles are
   self-signed assertions.  Assertions that are not self-signed are
   called declarations.  The only type of declaration currently defined
   is a Connection Declaration describing the connection of one profile
   to another.  Currently, five profile and four connection types are
   defined:

   schema.html [2].]]


   Profiles And Connections

3.1.  Encoding

   The payload of a Mesh Assertion is a JSON encoded object that is a
   subclass of the Assertion class which defines the following fields:

   Identifier  An identifier for the assertion.

   Updated  The date and time at which the assertion was issued or last
      updated

   NotaryToken  An assertion may optionally contain one or more notary
      tokens issued by a Mesh Notary service.  These establish a proof
      that the assertion was signed after the date the notary token was
      created.

   Conditions  A list of conditions that MAY be used to verify the
      status of the assertion if the relying party requires.

   The implementation of the NotaryToken and Conditions mechanisms is to
   be specified in [draft-hallambaker-mesh-notary] at a future date.

   Note that the implementation of Conditions differs significantly from
   that of SAML.  Relying parties are required to process condition

   clauses in a SAML assertion to determine validity.  Mesh Relying
   parties MAY verify the conditions clauses or rely on the
   trustworthiness of the provider.

   The reason for weakening the processing of conditions clauses in the
   Mesh is that it is only ever possible to validate a conditions clause
   of any type relative to a ground truth.  In SAML applications, the
   relying party almost invariably has access to an independent source
   of ground truth.  A Mesh device connected to a Mesh Service does not.
   Thus the types of verification that can be achieved in practice are
   limited to verifying the consistency of current and previous
   statements from the Mesh Service.

3.2.  Mesh Profiles

   Mesh Profiles perform a similar role to X.509v3 certificates but with
   important differences:

   o  Profiles describe credentials, they do not make identity
      statements

   o  Profiles do not expire, there is therefore no need to support
      renewal processing.

   o  Profiles may be modified over time, the current and past status of
      a profile being recorded in an append only log.

   Profiles provide the axioms of trust for the Mesh PKI.  Unlike in the
   PKIX model in which all trust flows from axioms of trust held by a
   small number of Certificate Authorities, every part in the Mesh
   contributes their own axiom of trust.

   It should be noted however that the role of Certificate Authorities
   is redefined rather than eliminated.  Rather than making assertions
   whose subject is represented by identities which are inherently
   mutable and subjective, Certificate Authorities can now make
   assertions about immutable cryptographic keys.

   Every Profile MUST contain a SignatureKey field and MUST be signed by
   the key specified in that field.

   A Profile is valid if and only if:

   o  There is a SignatureKey field.

   o  The profile is signed under the key specified in the SignatureKey
      field.

Internet-Draft            Mesh Schema Reference             October 2019


   A profile has the status current if and only if:

   o  The Profile is valid

   o  Every Conditions clause in the profile is understood by the
      relying party and evaluates to true.

3.3.  Mesh Connections

3.4.  Mesh Private Declarations

4.  Architecture

   The Mesh architecture has four principal components:

   Mesh Device Management  Binds a collection of devices that the owner
      of the Mesh uses together to function as a single personal Mesh.

   Mesh Account  Contains all the information (contacts, calendar
      entries, inbound and outbound messages, etc.) related to a
      particular persona used by the owner.

   Mesh Service  Provides a service identifier (e.g. alice@example.com)
      through which devices and other Mesh users may interact with a
      Mesh Account.

   Mesh Messaging

   Allows short messages (less than 32KB) to be exchanged between Mesh
   devices connected to an account and between Mesh Accounts.

   Device management and Accounts components are defined by a data
   schema alone.  The Service and Messaging components are defined by a
   data schema and a service protocol.

   The separation of accounts and services as separate components is a
   key distinction between the Mesh and earlier Internet applications.
   A Mesh account belongs to the owner of the Mesh and not the account
   service provider which the user may change at any time of their
   choosing.  A Mesh account may be connected to multiple service
   providers to provide backup capability or to none.

   For example, Alice's personal Mesh has one Master Profile, multiple
   device profiles (two of which are shown here) and two Account
   Profiles.  Her Personal account is connected to two Mesh services
   while her Business account is not currently connected to any service:

   Alice's Personal Mesh

   In normal circumstances, a user will create a personal Mesh and add
   their first device, account and service at once.  These are shown
   here as separate operations to illustrate the separation of the Mesh
   components.

4.1.  Device Management

   Device Management provides the foundation for all Mesh functions
   allowing a collection of devices belonging to a user to function as a
   single personal Mesh.

   The device management layer of a personal Mesh consists of exactly
   one Master Profile and a catalog containing the entries describing
   the connected devices.

4.1.1.  Master Profile

   A Mesh master profile provides the axiom of trust for a mesh user.
   It contains a Master Signature Key and one or more Administration
   Signature Keys.  The unique identifier of the master profile is the
   UDF of the Master Signature Key.

   A Master Profile MAY contain one or more MasterEscrowKeys.  These MAY
   be used to escrow private keys used for encryption.  They SHOULD NOT
   be used to escrow authentication keys and MUST NOT be used to escrow
   signature keys.

   Master Profile and Associated Device and Account Connection
   Assertions.

   A user should not need to replace their master profile unless they
   intend to establish a separate identity.  To minimize the risk of
   disclosure, the Master Signature Key is only ever used to sign
   updates to the master profile itself.  This allows the user to secure
   their Master Signature Key by either keeping it on hardware token or

   device dedicated to that purpose or by using the escrow mechanism and

   Alice creates a ProfileMaster with one administration key and one
   master escrow key:

4.1.1.1.  Creating a ProfileMaster

   Creating a ProfileMaster comprises the steps of:

   1.  Creating a Master Signature key.

   2.  Creating an Online Signing Key

   3.  Signing the ProfileMaster using the Master Signature Key

   4.  Persisting the ProfileMaster on the administration device to the
       CatalogHost.

   5.  (Optional) Connecting at least one Administration Device and
       granting it the ActivationAdministration activation.

4.1.1.2.  Updating a ProfileMaster

   Updating a ProfileMaster comprises the steps of:

   1.  Making the necessary changes.

   2.  Signing the ProfileMaster using the Master Signature Key

   3.  Persisting the ProfileMaster on the administration device to the
       CatalogHost.

4.1.1.3.  The Device Catalog

   Each personal Mesh has a Device Catalog CatalogDevice associated with
   it.  The Device Catalog is used to manage the connection of devices
   to the Personal Mesh and has a CatalogEntryDevice for each device
   currently connected to the catalog.

   Each Administration Device MUST have access to an up to date copy of
   the Device Catalog in order to manage the devices connected to the
   Mesh.  The Mesh Service protocol MAY be used to synchronize the
   Device Catalog between administration devices in the case that there
   is more than one administration device.

   The CatalogEntryDevice contains fields for the device profile, device
   private and device connection.

4.1.2.  Mesh Devices

   The principle of radical distrust requires us to consider the
   possibility that a device might be compromised during manufacture.
   Once consequence of this possibility is that when an administration
   device connects a new device to a user's personal Mesh, we cannot put
   our full trust in either the device being connected or the
   administration device connecting it.

   This concern is resolved by (at minimum) combining keying material
   generated from both sources to create the keys to be used in the
   context of the user's personal Mesh with the process being fully
   verified by both parties.

   Additional keying material sources could be added if protection
   against the possibility of compromise at both devices was required
   but this is not supported by the current specifications.

   A device profile provides the axiom of trust and the key
   contributions of the device:

   Mapping of Device Profile and Device Private to Device Connection
   Keys.

   Unless exceptional circumstances require, a device should not require
   more than one Device profile even if the device supports use by
   multiple users under different accounts.  But a device MAY have
   multiple profiles if this approach is more convenient for
   implementation.

   Alice's Device Profile specifies keys for encryption, signature and
   exchange:

   {
     "ProfileDevice":{
       "KeyOfflineSignature":{
         "UDF":"MADC-EAFQ-SWVC-LZLN-OX3C-ZETW-OKBC",

         "PublicParameters":{

     qJ7FRpyX6dv6n2zxzZ4JhWnkQxruA"}}}}}

   Since the Device Profile keys are ultimately under the control of the
   device and/or software provider, these are considered insufficiently
   trustworthy and the administration device creates key contributions
   to be added to the device keys to establish the key set to be used in
   the context of the user's personal Mesh:

   The derivation of the Connection encryption and signature keys from
   the Profile and Private contributions in this example is shown in

4.1.2.1.  Creating a ProfileDevice

   Creating a ProfileDevice comprises the steps of:

   1.  Creating the necessary key

   2.  Signing the ProfileDevice using the Master Signature Key

Internet-Draft            Mesh Schema Reference             October 2019


   3.  Once created, a ProfileDevice is never changed.  In the unlikely
       event that any modification is required, a completely new
       ProfileDevice MUST be created.

4.1.2.2.  Connection to a Personal Mesh

   Devices are only connected to a personal Mesh by administration
   device.  This comprises the steps of:

   1.  Generating the PrivateDevice keys.

   2.  Creating the ConnectionDevice data from the public components of
       the ProfileDevice and PrivateDevice keys and signing it using the
       administration key.

   3.  Creating the Activations for the device and signing them using
       the administration key.

   4.  Creating the CatalogEntryDevice for the device and adding it to
       the CatalogDevice of the Personal Mesh.

   5.  If the Personal Mesh has accounts that are connected to a Mesh
       Service, synchronizing the CatalogEntryDevice to those services.

4.2.  Mesh Accounts

   Mesh Accounts contains all the stateful information (contacts,
   calendar entries, inbound and outbound messages, etc.) related to a
   particular persona used by the owner.

   A Mesh Profile MAY be connected to multiple accounts at the same time
   allowing the user to maintain separate personas for separate
   purposes.

   Unlike traditional Internet application accounts, Mesh accounts are
   created by and belong to the user, not the Mesh Service provider.  A
   user MAY change their Mesh Service provider at any time and
   disconnect the profile from all Mesh Services (e.g. to archive the
   account).

   Alice's personal account is connected to two Mesh services:

   3.  Creating an ActivationAccount for the device containing the
       PrivateAccount and ConnectionAccountDevice instances.

   4.  Adding the ActivationAccount to the CatalogEntryDevice of the
       device.

   5.  If the Personal Mesh has accounts that are connected to a Mesh
       Service, synchronizing the CatalogEntryDevice to those services.

4.2.3.  Binding and Account to a Service

   Binding a ProfileAccount to a Mesh Service the steps of:

   1.  [TBS]

   2.  .

   3.  Signing the ProfileMaster using the Master Signature Key

4.3.  Mesh Services

   A service profile provides the axiom of trust and cryptographic keys
   for a Mesh Service.  A Mesh Service Host SHOULD return a copy of its
   ProfileHost and the parent ProfileService in response to a Hello
   transaction request.

   [[This figure is not viewable in this format.  The figure is
   available at http://mathmesh.com/Documents/draft-hallambaker-mesh-
   schema.html [7].]]


   Service Profile and Delegated Host Assertion.

   The credentials provided by the ProfileService and ProfileHost are
   distinct from those provided by the WebPKI that typically services
   TLS requests.  WebPKI credentials provide service introduction and
   authentication while a Mesh ProfileHost only provides authentication.

   Unless exceptional circumstances require, a service should not need
   to revise its Service Profile unless it is intended to change its
   identity.  Service Profiles MAY be countersigned by Trusted Third
   Parties to establish accountability.

   The service profile

4.4.  Mesh Messaging

   Mesh Messaging is an end-to-end secure messaging system used to
   exchange short (32KB) messages between Mesh devices and services.  In
   cases where exchange of longer messages is required, Mesh Messaging
   MAY be used to provide a control plane to advise the intended message
   recipient(s) of the type of data being offered and the means of
   retrieval (e.g an EARL).

   A four-corner messaging model is enforced.  Mesh Services only accept
   outbound messages from devices connected to accounts that it
   services.  Inbound messages are only accepted from other Mesh
   Services.  This model enables access control at both the outbound and
   inbound services

   schema.html [8].]]


   Performing Access Control on Outbound Messages

   The outbound Mesh Service checks to see that the message request does
   not violate its acceptable use policy.  Accounts that make a large
   number of message requests that result in complaints SHOULD be
   subject to consequences ranging from restriction of the number and
   type of messages sent to suspending or terminating messaging
   privileges.

   Performing Access Control on Outbound Messages

   The inbound Mesh Service also checks to see that messages received
   are consistent with the service Acceptable Use Policy and the user's
   personal access control settings.

   Mesh Services that fail to police abuse by their account holders
   SHOULD be subject to consequences in the same fashion as account
   holders.

4.4.1.  Traffic Analysis

   The Mesh Messaging protocol as currently specified provides only
   limited protection against traffic analysis attacks.  The use of TLS
   to encrypt communication between Mesh Services limits the
   effectiveness of na?ve traffic analysis mechanisms but does not
   prevent timing attacks unless dummy traffic is introduced to
   obfuscate traffic flows.

   The limitation of the message size is in part intended to facilitate
   use of mechanisms capable of providing high levels of traffic
   analysis such as mixmaster and onion routing but the current Mesh

   Service Protocol does not provide support for such approaches and
   there are no immediate plans to do so.

5.  Mesh Catalogs

   Catalogs track sets of persistent objects associated with a Mesh
   Service Account.  The Mesh Service has no access to the entries in
   any Mesh catalog except for the Device and Contacts catalog which are
   used in device authentication and authorization of inbound messages.

   Each Mesh Catalog managed by a Mesh Account has a name of the form:

   <<prefix>_<name>

   Where <<prefix> is the IANA assigned service name.  The assigned
   service name for the Mathematical Mesh is mmm.  Thus, all catalogs
   specified by the Mesh schema have names prefixed with the sequence
   mmm_.

   The following catalogs are currently specified within the
   Mathematical Mesh.

   Application: mmm_CatalogApplication  Contains configuration
      information for applications including mail (SMTP, IMAP, OpenPGP,
      S/MIME, etc) and SSH and for the MeshAccount application itself.

   Device: mmm_CatalogDevice  Contains descriptions of devices connected
      to the account and the permissions assigned to them

   Contact: mmm_CatalogContact  Contains logical and physical contact
      information for people and organizations.

   Credential: mmm_CatalogCredential  Contains credentials used to
      access network resources.

   Bookmark: mmm_CatalogBookmark  Contains Web bookmarks and other
      citations allowing them to be shared between devices connected to
      the profile.

   Task: mmm_CatalogTask  Contains tasks assigned to the user including
      calendar entries and to do lists.

   Network: mmm_CatalogNetwork  Contains network settings such as WiFi
      access points, IPSEC and TLS VPN configurations, etc.

   In many cases, the Mesh Catalog offers capabilities that represent a
   superset of the capabilities of an existing application.  For
   example, the task catalog supports the appointment tracking functions



Hallam-Baker             Expires April 25, 2020                [Page 26]

Internet-Draft            Mesh Schema Reference             October 2019


   of a traditional calendar application and the task tracking function
   of the traditional 'to do list' application.  Combining these
   functions allows tasks to be triggered by other events other than the
   passage of time such as completion of other tasks, geographical
   presence, etc.

   In such cases, the Mesh Catalog entries are designed to provide a
   superset of the data representation capabilities of the legacy
   formats and (where available) recent extensions.  Where a catalog
   entry is derived from input presented in a legacy format, the
   original data representation MAY be attached verbatim to facilitate
   interoperability.

5.1.  Application

   The application catalog mmm_CatalogApplication contains
   CatalogEntryApplication entries which describe the use of specific
   applications under the Mesh Service Account.  Multiple application
   accounts for a single application MAY be connected to a single Mesh
   Service Account.  Each account being specified in a separate entry.

   The CatalogEntryApplication entries only contain configuration
   information for the application as it applies to the account as a
   whole.  If the application requires separate configuration for
   individual devices, this is specified in separate activation records
   specified in the corresponding ConnectionDevice.

5.1.1.  Mesh Account

   Mesh Accounts are described by CatalogEntryAccount entries.  The
   corresponding activation records for the connected devices contain
   the contributions used to derive the private keys for use of the
   account.

   The CatalogEntryAccount entry is described in the section describing
   Mesh accounts above.

5.1.2.  SSH

   SSH configuration profiles are described by
   CatalogEntryApplicationSSH entries.  The corresponding activation
   records for the connected devices contain the contributions used to
   derive the private keys.

   A user may have separate SSH configurations for separate purposes
   within a single Mesh Account.  This allows a system administrator
   servicing multiple clients to maintain separate SSH profiles for each

   revoked at contract termination.

   The SSH profile contains the information that is stored in the
   known_hosts and authorized_keys files of SSH clients and servers.

5.1.3.  Mail

   Mail configuration profiles are described by one or more
   CatalogEntryApplicationMail entries, one for each email account
   connected to the Mesh profile.  The corresponding activation records
   for the connected devices contain information used to provide the
   device with the necessary decryption information.

   Entries specify the email account address(es), the inbound and
   outbound server configuration and the cryptographic keys to be used
   for S/MIME and OpenPGP encryption.

   $$$$ Empty $$$$

5.2.  Device

   The device catalog mmm_CatalogDevice contains CatalogEntryDevice
   entries which describe the devices connected to the account and the
   permissions assigned to them.

   The management of the device catalog is described in the section
   describing Mesh Device Management.

5.3.  Contact

   The contacts catalog contains CatalogEntryContact entries which
   describe

   $$$$ Empty $$$$

   The fields of the contact catalog provide a superset of the
   capabilities of vCard [RFC2426] .

   The Contact catalog is typically used by the MeshService as a source
   of authorization information to perform access control on inbound and
   outbound message requests.  For this reason, Mesh Service SHOULD be
   granted read access to the contacts catalog by providing a decryption
   entry for the service.

5.4.  Credential

   The credential catalog contains CatalogEntryCredential entries which
   describe credentials used to access network resources.

      Only username/password credentials are stored in the credential
      catalog.  If public key credentials are to be used, these SHOULD
      be managed as an application profile allowing separate credentials
      to be created for each device.

       "Service":"ftp.example.com",
       "Username":"alice1",

5.5.  Bookmark

   The bookmark catalog contains CatalogEntryBookmark entries which
   describe Web bookmarks and other citations allowing them to be shared
   between devices connected to the profile.

   The fields currently supported by the Bookmarks catalog are currently
   limited to the fields required for tracking Web bookmarks.
   Specification of additional fields to track full academic citations
   is a work in progress.

     "CatalogedBookmark":{
       "Uri":"http://example.net/Bananas",
       "Title":"\"Banana",

5.6.  Task

   The Task catalog contains CatalogEntryTask entries which describe
   tasks assigned to the user including calendar entries and to do
   lists.

   The fields of the task catalog currently reflect those offered by the
   iCalendar specification [RFC5545] . Specification of additional
   fields to allow task triggering on geographic location and/or
   completion of other tasks is a work in progress.

6.  Mesh Messages

   All communications between Mesh accounts takes the form of a Mesh
   Message carried in a Dare Envelope.  Mesh Messages are stored in two
   spools associated with the account, the SpoolOutbound and the
   SpoolInbound containing the messages sent and received respectively.

   This document only describes the representation of the messages
   within the message spool.  The Mesh Service protocol by which the
   messages are exchanged between devices and services and between
   services is described in [draft-hallambaker-mesh-protocol] .

6.1.  Completion

   Completion messages are dummy messages that are added to a Mesh Spool
   to change the status of messages previously posted.  Any message that
   is in the inbound spool and has not been erased or redacted MAY be
   marked as read, unread or deleted.  Any message in the outbound spool
   MAY be marked as sent, received or deleted.

   Services MAY erase or redact messages in accordance with local site
   policy.  Since messages are not removed from the spool on being
   marked deleted, they may be undeleted by marking them as read or
   unread.  Marking a message deleted MAY make it more likely that the
   Service will purge the message however.

   Having processed a message, a completion message is added to the
   spool so that other devices can see that it has been read:

   [NYI]

6.2.  Connection

   Connection requests are sent by a device requesting connection to a
   Mesh Service Account.

   The MessageConnectionRequest is originally sent by the device
   requesting connection to the Mesh Service associated with the
   account.





Hallam-Baker             Expires April 25, 2020                [Page 30]

Internet-Draft            Mesh Schema Reference             October 2019


   If the connection request is accepted by the Mesh Service, it creates
   a MessageConnectionResponse containing the ServerNonce and Witness
   values used in the authentication of the response together with a
   verbatim copy of the original request.  The MessageConnectionResponse
   is then returned to the device that made the original request and
   placed on the SpoolInbound of the account to which the request was
   directed.

   Further details of this mechanism are described in
   [draft-hallambaker-mesh-protocol] .

   The connection process begins with the assignment of a time-limited
   PIN value.  This is described in a Message sent by the administration
   device to allow other admin devices to accept the request made.

   [NYI]

   The initial request is sent to the service

   [NYI]

   The service returns an acknowledgement giving the Witness value.
   Note that this is not a 'reply' since it comes from the service, not
   the user.

   [NYI]

   [Note, this mechanism should be revised to ensure that there is
   perfect forward secrecy.  The device should provide a nonce key as a
   mixin]

6.3.  Contact

   A contact request presents a proposed contact entry and requests that
   it be added to the Contacts catalog of the specified Mesh Service
   Account.  A contact request is usually sent by the party requesting
   that their contact be added but this is not necessarily the case.

   The MessageContact contains a DARE Envelope containing the Contact
   information of the requester.  If the request is accepted, this
   information will be added to the contact catalog of the relevant
   account.  If the Reply field has the value 'true', this indicates
   that the sender is asking for the recipient to return their own
   credentials in reply.

   Since the sender requires the user's contact information before the
   request can be made, the MessageContact message MAY be encrypted
   under either the user's account encryption key (if known) or the Mesh

   Service encryption key (which may be obtained from the service on
   request.

   Bob asks Alice to send her contact details and sends his.

   [NYI]

   Alice responds with her details:

   [NYI]

   [Note that this exchange could be performed automatically on Alice's
   behalf by the service if she delegates this action to it.]

   The current protocol assumes that all contact management will be
   performed end-to-end through the Mesh Services themselves.  If the
   number of Mesh users were to become very large, additional
   infrastructure to facilitate contact management will be required.
   These topics are discussed at a high level in
   [draft-hallambaker-mesh-trust] .

   In situations where a user is well known and has a very large number
   of contacts, they are likely to make use of a tiered approach to
   contact management in which they keep separate accounts for their
   'public' and 'restricted' personas and delegate management of their
   public account to a subordinate or to their Mesh Service provider.

6.4.  Confirmation

   Confirmation messages are used to provide an improved form of second
   factor authentication capability.

   Two confirmation messages are specified, a request and response.

   A confirmation request is initiated by sending a
   MessageConfirmationRequest to the Mesh Service hosting the recipient
   Mesh Service Account.  The request specifies the question that is to
   be put to the user.

   To respond to a confirmation request, a user generates a
   MessageConfirmationResponse.  This MUST be signed by a device
   authorized to respond to confirmation requests by a Device Connection
   Assertion with the Confirmation privilege.

   The confirmation request

11.  Appendix A: Example Container Organization (not normative)

   The means by which profiles are stored on devices is outside the
   scope of the specification.  Only catalogs that are required to be
   shared between machines by means of accounts need to be standardized.

11.1.  Device

   Host Catalog: Host.dare  Catalog of all the Mesh Profiles that the
      user has registered with the device and the latest version of the
      device profile for this device.

   MeshCatalog: [UDF-Mesh].dcat  Catalog containing the Account Entries
      for the Mesh [UDF-Mesh].

   Account Catalogs: [UDF-Account]/mmm_Device.dcat  The device catalog
      associated with the specified account

   Account Catalogs: [UDF-Account]/[Catalog name].dcat  The set of
      account catalogs that are shared verbatim between the devices
      connected to the account.

11.1.1.  Creating a new Mesh

   Create new Mesh Profile, Device Profile, Add to Host Catalog

   Create MeshCatalog
