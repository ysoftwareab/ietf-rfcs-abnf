1.  Abstract
    
    Storing URLs [URL] for later access has become common in Internet
    applications (for example, web browsers, FTP clients); these saved
    URLs have become known as bookmarks.  It would be desirable to
    access one's bookmarks from multiple clients and multiple machines.
    
    The Application Configuration Access Protocol [ACAP] provides an
    ideal mechanism for storage of bookmarks, providing for ease of
    coordination and synchronization of bookmarks between diverse
    applications and systems, as well as for hierarchy, inheritance, and
    sharing.
    
    This specification defines a standard ACAP dataset class for
    bookmarks.
    
    
2.  Conventions Used in this Document
    
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY"
    in this document are to be interpreted as defined in "Key words for
    use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [KEYWORDS].
    
    
3.  ACAP Bookmarks Dataset Class
    
    The ACAP Bookmarks dataset class defines a set of attributes for
    each bookmark, and provides for bookmark inheritance and hierarchy.
    
    
3.1.  ACAP Bookmarks Dataset Class Prefix
    




Gellens                    Expires June 1999                    [Page 2]Internet Draft        ACAP Bookmarks Dataset Class        December 1998

    Datasets whose names begin with "/bookmarks" are assumed to contain
    bookmark entries as defined in this specification.
    
    
3.2.  ACAP Bookmarks Dataset Hierarchy
    
    Each user may have a hierarchical set of bookmarks.  Nested or
    hierarchical bookmarks (that is, bookmark folders) SHOULD be
    represented using the ACAP Hierarchy.  Any entry in a bookmarks
    dataset can be a hierarchy node by setting the "subdataset"
    attribute.
    
    Inheritance is likely to be useful both for inheriting sets of site
    or group default bookmarks as well as for inheriting user-specific
    bookmarks when using different machines.
    
    
4.  Recommended ACAP Bookmarks Dataset Attributes
    
    A Bookmarks dataset entry MUST have an "entry" attribute.  All other
    attributes are OPTIONAL.
    
    Attributes are specified using Augmented Backus-Naur Form [ABNF].
    All attributes are single-valued and textual unless otherwise
    stated.
    
    The ABNF defines the content of the attribute values prior to their
    encoding as an ACAP string.  Clients MUST conform to the syntax when
    generating these attributes, but MUST NOT assume that the attribute
    values will conform to this syntax on access.  Servers MUST NOT
    enforce the syntax.
    
    
4.1.  Basic Attributes
    
    These attributes are defined in ACAP [ACAP] and have meaning in all
    dataset classes.  The section describes how they are used in a
    bookmarks dataset.
    
    entry
        The "entry" attribute is used to hold a unique name for the
        bookmark.  The name MUST be unique, but is not expected to be
        descriptive, and may not be suitable for display to users.  It
        is client-defined.
        
    subdataset
        The "subdataset" attribute indicates there is another bookmark
        dataset underneath this entry.

4.2.  Specific Attributes
    
    These attributes are specific to the Bookmarks dataset class.
    
    bookmarks.Date.Added
        This contains the date and time of the original creation of this
        entry.  The value is expressed in UTC with a timezone offset,
        indicating the user's local time.
        
        book-date           = datetime ;specified in Common ABNF
        
    bookmarks.Description
        This contains the user-assigned description of the entry, as a
        series of CRLF-separated lines.
        
        book-description    = *line ;specified in Common ABNF
        
    bookmarks.Last.Modified
        This contains the date and time of the most recent modification
        of the entry.  Modification includes any user-initiated action
        (such as editing the description) but not automatic actions
        (such as updating the "Last.Visited" attribute).  The value is
        expressed in UTC, with a timezone offset indicating the user's
        local time.
        
        book-modtime        = datetime ;specified in Common ABNF
        
    bookmarks.Last.Visited
        This contains the date and time of the most recent access of the
        location represented by the entry's URL.  The value is expressed
        in UTC, with a timezone offset indicating the user's local time.
        
        book-visit          = datetime ;specified in Common ABNF
        
    bookmarks.Name
        This specifies a descriptive name for the entry.  It does not
        need to be unique.
        
        book-name           = 1*(VCHAR / SP)
        
    bookmarks.Type
        This contains a token describing the type of the entry.  The
        Separator type indicates the entry is separator for display
        purposes.  The Folder type is used for a container or folder
        (used with ACAP subdatasets).  The Alias type is used for an
        alias entry, in which case the URL is an ACAP URL to an entry in
        an ACAP Bookmarks dataset.  The Link type is used to refer to
        any type of object, for example, a web page or a file.
        
        book-type           = "separator" / "link" / "alias" / "folder"

    bookmarks.URL
        This contains the URL of the object referred to by this entry.
        For Link type entries, this can be any type of URL.  For Alias
        type entries, this is an ACAP URL.  ACAP URLs are specified in
        [ACAP].
        
        book-url            = url ;defined in [URL]
        
        
5.  Common ABNF
    
    The following [ABNF] rules are used above.
    
        datetime    =   year month day hour minute second timezone 
                        ;UTC and offset to local time
        
        day         =   2DIGIT
        
        hour        =   2DIGIT
        
        line        =   *(VCHAR / SP) CRLF
        
        minute      =   2DIGIT
        
        month       =   2DIGIT
        
        second      =   2DIGIT
        
        timezone    =   ("+" / "-") 4DIGIT
        
        year        =   4DIGIT

8.  Security Considerations
    
    As with ACAP datasets in general, it is important that access
    controls are set correctly on Bookmarks datasets.  Attributes may
    contain personal information which should not be disclosed except by
    explicit owner request.
