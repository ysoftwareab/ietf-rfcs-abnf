Internet-Draft  OMA BCAST MIKEY General Extension Payload       Sep 2006


1.  Introduction

   The Multimedia Internet Keying (MIKEY) protocol specification [1]
   defines a General Extension payload to allow possible extensions to
   MIKEY without having to define new payloads.  The General Extension
   payload can be used in any MIKEY message and is part of the
   authenticated/signed data part.  There is an 8-bit type field in that
   payload and the type code assignment is IANA managed and RFC 3830
   requires IETF consensus for assignments from the public range of
   0-240.

   The Open Mobile Alliance's (OMA) Browser and Content (BAC) Broadcast
   (BCAST) group's Service and Content Protection specification [2]
   specifies the use of a short term key message (STKM) and a long term
   key message (LTKM) that carry attributes related to service and
   content protection.  Note that any keys associated with the
   attributes are part of the MIKEY KEMAC payload.  This document
   specifies the use of the General Extension payload of MIKEY to carry
   the LTKMs or STKMs.

   RFC 3830, the MIKEY General Extension payload defined in [3] along
   with the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)'s Multimedia
   Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS) [4] document specify the transport
   of MIKEY messages via unicast or broadcast and the OMA specifications
   use either for transport of MIKEY messages.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [5].

      OMA BCAST MIKEY General Extension payload: We refer to the General
      Extension payload type -- value, to be assigned by IANA -- as the
      OMA BCAST MIKEY General Extension payload.

            Figure 1: OMA BCAST MIKEY General Extension Payload

   Section 6.1 of RFC 3830 specifies the first three fields of the
   General Extension Payload and defines a variable length Data field.
   This document specifies the use of Type XX [To be filled in by the
   RFC Editor after IANA assignment] for OMA BCAST Service and Content
   Protection using the Smartcard Profile.  The contents of the variable
   length data field are neither defined nor constrained by any IETF
   specification other than those captured in the Security
   Considerations section of this document.  They are specified in the
   OMA BCAST Service and Content Protection specification [2].


4.  Interoperability considerations

   This document specifies the use of MIKEY General Extension Payload
   Type XX [to be assigned by IANA based on IETF review] for OMA BCAST
   service and content protection using the Smartcard profile.
   Interoperability considerations span several standards bodies, with
   OMA BCAST 1.0 enabler compliance being the key aspect; as such it is
   up to the OMA test planning to verify the interoperability and
   compliance of OMA BCAST 1.0 implementations.  This payload type
   assignment does not change MIKEY beyond RFC 3830 and [3].


5.  Security Considerations

   According to RFC 3830, the general extension payload can be used in
   any MIKEY message and is part of the authenticated/signed data part.
   The parameters proposed to be included in the OMA BCAST MIKEY General
   Extension payload (listed in Section 3) need only to be integrity
   protected, which is already allowed by the MIKEY specification.  The
   OMA BCAST MIKEY General Extension Payload SHALL be integrity
   protected.  Furthermore, keys or any parameters that require
   confidentiality MUST NOT be included in the General Extension
   Payload.  If keys or other confidential data are to be transported
   via this General Extension Payload, they must be protected in place.
   Finally, note that MIKEY already provides replay protection and that
   protection covers the General Extension Payload also.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a new General Extension Type from the
   "General Extensions payload name spaces" in the IANA registry at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/mikey-payloads for use by OMA BCAST.
