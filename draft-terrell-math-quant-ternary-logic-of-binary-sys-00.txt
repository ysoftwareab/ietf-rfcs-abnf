Abstract


   This paper provides the final clarification simplifying the
   Mathematical proof for the New Binary System, by proving that
   the mathematical operations defined in the Current Binary System
   are wrong. In other words, using an askew, or mathematically
   incorrect Binary System, which pertains to the misinterpretation
   of ZERO, resulted in a substantial loss of available IP
   Addresses in the IPv4 IP Specification.





Introduction


   The investigation of the origin of the Binary System revealed
   that Leibniz, its principle author, is responsible for the
   askew error, because he never understood or actually developed
   a Binary System of counting. And this is clearly shown to be
   the handicap that not only resulted in the Loss of available
   IP Addresses in the IPv4 Specification, but it contributed to
   the difficulties preventing the development of the Binary and
   Ternary Relations defined by Boolean Algebra. That is, by
   clearly showing that this is a Closed Finite Mathematical
   System, which defines an incremental progression using ' 1's '.
   This greatly simplified the Boolean Mathematical Relationships
   for the ‘Theory of Three State Logic’, and corrected the error
   in Binary Enumeration, which generated the loss of IP Addresses
   in the IPv4 Specification. In other words, the proof of
   “Fermat’s Last Theorem” defines a special case of the
   Distributive Law, which is defined in the mathematical logic
   of Set Theory, as the Intersection of the two Universal Sets
   that represents the Binary and the Unary Systems. And this
   conclusively proves, that there are only Two logical
   Systems of Counting, which are mathematically viable.

1.  The Beginnings of Binary Enumeration




   The History of the Binary System has its recorded beginnings
   starting about the 5th century BC. But, there is a problem with
   this recorded date, because the historians have not defined, or
   established an agreement regarding what they mean jointly, or
   independently, when they are referencing the development of the
   Binary System. In other words, for many people, specifically
   mathematicians, when they speak or make reference to the Binary
   System, they are talking about mathematics. The Binary System,
   as a Mathematical System actually did not come into fruition
   until the 1600. That is, from the 5th Century to the 1600, what
   is thought to be a Binary System for Mathematical Enumeration,
   was in fact, either a system of Drum Beats for communications,
   a system of Open and Closed Bars used for counting, or a system
   for distinguishing musical notes in musical compositions. In
   any case, each of these so called Binary Systems shared the
   same flaw; they skew the counting by the misrepresentation of
   the Binary equivalent of '1'.

   1.1    Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz’s Binary System


    The general consensus regarding Leibniz would contend that,
    he made significant contributions to the foundations of
    Mathematics, Philosophy, and the beginnings of Set Theory.
    However, because he was indeed, a man of the times, Leibniz
    was occupied by a broad range of subjects. Nonetheless, while
    he did make significant contributions to humanity, an
    investigation of some of his most noted contributions would
    show that he did not completely finish the work for closure
    of the proposed subject(s). That is, I am of the opinion that,
    for most of his life, Leibniz was looking for the pieces of
    his puzzle, the clues or solution to clarify the concerns
    involving his ongoing research in the areas of Philosophy,
    Logic, and Metaphysics (The Laws and Logic of Critical
    Thinking). Needless to say, my opinion is evinced more
    clearly by the study of the works from one of his
    contemporaries, Perrie de Fermat, and the man most
    profoundly influenced by his research in Metaphysics,
    George Boole.

    Nevertheless, while Leibniz correctly translated the
    symbolisms for enumeration, as presented in the book of I
    Ching, into a Binary System of counting, which was similar
    to the Unary System. However, the reality of this
    accomplishment is that, his only achievement was the 'Ø'
    and the '1' solution to his problem concerning his
    Metaphysical Research, which pertained to the Logical
    Analysis for the presentation of 'The Laws and Logic of
    Critical Thinking'. In which case, had he either knew, or
    fully understood that Numerology, or Number Theory in
    general, involved the Logical Analysis of the Elementary
    Laws of Mathematics. He probably would have correctly
    completed his Numbering System, and 'Fermat's Last
    Theorem' would not have become one of the greatest, from
    a historical perspective, Mathematical Enigmas of all
    times. In any case, since 'Fermat's Last Theorem' was not
    solved until November 1979, there was no logical
    connection ever established between the works of Fermat
    and Leibniz. Hence, in the absence of a logical reason
    for a comparable analysis, there was no reason to
    question the validity of Leibniz's numerical translation.
    In other words, the Modern Binary System, as depicted in
    figure 1, is the direct consequence from the work of

    Leibniz, and it remains logically incorrect. This because,
    the discovery of the solution to the problem that qualified
    as the logical reason for the comparable analysis questioning
    his results, from the mathematical perspective, it violates
    the laws from elementary mathematics, the Field Postulates,
    the Axioms for Equality, and the logical foundation of
    Set Theory.

   1.2         George Boole's Mathematical Logic


    The influence of Leibniz upon George Boole is unquestionable,
    however, Boole's greatest contribution to mathematics
    overshadow considerably, his retake on objectives of
    Leibniz's life’s work. In other words, Boole's work; "An
    investigation of the Laws of Thought on Which are founded
    the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probability", is a
    mathematical and logical marvel that clearly renders a
    rational demystification of the Metaphysical rhetoric
    encompassing the logic of the 'Ø' and the '1' foundation,
    which was the hallmark of Leibniz pursuit to resolve 'The
    Laws and the Logic Foundation of Critical Thinking'. Still,
    George Boole was unaware of the contributions he made to
    Mathematics and the Mathematical Sciences, because it was
    embedded in his most famous work; "An investigation of
    the Laws of Thought on which are founded the Mathematical
    Theories of Logic and Probability". Furthermore, while
    using the principle foundation of the '0'and the '1'
    concepts created by Leibniz, Boole correctly established
    an Algebraic and Logical Foundation that was later to
    have applications throughout the fields Computer Science
    and Electronics. However, the result from Boole's work
    was wrongly interpreted as the 'Logic of the Binary
    System', when in fact, it is actually 'The Logic of the
    Unary System', because only One State Works, or because
    only One Stated Condition can be True, as shown in
    Figure 2.

    Nevertheless, given that an argument can be made claiming
    the existance of Two States, '0' and '1'. However, not until
    it is realized that Boole's ascribes to a literal usage,
    using their actual numeral values, it will then become
    understood that a Unary System is a Two State System,
    because it is a System of Counting uses '1s' to represent
    something and a '0' to represent nothing: 'Hence, A Two
    State System'. So, the question of ponder that one might
    ask is: 'If the number of States in the Logic of the
    Modern Binary System equals that of the Unary System.
    How many States defined by Boolean Relationships does the
    True Binary System have ...??... Figure 3.

   1.3   The Arithmetical Error and the flaw in Binary Enumeration



    While it should be quite clear that a fundamental knowledge
    of Archeagology, Anthropology, and perhaps that of the early
    Languages, is a necessary prequsite to the study of any
    anchient Civilization. Still, there should never be any
    doubts that if there is, or was a Civilization whose first
    system of counting was a True Binary System, then this would
    probably be the most advanced Civilization in the Universe.
    In other words, because of the inherent complexities involved
    in the meaning and the interpretation of the concept of Zero,
    the development of a True Binary System by any Ancient or
    Primitive Civilization boarders on the Highly Unlikely, or
    the Impossible. In which case, prior to Leibniz's discovery
    of the Two State Logical System for his Metaphysical
    Analysis of Critical Thinking, I cannot accept as being
    possible for any Civilization, before his time, to have
    either created, or fully understood the Mathematics of the
    Binary System. The case in point is the mathematical error
    discovered in 1999, which was an obvious mathematical
    descrepancy between two different Binary Mathematical
    Systems. However, it is also quite obvious that knowone
    since Leibniz, could either rationalize this difference,
    or understood why a difference occured. And while the most
    notiable self-rightous and unspoken claims, under the guise
    of Religin, Politics, Racial, or Economic depervation /
    discrimination, for every Civilization since mankinds
    beginnings, has been the horrifyingly tortoureous control
    and exploits of its people. Yet, even with the persistance
    of these living conditions today, it is still difficult not
    wonder, how, or why it is possible for a blunder having such
    simple a solution, could have lasted for so long.  ...???...

    In other words, the pointed reality of this descrapancy, ask
    the question: 'Is it possible for a one-to-correspondence of
    a Set X, with the Set of Integers, I, which yields the count
    of the total number of members the Set X contains, to have
    more than one value to represented in the Set I?' {... No!}
    That is, it is not possible for any one-to-one pairing
    between the members of two Sets, the Set X, and the Set I,
    for any member contained in any one of the two Sets to have
    more than one pairing with the members of the other Set. And
    this is because, such a pairing establishes a count that can
    be translated into a equality, when both Sets, given in Table
    I, are said to represent the same (Identical) method for
    enumeration.

    In any case, to say the very least, it should be quite clear
    from the examination of Table I, that if a given Binary
    Number, say, '11111111', has two Intergeral Values, '255'
    and '256', there is a undeinable problem with the Binary
    System when it is used as a System of Counting. Still,
    anyone, and with good reason, could quite easily present
    the excues; "It is a Typo-Graphical Error!", as a viable
    opposing argument. However, such an argument would easily
    fail, because there is absolutely No proof, if
    {a, b} = {0, 1}, which would now account for the existence
    of the 4 conditions that must clearly represent a number;
    Substitution Law for Equality now yields,{a, a}, {a, b},
    {b, a}, and {b, b} given in Table II. Especially since, it
    is evident in this scenario that Zero cannot be equal to

    either '0', or the Null Set, (Out of Sight, Out of the
    Consciencous thought ... Does not exist!) because 'a'
    references something in the real sence. Furthermore, when
    comparing the three rows from Table I, it is also evident
    that there is a common coefficient between different
    numerical representations that are equal to the same number.
    But, this accestment is only valid between the members of
    columns 2 and 3 in Table I, and conditionally valid between
    the members of columns 1, 2, and 3, in Table II.



     Note: The unfortunate reality of Table II, is that, the New
           Binary System impacts Gregor Mendel's work in Genetics.
           In other words, from an 'A a' and ‘B b’ paring,
           {A, a, B, b}, Mendel's results referenced only 6 of
           the possible 16* combinations; {A, A}, {B, B}, {A, B},
           {B, b} {A, a}, and {a, b}. However, while I have not
           wrote the New Foundation representing Finite Chemistry,
           the reality of the mathematical results from the
           Mathematics of Quantification now questions the
           validity of Mendel's claims. In any case, it has been
           proven, using the current foundation, that the order
           of the addition of Chemicals is a vital consideration
           for the determination of the Chemistry of the
           resulting Chemical Compound (10 combinations are
           missing*). Still, what’s alarming? Well.
           ...considering the ‘X’ and ‘Y’ Chromosomes that
           represent this relationship. This also suggest the
           possibility of an error in the Chromosome Count
           defining the Base Pairs; A = adenosine, C = cytosine,
           G = guanine, and T = thymine, given that they current
           identify 23  +  23  =  46 Chromosomes. That is, from
           the Mathematics of Quantification this defines,
           2^5  +  2^5  =  2^6  =  64  =  8^2 Chromosomes, four
           pairs of 8 Bit Bases Pairs, or 32  +  32  =  64, that
           yields about 2^32 = 4,294,967,296 Bases, which
           translates into two 8^10 pairs of 8 Bit Bases Pairs
           per Cell of human DNA. (et 2004)

    Nevertheless, while studying the analysis from Tables III and
    IV, recall the former proofs, because it was clearly shown
    that if '00 = aa = 1', and '01 = ab = 02', and the Exponent
    'F = either a Rational or Irrational Number, then the Binary
    Translation could only equal the Binary Representation for
    the Number. This meant, the exponent 'F' was not a whole
    Number. However, when the result from the secquential variable
    of the exponent having a of base '2' equaled the value of a
    whole number, and the exponent was also a whole number, then
    given that 'Multiplication is the Quantified Sum of Addition',
    the the value of the exponent equaled the sum of the Binary
    1's and the Product of the Binary 1's equaled the Binary
    Number and the Unary Number. That is,





       because '2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 128 = 1111111 = 2^7'


       and '2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 256 = 11111111 = 2^8',





    there is clearly a relationship between the columns in Table
    IV, and since (2 + 2) = (2 x 2), it shall be proven in Part
    II, not only that the established proof for the New Binary
    System remains correct. But, that its validity is derived
    from the proof of 'Fermat's Last Theorem' and the discovery
    of the 'Distributive Law for Exponental Functions'.
    Nevertheless, this proves that the differences between
    Tables III and IV clearly do not represent a Contradiction,
    the necessary requirement as stated by "Chief Executive
    Administrator for The Electronic Library of Mathematics",
    Aleksandar Perovic, when he said: "Mathematicians do not
    accept claims at truth of any possible, non-selfcontradictory
    (= consistent) mathematical system". Needless to say, while
    this difference is not a Contradiction, it is indeed a
    troubling Inconsistancy which at the very least, warrents an
    investigation.

2.  The Unary and The Binary Mathematical Systems



    Throughout mankinds beginnings, there has been several
    different Systems of Counting, several different methods
    for performing elementary arithmetic, and an equal number
    symbols for those that were written, as well as the variety
    of sounds for those that were only spoken. However, only one
    numbering system, which is nearly complete, survived the
    trials of mankind's jouney towards civilation; 'The Unary
    System'. And while the Laws from the Axioms for Equality,
    the Field Postuletes, and Logic of Set Theory, which are
    an essenctial part of Unary System, was not developed until
    long after its discovery, sometime during the early and mid
    1800's. Still, it doubtful that anyone before 1979, tested
    the validity of the Unary System. Needless to say, it
    should be quite clear now, that every System of Enumeration
    must comply with the Laws from the Axioms for Equality, the
    Field Postuletes, and Logic of Set Theory before it can ever
    be accepted as a valid System of Counting, which conforms to
    the elementary laws of arithmetic. In other words, the
    additional requirement, which any civilization must meet to
    claim the creation or the development of a True Binary
    System, is one that requires a prior the knowledge of the
    Unary System. If not, how could anyone justify the use of
    two objects to account for only one material possession...
    Hence, to use a Stick to represent the sumation of an
    arithmetic progression incrimented by the addition of 1,
    is far simplier than the use or discovery of the 'Stick
    and a Rock', which is used to represent the same
    incrimented addition. Clearly, if this were not the case,
    then the Binary System would not have, after its initial
    claim of discovery, to wait 2500 years to become a True
    Binary System.

   2.1   Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem; and The Two Distributive
         Laws



    It is extremely amazing that it required more than 300 years
    after 'Perrie de Fermat' composed, before his death in 1665,
    a riddle involving an elementary algebraic equation, which
    eluded everyone, including the greatest mathematicians, to
    find, in 1979, a solution. A joke? Perhaps. But, Fermat was
    the first to claim, while writing this riddle, that he knew
    the simple solution. And clearly, if this were true, which I
    believe that it is, then perhaps, "Fermat's Last Theorem"
    should rightfully be called; 'the greatest joke of all times'.
    However, while I accept Fermat's claim, I do not believe that
    he actually knew, or fully understood, the profound
    implications of his discovery. Especially since, it may be
    concluded, as presented below, there are only 3 loghically
    vaible 'Interconnected Complimentary Solutions' that would
    solve the riddle regarding why;




      "There are No solutions in Whole Numbers to the Equation,

                    X^N + Y^N = Z^N, when N > 2".



   1. There is no Common Coefficient between the Sum of Two
      Exponents, the Exponent equaling their Result, and their
      respective Roots, when 'N > 2' , and 'N' defines the
      Exponent of the base variables. (Equal Number of Parts
      Contained in the Whole.)

   2. Fermat's Solution defines how he interpretated the problem,
      which is based upon the current mathematical knowledge
      known duing his time: Pythagoras Theorem, and the
      (Analytical Geometric) solution explaining the Difference
      regarding 'Why', when 'N = 2'; 'The Sum of the Area of two
      Perfect Squares Equals the Area of another Perfect Square'.
      And, when 'N = N', 'The Sum of the Areas of two Perfect
      Nth Powers is not Equal to the 'ROOT' defining the Area of
      a Perfect Nth Power'. Nevertheless, this assumption builds
      an explanation that explains this difference, which it is
      believed to be the foundation for the proof that Fermat
      claimed would not fit in the margin of his paper, but
      would explain why, when 'N > 2', his theorem is true.



   3. In Exponental Operations, there is No equal Distribution
      of Multiplication over Addition when 'N > 2', and 'N'
      defines the value of the Exponent. (The Discovery of
      the Distributive Law for Exponental Functions, and the
      Foundation for the Finite Mathematical Field: "The
      Rudiments of Finite Algebra; The Results of
      Quantification".)

    Nevertheless, proof that it is assumed Fermat was thinking
    about, would proceed something like this, when 'N = 2':



    ""If the Length of the Side of a Perfect Square inscribing
      another Perfect Square is equal to 'X + Y', then the Sum
      of the Areas of Two Perfect Squares is equal to the Area
      of the Perfect Square inscribing another Perfect Square,
      and since the Area of a Square is given by;


             1.    'L x W = Area',



      the Area of the Inscribing Perfect Square, from the
      Mathematics of Quantification is given as;


         2.    (X + Y) x (X + Y) = (X + Y)^2 = X^2 + 2XY + Y^2


      And if the Length of the Side of the inscribed Perfect
      Square is equal to 'Z', and the Area of this Perfect
      Square is given by equation 1, then from Pythagoras
      Theorem, 'Z' is the Root of the equation given by;


             3.    X^2 + Y^2 = Z^2 = L x W = Z x Z

     Hence, the 'X, Y, and Z' variables, by Pythagoras Theorem now
     equals the Sides of the 4 Right Triangles forming, or Creating
     the Boarders of the Inscribing Perfect Square and the Perfect
     Square it inscribes. That is, if the Length of the Two Sides
     joining the 90 degree angle of the Right Triangle equals 1/4
     the Length of the Parimeter of theInscribing Perfect Square,
     then the Sum of the X and Y variables defining the Two Sides
     of the Right Triangle equals the Length of the Side of the
     Inscribing Perfect Square. And given by equation 4, we have;


                4.    X + Y = Y + X, which means:


      If the Sum of the Length of the Two Sides, 'X + Y' of any
      Right Triangle forming the Right Angeled boarder of any
      Perfect Square, any Square having Four Equal Sides, is
      equal to 1/4 the Length of its Parameter, then the Sum of
      the Length of the Two Sides of the Right Triangle, is
      equal to the Length of One Side of the Perfect Square.
      (The Associative Law for Equality; "X + Y = Y + X".
      ET 2004)

      Furthermore, if the Sum of the Length of the Two Sides,
      'X + Y' of any Right Triangle forming the boarder of any
      Perfect Sqaure equals the Length of One of its Sides,
      and if a Perfect Square defines the Closed shape of a
      figure having the 4 Sides defined by the shape of a
      Rectangle, but equal, then the boaders of the Perfect
      Square is defined by Four Equal Right Triangles. Hence,
      from Pythagoras Theorem, if of the Two Sides of the
      Right Triangles forming the boarders of the Perfect
      Square join to form the 90 degree Right Angles
      connecting the 4 Sides of the Perfect Square, then the
      Two Sides of the Right Triangles must respectively Equal
      the Adjance Side and the Side Opposite the Hypotnuse.
      Therefore, since the Right Triangles join the Sides of
      the Perfect Square, the connection of the Side forming
      the Hypotenuse of the Right Triangles must also meet,
      and be joined at 90 degree angles. And if the Four Right
      Triangles are equal, then the Length of Hypotenuse equals
      the Length of One Side of an Inscribed Perfect Square.

      In other words, this means that; The Sum of the Areas of
      Two Perfect Squares equals the Area of the Perfect Square
      Inscribing another Perfect Square, if and only if, The Sum
      of the Areas of the Four equal Right Triangles forming the

      boarders of the Inscribing Perfect Square and the Area of
      the Perfect Square it Inscribes, equals the Area of the
      Perfect Square Inscribing another Perfect Square. And from
      equation 5, the Area of a Triangle is given by;



                5.    1/2(b x h)



      And given that only the Adjancent Side and the Opposite
      Side of the Right Triangles can, respectively equal the
      Base, b, and the Height, h, since there a 4 Right Triangles
      having equal sides, X and Y, by equation 5, the Area of the
      4 Right Triangles is given by;



                6.    4((1/2(X x Y) = 4/2(XY) = 2XY



      And from these results, it is easy to descern the equation
      for Sum of Areas of the 4 Right Triangles, as given by the
      equation;



                7.    (X - Y) x (X - Y) = X^2 - 2XY + Y^2, where


                8.    X^2 + Y^2 = 2XY



      Hence, the Area of the Perfect Square Inscribing a Perfect
      Square, which is equal to the Sum of the Areas of Two
      Perfect Squares, is given by;



          9.    (X + Y) x (X + Y) = X^2 + 2XY + Y^2 = 2XY + Z^2


      Therefore;


           10.    X^2 + Y^2 = 2XY - 2XY + Z^2 = X^2 + Y^2 = Z^2

      Thus, the equation, X^2 + Y^2 = Z^2, which is defined by
      Pythagoras Theorem, clearly states that the Sum of the
      Areas of Two Perfect Squares is equal to the Area of a
      Perfect Square"".


      And clearly, from his analysis, Fermat would have concluded
      the X and Y relations:


           11.   If X = Y, then X and Y are Two equal Perfect
                 Squares, and If X > Y, or Y > X, then X and Y
                 are Two different equally Perfect Squares.

    And clearly, from this analysis, Fermat would easily conclude
    that if the length of the Sides of a Perfect Cube are equal
    to that of a Perfect Square, when 'N = 3', then the Area of
    Cube is given by;



                12.    L x W x T = Area

The Ternary Logical States of the Binary System     October 28, 2006




    Hence, would have also known that since Area of Cube is given
    by equation 12, the Sides of a Perfect Cube are equal to that
    of a Perfect Square, when 'N = 3', must be equal, that the
    change in equation 12 is given by equation 13;



         13.    L  × W  ×  T  =  Area  = X  ×  Y  ×  R  =  Z^3



    Hence, If the Root of Z^3 is equal to (X  +  Y), then the
    Area of a Perfect Cube, which inscribes another Perfect Cube
    is equal to the equation given by;



                14.    (X + Y)  ×  (X + Y)  ×  (X + Y)  =

                       (X + Y)  ×  (X^2 + 2XY + Y^2) =

                        X^3 + 3X^2Y + 3XY^2 + Y^3



    Furthermore, he would have quickly noticed that a Perfect
    Cube has 8 90 degree Angles forming its boarders, or 4 pairs
    of 3 dimensional Right triangles, Prisms having 5, 2
    dimensional face. This he would have reasoned further, meant
    that, only a Pyramid could have 4 equal lengths measuring its
    sides. In other words, Fermat would have quickly concluded
    that, it is not possible for either any one of the 8, or 4
    pairs of Right Triangles forming the boarders of a Perfect
    Cube, could have equal sides, and still be a Right Triangle.
    Needless to say, he would have also known that this did not
    mean that the Sum of the Areas of these 3 dimensional Right
    Triangles did not equal the Area of a Perfect Cube.

    Nevertheless, he would continue to follow the logic from the
    conclusions involving 'N = 2' by first, confirming the formula
    for the Area of a 3 dimensional Traingle, to determine if the
    Sum of the Areas of Two Perfect Cubes is equal to the Area of
    another Perfect Cube. However, he would eventually notice,
    that while the Volume and the the Area of a Perfect Cube were
    equal formulas, the Volume and the Area of a 3 dimensional
    Triangle, or Prism, represented 2 different formulas. Where
    by, the Area of a 3 dimensional triangles is given by equation
    13a, the Volume of the same Triangle is given by equation 13b;


E Terrell                   Internet Draft                 [Page 24]

The Ternary Logical States of the Binary System     October 28, 2006





                14a.     Area of a Prism = A = 2(b^2) + 3b(h),
                         where b^2 = Area of base,
                         3b = b + b + b = Perimeter of base,
                         and h = Height of the Prism

                14b.    Volume of Traingle = V =
                        Area of the Base (B^2) x the Height (h) =
                        b^2h = b^2(h) = B^2 x h,
                        V = b^2(h)



    Clearly, while an argument can be made regarding the
    difference between the formulas in equations 14a and 14b,
    which represents the two distinct results that respectively
    measure the 'Area of a Prism' and the Volume of 3 dimensional
    Triangle. Even still, Fermat would have probably continued to
    follow the logical patterns reasoning derived from the
    conclusions when 'N = 2', because he could quite easily test
    for the conclusions that would verify either one, or both of
    these formulas. Thus, following the logical reasoning
    concluding equations 6, 7, and 8, in an attempt to dervie the
    results that would conclude the Perfect Cube, which logically
    concludes results simular to that involving equations 9 and 10.

    Needless to say, I am hard pressed to imagine, but I seriously
    doubt that Fermat was supprised by his discovery, when trying
    to confirm equations 14a and 14b, that there are actually 5
    different formulas, which must be used in the logical analysis
    that would determine the validity of; 'The Sum of the Areas /
    Volume of Two Perfect Cubes are equal to the Area, or Volume of
    another Perfect Cube'. In any case, it should be understood
    that the Cubes of the 'X, Y, and Z' variables must be Positive
    Integers, because their respective Cube Roots must be a
    Positive Integer. Where by, given below, we have;





   15.    [(X + Y) x (X + Y)] X (X - Y) = X^3 + X^2y - XY^2 - Y^3



   16.    [(X - Y) x (X - Y)] X (X + Y) = X^3 - X^2y + XY^2 + Y^3

The Ternary Logical States of the Binary System     October 28, 2006




   17.    [(X - Y) x (X + Y)] X (X - Y) = X^3 - X^2y - XY^2 + Y^3



   18.    [(X - Y) x (X + Y)] X (X + Y) = X^3 + X^2y - XY^2 - Y^3





    And since by Definition;


             Exponent: Any symbolic representation, 'Q', which
                       is used inconjuction with the Number, 'X',
                       representing a Multiplicand, represents
                       the count of the number of Identical
                       Multiplicands used in the equation
                       representing Product of Q Multiplicands;
                       x^Q = (Xv1 x Xv2 x Xv3 x ... XvQ).



    Hence, given by equation 19, we have;



  19.    [(X - Y) x (X - Y)] X (X - Y) = X^3 - 3X^2y + 3XY^2 - Y^3




    Clearly, once Fermat realized, upon inspection of equations
    14a through 19, that neither the Sum of the Areas, or the
    Volumes of the Right Angled Prisms forming the Perimeter of
    the Perfect Cube equaled the factors from equaton 12,
    '3X^2Y + 3XY^2', whose difference would yield the same
    conclusions established by equation 18. He would have
    reasoned that, 'The Sum of either the Area, or the Volume of
    Two Perfect Cubes did not equal another Perfect Cube',
    because there is a divergence diminishing the equality
    between factors in noted equations. And further testing, he
    would have reasoned, the divergence diminishing the equality
    between factors increases for every unit of increase of the
    Exponent, 'N'. Hence, he would finally concluded, since
    (2 + 2) = (2 x 2), "There are No solutions in Whole Numbers
    to the Equation, X^N + Y^N = Z^N,  when N > 2", because the
    Operation of Multiplication, M, is equal to the Operation of


E Terrell                   Internet Draft                 [Page 26]

The Ternary Logical States of the Binary System     October 28, 2006




    Addition, A, M = A, only when the number Variables involved
    in each of these operations, is equal to TWO. And the
    translation, or interpretation of this conclusion yields;
    'If the Whole Number sought must be equal to the Root of a
    Square, because a Perfect Square equals the Product of Two
    Equal Variables. And since an equation of Mutilpication is
    equal to an equation of Addition only when each of these
    operations involves two variables, then only an equation
    equaling Sum of the Two Variables equal to the Two Perfect
    Squares can equal the Product of the Two equal variables
    that is equal to a Perfect Square'.

    In which case, there is no Integer that can equal the Nth
    Root of the Nth Power that is equal to the equation of the
    Sum of Two Nth Powers. "In other words, since an equivalency
    between the Operations of Multiplication and Addition only
    exists at Power of 2 (denoting the number of Variables
    involved in both of these operations), then only the Sum
    of (in this case; Two) Perfect Squares can equal the
    product of the two equal multiplicands, which is equal to
    another Perfect Square, and still retain an integer
    solution for the values of the Variables representing
    Power of the Exponent and the respective Roots".



      Note: I investigated the same conditions, in the proof
            entitled; "The Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem; The
            Revolution in Mathematical Thought". However, I
            concluded, from the same data, that "If 'N > 2' in
            the equation, X^N + Y^N = Z^N, then there are no
            Whole Number Solutions for the Nth Power of the
            Sum of Two Nth Powers and their respective Nth
            Roots. That is, because there is No incremental
            (Additive) progression using ' 1's ' defined for
            Fermat's / Pythagoras Equation, the Integer
            Coefficient, which is the Common Coefficient
            between the Powers of N and their respective Nth
            Roots do not exist. Nevertheless, this concludes
            the rendering of the proof, that I believe, Fermat
            understood to be True.

    Nevertheless, from the analysis of the forgoing conclusions,
    and the realization that equation 8 and the equation from
    "Fermat's Last Theorem", represented a special case defining
    the 'Distributive Law', as given by equations 19 through 24.
    That I also understood the profound meaning of the proof of
    "Fermat's Last Theorem". In other words, I reasoned first;
    'Any complete proof of "Fermat's Last Theorem" must be
    founded upon the 'Distributive Law', and conclude with the
    discovery of a New 'Distributive Property'. And this meant
    that when 'N > 2' in the equation, X^N + Y^N = Z^N, the
    Multiplication was not equally Distributed over the
    operation of Addition. Hence, from the results of equations
    19 through 24, it is was easy to conclude, since the
    Operation of Mutiplication is not equally Distributed over
    Addition in the case where 'N > 2': There is no Common
    Coefficient between the Nth Power of the Sum of Two Nth
    Powers, and their respective Nth Roots. In which case, I
    concluded that Fermat was correct, and had the knowledge of
    proof I demonstrated above. However, Fermat's mathematical
    background lead me to conclude that he did not understand
    fully the implication of his riddle, because I believe, if
    he did, he would made a pointed reference.

   Special Case of the Distributive Law is the conclusion of
   Equation 25:




             20.    (X - Y)^2 =

                    (X - Y) × (X - Y) =

             22.    (X + Y)^2 =

                    (X + Y) × (X + Y) =

                     X^2 + 2XY + Y^2


             23.    X^2 + 2XY + Y^2 =

                          2XY + Z^2


             24.    X2 + Y2 =

                    Z^2 + 2XY - 2XY =

                    X^2 + Y^2 = Z^2


             25.    Z^2 = 2XY:

                    hence, X^2 + Y^2 = Z^2

                    X^2 + Y^2 = 2XY

                    X^2 + Y^2 = XY + XY = X(Y + Y)

    Furthermore, because the conclusion from the proof and the
    equation involved in "Fermat's Last Theorem", represented
    an Algebraic Expression of the Exponential Function
    concluding the existence of the 'Distributive Law for
    Exponential / Non-Linear Functions.  I knew, or reasoned,
    since the Distributive Law is also logically valid in
    ‘Set Theory’, that an Exponential Expansion of the
    Mathematical Logic of Set Theory must also sustain logical
    validity, and conclude the logical support for the
    conclusions derived from the foregoing proof: The Discovery
    of a New Distributive Property. Still, the clarification and
    definition of the Exponent, and the Exponential Operations
    employed in the Mathematical Logic of Set Theory, required
    more precise definitions of the familiar operations involving
    Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. In other
    words, the Exponential Expansion of Set Theory, which also
    logically sustains only the operations of Addition and
    Subtraction, nearly mirrors the proof of the ‘Distributive
    for Exponential / Non-Linear Functions. And the Exponential
    Expansion of the Field Postulates, concluded the existence
    of the Mathematics of Quantification, which is defined as a

  Addition: The mathematical operation representing a

                         The Definitions


  Disjoint:   If there are two sets, A and B, such that, A and B
              share no common members, then the two sets are said
              to be Disjoint; A ñ B, (read; A is not connected to
              B: ‘A ñ B = Ø’.



  Dis-Union:   If A U B = C and C n A = A is true, then the
               Dis-Union of the Set A from the Set C, C U A = B,
               (read; C dis-union A) is the exclusion of the
               members from the Set C, which are common to the
               Sets C and A, iff, A ñ B = Ø.



                  2.  If A ? C and C n A = B, then C U A = E ñ D.


                  3.  If every Set A is a Sub-Set of itself, and
                      A n A = A, then A U A = Ø.


  Exponential Cardinal: If for every X, where X ? U, there is a
  condition, such that;

                 X n X = X,
                 X n X n X = X,
                 (Xv1 n Xv2 n Xv3 n ...  n XvQ) = X, and
                 X^Q = X is True.

                 Then there is a Exponential Number, Q, called
                 the Exponential Cardinal of X, which is the
                 number that represents the occurrences of X in
                 the equation representing it’s Intersection.


    Set:  If a Unit Whole contains a collection of Objects, and
          each Object defines, one and only one, Part belonging
          to the Unit Whole, then the Unit Whole defines a Set
          as a Collection of Objects, iff, each Object defines
          one and only one Element, or Member, that defines the
          Part belonging to the Unit Whole.

                           The Theorems


  Sub-Set:  If every element, ?, of a Set B is a ? of the Set A,
            then the Set A is said to contain every ? of the Set
            B, and the Set B is said to be a Sub-Set of the Set
            A. Hence, every Set is a Sub-Set of itself, iff,
            A n A = A.


  Cardinal Number: If it may be concluded that the Multiplicative
                   Identity Law is True, and X × 1 = X, where X
                   does not change, then from Set Theory, X is the
                   Multiplicative Identity of Itself. And if this
                   defines X, when X = X^Q, then X defines the
                   Identity Element as the Unit Base, or the
                   Cardinal Number = 1 defines the Common
                   Coefficient as the Multiplicative Identity
                   Element for all X| X ? U.

 Therefore, if {Uv1 n Uv2 n Uv3 n ...  n UvQ} = U^Q = U^Qv{N} = U,
 and given that Multiplication is the Quantified Sum of Addition,
 where X^Q = U^Qv{N} is True. Then for all X| X ? U = U^Qv{N} = UvN,
 the Cardinality of any Set UN, is the Sum or Union of Cardinal
 Numbers, or
 UvN  =  {Xv1 U Xv2 U ... U XvQ}  =  (1v1 + 1v2 + ... + 1vQ),
 iff, for all X| X ? U, X = 1 defines the Cardinal Number for the
 ? of every Set as a Sub-Set of I | I = Set of Integers.

 In which case, the Unary Set, {1}, defines the Cardinal for the
 ? X of the Set I for all X| X ? I, given that I = {X}, when X = 1,
 and the Cardinal for every ? X of the Set I for all X| X ? I,
 when
 I = {X, X, X … X}, and X = 1, I = (1v1 + 1v2 + 1v3 +  ...  + 1vQ).


    Hence, the definition of a Cardinal Number is given by:


   Cardinal Number: The Cardinal Number is the Multiplicative
                    Identity Element for all X| X ? I, which
                    represents the Element of the Unary Set
                    that is used to determine the Cardinality
                    of every Set from the Sum or Union of the
                    Multiplicative Identity Element for
                    every ? X of the Set I: iff X^Q = X.

        Note: This defines the Unit Base X, for all X| X ? I as the
              Element of the Unary Set, because X is the
              Multiplicative Identity of Itself that defines, X = 1.



     [The next proof presented, is the interpretation of the Proof,
      or implications, that Fermat never understood, or could not
      explain. This is the accepted rationalization because Set
      Theory, the complete Logical Model of Mathematics, was not
      finished for nearly 200 years later. However, because he
      Co-Discovered the Cartesian Coordinate System representing
      the Mathematics of Analytic Geometry. The mathematical
      relationships from the foregoing, he should have maintained
      an above average understanding of the foundational theory of
      the proof presented. Still, for me, these results initially
      implied the existence of: the ‘Distributive Law for
      Exponential / Non-Linear Functions’; an alternate
      Mathematical Field that was Finite and Closed / True as
      defined by the Axiom for Equality, the Field Postulates,
      and Set Theory. In which, it was later discovered, actually
      defined the Binary Set and the {Binary Enumeration &
      Mathematics} Mathematics of the Binary System.
      e. Terrell 1983]


    Nevertheless, since the foregoing conclusions proves that
    because the ‘Multiplicative Identity Element’ defines the
    Universal ‘Common Coefficient’, which is the same for all
    Objects, as the element, 1, defined in the Unary Set. And
    since it may also be concluded that counting is actually
    the assignment of a ‘1’ to every object to be counted, and
    then, adding the “1’s” that represent the objects,
    determines the Cardinality of the Set containing the objects
    being counted. Clearly, if the Set I, the Set of Integers
    defines the Set of all Symbols used to represent the result
    of the addition, inclusion, or incremental progression using
    the element, 1, defined in the Unary Set (given by Table II),
    then the (Arabic Numerals / Positive Integers) Modern System
    of Counting is defined by the Unary Set: As a Unary System.

    In other words, since the Cardinal Number, by definition,
    must define the Neutral Multiplicative Identity Element that
    represents the Unit Base X of X^Q, then any change in the
    Count of the Number of Members contained in the Set X, must
    define the Union (or Sum) of the members belonging to the
    Disjoint Set representing the Set Xv[2 thru N], iff X = X^Q,
    the Cardinality of the Set equals the Sum of the Cardinal
    Numbers representing each of the its Members.




    In which case:




    If the Unit Base X of X^Q is defined ONLY when
    X =XvN = X^Q remains valid, and;



    I.   2 Members in a Binary Set =
           (A U B)^Q  =  Xv[2 =  (A U B)] = X^Q, or


    II.  3 Members in a Ternary Set =
          (A U B U C)^Q = Xv[3 = (A U B U C)] = X^Q, or


    III. 4 Members in a Quaternary Set =
          (A U B U C U D)^Q = Xv[4 = (A U B U C U D)] = X^Q, or


    IV.  N Members in a N-nary Set =
           (A U B U … U NvN)^Q = Xv[N  =  (A U B U … U N)] = X^Q,

         is TRUE,

       THEN:



    I.a     2 Members in a Binary Set  =
                         Xv[2 =  (A U B)] = X^2 = X^Q, or


    II.a    3 Members in a Ternary Set  =
                         Xv[3 =  (A U B U C)] = X^3 = X^Q, or


    III.a   4 Members in a Quaternary Set  =

                         Xv[N  =  (A U B U … U N)]  = X^N = X^Q,


       Must also be TRUE.





   In other words, the Proof for the existence of any Numbering
   System involving the Unit Base X of X^Q, would conclude the
   definition for the existence of another system of counting.
   And this defines a Unit Base X of X^Q containing more Base
   elements than Unary System, as the UNION of More than One

    If for all X | X ? I, X = X for every XvU = X^Q, and when
    X = XvU there is a XvN | XvN = X^Q, which also True for all
    X | X ? I for every X = XvN when X = X and
    XvN = (A U B U C U ••• U N), then XvN = XvU,
    if and only if (iff):



      X^QV{U} = XvU = X^Q = ‘X’ = X^Q = XvN = X^Qv{N},
      or XvN ? XvU, because X ? XvN.



    Proof: Since the Theorem concluding the definition for the
           Cardinal Number defines the ? of Unary Set as the
           Unit Base X of X^Q for all X | X ? I, then the
           Multiplicative Identity Element for all X | X ? I
           defines XvN = XvU when X = XvU.

   
    Therefore, when XvN = XvU,
                  and N = 2 = Q, X n X
                        = X^[Q = 2] = (A U B) n (A U B)
              X^[Q = 2} = (A U B) n (A U B)
                        = (A n A) U [(A n B) U (A n B)] U (B n B)

    And from the Distributive Law;



          (A n A) U (B n B)  = [(A n B) U (A n B)]
                             = (A B) U (A B) = A (B U B)




    Hence, from the Substitution Law for Equality;
    X = XvU = (X U Y), equation 25;

    [(A n B) U (A n B)] = (X n Y) U (X n Y)
                        = (XY) U (XY) = X (Y U Y):

    which concludes; XvN = XvU, X = (A U B), and the
    Unit base X of X^[Q = 2] defines

    X = X, which means, by definition; X (Y U Y) = X (Y + Y).





    In other words, this proves Fermat’s Last Theorem and
    confirms the definition of the Cardinal Number, ‘1’, for
    the Binary Set given by:


  Cardinal Number:  The Cardinal Number is the Multiplicative
  Identity Element for all X| X ? I, which represents the Elements
  of the Binary Set that is used to determine the Cardinality of
  every Set from the Sum or Union of the Multiplicative Identity
  Element for every ? X of the Set I: iff X^Q = X.


  And from the foregoing (excluding the rigor from the Mathematical
  Logic) it can be easily proven that since A, B, C, D, … N must
  be Disjoint initially, when defining the elements, ?, contained
  in the Unit Base X of X^Q; by the equations given below, X = X^Q
  is not valid. In other words, because there is no confirmation
  by the Distributive Law for XvN = XvU for all X | X = X^Q when
  Q = N, and N > 2.

    Nevertheless, these conclusions confirm the existence of the
    Two Systems of counting defining; ‘The Unary Set’ and ‘The
    Binary Set’, they also support the conclusion defining these
    Sets, by Figure 11, as; ‘The Infinite Set = Unary System’

       When X = (A U B), X defines the Binary pair {a, b}




    And reasoned further that if either ‘a’, or ‘b’ is equal to
    the Null Set {Ø}, then the foregoing conclusions would be
    invalid. Moreover, since the Cardinal Number, the
    Multiplicative Identity Element of the Unary Set, is same
    for Binary Set, the Binary pair, {a, b}, must represent, by

    In other words, from the definition of the Cardinal Number,
    the Cardinality of the Unary and the Binary Sets represents a
    1 : 11 ratio, which denotes the number of Elements each Set
    contains. Nevertheless, the defining expression representing
    this relationship given by;


  ‘Unary Set = 1’, ‘Binary Set = 11’, or  ‘1 = 2’ - 'Prime Numbers'

        Note: A 'Prime Number' or 'Prime Integer', is a positive
              integer, 'p = 1', that has no positive integer
              divisors other than itself, 'p', and '1'.

   And if, from the Substitution Law for Equality; {0, 1} = {a, b},
   where ‘1 = {00}, and {00}  ?  {Ø}’, then the correct Binary
   System and its associated method for enumeration, given by Table
   IV, confirms ‘11111111 = 256 = 2^8, because
      2^8 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2  = 11111111 = 256’.
   Hence, the definition of the Cardinal Number, by figure 11,
   defines the special case of the Distributive Law as the
   intersection of the Distributive Properties defining the Binary
   and the Unary Sets, for all X | for every ? of I, the Cardinal
   Number X, defines the Cardinality of both Sets.

   2.3   The Binary and Ternary Systems and George Boole's
         Mathematical Logic


    It should readily be concluded, because it has been mentioned
    that the Boolean, or Leibniz, Operators are Unary; they are
    both logically valid for the Unary and the Binary Systems.
    Furthermore, since Zero, Ø, or the Null Set, is not defined
    by the Cardinal Number, which is equal to the Unit Base X of
    XQ for all X| X ? I, then Ø, is not an element of the Set of
    Integers, ‘I’. Hence, Binary and Ternary Logic, or 3 State
    Logic is defined by the Unary Set, and contains the elements
    {Ø, +1} and {-1, Ø, +1}, which are governed by the Closure
    Laws. Given by Table VIII, we have;

    Note: It should be understood nevertheless, these conclusions
          confirms that the Binary System is Finite and Closed
          over 'R' (not true for all values of the Base Variables
          over ‘R’, and the Unary System is Infinite, and it is
          also Closed over 'R'.

    This document, whose only objective was the deliberation of
    the final explanation of the new foundation for the Binary
    System, which resulted from the Mathematics of Quantification,
    does not directly raise any security issues. Hence, there are
    no issues that warrant Security Considerations.

           II. Using Extended ASCII CODE & Binary '00' = 1

     In the Extended ASCII CODE character Set, True Zero is
     defined as the Null Set Character, ' Ø  '. However,
     because Binary equivalent of ' 1 ' is ' 00 ', I believe
     that it would be easier if the Character Set were changed
     to represent the Binary equivalent of ' 1 ' as ' 0 ', as
     opposed to '00', because '00' is 2 Bits and '0' is '1' Bit.

 Work(s) in Progress;


 Computer Science / Internet Technology:
 
  These drafts represent the twelve chapters of the Networking
  Bible, designing a Network IP Addressing Specification that
  maintains a 100 Percent backward compatibility with the IPv4
  Specification. In other words, this is a design specification
  developed from the Theory of the Expansion of the IPv4 IP
  Addressing Specification, which allowed the representation of
  the Network for the entire World on paper, and the possibility
  of an Infinite IP Address Pool. Nevertheless, the
  Internet-Drafts listed below, “Cited as Work(s) in Progress’,
  explain the design Specification for the development of the
  IPtX (IP Telecommunications Specification) Protocol Addressing
  System and the correction of the Mathematical Error in the
  Binary System.
