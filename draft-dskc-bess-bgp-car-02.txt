1.  Introduction

   This document specifies a new BGP SAFI called BGP Color-Aware Routing
   (BGP CAR).  BGP CAR fulfills the transport and VPN problem statement
   and requirements described in [dskc-bess-bgp-car-problem-statement].

1.2.  Illustration

   Here is a brief illustration of the salient properties of the BGP CAR
   solution.

   |             |      |             |      |             | V/v with C1
   |----+        |------|             |------|        +----|/
   | E1 |        |      |             |      |        | E2 |\
   |----+        |      |             |      |        +----| W/w with C2
   |             |------|             |------|             |
   |  Domain 1   |      |   Domain 2  |      |   Domain 3  |
   +-------------+      +-------------+      +-------------+


                                 Figure 1

   All the nodes are part of an interdomain network under a single
   authority and with a consistent color-to-intent mapping:

   o  C1 is mapped to "low-delay"

      *  Flex-Algo FA1 is mapped to "low delay" and hence to C1

   o  C2 is mapped to "low-delay and avoid resource R"

      *  Flex-Algo FA2 is mapped to "low delay and avoid resource R" and
         hence C2

   E1 receives two service routes from E2:

   o  V/v with BGP Extended-Color community C1

   o  W/w with BGP Extended-Color community C2

   E1 has the following color-aware paths:

   o  (E2, C1) provided by BGP CAR with the following per-domain
      support:

      *  Domain1: over IGP FA1

      *  Domain2: over SR Policy bound to color C1

      *  Domain3: over IGP FA1

   o  (E2, C2) provided by SR Policy

   E1 automatically steers the received service routes as follows:

   o  V/v via (E2, C1) provided by BGP CAR

   o  W/w via (E2, C2) provided by SR Policy

   Illustrated Properties:

   o  Leverage of the BGP Color Extended-Community

      *  The service routes are colored with widely-used BGP Extended-
         Color Community

   o  (E, C) Automated Steering

      *  V/v and W/w are automatically steered on the appropriate color-
         aware path

   o  Seamless co-existence of BGP CAR and SR Policy

      *  V/v is steered on BGP CAR color-aware path

      *  W/w is steered on SR Policy color-aware path

   o  Seamless interworking of BGP CAR and SR Policy

      *  V/v is steered on a BGP CAR color-aware path that is itself
         resolved within domain 2 onto an SR Policy bound to the color
         of V/v

   Other properties:

   o  MPLS dataplane: with 300k PE's and 5 colors, the BGP CAR solution
      ensures that no single node needs to support a dataplane scaling
      in the order of Remote PE * C.  This would otherwise blow the MPLS
      dataplane.

   o  Control-Plane: a node should not install a (E, C) path if it does
      not need it

   o  Incongruent Color-Intent mapping: the solution supports the
      signaling of a BGP CAR route across different color domains

   The keys to this simplicity are:

      routing solution: SR Policy, IGP Flex-Algo.

1.3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  BGP CAR SAFI

2.1.  Data Model

   The BGP CAR data model is:

   o  NLRI Key: IP Prefix, Color

   o  NLRI non-key encapsulation data: MPLS label stack, Label index,
      SRv6 SID list etc.

   o  BGP Next Hop

   o  AIGP Metric: accumulates color/intent specific metric across
      domains

   o  Local-Color-Mapping Extended-Community (LCM-EC): Optional 32-bit
      Color value used when a CAR route propagates between different
      color domains

2.2.  Extensible encoding

   Extensible encoding is ensured by:

Internet-Draft        BGP Color-Aware Routing (CAR)             May 2021


   o  NLRI Route-Type field: provides extensibility to add new NLRI
      formats for new route-types

   o  Key length: field enables handling of unsupported route-types
      opaquely, enabling transitivity via RRs

   o  TLV-based encoding of non-key NLRI: enables support for multiple
      encapsulations with efficient update packing

   o  AIGP Attribute provides extensibility via TLVs, enabling
      definition of additional metric semantics for a color as needed
      for an intent

2.3.  BGP CAR Route Origination

   A BGP CAR route may be originated locally (e.g., loopback) or through
   redistribution of an (E, C) color-aware path provided by another
   routing solution: SR Policy, IGP Flex-Algo or BGP-LU [RFC8277].

2.4.  BGP CAR Route Validation

   A BGP CAR path (E, C) from N with encapsulation T is valid if color-
   aware path (N, C) exists and T is dataplane available.

   A local policy may customize the validation process:

   o  the color constraint in the first check may be relaxed: instead N
      is reachable in the default routing table

   o  the dataplane availability constraint of T may be relaxed

   o  addition of a performance-measurement verification to ensure that
      the intent associated with C is met (e.g. delay < bound)

2.5.  BGP CAR Route Resolution

   A BGP color-aware route (E2, C1) from N is resolved over a color-
   aware route (N, C1).  The color-aware route (N, C1) may be provided
   recursively by BGP CAR or by other routing solutions: SR Policy, IGP
   Flex-Algo, BGP-LU.

   When multiple resolutions are possible, the default preference should
   be: IGP Flex-Algo, SR Policy, BGP CAR, BGP LU.

   Through local policy, a BGP color-aware route (E2, C1) from N may be
   resolved over a color-aware route (N, C2): i.e. the local policy maps
   the resolution of C1 over C2.  For example, in a domain where
   resource R is known to not be present, the inter-domain intent

Internet-Draft        BGP Color-Aware Routing (CAR)             May 2021


   C1="low delay and avoid R" may be resolved over an intra-domain path
   of intent C2="low delay".

   The color-aware route (N, C1) may have a different dataplane
   encapsulation than the one of (E2, C1): e.g. a BGP CAR route (E2, C1)
   with SR-MPLS encapsulation may be transported over an intermediate
   SRv6 domain.

2.6.  AIGP Metric Computation

   The Accumulated IGP (AIGP) Attribute is updated as the BGP CAR route
   propagates across the network.

   The value set (or appropriately incremented) in the AIGP TLV
   corresponds to the metric associated with the underlying intent of
   the color.  For example, when the color is associated with a low-
   latency path, the metric value is set based on the delay metric.

   Information regarding the metric type used by the underlying intra-
   domain mechanism can also be set.

   If BGP CAR routes traverse across a discontinuity in the transport
   path for a given intent, add a penalty in accumulated IGP metric.
   The discontinuity is also indicated to upstream nodes via a bit in
   the AIGP TLV.

   AIGP metric computation is recursive.

   To avoid continuous IGP metric churn causing end to end BGP CAR
   churn, an implementation should provide thresholds to trigger AIGP
   update.

   Additional AIGP extensions may be defined to signal state for
   specific use-cases: MSD along the BGP CAR advertisement, Minimum MTU
   along the BGP CAR advertisement.

2.7.  Path Availability

   The (E, C) route inherently provides availability of redundant paths
   at every hop.  For instance, BGP CAR routes originated by two egress
   ABRs in a domain are advertised as multiple paths to ingress ABRs in
   the domain, where they become equal-cost or primary-backup paths.  A
   failure of an egress ABR is detected and handled by ingress ABRs
   locally within the domain for faster convergence, without any
   necessity to propagate the event to upstream nodes for traffic
   restoration.

   BGP ADD-PATH should be enabled for BGP CAR to signal multiple next
   hops through a transport RR.

2.8.  BGP CAR signaling through different color domains

             [Color Domain 1   A]-----[B     Color Domain 2     E2]
             [C1=low-delay      ]     [C2=low-delay               ]

   Let us assume a BGP CAR route (E2, C2) is signaled from B to A; two
   border routers of respectively domain 2 and domain 1.  Let us assume
   that these two domains do not share the same color-to-intent mapping.
   Low-delay in domain 2 is color C2 while C1 in domain 1 (C1 <> C2).

   The BGP CAR solution seamlessly supports this (rare) scenario while
   maintaining the separation and independence of the administrative
   authority in different color domains.

   The solution works as follows:

   o  Within domain 2, the BGP CAR route is (E2, C2) via E2

   o  B signals to A the BGP CAR route as (E2, C2) via B with Local-
      Color-Mapping-Extended-Community (LCM-EC) of color C2

   o  A is aware (classic peering agreement) of the intent-to-color
      mapping within domain 2 ("low-delay" in domain 2 is C2)

   o  A maps C2 in LCM-EC to C1 and signals within domain 1 the received
      BGP CAR route as (E2, C2) via A with LCM-EC(C1)

   o  The nodes within the receiving domain 1 use the local color
      encoded in the LCM-EC for next-hop resolution and BGP CAR route
      installation

   Salient properties:

   o  The NLRI never changes

   o  E is globally unique, which makes E-C in that order unique

   o  In the vast majority of the case, the color of the NLRI is used
      for resolution and steering

   o  In the rare case of color incongruence, the local color encoded in
      LCM-EC takes precedence

   Further illustrations are provided in Appendix B.

2.9.  Format and Encoding

   BGP CAR leverages the BGP multi-protocol extensions [RFC4760] and
   uses the MP_REACH_NLRI and MP_UNREACH_NLRI attributes for route
   updates by using the SAFI value TBD1 along with AFI 1 for IPv4
   prefixes and AFI 2 for IPv6 prefixes.

   BGP speakers MUST use BGP Capabilities Advertisement to ensure
   support for processing of BGP CAR updates.  This is done as specified
   in [RFC4760], by using capability code 1 (multi-protocol BGP), with
   AFI 1 and 2 (as required) and SAFI TBD1.

   The sub-sections below specify the generic encoding of the BGP CAR
   NLRI followed by the encoding for specific NLRI types introduced in
   this document.

2.9.1.  BGP CAR SAFI NLRI Format

   The generic format for the BGP CAR SAFI NLRI is shown below:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   |           Type-specific Non-Key Fields (if applicable)       //
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   where:

   o  NLRI Length: 1 octet field that indicates the length in octets of
      the NLRI excluding the NLRI Length field itself.

   o  Key Length: 1 octet field that indicates the length in octets of
      the NLRI type-specific key fields.  Key length MUST be at least 2
      less than the NLRI length.

   o  NLRI Type: 1 octet field that indicates the type of the BGP CAR
      NLRI.

   o  Type-Specific Key Fields: Depend on the NLRI type and of length
      indicated by the Key Length.

   o  Type-Specific Non-Key Fields: optional and variable depending on
      the NLRI type.  The NLRI encoding allows for encoding of specific

      non-key information associated with the route (i.e. the key) as
      part of the NLRI for efficient packing of BGP updates.

   The indication of the key length enables BGP Speakers to determine
   the key portion of the NLRI and use it along with the NLRI Type field
   in an opaque manner for handling of unknown or unsupported NLRI
   types.  This can help Route Reflectors (RR) to propagate NLRI types
   introduced in the future in a transparent manner.

   The NLRI encoding allows for encoding of specific non-key information
   associated with the route (i.e. the key) as part of the NLRI for
   efficient packing of BGP updates.

   The non-key portion of the NLRI MUST be omitted while carrying it
   within the MP_UNREACH_NLRI when withdrawing the route advertisement.

2.9.2.  CAR NLRI Type

   The Color-Aware Routes NLRI Type is used for advertisement of color-
   aware routes and has the following format:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   where:

   o  NLRI Length: variable

   o  Key Length: variable

   o  NLRI Type: 1

   o  Type-Specific Key Fields: as below

      *  Prefix Length: 1 octet field that carries the length of prefix
         in bits.  Length MUST be less than or equal to 32 for IPv4
         (AFI=1) and less than or equal to 128 for IPv6 (AFI=2).

      *  IP Prefix: IPv4 or IPv6 prefix (based on the AFI).  A variable
         size field that contains the most significant octets of the
         prefix, i.e., 1 octet for prefix length 1 to 8, 2 octets for
         prefix length 9 to 16, 3 octets for prefix length 17 up to 24,
         4 octets for prefix length 25 up to 32, and so on.  The size of
         the field MUST be less than or equal to 4 for IPv4 (AFI=1) and
         less than or equal to 16 for IPv6 (AFI=2).

      *  Color: 4 octets that contains color value associated with the
         prefix.

   o  Type-Specific Non-Key Fields: specified in the form of optional
      TLVs as below:

      *  Type: 1 octet field that contains the type of the non-key TLV

      *  Length: 1 octet field that contains the length of the value
         portion of the non-key TLV in terms of octets

      *  Value: variable length field as indicated by the length field
         and to be interpreted as per the type field.

   The prefix is routable across the administrative domain where BGP
   transport CAR is deployed.  It is possible that the same prefix is
   originated by multiple BGP CAR speakers in the case of anycast
   addressing or multi-homing.

   The Color is introduced to enable multiple route advertisements for
   the same prefix.  The color is associated with an intent (e.g. low-
   latency) in originator color-domain.

   The following sub-sections specify the non-key TLVs associated with
   the Color-Aware Routes NLRI type.

2.9.2.1.  Label TLV

   The Label TLV is used for advertisement of color-aware routes along
   with their MPLS labels and has the following format:

   Followed by one (or more) Labels encoded as below:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                 Label                 |Rsrv |S|
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   where:

   o  Type : 1

   o  Length: variable, MUST be a multiple of 3

   o  Label Information: multiples of 3 octet fields to convey the MPLS
      label(s) associated with the advertised color-aware route.  It is
      used for encoding a single label or a stack of labels as per
      procedures specified in [RFC8277].

   When a BGP transport CAR speaker is propagating the route further
   after setting itself as the nexthop, it allocates a local label for
   the specific prefix and color combination which it updates in this
   TLV.  It also MUST program a label cross-connect that would result in
   the label swap operation for the incoming label that it advertises
   with the label received from its best-path router(s).

2.9.2.2.  Label Index TLV

   The Label Index TLV is used for advertisement of Segment Routing MPLS
   (SR-MPLS) Segment Identifier (SID) [RFC8402] information associated
   with the labeled color-aware routes and has the following format:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   o  Type : 2

   o  Length: 7

   o  Reserved: 1 octet field that MUST be set to 0 and ignored on
      receipt.

   o  Flags: 2 octet field that maps to the Flags field of the Label-
      Index TLV of the BGP Prefix SID Attribute [RFC8277].

   o  Label Index: 4 octet field that maps to the Label Index field of
      the Label-Index TLV of the BGP Prefix SID Attribute [RFC8277].

   This TLV provides the equivalent functionality as Label-Index TLV of
   [RFC8669] for Transport CAR in SR-MPLS deployments.  The BGP Prefix
   SID Attribute SHOULD be omitted from the labeled color-aware routes
   when the attribute is being used to only convey the Label Index TLV
   for better BGP packing efficiency.

   When a BGP Transport CAR speaker is propagating the route further
   after setting itself as the nexthop, it allocates a local label for
   the specific prefix and color combination.  When the received update
   has the Label Index TLV, it SHOULD use that hint to allocate the
   local label from the SR Global Block (SRGB) using procedures as
   specified in [RFC8669].

2.9.2.3.  SRv6 SID TLV

   BGP Transport CAR can be also used to setup end-to-end color-aware
   connectivity using Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) [RFC8402].
   [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming] specifies the SRv6
   Endpoint behaviors (e.g.  End PSP) which MAY be leveraged for BGP CAR
   with SRv6.The SRv6 SID TLV is used for advertisement of color-aware
   routes along with their SRv6 SIDs and has the following format:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   o  Type : 3

   o  Length: variable, MUST be either less than or equal to 16, or be a
      multiple of 16

   o  SRv6 SID Information: field of size as indicated by the length
      that either carries the SRv6 SID(s) for the advertised color-aware
      route as one of the following:

      *  A single 128-bit SRv6 SID or a stack of 128-bit SRv6 SIDs

      *  A transposed portion (refer [I-D.ietf-bess-srv6-services]) of
         the SRv6 SID that MUST be of size in multiples of one octet and
         less than 16.

   The BGP color-aware route update for SRv6 MUST include the BGP
   Prefix-SID attribute along with the TLV carrying the SRv6 SID
   information as specified in [I-D.ietf-bess-srv6-services] when using
   the transposition scheme of encoding for packing efficiency of BGP
   updates.

2.9.3.  Local-Color-Mapping (LCM) Extended Community

   This document defines a new BGP Extended Community called "LCM".  The
   LCM is a Transitive Opaque Extended Community with the following
   encoding:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |     Type=0x3  | Sub-Type=TBD2 |          Reserved             |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                             Color                             |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   where:

   o  Type: 0x3

   o  Sub-Type: TBD2.

   o  Reserved: 2 octet of reserved field that MUST be set to zero on
      transmission and ignored on reception.

   o  Color: 4-octet field that carries the 32-bit color value.

   When a CAR route crosses the originator color domain's boundary, LCM
   EC is added.  LCM EC conveys the local color mapping for the intent
   (e.g. low latency) into transit or remote color domains.

   The LCM EC MAY be used for filtering of BGP CAR routes and/or for
   applying routing policies for the intent, when present.

2.10.  Fault Handling

   This the fault management actions as described in [RFC7606] are
   applicable for handling of BGP update messages for BGP-CAR.

   When the error determined allows for the router to skip the malformed
   NLRI(s) and continue processing of the rest of the update message,
   then it MUST handle such malformed NLRIs as 'Treat-as-withdraw'.  In
   other cases, where the error in the NLRI encoding results in the
   inability to process the BGP update message (e.g. length related
   encoding errors), then the router SHOULD handle such malformed NLRIs
   as 'AFI/SAFI disable' when other AFI/SAFI besides BGP-CAR are being
   advertised over the same session.  Alternately, the router MUST
   perform 'session reset' when the session is only being used for BGP-
   CAR.

3.  Service route Automated Steering on Color-Aware path

   E1 automatically steers a C-colored service route V/v from E2 onto an
   (E2, C) color-aware path.  If several such paths exist, a preference
   scheme is used to select the best path: E.g.  IGP Flex-Algo first
   then BGP CAR then SR Policy.

   This is consistent with the automated service route steering on SR
   Policy (a routing solution providing color-aware path) defined in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].  All the steering
   variations defined in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] are
   applicable to BGP CAR color-aware path: on-demand steering, per-
   destination, per-flow, CO-only.  For brevity, in this revision, we
   refer the reader to the [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy]
   text.

   Salient property: Seamless integration of BGP CAR and SR Policy.

   Appendix A provides illustrations of service route automated
   steering.

4.  Intents

   The widely deployed color-aware path SR Policy solution demonstrates
   that the following intents can easily be associated with a color:

   1.  Minimization of a cost metric vs a latency metric

       *  Minimization of different metric types, static and dynamic

   2.  Exclusion/Inclusion of SRLG and/or Link Affinity and/or minimum
       MTU/number of hops

   3.  Bandwidth management

   4.  In the inter-domain context, exclusion/inclusion of entire
       domains, and border routers

   5.  Inclusion of one or several virtual network function chains

       *  Located in a regional domain and/or core domain, in a DC

   6.  Localization of the virtual network function chains

       *  Some functions may be desired in the regional DC or vice versa

   7.  Per-Destination and Per-Flow steering

   It is straightforward to note that the BGP CAR color-aware
   alternative supports intents 1, 2, 4 and 7.

   Future revisions of this document will analyze the BGP CAR supports
   for 3, 5 and 6.

5.  (E, C) Subscription and Filtering

   This section defines an (E, C) BGP subscription model that allows to
   filter the (E, C) routes learned by a BGP CAR node.

5.1.  Illustration

        E1-----------------A-------------------B-------------------E2
                                                <--- (E2, C1) ----
         -- F (E2, C1) -->   --- F (E2, C1) -->
                           |                   |
         <-- (E2, C1) ----   <--- (E2, C1) ----

   o  BGP CAR route (E2, C1) advertised by E2 is not unconditionally
      distributed beyond a certain point (e.g., B)

   o  E1 subscribes to (E2, C1) by advertising a filter route F (E2, C1)
      to its upstream peer A

   o  If A has (E2, C1) in its BGP RIB, it will advertise (E2, C1) to E1

   o  If A does not have (E2, C1), it will advertise F (E2, C1) to its
      peer B

   o  B will advertise (E2, C1) to A, which will distribute it to E1

   E1 may trigger a subscription for BGP CAR route (E2, C1) as a result
   of receiving a C1-colored service route V/v from E2, for on-demand
   steering via (E2, C1).

6.  Scaling

   This section analyses the key scale requirement of [ref:dskc-bess-
   bgp-car-problem-statement], specifically:

   o  No intermediate node dataplane should need to scale to (Colors *
      PEs)

   o  No node should learn and install a BGP CAR route to (E,C) if it
      does not install a Colored service route to E

   Figure 2 provides an ultra-scale reference topology.  Section 6.2
   presents three design models to deploy BGP CAR in the reference
   topology.  Section 6.3 analyses the scaling properties of each model.
   Section 6.4 illustrates the scaling benefits of the (E, C) BGP
   subscription and filtering.

   The following applies to the reference topology above:

   o  Independent ISIS/OSPF SR instance in each domain.

   o  Each domain has Flex Algo 128.  Prefix SID for a node is SRGB
      168000 plus node number.

   o  A BGP CAR route (E2, C1) is advertised by egress BRM node 451.The
      route is sourced locally from redistribution from IGP-FA 128.

   o  Not shown for simplicity, node 452 will also advertise (E2, C1).

   o  When a transport RR is used within the domain or across domains,
      ADD-PATH is enabled to advertise paths from both egress BRs to
      it's clients.

   o  Egress PE E2 advertises a VPN route RD:V/v with BGP Color extended
      community C1 that propagates via service RRs to ingress PE E1.

   o  E1 steers V/v prefix via color-aware path (E2,C1) and VPN label
      30030

   2.   Each BGP hop allocates local label and programs swap entry in
        forwarding for (451, C1)

   3.   121 resolves received BGP CAR route (451, C1) via 231 (label
        168451) on color-aware path (231, C1)

        1.  Color-aware path (231, C1) is FA128 path to 231 (label
            168231)

   4.   451 advertises BGP CAR route (E2, C1) via 451 to Transport RR
        T-RR2, which reflects it to T-RR1, which reflects it to 121

   5.   121 receives BGP CAR route (E2, C1) via 451 with label 168002

        1.  Let's assume 121 selects that path

   6.   121 resolves BGP CAR route (E2, C1) via 451 on color-aware path
        (451, C1)

        1.  Color-aware path (451, C1) is BGP CAR path to 451 (label
            168451)

   7.   121 imposition of color-aware label stack for (E2, C1) is thus

        1.  168002 <=> (E2, C1)

        2.  168451 <=> (451, C1)

        3.  168231 <=> (231, C1)

   8.   121 advertises (E2, C1) to E1 with next hop self (121) and label
        168002

   9.   E1 constructs same imposition color-aware label-stack for V/v
        via (E2, C1) as in the flat model:

        1.  30030 <=> V/v

        3.  168121 <=> (121, C1)

  -----+---------------------+---------------------+--------------------

   o  The flat model is the simplest design, with a single BGP transport
      level.  It results in the minimum label/SID stack at each BGP hop.
      However, it significantly increases the scale impact on the core
      BRs (e.g. 341), whose FIB capacity and even MPLS label space may
      be exceeded.

      *  341's dataplane scales with (E2,C) where there may be 300k E's
         and 5 C's hence 1.5M entries > 1M MPLS dataplane

   o  The hierarchical models avoid the need for core BRs to learn
      routes and install label forwarding entries for (E, C) routes.

      *  Whether NH self or unchanged at 121, 341's dataplane scales
         with (451,C) where there may be thousands of 451's and 5 C's
         hence well under the 1M MPLS dataplane

   o  The next-hop-self option at ingress BRM (e.g. 121) hides the
      hierarchical design from the ingress PE, keeping its outgoing
      label programming as simple as the flat model.  However, the
      ingress BRM requires an additional BGP transport level recursion,
      which coupled with load-balancing adds dataplane complexity.  It

      needs to support a swap and push operation.  It also needs to
      install label forwarding entries for the egress PEs that are of
      interest to its local ingress PEs.

   o  With the next-hop-unchanged option at ingress BRM (e.g. 121), only
      an ingress PE needs to learn and install output label entries for
      egress (E, C) routes.  The ingress BRM only installs label
      forwarding entries for the egress ABR (e.g. 451).  However, the
      ingress PE needs an additional BGP transport level recursion and
      pushes a BGP VPN label and two BGP transport labels.  It may also
      need to handle load-balancing for the egress ABRs.  This is the
      most complex dataplane option for the ingress PE.

6.4.  Scaling Benefits of the (E, C) BGP Subscription and Filtering

   The (E, C) subscription scheme from Section 5 provides the following
   scaling benefits for the models in Section 6.2

   o  An ingress PE (E1) only learns (E, C) routes that it needs to
      install into data plane for service route automated steering

   o  An ingress BRM (121) only learns (E, C) routes that it needs to
      install into data plane (for Next-Hop-Self), or that it needs to
      distribute towards it's ingress PEs (inline RR with Next-Hop-
      Unchanged)

   o  An ingress BRM or a transport RR only needs to distribute the
      necessary subset of (E, C) routes to each client (subscriber);
      this minimizes their processing load for generating updates

   o  As a result, withdrawal of (E, C) routes when a remote node fails
      (E2), may also be faster, aiding better convergence

6.5.  Anycast SID

   This section describes how Anycast SID complements and improves the
   scaling designs above.

6.5.1.  Anycast SID for transit inter-domain nodes

   o  Redundant BRs (e.g. two egress BRMs, 451 and 452) advertise BGP
      CAR routes for a local PE (e.g., E2) with the same SID (based on
      label-index).  Such egress BRMs may be assigned a common Anycast
      SID, so that the BGP next-hops for these routes will also resolve
      via a color-aware path to the Anycast SID.

   o  The use of Anycast SID naturally provides fast local convergence
      upon failure of an egress BRM node.  In addition, it decreases the

      recursive resolution and load-balancing complexity at an ingress
      BRM or PE in the hierarchical designs above.

6.5.2.  Anycast SID for transport color endpoints (e.g., PEs)

   The common Anycast SID technique may also be used for a redundant
   pair of PEs that share an identical set of service (VPN) attachments.

   o  For example, assume a node E2' paired with E2 above.  Both PEs
      should be configured with the same static label/SID for the
      services (e.g., per-VRF VPN label/SID), and will advertise
      associated service routes with the Anycast IP as BGP next-hop.

   o  This design provides a convergence and recursive resolution
      benefit on an ingress PE or ABR similar to the egress ABR case
      above.

7.  Routing Convergence

   This section will analyze routing convergence.

8.  VPN CAR

   This section illustrates the extension of BGP CAR to address the VPN
   CAR requirement stated in Section 3.2 of [dskc-bess-bgp-car-problem-
   statement].

   5.   PE1 sends to CE1     : [(V, CC), L3]        via PE1        without any LCM

   6.a. Label L3 is installed as the imposition label for (V, CC)

   VPN CAR distribution for (RD, V, CC) requires a new SAFI that follows
   same VPN semantics as defined in [RFC4364], the difference being that
   the advertised routes carry CAR NLRI defined in Section 2.9.2 of this

9.3.  Guidance for Designated Experts

   In all cases of review by the Designated Expert (DE) described here,
   the DE is expected to ascertain the existence of suitable
   documentation (a specification) as described in [RFC8126].  The DE is
   also expected to check the clarity of purpose and use of the
   requested code points.  Additionally, the DE must verify that any
   request for one of these code points has been made available for
   review and comment within the IETF: the DE will post the request to
   the IDR Working Group mailing list (or a successor mailing list
   designated by the IESG).  If the request comes from within the IETF,
   it should be documented in an Internet-Draft.  Lastly, the DE must
   ensure that any other request for a code point does not conflict with
   work that is active or already published within the IETF.

9.4.  BGP Extended Community Registry

   IANA is requested to allocate the sub-type TBD2 for "Local Color
   Mapping (LCM)" under the "BGP Transitive Opaque Extended Community"
   registry under the "BGP Extended Community" parameter registry.

Appendix A.  Illustrations of Service Steering

   The following sub-sections illustrate example scenarios of Colored
   Service Route Steering over E2E BGP CAR resolving over different
   intra-domain mechanisms

   The examples use MPLS/SR for the transport data plane.  Scenarios
   specific to other encapsulations will be added in subsequent
   versions.

   o  With reference to the topology above:

      *  IGP FA 128 is running in each domain.

      *  Egress PE E2 advertises a VPN route RD:V/v colored with (color
         extended community) C1 to steer traffic to BGP transport CAR
         (E2, C1).  VPN route propagates via service RRs to ingress PE

      *  BGP CAR route (E2, C1) with next-hop, label-index and label as
         shown above are advertised through border routers in each
         domain.  When a RR is used in the domain, ADD-PATH is enabled
         to advertise multiple available paths.

      *  Local policy on each hop maps intent C1 to resolve CAR route
         next-hop over IGP FA 128 of the domain.  AIGP attribute
         influences BGP CAR route best path decision as per [RFC7311].
         BGP CAR label swap entry is installed that goes over FA 128 LSP
         to next-hop providing intent in each IGP domain.  Update AIGP
         metric to reflect FA 128 metric to next-hop.

      *  Ingress PE E1 learns CAR route (E2, C1).  It steers colored VPN
         route RD:V/v into (E2, C1)

   o  Important:

      *  IGP FA 128 top label provides intent in each domain.

      *  BGP CAR label (e.g. 168002) carries end to end intent.  Thus
         stitches intent over intra domain FA 128.

             Figure 8: BGP Hybrid FA Aware transport CAR path

   Use case: Provide intent for service flows only in Core domain.

   o  With reference to the topology above:

      *  IGP FA 128 is only enabled in Core (e.g.  WAN network).  Access
         only has base algo 0.

      *  Egress PE E2 advertises a VPN route RD:V/v colored with (color
         extended community) C1 to steer traffic to BGP transport CAR

         (E2, C1).  VPN route propagates via service RRs to ingress PE
         E1.

      *  BGP CAR route (E2, C1) with next-hop, label-index and label as
         shown above are advertised through border routers in each
         domain.  When a RR is used in the domain, ADD-PATH is enabled
         to advertise multiple available paths.

      *  Local policy on 231 and 232 maps intent C1 to resolve CAR route
         next-hop over IGP base algo 0 in right access domain.  BGP CAR
         label swap entry is installed that goes over algo 0 LSP to
         next-hop.  Update AIGP metric to reflect algo 0 metric to next-
         hop with an additional penalty.

      *  Local policy on 121 and 122 maps intent C1 to resolve CAR route
         next-hop learnt from Core domain over IGP FA 128.  BGP CAR
         label swap entry is installed that goes over FA 128 LSP to
         next-hop providing intent in Core IGP domain.

      *  Ingress PE E1 learns CAR route (E2, C1).  It maps intent C1 to
         resolve CAR route next-hop over IGP base algo 0.  It steers
         colored VPN route RD:V/v into (E2, C1)

   o  Important:

      *  IGP FA 128 top label provides intent in Core domain.

      *  BGP CAR label (e.g. 168002) carries intent from PEs which is
         realized in core domain

A.4.  Transit network domains that do not support CAR

   o  In a brownfield deployment, color-aware paths between two PEs may
      need to go through a transit domain that does not support CAR.
      Example include an MPLS LDP network with IGP best-effort; or a
      BGP-LU based multi-domain network.  MPLS LDP network with best
      effort IGP can adopt above scheme.  Below is the example for BGP
      LU.

   o  Reference topology:

   E1 --- BR1 --- BR2 ......... BR3 ---- BR4 --- E2
       Ci           <----LU---->              Ci

      *  Network between BR2 and BR3 comprises of multiple BGP-LU hops
         (over IGP-LDP domains).

      *  E1, BR1, BR4 and E2 are enabled for BGP CAR, with Ci colors

      *  BR1 and BR2 are directly connected; BR3 and BR4 are directly
         connected

   o  BR1 and BR4 form an over-the-top peering (via RRs as needed) to
      exchange BGP CAR routes

   o  BR1 and BR4 also form direct BGP-LU sessions to BR2 and BR3
      respectively, to establish labeled paths between each other
      through the BGP-LU network

   o  BR1 recursively resolves the BGP CAR next-hop for CAR routes
      learnt from BR4 via the BGP-LU path to BR4

   o  BR1 signals the transport discontinuity to E1 via the AIGP TLV, so
      that E1 can prefer other paths if available

   o  BR4 does the same in the reverse direction

   o  Thus, the color-awareness of the routes and hence the paths in the
      data plane are maintained between E1 and E2, even if the intent is
      not available within the BGP-LU island

   o  A similar design can be used for going over network islands of
      other types

Appendix B.  Color Mapping Illustrations

   There are a variety of deployment scenarios that arise w.r.t
   different color mappings in an inter-domain environment.  This
   section attempts to enumerate them and provide clarity into the usage
   of the color related protocol constructs.

B.1.  Single color domain containing network domains with N:N color
      distribution

   o  All network domains (ingress, egress and all transit domains) are
      enabled for the same N colors.

      *  A color may of course be realized by different technologies in
         different domains as described above.

   o  The N intents are both signaled end-to-end via BGP CAR routes; as
      well as realized in the data plane.

   o  Appendix A.1 is an example of this case.

B.2.  Single color domain containing network domains with N:M color
      distribution

   o  Certain network domains may not be enabled for some of the colors,
      but may still be required to provide transit.

   o  When a (E, C) route traverses a domain where color C is not
      available, the operator may decide to use a different intent of
      color c that is available in that domain to resolve the next-hop
      and establish a path through the domain.

      *  The next-hop resolution may occur via paths of any intra-domain
         protocol or even via paths provided by BGP CAR.

      *  The next-hop resolution color c may be defined as a local
         policy at ingress or transit nodes of the domain.

      *  It may also be automatically signaled from egress border nodes
         by attaching a color extended community with value c to the BGP
         CAR routes.

   o  Hence, routes of N colors may be resolved via a smaller set of M
      colored paths in a transit domain, while preserving the original
      color-awareness end-to-end.

   o  Any ingress PE that installs a service (VPN) route with a color C,
      must have C enabled locally to install IP routes to (E, C) and
      resolve the service route next-hop.

   o  A degenerate variation of this scenario is where a transit domain
      does not support any color.  Appendix A.3 describes an example of
      this case.

B.3.  Multiple color domains

   When the routes are distributed between domains with different color-
   to-intent mapping schemes, both N:N and N:M cases are possible,
   although an N:M mapping is more likely to occur.

   Reference topology:

      D1 ----- D2 ----- D3
      C1       C2       C3

   o  C1 in D1 maps to C2 in D2 and to C3 in D3

   o  BGP CAR is enabled in all three domains

Internet-Draft        BGP Color-Aware Routing (CAR)             May 2021


   The reference topology above is used to elaborate on the design
   described in Section 2.8

   When the route originates in color domain D1 and gets advertised to a
   different color domain D2, following procedures apply:

   o  The original intent in the BGP CAR route is preserved; i.e. route
      is (E, C1)

   o  A BR of D1 attaches LCM-EC with value C1 when advertising to a BR
      in D2

   o  A BR in D2 receiving (E, C1) maps C1 in received LCM-EC to local
      color, say C2

   o  Within D2, this LCM-EC value of C2 is used instead of the Color in
      CAR route NLRI (E, C1).  This applies to all procedures described
      in the earlier section for a single color domain, such as next-hop
      resolution and installation of route and forwarding entries.

   o  A colored service route V/v originated in domain D1 with next-hop
      E and color C1 will also have its color extended-community value
      re-mapped to C2, typically at a service RR

   o  On an ingress PE in D2, V/v will resolve via C2

   o  When a BR in D2 advertises the route to a BR in D3, the same
      process repeats.
