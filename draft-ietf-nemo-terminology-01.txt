Abstract

   This document defines a terminology for discussing network mobility
   problems and solution requirements. Network mobility arises when a
   router connecting an entire network to the Internet dynamically
   changes its point of attachment to the Internet therefrom causing the
   reachability of the entire network to be changed in the topology.
   Such kind of network is referred to as a mobile network. Without
   appropriate mechanisms, sessions established between nodes in the
   mobile network and the global Internet cannot be maintained while the
   mobile router changes its point of attachment.

Internet-Draft              NEMO Terminology               February 2004


1. Introduction

   Network mobility support is concerned with managing the mobility of
   an entire network which changes its point of attachment to the
   Internet and thus its reachability in the Internet topology. If
   network mobility is not explicitly supported by some mechanisms,
   existing sessions break and connectivity to the global Internet is
   lost.

   This document defines the specific terminology needed to describe the
   problem space we face with network mobility and to edict the
   solutions and the requirements they must comply with. This
   terminology complies with the usual IPv6 terminology [7] and the
   generic mobility-related terms already defined in [2] and in the
   Mobile IPv6 [1] specifications. Some terms introduced in the present
   version of the draft may only be useful for the purpose of defining
   the problem scope and functional requirements of network mobility
   support and shall be removed or refined once we agree on the
   requirements.

   The first section introduces terms to define the architecture
   components; the second introduces terms to discuss the requirements,
   the third, terms to discuss nested mobility; the forth defines
   multihoming, and the last, miscellaneous terms which do not fit in
   either sections. The overall terminology is summarized in fig.1 to 5.
   Fig.1 shows a single mobile subnetwork. Fig.2. shows a larger mobile
   network comprising several subnetworks, attached on a foreign link.
   Fig.3 illustrates a node changing its point of attachment within the
   mobile network. Fig.4 and 5 illustrate nested mobility whereas Fig.6
   to Fig.8 illustrate multihoming.

2. Architecture Components

   Fig.1 and 2 illustrate the architecture components involved in
   network mobility. The terms "Fixed Node (FN)", "Mobile Node (MN)",
   "Mobile Network", "Mobile Router (MR)", "Mobile Network Node (MNN)",
   "home link", "foreign link", "ingress interface", "egress interface",
   access router (AR), home link, foreign link are defined in [2].

   A mobile network is composed by one or more IP-subnet and is viewed
   as a single unit. It is connected to the Internet by means of mobile
   routers (MRs). Nodes behind the MR primarily comprise fixed nodes
   (nodes unable to change their point of attachment while maintaining
   ongoing sessions), and additionally mobile nodes (nodes able to
   change their point of attachment while maintaining ongoing sessions).
   In most cases, the internal structure of the mobile network will in
   effect be relatively stable (no dynamic change of the topology), but
   this is not a general assumption.

   Fig.1: Architecture Components


   At the network layer, MRs get access to the global Internet from the
   Access Routers (ARs) on the visited link. The MR maintains the
   Internet connectivity for the entire mobile network. It has one or
   more egress interface(s) and one or more ingress interface(s). When
   forwarding a packet to the Internet the packet is transmitted
   upstream through one of the MR's egress interfaces to the AR; when
   forwarding a packet from the AR down to the mobile network, the
   packet is transmitted downstream through one of the MR's ingress
   interfaces.

   Within the term Mobile Network Node (MNN), we can distinguish between
   LFN, VMN and LMN. The distinction is a property of how different
   types of nodes can move in the topology and is necessary to discuss
   issues related to mobility management and access control, but does
   not preclude that mobility should be handled differently. Nodes are
   classified according to their function and capabilities with the
   rationale that nodes with different properties (may) have different
   requirements.

3.1 Mobile Network

   As defined in [2])

3.2 NEMO

   An abbreviation either for "NEtwork MObility" or for " a NEtwork that
   is MObile". It the former, it refers to the concept of "network
   mobility" like in "NEMO Basic Support" and is also the working
   group's name. In the latter, it is used as a noun, e.g. "a NEMO"
   meaning "a mobile network".

   topologically with respect to the MR and whose home link doesn't
   belong to the mobile network. A VMN that gets temporarily attached to
   a NEMO-link (used as a foreign link) obtains an address on that link
   (i.e. taken from a NEMO-prefix).

4. Nested Mobility Terms

   Nested mobility occurs when there are more than one level of
   mobility. A MNN acts as an Access Router (AR) and allows visiting
   nodes to get attached to it. There are two cases of nested mobility:

   o  when the attaching node is a single node: VMN (see figure 4). For
      instance, when a passenger carrying a mobile phone gets Internet
      access from the public access network deployed into a bus.

   o  when the attaching node is a router with nodes behind it, i.e. a
      mobile network (see figure 5). For instance, when a passenger
      carrying a PAN gets Internet access from the public access network
      deployed in the bus.

   For the second case, we introduce the following terms:

4.1 Nested Mobile Network

   A mobile network is said to be nested when a mobile network is
   getting attached to a larger mobile network. The aggregated hierarchy
   of mobile networks becomes a single nested mobile network.

4.2 root-NEMO

   The mobile network at the top of the hierarchy connecting the
   aggregated nested mobile network to the Internet.

4.3 parent-NEMO

   The upstream mobile network providing Internet access to a mobile
   network down the hierarchy.

4.4 sub-NEMO

   The downstream mobile network attached to a mobile network up the
   hierarchy. It becomes a subservient of the parent-NEMO. The sub-NEMO
   is getting Internet access through the parent-NEMO and does not
   provide Internet access to the parent-NEMO.

4.5 root-MR (or TLMR, but depreciated)

   The MR(s) of the root-NEMO used to connect the nested mobile network
   to the fixed Internet. Was referred to as "TMLR" (Top-Level Mobile
   Router) in former versions of this document.

4.6 parent-MR

   The MR(s) of the parent-NEMO.

4.7 sub-MR

   The MR(s) of the sub-NEMO connected to a parent-NEMO

5. Multihoming Terms

   Multihoming, as currently defined by the IETF, covers
   site-multihoming [8] and host multihoming.

5.1 Multihomed Host

   Within host-multihoming, a host may either be:

   o  multi-addressed: multiple source addresses to choose between on a
      given interface; all IPv6 nodes are multi-addressed due to the
      presence of link-local addresses on all interfaces.

   o  multi-interfaced: multiple interfaces to choose between, on the
      same link or not.

   o  multi-linked: multiple links to choose between (just like
      multi-interfaced but all interfaces are NOT connected to the same

      link)

   o  multi-sited: when using IPv6 site-local address and attached to
      different sites


5.2 Multihomed Mobile Router

   A MR is multihomed when it has simultaneously more than one active
   connection to the Internet, that is when it is either:

   o  multi-egress-addressed MR: the MR has simultaneously multiple
      active addresses to choose between on a given egress interface

   o  multi-egress-interfaced MR: the MR has simultaneously multiple
      active egress interfaces on the same link or not

   o  multi-egress-linked MR: the MR has simultaneously multiple active
      egress interfaces on distinct links

   o  multi-egress-sited MR: the MR is simultaneously attached to
      different sites (possible distinct ISPs).

5.4 Multihomed and Nested Mobile Network

   A nested mobile network is multihomed when there are more than one
   active interface connected to the global Internet, that is when
   either:

   o  a root-MR is multihomed, or

   o  multi-rooted-NEMO: there are more than one root-MR to choose
      between

5.5 Illustration

   Fig.6 and 7 show two examples of multihomed mobile networks. Fig.8.
   shows two independent mobile networks. NEMO-1 is single-homed to the
   Internet through MR1. NEMO-2 is multihomed to the Internet through
   MR2a and MR2b. Both mobile networks offer access to visiting nodes
   and networks through an AR.

   Let's consider the two following nested scenarios in Fig.8:

   Scenario 1: what happens when MR2a's egress interfaced is attached to
   AR1 ?



      *  NEMO-2 becomes a subservient of NEMO-11

      *  NEMO-1 becomes the parent-NEMO for NEMO-2 and the root-NEMO for
         the aggregated nested mobile network

      *  NEMO-2 becomes the sub-NEMO

      *  MR1 is the root-MR for the aggregated nested mobile network

      *  MR2a is a sub-MR in the aggregated nested mobile network

      *  NEMO-2 is still multihomed to the Internet through AR1 and ARz

      *  The aggregated nested mobile network is not multihomed since
         NEMO-2 cannot be used as a transit network for NEMO-1

   Scenario 2: what happens when MR1's egress interface is attached to
   AR2 ?



      *  NEMO-1 becomes a subservient of NEMO-2

      *  NEMO-1 becomes the sub-NEMO

      *  NEMO-2 becomes the parent_NEMO for NEMO-1 and also the
         root-NEMO for the aggregated nested mobile network)

      *  MR2a and MR2b are both root-MRs for the aggregated nested
         mobile network

      *  MR1 is a sub-MR in the aggregated nested mobile network

6. Mobility Support Terms

6.1 Host mobility support

   Host Mobility Support is a mechanism which maintains session
   continuity between mobile nodes and their correspondents upon the
   mobile host's change of point of attachment. It could be achieved by
   Mobile IPv6.

6.2 Network Mobility support (NEMO Support)

   Network Mobility Support is a mechanism which maintains session
   continuity between mobile network nodes and their correspondent upon
   a mobile router's change of point of attachment. Solutions for this

Internet-Draft              NEMO Terminology               February 2004


   problem are classified into NEMO Basic Support, and NEMO Extended
   Support.

6.3 NEMO Basic Support

   NEMO Basic Support is a solution to preserve session continuity by
   means of bidirectional tunneling much like what is done using [1] for
   mobile nodes. The solution for doing this is solely specified in [3].

6.4 NEMO Extended Support

   NEMO Extended support is to provide the necessary optimization,
   including routing optimization between arbitrary MNNs and CNs.

7. New Text From Usage Draft

   The text in this section is taken from [5] and is subject to
   discussion on the mailing list.

7.1 Home Link

   The link attached to the interface at the Home Agent on which the
   Home Prefix is configured. The interface can be a virtual interface,
   in which case the Home Link is a virtual Home Link.

7.2 Home Network

   The Network formed by the application of the Home Prefix on the Home
   Link. With Nemo, the concept of Home Network is extended as explained
   below.

7.3 Home Address

   With Mobile IPv6, a Home Address is derived from the Home Network
   prefix.  This is generalized in Nemo, with some limitations: A Home
   Address can be either derived from the Home Network or from one of
   the Mobile Router's Mobile Network prefixes.

7.4 MRHA Tunnel

   The bi-directional tunnel between a Mobile Router and its Home Agent

7.5 Mobile Aggregated Prefix

   An aggregation of Mobile Network Prefixes.

7.6 Aggregated Home Network




Ernst & Lach            Expires August 16, 2004                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft              NEMO Terminology               February 2004


   The Home Network associated with a Mobile Aggregated Prefix. This
   Aggregation is advertised as a subnet on the Home Link, and thus used
   as Home Network for Nemo purposes.

7.7 Extended Home Network

   The network associated with the aggregation of one or more Home
   Network(s) and Mobile Network(s). As opposed to the Mobile IPv6 Home
   Network that is a subnet, the extended Home Network is an aggregation
   and is further subnetted.

7.8 Virtual Home Network

   The Home Network associated with a Virtual Network. The Extended Home
   Network and the Aggregated Home Network can be configured as Virtual
   Home Network.

8. Miscellaneous Terms

8.1 Idle MNN

   A MNN that does not engage in any communication.

8.2 Idle Mobile Network

   A mobile network that does not engage in any communication outside
   the network may be considered idle from the global Internet. This
   doesn't preclude that MNNs are themselves idle. Internal traffic
   between any two MNNs located in the same mobile network is not
   concerned by this statement.

9. Changes since draft-nemo-terminology-00.txt

   - NEMO will be used either as the concept for NEtwork MObility and a
   noun meaning "NEtwork that is MObile"

   - Added TMLR as depreciated term (everyone should use root-MR
   instead)

   - Added NEMO-prefix

   - Added NEMO-link

   - Added NEMO-enabled MR

   - Precision that IP address of LFN, LMN, or VMN is taken from a
   NEMO-prefix

   - Added abbreviation E-face (Egress interface) and I-face (Ingress
   interface)

   - Some re-ordering of terms, and a few typos.

   - Added some text from the usage draft [5]
