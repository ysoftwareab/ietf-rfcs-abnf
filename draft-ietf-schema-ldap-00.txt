2. Abstract

   This document defines a MIME directory profile [1] for holding an
   LDAP [2] schema.  It is intended for communication with the Internet
   schema listing service.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [4].

3. Overview

   This document defines how a MIME type may be used to transfer a 
   single LDAPv3 schema definition.  

   A schema for use with LDAPv3 consists of any number of object class, 
   attribute type, matching rule and syntax definitions.  These concepts
   are defined in the LDAPv3 protocol definition [2].

   The schema may have a numeric OID assigned to it by a schema listing
   or registration service.

   A schema may import definitions from another schema.  Schema imports
   are not, however, transitive.

   For example, a schema contains a definition for a "modem" object 
   class, which is to be defined as a subclass of the X.521 "device" 
   object class.  In this case, the schema MUST import the definitions 
   of X.521.

4. The "schema-ldap-0" MIME Directory Profile Registration
   
   This profile is identified by the following registration template 
   information.

   To: ietf-mime-direct@imc.org

   Subject: Registration of text/directory MIME profile "schema-ldap-0"

   Profile name: schema-ldap-0

   Profile purpose: To represent a schema defined for use with 
    LDAPv3 servers.

   Profile types: SOURCE, ldapSchemas, attributeTypes,
    matchingRules, objectClasses, matchingRuleUse, ldapSyntaxes

   Profile special notes:

    The charset parameter MUST be present on the MIME content, and
    the value of this parameter MUST be "utf-8".  This ensures that 
    schema values can be used in LDAPv3 attribute values without a 
    character set translation.

    Neither the "BEGIN" and "END" types nor type grouping are used 
    in contents of this profile.

    All of the types in this profile with the exception of ldapSchemas
    may be multi-valued.  Each value is present on its own contentline. 
    Values may be present in any order, and need not be arranged by type.

    The "SOURCE" type is optional, and if values are present they SHOULD
    be URIs of the "ldap" form.  If the URI is of the "ldap" form, the 
    object indicated by the URI is a subschema entry.  The use of other
    forms are reserved for future applications.

    In this version of the profile, exactly one value of the ldapSchemas
    type MUST be present.  (Later versions of the profile may permit
    multiple ldapSchemas values to be present in a content.)

    Implementors should note that there will likely be values of the 
    profile types in most contents much longer than 76 bytes.  In
    addition, there may be non-ASCII characters and embedded CRLFs
    inside of values, which could require either quoting of the value or
    use of a content transfer encoding.  

    If a contentline in a particular content contains a "context" 
    parameter and the value of that parameter is not "ldap", then that
    contentline SHOULD be ignored.

   Intended usage: COMMON

5. MIME Directory Type Registrations

   This document defines all the types, with the exception of "SOURCE"
   used in the schema-ldap-0 profile.  The "SOURCE" type is defined in
   [1].  These types are primarily intended for use in the 
   "schema-ldap-0" directory profile, although they may be applicable 
   to other profiles defined in the future.

    an LDAP schema definition.  A definition of each object class, 
    attribute, matching rule, matching rule use and syntax referenced in
    a value of ldapSchemas MUST either be defined in one of the schemas 
    referenced in the "IMPORTS" field, or present in the content 
    containing this value.

    attribute type definition.  The syntax and matching rules 
    referenced in a value of attributeTypes MUST either be present in 
    this content, or defined in one of the schemas referenced in the 
    "IMPORTS" field of the ldapSchemas line.

   Intended usage: COMMON

   Type valuetype: text, encoded according to the BNF of
   "MatchingRuleDescription" given in section 4.5 of [4].

   Type special notes: Each value of the type specifies one matching rule
    definition.  The syntax reference in a value of matchingRules MUST 
    either be present in this content, or defined in one of the schemas

7. Security Considerations
 
   A MIME body part containing an text/directory of the schema-ldap-0 
   profile may be incorporated in a digitally signed MIME content, which
   can be used to verify that the body part has not been modified in 
   transit.  When the signer has been certified by a trusted third party
   service, it may also be possible to verify the origin of the content.

Appendix A

   This appendix defines two new attributes which could be present in 
   an subschema entry.  These attributes could be added to a future 
   revision of the LDAP attribute definition [3].

A.1. ldapSchemas attribute type definition

     ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.101.120.17 NAME 'ldapSchemas' 
       SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.56 USAGE directoryOperation )

   Each value of the ldapSchemas attribute defines one schema.  Its
   syntax, given in section A.2, contains the elements needed for an 
   LDAPv3 server to correctly process operations which use the 
   definitions from this syntax.




A.2. LDAP Schema Definition syntax definition

     ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.56 DESC 'LDAP Schema Definition' )

   Values in this syntax are represented according to the following BNF:

     LdapSchema = "(" whsp
       numericoid whsp
       [ "NAME" qdescrs ]
       [ "OBSOLETE" whsp ]
       [ "IMPORTS" oids ]
       [ "CLASSES" oids ]
       [ "ATTRIBUTES" oids ]
       [ "MATCHING-RULES" oids ]
       [ "SYNTAXES" oids ]
       whsp ")"

   The numericoid field uniquely identifies the schema.  A new OID 
   should be assigned if any of the fields of the schema change.  It is 
   not possible to import definitions from a schema until an OID has 
   been assigned to it.

   The "NAME" field contains optional human-readable labels for the 
   schema.

   The "OBSOLETE" field is present if the schema is obsolete.  

   The "IMPORTS" field lists the OIDs of other schemas which are to be
   incorporated by reference into this schema.  It is an error to have
   an attribute type or object class defined in a schema with the same
   name but a different OID as an attribute type or object class in an
   imported schema.  It is also an error to import from two schema
   definitions in which there are attribute types or object classes
   with the same names but different OIDs.

   The "CLASSES" field lists the OIDs of object classes defined in this 
   schema.  A schema need not contain any object class definitions.  A 
   schema must not contain two object class definitions of the same name
   but with different OIDs.

   The "ATTRIBUTES" field lists the OIDs of attribute types defined in 
   this schema.  A schema need not contain any object class definitions.
   A schema must not contain two attribute type definitions of the same 
   name but with different OIDs.

   The "MATCHING-RULES" field lists the OIDs of matching rules defined 
   in this schema.  A schema need not contain any matching rules.

   The "SYNTAXES" field lists the OIDs of syntaxes defined in this 
   schema. A schema need not contain any syntaxes.
