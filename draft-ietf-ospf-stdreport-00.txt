Internet Draft	     OSPFv2 Standardization Report	   November 1996


1.  Introduction

    OSPFv2, herein abbreviated simply as OSPF, is an IPv4 routing
    protocol documented	in [Ref1]. OSPF	is a link-state	routing
    protocol.  It is designed to be run	internal to a single Autonomous
    System.  Each OSPF router maintains	an identical database describing
    the	Autonomous System's topology.  From this database, a routing
    table is calculated	by constructing	a shortest-path	tree. OSPF
    features include the following:

    o	OSPF responds quickly to topology changes, expending a minimum
	of network bandwidth in	the process.

    o	Support	for CIDR addressing.

    o	OSPF routing exchanges can be authenticated, providing routing
	security.

    o	Equal-cost multipath.

    o	An area	routing	capability is provided,	enabling an Autonomous
	system to be split into	a two level hierarchy to further reduce
	the amount of routing protocol traffic.

    o	OSPF allows import of external routing information into	the
	Autonomous System, including a tagging feature that can	be
	exploited to exchange extra information	at the AS boundaries
	(see [Ref7]).

    An analysis	of OSPF	together with a	more detailed description of
    OSPF features was originally provided in [Ref6], as	a part of
    promoting OSPF to Draft Standard status. The analysis of OSPF
    remains unchanged. Two additional major features have been developed
    for	OSPF since the protocol	achieved Draft Standard	status:	the
    Point-to-MultiPoint	interface and Cryptographic Authentication.
    These features are described in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 respectively of
    this memo.

    The	OSPF MIB is documented in [Ref4]. It is	currently at Draft
    Standard status.

2.  Modifications since	Draft Standard status

    OSPF was last released as RFC 1583 [Ref3], which is	labeled	with
    Draft Standard status. Implementations of the new specification in
    [Ref1] are backward-compatible with	RFC 1583. The differences
    between the	two documents are described in Appendix	G of [Ref1].
    These differences are listed briefly below.	Two major features were



Moy								[Page 2]

Internet Draft	     OSPFv2 Standardization Report	   November 1996


    also added,	the Point-to-MultiPoint	interface and Cryptographic
    Authentication, which are described	in separate sections.

    o	Configuration requirements for OSPF area address ranges	have
	been relaxed to	allow greater flexibility in area assignment.
	See Section G.3	of [Ref1] for details.

    o	The OSPF flooding algorithm was	modified to a) improve database
	convergence in networks	with low speed links and b) resolve a
	problem	where unnecessary LSA retransmissions could occur as a
	result of differing clock granularities. See Sections G.4 and
	G.5 of [Ref1] for details.

    o	To resolve the long-standing confusion regarding representation
	of point-to-point links	in OSPF, the specification now
	optionally allows advertisement	of a stub link to a point-to-
	point link's subnet, ala RIP. See Section G.6 of [Ref1].

    o	Several	problems involving advertising the same	external route
	from multiple areas were found and fixed, as described in
	Section	G.7 of [Ref1]. Without the fixes, persistent routing
	loops could form in certain such configurations. Note that one
	of the fixes was not backward-compatible, in that mixing routers
	implementing the fixes with those implementing just RFC	1583
	could cause loops not present in an RFC	1583-only configuration.
	This caused an RFC1583Compatibility global configuration
	parameter to be	added, as described in Section C.1 of [Ref1].

    2.1.  Point-to-MultiPoint interface

	The Point-to-MultiPoint	interface was added as an alternative to
	OSPF's NBMA interface when running OSPF	over non-broadcast
	subnets. Unlike	the NBMA interface, Point-to-MultiPoint	does not
	require	full mesh connectivity over the	non-broadcast subnet.
	Point-to-MultiPoint is less efficient than NBMA, but is	easier
	to configure (in fact, it can be self-configuring) and is more
	robust than NBMA, tolerating all failures within the non-
	broadcast subnet.  For more information	on the Point-to-
	MultiPoint interface, see Section G.2 of [Ref1].

	There are at least six independent implementations of the
	Point-to-MultiPoint interface. Interoperability	has been
	demonstrated between at	least two pairs	of implementations:
	between	3com and Bay Networks, and between cisco and Cascade.

    2.2.  Cryptographic	Authentication

	Non-trivial authentication was added to	OSPF with the
	development of the Cryptographic Authentication	type. This
	authentication type uses any keyed message digest algorithm,
	with explicit instructions included for	the use	of MD5.	For more
	information on OSPF authentication, see	Section	4.

	There are at least three independent implementations of	the OSPF
	Cryptographic authentication type. Interoperability has	been
	demonstrated between the implementations from cisco and	Cascade.

3.  Updated implementation and deployment experience

    When OSPF was promoted to Draft Standard Status, a report was issued
    documenting	current	implementation and deployment experience (see
    [Ref6]). That report is now	quite dated. In	an attempt to get more
    current data, a questionnaire was sent to OSPF mailing list	in
    January 1996. Twelve responses were	received, from 11 router vendors
    and	1 manufacturer of test equipment. These	responses represented 6
    independent	implementations. A tabulation of the results are
    presented below.

    Table 1 indicates the implementation, interoperability and
    deployment of the major OSPF functions. The	number in each column
    represents the number of responses in the affirmative.

4.  Protocol Security

    All	OSPF protocol exchanges	are authenticated. OSPF	supports
    multiple types of authentication; the type of authentication in use
    can	be configured on a per network segment basis. One of OSPF's
    authentication types, namely the Cryptographic authentication
    option, is believed	to be secure against passive attacks and provide
    significant	protection against active attacks. When	using the
    Cryptographic authentication option, each router appends a "message
    digest" to its transmitted OSPF packets. Receivers then use	the
    shared secret key and received digest to verify that each received
    OSPF packet	is authentic.

    The	quality	of the security	provided by the	Cryptographic
    authentication option depends completely on	the strength of	the
    message digest algorithm (MD5 is currently the only	message	digest
    algorithm specified), the strength of the key being	used, and the
    correct implementation of the security mechanism in	all



Moy								[Page 5]

    communicating OSPF implementations.	 It also requires that all
    parties maintain the secrecy of the	shared secret key.

    None of the	OSPF authentication types provide confidentiality. Nor
    do they protect against traffic analysis. Key management is	also not
    addressed by the OSPF specification.

    For	more information, see Sections 8.1, 8.2, and Appendix D	of
    [Ref1].
