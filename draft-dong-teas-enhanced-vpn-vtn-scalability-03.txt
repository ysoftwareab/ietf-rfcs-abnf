1.  Introduction

   Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) have served the industry well as a
   means of providing different customers with logically isolated
   connectivity over a common network infrastructure.  The common or
   base network that is used to provide the VPNs is often referred to as
   the underlay, and the VPN is often called an overlay.  The underlay
   is responsible for establishing the network connectivity and managing
   network resources to meet the service requirement.  The overlay is
   used to distribute the membership and reachability information of the

   customer, and provide logical separation of service delivery between
   different customers.

   Enhanced VPN service (VPN+) [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn] is targeted
   at new applications which require better isolation between customers
   and/or services, and have more stringent performance requirements
   than can be provided with existing VPNs.  To meet the requirement of
   VPN+ services, a number of Virtual Transport Networks (VTNs) need to
   be created, each has a subset of the underlay network topology and a
   set of network resources allocated from the physical network to meet
   the requirements of one or a group of VPN+ services.  The overlay
   VPNs together with the corresponding underlay VTN provide the VPN+
   service.

   Section 6 of [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn] provides some general
   analysis of the scalability of VPN+. This document gives detailed
   analysis of the scalability considerations when a large number of
   VPN+ services are provided.  Since the scalability of the overlay is
   not the major bottleneck, this document mainly focuses on the
   scalability of the underlay VTN.

2.  VPN+ Scalability Requirements

   As described in [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn], VPN+ services may
   require additional state to be introduced into the network to take
   advantage of the enhanced functionality.  This introduces some
   scalability considerations to the network.  This section gives some
   analysis of the number of VPN+ services that might be needed in a
   network.

   There are several use cases where VPN+ may be needed, and these
   determine how many VPN+ will be required in a network.  One typical
   use case of VPN+ is to deliver IETF network slice
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices] for applications or services in
   5G and other scenarios, thus the number of IETF network slices needed
   could reflect the number of VPN+ services.  With the development and
   evolution of 5G, it is expected that an increasing number of network
   slices will be deployed.  The number of network slices required
   depends on how IETF network slices will be used, and the progress of
   5G for the vertical industrial services.  The potential number of
   network slices is analyzed by classifying the network slicing
   deployment into three typical scenarios:

   1.  Network slices can be used by a network operator internally for
       different types of services.  For example, in a converged multi-
       service network, different network slices can be created to carry
       mobile transport service, fixed broadband service and enterprise
       services respectively, each type of service could be managed by a



Dong, et al.            Expires January 12, 2022                [Page 3]

       separate department or management team.  Some service types, such
       as multicast service may also be deployed in a dedicated network
       slice.  It is also possible that an infrastructure network
       operator provides network slices to other network operators as a
       wholesale service.  In this scenario, the number of network
       slices in a network would be relatively small, such as on the
       order of 10 or so.  This could be the typical case in the
       beginning of the network slice deployment.

   2.  Network slices can be used to provide isolated and customized
       virtual networks for customers in different vertical industries.
       At the early stage of the vertical industrial service deployment,
       a few top customers in some industries will begin to use network
       slices to ensure the performance of their business, such as smart
       grid, manufacturing, public safety, on-line gaming, etc.
       Considering the number of the vertical industries, and the number
       of top customers in each industry, the number of network slices
       may increase to the order of 100.

   3.  With the evolution of 5G, network slices could be widely used by
       both vertical industrial customers and enterprise customers which
       require guaranteed or predictable service performance.  The total
       amount of network slices may increase to the order of 1000 or
       more.  However, it is expected that the number of network slices
       would still be less than the number of traditional VPN services
       in the network.

   In 3GPP [TS23501], a 5G network slice is identified using Single
   Network Slice Selection Assistance Information (S-NSSAI), which is a
   32-bit identifier comprised of 8-bit Slice/Service Type (SST) and
   24-bit Slice Differentiator (SD).  This allows the mobile networks
   (RAN and CN) to provide a large number of network slices.  Although
   it is possible that multiple 5G network slices in RAN and CN are
   mapped to the same IETF network slice, the number of IETF network
   slices may still be comparable with the number of 5G network slices.
   Thus the scalability of IETF network slices needs to be taken into
   consideration.

   VPN+ needs to meet the scalability requirement of network slicing in
   different scenarios.  The increased number of VPN+ services will
   introduce additional complexity and overhead to both the control

   plane and data plane, especially in the aspects related to the
   underlying VTNs.  Although multiple VPN+ services can be mapped to
   the same VTN as the underlay, there still can be scalability
   challenges with the increased number of VTNs.

3.  VPN+ Scalability Considerations

   In this section, the scalability of VTN in the control plane and data
   plane is analyzed to understand the possible gaps in meeting the
   scalability requirement of VPN+.

3.1.  Control Plane Scalability

   As described in [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn], the control plane of
   VPN+ could be based on the hybrid of a centralized controller and the
   distributed control plane.

3.1.1.  Distributed Control Plane

   At part of the construction of VPN+ services, it is necessary to
   create multiple VTNs which provide customized topology and resource
   attributes.  The attributes and state information of each VTN needs
   to be exchanged in the control plane.  The scalability of the
   distributed control plane for the establishment and maintenance of
   VTNs needs to be considered in the following aspects:

   o  The number of control protocol instances maintained on each node

   o  The number of protocol sessions maintained on each link

   o  The number of routes advertised by each node

   o  The amount of attributes associated with each route

   o  The number of route computation (i.e.  SPF computation) executed
      on each node

   As the number of VTNs increases, it is expected that in some of the
   above aspects, the overhead in the control plane may increase
   dramatically.  For example, the overhead of maintaining separated
   control protocol instances (e.g.  IGP instances) for different VTNs
   is considered higher than maintaining the information of separated
   VTNs in the same control protocol instance with appropriate
   separation, and the overhead of maintaining separate protocol
   sessions for different VTNs is considered higher than using a shared
   protocol session for the information exchange of multiple VTNs.  To
   meet the requirement of the increasing number of VTNs, It is




Dong, et al.            Expires January 12, 2022                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft       VPN+ Scalability Considerations           July 2021


   suggested to choose the control plane mechanisms which could improve
   the scalability while still provide the required functionality.

3.1.2.  Centralized Control Plane

   Although the SDN approach can reduce the amount of control plane
   overhead in the distributed control plane, it may transfer some of
   the scalability concerns from network nodes to the centralized
   controller, thus the scalability of the controller also needs to be
   considered.

   To provide global optimization for the Traffic Engineered (TE) paths
   in different VTNs, the controller needs to keep the topology and
   resource information of all the VTNs up to date.  To achieve this,
   the controller may need to maintain a communication channel with each
   network node in the network.  When there is significant change in the
   network, or multiple VTNs requires global optimization concurrently,
   there may be a heavy processing burden at the controller, and a heavy
   load in the network surrounding the controller for the distribution
   of the updated network state and the TE paths.

3.2.  Data Plane Scalability

   To provide different VPN+ services with the required isolation and
   performance characteristics, it is necessary to allocate different
   sets of network resources to different VTNs.  As the number of VPN+
   increases, the number of VTNs will increase accordingly.  This
   requires the underlying network to provide fine-granular network
   resource partitioning, which means the amount of state about the
   reserved network resources to be maintained on network nodes will
   also increase.

   In data plane, traffic of different VPN+ services need to be
   processed separately according to the topology and resource
   constraints of the associated VTN , thus the information used for VTN
   identification needs to be carried either directly or implicitly in
   the data packet.  Different approaches of encapsulating the VTN
   information in data packet can have different scalability
   implications.

   One approach is to reuse some existing fields in the data packet to
   additionally identify the VTN the packet belongs to.  This avoids the
   cost of introducing new fields in the data packet, while since it
   introduces additional semantics to an existing field, it requires to
   change the processing of the existing field in packet forwarding.
   And when the identifiers which were used to identify a node or link
   are reused to further identify a VTN, the number of the identifiers




Dong, et al.            Expires January 12, 2022                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft       VPN+ Scalability Considerations           July 2021


   may be increased in proportion to the number of the VTNs, which may
   cause scalability problem in some networks.

   Another alternative approach is to introduce a dedicated field in the
   packet for VTN identification.  This could avoid the impact to the
   existing fields in the packet.  And if this new field carries a
   global-significant VTN identifier, it could be used together with the
   existing fields to determine the VTN-specific packet forwarding.  The
   potential issue with this approach is the difficulty in introducing a
   new field in some types of the data plane.

   In addition, the introduction of per VTN packet forwarding has impact
   on the scalability of the forwarding entries on network nodes, as a
   network node may need to maintain separate forwarding entries for
   each VTN it participates in.

3.3.  Gap Analysis of Existing Mechanisms

   One candidate approach to build VTN is to use VTN specific Segment
   Routing (either SR-MPLS or SRv6) Identifiers in the data plane
   [I-D.ietf-spring-sr-for-enhanced-vpn], and define and distribute the
   associated topology and resource attribute of each VTN based on
   Multi-topology [RFC4915] [RFC5120] [I-D.ietf-lsr-isis-sr-vtn-mt],
   Flex-Algo [I-D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo] [I-D.zhu-lsr-isis-sr-vtn-flexalgo]
   or the combination of these mechanisms in the control plane.  This
   mechanism is suitable for networks with a limited number of VTNs.  As
   the number of VTNs increases, there may be several scalability
   challenges with this approach:

   1.  The number of SR SIDs needed will increase in proportion to the
       number of VTNs in the network, which will bring challenges both
       to the distribution of SIDs and the related information in the
       control plane, and to the installation of forwarding entries for
       VTN-specific SIDs in the data plane.

   2.  The number of route computation (e.g.  SPF computation) will
       increase in proportion to the number of VTNs in the network,
       which may introduce significant overhead to the control plane of
       network nodes.

   3.  The maximum number of logical topologies supported by OSPF is
       128, and the maximum number of Flex-Algo is 128, which may not
       meet the required number of VTNs in some network scenarios.

4.  Possible Scalability Optimizations

4.1.  Control Plane Optimizations

   For the distributed control plane, several optimizations can be
   considered to reduce the control plane overhead and improve the
   scalability.

   The first optimization mechanism is to reduce the amount of control
   plane sessions used for the establishment and maintenance of the
   VTNs.  For multiple VTNs which have the same peering relationship
   between two adjacent network nodes, it is proposed that one single
   control protocol session is used for the establishment of multiple
   VTNs.  The information of different VTNs can be exchanged over the
   same session, with necessary identification information to
   distinguish the VTNs in the control messages.  This could reduce the
   overhead of maintaining a large number of control protocol sessions
   for different VTNs, and could also reduce the amount of control plane
   messages flooded in the network.

   The second optimization mechanism is to decompose the attributes of a
   VTN into different groups, so that different types of VTN attribute
   can be advertised and processed separately in control plane.  There
   are two basic types of attributes associated with a VTN: the topology
   attribute and the network resource attribute.  In a network, it is
   possible that multiple VTNs share the same topology, and multiple
   VTNs may share the same set of network resources on particular
   network segments.  Then it is more efficient if only one copy of the
   topology attribute is advertised, and multiple VTNs sharing the same
   topology could refer to this topology information.  More importantly,
   with this approach the result of topology-based route computation
   could be shared by multiple VTNs, so that the overhead of per-VTN
   route computation could be reduced . Similarly, information of a
   subset of network resources reserved on a particular network segment
   could be advertised once and be referred to by multiple VTNs which
   share the same set of resources.  This methodology could also apply
   to other attributes of VTN which may be introduced later and can be
   processed independently.

   corresponding routing and forwarding tables.

   Figure 3 gives another example of two VTNs which share the same set
   of network resources on some links.  In this case, information about
   the reserved resource on each link only needs to be advertised once,
   then both VTN-1 and VTN-2 could refer to the link resource for
   constraint based path computation.

   For the optimization of the centralized control plane, it is
   suggested that the centralized controller is used as a complementary
   mechanism to the distributed control plane rather than a replacement,
   so that the VTN specific path computation burden in control plane
   could be shared by both the centralized controller and the network
   nodes, thus the scalability of both systems could be improved.

4.2.  Data Plane Optimizations

   To support more VPN+ services while keeping the amount of data plane
   state at a reasonable scale, one possible approach is to classify a
   set of VPN+ services which have similar service characteristics and
   performance requirements into a group, and such group of VPN+
   services is mapped to one VTN, which is allocated with an aggregated
   set of network topology and resources to meet the service requirement
   of the whole group of VPN+. Different groups of VPN+ services need to
   be mapped to different VTNs with different set of network resources
   allocated.  With appropriate grouping of VPN+ services, a reasonable
   number of VTNs with network resources reservation and aggregation
   could still meet the service requirements.

   Another optimization in the data plane is to decouple the identifier
   used for topology-based forwarding and the identifier used for the
   resource-specific processing introduced by VTN.  One possible
   mechanism is to introduce a dedicated VTN-ID in the packet header to
   uniquely identify the set of local network resources allocated to a
   VTN on each network node for the processing and forwarding of the
   received packet.  Then the existing identifier in the packet header
   used for topology based forwarding is kept unchanged.  The benefit is
   the amount of topology-specific identifiers is in proportion to the
   number of topologies rather than the number of VTNs, so that its
   scalability will not be impacted by the increased number of VTN.
   Since this new VTN-ID field will be used together with the existing
   fields to determine the VTN-specific packet forwarding, this MAY
   require network nodes to support a hierarchical forwarding table in
   the data plane.  Figure 4 shows the concept of using different data
   plane identifiers for topology-based and VTN resource-based packet
   processing respectively.

                   Figure 4. Decoupled Data Plane Identifiers

   In an IPv6 [RFC8200] based network, this could be achieved by
   introducing a dedicated field in either the IPv6 fixed header or the
   extension headers to carry the VTN identifier for the resource-
   specific forwarding, while keeping the destination IP address field
   used for routing towards the destination prefix in the corresponding
   topology.  Note that the VTN-ID needs to be parsed by every node
   along the path which is capable of VTN-specific forwarding.  In an
   MPLS [RFC3032] based network, this may be achieved by introducing a
   dedicated MPLS label to identify the VTN, while the existing MPLS
   labels could be used for topology-based packet forwarding towards the
   associated destination prefix.  This requires that both labels be
   parsed by each node along the forwarding path of the packet, and the
   forwarding behavoir depends on the position of the VTN label in the
   label stack.  Another option with the MPLS data plane is to introduce
   a new MPLS extension header which follows the MPLS label stack to
   carry the VTN-ID and the associated information.  The detailed
   extensions in IPv6 and MPLS data plane encapsulation are out of the
   scope of this document.

5.  Solution Evolution for Improved Scalability

   Based on the analysis in this document, the control plane and data
   plane for VPN+ needs to evolve to support the increasing number of
   VPN+ services in the network.

   At the first step, by introducing resource-awareness to segment
   routing SIDs [I-D.ietf-spring-resource-aware-segments], and using
   Multi-Topology or Flex-Algo as the control plane, it could provide a
   solution for building a limited number of VTNs in the network to meet
   the requirement of a relatively small number of VPN+ services in the
   network.  This mechanism is considered as the basic SR VTN.

   As the number of required VPN+ services increases, more VTNs may be
   needed, then the control plane scalability could be improved by

   decoupling the topology attribute from other attributes (e.g.
   resource attribute) of VTN, so that multiple VTNs could share the
   same topology or resource attribute.  This mechanism is considered as
   the scalable SR VTN.  Both the basic and the scalable SR VTN
   mechanisms are described in [I-D.ietf-spring-sr-for-enhanced-vpn].

   If the data plane scalability becomes a concern, dedicated data plane
   VTN-ID can be introduced to decouple the topology-specific
   identifiers from the VTN-specific resource identifiers in the data
   plane, this could help to reduce the number of SR SIDs needed to
   support a large number of VTNs.  This mechanism is considered as the
   Resource-Independent (RI) VTN.
