1  Introduction

   The growth of the Internet has witnessed an emergence of transport
   services that rely on or can benefit from assistance of network
   intermediaries between communicating end-points [1, 2, 3].  Such
   services, for example, include TCP performance enhancements,
   multimedia packet filtering, header compression, and prevention of
   Denial-of-Service.  As for network intermediaries, they could be
   routers, switches, application gateways, middle boxes [1],
   performance enhancing proxies [2], or nodes of an overlay network.
   To provide intermediary-based services they may make use of the
   knowledge of aggregated and per-flow traffic behavior at its
   location as well as their processing, caching and/or filtering
   capabilities.

   There are two important components of the problem of enabling
   intermediary-based services.  First, end users may need to
   communicate with the network intermediaries for configuration and
   solicitation of service.  Second, the end users must make any
   information available to the intermediary that might be necessary
   for them to offer the requested services.  The second problem is
   especially challenging when an end-to-end security solution such
   as IPsec is used.  Using IPsec, an end-user cannot contract
   value-added services from a network intermediary unless it fully
   sacrifices end-to-end security.  Overall, we believe work is
   necessary to determine how to request, authenticate, authorize,
   and obtain the services of intermediaries, and to minimize the
   impact of intermediaries on end-to-end security.

   Depending on the intermediaries and the services offered by them,
   the problem of securely enabling intermediary-based services could
   have various aspects.  In this draft, we describe some of the
   important aspects of the problem.  We also present several
   scenarios where the problem of securely enabling
   intermediary-based services is manifested.  This document invites
   the response from the Internet community and proposes that the
   problem of securely enabling intermediary-based services should
   become a work item in the IETF.


2  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in [4].

    o  End-point:  An end-user node including a PC, a laptop, a
       hand-held device, etc.  running user applications.


    o  Intermediary:  A network node including a router, a switch, an
       application gateway, a middle box [1], a performance enhancing
       proxy [2], or a node of an overlay network.


3  Problem Description

   In this document we focus on the problem of securely enabling and
   using intermediary-based services.  We identify the key components
   of this problem, and describe them in the following subsections.


   3.1  Communication Between End-points and Intermediary

     The end-points and the intermediary may need to communicate
     with each other to request and control intermediary-based
     services.  In particular, the communication may serve functions
     such as the ones described below.

       o Service discovery:  The end-point might need to discover the
         services that are available from the intermediary.  Service
         discovery might be especially important in the case of
         mobile users.  The mobile users could roam into a foreign
         network and might need to discover what intermediary-based
         services are available.


       o Service negotiation:  The end-points should be able to


Blumenthal et al                 Expires 12/03                 [Page 3]

INTERNET-DRAFT   draft-blumenthal-intermediary-transport-00.txt  06/20


         negotiate services and service options with the
         intermediary.  Service renegotiation might also be required
         due to any changing requirements of the end-points and due
         to changing conditions at the intermediary.


       o Service consent:  The end-points must consent to the
         services they are offered.  There are two important reasons
         why this consent must be made by the end-points.  First, the
         end-points should allow access to and possibly modification
         of end-to-end data.  This is discussed in details in the
         next section.  Second, there might be a charge associated
         with the services that an end-point must pay for receiving
         the services.


       o Service configuration:  The end-points and the intermediary
         need to exchange appropriate parameters for configuring the
         intermediary-based services.  Some of these parameters could
         be header formats, estimates of (or actual) resources
         required for offering a service, identity of data flows etc.


       o Setting up trust relationships and security associations:
         The end-points and the intermediary must be able to mutually
         authenticate each other.  This mutual authentication process
         might involve other nodes such as a home agent or a home
         location register in the case of mobile users.  The
         end-points and the intermediary will also need to exchange
         keys and set up security associations to communicate
         securely.  Separate security associations will be required
         between each end-point and the intermediary offering
         services and potentially between intermediaries if multiple
         intermediaries are involved in offering services.  The
         end-points and the intermediary should tear down security
         associations when intermediary services are completed,
         revoked, or in the event of failures of the intermediary or
         the end-points.


       o Transfer of state:  The intermediary might need to transfer
         state information associated with the services it has
         negotiated and is currently offering or any other security
         related information (cryptographic counters, keys, etc.)  to
         another intermediary in the case of an impending failure,
         for load balancing or due to user mobility.


     Although intermediaries might voluntarily offer some services
     without requiring any explicit communication with the

Blumenthal et al                 Expires 12/03                 [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT   draft-blumenthal-intermediary-transport-00.txt  06/20


     end-points, this will not be true when end-to-end security
     (e.g.  IPsec) is used.  When end-to-end security is used,
     end-points must explicitly communicate with the intermediary
     for setting up services and assist an intermediary with the
     information required to offer services.  In this document, we
     are interested in only those services that require explicit
     communication between end-points and the intermediary.


   3.2  Exposing Information

     Another extremely important aspect of enabling
     intermediary-based services is selective exposure of
     information to an intermediary by the end-points.  This
     information might be required by the intermediary to provide
     the requested services to the end-points.  Typically, in order
     to provide service, an intermediary may need to access protocol
     headers of the data packets.  Exposing information to an
     intermediary becomes complex when end-to-end security (such as
     IPsec) is used.  When IPsec ESP [5] is used between two
     end-points, the entire IP packet except for the outer IP header
     might be encrypted using keys known only to the end-points and
     none of the upper layer headers (including the inner IP header
     in the case of IP encapsulation) is accessible to the
     intermediary.  How to expose information to an intermediary
     while maintaining an acceptable level of end-to-end security is
     a very challenging problem.  Currently, there is no standard
     way of exposing and accessing protocol headers when an
     end-to-end security protocol such as IPsec ESP is used.
     There are several critical dimensions of the problem of
     selectively exposing information.  These are described below.


       o Information that can be exposed:  The information that could
         be exposed to an intermediary will depend upon the nature of
         the requested service.  In some cases only the transport and
         network layer information will need to be exposed to the
         intermediary.  For example, an intermediary providing a TCP
         PEP service [2] will need access to the TCP headers.  In
         other cases upper layer information might be required at the
         intermediary to offer services.  For example, when an
         intermediary is providing a service to filter out low
         priority multimedia packets during network congestion [6],
         it might require access to the multimedia transport headers
         to find out the packet priority.


       o Where the required information is located:  It is not enough
         to agree upon what information will be exposed to the
         intermediary.  The intermediary may not know where to find

Blumenthal et al                 Expires 12/03                 [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT   draft-blumenthal-intermediary-transport-00.txt  06/20


         it in the packet.  The end-points may have to help the
         intermediary find the exposed information.


       o Who decides what information can be exposed:  One of the
         important questions in relation to exposing information is
         who decides what information could be exposed.  We believe
         that in most of the cases the end-points will decide what
         information should be exposed to an intermediary.  This is
         because, based on the services they require, the end-points
         are in the best position to decide what should be exposed to
         the intermediary.


       o Access rights to exposed information:  A very important
         issue associated with exposing information is what access
         rights should be given to the intermediary.  In many
         situations it might be enough to allow the intermediary to
         inspect the exposed information and provide the services
         based on that information.  This situation arises commonly
         when an intermediary is used to offer some sort of filtering
         services (e.g., filtering of low priority multimedia packets
         in the presence of network congestion).  In other cases it
         might be necessary to allow the intermediary to inspect and
         also modify the exposed information.  Such an inspect-modify
         capability will be required at an intermediary offering TCP
         PEP services [2].  In some cases an intermediary might need
         to inspect and then not just modify exposed information but
         also generate new packets.  This situation arises when an
         intermediary offering TCP PEP services is required to
         generate ``local'' TCP acknowledgements.


       o Method for exposing information:  The end-points will need
         new methods for selectively exposing information to an
         intermediary.  The end-points must assist the intermediary
         in finding the exposed information.  Current security
         standards (such as IPsec) allow either full exposure of all
         the data from the end-points or no exposure of any end-point
         data other than the outer IP headers.


     All the above issues related to exposing information are
     dependent upon the services offered by the intermediary and the
     service and security requirements of the end user application.
     It is very important to note that not all intermediary-based
     services require exposing end-to-end information to the
     intermediary.  Some services could be built by using



Blumenthal et al                 Expires 12/03                 [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT   draft-blumenthal-intermediary-transport-00.txt  06/20


     information that is usually visible even when end-to-end
     security mechanisms are used.  An example of such a service is
     described in Section 4.

     Based on the discussion in this subsection, the problem of
     exposing information could be categorized as follows:


      1. All communications between end-points are end-to-end
         encrypted.


      2. Communications between end-points are end-to-end
         authenticated but not encrypted, thereby allowing inspection
         but not modification of information.


      3. Some of the information exchanged between end-points is
         exposed to the intermediary for inspection as well as
         modification and the end-points assist the intermediary in
         finding that information.


   3.3  Preserving Security

     Preserving acceptable security and allowing an intermediary to
     perform its services, while selectively exposing information to
     an intermediary is a challenging task.  Once again, this aspect
     of the problem is also multi-dimensional.  These dimensions are
     discussed below:


       o Trust between End-points and the Intermediary:  A trust
         relationship between the end-points and the intermediary is
         one of the most fundamental issues in enabling
         intermediary-based services.  The end-points and the
         intermediary must trust each other with the information that
         is exposed and the services that are offered and obtained.
         Mechanisms necessary to build and maintain this trust must
         be investigated.


       o Detecting and Responding to Any Inappropriate Behavior of
         Intermediary:  The trust model between the end-points and
         the intermediary requires that the intermediary would not
         use the information exposed to it for obtaining services to
         attack the end-points or play ``end-to-end'' games.  An
         example of an end-to-end game that could be played by an
         intermediary is as follows.  An intermediary with access to


Blumenthal et al                 Expires 12/03                 [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT   draft-blumenthal-intermediary-transport-00.txt  06/20


         TCP headers could change the ordering of TCP packets even
         when the TCP payload is encrypted.  Trusting the
         intermediary does not imply that the end-points do not
         detect and respond to inappropriate actions of the
         intermediary.  The questions of how do end-points detect any
         inappropriate behavior of the intermediary and how do they
         respond to the inappropriate behavior need to be addressed.


       o Exposed information Accessible only to intended recipients:
         An important dimension of the problem of preserving
         acceptable end-to-end security is how should the information
         exposed to the intermediary be secured from the rest of the
         network.  Additional security layers might be required to
         achieve this.  One potentially serious problem with exposing
         information to an intermediary is how to prevent it from
         sharing the exposed information with other entities in the
         network.  Unfortunately it does not seem that this problem
         can be solved.


       o Security Associations:  The end-points and the intermediary
         need to set up security associations among themselves for
         secure communication.  One approach to setting up security
         associations is to set them one-to-one, i.e., only two nodes
         (among the two-end points and the intermediary) are part of
         a single security association.  Alternately, as proposed
         in [7], it is possible to have, composite security
         associations or one-to-many security associations that
         involve more than two nodes, e.g., both end-points and the
         intermediary.


     As before, how the security is preserved will depend upon the
     nature of the end-user applications and offered
     intermediary-based services.


4  Problem Manifestations

   The problem described in the previous section is manifests itself
   in several intermediary-based transport services.  We now present
   four representative scenarios of intermediary-based services.


   1.  TCP Performance Enhancing Proxy (PEP)


   2.  Header compression/decompression


Blumenthal et al                 Expires 12/03                 [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT   draft-blumenthal-intermediary-transport-00.txt  06/20


   3.  QoS Provisioning


   4.  Prevention of Denial-of-Service


    o  TCP Enhancements - Enhancements to transport protocols such as
       TCP over error prone and bandwidth-limited links has been an
       area of study for almost a decade.  Particularly, when
       wireless links are involved, the variance in delay is found to
       be an important factor influencing TCP performance [8].  Large
       delay variance decreases the effective client throughput of
       all TCP-based applications.  An accepted mechanism for
       enhancing TCP performance in such situations is the
       implementation of a TCP-PEP at the intermediate node.  The
       TCP-PEP can examine, modify or generate TCP packets so as to
       match the characteristics of the wireline interface to that of
       the wireless interface thus improving end-to-end TCP
       performance.


       Figure 1 shows an example of TCP throughput enhancement for a
       mobile wireless user.  In this figure, the mobile user is
       communicating with a server using TCP. An intermediate TCP-PEP
       regulates the acknowledgments [8] from the mobile host to
       account for the large variations in wireless delay experienced
       by data flowing towards the mobile, thereby enhancing overall
       TCP throughput.


    o  Header Compression - Compressing protocol headers over
       wireless access links will help save precious wireless
       bandwidth [9, 10].  Even though, it is possible to achieve
       header compression between two end-points of an IP tunnel or
       two adjacent IP hops, most of the header compression schemes
       are sensitive to delays and loss between the end-points.
       [11] shows that the average header size increases
       significantly at high loss.  In [12] the authors show the
       impact of delay on the efficiency of their header compression

       scheme.  Achieving header compression and decompression close
       to a congested link with the help of an intermediary could
       help in improving performance of the header compression
       schemes.  Multiple protocols, including some existing ones,
       could be potentially used to achieve intermediary-based header
       compression.  For example, the Secure Real-time Transport
       Protocol (SRTP) [13] could be used to secure the Real-time
       Transport Protocol (RTP) payload but leave the IP/UDP/RTP
       headers accessible to the intermediary allowing header
       compression at the intermediary.


    o  QoS Provisioning, Differential Services, Packet Classification
       and Policy Implementation - An intermediate node could
       identify flows based on source and destination IP addresses,
       TCP/UDP source and destination port numbers, IPsec security
       parameter index (SPI), and next protocol identity, to offer
       quality of service guarantees and differentiated treatment to
       certain packets.  It could also use the DSCP (Differentiated

       example, the intermediate node, could assign lower priority to
       ``non-conforming'' UDP traffic and a higher priority to TCP
       traffic during link congestion.  An intermediate node could
       use the security parameter index in IPsec packets together
       with the IP destination address to identify flows for
       providing RSVP-based quality of service.  This assumes that
       RSVP signaling [14] is used to create the required state in
       the intermediate node.  These examples show that packets could
       be classified using multiple fields.  A specific
       classification method and policy implementation will depend on
       the application.


       Figure 2 shows an example of filtering packets based on
       multimedia transport information.  In this figure, multi-layer
       video is unicast from the source to the receiver.  On
       observing link congestion, the intermediate node, in the path
       from the source to receiver, selectively drops packets of
       lower priority layers.  The identity of the layers is found in
       the multimedia transport header.  The intermediate node
       performing the selective dropping must have the knowledge of
       the multimedia transport header format.  Keller [6] has
       demonstrated dramatic improvements in video quality by using

       one such scheme.


    o  Prevention of Denial-of-Service (DoS) - Intermediate nodes
       could be configured to filter out packets from unwanted
       sources to enterprise Virtual Private Network (VPN) clients.
       Enterprise VPN clients commonly establish secure sessions with
       their enterprise gateways for accessing their company
       resources (computers and servers).  These clients, especially
       bandwidth limited wireless mobile enterprise users, can be
       potentially flooded with unwanted packets from IP addresses
       outside the enterprise or even spoofed enterprise IP
       addresses.  These unwanted packets could be 'ingress-filtered'
       at an intermediate node (e.g., a public data service node) in
       the path from the enterprise client to the enterprise gateway
       by setting up an additional authentication tunnel between the
       enterprise gateway and the intermediate node.  On receiving
       packets with source addresses set to valid enterprise IP
       addresses, the intermediate node allows only those packets
       that it can authenticate and drops the rest.



   In the first three scenarios, an intermediary accesses the
   protocol headers (TCP, RTP/UDP/IP) for offering the services.  If
   end-to-end security solutions such as IPsec ESP [5] are used, the
   protocol headers are not accessible to the intermediary.  The
   problem here is to enable the end-points and the intermediary to
   negotiate services and configure services, as well as allowing the
   intermediary secure access to the protocol headers.  In the last
   scenario, the problem is to set up the additional authentication
   tunnels with the help of a communication protocol between the
   intermediary and the end-points to prevent denial-of-service
   attacks.  Note that, unlike the other three examples, in this
   scenario, the intermediary does not require any special access to
   end-to-end encrypted payload or header.


5  Security Considerations

   This document discusses the problem of ``securely enabling
   intermediary based services'' and as such does not require any
   additional discussion on security considerations.


6  Related Work

   The problem of ``trusted'' middle boxes performing policy
   decisions has been considered in [1] but instead of a MIDCOM

   protocol that opens a pin-hole in a middle box to permit sessions
   through a firewall or a NAT middlebox, intermediary-based
   transport services authorize an intermediary to have access to
   packets for offering services.  More generally, we argue the need
   for secure enablers in various transport intermediary services in
   order for trusted middle boxes to inspect, and/or modify transport
   headers.


7  Conclusions

   We have presented the problem of securely enabling
   intermediary-based services.  The various components of this
   problem have been identified and discussed.  We also presented
   scenarios where this problem is manifested.  We propose that the
   problem of securely enabling intermediary-based services becomes a
   work item in the IETF.
