1. Abstract

    This memo defines an encoding scheme for the Japanese Characters,
    describes "ISO-2022-JP-1", which is used in electronic mail
    [RFC-822], and network news [RFC 1036]. Also this memo provides a
    listing of the Japanese Character Set that can be used in this
    encoding scheme.

2. Requirements Notation

    This document uses terms that appear in capital letters to
    indicate particular requirements of this specification. Those terms
    are "MUST", "SHOULD", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY". The
    meaning of each term are found in [RFC-2119]

3. Introduction

    RFC 1468 defines the way Japanese Characters are encoded, likewise
    what this memo defines. It defines the use of JIS X 0208 as the
    double-byte character set in ISO-2022-JP text.

    Today, many operating systems support proprietary extended Japanese =

    characters or JIS X 0212, This includes the Unicode character set,
    which does not conform to JIS X 0201 nor JIS X 0208. Therefore,
    this limits the ability to communicate and correspond precise
    information because of the limited availability of Kanji
    characters. Fortunately JIS(Japanese Industry Standard) defines
    JIS X 0212 as "code of the supplementary Japanese graphic character
    set for information interchange". Most Japanese characters which
    are used in regular electronic mail in most cases can be
    accommodated in JIS X 0201, JIS X 0208 and JIS X 0212.

    Also it is recognized that there is a tendency to use Unicode,
    however, Unicode is not yet widely used and there is a certain
    limitation with old electronic mail system. Furthermore, the
    purpose of this comment is to add the capability of writing out
    JIS X 0212.

    This comment does not describe any representation of iso-2022-jp-1
    version information in addition to JIS X 0212 support.

4. Description

    In "ISO-2022-JP-1" text, the initial character code of the message
    is in ASCII. The "double-byte-seq"(see "Format Syntax" section)
    (ESC "$" "B" / ESC "$" "@" / ESC "$" "(" "D") is the only
    designator that indicates that the following character is
    double-byte, and it is valid until another escape sequence appears.
    It is very discouraged to use (ESC "$" "@") for double byte
    character encoding, new implementation SHOULD use only
    (ESC "$" "B") for double byte encoding instead.

    The end of "ISO-2022-JP-1" text MUST be in ASCII. Also it is
    strongly recommended to back up to the ASCII at the end of each
    line rather than JIS X 0201-Roman if there is any none ASCII
    character in middle of a line.

    Since "ISO-2022-JP-1" is designed to add the capability of writing
    out JIS X 0212, if the message does not contain none of JIS X 0212
    characters. "ISO-2022-JP" text MUST BE used.

    JIS X 0201-Roman is not identical to the ASCII with two different
    characters.

    The following list are the escape sequences and character sets
    that can be used in "ISO-2022-JP-1" text. The registered number in
    the ISO 2375 Register which allow double-byte ideographic scripts
    to be encoded within ISO/IEC 2022 code structure is indicated as
    reg# below.

    reg# character set     ESC sequence                  designated to
    6    ASCII             ESC 2/8 4/2                   ESC ( B    G0
    42   JIS X 0208-1978   ESC 2/4 4/0                   ESC $ @    G0
    87   JIS X 0208-1983   ESC 2/4 4/2                   ESC $ B    G0
    14   JIS X 0201-Roman  ESC 2/8 4/10                  ESC ( J    G0
    159  JIS X 0212-1990   ESC 2/4 2/8 4/4               ESC $ ( D  G0

    Other restrictions are given in the Formal Syntax below.

5. Formal Syntax

    The notational conventions used here are identical to those used in
    STD 11, RFC 822 [RFC822].

    The * (asterisk) convention is as follows:
           l*m something
    meaning at least l and at most m something, with l and m taking
    default values of 0 and infinity, respectively.

    iso-2022-jp-1-text  =3D *( line CRLF ) [line]

    line                =3D (*single-byte-char *segment
                         single-byte-seq *single-byte-char) /
                         *single-byte-char

    segment             =3D single-byte-segment / double-byte-segment

    single-byte-segment =3D single-byte-seq *single-byte-char
    double-byte-segment =3D double-byte-seq *(one-of-94 one-of-94)

    reset-seq           =3D ESC "(" ( "B" / "J" )
    single-byte-seq     =3D ESC "(" ( "B" / "J" )
    double-byte-seq     =3D (ESC "$" ( "@" / "B" )) /
                           (ESC "$" "(" "D" )

    CRLF                =3D CR LF
                                                  ;( Octal, Decimal.)
    ESC                 =3D <ISO 2022 ESC, escape>     ;( 33,   27.     =
)
    SI                  =3D <ISO 2022 SI, shift-in>    ;( 17,   15.     =
)
    SO                  =3D <ISO 2022 SO, shift-out>   ;( 16,   14.     =
)
    CR                  =3D <ASCII CR, carriage return>;( 15,   13.     =
)
    LF                  =3D <ASCII LF, linefeed>       ;( 12,   10.     =
)
    one-of-94           =3D <any one of 94 values>     =
;(41-176,33.-126.)
    one-of-96           =3D <any one of 96 values>     =
;(40-177,32.-127.)
    7BIT                =3D <any 7-bit value>          ;( 0-177,0.-127. =
)
    single-byte-char    =3D <any 7BIT, including bare CR & bare LF,
                but NOT including CRLF, and not including ESC, SI, SO>

6. Security Considerations

    This draft does not address security issues.

7. MIME Considerations

    The name to be used for the Japanese encoding scheme in content is
    "ISO-2022-JP-1". When this name is used in the MIME message form,
    it would be:

        Content-Type: text/plain; charset=3Diso-2022-jp-1

    Since the "ISO-2022-JP-1" is 7bit encoding, it will be unnecessary
    to encode in another format by specifying the "Content-Transfer-
    Encoding" header. Also applying Based64 or Quoted-Printable
    encoding MAY cause today's software to fail to decode the message.

    "ISO-2022-JP-1" can be used in MIME headers. Also "ISO-2022-JP-1"
    text can be used with Base64 or Quoted-Printable encoding.

8. Additional Information

    As long as mail systems are capable of writing out Unicode, it is
    recommended to also write out Unicode text in addition to "ISO-
    2022-JP-1" text. Also writing out "ISO-2022-JP" text in addition to =

    "ISO-2022-JP-1" is strongly encouraged for backward compatibility
    reasons.

    Some mail systems write out 8bits characters in 'parameter' and
    'value' defined in [RFC 822] and [RFC 1521]. All 8bit characters
    MUST NOT be used in those fields. The implementation of future
    mail systems SHOULD support those only for interoperability
    reasons.
