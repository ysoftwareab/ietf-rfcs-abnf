1.  Introduction

   A hierarchical PCE architecture is described in RFC 6805, in which a
   parent PCE has a number of child PCEs.  A child PCE may also be a
   parent PCE, which has multiple child PCEs.

   For a parent PCE, it needs to obtain the information about each of
   its child PCEs.  The information about a child PCE comprises the
   address or ID of the PCE and the domain for which the PCE is
   responsible.  It may also include the position of the PCE, which
   indicates whether the PCE is a leaf (i.e., only a child) or branch
   (i.e., a child and also a parent).

   For a child PCE, it needs to obtain the information about its parent
   PCE, which includes the address or ID of the parent PCE.

   This document presents extensions to the Path Computation Element
   Communication Protocol (PCEP) to discover parent child relations and
   the information on a parent and a child PCE in a hierarchical PCE
   system.

2.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used in this document.

   Parent Domain:  A domain higher up in a domain hierarchy such that it
      contains other domains (child domains) and potentially other links
      and nodes.

   Child Domain:  A domain lower in a domain hierarchy such that it has
      a parent domain.

   Parent PCE:  A PCE responsible for selecting a path across a parent
      domain and any number of child domains by coordinating with child
      PCEs and examining a topology map that shows domain inter-
      connectivity.

   Child PCE:  A PCE responsible for computing the path across one or
      more specific (child) domains.  A child PCE maintains a
      relationship with at least one parent PCE.

4.  Extensions to PCEP

   This section describes the extensions to PCEP to discover the
   relation between a parent PCE and a child PCE and the information on
   a parent and a child PCE in a hierarchical PCE system.  A child PCE
   is simply called a child and a parent PCE is called a parent in the
   following sections.

4.1.  Discovery of Parent Child Relation

   During a PCEP session establishment between two PCEP speakers, each
   of them advertises its capabilities for Hierarchical PCE (H-PCE for
   short) through the Open Message with the Open Object containing a new
   TLV to indicate its capabilities for H-PCE.  This new TLV is called
   H-PCE capability TLV.  It has the following format.

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |            Type = TBD1        |            Length             |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |P|C|                    Capability Flags                       |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                       Optional  Sub-TLVs                      |
       ~                                                               ~
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The type of the TLV is TBD1.  It has a length of 4 octets plus the
   size of optional Sub-TLVs.  The value of the TLV comprises a
   capability flags field of 32 bits, which are numbered from the most
   significant as bit zero.  Two of them are defined as follows.  The
   others are not defined and MUST be set to zero.

   o  P (Parent - 1 bit): Bit 0 is used as P flag.  It is set to 1
      indicating a parent.

   o  C (Child - 1 bit): Bit 1 is used as C flag.  It is set to 1
      indicating a child.

   The following Sub-TLVs are defined:

   o  A Domain Sub-TLV containing an AS number and optional area, and

   o  PCE-ID Sub-TLV containing the ID of a PCE.

4.2.  Sub-TLVs

   When a child sends its parent a Open message, it places the
   information about it in the message through using some optional Sub-
   TLVs.  When a parent sends each of its child PCEs a Open message, it
   puts the information about it in the message.

4.2.1.  Domain Sub-TLV

   A domain is a AS or an area in an AS.  An AS is identified by an AS
   number.  An area in an AS is identified by the combination of the AS
   and the area.  The former is indicated by an AS number and the latter
   by an area number.  A domain is represented by a domain Sub-TLV
   containing an AS number and a optional area number.

   The format of the domain Sub-TLV is shown below:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |         Type (tTBD1)          |             Length            |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                       AS Number (4 bytes)                     |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     ~                      Optional  Area Number                    ~
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   where Length is four plus size of area number.


   An AS is represented by a domain Sub-TLV containing only the AS
   number of the AS.  In this case, the Length is four.  An area in an
   AS is represented by a domain Sub-TLV containing the AS number of the
   AS and the area number of the area.  In this case, the Length is
   eight.

4.2.2.  PCE ID Sub-TLV

   An Identifier (ID) of a PCE (PCE ID for short) is a 32-bit number
   that can uniquely identify the PCE among all PCEs.  This 32-bit
   number for PCE ID SHOULD NOT be zero.

   The format of the PCE ID Sub-TLV is shown below:

  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

The PCE ID Sub-TLV specifies an non zero number as the identifier of the PCE.

   Alternatively, an IP address attached to a PCE can also be used as an
   identifier of the PCE.  The format of an IPv4 address Sub-TLV is
   shown below:

      0                   1                   2                   3

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |         Type (tTBD4)          |           Length (4)          |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                     IPv4 Address (4 bytes)                    |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The IPv4 address Sub-TLV specifies an IPv4 address associated with
   the PCE, which is used as the identifier of the PCE.

   The format of an IPv6 address Sub-TLV is shown below:

      0                   1                   2                   3

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |         Type (tTBD5)          |          Length (16)          |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                     IPv6 Address (16 bytes)                   |
     ~                                                               ~
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The IPv6 Sub-TLV specifies an IPv6 address associated with the PCE,
   which is used as the identifier of the PCE.

4.3.  Procedures

   For two PCEs A and B, they discover each other through Open messages
   in the initialization phase.  The following is a sequence of events
   related.

             A                                     B
        Configure B                           Configure A
        as its child                          as its parent
                        Open (P=1, A's ID)
                       -------------------> Same as configured
                                              A is B's parent
                        Open (C=1, B's ID)
    Same as configured <-------------------
      B is A's child


   A sends B a Open message with P=1 and A's ID after B is configured as
   its child on it.  B sends A a Open message with C=1 and B's ID after
   A is configured as its parent on it.

   When A receives the Open message from B and determines C=1 and the
   PCE ID of B in the message is the same as the PCE ID of the child
   locally configured, B is A's child.

   When B receives the Open message from A and determines P=1 and the
   PCE ID of A in the message is the same as the PCE ID of the parent
   locally configured, A is B's parent.

   The Open message from child B to its parent A contains B's domain,
   which is represented by a domain Sub-TLV in the H-PCE capability TLV.
   If child B is also a parent, the P flag in the TLV is set to 1.

   The PCE ID in a Open message may be represented in one of the
   following ways:

   o  The source IP address of the message (i.e., PCE session).

   o  A PCE ID Sub-TLV in the H-PCE capability TLV.

   o  An IP address Sub-TLV in the H-PCE capability TLV.

   When the IP address Sub-TLV is used, the address in the Sub-TLV MUST
   be the same as the source IP address of the PCE session.

   For a child that is a leaf, it is normally responsible for one
   domain, which is contained in the message to its parent.

   For a child that is a branch (i.e., also a parent of multiple child
   PCEs), it may be directly responsible for one domain, which is
   contained in the message to its parent.  In addition, it is
   responsible for the domains of its child PCEs.  In other words, it is
   responsible for computing paths crossing the domains through working
   together with its child PCEs.  If these domains are all areas of an

   AS, the AS is included in the message to its parent.

   A parent stores the information about each of its child PCEs
   received.  When the session to one of them is down, it removes the
   information about the child on that session.

   A child stores the information about its parent received.  When the
   session to the parent is down, it removes the information about the
   parent.

   If there already exists a session between A and B and the
   configurations on parent and child are issued on them, the procedures
   above may be executed through bringing down the existing session and
   establishing a new session between them.  Alternatively, they may
   discover each other regarding to H-PCE through using extended
   Notification messages in the same procedures as using Open messages
   described above without bringing down the existing session.

   The following new Notification-type and Notification-value are
   defined for H-PCE:

   o  Notification-type=5 (TBD): Discovery of H-PCE

      *  Notification-value=1: The information about a parent PCE or a
         child PCE.  A Notification-type=5, Notification-value=1
         indicates that the PCE sends its peer the information about it
         and a TLV containing the information is in the Notification
         object.  The format and contents of the TLV is the same as the
         H-PCE capability TLV described above.  The only difference may
         be the type of the TLV.

5.  Security Considerations

   The mechanism described in this document does not raise any new
   security issues for the PCEP protocols.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This section specifies requests for IANA allocation.
