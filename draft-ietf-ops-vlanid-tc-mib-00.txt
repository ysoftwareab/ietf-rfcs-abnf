Abstract

   This memo defines textual conventions to represent the commonly used
   Virtual Local Area Network Identifier (VLAN-ID). The intent is that
   these textual conventions (TCs) will be imported and used in MIB
   modules that would otherwise define their own representations.

1. Introduction

   Various Working Groups have defined standards-track MIB documents
   (for example [RFC2613], [RFC2674] and [RFC3318]), that contain
   objects and Textual Conventions to represent a Virtual Local Area
   Network Identifier (VLAN-ID) [IEEE.802-1Q.2003]. New definitions are
   showing up in various Internet-Drafts (for example

Internet-Draft      Textual Conventions for VLAN-ID       September 2003


   [I-D.ietf-ipcdn-qos-mib], [I-D.ietf-rmonmib-sspm-mib]). Unfortunately
   the result is a set of different definitions for the same piece of
   management information. This may lead to confusion and unnecessary
   complexity.

   This document defines a set of textual conventions (TCs) that can and
   should be (re-)used in MIB modules, so that they all represent a
   VLAN-ID in the same way.  In fact, PIB modules can and should also
   use these TCs when they need to represent a VLAN-ID.

2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

4. Security Considerations

   The MIB module contained in this memo does not define any management
   objects. Instead, it defines a set of textual conventions which may
   be used by other MIB modules to define management objects.

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written for MIB
   modules that define concrete management objects. This document has
   therefore no impact on the security of the Internet.

5. Acknowledgments

   This document was produced as a result of a review of the use of
   VLAN-ID in several MIB modules. Further investigation found that
   VLAN-ID objects were defined in a few other MIB modules. The editor
   would like to thank all who contributed to the discussion which
   resulted in this document. Specifically Les Bell, Andrew Smith, Mike
   Heard, Randy Presuhn, Dan Romascanu, Eduardo Cardona, Tom Petch,
   Juergen Schoenwaelder, Richard Woundy, Tony Jeffree and William
   Murwin. We also received input and feedback from IEEE confirming that
   the values 0 and 4095 are not used for identifying a specific VLAN-ID
   and so can be used to represent none or a wildcard Appendix A.

    Subject: RE: VLAn ID


    Bert et al -

    We have concluded that the use of 4095 as a wildcard is acceptable
    to 802.1, and we will make any necessary changes to 802.1Q in due
    course to relax the current stated restriction. However, we need
    to know whether that is all that needs to be done to 802.1Q - i.e.,
    is there any need to change our definitions of the managed objects
    in the document (Clause 12) to reflect the interpretation of 4095
    as a wildcard, or is this simply an issue for the SNMP machinery
    to handle?

    Regards,
    Tony
