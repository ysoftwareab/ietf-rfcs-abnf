Internet-Draft   Route Optimization Agent Extension      December 2009 
    

Abstract 

   Route Optimization is a very useful feature in Mobile IPv6. Mobile 
   node can communicate with correspondent node without the involvement 
   of the home agent in Route Optimization mode. But there are some 
   limitations to this feature. One problem is that the mobile node and 
   the correspondent node must be capable for Route Optimization. This 
   document introduces a Route Optimization Agent function used for 
   Route Optimization and this extension mechanism can enable Route 
   Optimization mode to be used between mobile node and simple IP node. 
   In the extension solution, the Route Optimization Agent function may 
   be implemented in LMA or MAG and the Agent entity can reflect the  
   RO-related signal messages and accomplish the Route Optimization 
   procedure on behalf of the simple IP node.

Internet-Draft   Route Optimization Agent Extension      December 2009 
    

1. Introduction 

   Mobile IPv6 protocol [RFC3775] provides a mobility extension to basic 
   IPv6 and introduces Route Optimization (RO) mechanism. Route 
   Optimization enables mobile node (MN) to establish a directly 
   connection between mobile node and correspondent node (CN) without 
   the involvement of MN's home agent (HA).  

   But Route Optimization requires mobile node and correspondent node to 
   have some certain capabilities, such as MN's transmitting Home Test 
   Init (HoTI) message, Care-of Test Init (CoTI) message and direct 
   Binding Update message to CN, and CN's reflecting Home Test (HoT) 
   message, Care-of Test Init (CoT) message and Binding Ack message to 
   MN. 

   If the correspondent node is a simple IP node without support for 
   Route Optimization, the MN with support for Route Optimization still 
   can't set up Route Optimization to this CN, as [RFC3775] specifies 
   "If a mobile node attempts to set up route optimization with a node 
   with only basic IPv6 support, an ICMP error will signal that the node 
   does not support such optimizations and communications will flow 
   through the home agent." 

   From the MN's viewpoint, the IPv6 nodes with support for MIP and IPv6 
   nodes without support for MIP are using the unified address space, so 
   the MN can't distinguish whether a correspondent node is a RO-capable 
   node or a non-RO-capable node. When the network is composed of mobile 
   IPv6 nodes, IPv6 nodes with support for Route Optimization and 
   enormous quantity of simple IPv6 nodes with support for only basic 
   IPv6 protocol, lots of Route Optimization attempts will go to a 
   failure result. 

   This document introduces an extension mechanism, which can be used 
   for IP nodes with only support for basic IPv6 protocol, to accomplish 
   the Route Optimization. 

    

2. Terminology 

   All the mobility related terms used in this document are to be 
   interpreted as defined in the Mobile IPv6 specification [RFC3775] and 
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213]. 

   This document also provides the following context-specific    
   explanation to the following terms used in this document.

   Route Optimization Agent (ROA) 

   Route Optimization Agent is the logical function entity that acts 
   reflector role in Route Optimization procedure on behalf of the 
   correspondent node. 

   Agent Binding Cache (ABC) 

   The Agent Binding Cache is the cache of binding for binding source 
   node and binding destination node. The binding source consists of 
   home address of the source node and the home address of the source 
   node and the Agent Binding Cache is cached in the mid-box (i.e. the 
   agent entity) between the source/destination node pair. 

    

3. Scenario Analysis and Use Case 

3.1. Route Optimization Requirement from Other SDO 

   Route Optimization is specified in [RFC3775] and also adopted by 
   other SDO, such as 3GPP2. 3GPP2 has specified some specific 
   requirements and feature description in 3GPP2 documents.  

   Section 4.4 "MIP6" of [X.S0011-001-D] is about MIP6 protocol and 
   Figure 13 and Figure 16 in this section illustrate the protocol 
   reference model for MIP6 Route Optimization mode. 

   Section 5.3 "Home Agent Requirements" of [X.S0011-002-D] introduces 
   the requirements of Home Agent on Route Optimization, as specified in 
   section 5.3.6 "Return Routability Support for Route Optimization", 
   "The Home Agent shall support Return Routability (RR) for Route 
   Optimization as specified in [RFC3775] with the exception that IPsec 
   is not used to protect the RR messages." 

   Section 6 "MIP6 Route Optimization" of [X.S0047-0] introduces the 
   requirements of mobile node on Route Optimization, as specified in 
   section 6.1 "MS Requirements", "The MS may support the return 
   routability procedure, binding update procedure, and packet 
   processing for the Mobile Node Operation and Correspondent Node 
   Operation, according to [RFC3775]."

3.2. Issues if the CN can't support Route Optimization 

   Mobile IPv6 provides the Route Optimization mechanism, which may be 
   used between mobile nodes with support for MIPv6 or between mobile 
   nodes and IP nodes with support for Route Optimization. 

   In other situation, if the correspondent node can't support Route 
   Optimization, the correspondent node will reply an ICMP ERROR message 
   to the mobile node who initiates the Route Optimization. 

   On the other hand, Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] provides a network-
   based mobility solution. In Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, Local Mobility 
   Anchor (LMA) and Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) can provide proxy 
   mobility management functionality for the mobile node. 

   The LMA works as the mobility anchor for the mobile node and the MAG 
   works as the mobility proxy for the mobile node,  as [RFC5213] 
   defined, LMA is "the entity that manages the mobile node's binding 
   state" while MAG is "a function on an access router that manages the 
   mobility-related signaling for a mobile node that is attached to its 
   access link". But by now the MAG is only half-function proxy for the 
   mobile node, because the MAG can only transmit mobility-related 
   signal messages for the mobile node but cannot dispose the mobility-
   related signal messages destined to the mobile node. The MAG is only 
   an active proxy function but does not implement reactive agent 
   function in current specification. The function of managing the 
   mobility-related signaling defined for MAG is not fully specified by 
   now. 

   Take the Route Optimization procedure as the example. If the mobile 
   node is setting up Route Optimization with a basic IP node which is 
   attached to the MAG, the message flow is as below:

                   Figure 1 Issue in Route Optimization. 

    

   The detailed descriptions are as follows: 

   (a) MN1 attached to Home Agent and MN2 attached to MAG, MAG runs PMIP 
       protocol for MN2, which only supports basic IP protocol. During 
       the lifetime of the session between MN1 and MN2, MN1 has no idea 
       about the capability of MN2. 

   (b~e) MN1 initiates a Route Optimization set up and sends Home Test 
         Init message to MN2. The destination address of the packet is 
         the home address of MN2 and the packet goes through HA, LMA and 
         MAG, at last arrives at MN2. 

   (f) MN2 can't recognize the Home Test Init message and replies an 
         ICMP error message to MN1.

   (g~i) MN1 sends Care-of Test Init message to MN2. The destination 
         address of the packet is the home address of MN2 and the packet 
         goes through LMA and MAG, at last arrives at MN2 too. 

   (j) MN2 can't recognize the Care-of Test Init message and replies an 
         ICMP error message to MN1. 

   (k) MN1 receives the ICMP error messages sent by MN2, has to stop 
       Route Optimization set up. 

   In this example, Home Test Init message and Care-of Test Init message 
   are both mobility-related signaling, but the MAG doesnot manage or 
   deal these messages for MN2. This miss induces the failure of Route 
   Optimization. 

    

3.3. Existing analysis and solutions 

   [RFC4889] focuses on NEMO Route Optimization and provides many 
   valuable analyses on this topic. The conclusion section (section 6) 
   shows some consideration aspects on Route Optimization: the benefits 
   a Route Optimization solution is expected to bring, the different 
   scenarios in which a Route Optimization solution applies, issues a 
   Route Optimization solution might face.  

   [RFC4889] also introduces some scenarios in section 5. When RO is 
   applied between Mobile Router and Correspondent Node, as [RFC4889] 
   states, "However, new functionality is likely to be required on the 
   Correspondent Node." 

   [HMIP-Based-Route-Optimization] introduces some scenarios and 
   solutions about Route Optimization, too. For example, Figure 11 in 
   section 3 illustrates Proxy CN case. In this case a MR takes the 
   proxy role of the correspondent node. But the solution in this 
   scenario is not introduced in detail and the solution also requires 
   the correspondent node (here is a MN but not a LFN) to support 
   Routing Header and Home Address Option. 

   This document wants to introduce a new extension solution for the 
   similar scenario. In this solution there is no requirement or new 
   functionality on the correspondent node and the agent can take all 
   the mobility management function for the correspondent node.

3.4. Use Case for Route Optimization Agent Extension 

   The use case is related to 3GPP2 network. A mobile node in 3GPP2 
   network can attempt to set up Route Optimization with a correspondent 
   node, but as mentioned above, Route Optimization may fail due to e.g. 
   CN being in 3GPP network or in PMIP domain. 

   As an approach to these issues, this document introduces Route 
   Optimization Agent functionality. The functionality allows a separate 
   network entity to manage Route Optimization-related signaling on 
   behalf of the mobile node that is attached to the network. Benefits 
   include bringing higher QoE/QoS to both the initiating and responding 
   user and reducing network resource costs. The applicable scenarios 
   include PMIP domain and fixed IPv6 nodes that only support basic IPv6 
   protocol. Possible caveats include performance issues appearing on 
   the node running Route Optimization Agent. However, similar packets 
   interception functionality is already present in e.g. Home Agent, so 
   performance loss should be acceptable for any Router-like entities. 

   The use case, taking the MAG as the Agent entity, is as below:

   The detailed descriptions are as follows: 

   (a) MN1 attached to Home Agent and MN2 attached to MAG, MAG runs PMIP 
       protocol for MN2, which only supports basic IP protocol. During 
       the lifetime of the session between MN1 and MN2, MN1 has no idea 
       about the capability of MN2.

   (b1~b3) MN1 initiates a Route Optimization set up and sends Home Test 
         Init message to MN2. The destination address of the packet is 
         the home address of MN2 and the packet goes through HA and LMA 
         and reaches MAG. 

   (c1~c2) MN1 sends Care-of Test Init message to MN2. The destination 
         address of the packet is the home address of MN2 and the packet 
         goes through LMA and reaches MAG too. 

   (d1~d3) MAG recognizes the Home Test Init message, which is a 
         mobility-related signaling, and generates a Home Test message 
         on behalf of MN2. The procedure for the MAG to generate the 
         Home Test message is as the same with CN's operation specified 
         in section 9.4.1 and section 9.4.3 of [RFC3775]. The MAG 
         transmits Home Test message to MN1 and the packet goes through 
         LMA and HA and arrives at MN1 at last. 

   (e1~e3) MAG recognizes the Care-of Test Init message, which is a 
         mobility-related signaling, and generates a Care-of Test 
         message on behalf of MN2. The procedure for the MAG to generate 
         the Care-of Test message is as the same with CN's operation 
         specified in section 9.4.2 and section 9.4.4 of [RFC3775]. The 
         MAG transmits Care-of Test message to MN1 and the packet goes 
         through LMA and arrives at MN1 at last. 

   (f1~f2) MN1 receives Home Test and Care-of Test message and sends 
         Binding Update message to the address of MN2 as specified in 
         [RFC3775]. The Binding Update message also reaches the MAG 
         which the MN2 attached to. 

   (g1~g2) MAG recognizes the Binding Update message, which is a 
         mobility-related signaling, and caches the Home Address, Care-
         of Address and bindings on behalf of MN2. The procedure is as 
         the same with CN's operation as specified in section 9.5.1 of 
         [RFC3775]. The MAG also includes the IP address of the attached 
         IP node (i.e. the destination of the Binding Update message) in 
         the Agent Binding Cache entry. The MAG transmits Binding Ack 
         message to MN1 and the packet goes through LMA and arrives at 
         MN1 at last. 

   (h) Route Optimization is achieved and Home Agent of MN1 is not 
       involved in the traffic data transport. For the traffic flow 
       between MN1 to MN2, the MAG forwards all the traffic packets 
       between MN1 and MN2, with some additional operation (specified 
       in section 4.1) implemented.

3.5. Motivation of Route Optimization Agent 

   The motivation for this extension is based on some mechanisms that 
   have been introduced in IETF. For example, Proxy ARP protocol, which 
   is specified in [RFC1027] "Using ARP to Implement Transparent Subnet 
   Gateways", has been adopted by lots of routers and gateways. 

   One basic Proxy ARP flow is as below:

                     Figure 5 Proxy ARP message flow. 

   In this case, when host A wants to send IP packets to host B, if host 
   A knows only the IP address of host B but doesn't know the MAC 
   address of host B, host A need send out a ARP request message and 
   broadcast the message in MAC layer. The gateway will receive this ARP 
   request, whose destination IP address is the IP address of host B. 
   The destination of this message is not the gateway, but the gateway 
   knows that the destination (i.e. host B) is attached to itself and 
   also knows the destination can't receive this ARP request, so in this 
   situation, the gateway replies an ARP reply message for host B. In 
   the proxy ARP reply message, the source IP address is the IP address 
   of host B and the source MAC address is the MAC address of the e0 
   interface in the gateway. When host A receives this proxy ARP reply 
   message, it can know how to send IP packets to host B. Host A will 
   send IP packets to the gateway (i.e. the e0 interface) and the 
   gateway will forward these packets to host B. 

   Similar to this case, when the MAG in the PMIP domain receives some 
   mobility-related signal messages (e.g. HoTI, CoTI and BU) destined to 
   the mobile node that is attached to its access link, the MAG can also 
   know that the mobile node can't recognize these messages. This 
   judgment may depend on the policy profile of the mobile node, the 
   configuration variables of the MAG, or other manners. Since the MAG 
   is the mobility proxy of the mobile node and can manage the mobility-
   related signaling for the mobile node, it is reasonable for the MAG 
   to dispose these messages on behalf of the mobile node. The Route 
   Optimization Agent function MAY be implemented in this situation.

3.6. Requirements on Route Optimization Agent 

   The Route Optimization Agent function introduced in this document 
   depends on the operation of the network entity. The requirements of 
   the Route Optimization Agent function include following: 

   R1: Route Optimization Agent can recognize mobility-relate signal 
   messages. When the Route Optimization Agent receives mobility-related 
   signaling destined to the MN that is attached to the network, the 
   Route Optimization Agent MAY intercept the messages and reply 
   response messages for the mobile node. Since all the mobility-related 
   signal messages contain mobility header and MH Type field, the Route 
   Optimization Agent can easily fulfill this requirement. 

   R2: Route Optimization Agent can achieve the operation of CN role for 
   Return Routability and Route Optimization specified in [RFC3775]. 
   [RFC5213] has specified some mechanisms for LMA/MAG to provide 
   network-based mobility management function. For example, the MAG can 
   create and maintain the Binding Update List as a mobile node does, 
   and the LMA can create and maintain the Binding Cache for the mobile 
   node. It is easy to expand the MAG to create and maintain an Agent 
   Binding Cache Entry to meet this requirement, and it is also easy to 
   expand the LMA to create and maintain Agent Binding Cache to hold the 
   binding between the mobile node and the correspondent node. The 
   LMA/MAG MAY do more agent operation than specified in [RFC5213] as 
   specified in this document. 

   R3: Route Optimization Agent can modify the outgoing packets and 
   route the packets to the optimized route depending on the created 
   Agent Binding Cache. The Route Optimization Agent MAY check whether 
   an Agent Binding Cache entry exists and if the Agent Binding Cache 
   entry exists the Route Optimization Agent modifies the destination 
   address in the IP header and includes Type 2 Routing Header in the 
   outgoing packets. The Route Optimization Agent should set the 
   destination address to the care-of address of the destined mobile 
   node and set the Home Address field in the Type 2 Routing Header to 
   the home address of the destined mobile node. 

   R4: Route Optimization Agent can modify the source address of the 
   incoming packets depending on the created Agent Binding Cache. The 
   Route Optimization Agent MAY check whether an Agent Binding Cache 
   entry exists and if yes, the care-of address in the source address of 
   the packet is replaced by the home address of the remote mobile node 
   and the Home Address Option contained in the packet is removed.

4. Solution and Operation Consideration 

4.1. Route Optimization Agent Operation 

   The Route Optimization Agent is a function that typically runs on  
   LMA, MAG, Mobile Router or even the fixed Access Router for wired IP 
   node. The Route Optimization Agent transfers all the IP packets from 
   or destined to the simple IP node that is attached to the network. 
   However, some more operations are defined in this document for the 
   expansion solution. 

   The operations for Route Optimization Agent consist of following: 

   o  Intercepting and disposing the mobility-related signaling destined 
       to the attached IP node. 

   o  Creating, maintaining and deleting the Agent Binding Cache for the 
       IP node to which the initiator wants to establish or release a 
       Route Optimization. 

   o  Destination Address replacement and Type 2 Routing Header 
       insertion for the outgoing traffic from the attached IP node. 

   o  Source Address replacement and Home Address Option elimination for 
       the incoming traffic destined to the attached IP node. 

   o  Security operation for the Return Routability Procedure and Route 
       Optimization. The Route Optimization Agent SHOULD works as 
       specified in section 5.2 and section 15.4 of [RFC5213] for the 
       role of correspondent node. 

   The introduced Route Optimization Agent function in the reflector may 
   be independent of the active Proxy Mobile IP function that specified 
   in [RFC5213]. 

    

4.1.1. Incoming Flow Transmission 

   For the incoming flow (i.e. from the remote IP node to the IP node 
   that is attached to the Route Optimization Agent), the Route 
   Optimization Agent needs to parse the IP header to check the packet 
   type as soon as it receives the packet from the remote IP node.

Internet-Draft   Route Optimization Agent Extension      December 2009 
    

   If the IP packet received from other IP node doesn't contain mobility 
   header, i.e. the IP packet is not mobility-related signaling, the 
   Route Optimization Agent entity needs to additionally examine the 
   Destination Option extension header of the packet. If the Home 
   Address Option (Option type = 201) is contained in the packet, the 
   Route Optimization Agent entity needs to examine its Agent Binding 
   Cache for an entry for the 3-Tuple address set (i.e.  the home 
   address, the source address and the destination address of the IP 
   packet). If a corresponding Agent Binding Cache entry exists, it 
   means Route Optimization has been established between the IP node 
   pair. In this situation the Route Optimization Agent MAY replace the 
   care-of address in the source address of the packet with the home 
   address of the remote mobile node, remove the Home Address Option and 
   forward the modified packet to the attached IP node. If no mobility 
   header and no Home Address Option are contained in the packet, the 
   Route Optimization Agent SHOULD forward the packet to the attached IP 
   node without any modification. If no mobility header is contained in 
   the packet, and the Home Address Option is contained, but no Agent 
   Binding Cache entry exists, the Route Optimization Agent MUST drop 
   this packet. (Note: This case follows the rule of [RFC3775]). 

   If the IP packet received from other IP node contains the mobility 
   header, the Route Optimization Agent needs to further check the MH 
   type field in the mobility header. The Route Optimization Agent MAY 
   execute the expansion solution for these mobility-related packets.  

   If the received packet is Home Test Init Message, the Route 
   Optimization Agent stops transferring the packet to the attached IP 
   node and executes the operation as specified for the correspondent 
   node role in section 9.4.1 and 9.4.3 of [RFC3775]. 

   If the received packet is Care-of Test Init Message, the Route 
   Optimization Agent stops transferring the packet to the attached IP 
   node and executes the operation as specified for the correspondent 
   node role in section 9.4.2 and 9.4.4 of [RFC3775]. 

   If the received packet is Binding Update message, the Route 
   Optimization Agent stops transferring the packet to the attached IP 
   node and executes the operation as specified for the correspondent 
   node role in section 9.5.1 and 9.5.4 of [RFC3775]. The exception is 
   that the Route Optimization Agent should create or update Agent 
   Binding Cache entity and include the destination address of the BU 
   message in the Agent Binding Cache entry.

4.1.2. Outgoing Flow Transmission 

   For the outgoing (i.e. from the IP node that is attached to the Route 
   Optimization Agent to the remote IP node) flow, the Route 
   Optimization Agent needs to examine its Agent Binding Cache for an 
   entry for the address pair (i.e. the source address and the 
   destination address of the IP packet) as soon as it receives packet 
   from the attached IP node. 

   If no corresponding Agent Binding Cache entry exists, the Route 
   Optimization Agent MUST forward the packet to the remote IP node 
   without any modification. 

   If a corresponding Agent Binding Cache entry exists, it means Route 
   Optimization has been established between the IP node pair. The Route 
   Optimization Agent MAY use a type 2 routing header to route the 
   packet to the destination node by way of its care-of address. 

   The Route Optimization Agent may implement following operation for 
   Route Optimization: 

   o  The Route Optimization Agent inserts the Type 2 routing header and 
       sets the Home Address in the routing header to the remote mobile 
       node's home address (the original destination address to which 
       the packet was being sent). 

   o  The Route Optimization Agent sets the Destination Address in the 
       packet's header to the remote mobile node's care-of address 
       copied from the Agent Binding Cache entry. 

   o  The Route Optimization Agent operation is achieved and the packet 
       is transferred as described in other specification. 

   However, the Route Optimization Agent MUST NOT do this in the 
   following cases: 

   o  When forwarding an IPv6 Neighbor Discovery packet. 

   o  When forwarding the packets that are noted in Section 6.1 of 
   [RFC3775]. 

    

   Note that the implementation creates some additional requirements for 
   path MTU discovery since the modification changes the packet size. 
   The Route Optimization Agent should choose an appropriate way to 
   indicate the attached IP node this situation.

4.1.3. Conceptual Data Structures 

   This document adds Agent Binding Cache to the Route Optimization 
   Agent entity. When the Route Optimization Agent receives the Binding 
   Update message destined to the attached IP node the Route 
   Optimization Agent creates or updates the Agent Binding Cache entry 
   and includes the destination address of the Binding Update message in 
   the Agent Binding Cache entry. 

   The newly introduced Agent Binding Cache entry for this extension 
   contains two additional fields than the Binding Cache entry data 
   structure specified in section 9.1 of [RFC3775]. 

   o  The Agent Binding Cache entry contains a flag indicating either 
       this is an Agent Binding Cache entry (This document defines) or a 
       normal Binding Cache entry ([RFC3775] defines).  

   o  The Agent Binding Cache entry contains a destination IP address, 
       which is the true destination of the intercepted Binding Update 
       message. 

   Each Agent Binding Cache entry is mapped with a 3-Tuple address set 
   (i.e. HoA of MN, CoA of MN and IP address of CN). The incoming packet 
   lookup key is the source address and the destination address of the 
   IP packet and the Home Address Option contained in the packet. For 
   the incoming packet, if the HoA of MN, CoA of MN and CN address all 
   matches, then the Agent Binding Cache entry is found. The outgoing 
   packet lookup key is the destination address and the source address 
   of the IP packet. For the outgoing packet, if the HoA of MN and CN 
   address pair matches, then the Agent Binding Cache entry is found. 
   Route Optimization may be applied between the IP node pair in these 
   two cases. 

    

4.1.4. Configuration Variables 

   A configuration variable, EnableRouteOptimizationAgent is defined in 
   this document for Route Optimization Agent function. 

   This variable is available in Route Optimization Agent entity. When 
   the value of this variable is 1, the Route Optimization Agent 
   function is enabled. When the value of this variable is 0, the Route 
   Optimization Agent function is disabled.

Internet-Draft   Route Optimization Agent Extension      December 2009 
    

   The default value of EnableRouteOptimizationAgent is 0. 

    

4.2. LMA Operation 

   The Route Optimization Agent function may be implemented in LMA 
   entity. 

   When the LMA works as the Route Optimization Agent entity, LMA should 
   follow the operation specified in section 4.1 of this document, and 
   other network elements such as MAG, CN, MN and the HA of the MN are 
   not impacted and follow the operation described in other 
   specifications. 

    

4.3. MAG Operation 

   The Route Optimization Agent function may be implemented in MAG 
   entity. 

   When the MAG works as the Route Optimization Agent entity, MAG should 
   follow the operation specified in section 4.1 of this document, and 
   other network elements such as LMA, CN, MN and the HA of the MN are 
   not impacted and follow the operation described in other 
   specifications. 

   If the Route Optimization Agent function is implemented in the MAG 
   and inter-MAG handover happens simultaneously, the MAG SHOULD proceed 
   as specified in section 4.3.1 and 4.3.2 of this document. 

    

4.3.1. Inter-MAG Handover with Agent Takeover 

   If the Agent function can be implemented in the new MAG (The previous 
   MAG can get this information during the message exchange between pMAG 
   and nMAG), the previous MAG SHOULD try to transfer the Agent Binding 
   Cache entry to the new MAG as part of the context. The 3-Tuple 
   address set (i.e. HoA of MN, CoA of MN and IP address of CN) MUST be 
   transferred to the new MAG. Note some Node Keys in the previous MAG 
   are not shared with other entities so the new MAG gets no binding 
   management keys from the previous MAG. In this situation, the new MAG 
   SHOULD send the Binding Refresh Request message to the remote mobile 
   IP node as specified in [RFC3775] to refresh the agent binding. When 
   the remote mobile IP node restarts the Return Routability and Route

Internet-Draft   Route Optimization Agent Extension      December 2009 
    

   Optimization as specified in [RFC3775], the new MAG will take over 
   the Agent role for the attached IP node. 

    

4.3.2. Inter-MAG Handover with Agent Revocation 

   If the new MAG does not support Route Optimization Agent function, 
   the function is disabled or the 3-Tuple address set (i.e. HoA of MN, 
   CoA of MN and IP address of CN) can't be transferred to the new MAG 
   (The previous MAG can get this information during the message 
   exchange between pMAG and nMAG), the previous MAG SHOULD send the 
   Binding Revocation Indication message to the remote mobile node as 
   specified in [CN-Binding-Revocation] to revoke the agent binding. 
   When the remote mobile IP node releases the correspondent node 
   binding as specified in [CN-Binding-Revocation], the session between 
   the remote mobile IP node and the attached IP node fallbacks to the 
   Bidirectional Tunneling mode. 

    

5. Security Considerations 

   The extension in this document is just to expand the scope of the 
   mobility management to cover the reactive mobility management agent 
   function, such as the acceptance of Route Optimization, and the Route 
   Optimization Agent still follows the principle that providing 
   network-based mobility management to the IP node that is attached to 
   its access link. So this extension brings no new security issue to 
   mobility management. 

   But this extension requires the Route Optimization Agent to implement 
   packet inspection on the packets destined to the IP node, which would 
   impact the performance of the Agent entity and maybe bring some 
   security risk. By the time when this document is written, no explicit 
   security problem has been found and the accurate security 
   consideration needs to be further studied. 

    

6. IANA Considerations 

   This document has no actions for IANA.

APPENDIX A: Future Extension and Use Case 

A.1. Agent Extension for Mobile Router 

   This solution can also be applied in Network Mobility (NEMO) 
   extension, where the Mobile Router provides mobility management for 
   IP node with only support for basic IP. The extension for NEMO is as 
   below:
