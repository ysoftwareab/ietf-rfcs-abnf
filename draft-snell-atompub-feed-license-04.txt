1.  Introduction

   This document specifies a mechanism that allows feed publishers the
   ability to associate copyright licenses with the informational
   content of an entry.  Licenses associated using these mechanisms MAY
   or MAY not be machine readable and are intended to communicate the
   various rights and obligations others may have with regards to given
   resource.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119], as
   scoped to those conformance targets.

   In this specification, "entry" refers to an atom:entry element.

   In this specification, "feed" refers to an Atom Feed Document.

   In this specification, "head section" refers to the children of a
   feed's document-wide metadata container; e.g., the child elements of
   the atom:feed element in an Atom Feed Document.

   In this specification, "link" refers to the atom:link element.

   In this specification, "link relation" refers to the value of the
   atom:link element's rel attribute.


3.  The 'license' link relation

   The 'license' link relation is used to associate a copyright license
   with Atom Feed and Entry Documents.

   o  atom:entry elements MAY contain any number of 'license' link
      relations.
   o  atom:feed elements MAY contain any number of 'license' link
      relations.
   o  atom:source elements MAY contain any number of 'license' link
      relations.
   o  atom:entry, atom:feed and atom:source elements MUST NOT contain
      more than one 'license' link relation with the same combination of
      href, type and hreflang attribute values.

   License link relations appearing as children of the atom:feed or
   atom:source elements apply only to the informational content of the

   containing element, and not to the informational content of any
   associated atom:entry elements.  That is, the presence of a license
   link in the head section of a feed document does not extend a license
   over the various contained entry elements.

   For example
     <feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
       <id>http://www.example.com/myfeed</id>
       <title>My Example Feed</title>
       <updated>2005-07-28T12:00:00Z</updated>
       <link href="http://www.example.com/myfeed" />
       <link rel="license"
             type="text/html"
             href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/" />
       <author><name>James</name></author>
       <entry>
         <id>tag:entries.com,2005:1</td>
         <title>My original entry</title>
         <link href="http://www.example.com/entries/1" />
         <summary>This is my original entry</summary>
         <link rel="license"
               type="text/html"
               href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/" />
       </entry>
     </feed>

   Multiple license link relations MAY be used to indicate that the
   informational content has been published under multiple copright
   licenses.  In such instances, each of the linked licenses is
   considered to be mutually exclusive of the others.  That is to say,
   for example, if an entry contains license links to both a Creative
   Commons License and the General Public License (GPL), the
   informational content is considered to be licensed either as
   "Creative Commons OR GPL" as opposed to "Creative Commons AND GPL".
   If multiple license link relations are specified, each SHOULD contain
   a title attribute that specifies a human readable label for each
   license link.


4.  Security Considerations

   Feeds using the mechanisms described here could be crafted in such a
   way as to cause a consumer to initiate excessive (or even an unending
   sequence of) network requests, causing denial of service (either to
   the consumer, the target server, and/or intervening networks).  This
   risk can be mitigated by requiring user intervention after a certain
   number of requests, or by limiting requests either according to a
   hard limit, or with heuristics.

Internet-Draft                Feed License                 December 2005


   Malicious interediaries could also attempt to change the licensing of
   an atom:feed, atom:entry or atom:source by substituting a new URI for
   the 'license' link relation.  This risk can be mitigated by digitally
   signing the elements in which the 'license' link relations appear.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines one new Atom link relation type to be
   registered in the IANA Registry of Link Relations as defined by
   [RFC4287].
       Attribute Value: license
       Description: (see section 3)
       Expected display characteristics: (see section 3)
       Security considerations: (see section 4)
