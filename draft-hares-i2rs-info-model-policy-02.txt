                An Information Model for Network policy
                 draft-hares-i2rs-info-model-policy-02

Abstract

   This document introduces an information model for network policies.
   This model operates as policy model that can be linked to other
   information model such as the I2RS RIB information model.

   Some applications that utilize the services of I2RS client may
   require specific set of data in response to network events or
   conditions based on pre-established rules.  In order to reduce the
   data flow through the network, the I2RS client needs to signal the
   I2RS agent to filter some of the collected data or events prior to
   transmission, or group the data prior to transmission to the i2rs
   client.  This functionality is necessary to meet the requirements
   i2rs enabled services which include service-layer routing
   improvements, and control of traffic flows and exit points.

   The information model is based on extensible information model for
   representing policies, for example, the Policy Core Information Model
   (PCIM) (RFC3060), and an extension to this model to address the need
   for QoS management, called the Quality of Service (QoS) Policy
   Information Model (QPIM)(RFC3644) and policy based routing.

1.  Introduction

   The Interface to the Routing System (I2RS) provides read and write
   access to the information and state within the routing process within
   routing elements.  The I2RS client interacts with one or more I2RS
   agents to collect information from network routing systems.

   Processing of collected information at the I2RS agent may require the
   I2RS Agent to filter certain information or group pieces of
   information in order to reduce the data flow through the network to
   the I2RS client.  Some applications that that utilize the services of
   I2RS client may also wish to require specific data in response to
   network events or conditions based on pre-established rules.  This

   functionality is necessary to meet the requirements of i2rs enabled
   services which include service-layer routing improvements, and
   control of traffic flows and exit points.

   This document introduces a basic information model for network
   policies.  This policy model can be linked with other information
   models such as the I2RS RIB informational model
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-info-model] as a generic policy module.  This
   basic policy model can be easily extended beyond the basic functions.
   The [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture] suggests that associated with the
   the i2RS RIB model there will be "Policy-based Routing (ACLs)" and
   RIB "policy controls".  These basic policy functions can operate as
   part of this functional blocks providing the basic model for policy
   operators.  This model can also be considered as the substance of the
   policy templates.

   The basic but extendable policy model is a product of the industry
   approach to I2RS.  The initial I2RS work is focusing on the initial
   RIB module, and basic functions to make the initial RIB model
   function within real networks.  Subsequent drafts will provide
   building blocks upon this policy model that can be used to create
   network functions.

   This information model leverages previous work done on extensible
   information model for representing policies, for example, the Policy
   Core Information Model (PCIM) [RFC3060] [RFC3060], and an extension
   to this model to address the need for QoS management, called the
   Quality of Service (QoS) Policy Information Model (QPIM) [RFC3644]
   [RFC3644].

   Most policy within routing and forwarding systems has become
   hierarchical with individual specific policies being grouped as a set
   policy.  The hierarchical policy rule definition enhances policy
   readability and reusability.  Groups of network policies have labels
   to aid operational use.  Named groups of policy are easily identified
   and reused as blocks.

   The information model contains the following three components:

   Policy Group

      Policy is described by a set of policy rules that may be grouped
      into subsets.  A Policy group is used to provide a hierarchical
      policy definition that provides the model context or scope for
      sub-rule actions.  The model context includes identity, scope,
      role, precedence, priority and security model.  In a policy group
      policy rules and policy groups can be nested within other policy
      rules.

   Network-Policy

      contains a generic network policy model.  It can be thought of as
      a coherent set of rules to administer, manage, and control access
      to network resources and defines a network policy at its most
      general level of abstraction.  It models aspects such as actions
      and conditions that constitute a policy element relationship, as
      well as operators contained in the both condition and action that
      can either be used to overwrite an old value of the variable or
      imply match relationship.  Policies vary in level of abstraction,
      for example policy at parent level or policy at child level.  The
      model therefore allows to show relationships between policies, as
      well as dependencies between condition and action across policy.

   Local Config

      defines information kept that kept in policy database that is
      leveraged by CLI, SNMP, NetConf.

1.1.  Currently Out of Scope for I2RS

   An I2RS client may also interact with other elements of the policy
   and provisioning system to retrieve policy to transmit to an I2RS
   agent to be use in processing collected information, or to pass to
   policy information bases (PIBs) within the routing system.  How the
   I2RS client interacts with the policy and provision systems is
   currently outside the scope of I2RS.

   I2RS architecture allows multiple I2RS Clients to communicate with
   the same agent I2RS agent, but requires that only one I2RS client has
   write control over one element.  Specification on how the I2RS
   Clients handle multiple client interactions it out of scope at this
   time.  The i2rs-architecture document specifies in section x.x that
   I2RS clients should avoid writing the same element.  In the future,
   the I2RS WG may decide to specify these interactions.  Therefore,
   this document's policy information allows for extensions that will
   allow multiple clients.

3.  Network Policy Model Overview

   I2RS needs its own implicit and explicit policy.  This section
   provides an overview of the network policy model.  The network policy
   model is defined by the following components, whose relationship is
   roughly depicted in the figure below.

   PolicySet, is introduced to provide an abstraction for a set of
   rules.  It is derived from Policy, and it is inserted into the
   inheritance hierarchy above both PolicyGroup and PolicyRule.  This
   reflects the additional structural flexibility and semantic
   capability of both subclasses.

   Policy Rule is represented by semantics "If Condition then Action",
   therefore condition and action comprise Policy Rule model.  Condition
   models the elementary match operation "<variable> match <value>".
   Action models the elementary set operation.  "SET <variable> TO
   <value>".  In Condition model, the 'Match' operator is usually
   implied while in the action model, the 'Set' operator is explicitly
   used.

   The Local Config Component is extended from Policy Rule and contains
   a set of local policy state related to I2RS operation that the I2RS
   agent controls.  The local system's local policy state linked to a
   particular information base (E.g. I2RS RIB) may have a write scope
   that one or more clients may write.  The same write scope with that
   of one or more clients using an agent.  An agent must check to
   determine if a local configuration state overlaps with existing
   installed state.

   The Policy Based Routing Rule is also extended from Policy Rule and
   Contain a set of condition, action and attributes that are inherited
   from Policy Group Component.  Routing decisions in policy based
   routing are based on several criteria beyond destination address,
   such as packet size, application, protocol used, and identity of the
   end system.

4.  Network Policy Information Model

   This section specifies the network policy information model in
   Routing Backus-Naur Form (RBNF, [RFC5511]).  It also provides
   diagrams of the main entities that the information model is comprised
   of.

4.1.  The Policy Group Component

   In order to provide hierarchical policy definition and associate
   policy rule with other constraint, the basic policy group model needs
   to be defined.  The corresponding extensions are introduced in a
   component, whose structure is informally depicted in the following
   diagram.

   The basic information model works as follows: Within the policy group
   information model, hierarchy is used to model context or scope for
   the sub-rule actions.  A policy group contains Identity, scope,
   priority,precedence, policy rule and policy group.  Policy rule or
   policy group can be nested into policy group.  Policy rule can
   inherit context from policy group as properties and also policy rule
   can have its own properties, eg., enabled, mandatory, usage
   properties.

   A more formal depiction in RBNF format follows below:

      <Policy-Group> ::= <Identity>
                         <Role>
                         <priority>

      <Scope> ::= <Read-Scope> |<Write-Scope>

      <Role> ::= <Resource> | <Scope>

      <Policy-Group-Extension> ::= <>
       ...

   The elements of the Policy Group information model are as follows:

   o  Each policy group is captured in its own list, distinguished via a
      identity, role, priority, precedence.

   o  A policy group has a certain role, such as resource or scope.  A
      policy group can even have multiple roles simultaneously.  The
      role, are captured in the list of "role" component.

   o  A policy role has a certain Scope, such as read scope or write
      scope.  A policy group can even have multiple scope
      simultaneously.  The scope, or scopes, are captured in the list of
      "scope" components.

   o  A policy has a certain priority, such as priority 0-255.  A policy
      can only have one priority.  The priority is captured in the list
      of "priority" component.

   o  A policy rule can inherit properties (e.g.,
      identity,role,priority, precedence) from policy group.  A policy
      rule also can have its own properties, e.g., enabled, mandatory,
      usage.

   o  The policy, policy group elements can be extended with policy-
      specific components (policy-extensions, policy-group-extension
      respectively).

4.2.  The Network-Policy Rule Component

   The following diagram contains an informal graphical depiction of the
   main elements of the information model:

        +--------+...........:
        |Operator|
        +--------+

   Roughly speaking, the basic information model works as follows: A
   policy rule contains conditions and actions.  Each condition or each
   action in turn contains operator.  A operator connects variable and
   value in the action or condition.  Condition can map onto and be
   supported by other condition, while action can map onto and be
   supported by other actions.  Policy rule can map onto other, policy
   rules.

   The information model for the Network-policy component is more
   formally shown in the following diagram.

   o  Policy rule inherit scope from policy group.  A policy role has a
      certain Scope, such as read scope or write scope.  A policy rule
      can even have multiple scope simultaneously.  The scope, or
      scopes, are captured in the list of "scope" components.

   o  Furthermore, a policy rule contains conditions and actions, each
      captured in their own list.

   o  A condition contains a variable and a value and use a match
      operator, to connect variable with value.  An examples of an
      operator might be a" IP ADDRESS AS RESOLVED BYDNS" or "Set to a
      member".  Also, a condition can in turn map onto other condition
      in an underlay policy.  This is captured in list"supporting-
      condition".

   o  An action contains a variable and a value.  An action uses Set
      operator to connect variable with value.  Analogous to a node, an
      action can in turn map onto other actions in an underlay policy.
      This is captured in list "supporting-action".

   o  The policy, condition, action and operator elements can be
      extended with policy-specific components (policy-extensions,
      condition-extension, action-extension and operator-extension
      respectively).

4.3.  The Policy Based Routing Rule Component

4.3.1.  Policy based Routing Overview

   Policy based Routing is a technique used to make routing decisions
   based on policies set by the network administrator.  PBR enables
   network administrator to forward the packet based on other criteria
   than the destination address in the packet, which is used to lookup
   an entry in the routing table.

   The policy based routing problem can be viewed as a resource
   allocation problem that incorporates business decision.

   Policy based routing provides many benefits, including cost saving,
   load balancing and basic QoS.

   Routing decisions in policy based routing are based on several
   criteria beyond destination address, such as packet size,
   application, protocol used, and identity of the end system.

   Policy constraints are applied before applying QoS constraints since
   policy constraint overrides QoS constraint.

   Policy constraints may be exchanged by routing protocols while
   updating routing information.

   Policy based routing MUST tackle the following difficult questions:

   o  How is policy management strategy selected?  Centralized or
      distributed.

   o  At which point in a network domain are policy constraints checked
      and enforced? i.e., policy coverage, here policy constraint can be
      exchanged by routing protocol?

   o  How are policy constraints exchanged within a domain?

   o  How is policy data stored, refreshed and retrieved from policy
      repository?

   o  How are policy rule conflicts avoided?

4.3.2.  PBR Rule Component

   A PBR rule is constructed using condition, action and attributes that
   are inherited from Policy Group Component.

4.3.3.  Relationship between PBR Rule Model and RIB Information Model

   As descried in [I.D-ietf-i2rs-rib-info-model], Routing instance
   contains a collection of RIBs, interfaces, and routing parameters.

   o  The set of interfaces indicates which interfaces are associated
      with this routing instance.

   o  The RIBs specify how incoming traffic is to be forwarded based on
      destination.

   o  the routing parameters control the information in the RIBs/PIBs.

Internet-Draft                IM for policy                   March 2014


   PIB and RIB can not be used at the same time

   o  If a router doesn't support policy based routing, a router MUST
      use rib and MUST not use PIB.

   o  If a router supports policy based routing,

      *  PIB is used if several criteria beyond destination address is
         matched.

      *  RIB is used if several criteria beyond destination address is
         not matched.

   Policy constraints information either comes from RSVP,BGP/IGP, or
   comes from manual configuration or policy configuration tool.
   Therefore PIB may has the following field:

   o  Interface-list: The interface list contains a list of identifiers,
      with each identifier uniquely identifying an interface.

   o  Origin: an indication used to identify from which protocols (e.g.,
      ISIS, OSPF, BGP, I2RS, CLI etc.) the policy based route is.

4.4.  The Local Config Component

   The Local Config Component is the information links to the policy
   functions associated with a information model it is linked to.  This
   component defines a set of groupings with auxiliary information
   required and shared by those other components.

   Since the I2RS RIB model is the only currently agreed upon model, an
   example from this model may be helpful.  The I2RS RIB model contains
   a RIB definition of routing instance that has 0-N interfaces and 1-N
   RIBs.  Each RIB contains a set of routes.  This policy operates on
   the elements of I2RS RIB model by combining one of the elements
   defined in the I2RS RIB model (Routing instance 1, RIB 1, route-
   attribute) within the context of a policy rule.  The
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture] shows this as the RIB Policy Controls
   that impact the policy routing.  The I2RS agent may only collect
   information on this RIB.  On Write, the RIB Policy Rules may
   determine what portion of the Policy-Based RIBs are altered to
   provide the early exit or service routing features needed by the I2RS
   client.

   The key benefit of this Policy Information Model is that it provides
   a common model of interactions of policy which can be saved as
   templates, and then enacted for specific functions associated with
   another model.  The policy element an identity, scope, role, and

   security model.  This allows the specific element to be easily tailor
   to identified by operations, enable for specific operations (via
   scope and role), and at a correct security level.  As the example
   demonstrates, this blends with the I2RS RIB model to set conditions
   and actions.  Additional drafts will show that it provides other
   service routing.

      configuration policy is captured in its own level, distinguished
      via a policy identity.

   o  A local policy rule inherit scope from policy group.  A local
      policy rule has a certain Scope, such as read scope or write
      scope.  A local policy rule can even have multiple scope
      simultaneously.  The scope, or scopes, are captured in the list of
      "scope" components.

   o  Furthermore, a local policy contains conditions and actions, each
      captured in their own list.

   o  A condition contains a variable and a value and use a match
      operator, to connect variable with value.  An examples of an
      operator might be a" IP ADDRESS AS RESOLVED BYDNS" or "Set to a
      member".  Also, a condition can in turn map onto other condition
      in an underlay policy.  This is captured in list "supporting-
      condition".

   o  An action contains a variable and a value.  An action uses Set
      operator to connect variable with value.  Analogous to a node, an
      action can in turn map onto other actions in an underlay policy.
      This is captured in list "supporting-action".

   o  The local policy, condition, action and operator elements can be
      extended with policy-specific components (condition-extension,
      action-extension and operator-extension respectively).

   Drafts that specify examples for this blended I2RS model are:

   o  An Traffic balancing using the I2RS RIB Model [draft-hares-i2rs-
      TE-exit-balance]

   o  Utilizing BGP Information regarding Service Chaining [draft-hares-
      i2rs-bgp-chains]

   o  Information model for service topology [draft-hares-i2rs-info-
      model-service-topo]

   o  In future revision of I2rs, this may link to other I2RS
      information models or linked through the I2RS agent to things
      configured by the CLI, SNMP, or via the NETCONF interface.
