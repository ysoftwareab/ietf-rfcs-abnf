  <h1 id="rfc.section.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> Introduction</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">Many networking technologies, applications, or services, are distributed in nature, and their performance may be impacted by IP impairments, server capacity, congestion and other factors. It is important to measure the performance of applications and services to ensure that quality objectives are being met and to support problem diagnosis. Standardized metrics help to ensure that performance measurement is implemented consistently and facilitate interpretation and comparison.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">There are at least three phases in the development of performance standards. They are:</p>
<p></p>

<ol>
<li>Definition of a Performance Metric and its units of measure</li>
<li>Specification of a method of measurement</li>
<li>Specification of the reporting format</li>
</ol>

<p> During the development of metrics, it is often useful to define performance objectives and expected value ranges. However, this is not defined as part of the metric specification. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">The intended audience for this document includes, but is not limited to, IETF participants who write Performance Metrics documents in the IETF, reviewers of such documents, and members of the Performance Metrics Directorate.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1.1">1.1.</a> Background and Motivation</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.1">Previous IETF work related to reporting of application Performance Metrics includes the "Real-time Application Quality-of-Service Monitoring (RAQMON) Framework" <a href="#RFC4710">[RFC4710]</a>, which extends the remote network monitoring (RMON) family of specifications to allow real-time quality-of-service (QoS) monitoring of various applications that run on devices such as IP phones, pagers, Instant Messaging clients, mobile phones, and various other handheld computing devices. Furthermore, the "RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)" <a href="#RFC3611">[RFC3611]</a> and the "SIP RTCP Summary Report Protocol" <a href="#RFC6035">[RFC6035]</a> are protocols that support the real-time reporting of Voice over IP and other applications running on devices such as IP phones and mobile handsets.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.2">The IETF is also actively involved in the development of reliable transport protocols, such as <a href="#RFC0793">TCP</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC0793]</cite> or <a href="#RFC4960">SCTP</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC4960]</cite>, which would affect the relationship between IP performance and application performance.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.3">Thus there is a gap in the currently chartered coverage of IETF Working Groups (WG): development of Performance Metrics for protocols above and below the IP-layer that can be used to characterize performance on live networks.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.4">Similarly to the "Guidelines for Considering Operations and Management of New Protocols and Protocol Extensions" <a href="#RFC5706">[RFC5706]</a>, which is the reference document for the IETF Operations Directorate, this document should be consulted as part of the new Performance Metric review by the members of the Performance Metrics Directorate.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.1.2">1.2.</a> Organization of this document</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.1">This document is divided in two major sections beyond the "Purpose and Scope" section. The first is a definition and description of a Performance Metric and its key aspects. The second defines a process to develop these metrics that is applicable to the IETF environment.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> Terminology</h1>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.2.1">2.1.</a> Performance Metrics Directorate</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.1">The Performance Metrics Directorate is a directorate provides guidance for Performance Metrics development in the IETF.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.2">The Performance Metrics Directorate should be composed of experts in the performance community, potentially selected from the IPPM, BMWG, and PMOL WGs.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.2.2">2.2.</a> Quality of Service</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.1">Quality of Service (QoS) is defined similarly to the ITU "QoS experienced/perceived by customer/user (QoE)" <a href="#E.800">E.800</a> <cite title="NONE">[E.800]</cite>, i.e.: "Totality of characteristics of a telecommunications service that bear on its ability to satisfy stated and implied needs of the user of the service." </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.2.3">2.3.</a> Quality of Experience</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.1">Quality of Experience (QoE) is defined in a similar way to the ITU "QoS experienced/perceived by customer/user (QoE)" <a href="#E.800">E.800</a> <cite title="NONE">[E.800]</cite>, i.e.: "a statement expressing the level of quality that customers/users believe they have experienced." </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.2">NOTE 1 - The level of QoS experienced and/or perceived by the customer/user may be expressed by an opinion rating.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.3">NOTE 2 - QoE has two main components: quantitative and qualitative. The quantitative component can be influenced by the complete end-to-end system effects (including user devices and network infrastructure).  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.4">NOTE 3 - The qualitative component can be influenced by user expectations, ambient conditions, psychological factors, application context, etc.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.5">NOTE 4 - QoE may also be considered as QoS delivered, received, and interpreted by a user with the pertinent qualitative factors influencing his/her perception of the service.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.2.4">2.4.</a> Performance Metric</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.4.p.1">A quantitative measure of performance, specific to an IETF-specified protocol or specific to an application transported over an IETF-specified protocol. Examples of Performance Metrics are: the FTP response time for a complete file download, the DNS response time to resolve the IP address, a database logging time, etc.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.3">3.</a> Purpose and Scope</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">The purpose of this document is to define a framework and a process for developing Performance Metrics for protocols above and below the IP-layer (such as IP-based applications that operate over reliable or datagram transport protocols), that can be used to characterize traffic on live networks and services. As such, this document does not define any Performance Metrics.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.2">The scope of this document covers guidelines for the Performance Metrics Directorate members for considering new Performance Metrics, and suggests how the Performance Metrics Directorate will interact with the rest of the IETF. However this document is not intended to supersede existing working methods within WGs that have existing chartered work in this area. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.3">This process is not intended to govern Performance Metric development in existing IETF WG that are focused on metrics development, such as IPPM and BMWG. However, this guidelines document may be useful in these activities, and MAY be applied where appropriate. A typical example is the development of Performance Metrics to be exported with the IPFIX protocol <a href="#RFC5101">RFC 5101</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC5101]</cite>, with specific IPFIX information elements <a href="#RFC5102">RFC 5102</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC5102]</cite>, which would benefit from the framework in this document. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.4">The framework in this document applies to Performance Metrics derived from both active and passive measurements.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.4">4.</a> Relationship between QoS, QoE and Application-specific Performance Metrics</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">Network QoS deals with network and network protocol performance, while QoE deals with the assessment of a user's experience in a context of a task or a service. As a result, the topic of application-specific Performance Metrics includes the measurement of performance at layers between IP and the user.  For example, network QoS metrics (packet loss, delay, and delay variation <a href="#RFC5481">[RFC5481]</a>) can be used to estimate application-specific Performance Metrics (de-jitter buffer size and RTP-layer packet loss), then combined with other known aspects of a VoIP application (such as codec type) to estimate a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) <a href="#P.800">[P.800]</a>.  However, the QoE for a particular VoIP user depends on the specific context, such as a casual conversation, a business conference call, or an emergency call.  Finally, QoS and application-specific Performance Metrics are quantitative, while QoE is qualitative. Also network QoS and application-specific Performance Metrics can be directly or indirectly evident to the user, while the QoE is directly evident.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5">
<a href="#rfc.section.5">5.</a> Performance Metrics Development</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.1">This section provides key definitions and qualifications of Performance Metrics.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.5.1">5.1.</a> Identifying and Categorizing the Audience</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.1">Many of the aspects of metric definition and reporting, even the selection or determination of the essential metrics, depend on who will use the results, and for what purpose. For example, the metric description SHOULD include use cases and example reports that illustrate service quality monitoring and maintenance or identification and quantification of problems.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.2">All documents defining Performance Metrics SHOULD identify the primary audience and its associated requirements. The audience can influence both the definition of metrics and the methods of measurement.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.3">The key areas of variation between different metric users include:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Suitability of passive measurements of live traffic, or active measurements using dedicated traffic</li>
<li>Measurement in laboratory environment, or on a network of deployed devices</li>
<li>Accuracy of the results</li>
<li>Access to measurement points and configuration information</li>
<li>Measurement topology (point-to-point, point-to-multipoint)</li>
<li>Scale of the measurement system</li>
<li>Measurements conducted on-demand, or continuously</li>
<li>Required reporting formats and periods</li>
<li>Sampling criteria, such systematic or probabilistic</li>
<li>Period (and duration) of measurement, as the live traffic can have patterns</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.5.2">5.2.</a> Definitions of a Performance Metric</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.1">A Performance Metric is a measure of an observable behavior of a networking technology, an application, or a service. Most of the time, the Performance Metric can be directly measured however, sometimes, the Performance Metric value is computed.  The process for determining the value of a metric may assume some implicit or explicit underlying statistical process, in this case, the Performance Metric is an estimate of a parameter of this process, assuming that the statistical process closely models the behavior of the system.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.2">A Performance Metric should serve some defined purpose. This may include the measurement of capacity, quantifying how bad some problem is, measurement of service level, problem diagnosis or location and other such uses. A Performance Metric may also be an input to some other process, for example the computation of a composite Performance Metric or a model or simulation of a system. Tests of the "usefulness" of a Performance Metric include:</p>
<p></p>

<ul class="empty">
<li>(i) the degree to which its absence would cause significant loss of information on the behavior or performance of the application or system being measured</li>
<li>(ii) the correlation between the Performance Metric, the QoS <a href="#G.1000">[G.1000]</a> and QoE delivered to the user (person or other application)</li>
<li>(iii) the degree to which the Performance Metric is able to support the identification and location of problems affecting service quality.</li>
<li>(iv) the requirement to develop policies (Service Level Agreement, and potentially Service Level Contract) based on the Performance Metric.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, consider a distributed application operating over a network connection that is subject to packet loss. A Packet Loss Rate (PLR) Performance Metric is defined as the mean packet loss ratio over some time period. If the application performs poorly over network connections with high packet loss ratio and always performs well when the packet loss ratio is zero then the PLR Performance Metric is useful to some degree. Some applications are sensitive to short periods of high loss (bursty loss) and are relatively insensitive to isolated packet loss events; for this type of application there would be very weak correlation between PLR and application performance. A "better" Performance Metric would consider both the packet loss ratio and the distribution of loss events. If application performance is degraded when the PLR exceeds some rate then a useful Performance Metric may be a measure of the duration and frequency of periods during which the PLR exceeds that rate (as for example in RFC3611).</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.5.3">5.3.</a> Computed Performance Metrics</h1>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.3.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.5.3.1">5.3.1.</a> Composed Performance Metrics</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.1.p.1">Some Performance Metrics may not be measured directly, but can be composed from base metrics that have been measured. A composed Performance Metric is derived from other metrics by applying a deterministic process or function (e.g., a composition function). The process may use metrics that are identical to the metric being composed, or metrics that are dissimilar, or some combination of both types. Usually the base metrics have a limited scope in time or space, and they can be combined to estimate the performance of some larger entities.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.1.p.2">Some examples of composed Performance Metrics and composed Performance Metric definitions are:</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.1.p.3">In the context of flow records in IP Flow Information eXport (IPFIX), the IPFIX Mediation: Framework <a href="#RFC6183">[RFC6183]</a> also discusses some aspects of the temporal and spatial composition. </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.3.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.5.3.2">5.3.2.</a> Index</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.2.p.1">An Index is a metric for which the output value range has been selected for convenience or clarity, and the behavior of which is selected to support ease of understanding; for example the R Factor <a href="#G.107">[G.107]</a>. The deterministic function for an index is often developed after the index range and behavior have been determined.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.5.4">5.4.</a> Performance Metric Specification</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.1">The informative part of a Performance Metric specification is intended to support the implementation and use of the metric. This part SHOULD provide the following data:</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.2">(i) Implementation </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.3">The implementation description MAY be in the form of text, algorithm or example software. The objective of this part of the metric definition is to assist implementers to achieve consistent results.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.4">(ii) Verification</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.5">The Performance Metric definition SHOULD provide guidance on verification testing. This may be in the form of test vectors, a formal verification test method or informal advice.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.6">(iii) Use and Applications</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.7">The use and applications description is intended to assist the "user" to understand how, when and where the metric can be applied, and what significance the value range for the metric may have. This MAY include a definition of the "typical" and "abnormal" range of the Performance Metric, if this was not apparent from the nature of the metric.  The description MAY include information about the influence of extreme measurement values, i.e. if the Performance Metric is sensitive to outliers. The Use and Application section SHOULD also include the security implications in the description.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.8">For example: </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.9">(a) it is fairly intuitive that a lower packet loss ratio would equate to better performance. However the user may not know the significance of some given packet loss ratio,</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.10">(b) the speech level of a telephone signal is commonly expressed in dBm0. If the user is presented with:</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.11">Speech level = -7 dBm0 </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.12">this is not intuitively understandable, unless the user is a telephony expert. If the metric definition explains that the typical range is -18 to -28 dBm0, a value higher than -18 means the signal may be too high (loud) and less than -28 means that the signal may be too low (quiet), it is much easier to interpret the metric. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.13">(iv) Reporting Model</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.14">The reporting model definition is intended to make any relationship between the metric and the reporting model clear. There are often implied relationships between the method of reporting metrics and the metric itself, however these are often not made apparent to the implementor. For example, if the metric is a short term running average packet delay variation (e.g. the interarrival jitter in <a href="#RFC3550">[RFC3550]</a>) and this value is reported at intervals of 6-10 seconds, the resulting measurement may have limited accuracy when packet delay variation is non-stationary.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.15">Normative</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.16">Informative</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.4.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.5.4.1">5.4.1.</a> Outline</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.1.p.1">A Performance Metric definition MUST have a normative part that defines what the metric is and how it is measured or computed and SHOULD have an informative part that describes the Performance Metric and its application. </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.4.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.5.4.2">5.4.2.</a> Normative parts of Performance Metric definition</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.2.p.1">The normative part of a Performance Metric definition MUST define at least the following: </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.2.p.2">(i) Metric Name</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.2.p.3">Performance Metric names are RECOMMENDED to be unique within the set of metrics being defined for the protocol layer and context. While strict uniqueness may not be attainable (See the IPPM registry <a href="#RFC6248">[RFC6248]</a> for an example of IANA metric registry failing to provide sufficient specificity), broad review must be sought to avoid naming overlap.  Note that the Performance Metrics Directorate can help with suggestions for IANA metric registration for unique naming. The Performance Metric name MAY be descriptive.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.2.p.4">(ii) Metric Description</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.2.p.5">The Performance Metric description MUST explain what the metric is, what is being measured and how this relates to the performance of the system being measured.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.2.p.6">(iii) Method of Measurement or Calculation</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.2.p.7">The method of measurement or calculation MUST define what is being measured or computed and the specific algorithm to be used. Does the measurement involve active or only passive measurements? Terms such as "average" should be qualified (e.g. running average or average over some interval). Exception cases SHOULD also be defined with the appropriate handling method. For example, there are a number of commonly used metrics related to packet loss; these often don't define the criteria by which a packet is determined to be lost (vs very delayed) or how duplicate packets are handled. For example, if the average packet loss rate during a time interval is reported, and a packet's arrival is delayed from one interval to the next then was it "lost" during the interval during which it should have arrived or should it be counted as received?</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.2.p.8">Some methods of calculation might require discarding some data collected (due to outliers) so as to make the measurement parameters meaningful. One example is burstable billing that sorts the 5-min samples, and discard the top 5 percentile.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.2.p.9">Some parameters linked to the method MAY also be reported, in order to fully interpret the Performance Metric. For example, the time interval, the load, the minimum packet loss, the potential measurement errors and their sources, the attainable accuracy of the metric (e.g. +/-0,1), the method of caluclation, etc...</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.2.p.10">(iv) Units of measurement </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.2.p.11">The units of measurement MUST be clearly stated.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.2.p.12">(v) Measurement Point(s)</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.2.p.13">If the measurement is specific to a measurement point, this SHOULD be defined. The measurement domain MAY also be defined. Specifically, if measurement points are spread across domains, the measurement domain (intra-, inter-) is another factor to consider.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.2.p.14">The Performance Metric definition should discuss how the Performance Metric value might vary depending which measurement point is chosen. For example, the time between a SIP request <a href="#RFC3261">[RFC3261]</a> and the final response can be significantly different at the User Agent Client (UAC) or User Agent Server (UAS).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.2.p.15">In some cases, the measurement requires multiple measurement points: all measurement points SHOULD be defined, including the measurement domain(s).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.2.p.16">(vi) Measurement timing</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.2.p.17">The acceptable range of timing intervals or sampling intervals for a measurement and the timing accuracy required for such intervals MUST be specified. Short sampling intervals or frequent samples provide a rich source of information that can help to assess application performance but may lead to excessive measurement data. Long measurement or sampling intervals reduce the amount of reported and collected data such that it may be insufficient to understand application performance or service quality insofar as the measured quantity may vary significantly with time.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.2.p.18">In case of multiple measurement points, the potential requirement for synchronized clocks must be clearly specified. In the specific example of the IP delay variation application metric, the different aspects of synchronized clocks are discussed in  <a href="#RFC5481">[RFC5481]</a>.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.5.4.4">5.4.4.</a> Performance Metric Definition Template</h1>
<p></p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.4.5">
<a href="#rfc.section.5.4.5">5.4.5.</a> Example: Loss Rate</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.5.p.1">The example used is the loss rate metric as specified in <a href="#RFC3611">RFC 3611</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC3611]</cite>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.5.p.2">Metric Name: LossRate</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.5.p.3">Metric Description: The fraction of RTP data packets from the source lost since the beginning of reception.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.5.p.4">Method of measurement or calculation: This value is calculated by dividing the total number of packets lost (after the effects of applying any error protection such as FEC) by the total number of packets expected, multiplying the result of the division by 256, limiting the maximum value to 255 (to avoid overflow), and taking the integer part.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.5.p.5">Units of Measurement: This metric is expressed as a fixed point number with the binary point at the left edge of the field. For example, a metric value of 12 means a loss rate of approximately 5%.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.5.p.6">Measurement Point(s): This metric is made at the receiving end of the RTP stream sent during a Voice over IP call.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.5.p.7">Measurement Timing: This metric can be used over a wide range of time intervals. Using time intervals of longer than one hour may prevent the detection of variations in the value of this metric due to time- of-day changes in network load. Timing intervals should not vary in duration by more than +/- 2%.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.5.p.8">Implementation: The numbers of duplicated packets and discarded packets do not enter into this calculation.  Since receivers cannot be required to maintain unlimited buffers, a receiver MAY categorize late-arriving packets as lost.  The degree of lateness that triggers a loss SHOULD be significantly greater than that which triggers a discard.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.5.p.9">Verification: The metric value ranges between 0 and 255.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.5.p.10">Use and Applications: This metric is useful for monitoring VoIP calls. More precisely, to detect the VoIP loss rate in the network. This loss rate, along with the rate of packets discarded due to jitter, has some effect on the quality of the voice stream.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.5.p.11">Reporting Model: This metric needs to be associated with a defined time interval, which could be defined by fixed intervals or by a sliding window. In the context of RFC3611 the metric is measured continuously from the start of the RTP stream, the value of the metric is sampled and reported in RTCP XR VoIP Metrics reports</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.5">
<a href="#rfc.section.5.5">5.5.</a> Dependencies</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.p.1">This section introduces several Performance Metrics dependencies, which the Performance Metric designer should keep in mind during the Performance Metric development. These dependencies, and any others not listed here, SHOULD be documented in the Performance Metric specifications.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.5.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.5.5.1">5.5.1.</a> Timing accuracy</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.1.p.1">The accuracy of the timing of a measurement may affect the accuracy of the Performance Metric. This may not materially affect a sampled value metric however would affect an interval based metric. Some metrics, for example the number of events per time interval, would be directly affected; for example a 10% variation in time interval would lead directly to a 10% variation in the measured value. Other metrics, such as the average packet loss ratio during some time interval, would be affected to a lesser extent.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.1.p.2">If it is necessary to correlate sampled values or intervals then it is essential that the accuracy of sampling time and interval start/ stop times is sufficient for the application (for example +/- 2%).  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.5.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.5.5.2">5.5.2.</a> Dependencies of Performance Metric definitions on related events or metrics</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.2.p.1">Performance Metric definitions may explicitly or implicitly rely on factors that may not be obvious. For example, the recognition of a packet as being "lost" relies on having some method to know the packet was actually lost (e.g. RTP sequence number), and some time threshold after which a non-received packet is declared as lost. It is important that any such dependencies are recognized and incorporated into the metric definition.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.5.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.5.5.3">5.5.3.</a> Relationship between Performance Metric and lower layer         Performance Metrics</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.3.p.1">Lower layer Performance Metrics may be used to compute or infer the performance of higher layer applications, potentially using an application performance model. The accuracy of this will depend on many factors including: </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.3.p.2">(i) The completeness of the set of metrics - i.e. are there metrics for all the input values to the application performance model? </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.3.p.3">(ii) Correlation between input variables (being measured) and application performance </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.3.p.4">(iii) Variability in the measured metrics and how this variability affects application performance </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.5.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.5.5.4">5.5.4.</a> Middlebox presence</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.4.p.1">Presence of a middlebox <a href="#RFC3303">[RFC3303]</a>, e.g., proxy, network address translation (NAT), redirect server, session border controller (SBC, <a href="#RFC5853">[RFC5853]</a>), and application layer gateway (ALG) may add variability to or restrict the scope of measurements of a metric. For example, an SBC that does not process RTP loopback packets may block or locally terminate this traffic rather then pass it through to its target.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.6">
<a href="#rfc.section.5.6">5.6.</a> Organization of Results</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.6.p.1">The IPPM Framework [RFC2330] organizes the results of metrics into three related notions:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>singleton, an elementary instance, or "atomic" value.</li>
<li>sample, a set of singletons with some common properties and some varying properties.</li>
<li>statistic, a value derived from a sample through deterministic calculation, such as the mean.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.5.6.p.3">Performance Metrics MAY use this organization for the results, with or without the term names used by IPPM WG. Section 11 of <a href="#RFC2330">RFC 2330</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC2330]</cite> should consulted for further details.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.7">
<a href="#rfc.section.5.7">5.7.</a> Parameters, the variables of a Performance Metric</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.7.p.1">Metrics are completely defined when all options and input variables have been identified and considered. These variables are sometimes left unspecified in a metric definition, and their general name indicates that the user must set them and report them with the results. Such variables are called "parameters" in the IPPM metric template. The scope of the metric, the time at which it was conducted, the length interval of the sliding window measurement, the settings for timers and the thresholds for counters are all examples of parameters.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.2">Proposals SHOULD be prepared as Internet Drafts, describing the Performance Metric and conforming to the qualifications above as much as possible. Proposals SHOULD be deliverables of the corresponding protocol development WG charters. As such, the Proposals SHOULD be vetted by that WG prior to discussion by the Performance Metrics Directorate. This aspect of the process includes an assessment of the need for the Performance Metric proposed and assessment of the support for their development in IETF.  </p>

<h1 id="rfc.section.6.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.6.3">6.3.</a> Performance Metrics Directorate Interaction with other WGs</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.1">The Performance Metrics Directorate SHALL provide guidance to the related protocol development WG when considering an Internet Draft that specifies Performance Metrics for a protocol. A sufficient number of individuals with expertise must be willing to consult on the draft. If the related WG has concluded, comments on the proposal should still be sought from key RFC authors and former chairs.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.2">A formal review is recommended by the time the document is reviewed by the Area Directors, or an IETF Last Call is being conducted - same as expert reviews are being performed by other directorates.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.3">Existing mailing lists SHOULD be used, however a dedicated mailing list MAY be initiated if necessary to facilitate work on a draft.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.4">In some cases, it will be appropriate to have the IETF session discussion during the related protocol WG session, to maximize visibility of the effort to that WG and expand the review.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.6.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.6.4">6.4.</a> Standards Track Performance Metrics</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.4.p.1">The Performance Metrics Directorate will assist with the progression of RFCs along the Standards Track. See <a href="#I-D.bradner-metricstest">[I-D.bradner-metricstest]</a>.  This may include the preparation of test plans to examine different implementations of the metrics to ensure that the metric definitions are clear and unambiguous (depending on the final form of the draft above).  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.7.p.1">This document makes no request of IANA.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.8">8.</a> <a href="#Security" id="Security">Security Considerations</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.1">In general, the existence of a framework for Performance Metric development does not constitute a security issue for the Internet.  Performance Metric definitions may introduce security issues and this framework recommends that those defining Performance Metrics should identify any such risk factors.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.2">The security considerations that apply to any active measurement of live networks are relevant here. See <a href="#RFC4656">[RFC4656]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.3">The security considerations that apply to any passive measurement of specific packets in live networks are relevant here as well. See the security considerations in <a href="#RFC5475">[RFC5475]</a>.</p>
