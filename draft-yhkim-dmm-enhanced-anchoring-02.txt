1.  Introduction

   This document aims to identify what should be enhanced for mobility
   anchoring and to provide possible approaches for the enhanced
   mobility anchoring over the three functional deployment models
   presented in [draft-sijeon-dmm-deployment-models].

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document focuses on enhanced mobility anchoring based on the
   functional deployment models presented in [draft-sijeon-dmm-
   deployment-models], which describes deployment models with mobility
   management functions in [RFC7429].  Therefore, the definitions of
   location management (LM) and forwarding management (FM) for mobility
   management are followed as they are.  Internetwork Location
   Management (LM) is a control-plane function, which manages and keeps
   track of the internetwork location of an MN.  The location
   information may be a binding of the advertised IP address/prefix,
   e.g., HoA or HNP, to the IP routing address of the MN, or it may be a
   binding of a node that can forward packets destined to the MN.
   Forwarding Management (FM) function performs packet interception and
   forwarding to/from the IP address/prefix assigned to the MN, based on
   the internetwork location information, either to the destination or
   to some other network element that knows how to forward the packets
   to their destination.  Following the FM definition in [RFC7429], it
   may be split into the control plane (FM-CP) and data plane (FM-DP).
   However, definition of Anchoring function is modified, following the

   definition in [draft-sijeon-dmm-deployment-models].  Anchoring
   Function (AF) is defined as a combined control-plane and data-plane
   functions.  For the control-plane function, it allocates an IP
   address, i.e., Home Address (HoA), or prefix, i.e., Home Network
   Prefix (HNP) a mobile node, topologically anchored by the advertising
   node.  That is, the anchor node is able to advertise a connected
   route into the routing infrastructure for the allocated IP prefixes.
   It also takes a data-plane anchor point where packets destined to the
   IP address or IP prefix allocated by the anchor should pass through.
   It can be deployed in a decoupled way, i.e.  separated control plane
   and data plane.  In that case, following two terms - AF-CP and AF-DP
   - are used.  AF-CP is responsible of allocating the IP address and
   advertising a connected route for an associated terminal while AF-DP
   is responsible of anchoring received data packets destined to the IP
   address allocated by the anchor.

3.  Enhanced Mobility Anchoring

   Based on the presented functional deployment models for DMM, we
   describe what anchoring models are available and which aspects of
   mobility anchoring can be enhanced.

   Figure 1.  Distributed AM, LM, and FM functions (with centralized LM)

   Fig. 1 shows AF is distributed with LM and FM at edge mobility
   routers.  The AF allocates an IP address or IP prefix and advertises
   a connected route of the mobile terminal configured with the
   allocated IP address or IP prefix, when the terminal is attached at a

   mobility router.  It takes a role of intercepting packets destined to
   the allocated IP address/prefix of the mobile terminal.

   Figure 2.  Distributed AF-DP, LM and FM functions with centralized
   AF-CP (+ LM)

   The deployment model in Fig. 2 shows that AF-DP is distributed with
   LM and FM into deployed mobility routers while AF-CP is centralized
   in a single entity.  Allocating an IP address/prefix is provided by
   AF-CP, while packet interception is supported by AF-DP.  As the
   control plane and data plane of AF is separated, flexible AF-DP
   selection can be enabled for load balancing or network management, as
   an enhanced mobility anchoring aspect.  Based on the separated AF-CP
   and AF-DP architecture, switching of AF-DP can be supported under the
   control of AF-CP.

   Figure 3.  Distributed AF-DP and FM-DP with centralized AF-CP, LM,
   and FM-CP

   In the function deployment model shown in Fig. 3, separation of FM-CP
   and FM-DP is implemented with the separation of AF-CP and AF-DP.  The
   LM is located at the central entity.  Comparing deployment models
   described in Fig. 3 and Fig. 2, this deployment model facilitates
   management and optimization of forwarding path, even in the mid-
   session, between the AF-DP of an allocated IP address and a current
   serving router where the terminal is attached.  Moreover, it enables
   supporting a flexible selection of forwarding data path well as
   supporting a flexible AF-DP selection by AF-CP.
