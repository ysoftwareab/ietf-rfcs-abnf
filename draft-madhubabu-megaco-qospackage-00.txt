 1. Abstract

    This document is work in progress and defines the basic QoS 
    Package that addresses the different means of supporting Quality 
    of service (QoS)  on IP networks. This memo also defines the 
    RSVP package (that falls into the Integrated services model) and 
    the Differentiated services package in association with the 
    Megaco/H.248 Protocol that can be used to control a Media 
    Gateway (MG) from an external controller, called a Media Gateway 
    controller (MGC). It is intended to satisfy the requirements in 
    section 12 of the Megaco/H.248 requirement document [2].

    The rest of this draft is organized into the following major 
    sections:

    * Introduction
    * Assumptions
    * Description of the Basic QoS package
    * Description of the RSVP package
    * Description of the DiffServ package
    * References
    * Author's Addresses

 4. Introduction

    The IP network was not originally designed for supporting 
    non-elastic real-time applications. Efforts were later made to 
    overcome the problem faced by such applications. The two possible
    solutions identified are 1) to provide more network resource to 
    support all types of applications and/or 2) with the existing 
    network, design a control mechanism for traffic engineering for 
    all the applications. As part of its standardization effort IETF 
    has defined Integrated services and Differentiated services for 
    addressing the traffic Engineering.

    The Integrated services defines an architecture for supporting 
    real-time as well as the current non-real-time service of IP. The 
    Differentiated services architecture achieves scalability by 
    aggregating traffic classification state which is conveyed by 
    means of IP-layer packet marking using the DS field. This memo is 
    an effort to define a set of new Megaco packages for Integrated 
    and Differentiated services. This ensures QoS for voice/multimedia 
    applications when Megaco is used.
    
    This memo first defines a basic QoS Package that identifies the 
    the actual QoS mechanism that needs to be used by the MG. The RSVP 
    package is defined to include events, signals and properties that
    are exchanged between the MG and the MGC while supporting the 
    Integrated services architecture. The DiffServ Package defines the 
    events, signals and properties that enables MG and MGC to 
    communicate the necessary information for the usage of 
    Differentiated services. 
   
    The RSVP package is defined to address both the Guaranteed 
    service and  Controlled-Load Service models. The ADSPEC object is 
    required only for the intermediate nodes and hence this information
    is not exchanged between MG and MGC. Two set of properties namely 
    the sending and receiving stream properties are defined as the 
    traffic characteristics of sending and receiving streams may be 
    different.

    The DiffServ package enables the MGC to use either the Expedited 
    Forwarding or Assured Forwarding. The mechanism of indicating the 
    Differentiated services code point will take care of the actual 
    forwarding method to be used. The choosing of either of the method
     is transparent to the MG. 

    In Megaco perspective the QoS of service can be any optional 
    functionality supported by the Media gateways. If any of the 
    specified QoS methods are used, it is supported on per stream 
    basis. The events, signals, properties defined in this draft are 
    specific to each stream. The specific QoS mechanism will be 
    disabled either by deletion of the stream or when the termination 
    is subtracted from context. The QoS mechanism can be disabled 
    any time by the MGC. 

    The RSVP resource profiles will be are not directly deduced from 
    the stream descriptor. Thus enabling the MGC to completely specify 
    the Traffic Characteristics.
     

 5. Assumptions.
    This section lists the basic assumptions of the present document.

    General:


     * The document tries to capture both the Integrated and 
       Differentiated services defined by the IETF. Latest works like 
       the M-RSVP and CR-LDP for MPLS are not addressed in this draft. 
       Additional packages (if required) can be later defined to meet 
       these requirements.
     * If the MGC switches QoS to "off", the MG has to generate the 
       necessary QoS teardown messages by itself.
       

    Integrated Services:


     * If only one MG has the RSVP reservation capability and other 
       doesn't, then no reservation is done.
     * The MG that receives a Path messages has to interpret the 
       ADSPEC, SENDER_TSPEC and the MGC conveyed information for 
       generating the FLOWSPEC. How the MG will make this decision, 
       is out-of-scope of the present draft. 
     * The RSVP package information only aids the decision making of 
       the RESV message generating MG. It is up to the MG to make the 
       decision based on these properties and the parameters received 
       from the SENDER_TSPEC and ADSPEC objects of the Path Message.
     * In case of intermediate non-RSVP nodes, the reservation of 
       resources takes the best effort possibility at that node in 
       the chain of nodes between the sender and the receiver.

     * Generation of RSVP Objects is out of scope of the draft.
     * This memo doesn't distinguish the usage of either Raw IP packets
       or UDP encapsulation for RSVP messages.
     * If the RSVP session establishment fails, the MG will indicate 
       the same to the MGC with the defined events. If the MGC wants 
       the MG to discontinue without RSVP, then MGC may delete the 
       stream. The default behavior at the MG is that even in case of 
       RSVP failures, it continues generating and receiving the media 
       packets.

       

   Differentiated Services:

     * The Differentiated Services defines specific pre-defined 
       values to be set Type-of service field in the IP header.  The 
       MGC can specify any value for this field thus enabling the 
       MG to use whatever is specified by the MGC. This may be 
       Diffserv defined value, or can be TOS value (as defined 
       in RFC 1349).

   Code              Text                Explanation

   1XX         RSVP session           This error code is used when
             not established yet      MGC specifies the "rsvptdown" 
                                      signal, when there is no RSVP
                                      established.
     
 7.7 Procedures.
     
     The RSVP reservation is performed for Media streams, only when 
     both MGs can support RSVP. This document assumes that the 
     application generated Path and Resv messages are initiated 
     by the MG under the control of MGC.  For bi-directional 
     reservation both MGs had to generate Path and Resv messages. 
     The generation of RSVP messages from the MG is performed only 
     when both Local and remote descriptors are fully known to both 
     the MGs. 

     If the MGC provides the properties defined in this package 
     before the local and remote descriptor are fully known, the 
     MG will initiate the RSVP messages as soon as it is aware of 
     the fully specified local and remote descriptors. It is the 
     responsibility of the MG to generate periodic Path and Resv 
     messages. The properties srsvpsmod, sfilsty, stbrate, stbdepth, 
     smpu , spdrate and smpsize when used for the Sending MG 
     will be used in the Path messages, whereas the rrsvpsmod, 
     rfilsty, rtbrate, rtbdepth, rmpu , rpdrate and rmpsize 
     properties when used for receiving MG will aid the reservation 
     decision-making at the MG thus will be present in the Resv 
     messages. 
   

     The sending stream properties are sent from the MGC to MG when 
     the MG has to generate a Path message. The Receiving stream 
     properties are sent to the MG when the MG has to receive media.
     Thus the receiving stream properties are used by the MG to make 
     the decision for selecting the values in the FLOWSPEC. The 
     rsvptdown signal is only a means by which the MGC can indicate

     MG to teardown an existing RSVP session. 

     If a RSVP session is not present and the MGC uses this signal 
     in the signals descriptor, the error code 1XX will be used. 

     If a MG doesn't receive any Receiving properties from the MGC 
     but received a Path. The RSVP Teardown message will be generated 
     by the MG when Subtract is received for the termination OR a 
     stream is deleted due to any other reason as defined in the 
     protocol (stream deletion definition is given in the protocol)
 
 8.0 DIFF SERV PACKAGE
 8.1 Package

    Package Name: Diff Serv Package
    Package ID: diffserv (To be allocated through IANA)
    Description: This package provides basic event and signal 
                 handling for terminations for using the 
                 Differentiated services between the two Media 
                 Gateways. 
    Version: 1
    Extends: Basic QoS Package.

 8.2 Properties

   Possible values:
      0 to 255

      Default is 0.

   Defined in: Local Control Descriptor.

   Characteristics:    read/write

 8.5 Statistics 

     None

 8.6 Error code
          
     None
     
 8.7 Procedures.
     
     The "dscp" property value will be used at the MG to set the same 
     value in the TOS byte of the Media packets it generates. The MG 
     will not worry about the TOS byte set in the packets it receives.
     If the MGC specifies any "dscp" values which actually doesn't 
     match with the Diff serv defined code points, the MG will still 
     set what ever value is set by the MGC for the given parameter.
     This enables the MGC to use any predefined values or Experimental 
     values for the TOS byte in the IP Header. 


 9. Security Considerations

    For RSVP the security considerations for the intermediate 
    routers are assumed to be taken care as described in RFC 2207. 
    This is necessary as the IP-level security, under either IPv4 
    or IPv6 may encrypt the entire transport header, hiding the port 
    numbers of data packets from intermediate routers.
    
    For Differentiated Services the security considerations are 
    assumed to be taken care as described in Section 6 of RFC 2475.
