Introduction

   This document reflects work being done by the trunk-mib working
   group (trunk-mib@cisco.com).  This document defines a MIB which allows
   DDS-type interfaces to be managed via SNMP.  This is an attempt
   to ensure that SNMP compliant DDS devices have a common MIB.
   An attempt has been made to include devices which support DDS
   secondary channel capability.  This document is intended to allow
   for the SNMP managment of the basic DDS CSU/DSU, with and without
   rate adaption.

1.  The Network Management Framework

   The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
   components.  They are:

      STD 16/RFC 1155 [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
      describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.  STD
      16/RFC 1212 [2] defines a more concise description mechanism,
      which is wholly consistent with the SMI.

      RFC 1156 [3] which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects
      for the Internet suite of protocols.  STD 17/RFC 1213 [4] defines
      MIB-II, an evolution of MIB-I based on implementation experience
      and new operational requirements.

      STD 15/RFC 1157 [5] which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for
      network access to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

2.  Objects

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [6]
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object has a name, a syntax,
   and an encoding.  The name is an object identifier, an
   administratively assigned name, which specifies an object type.  The
   object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT
   DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.

   The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure
   corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1 language is used for
   this purpose.  However, the SMI [1] purposely restricts the ASN.1
   constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are explicitly made
   for simplicity.

   The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type is
   represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly tied to the
   notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the object type
   is represented when being transmitted on the network.

   The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [7],
   subject to the additional requirements imposed by the SNMP.

2.1.  Format of Definitions

   Section 4 contains contains the specification of all object types
   contained in this MIB module.  The object types are defined using the
   conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions
   specified in STD 16, RFC 1212 [2].

3.  Overview

   This document applies to DDS-type devices which are SNMP managable.  The
   MIB contained herein describes objects for the management of config-
   uration, diagnostics, alarms, and statistics related to DDS CSU/DSUs.
   The definitions contained herein are based on the AT&T Digital Data-
   phone Service (DDS) Specification [8].

   The following diagram demonstrates how an SNMP managable DSU/CSU
   shelf could be connected to a router to allow the router WANs
   access to the DDS circuits.

3.1.  Binding between ifIndex and DDS Interfaces

   The ifIndex is used throughout to identify the DDS interfaces
   if more than one is available on the equipment in use.

3.2.  Objectives of this MIB Module

   As stated above, this MIB was designed soley for the management of
   devices with DDS network interfaces.  This would include, but is
   not limited to DDS DSU/CSUs, routers with DDS network interfaces,
   and the like.  Since the devices currently deployed use enterprise
   MIBs for this type of management, this MIB is proposed to allow
   for a standardized management methodology.

3.3.  DDS Terminology

   The terms used in this document, that describe the line conditions
   of a DDS interface, come from AT&T's technical reference document
   TR62310 - DS0 Digital Local Channel Description and Interface
   Specification.

3.3.1 Performance and Availability

   The performance terms used are Errored Seconds (ES), Error-Free
   Seconds (EFS), and Severely Errored Seconds (SES).  An Errored
   Second is any second during which at least one bit was in error.
   An Error-Free Second is a second during which there were no bits
   in error.  A Severely Errored Second is a second during which the
   error threshold of 1x10^-3 was exceeded.

3.3.2 Network Alarms and Status Conditions

   When a failure occurs in the network, a control code will be
   forwarded through the network to the DCE at the customer interface.

3.3.3 Network Control Codes

   Table 5.3 on page 13 of AT&T TR 62310 specifies the Network Control

   codes in detail.  A further discussion of the nature of the codes
   is not warranted here.

3.3.4 Loopbacks and Their Methods

   The two loopbacks defined by TR 62310 are CSU loopback and DSU 
   loopback.  The CSU loopback is intended to loop the network
   connection back to itself as close as is possible to the network
   interface (NI).  The DSU loopback is usually implemented as a
   bidirectional loop located a close as possible to the DTE side
   of the CSU/DSU.

   These loopbacks may be activated by either a non-latching method
   or latching method.

3.3.4.1 Non-Latching Loopbacks

   The non-latching loopback is activated when the network sends a
   loop-code byte alternated with a test pattern byte.  The loop
   must start after the detection of four consecutive bytes of the
   loop code (CSU or DSU) and remain engaged until five consecutive
   bytes are received without the loop code.  The loop codes must be
   replaced with a return-code when looped back toward the network.
   This is used to synchronize the test pattern detector.

3.3.4.2 Latching Loopbacks

   Latching loops are named such because a pattern is sent from the
   network to the CSU/DSU to cause a loopback condition which will
   remain in effect once the patttern has ceased.  On page 17 of
   TR 62310, the sequence for activating the latching loopbacks are
   described in detail.

   Another approach that is often used is to follow the V.54 modem
   loopback specification (CCITT Recommendation V.54 [11]).
