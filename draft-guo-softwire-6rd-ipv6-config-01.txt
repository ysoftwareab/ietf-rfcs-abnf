Internet-Draft       IPv6 Host Configuration in 6rd         August 2010 
 
Abstract 

   This document proposes a new DHCPv4 option containing the addresses 
   of DHCPv6 servers through which the 6rd CPE could obtain the IPv6 
   addresses of DHCPv6 servers. Thus, the 6rd CPE as a DHCP relay agent 
   could relay DHCP messages from IPv6 hosts which is located in 6rd 
   home networks to one of the known DHCPv6 servers.

Internet-Draft       IPv6 Host Configuration in 6rd         August 2010 
 
    
1. Introduction 

   IPv6 rapid deployment on IPv4 infrastructures (6rd) [RFC5969] 
   enables a service provider to rapidly deploy IPv6 unicast service to 
   customer sites via its IPv4 network.  

   Besides IPv6 addresses, IPv6-only hosts in residential sites may 
   also need to obtain other configuration information (e.g., DNS 
   servers, NTP servers or SIP servers etc.). DNS Proxy [RFC5625]is a 
   mature mechanism but only for DNS configuration. However, stateless 
   DHCPv6 [RFC3736] is a standard approach for obtaining other 
   configuration information besides DNS.  

   As stated in the DHCPv6 specification [RFC3315], "...The client MUST 
   use a link-local address assigned to the interface for which it is 
   requesting configuration information as the source address in the 
   header of the IP datagram." Since the link-local address can not 
   travel through the 6rd domain, the CPE SHOULD act as a DHCPv6 relay 
   agent. However, relaying DHCP request messages destined for 
   All_DHCP_Relay_Agent_and_Servers multicast address is not optimal in 
   6rd scenario since the only available way of forwarding this 
   multicast message in 6rd is to tunnel it to a BR. If a 6rd SP 
   deployed multiple BRs for load-balancing purpose, each BR SHOULD be 
   configured either as a DHCP server or as a DHCP relay agent. In 
   addition, in case that the DHCP server/relay on a given BR is 
   unavailable due to some reason but the other functions on it (e.g., 
   the route towards its anycast address) are still available, once the 
   DHCP message is tunneled to that BR, the DHCP service is not 
   available any more. Since the DHCP information-request can not be 
   relayed to other DHCP servers/relays, it's impossible to achieve 
   high availability for DHCP servers/relay agents. 

   As an alternative, if the CPE as a DHCP relay agent has already 
   known at least one DHCPv6 server address, the CPE could send the 
   DHCP relay-forward message to one of the learnt DHCP server in 
   unicast. Since 6rd can support unicast in a much flexible way, the 
   DHCP server can be located either on/behind any BR or behind a 6rd 
   CPE which is owned by the 6rd SP.  

   Since 6rd CPEs derive the 6rd prefix from a new DHCPv4 option 
   according to [RFC5969], the DHCPv6 server addresses can be learnt in 
   a much similar way (i.e., via a new DHCPv4 option). Details about 
   this new DHCPv4 option and the related procedure of running DHCPv6 
   in 6rd are described in Section 2 and 3, respectively.

3. DHCPv6 Deployment in 6rd 

   The DHCPv6 server is deployed in an IPv6 network, DHCPv6 messages 
   MUST pass through IPv4 network with 6rd encapsulation. IPv6 hosts 
   behind the 6rd CPE SHOULD follow procedure depicted in Figure 2 when 
   they use DHCPv6 to obtain configuration information: 

        (1) The 6rd CPE acting as a DHCPv6 relay agent obtains the 
            addresses of the DHCPv6 servers according to the received 
            DHCPv6 Server Option from DHCPv4 server. Note that the CPE 
            SHOULD have a 6rd address in order to behave as a relay 
            agent.   

        (2) When receiving a DHCPv6 Information-request packet from an       
            IPv6 host, the 6rd CPE SHOULD relay the message according 
            to Relay Agent Behavior defined in [RFC3315].   

        (3) The DHCPv6 Relay-forward message travels through the 6rd 
            domain and is sent to a DHCPv6 server.
