Abstract 
 
   This document describes a URN (Uniform Resource Name) namespace for 
   identifying news-related data items. A news-related data item is an 
   information resource used for news exchange that is expressed as an 
   instance complying with a specific data schema. This may be the 
   schema of IPTC news standards specifications such as NewsML 1 and 
   the G2-Standards or the specification of any other body.

1. Introduction 
 
   NewsML 1 and the G2-Standards specify XML formats for packaging 
   multimedia news resources and items representing knowledge. These 
   standards have been created under the auspices of the International 
   Press Telecommunications Council (IPTC). Though the Namespace ID 
   specified by this RFC is "newsml", the URNs specified here are 
   intended for global use by any kind of news-related item. Their 
   intended use is not restricted to IPTC standards. 
 
   The same logical news-related data item may exist in multiple 
   physical locations. Specifications for such items - among them 
   NewsML 1 and the IPTC G2-Standards - allow for each item to have 
   multiple URLs to access and retrieve it, but only a single URN as an 
   identifier. It is the latter which uniquely identifies the resource.  
    
   This document obsoletes RFC 3085. The reasons for updating RFC 3085 
   are: 
    
   RFC 3085, issued in March 2001, specified the URN to be used when 
   identifying individual NewsML 1 NewsItems only. Since that time the 
   IPTC and other organisations have defined other news item formats 
   than NewsML 1 which also require identification and do so in a 
   slightly different way. This new RFC addresses this issue by 
   updating the original definition. This includes meeting the formal 
   requirements of the new RFC template for URN registrations issued by 
   the IETF (RFC 3406). 
 
   This namespace specification is for a formal namespace.

   Declaration of syntactic structure: 
 
      The identifier has the following ABNF[6] specification: 
 
      This is the form used for identifying a unique resource 
      in a NewsML instance. 
 
      NSS = ProviderId ":" DateId ":" NewsItemId 
             [":" RevisionId][Update] 
      ProviderId = string 
      DateId = date 
      NewsItemId = string 
      RevisionId = posint 
      Update = 0*1( "A" / "U" ) 
      date = century year month day 
      century = ( "0" posdig ) / ( posdig DIGIT ) 
      year = 2DIGIT 
      month = ( 0 posdig ) / ( "1" ( "0" "1" "2" ) ) 
      day = ( 0 posdig ) / ( ( "1" / "2" ) DIGIT ) / "30" / "31" 
      string = 1*char 
      char = ALPHA / DIGIT / symbol / escape 
      symbol = "(" / ")" / "+" / "," / "-" / "." / "=" / "@" / ";" / 
        "$" / "_" / "!" / "*" / "'" 
      escape = "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG 
      posint = posdig *DIGIT 
      posdig = "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7" / "8" / "9" 
 
      ProviderId must be a registered Internet domain name or a 
        subdomain name of such a domain, and must be registered, at the 
        date given in DateId, by the organisation creating the news 
        resource and allocating the URN to it. 
       
      DateId is a date in ISO 8601 Basic Format (CCYYMMDD), and must 
         correspond to a date at which the organisation allocating the 
         URN was the registered owner of the domain name specified in 
         the ProviderId. 
 
      NewsItemId must be unique among all news-related data items 
         emanating from the organisation with the same ProviderId 
         and having the same DateId.

      RevisionId is an optional positive integer indicating which 
        revision of a given data item this is. The use of the optional 
        RevisionId must be specified by the standard of the 
        corresponding data item. This includes requiring a mandatory 
        use of the RevisionId by the standard of the corresponding data 
        item. Any positive integer may be used as a RevisionId, but it 
        must always be the case that of two instances of a data item 
        that have the same ProviderId, DateId and NewsItemId, the one 
        whose RevisionId has the larger value must be the more recent 
        revision. A RevisionId of 0 is not permitted. 
 
      Update: when associated with NewsML 1 news items, if the news item 
        contains one or more NewsML 1 "Update" elements, then Update 
        must be set to "U".  If the news item consists only of a 
        replacement set of NewsML 1 NewsManagement data, then Update 
        must be set to "A". If neither of these is the case, or if the 
        URN is not associated with a NewsML 1 news item, then Update 
        must be omitted. 
 
 
   Identifier uniqueness considerations: 
 
      The ProviderId plus the DateId serves to uniquely identify the 
        organisation that is allocating the URN by the requirement that 
        the domain name of the ProviderId is registered to the 
        organisation on the day of the DateId. That organisation is 
        responsible for ensuring the uniqueness of the NewsItemId and 
        for the use of any RevisionId in line with the specification of 
        the standard of the data item schema. 
 
 
   Identifier persistence considerations: 
 
      A newsml-URN may only be allocated by an organisation that is 
         registered with the Internet domain name of the ProviderId on 
         the day of the DateId. As a domain name can only be registered 
         to one organisation on a specific day the combination of date 
         and domain name will uniquely identify that organisation as 
         long as the information about this registration will be 
         available. 
 
 
   Process of identifier assignment: 
 
      For a newsml-URN identified data item the organisation identified 
         by the ProviderId/DateId combination is responsible for  
         allocating a NewsItemId that is unique among all those that it  
         allocates with that ProviderId/DateId. 
 
   Process of identifier resolution: 
 
      Any resolution mechanism for newsml-URNs is optional. Providers of 
         newsml-URN-identified data items are responsible for the

Internet Draft  URN Namespace for news-related resources      July 2009 
 
         provision of such a resolution service if they have decided to 
         provide one. 
 
   Rules for Lexical Equivalence: 
 
      Newsml-URNs are lexically equivalent if the ProviderId, DateId, 
         NewsItemId, and - if used - the optional RevisionId and Update 
         indicator are all identical (case-insensitive comparison). 
 
   Conformance with URN Syntax: 
 
      No special considerations beyond the syntax herein described. 
 
   Validation mechanism: 
 
      Organisations that allocate newsml-URNs are responsible for the 
         provision of a URN validation service, if any, for URNs they 
         have assigned with a valid ProviderId/DateId combination. 
 
   Scope: 
 
      Newsml-URNs are intended for global use by any kind of news-
        related item. 
 
 
3. Examples 
 
   The following examples are representative of NewsML URNs, but may not 
   refer to actual resources. 
 
   urn:newsml:businesswire.com:20010714:20070403005477 
      The example above identifies all versions of an IPTC G2 item - as 
     it omits the RevisionId 
 
   urn:newsml:pressassociation.press.net:20001017:nmhp-home_news-37896:1 
      The example above identifies the first revision of a  
     news item 
 
   urn:newsml:afp.com:20030704:AFP_TX_PAR_20030704_114814_IHB86:2A 
     The example above identifies the first revision of a NewsML 1 
     NewsItem with NewsManagement data only 
 
   urn:newsml:reuters.com:20000206:IIMFFH05643_2000-02-06_17-54-01:3U 
     The example above identifies the third revision of a NewsML 1  
     NewsItem with Updates elements only 
 
 
4. Security Considerations 
 
   There are no additional security considerations other than those 
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general. 
 
5. Community Considerations.

   The NewsML user community is moving towards the adoption of XML 
   Schema and the use of XML formats for marking up content that is not 
   suited to a pure textual form such as that in W3C XHTML or IPTC News 
   Industry Text Format (NITF). At present there is no consistent way 
   in which to refer to these other namespaces that may need to be 
   included within NewsML and are required to be identified in a manner 
   that allows proper validation of the complete document instance. The 
   introduction of an additional new form of the newsml-URN designed to 
   identify such XML Schema will provide such a mechanism. This will 
   enable users to properly resolve the relevant namespaces to identify 
   the Schemas in a consistent fashion. 
 
6. IANA Considerations 
 
   This RFC includes an extended URN NID registration that is to be 
   entered into the IANA registry of URN NIDs as an update to the 
   existing registration of the NID string "newsml". 
    
   The NID string "newsml" is requested again. It was previously 
   assigned under RFC 3085 and meets the IETF constraints for URN 
   naming.
