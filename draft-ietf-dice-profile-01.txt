1.  Introduction

   This document defines a DTLS 1.2 [RFC6347] profile that offers
   communication security for Internet of Things (IoT) applications and
   is reasonably implementable on many constrained devices.  It aims to
   meet the following goals:

   o  Serve as a one-stop shop for implementers to know which pieces of
      the specification jungle contain relevant details.

   o  Not alter the DTLS specification.

   o  Not introduce any new extensions.

   o  Align with the DTLS security modes of the Constrained Application
      Protocol (CoAP) [I-D.ietf-core-coap].

   DTLS is used to secure a number of applications run over an
   unreliable datagram transport.  CoAP [I-D.ietf-core-coap] is one such
   protocol and has been designed specifically for use in IoT
   environments.  CoAP can be secured a number of different ways, also
   called security modes.  These security modes are as follows, see
   Section 5, Section 6, Section 7 for additional details:

Internet-Draft          DTLS 1.2 Profile for IoT                May 2014


   No Security Protection at the Transport Layer:  No DTLS is used but
      instead application layer security functionality is assumed.

   Shared Secret-based DTLS Authentication:  DTLS supports the use of
      shared secrets [RFC4279].  This mode is useful if the number of
      communication relationships between the IoT device and servers is
      small and for very constrained devices.  Shared secret-based
      authentication mechanisms offer good performance and require a
      minimum of data to be exchanged.

   DTLS Authentication using Asymmetric Cryptography:  TLS supports
      client and server authentication using asymmetric cryptography.
      Two approaches for validating these public keys are available.
      First, [I-D.ietf-tls-oob-pubkey] allows raw public keys to be used
      in TLS without the overhead of certificates.  This approach
      requires out-of-band validation of the public key.  Second, the
      use of X.509 certificates [RFC5280] with TLS is common on the Web
      today (at least for server-side authentication) and certain IoT
      environments may also re-use those capabilities.  Certificates
      bind an identifier to the public key signed by a certification
      authority (CA).  A trust anchor store has to be provisioned on the
      device to indicate what CAs are trusted.  Furthermore, the
      certificate may contain a wealth of other information used to make
      authorization decisions.

   As described in [I-D.ietf-lwig-tls-minimal], an application designer
   developing an IoT device needs to consider the security threats and
   the security services that can be used to mitigate the threats.
   Enabling devices to upload data and retrieve configuration
   information, inevitably requires that Internet-connected devices be
   able to authenticate themselves to servers and vice versa as well as
   to ensure that the data and information exchanged is integrity and
   confidentiality protected.  While these security services can be
   provided at different layers in the protocol stack the use of
   communication security, as offered by DTLS, has been very popular on
   the Internet and it is likely to be useful for IoT scenarios as well.
   In case the communication security features offered by DTLS meet the
   security requirements of your application the remainder of the
   document might offer useful guidance.

   Not every IoT deployment will use CoAP but the discussion regarding
   choice of credentials and cryptographic algorithms will be very
   similar.  As such, the discussions in this document are applicable
   beyond the use of the CoAP protocol.

   The design of DTLS is intentionally very similar to TLS.  Since DTLS
   operates on top of an unreliable datagram transport a few
   enhancements to the TLS structure are, however necessary.  RFC 6347

   explains these differences in great detail.  As a short summary, for
   those not familiar with DTLS the differences are:

   o  An explicit sequence number and an epoch field is included in the
      TLS Record Layer.  Section 4.1 of RFC 6347 explains the processing
      rules for these two new fields.  The value used to compute the MAC
      is the 64-bit value formed by concatenating the epoch and the
      sequence number.

   o  Stream ciphers must not be used with DTLS.  The only stream cipher
      defined for TLS 1.2 is RC4 and due to cryptographic weaknesses it
      is not recommended anymore even for use with TLS.

   o  The TLS Handshake Protocol has been enhanced to include a
      stateless cookie exchange for Denial of Service (DoS) resistance.
      Furthermore, the header has been extended to deal with message
      loss, reordering, and fragmentation.  Retransmission timers have
      been included to deal with message loss.  For DoS protection a new
      handshake message, the HelloVerifyRequest, was added to DTLS.
      This handshake message is sent by the server and includes a
      stateless cookie, which is returned in a ClientHello message back
      to the server.  This type of DoS protection mechanism has also
      been incorporated into the design of IKEv2.  Although the exchange
      is optional for the server to execute, a client implementation has
      to be prepared to respond to it.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "MUST", "MUST NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Note that "Client" and "Server" in this document refer to TLS roles,
   where the Client initiates the TLS handshake.  This does not restrict
   the interaction pattern of the protocols carried inside TLS as the
   record layer allows bi-directional communication.  In the case of
   CoAP the "Client" can act as a CoAP Server or Client.

3.  The Communication Model

   This document describes a profile of DTLS 1.2 and, to be useful, it
   has to make assumptions about the envisioned communication
   architecture.

   The communication architecture shown in Figure 1 assumes a uni-cast
   communication interaction with an IoT device utilizing a DTLS client
   and that client interacts with one or multiple DTLS servers.

   Clients are preconfigured with the address or addresses of servers
   (e.g., as part of the firmware) they will communicate with as well as
   authentication information:

   o  For PSK-based authentication (see Section 5), this includes the
      paired "PSK identity" and shared secret to be used with each
      server.

   o  For raw public key-based authentication (see Section 6), this
      includes either the server's public key or the hash of the
      server's public key.

   o  For certificate-based authentication (see Section 7), this may
      include a pre-populated trust anchor store that allows the client
      to perform path validation for the certificate obtained during the
      handshake with the server.

   This document only focuses on the description of the DTLS client-side
   functionality.

4.  The Ciphersuite Concept

   TLS (and consequently DTLS) has the concept of ciphersuites and an
   IANA registry [IANA-TLS] was created to register the suites.  A
   ciphersuite (and the specification that defines it) contains the
   following information:

   o  Authentication and Key Exchange Algorithm (e.g., PSK)

   o  Cipher and Key Length (e.g., AES with 128 bit keys)

   o  Mode of operation (e.g., CBC)

Internet-Draft          DTLS 1.2 Profile for IoT                May 2014


   o  Hash Algorithm for Integrity Protection (e.g., SHA in combination
      with HMAC)

   o  Hash Algorithm for use with the Pseudorandom Function (e.g. HMAC
      with the SHA-256)

   o  Misc information (e.g., length of authentication tags)

   o  Information whether the ciphersuite is suitable for DTLS or only
      for TLS

   The TLS ciphersuite TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8, for example, uses a
   pre-shared authentication and key exchange algorithm.  RFC 6655
   [RFC6655] defines this ciphersuite.  It uses the Advanced Encryption
   Standard (AES) encryption algorithm, which is a block cipher.  Since
   the AES algorithm supports different key lengths (such as 128, 192
   and 256 bits) this information has to be specified as well and the
   selected ciphersuite supports 128 bit keys.  A block cipher encrypts
   plaintext in fixed-size blocks and AES operates on fixed block size
   of 128 bits.  For messages exceeding 128 bits, the message is
   partitioned into 128-bit blocks and the AES cipher is applied to
   these input blocks with appropriate chaining, which is called mode of
   operation.

   TLS 1.2 introduced Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data
   (AEAD) ciphersuites [RFC5116].  AEAD is a class of block cipher modes
   which encrypt (parts of) the message and authenticate the message
   simultaneously.  Examples of such modes include the Counter with CBC-
   MAC (CCM) mode, and the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM).

   Some AEAD ciphersuites have shorter authentication tags and are
   therefore more suitable for networks with low bandwidth where small
   message size matters.  The TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8 ciphersuite
   that ends in "_8" has an 8-octet authentication tag, while the
   regular CCM ciphersuites have 16-octet authentication tags.

   TLS 1.2 also replaced the combination of MD5/SHA-1 hash functions in
   the TLS pseudo random function (PRF) with cipher-suite-specified
   PRFs.  For this reason authors of more recent TLS 1.2 ciphersuite
   specifications explicitly indicate the MAC algorithm and the hash
   functions used with the TLS PRF.

   This document references the CoAP recommended ciphersuite choices,
   which have been selected based on implementation and deployment
   experience from the IoT community.  Over time the preference for
   certain algorithms will, however, change.  Not all components of a
   ciphersuite change at the same speed.  Changes are more likely to
   expect for ciphers, the mode of operation, and the hash algorithms.

   Some deployment environments will also be impacted by local
   regulation, which might dictate a certain and less likely for public
   key algorithms (such as RSA vs. ECC).

5.  Pre-Shared Secret Authentication with DTLS

   The use of pre-shared secret credentials is one of the most basic
   techniques for DTLS since it is both computational efficient and
   bandwidth conserving.  Pre-shared secret based authentication was
   introduced to TLS with RFC 4279 [RFC4279].  The exchange shown in
   Figure 2 illustrates the DTLS exchange including the cookie exchange.
   While the server is not required to initiate a cookie exchange with
   every handshake, the client is required to implement and to react on
   it when challenged.

   [RFC4279] does not mandate the use of any particular type of
   identity.  Hence, the TLS client and server clearly have to agree on
   the identities and keys to be used.  The mandated encoding of
   identities in Section 5.1 of RFC 4279 aims to improve
   interoperability for those cases where the identity is configured by

   a person using some management interface.  Many IoT devices do,
   however, not have a user interface and most of their credentials are
   bound to the device rather than the user.  Furthermore, credentials
   are provisioned into trusted hardware modules or in the firmware by
   the developers.  As such, the encoding considerations are not
   applicable to this usage environment.  For use with this profile the
   PSK identities SHOULD NOT assume a structured format (as domain
   names, Distinguished Names, or IP addresses have) and a bit-by-bit
   comparison operation can then be used by the server-side
   infrastructure.

   As described in Section 3 clients may have pre-shared keys with
   several different servers.  The client indicates which key it uses by
   including a "PSK identity" in the ClientKeyExchange message.  To help
   the client in selecting which PSK identity / PSK pair to use, the
   server can provide a "PSK identity hint" in the ServerKeyExchange
   message.  For IoT environments a simplifying assumption is made that
   the hint for PSK key selection is based on the domain name of the
   server.  Hence, servers SHOULD NOT send the "PSK identity hint" in
   the ServerKeyExchange message and client MUST ignore the message.
   This approach is inline with RFC 4279 [RFC4279].

   RFC 4279 requires TLS implementations supporting PSK ciphersuites to
   support arbitrary PSK identities up to 128 octets in length, and
   arbitrary PSKs up to 64 octets in length.  This is a useful
   assumption for TLS stacks used in the desktop and mobile environment
   where management interfaces are used to provision identities and
   keys.  For the IoT environment, however, many devices are not
   equipped with displays and input devices (e.g., keyboards).  Hence,
   keys are distributed as part of hardware modules or are embedded into
   the firmware.  As such, these restrictions are not applicable to this
   profile.

   Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [I-D.ietf-core-coap]
   currently specifies TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8 as the mandatory to
   implement ciphersuite for use with shared secrets.  This ciphersuite
   uses the AES algorithm with 128 bit keys and CCM as the mode of
   operation.  The label "_8" indicates that an 8-octet authentication
   tag is used.  This ciphersuite makes use of the default TLS 1.2
   Pseudorandom Function (PRF), which uses HMAC with the SHA-256 hash
   function.

6.  Raw Public Key Use with DTLS

   The use of raw public keys with DTLS, as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-tls-oob-pubkey], is the first entry point into public key
   cryptography without having to pay the price of certificates and a
   PKI.  The specification re-uses the existing Certificate message to

   convey the raw public key encoded in the SubjectPublicKeyInfo
   structure.  To indicate support two new TLS extensions had been
   defined, as shown in Figure 3, namely the server_certificate_type and
   the client_certificate_type.  To operate this mechanism securely it
   is necessary to authenticate and authorize the public keys out-of-
   band.  This document therefore assumes that a client implementation
   comes with one or multiple raw public keys of servers, it has to
   communicate with, pre-provisioned.  Additionally, a device will have
   its own raw public key.  To replace, delete, or add raw public key to
   this list requires a software update, for example using a firmware

Internet-Draft          DTLS 1.2 Profile for IoT                May 2014


   This elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) based AES-CCM TLS ciphersuite
   uses the Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDHE) as the key
   establishment mechanism and an Elliptic Curve Digital Signature
   Algorithm (ECDSA) for authentication.  This ciphersuite make use of
   the AEAD capability in DTLS 1.2 and utilizes an eight-octet
   authentication tag.  Based on the Diffie-Hellman it provides perfect
   forward secrecy (PFS).  More details about the PFS can be found in
   Section 11.

   RFC 6090 [RFC6090] provides valuable information for implementing
   Elliptic Curve Cryptography algorithms.

   Since many IoT devices will either have limited ways to log error or
   no ability at all, any error will lead to implementations attempting
   to re-try the exchange.

7.  Certificate Use with DTLS

   The use of mutual certificate-based authentication is shown in
   Figure 4, which makes use of the cached info extension
   [I-D.ietf-tls-cached-info].  Support of the cached info extension is
   required.  Caching certificate chains allows the client to reduce the
   communication overhead significantly since otherwise the server would
   provide the end entity certificate, and the certificate chain.
   Because certificate validation requires that root keys be distributed
   independently, the self-signed certificate that specifies the root
   certificate authority is omitted from the chain.  Client
   implementations MUST be provisioned with a trust anchor store that
   contains the root certificates.  The use of the Trust Anchor
   Management Protocol (TAMP) [RFC5934] is, however, not envisioned.
   Instead IoT devices using this profile MUST rely a software update
   mechanism to provision these trust anchors.

   When DTLS is used to secure CoAP messages then the server provided
   certificates MUST contain the fully qualified DNS domain name or
   "FQDN".  The coaps URI scheme is described in Section 6.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-core-coap].  This FQDN is stored in the SubjectAltName or
   in the CN, as explained in Section 9.1.3.3 of [I-D.ietf-core-coap],
   and used by the client to match it against the FQDN used during the
   look-up process, as described in RFC 6125 [RFC6125].  For the profile
   in this specification does not assume dynamic discovery of local
   servers.

   For client certificates the identifier used in the SubjectAltName or
   in the CN MUST be an EUI-64 [EUI64], as mandated in Section 9.1.3.3
   of [I-D.ietf-core-coap].

   For certificate revocation neither the Online Certificate Status
   Protocol (OCSP) nor Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) are used.
   Instead, this profile relies on a software update mechanism.  While
   multiple OCSP stapling [RFC6961] has recently been introduced as a
   mechanism to piggyback OCSP request/responses inside the DTLS/TLS
   handshake to avoid the cost of a separate protocol handshake further
   investigations are needed to determine its suitability for the IoT
   environment.

8.  Error Handling

   DTLS uses the Alert protocol to convey error messages and specifies a
   longer list of errors.  However, not all error messages defined in
   the TLS specification are applicable to this profile.  All error
   messages marked as RESERVED are only supported for backwards
   compatibility with SSL and are therefore not applicable to this
   profile.  Those include decryption_failed_RESERVED,
   no_certificate_RESERVE, and export_restriction_RESERVED.  A number of
   the error messages are applicable only for certificate-based
   authentication ciphersuites.  Hence, for PSK and raw public key use
   the following error messages are not applicable: bad_certificate,
   unsupported_certificate, certificate_revoked, certificate_expired,
   certificate_unknown, unknown_ca, and access_denied.

   Since this profile does not make use of compression at the TLS layer
   the decompression_failure error message is not applicable either.

   RFC 4279 introduced a new alert message unknown_psk_identity for PSK
   ciphersuites.  As stated in Section 2 of RFC 4279 the
   decryption_error error message may also be used instead.  For this
   profile the TLS server MUST return the decryption_error error message
   instead of the unknown_psk_identity.

   Furthermore, the following errors should not occur based on the
   description in this specification:

   protocol_version:  This document only focuses on one version of the
      DTLS protocol.

   insufficient_security:  This error message indicates that the server
      requires ciphers to be more secure.  This document does, however,
      specify the only acceptable ciphersuites and client
      implementations must support them.

   user_canceled:  The IoT devices in focus of this specification are
      assumed to be unattended.

9.  Session Resumption

   Session resumption is a feature of DTLS that allows a client to
   continue with an earlier established session state.  The resulting
   exchange is shown in Figure 5.  In addition, the server may choose
   not to do a cookie exchange when a session is resumed.  Still,
   clients have to be prepared to do a cookie exchange with every
   handshake.

                    Figure 5: DTLS Session Resumption.

   Clients MUST implement session resumption to improve the performance
   of the handshake (in terms of reduced number of message exchanges,
   lower computational overhead, and less bandwidth conserved).

   Since the communication model described in Section 3 does not assume
   that the server is constrained.  RFC 5077 [RFC5077] describing TLS
   session resumption without server-side state is not utilized by this
   profile.

10.  TLS Compression

   [I-D.sheffer-tls-bcp] recommends to always disable DTLS-level
   compression due to attacks.  For IoT applications compression at the
   DTLS is not needed since application layer protocols are highly
   optimized and the compression algorithms at the DTLS layer increase
   code size and complexity.  Hence, for use with this profile
   compression at the DTLS layer SHOULD NOT be implemented by the DTLS
   client.

11.  Perfect Forward Secrecy

   Perfect forward secrecy is designed to prevent the compromise of a
   long-term secret key from affecting the confidentiality of past
   conversations.  The PSK ciphersuite recommended in the CoAP
   specification [I-D.ietf-core-coap] does not offer this property.
   [I-D.sheffer-tls-bcp] on the other hand recommends using ciphersuites
   offering this security property.

   QUESTION: Should the PSK ciphersuite offer PFS?

12.  Keep-Alive

   RFC 6520 [RFC6520] defines a heartbeat mechanism to test whether the
   other peer is still alive.  The same mechanism can also be used to
   perform path MTU discovery.

   QUESTION: Do IoT deployments make use of this extension?

13.  Negotiation and Downgrading Attacks

   CoAP demands version 1.2 of DTLS to be used and the earlier version
   of DTLS is not supported.  As such, there is no risk of downgrading
   to an older version of DTLS.  The work described in
   [I-D.bmoeller-tls-downgrade-scsv] is therefore also not applicable to
   this environment since there is no legacy server infrastructure to
   worry about.

   QUESTION: Should we say something for non-CoAP use of DTLS?

   To prevent the TLS renegotiation attack [RFC5746] clients MUST
   respond to server-initiated renegotiation attempts with an Alert
   message (no_renegotiation) and clients MUST NOT initiate them.  TLS
   and DTLS allows a client and a server who already have a TLS
   connection to negotiate new parameters, generate new keys, etc by
   initiating a TLS handshake using a ClientHello message.
   Renegotiation happens in the existing TLS connection, with the new
   handshake packets being encrypted along with application data.

14.  Privacy Considerations

   The DTLS handshake exchange conveys various identifiers, which can be
   observed by an on-path eavesdropper.  For example, the DTLS PSK
   exchange reveals the PSK identity, the supported extensions, the
   session id, algorithm parameters, etc.  When session resumption is
   used then individual TLS sessions can be correlated by an on-path
   adversary.  With many IoT deployments it is likely that keying
   material and their identifiers are persistent over a longer period of
   time due to the cost of updating software on these devices.

   User participation with many IoT deployments poses a challenge since
   many of the IoT devices operate unattended, even though they will
   initially be enabled by a human.  The ability to control data sharing
   and to configure preference will have to be provided at a system
   level rather than at the level of a DTLS profile, which is the scope
   of this document.  Quite naturally, the use of DTLS with mutual
   authentication will allow a TLS server to collect authentication
   information about the IoT device (potentially over a long period of
   time).  While this strong form of authentication will prevent mis-

Internet-Draft          DTLS 1.2 Profile for IoT                May 2014


   attribution it also allows strong identification.  This device-
   related data collection (e.g., sensor recordings) will be associated
   with other data to be truly useful and this extra data might include
   personal data about the owner of the device or data about the
   environment it senses.  Consequently, the data stored on the server-
   side will be vulnerable to stored data compromise.  For the
   communication between the client and the server this specification
   prevents eavesdroppers to gain access to the communication content.
   While the PSK-based ciphersuite does not provide PFS the asymmetric
   version does.  No explicit techniques, such as extra padding, have
   been provided to make traffic analysis more difficult.

15.  Security Considerations

   This entire document is about security.

   The TLS protocol requires random numbers to be available during the
   protocol run.  For example, during the ClientHello and the
   ServerHello exchange the client and the server exchange random
   numbers.  Also, the use of the Diffie Hellman exchange requires
   random numbers during the key pair generation.  Special care has to
   be paid when generating random numbers in embedded systems as many
   entropy sources available on desktop operating systems or mobile
   devices might be missing, as described in [Heninger].  Consequently,
   if not enough time is given during system start time to fill the
   entropy pool then the output might be predictable and repeatable, for
   example leading to the same keys generated again and again.
   Guidelines and requirements for random number generation can be found
   in RFC 4086 [RFC4086].

   We would also like to point out that designing a software update
   mechanism into an IoT system is crucial to ensure that both
   functionality can be enhanced and that potential vulnerabilities can
   be fixed.  This software update mechanism is also useful for changing
   configuration information, for example, trust anchors and other
   keying related information.

16.  IANA Considerations

   This document includes no request to IANA.
