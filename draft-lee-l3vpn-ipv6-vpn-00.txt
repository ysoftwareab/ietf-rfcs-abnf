1. Introduction 

    

   This text describes a kind of VPN based on the IPv6 address structure. 
   The Ipv6 address has been widely used for addressing in the site and 
   subnet. But it hasn't been used for addressing between sites in VPN 
   yet. There are enough bits available in IPv6 addresses to allow us to 
   embed a VPN site ID in the IPv6 address, so that no encapsulation 
   overhead is required to achieve isolation between VPNs. Meanwhile, 
   VPN site ID can serve as an aggregation route to a site. Between 
   sites in the same VPN, routes are reachable. Between sites in

   different VPNs, routes are unreachable. In this way, VPNs may be 
   formed in a great variety of topologies.       

   Addresses used for mutual access in VPN are named VPN addresses. 
   Their forms differ in VPN from those in Internet, who are named the 
   VPN-local address and the global VPN address respectively. Compared 
   with the internal VPN address, the global VPN address increases VPN 
   site ID and carries out address translation by site edge devices. 

   The VPN addresses defined in this text do not conflict with the 
   unique local IPv6 unicast addresses defined in [UNILOCAL]. As a 
   special local VPN address, the latter is not used for addressing in 
   the public network, while the global VPN address is used for 
   addressing in the public network. On site edge devices, unique local 
   IPv6 unicast addresses can also be translated to global VPN addresses. 

   For the sake of supporting multicast, assign specific multicast 
   addresses for VPN. Similar to VPN site ID, site edge devices embed 
   VPN group ID in VPN multicast addresses. 

   Routing and forwarding of packets in VPN is the same as that in the 
   site, and VPN hosts cannot tell the difference between mutual access 
   in the site and mutual access in VPN. Therefore, the defined unicast 
   and multicast address formats in VPN are the same as addresses in the 
   site. Thus, hosts do not need modification. While addressing between 
   sites or on Internet, the global VPN address is similar to the public 
   network address of Internet in both format and routing and forwarding 
   mode. Moreover, Internet addressing can be easily carried out on 
   devices.      

   For composing several sites into a VPN, this text defines VPN 
   topology discovery mechanism.  

   This kind of VPN has the following features: 

   1. VPN information is embedded in the IPv6 address, so there is no 
   additional cost in VPN packets encapsulation. 

   2. The forward process of VPN packets is consistent with that of the 
   average IP packets, so VPN traffic can be born on the pure IPv6 
   network. 

   3. Use VPN site ID as the valid global site identifier, as the 
   aggregation route to reach the site and as the basis on which VPN 
   topology forms. VPN site ID can be identical with global routing 
   prefix of this site.

   4. Site edge routes take charge of updating VPN information and 
   ensuring the security of VPN information. 

   The reference model of this VPN is shown as follows. 

      ...........               ..................                ............ 
      .         .         .     .                .                .          . 
      .  VPN1   .   +-------+   .                .   +-------+    .  VPN2    . 
      .  Site1  .---|       |   .                .---|  SE2  |----.  Site2   . 
      ...........   |       |   .     Public     .   +-------+    ............ 
                    |  SE1  |---.      IPv6      .                             
      ...........   |       |   .     Network    .   +-------+    ............ 
      .         .---|       |   .                .---|  SE3  |----.          . 
      .  VPN2   .   +-------+   .                .   +-------+    .  VPN1    . 
      .  Site1  .               .                .                .  Site2   . 
      ...........               ..................                ............ 
    

   The device at the boundary between the VPN site and the public 
   network is named Site Edge router (SE). When SE belongs to operators, 
   this model becomes PE-based VPN. When SE belongs to clients, this 
   model becomes CE-based VPN. 

2. VPN Address 

   Two kinds of VPN addresses are defined to carry out VPN addressing 
   within VPN and on the public network. 

  2.1. VPN-Local Addresses 

   The VPN-local address is similar to the link-local address and the 
   site-local address. It's encapsulated by hosts. Valid only within VPN, 
   this address can help complete interconnection in VPN. 

   The unicast address structure is as follows. 

      |  10 bits |    38 bits   | 16 bits  |       64 bits          | 

      +----------+-------------------------+------------------------+ 

      |1111111011|   reserved   | subnet ID|     interface ID       | 

      +----------+-------------------------+------------------------+

Internet-Draft      IPv6 VPN based Address Format         October 2005 
    

   Through using the same type prefix (1111111011) of the site-local 
   address, the current hosts and routers can use the VPN-local address 
   without changing.  

   If sites have used unique local IPv6 unicast addresses that are 
   defined in [UNILOCAL], they can continue to use it. 

   Multicast address structure is as follows. 

       |   8    |  4 |  4 |            80            |        32        | 

       +--------+----+----+---------------------------------------------+ 

       |11111111|flgs|scop|         reserved         |    group ID      | 

       +--------+----+----+---------------------------------------------+ 

   The flgs field contains four bits. 

   +-+-+-+-+ 

   |V|R|P|T| 

   +-+-+-+-+ 

   V bit(the ninth bit)refers to the VPN multicast address. In VPN, it 
   is set as 0. For details about R bit and P bit, see [ADDR ARCH]. T 
   bit (the twelfth bit) implies that the multicast address is not 
   permanent, which is set as 1. The scop field (from the thirteen bit 
   to the sixteen bit) is set as 0101, which is the same as the valid 
   multicast address in the site. Thus, the current hosts and routers 
   can use the VPN-local multicast address without changing. 

         
  2.2. Global VPN Addresses 

   The global VPN address is used for destination addressing in VPN on 
   the public network. Routers on the public network only consider how 
   to reach a VPN site and which VPN site to reach, without considering 
   how to reach the destination within the VPN site. 

   Global VPN addresses are different from global public network 
   addresses. Routers must prevent global VPN addresses of different 
   VPNs from mutual access. 

   Unicast address structure is as follows:

Internet-Draft      IPv6 VPN based Address Format         October 2005 
    

       | 3 |     45 bits         |  16 bits  |       64 bits              | 

       +---+---------------------+-----------+----------------------------+ 

       |010|    VPN site ID      | subnet ID |       interface ID         | 

       +---+---------------------+-----------+----------------------------+ 

       |Global VPN routing prefix| 

   Global VPN routing prefix contains a prefix 010 and a VPN site ID. 
   The former is separated from global public network addresses, and the 
   latter is used for addressing a VPN site in the public network. 
   Subnet ID and interface ID are only used to save internal VPN unicast 
   addresses. When addressing in the public network, they are neglected. 

   Multicast address structure is as follows. 

       |   8    |  4 |  4 |       48     |     32       |      32       | 

       +--------+----+----+--------------+--------------+---------------+ 

       |11111111|flgs|scop|    reserved  | VPN group ID |local group ID | 

       +--------+----+----+--------------+--------------+---------------+ 

   VPN group ID causes site edge devices (but I'm guessing here - please 
   let me know if I misunderstood) to transmit multicast packets between 
   sites of VPN. V bit in flgs field is set as 1, which refers to a VPN 
   multicast address. The scop field is set as 1110, which refers to a 
   valid global multicast address. The local group ID is used to save 
   internal VPN multicast addresses, which can be neglected when 
   addressing in the public network. Or combining with the VPN group ID, 
   it can be used for addressing in the public network.  

         
  2.3. Mapping between Global VPN Addresses and VPN-local Addresses 

   Mutual mapping can be carried out between Global VPN unicast 
   addresses and VPN-local unicast addresses. During the mapping, 
   interface ID and subnet ID do not change, but different prefixes will 
   be added and VPN site ID will be deleted or added to global addresses 
   or local addresses.

Internet-Draft      IPv6 VPN based Address Format         October 2005 
    

   If unique local IPv6 unicast addresses are used, mutual translation 
   should be carried out between global ID and VPN site ID and different 
   prefixes should be added to them during the mapping. 

   Global VPN multicast addresses generate through the mapping from 
   local addresses. During the mapping, different flags and scop fields 
   are set and VPN group IDs are added or deleted for them. 

3. Allocating VPN Site ID 

   When the global routing prefix is assigned to a site, it can be used 
   as VPN site ID. Global VPN unicast addresses and global unicast 
   addresses are identical in format but different in prefix. The prefix 
   of the former is 010, while that of the latter is 001. VPN site ID 
   corresponds to global routing prefix. Therefore, a site can 
   distinguish Internet from VPN by using different prefixes while 
   accessing them.  

   Independent of global routing prefix, allocating VPN site ID can be 
   completed, as long as it is the unique one in the global.  

4. VPN Topology  

   <Text for this section> 

   VPN is composed of multiple sites. VPN topology refers to the 
   connection between each site. If some sites belong to the same VPN, 
   their routes are reachable. If not, their routes are unreachable. In 
   Global VPN addresses, site ID is used to identify sites. Moreover, 
   through site ID, there are several methods to learn which VPN a site 
   belongs to.  

   Method one: Use some fields in VPN site ID to identify VPN, that is, 
   VPN ID. If some sites belong to the same VPN, they have the same VPN 
   ID. 

   The format of VPN site ID is as follows.  

   |      29 bits   |     16 bits        | 

   +-------------------------------------+ 

   |      VPN ID    |     Site ID        | 

   +-------------------------------------+

Internet-Draft      IPv6 VPN based Address Format         October 2005 
    

   Method two: Append route attributes to VPN site ID so as to express 
   VPN topology. Route attributes can use the format of BGP extension 
   community attributes, that is, Route Target (RT) [EXT COMM]. 

   Method three: Through static configuration on SEs to determine 
   between which sites exists VPN relation. 

  4.1. VPN Topology Discovery Process 

   Using the first VPN site ID method:  

   While initializing, SE sets VPN site ID containing VPN ID. Based on 
   VPN site ID, SE generates an IPv6 aggregation route, that is, 010:VPN 
   site ID::/48, which is named the VPN site route. SE advertises it to 
   backbone router and other SEs. Destination SE matches with VPN ID of 
   locally configured VPN site ID, based on the information about VPN ID 
   of VPN site route. If they are identical, this route is installed. If 
   not, it is dropped. Thus, routes between sites in the same VPN are 
   reachable, while routes between sites in different VPNs are 
   unreachable.  

   Using the second VPN site ID method: 

   While initializing, SE sets VPN site containing VPN site ID, the 
   ingress RT list and the egress RT list. Based on such information, SE 
   generates an IPv6 aggregation route, that is, 010:VPN site ID::/48 
   and appends RT extension community attribute contained in the egress 
   RT list. SE advertises it to backbone router and other SEs. 
   Destination SE matches with the local ingress RT list, based on RTs 
   of the VPN route. If at least one RT is identical, this route is 
   installed. If not, it is dropped. Thus, based on RT matching 
   relationship, a wide variety of VPN topologies can be constructed, 
   such as, full mesh and hub-spoke as well as Intranet and Extranet. 

   Using the third VPN site ID method: 

   While initializing, SE sets the VPN site. SE generates an IPv6 
   aggregation route, that is, 010:VPN site ID::/48 and advertises it to 
   backbone router and other SEs. Destination SE judges which VPN it 
   belongs to and determines to install or drop this route, based on the 
   locally configured site list. 

   If using unique local IPv6 unicast addresses, sites need to advertise 
   the global ID to other SEs accompanies the above processes. 

   To support multicast in VPN, set VPN group ID on SE when the VPN site 
   is configured. Then, SE joins to this multicast group specified by

Internet-Draft      IPv6 VPN based Address Format         October 2005 
    

   VPN group ID through multicast routing protocols. This group is used 
   to propagate internal VPN multicast packets in the public network, 
   including each local group. However, if no host joins to a local 
   group within a site, it's unnecessary that the SE connected to this 
   site still receives multicast packets from the SE connected to 
   multicast source. Optimization method is as follows: Through 
   multicast routing protocols, SE joins to the multicast group 
   specified by VPN group ID + local group ID. This method aims at some 
   specific local groups. For example, traffic in this local group is 
   large, or only a fraction of sites join to this local group.  

   No matter which method is used, each site has a VPN site list on SE. 
   The list contains ID of other sites who have VPN relation with the 
   site. If using unique local IPv6 unicast addresses, each site has an 
   additional global ID. Thus, a mapping table comes into being between 
   a VPN site ID and a global ID. 

  4.2. Establishing Site Route Table 

   Each site generates a route table on SE. The table contains the route 
   of this site as well as routes of all sites that have VPN relation 
   with this site. 

   Internal routes of a site can be obtained from the internal of sites 
   through static configuration or routing protocols. 

   Aggregation routes to other sites can be obtained during topology 
   discovery, as described in the above section. 

   Internal routes of other sites can be obtained from routing protocols 
   between SEs. When SE advertises VPN routes to other sites, it should 
   specify an attribute for these routes to indicate where they come 
   from, that is, VPN site ID. If multiple VPN routes are installed on 
   SE, VPN site ID can be used to distinguish different VPN routes to 
   ensure the uniqueness of routes. After the destination SE receives 
   this route, check which local site and this route belong to the same 
   VPN so that install it to a route table that is related to this site.  

5. VPN Packet Forward 

  5.1. Forward within the Site 

   When forwarding within the site, both source addresses and 
   destination addresses use the VPN-local address format without adding 
   VPN site ID or VPN group ID. Standard unicast or multicast forward 
   mechanism is also tolerable.

Internet-Draft      IPv6 VPN based Address Format         October 2005 
    

  5.2. Forward on SE at the Ingress  

   First of all, use interface or sub interface or packet header to 
   judge which site the packets come from. After judgment, as for 
   unicast packets, add site ID, translate source addresses into global 
   VPN addresses, and search site route tables by destination addresses 
   for destination site ID. Translate destination addresses into global 
   VPN addresses and forward to the next hop based on the destination 
   site ID.  

   As for multicast packets, add source site ID, translate source 
   addresses into global VPN addresses, and add VPN group ID based on 
   VPN of the site. Then translate destination addresses into global VPN 
   multicast addresses based on VPN group ID, search multicast route 
   tables and forward them. 

  5.3. Forward in the Public Network 

   During VPN topology discovery, an aggregation route to the 
   destination site is obtained. Therefore, unicast packets use the 
   standard IPv6 routing and forwarding mechanism to reach SE at the 
   egress.  

   Multicast packets search the multicast route table based on VPN group 
   ID + local group ID in global VPN multicast addresses. If only the 
   route of VPN group ID exists in the route table, forward packets on 
   the basis of this aggregation route. If there is the route of VPN 
   group ID + local group ID, forward packets on the basis of this 
   precise route. Different from standard multicast forwarding process, 
   this multicast forwarding process is carried out through longest 
   matching method similar to unicast forwarding, which is named 
   multicast longest matching forwarding. 

  5.4. Forward on SE at the Egress 

   For unicast packets, locate the local site route table based on VPN 
   site ID in the destination address, translate source and destination 
   addresses into the VPN-local address, and search the site route table 
   and then forward packets into site. In this process, if the unique 
   local IPv6 unicast address is used, the VPN site ID of the source and 
   destination address is mapped to corresponding global ID. 

   For multicast packets, locate the local site based on VPN group ID in 
   the destination address, translate the source address into the VPN-
   local address, and translate the destination address into the VPN-
   local multicast address and then forward packets based on the local 
   group ID.

6. Internet Access 

   VPN sites can access Internet and other sites of VPN at the same time. 
   In the case of internet access, VPN-local addressed need to be 
   translated into global Internet addresses. 

   The format is shown as RFC3587. 

   | 3 |     45 bits         |  16 bits  |       64 bits              | 

   +---+---------------------+-----------+----------------------------+ 

   |001|global routing prefix| subnet ID |       interface ID         | 

   +---+---------------------+-----------+----------------------------+ 

   The global routing prefix can be identical with VPN site ID. 

   This translation should be completed by terminals. The global routing 
   Prefix can be obtained by automatic configuration mechanism defined 
   in RFC2462 from SE.  

   Internet cannot access internal VPN multicast addresses.  

7. Overriding Autonomous System 

   VPN uses the standard IPv6 routing and forwarding mechanism while 
   forwarding packets. Therefore, when overriding Autonomous System (AS), 
   VPN just needs to advertise VPN site and VPN group routes to the 
   neighboring AS to ensure routes are reachable between sites of the 
   same VPN. Then, internal site routes are advertised between SEs of 
   the same VPN.  

8. Interconnecting with IPv4 Sites 

   This technology is also used to interconnect multiple IPv4 networks 
   through IPv6 backbone networks or access VPN user who have used IPv4 
   addresses. 

   By now, SE still assigns VPN site ID for each IPv4 site and a VPN 
   group ID for multicast of this site. SE meanwhile maintains an IPv4 
   route table for this site. But this kind of IPv4 route carries a 
   route attribute, which contains VPN site ID. 

   After obtaining the IPv4 route within the site, SE appends a VPN site 
   ID attribute and advertises it to other SEs. Then destination SE

   checks whether this site and a local site belong to the same VPN. If 
   so, this route is installed. If not, it is dropped. 

   For the unicast packet entering SE, confirm which site it comes from 
   based on the inbound interface or sub-interface, search this site's 
   IPv4 route table, find the destination site ID and translate source 
   and destination IPv4 addresses into VPN IPv4-embedded IPv6 address. 
   The format is based IPv4-embedded IPv6 address defined by IP Version 
   6 Addressing Architecture, and add VPN site ID. It's shown as follows.  

   | 3 |           45 bits           |   32   | 16 |      32 bits        | 

   +---+-----------------------------+--------+--------------------------+ 

   |010|           VPN site ID       |reserved|FFFF|    IPv4 address     | 

   +---+-----------------------------+--------+----+---------------------+ 

   Then forward packets based on the destination site ID at this SE and 
   backbone routers. When packets reach SE at the egress, learn their 
   destination is an IPv4 site based on VPN site ID. Translate them into 
   IPv4 addresses and search the IPv4 route table of the site and then 
   forward packets into site. 

   For multicast packets entering SE, firstly detect which site they 
   come from based on the inbound interface or sub-interface, obtain the 
   VPN group ID of the site, and then translate the source address into 
   the VPN IPv4-embedded IPv6 address and translate the destination 
   address into the VPN ipv4-embedded IPv6 multicast address. The format 
   is shown as follows. 

   |   8    |  4 |  4 |      48      |     32       |      32       | 

   +--------+----+----+--------------+--------------+---------------+ 

   |11111111|1RP1|1110|    reserved  | VPN group ID | IPv4 Group    | 

   +--------+----+----+--------------+--------------+---------------+ 

   Based on this address, forward packets in the backbone network, When 
   packets reach the egress of SE, learn their destination is an IPv4 
   site based on the VPN group ID, and translate it into an IPv4 
   multicast address and then forward packets into site.

9. Security Considerations 

  9.1. Ingress Check 

   The global VPN source and destination address can only be generated 
   by SE. Prevent feigned VPN packets from entering the backbone network, 
   through only receiving those packets whose source and destination 
   addresses are VPN-local addresses, unique local IPv6 unicast 
   addresses or global Internet addresses at interfaces connecting VPN 
   sites on a SE. If source and destination addresses of packets are 
   unique local IPv6 unicast addresses, check whether the global ID in 
   the source address is legal. Other interfaces in the SE do not 
   receive such packets whose source and destination addresses are VPN-
   local addresses or unique local IPv6 unicast addresses, nor do 
   routers in backbone networks.  

  9.2. Egress Check 

   At the egress of SE, prevent the ingoing packets from being set 
   illegal source site ID. Separate VPN site ID from the source address 
   of VPN packets and check whether it and the site in the VPN 
   destination address belong to the same VPN. If not, drop this packet.  

10. IANA Considerations 

   The IANA is requested to assigned the 4000::/3 prefix to global VPN 
   unicast address and add the following note and link it to this 
   address block. 

   4000::/3              VPN Global Unicast          [IPv6 VPN]
