1.  Introduction and Overview

   This specification profiles the Identity Event Token [idevent-token]
   to define events for SCIM Protocol [RFC7644].

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  These
   keywords are capitalized when used to unambiguously specify
   requirements of the protocol or application features and behavior
   that affect the interoperability and security of implementations.
   When these words are not capitalized, they are meant in their
   natural-language sense.

   For purposes of readability examples are not URL encoded.
   Implementers MUST percent encode URLs as described in Section 2.1 of
   [RFC3986].

   Throughout this documents all figures MAY contain spaces and extra
   line-wrapping for readability and space limitations.  Similarly, some
   URI's contained within examples, have been shortened for space and
   readability reasons.

1.2.  Definitions

   This specification uses definitions from the specification
   [idevent-token].

2.  SCIM Events

   SCIM events JSON objects that are encoded in JWT form as per
   [idevent-token].  An event includes a eventUri which indicates the
   type of event and the event specific attributes.  An event also
   includes standard JWT attributes "iss", "aud", "jti", and "iat" which
   indicates the event publisher (issuer), the the event feeds
   (audience), a token identifier, and the date of issue (iat).

2.1.  Common Event Attributes

   The following attributes are defined for all events defined in
   Section 2.3 or any schema defined within the uri namespace
   "urn:ietf:params:events:SCIM".

   id
      An optional multi-valued SCIM "id" value of the affected
      resource(s) as defined in Section 3.1 [RFC7643].  If provided the
      identifiers MUST correspond to the values referenced in
      "resourceUris".

   attributes
      A multi-valued list of affected SCIM attributes.  Each attribute
      listed may be a fully-qualified attribute name or an attribute
      "path" as defined in Figure 7 of Section 3.3.2 of [RFC7644]

   values
      A JSON object structure containing the affected attributes and
      their associated values.  If the "values" attribute is supplied,
      the event message MUST be encrypted.  Service providers SHOULD
      take care to ensure that eligible subscribers are able to see
      attribute values.  Alternatively, subscribers MAY use the
      resourceURIs to retrieve the final attribute values.  When doing
      so, the SCIM service provider can then assess the subscribers
      right to obtain the actual attribute values.

      For a password change event, in maximal disclosure mode ( see
      Section 2.2), the clear text password attribute value MAY be
      included in the values"values" attribute.

2.2.  Disclosure Profiles

   SCIM events are intended to disclose the minimum amount of
   information required to provide co-ordination between asynchronous
   systems.  This has the effect of eliminating most error signaling
   conditions and simplifies privacy and security considerations.

   For each event type, the following levels of disclosure are defined,
   for which different security considerations may apply:

   Minimal
      In general, the main information content is the event description
      itself.  The event contents typically includes only REQUIRED
      attributes.  Because no data content is exchanged, encryption of
      the event message is not required.

   Default
      In general the default information is exchanged.  This includes
      the "sub" attribute and a list of affected SCIM attributes.
      Typically attribute values are not provided.  Encryption of the
      event message is typically not required unless otherwise stated.

   Maximal
      In maximal mode, all data involved in the state change is
      exchanged.  To prevent leakage of information, implementers SHOULD
      encrypt events that convey attributes about resources.  This
      profile should typically be used when co-ordinating information
      between tightly-coupled systems that are part of a common
      administrative domain.

   In the case of "minimal" and "default" disclosures, a subscriber MAY
   use a follow-up SCIM GET (see Section 3.4 [RFC7644] to obtain the
   current state of the resource (sub) following the event.  While this
   may be seen as costly (as a second call), using SCIM GET enables
   simpler error signalling, access control, distribution enforcement by
   the event publisher.

2.3.  SCIM Events

2.3.1.  urn:ietf:params:event:SCIM:add
   The specified resource URI was added to the feed.  An add does not
   indicate a resource is new or has been recently created.  For
   example, an existing user has had a new role (e.g.  CRM_User) added
   to their profile which has caused their resource to join a feed.

   The following is an example of a minimal disclosure Add Event
   message(it has been modified for readability):

}

                     Figure 1: Example SCIM Add Event

2.3.2.  urn:ietf:params:event:SCIM:create
   The new resource URI has been created at the service provider and has
   been added to the feed.  When a CREATE event is sent, a corresponding
   ADD event is not issued.  In "minimal" disclosure mode, event
   specific data is returned.  In "default" disclosure, the "attributes"
   attribute is returned disclosing what attributes were created at the
   publisher.  In "maximal" disclosure mode, set of values reflecting
   the final state of the resource at the service provider are provided
   in the "values" attribute and MUST be encrypted as a JWE (see
   [idevent-token]).

         ],
         "password":"not4u2no",
         "userName":"jdoe",
         "id":"44f6142df96bd6ab61e7521d9",
         "name":{

           "familyName":"Doe"
         }
       }
     }
   }

         Figure 2: Example SCIM Create Event (Maximal Disclosure)

   In the above example, the user "jdoe" is created with values an email
   address, an initial password, and a name.  Note that when raw data is
   sent, it is advisable to protect the event using JWE (see Section 2.2
   [idevent-token]).

   The following is an example SCIM Create event message(it has been
   modified for readability) and uses default disclosure:

   {
     "jti": "4d3559ec67504aaba65d40b0363faad8",
     "eventUris":[
       "urn:ietf:params:event:SCIM:create"
     ],
     "iat": 1458496404,
     "iss":"https://scim.example.com",
     "aud":[
      "https://scim.example.com/Feeds/98d52461fa5bbc879593b7754",
      "https://scim.example.com/Feeds/5d7604516b1d08641d7676ee7"
     ],
     "sub": "https://scim.example.com/Users/44f6142df96bd6ab61e7521d9",
     "urn:ietf:params:event:SCIM:create":{
       "attributes":["id","name","userName","password","emails"],
     }
   }

   The event above notifies the subscriber which attributes are
   available from the SCIM event publisher, but does not convey the
   actual information.  The subscriber MAY retrieve that information by
   performing a SCIM GET to the "sub" value specified.

         Figure 3: Example SCIM Create Event (Default Disclosure)

2.3.3.  urn:ietf:params:event:SCIM:activate
   The specified resource (e.g.  User) has been activated.  This
   optional event is used to indicate a high-level change in state as
   agreed between the publisher and subscriber.  For example, an
   activated resource is one that can now have an active session (may
   log in) from a security perspective (may log in).  Typically this
   event discloses only minimal information.

2.3.4.  urn:ietf:params:event:SCIM:modify
   The specified resource has been updated (e.g. one or more attributes
   has changed).  As with the create event, this event MAY be expressed
   in minimal, default, and maximal modes.

2.3.5.  urn:ietf:params:event:SCIM:deactivate
   The specified resource (e.g.  User) has been deactivated and
   disabled.  The exact meaning must be agreed to by a SCIM publisher
   and its corresponding subscriber.  Typically this means the sub may
   no longer have an active security session.  As with the activate
   event, this event has minimal disclosure requirements.

2.3.6.  urn:ietf:params:event:SCIM:delete
   The specified resource has been deleted from the SCIM publisher.  The
   resource is also removed from the feed.  When a DELETE is sent, a
   corresponding REMOVE is not issued.  A delete event has minimal
   disclosure profile only.

   The password event MAY be extended to conveys a password reset, the
   event MAY include an additional eventUri value of
   "urn:ietf:params:event:extension:example.com:password" which includes
   the attribute "resetAttempts".  "resetAttempts" indicates the current
   number of reset attempts since the last successful login by the
