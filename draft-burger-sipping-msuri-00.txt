1. Abstract 
    
   Application Servers, SIP Proxies, and SoftSwitches (a.k.a. Media 
   Gateway Controllers) act as SIP [2] User Agents to control the media 
   processing capabilities of media servers.  The SIP Request URI 
   identifies the desired service and provides a context for the media 
   server to interpret the SIP message.  This document describes a 
   standard SIP addressing mechanism to address specific services.  
   Because of SIP's flexibility, the existing protocol accommodates 
   these services.  This document proposes a standard URI scheme for 
   important media services such as announcements and conferencing.

3. Overview 
    
   Media servers are devices that perform media processing on real-time 
   packet media.  Examples of such processing are tone detection and 
   generation, packet recording (usually with transcoding), packet 
   playing (usually with transcoding û also known as prompting), and 
   mixing (also known as conferencing). 
    
   In the context of SIP control of media servers, we take advantage of 
   the fact that the standard SIP URI has a user part [2].  Media 
   servers do not have a concept of a user.  Thus we use the user 
   address, or the left-hand-side of the URI, as a service indicator. 
    
   For per-service security, the media server MAY require a per-service 
   password.  If the media server does require a per-service password, 
   the client encodes the password in the SIP URI as if it was a user

   password.  That is, the password is the right-hand side of the user 
   address part (left-hand side) of the SIP URI, separated from the 
   user address part by a colon.  This can be particularly useful for 
   password protecting service instances. 
    
   Following [2], the media server MAY issue 401 challenges for 
   authentication. 
    
   The media server, upon receiving the INVITE, notes the service 
   indicator.  Depending on the service indicator, the media server 
   will either honor the request or return a failure response code. 
 
    
4. Service Indicators 
    
   The service indicator is the concatenation of the service name and 
   an optional service instance identifier, separated by an equal sign. 
    
   Per [2], the service indicator is case insensitive.  The service 
   name MUST be from the set alphanumeric characters plus dash (US-
   ASCII %2C).  The service name MUST NOT include an equal sign (US-
   ASCII %3C). 
    
   The service name MAY have long- and short-forms, as SIP does for 
   headers. 
    
   This document reserves service names starting with "X-" or "x-" for 
   experimental or non-standard services.  Standard service indicators 
   MUST NOT begin with "X-" or "x-". 
    
   A given service indicator MAY have an associated set of parameters.  
   Such parameters MUST follow the convention set out in [2] for SIP 
   URI parameters.  That is, a semi-colon separated list of 
   keyword=values. 
    
   Certain services may have an association with a unique service 
   instance on the media server.  For example, a given media server can 
   host multiple, separate conference sessions.  To identify unique 
   service instances, a unique identifier modifies the service name.  
   The unique identifier MUST meet the rules for a legal user part of a 
   SIP URI as set out in [2].  An equal sign, US-ASCII %3D, MUST 
   separate the service indicator from the unique identifier. 
    
   Note that since the service indicator is case insensitive per [2], 
   the service instance identifier is also case insensitive. 
    
    
5. Operation 
    
   The requesting client issues a SIP INVITE to the media server, 
   specifying the requested service and any appropriate parameters.

   If the media server can perform the requested service, it does so, 
   following the processing steps described in the service definition 
   document (see IANA Considerations, below). 
    
   If the media server cannot perform the requested service or does not 
   recognize the service indicator, it MUST respond with the response 
   code 488 NOT ACCEPTABLE HERE.  This is appropriate, as 488 refers to 
   a problem with the user part of the URI.  Moreover, 608 is not 
   appropriate, as some other media server may be able to satisfy the 
   request.  [4] describes the 488 and 608 response codes. 
    
   Some services require a unique identifier.  Most services 
   automatically create a service instance upon the first INVITE with 
   the given identifier.  However, if a service requires an existing 
   service instance, and no such service instance exists on the media 
   server, the media server MUST respond with the response code 404 NOT 
   FOUND.  This is appropriate as the service itself exists on the 
   media server, but the particular service instance does not.  It is 
   as if the user was not home.  
     
    
6. Formal Syntax 
    
   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur 
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC-2234 [5]. 
 
   SERVICE-URL     = "sip:" srvc-ind "@" hostport 
                          url-parameters [headers] 
    
   srvc-ind        = srvc [ ":" password ] 
    
   srvc            = srvc-name [ "=" instanceId ]  
    
   srvc-name       = "annc" | "conf" | token | x-token 
    
   x-token         = ( "X-" | "x-" ) token 
    
   instanceId      = token 
    
   Section 2 of [2] defines the elements password, hostport, and token.  
   See the IANA Considerations section for procedures for adding new 
   service indicators. 
    
    
7. Security Considerations 
 
   The security issues are the same as for SIP [4], as the media server 
   is simply a SIP User Agent.

8. IANA Considerations 
    
   This document describes an extensible set of SIP Media Server 
   Service Indicator types.  To promote interoperability and coherent 
   interpretations of different types, we need a central repository for 
   well-known service indicator types. 
    
   IANA will create a repository for service indicator types called 
   "SIP Media Server Service Indicator Types".  Following the policies 
   outlined in [6], this repository is "Specification Required by RFC."  
   The documents [7] and [9] describe the initial values for the 
   repository.  For reference, the values are as follows. 
    
   NOTE: We already have another indicator type for transcoding, but 
   the draft isn't baked yet.

   These examples are informative.  For the normative definitions of 
   the given services, see the referenced documents. 
    
   NOTE: The line wrapping (backslash, CRLF, and spacing before 
   continued lines) in the examples is for readability purposes only. 
    
    
9.1. Announcement 
    
   The document [7] fully specifies the announcement service.  In 
   brief, the announcement service can play a prompt as early media or 
   after the establishment of a connection. 
    
   The announcement service indicator is "annc".  The parameters are 
   "play" which specifies an audio resource and "early" which specifies 
   whether to play the announcement as early media or after connection 
   establishment.

   In the following example, the media server at ms2.carrier.net 
   retrieves an audio file using HTTP [8] from the server 
   prompts.carrier.net and plays it as early media. 
    
        sip:annc@ms2.carrier.net; \ 
          play=http://prompts.carrier.net/audio/allcircuitsbusy.g711; \ 
          early=yes 
    
    
9.2. Conference 
    
   The document [9] fully specifies the conference service.  In brief, 
   the conference service creates a conference upon the first instance 
   of a unique service instance identifier.  The media server places 
   subsequent requests with the same service instance identifier into a 
   conference. 
    
   The conference service indicator is "conf".  There are no parameters 
   for the conference service. 
    
   In the following example, the media server at ms2.carrier.net 
   creates (or places into conference) the stream associated with the 
   SDP in the INVITE to the conference identified by the identifier 
   "q4unfcqdscQS". 
    
        sip:conf=q4unfcqdscQS@ms2.carrier.net
