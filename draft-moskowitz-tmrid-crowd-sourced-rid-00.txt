               draft-moskowitz-tmrid-crowd-sourced-rid-00

Abstract

   This document describes using the ASTM Broadcast Remote ID (B-RID)
   specification in a "crowd sourced" smart phone environment to provide
   much of the FAA mandated Network Remote ID (N-RID) functionality.
   This crowd sourced B-RID data will use multi-lateration to add a
   level of reliability in the location data on the Unmanned Aircraft
   (UA).

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a mechanism to capture the ASTM Broadcast
   Remote ID messages (B-RID) [WK65041] on any Internet connected device
   that receives them and can forward them to the SPDP(s) responsible
   for the geographic area the UA and receivers are in.  This will
   create a ecosystem that will meet most if not all data collection
   requriments that CAAs are placing on Network Remote ID (N-RID).

   These Internet connected devices are herein called "Finders", as they
   find UAs by listening for B-RID messages.  The Finders are B-RID
   forwarding proxies.  Their potentially limited spacial view of RID
   messages could result in bad decisions on what messages to send to
   the SPDP and which to drop.  The SPDP will make any filtering
   decisions in what it forwards to the UTM(s).

   Finders can be smartphones, tablets, or any computing platform with
   Internet connectivity that can meet the requirements defined in this
   document.  It is not expected, nor necessary, that Finders have any
   information about a UAS beyond the content in the B-RID messages.

Internet-Draft                   CS-RID                    February 2020


   Finders MAY only need a loose association with the SPDP(s).  They may
   only have the SPDP's Public Key and FQDN.  It would use these, along
   with the Finder's Public Key to use ECIES, or other security methods,
   to send the messages in a secure manner to the SPDP.  The SPDP MAY
   require a stronger relationship to the Finders.  This may range from
   the Finder's Public Key being registered to the SPDP with other
   information so that the SPDP has some level of trust in the Finders
   to requiring transmissions be sent over long-lived transport
   connections like ESP or DTLS.

   This document has minimal information about the actions of SPDPs.  In
   general the SPDP is out of scope of this document.  That said, the
   SPDPs should not simply proxy B-RID messages to the UTM(s).  They
   should perform some minimal level of filtering and content checking
   before forwarding those messages that pass these tests in a secure
   manner to the UTM(s).

   An SPDP SHOULD only forward Authenticated B-RID messages like those
   defined in [tmrid-auth] to the UTM(s).  Further, the SPDP SHOULD
   validate the Remote ID (RID) and the Authentication signature before
   forwarding anything from the UA.

   When 3 or more Finders are reporting to an SPDP on a specific UA, the
   SPDP is in a unique position to perform multilateration on these
   messages and compute the Finder's view of the UA location to compare
   with the UA Location/Vector messages.  This check against the UA's
   location claims is both a validation on the UA's reliability as well
   as the trustworthiness of the Finders.  Other than providing data to
   allow for multilateration, this SPDP feature is out of scope of this
   document.

2.2.  Definitions

   B-RID
      Broadcast Remote ID.  A method of sending RID messages as 1-way
      transmissions from the UA to any Observers within radio range.

   CAA
      Civil Aeronautics Administration.  An example is the Federal
      Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States of America.

   ECIES
      Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme.  A hybrid encryption
      scheme which provides semantic security against an adversary who
      is allowed to use chosen-plaintext and chosen-ciphertext attacks.

   GCS
      Ground Control Station.  The part of the UAS that the remote pilot
      uses to exercise C2 over the UA, whether by remotely exercising UA
      flight controls to fly the UA, by setting GPS waypoints, or
      otherwise directing its flight.

   Finder
      In Internet connected device that can receive B-RID messages and
      forward them to a UTM.

   Observer
      Referred to in other UAS documents as a "user", but there are also
      other classes of RID users, so we prefer "observer" to denote an
      individual who has observed an UA and wishes to know something
      about it, starting with its RID.

   Multilateration
      Multilateration (more completely, pseudo range multilateration) is
      a navigation and surveillance technique based on measurement of
      the times of arrival (TOAs) of energy waves (radio, acoustic,
      seismic, etc.) having a known propagation speed.

   NETSP
      Network RID Service Provider.  USS receiving Network RID messages
      from UAS (UA or GCS), storing for a short specified time, making
      available to NETDP.

   NETDP
      Network RID Display Provider.  Entity (might be USS) aggregating
      data from multiple NETSPs to answer query from observer (or other
      party) desiring Situational Awareness of UAS operating in a
      specific airspace volume.

      Internet connection of the UAS directly to the UTM.

   RID
      Remote ID.  A unique identifier found on all UA to be used in
      communication and in regulation of UA operation.

   SDSP
      Supplemental Data Service Provider.  Entity providing information
      that is allowed, but not required to be present in the UTM system.

   UA
      Unmanned Aircraft.  In this document UA's are typically though of
      as drones of commerical or military variety.  This is a very
      strict definition which can be relaxed to include any and all
      aircraft that are unmanned.

   UAS
      Unmanned Aircraft System.  Composed of Unmanned Aircraft and all
      required on-board subsystems, payload, control station, other
      required off-board subsystems, any required launch and recovery
      equipment, all required crew members, and C2 links between UA and
      the control station.

   UTM
      UAS Traffic Management.  A "traffic management" ecosystem for
      uncontrolled operations that is separate from, but complementary
      to, the FAA's Air Traffic Management (ATM) system.

   USS
      UAS Service Supplier.  Provide UTM services to support the UAS
      community, to connect Operators and other entities to enable
      information flow across the USS network, and to promote shared
      situational awareness among UTM participants.  (From FAA UTM
      ConOps V1, May 2018).

3.  Problem Space

3.1.  Meeting the needs of Network ID

   The Federal (US) Aviation Authority (FAA), in the December 31, 2019
   Remote ID Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), is requiring
   "Standard" and "Limited" Remote ID.  Standard is when the UAS
   provides both Network and Broadcast RID.  Limited is when the UAS
   provides only Network RID.  The FAA has dropped their previous
   position on allowing for only Broadcast RID.  We can guess as to
   their reasons; they are not spelled out in the NPRM.  It may be that



Moskowitz, et al.        Expires 31 August 2020                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                   CS-RID                    February 2020


   just B-RID does not meet the FAA's statutory UA tracking
   responsibility.

   The UAS vendors have commented that N-RID places considerable demands
   on currently used UAS.  For some UAS like RC planes, meaningful N-RID
   (via the Pilot's smartphone) are of limited value.  A mechanism that
   can augment B-RID to provide N-RID would help all members of the UAS
   environment to provide safe operation and allow for new applications.

3.2.  Trustworthiness of Proxied Data

   When a proxy is introduced in any communication protocol, there is a
   risk of corrupted data and DOS attacks.

3.3.  Defense against fraudulent RID Messages

   TBD

   TBD

4.  The Finder - SPDP Security Relationship

   The SPDP(s) and Finders SHOULD use EDDSA keys as their trusted
   Identities.  The public keys SHOULD be registered Hierarchical HITS,
   [hierarchical-hit] and [hhit-registries].

   The SPDP uses some process (out of scope here) to register the
   Finders and there EDDSA Public Key.  During this registration, the
   Finder gets the SPDP's EDDSA Public Key.  These Public Keys allow for
   the following options for authenticated messaging from the Finder to
   the SPDP.

   1.  ECIES can be used with a unique nonce to authenticate each
       message sent from a Finder to the SPDP.

   2.  ECIES can be used at the start of some period (e.g. day) to
       establish a shared secret that is then used to authenticate each
       message sent from a Finder to the SPDP sent during that period.

   3.  HIPv2 [RFC7401] can be used to establish a session secret that is
       then used with ESP [RFC4303] to authenticate each message sent
       from a Finder to the SPDP.

   4.  DTLS [RFC5238] can be used to establish a secure connection that
       is then used to authenticate each message sent from a Finder to
       the SPDP.

5.  The CS-RID datagram

   The Finders add their own information to the RID messages, permitting
   the SPDP(s) to gain additional knowledge about the UA(s).  The RID
   information is the RID message content plus the MAC address.  The MAC
   address is critical, as it is the only field that links a UA's RID
   messages together.  Only the ASTM Basic ID Message and possibly the
   Authentication Message contain the UAS ID field.

   The Finders add an SPDP assigned ID, a 64 bit timestamp, and GPS
   information, and type of B-RID media.  Both the timestamp and GPS
   information are for when the RID message(s) were received, not
   forwarded to the SPDP.  All this content is MACed using a key shared
   between the Finder and SPDP.

   CS-RID information is represented in CBOR [RFC7049].  COSE [RFC8152]
   may be used for CS-RID signing and COAP [RFC7252] for the CS-RID
   protocol.

5.1.  The CS-RID message content

   The following is a representation of the content in the CS-RID
   messages.

            (   CS-RID MESSAGE TYPE,
                CS-RID ID,
                RECEIVE TIMESTAMP,
                RECEIVE GPS,
                RECEIVE RADIO TYPE,
                B-RID MAC ADDRESS,
                B-RID MESSAGE,
                CS-RID MAC)


   TBD

5.1.1.  CS-RID MESSAGE TYPE

   The CS-RID MESSAGE TYPE is:

   Number   CS-RID Message Type
   ------   -----------------
   0        Reserved
   1        B-RID Forwarding

5.1.2.  CS-RID ID

   The CS-RID ID is the ID recognized by the SPDP.  This may be an HHIT
   Hierarchical HITs [hierarchical-hit], or any ID used by the SPDP.
