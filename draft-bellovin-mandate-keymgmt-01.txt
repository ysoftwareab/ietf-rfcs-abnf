Abstract

   The question often arises of whether or not a given security system
   requires some form of automated key management, or whether manual
   keying is sufficient.  This memo proposes guidelines for making such
   decisions.  The presumption is that when symmetric cryptographic
   mechanisms are used in a protocol, then automated key management is
   generally but not always needed.  If manual keying is proposed, the
   burden of proving that automated key management is not required falls
   to the proposer.

1. Introduction

   The question often arises of whether or not a given security system
   requires some form of automated key management, or whether manual
   keying is sufficient.

   There is not one answer to that question; circumstances differ.  In
   general, automated key management SHOULD be used.  Occasionally,
   relying on manual key management is reasonable; we propose some
   guidelines for making that judgment.

   On the other hand, relying on manual key management has significant
   disadvantages, and we outline the security concerns that justify the
   preference for automated key management.  Yet, there are situations
   where manual key management is acceptable.


1.1. Terminology

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [STDWORDS].


2. Guidelines

   These guidelines are for use by IETF working group and protocol
   authors Who are determining whether to mandate automated key
   management and whether manual key management is acceptable.  Informed
   judgment is needed.

   The term "key management" is the establishment of cryptographic
   keying material for use with a cryptographic algorithm to provide
   protocol security services, especially integrity, authentication, and
   confidentiality. Automated key management derives one or more short-
   term session key.  The key derivation function may make use of long-
   term keys to incorporate authentication into the process.  The manner
   in which this long-term key is distributed to the peers and the type
   of key used (pre-shared symmetric secret value, RSA public key, DSA
   public key, and others) is beyond the scope of this document.
   However, it is part of the overall key management solution.  Manual
   key management is used to distribute such values.  Manual key
   management can also be used to distribute long-term session keys.

   Automated key management and manual key management provide very
   different features.  In particular, the protocol associated with an
   automated key management technique will confirm liveness of the peer,
   authenticate the source of the short-term session key, associate

   protocol state information with the short-term session key, and
   ensure that a fresh short-term session key is generated.  Further,
   the protocol associated with automated key management can improve
   interoperability by including mechanisms for the negotiation of
   cryptographic algorithms.  None of these valuable features is
   possible with manual key management, and it is not possible to
   provide protection against replay without automated key management.

   Implementations of some symmetric cryptographic algorithms
   implementation are required to prevent the overuse of each key.  An
   implementation of such algorithms can make use of automated key
   management when the usage limits are nearly exhausted to establish
   replacement keys before the limits are reached, thereby maintaining
   secure communications.

   Examples of automated key management systems include IPsec IKE and
   Kerberos.  S/MIME and TLS also include automated key management
   functions.

   Key management schemes should not be designed by amateurs; it is
   almost certainly inappropriate for working groups to design their
   own.  To put it in concrete terms, the very first key management
   protocol in the open literature was published in 1978 [NS].  A flaw
   and a fix were published in 1981 [DS];  it was cracked in 1994 [AN].
   In 1995 [L], a new flaw was found in the original 1978 version, in an
   area not affected by the 1981/1994 issue.  All of these flaws were
   blindingly obvious once described -- but no one spotted them earlier.
   Note that the original protocol (translated to know about
   certificates, which had not been invented at that time) was only
   three messages.

   Key management software is not always large or bloated; even IKEv1
   [IKEv1] can be done in less than 200K, and TLS [TLS] in half that
   space.  (Note that this TLS estimate includes other functionality as
   well.)

   A session key is used to protect a payload.  The nature of the
   payload depends on the layer where the symmetric cryptography is
   applied.

   In general, automated key management SHOULD be used to establish
   session keys.  This is a very strong "SHOULD", meaning the
   justification is needed in the security considerations section of a
   proposal that makes use of manual key management.

2.1. Automated Key Management

   Automated key management MUST be used if any of these conditions
   hold:

        A central party will have to manage n^2 static keys, where n may
        become large.

        Any stream cipher (such as RC4 [RC4], AES-CTR [AESMODES], or
        AES-CCM [AESCCM]) is used.

        An initialization vector (IV) might be reused, especially an
        implicit IV.  (Note that random or pseudo-random explicit IVs
        are not a problem unless the probability of repetition is high.)

        Large amounts of data might need to be encrypted in a short
        time, causing frequent change of the short-term session key.

        Long-term session keys are used by more than two parties.
        (Multicast is a necessary exception, but multicast key
        management standards are emerging so that this can be avoided in
        the future.  Sharing long-term session keys should generally be
        discouraged.)

        The likely operational environment is one where personnel (or
        device) turnover is frequent, causing frequent change of the
        short-term session key.


2.2. Manual Key Management

   Manual key management is a reasonable approach in any of these
   situations:

        The environment has very limited available bandwidth or very
        high round-trip times.  Public key systems tend to require long
        messages and lots of computation; symmetric key alternatives,
        such as Kerberos, often require several round trips and
        interaction with third parties.

        The information being protected has low value.

        The total volume of traffic over the entire lifetime of the
        long-term session key will be very low.

        The scale of each deployment is very limited.

   Note that assertions about such things should often be viewed with



Bellovin & Housley                                              [Page 4]

Internet Draft    draft-bellovin-mandate-keymgmt-01.txt      August 2004


   the skepticism.  The burden of demonstrating that manual key
   management is appropriate falls to the proponents -- and it is a
   fairly high hurdle.

   Systems that employ manual key management need provisions for key
   changes.  There MUST be some way to indicate which key is in use, to
   avoid problems during transition.  Designs SHOULD sketch plausible
   mechanisms for deploying new keys and replacing old ones, which might
   be compromised.  If done well, such mechanisms can later be used by
   an add-on key management scheme.

   Lack of clarity about who the principals are is not a valid reason
   for avoiding key management.  Rather, it tends to indicate a deeper
   problem with the underlying security model.


2.3. Key Size and Random Values

   Guidance on cryptographic key size for public keys used for
   exchanging symmetric keys can be found in BCP 86 [KEYSIZE].

   When manual key management is used, long-term shared secret values
   SHOULD be at least 128 bits.

   Guidance on the generation of random number generattion can be found
   in RFC 1750 [RANDOM].

   When manual key management is used, long-term shared secret values
   MUST be unpredictable "random" value, ensuring that an adversary will
   have no greater expectation than 50% of finding the value after
   searching through half the search space.


3. Security Considerations

   This document provides guidance to working groups and protocol
   designers, and the security if the Internet is improved when
   automated key management is empolyed.

   The inclusion of automated key management does not mean that an
   interface for manual key management is prohibited.  In fact, manual
   key management is very helpful for debugging, so implementations
   ought to provide a manual key management interface for such purposes,
   even if they are not specified by the protocol.
