             LDAP Schema for supporting XMPP in White Pages
                    draft-kille-ldap-xmpp-schema-01

Abstract

   The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) identifies
   users by use of JID (Jabber IDs).  Lightweight Directory Access
   Protocol (LDAP) enables provision of a white pages service with
   schema relating to users and support for internet protocols.  This
   specification defines schema to enable XMPP JIDs to be associated
   with objects in an LDAP directory so that this information can be
   used with white pages applications.

1.  Introduction

   Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [RFC6120]
   identifies users by use of JID (Jabber IDs).  Lightweight Directory
   Access Protocol (LDAP) [RFC4510] enables provision of a white pages
   service with schema relating to users and support for internet
   protocols defined in [RFC4519].  This specification defines schema to
   enable XMPP JIDs to be associated with LDAP directory objects so that
   this information can be used with white pages applications.

   The LDAP schema for storing JIDs is defined to enable JIDs to be
   associated with any object stored in the directory.  This is done by
   associating the new JID Attribute with a new Auxiliary Object Class
   (JIDObject).

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Schema Definition

   This section defines the schema used to store JIDs in the directory.

3.1.  Object Class

   This section defines a new Auxiliary Object Class (JIDObject) which
   may be associated with any primary Object Class.

Internet-Draft            LDAP Schema for XMPP                  May 2017


       ( TBA.1 NAME 'JIDObject'
        AUXILIARY
        MAY jid )

3.2.  Attribute

   This section defines the JID attribute referenced by the
   ObjectWithJID Auxiliary Object Class.  The syntax of the JID
   attribute MUST follow the rules of [RFC7622].  The JID stored MUST be
   a bare JID and not a full JID.  Note that the LDAP directory server
   is NOT expected to enforce this syntax.  The syntax rules are for
   LDAP clients setting this attribute.

         ( TBA.2 NAME 'jid'
            EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
            SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
            SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 )

   1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 refers to the Directory String syntax
   defined in [RFC4517].

4.  IANA Considerations

   The two Object Identifiers, references as TBA.1 and TBA.2 in this
   draft are assigned by IANA in the "Object Identifier Descriptors" as
   the name of the LDAP Registry <https://www.iana.org/assignments/ldap-
   parameters/ldap-parameters.xhtml>.

5.  Security Considerations

   This schema enables publishing for XMPP JIDs, and care should be
   taken to ensure that this information is not accessed
   inappropriately.
