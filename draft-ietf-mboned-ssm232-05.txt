   IP Multicast group addresses in the 232/8 (232.0.0.0 to
   232.255.255.255) range are designated as source-specific multicast
   [SSM] destination addresses and are reserved for use by source-
   specific applications and protocols [IANA]. This document defines
   operational recommendations to ensure source-specific behavior within
   the 232/8 range.

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, MAY, OPTIONAL, REQUIRED, RECOMMENDED,
   SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT are to be interpreted as defined
   in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.  Introduction


   Current PIM Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) [RFC2362] relies on the shared
   Rendezvous Point (RP) tree to learn about active sources for a group
   and to support group-generic (not source specific) data distribution.
   The IP Multicast group address range 232/8 has been designated for
   source-specific [SSM] applications and protocols [IANA] and SHOULD
   support source-only trees only, precluding the requirement of an RP
   and a shared tree; active sources in the 232/8 range will be
   discovered out of band. PIM Sparse Mode Designated Routers (DR), with
   local membership, are capable of joining the shortest path tree for
   the source directly using Source-Specific PIM [SSM].

   Operational best common practices in the 232/8 group address range
   are necessary to ensure shortest path source-only trees across
   multiple domains in the Internet [SSM], and to prevent data from
   sources sending to groups in the 232/8 range from arriving via shared
   trees. This avoids unwanted data arrival, and allows several sources
   to use the same group address without conflict at the receivers.

   The operational practices SHOULD

    o Prevent local sources from sending to shared tree

    o Prevent remote sources from being learned/joined via MSDP [MSDP]

    o Prevent receivers from joining the shared tree

    o Prevent RP's as candidates for 232/8




2.  Operational practices in 232/8




2.1.  Preventing local sources from sending to shared tree


   Eliminating the use of shared trees for groups in 232/8, while
   maintaining coexistence with PIM-SM, behavior of the RP and/or the DR
   needs to be modified. This can be accomplished by

    - preventing data for 232/8 groups from being sent encapsulated to
      the RP by the DR

    - preventing the RP from accepting registers for 232/8 groups from
      the DR

    - preventing the RP from forwarding accepted data down (*,G)
      tree for 232/8 groups




2.2.  Preventing remote sources from being learned/joined via MSDP


   PIM-SS does not require active source announcements via MSDP. All
   source announcements are received out of band, the the last hop
   router is responsible for sending (S,G) joins directly to the source.
   To prevent propagation of SAs in the 232/8 range, an RP SHOULD

    - never originate an SA for any 232/8 groups

    - never accept or forward an SA for any 232/8 groups.

2.3.  Preventing receivers from joining the shared tree


   Local PIM domain practices need to be enforced to prevent local
   receivers from joining the shared tree for 232/8 groups. This can be
   accomplished by

    - preventing DR from sending (*,G) joins for 232/8 groups

    - preventing RP from accepting (*,G) join for 232/8 groups

   However, within a local PIM domain, any last-hop router NOT
   preventing (*,G) joins may trigger unwanted (*,G) state toward
   the RP which intersects an existing (S,G) tree, allowing the
   receiver on the shared tree to receive the data, breaking the
   source-specific [SSM] service model. It is therefore recommended
   that ALL routers in the domain MUST reject AND never originate
   (*,G) joins for 232/8 groups.

   In those cases in which an ISP is offering its customers (or
   others) the use of the ISP's RP, the ISP SHOULD NOT allow (*,G)
   joins in the 232/8 range.




2.4.  Preventing RP's as candidates for 232/8


   Because PIM-SS does not require an RP, all RPs SHOULD NOT offer
   themselves as candidates in the 232/8 range. This can be accomplished
   by

    - preventing RP/BSR from announcing in the 232/8 range

    - preventing ALL routers from accepting RP delegations in the
      232/8 range

    - precluding RP functionality on RP for the 232/8 range
