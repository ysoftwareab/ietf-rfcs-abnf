Abstract

   This note describes a digital signature system based on cryptographic
   hash functions, following the seminal work in this area of Lamport,
   Diffie, Winternitz, and Merkle, as adapted by Leighton and Micali in
   1995.  It specifies a one-time signature scheme and a general
   signature scheme.  These systems provide asymmetric authentication
   without using large integer mathematics and can achieve a high
   security level.  They are suitable for compact implementations, are
   relatively simple to implement, and naturally resist side-channel
   attacks.  Unlike most other signature systems, hash-based signatures
   would still be secure even if it proves feasible for an attacker to
   build a quantum computer.

1.  Introduction

   One-time signature systems, and general purpose signature systems
   built out of one-time signature systems, have been known since 1979
   [Merkle79], were well studied in the 1990s [USPTO5432852], and have
   benefited from renewed attention in the last decade.  The
   characteristics of these signature systems are small private and
   public keys and fast signature generation and verification, but large
   signatures and moderately slow key generation (in comparison with RSA
   and ECDSA).  Private keys can be made very small by appropriate key
   generation, for example, as described in Appendix A.  In recent years
   there has been interest in these systems because of their post-
   quantum security and their suitability for compact verifier
   implementations.

   This note describes the Leighton and Micali adaptation [USPTO5432852]
   of the original Lamport-Diffie-Winternitz-Merkle one-time signature
   system [Merkle79] [C:Merkle87][C:Merkle89a][C:Merkle89b] and general
   signature system [Merkle79] with enough specificity to ensure
   interoperability between implementations.

   A signature system provides asymmetric message authentication.  The
   key generation algorithm produces a public/private key pair.  A
   message is signed by a private key, producing a signature, and a
   message/signature pair can be verified by a public key.  A One-Time
   Signature (OTS) system can be used to sign one message securely, but
   will become insecure if more than one is signed with the same public/
   private key pair.  An N-time signature system can be used to sign N
   or fewer messages securely.  A Merkle tree signature scheme is an
   N-time signature system that uses an OTS system as a component.

Internet-Draft            Hash-Based Signatures               March 2018


   In this note we describe the Leighton-Micali Signature (LMS) system,
   which is a variant of the Merkle scheme, and a Hierarchical Signature
   System (HSS) built on top of it that can efficiently scale to larger
   numbers of signatures.  We denote the one-time signature scheme
   incorporated in LMS as LM-OTS.  This note is structured as follows.
   Notation is introduced in Section 3.  The LM-OTS signature system is
   described in Section 4, and the LMS and HSS N-time signature systems
   are described in Section 5 and Section 6, respectively.  Sufficient
   detail is provided to ensure interoperability.  The public formats
   are described in Section 7.  The rationale for design decisions are
   given in Section 8.  The changes made to this document over previous
   versions is listed in Section 9.  The IANA registry for these
   signature systems is described in Section 10.  Intellectual Property
   issues are discussed in Section 11.  Security considerations are
   presented in Section 12.

1.1.  Conventions Used In This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Interface

   The LMS signing algorithm is stateful; it modifies and updates the
   private key as a side effect of generating a signature.  Once a
   particular value of the private key is used to sign one message, it
   MUST NOT be used to sign another.

      The key generation algorithm takes as input an indication of the
      parameters for the signature system.  If it is successful, it
      returns both a private key and a public key.  Otherwise, it
      returns an indication of failure.

      The signing algorithm takes as input the message to be signed and
      the current value of the private key.  If successful, it returns a
      signature and the next value of the private key, if there is such
      a value.  After the private key of an N-time signature system has
      signed N messages, the signing algorithm returns the signature and
      an indication that there is no next value of the private key that
      can be used for signing.  If unsuccessful, it returns an
      indication of failure.

      The verification algorithm takes as input the public key, a
      message, and a signature, and returns an indication of whether or
      not the signature and message pair is valid.

   A message/signature pair is valid if the signature was returned by
   the signing algorithm upon input of the message and the private key
   corresponding to the public key; otherwise, the signature and message
   pair is not valid with probability very close to one.

3.  Notation

3.1.  Data Types

   Bytes and byte strings are the fundamental data types.  A single byte
   is denoted as a pair of hexadecimal digits with a leading "0x".  A
   byte string is an ordered sequence of zero or more bytes and is
   denoted as an ordered sequence of hexadecimal characters with a
   leading "0x".  For example, 0xe534f0 is a byte string with a length
   of three.  An array of byte strings is an ordered set, indexed
   starting at zero, in which all strings have the same length.

   Unsigned integers are converted into byte strings by representing
   them in network byte order.  To make the number of bytes in the
   representation explicit, we define the functions u8str(X), u16str(X),
   and u32str(X), which take a non-negative integer X as input and
   return one, two, and four byte strings, respectively.  We also make
   use of the function strTou32(S), which takes a four-byte string S as
   input and returns a non-negative integer; the identity
   u32str(strTou32(S)) = S holds for any four-byte string S.

3.1.1.  Operators

   When a and b are real numbers, mathematical operators are defined as
   follows:

      ^ : a ^ b denotes the result of a raised to the power of b

      * : a * b denotes the product of a multiplied by b

      / : a / b denotes the quotient of a divided by b

      % : a % b denotes the remainder of the integer division of a by b

      + : a + b denotes the sum of a and b

      - : a - b denotes the difference of a and b

   The standard order of operations is used when evaluating arithmetic
   expressions.

Internet-Draft            Hash-Based Signatures               March 2018


   When B is a byte and i is an integer, then B >> i denotes the logical
   right-shift operation by i positions.  Similarly, B << i denotes the
   logical left-shift operation.

   If S and T are byte strings, then S || T denotes the concatenation of
   S and T.  If S and T are equal length byte strings, then S AND T
   denotes the bitwise logical and operation.

   The i-th element in an array A is denoted as A[i].

3.1.2.  Functions

   If r is a non-negative real number, then we define the following
   functions:

      ceil(r) : returns the smallest integer larger than r

      floor(r) : returns the largest integer smaller than r

      lg(r) : returns the base-2 logarithm of r

3.1.3.  Strings of w-bit elements

   If S is a byte string, then byte(S, i) denotes its i-th byte, where
   byte(S, 0) is the leftmost byte.  In addition, bytes(S, i, j) denotes
   the range of bytes from the i-th to the j-th byte, inclusive.  For
   example, if S = 0x02040608, then byte(S, 0) is 0x02 and bytes(S, 1,
   2) is 0x0406.

   A byte string can be considered to be a string of w-bit unsigned
   integers; the correspondence is defined by the function coef(S, i, w)
   as follows:

   If S is a string, i is a positive integer, and w is a member of the
   set { 1, 2, 4, 8 }, then coef(S, i, w) is the i-th, w-bit value, if S
   is interpreted as a sequence of w-bit values.  That is,

       coef(S, i, w) = (2^w - 1) AND
                       ( byte(S, floor(i * w / 8)) >>
                         (8 - (w * (i % (8 / w)) + w)) )

Internet-Draft            Hash-Based Signatures               March 2018


   For example, if S is the string 0x1234, then coef(S, 7, 1) is 0 and
   coef(S, 0, 4) is 1.


                      S (represented as bits)
         +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
         | 0| 0| 0| 1| 0| 0| 1| 0| 0| 0| 1| 1| 0| 1| 0| 0|
         +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
                                ^
                                |
                          coef(S, 7, 1)


                 S (represented as four-bit values)
         +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
         |     1     |     2     |     3     |     4     |
         +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
               ^
               |
         coef(S, 0, 4)

   The return value of coef is an unsigned integer.  If i is larger than
   the number of w-bit values in S, then coef(S, i, w) is undefined, and
   an attempt to compute that value should raise an error.

3.2.  Security string

   To improve security against attacks that amortize their effort
   against multiple invocations of the hash function, Leighton and
   Micali introduce a "security string" that is distinct for each
   invocation of that function.  Whenever this process computes a hash,
   the string being hashed will start with a string formed from the
   below fields.  These fields will appear in fixed locations in the
   value we compute the hash of, and so we list where in the hash these
   fields would be present.  These fields are:

      I - a 16-byte identifier for the LMS public/private key pair.  It
      MUST be chosen uniformly at random, or via a pseudorandom process,
      at the time that a key pair is generated, in order to minimize the
      probability that any specific value of I be used for a large
      number of different LMS private keys.  This is always bytes 0-15
      of the hash.

      r - in the LMS N-time signature scheme, the node number r
      associated with a particular node of a hash tree is used as an
      input to the hash used to compute that node.  This value is
      represented as a 32-bit (four byte) unsigned integer in network

      byte order.  Either r or q (depending on the domain separation
      parameter) will be bytes 16-19 of the hash.

      q - in the LMS N-time signature scheme, each LM-OTS signature is
      associated with the leaf of a hash tree, and q is set to the leaf
      number.  This ensures that a distinct value of q is used for each
      distinct LM-OTS public/private key pair.  This value is
      represented as a 32-bit (four byte) unsigned integer in network
      byte order.  Either r or q (depending on the domain separation
      parameter) will be bytes 16-19 of the hash.

      D - a domain separation parameter, which is a two byte identifier
      that takes on different values in the different contexts in which
      the hash function is invoked.  D occurs in bytes 20, 21 of the
      hash, and takes on the following values:

         D_PBLC = 0x8080 when computing the hash of all of the iterates
         in the LM-OTS algorithm

         D_MESG = 0x8181 when computing the hash of the message in the
         LM-OTS algorithms

         D_LEAF = 0x8282 when computing the hash of the leaf of an LMS
         tree

         D_INTR = 0x8383 when computing the hash of an interior node of
         an LMS tree

         i - a value between 0 and 264; this is used in the LM-OTS
         scheme, when either computing the iterations of the Winternitz
         chain, or when using the suggested LM-OTS private key
         generation process.  It is represented as a 16-bit (two-byte)
         unsigned integer in network byte order.

      j - in the LM-OTS scheme, j is the iteration number used when the
      private key element is being iteratively hashed.  It is
      represented as an 8-bit (one byte) unsigned integer and is present
      if D is a value between 0 and 264.  If present, it occurs at byte
      22 of the hash.

      C - an n-byte randomizer that is included with the message
      whenever it is being hashed to improve security.  C MUST be chosen
      uniformly at random, or via a pseudorandom process.  It is present
      if D=D_MESG, and it occurs at bytes 22 to 21+n of the hash.

3.3.  Typecodes

   A typecode is an unsigned integer that is associated with a
   particular data format.  The format of the LM-OTS, LMS, and HSS
   signatures and public keys all begin with a typecode that indicates
   the precise details used in that format.  These typecodes are
   represented as four-byte unsigned integers in network byte order;
   equivalently, they are XDR enumerations (see Section 7).

4.  LM-OTS One-Time Signatures

   This section defines LM-OTS signatures.  The signature is used to
   validate the authenticity of a message by associating a secret
   private key with a shared public key.  These are one-time signatures;
   each private key MUST be used at most one time to sign any given
   message.

   As part of the signing process, a digest of the original message is
   computed using the cryptographic hash function H (see Section 4.1),
   and the resulting digest is signed.

   In order to facilitate its use in an N-time signature system, the LM-
   OTS key generation, signing, and verification algorithms all take as
   input a diversification parameter q (which is used as part of the
   security string, as listed in Section 3.2).  When the LM-OTS
   signature system is used outside of an N-time signature system, this
   value SHOULD be set to the all-zero value.

4.1.  Parameters

   The signature system uses the parameters n and w, which are both
   positive integers.  The algorithm description also makes use of the
   internal parameters p and ls, which are dependent on n and w.  These
   parameters are summarized as follows:

      n : the number of bytes of the output of the hash function

      w : the width (in bits) of the Winternitz coefficients; it is a

   For more background on the cryptographic security requirements on H,
   see the Section 12.

   The value of n is determined by the hash function selected for use as
   part of the LM-OTS algorithm; the choice of this value has a strong
   effect on the security of the system.  The parameter w determines the
   length of the Winternitz chains computed as a part of the OTS
   signature (which involve 2^w-1 invocations of the hash function); it
   has little effect on security.  Increasing w will shorten the
   signature, but at a cost of a larger computation to generate and
   verify a signature.  The values of p and ls are dependent on the
   choices of the parameters n and w, as described in Appendix B.  A
   table illustrating various combinations of n, w, p, and ls is
   provided in Table 1.

4.2.  Parameter Sets

   To fully describe a LM-OTS signature method, the parameters n and w,
   as well as the function H, MUST be specified.  This section defines
   several LM-OTS methods, each of which is identified by a name.  The
   values for p and ls are provided as a convenience; the formal method
   of computing them is given in Appendix B.

   The value of w describes a space/time trade-off; increasing the value
   of w will cause the signature to shrink (by decreasing the value of
   p) while increasing the amount of time needed to perform operations
   with it (generate the public key, generate and verify the signature);
   in general, the LM-OTS signature is 4+n*(p+1) bytes long, and public
   key generation will take p*(2^w-1)+1 hash computations (and signature
   generation and verification will take about half that on average).

4.3.  Private Key

   The format of the LM-OTS private key is an internal matter to the
   implementation, and this document does not attempt to define it.  One
   possibility is that the private key may consist of a typecode
   indicating the particular LM-OTS algorithm, an array x[] containing p
   n-byte strings, and the 16-byte string I and the 4 byte string q.
   This private key MUST be used to sign (at most) one message.  The
   following algorithm shows pseudocode for generating a private key.

   Algorithm 0: Generating a Private Key

  1. retrieve the value q from the type, and the value I the 16-byte
     identifier of the LMS public/private keypair that this LM-OTS private
     key will be used with

  2. set type to the typecode of the algorithm

  3. set n and p according to the typecode and Table 1

  4. compute the array x as follows:
     for ( i = 0; i < p; i = i + 1 ) {
       set x[i] to a uniformly random n-byte string
     }

  5. return u32str(type) || I || u32str(q) || x[0] || x[1] || ... || x[p-1]

   An implementation MAY use a pseudorandom method to compute x[i], as
   suggested in [Merkle79], page 46.  The details of the pseudorandom
   method do not affect interoperability, but the cryptographic strength
   MUST match that of the LM-OTS algorithm.  Appendix A provides an
   example of a pseudorandom method for computing the LM-OTS private
   key.

4.4.  Public Key

   The LM-OTS public key is generated from the private key by
   iteratively applying the function H to each individual element of x,
   for 2^w - 1 iterations, then hashing all of the resulting values.

   The public key is generated from the private key using the following
   algorithm, or any equivalent process.

   Algorithm 1: Generating a One Time Signature Public Key From a
   Private Key

   1. set type to the typecode of the algorithm

   2. set the integers n, p, and w according to the typecode and Table 1

   3. determine x, I and q from the private key

   4. compute the string K as follows:
      for ( i = 0; i < p; i = i + 1 ) {
        tmp = x[i]
        for ( j = 0; j < 2^w - 1; j = j + 1 ) {
           tmp = H(I || u32str(q) || u16str(i) || u8str(j) || tmp)
        }
        y[i] = tmp
      }
      K = H(I || u32str(q) || u16str(D_PBLC) || y[0] || ... || y[p-1])

   5. return u32str(type) || I || u32str(q) || K

   The public key is the value returned by Algorithm 1.

4.5.  Checksum

   A checksum is used to ensure that any forgery attempt that
   manipulates the elements of an existing signature will be detected.
   This checksum is needed because an attacker can freely advance any of
   the Winternitz chains.  That is, if this checksum were not present,
   then an attacker who could find a hash that has every digit larger
   than the valid hash could replace it (and adjust the Winternitz
   chains).  The security property that it provides is detailed in
   Section 12.  The checksum function Cksm is defined as follows, where
   S denotes the n-byte string that is input to that function, and the
   value sum is a 16-bit unsigned integer:

   Algorithm 2: Checksum Calculation

     sum = 0
     for ( i = 0; i < (n*8/w); i = i + 1 ) {
       sum = sum + (2^w - 1) - coef(S, i, w)
     }
     return (sum << ls)

   Because of the left-shift operation, the rightmost bits of the result
   of Cksm will often be zeros.  Due to the value of p, these bits will
   not be used during signature generation or verification.

4.6.  Signature Generation

   The LM-OTS signature of a message is generated by first prepending
   the LM key identifier I, the LM leaf identifier q, the value D_MESG
   and the randomizer C to the message, then computing the hash, and
   then concatenating the checksum of the hash to the hash itself, then
   considering the resulting value as a sequence of w-bit values, and
   using each of the w-bit values to determine the number of times to
   apply the function H to the corresponding element of the private key.
   The outputs of the function H are concatenated together and returned
   as the signature.  The pseudocode for this procedure is shown below.

   Algorithm 3: Generating a One Time Signature From a Private Key and a
   Message

     1. set type to the typecode of the algorithm

     2. set n, p, and w according to the typecode and Table 1

     3. determine x, I and q from the private key

     4. set C to a uniformly random n-byte string

     5. compute the array y as follows:
        Q = H(I || u32str(q) || u16str(D_MESG) || C || message)
        for ( i = 0; i < p; i = i + 1 ) {
          a = coef(Q || Cksm(Q), i, w)
          tmp = x[i]
          for ( j = 0; j < a; j = j + 1 ) {
             tmp = H(I || u32str(q) || u16str(i) || u8str(j) || tmp)
          }
          y[i] = tmp
        }

      6. return u32str(type) || C || y[0] || ... || y[p-1]

   Note that this algorithm results in a signature whose elements are
   intermediate values of the elements computed by the public key
   algorithm in Section 4.4.

   The signature is the string returned by Algorithm 3.  Section 7
   specifies the typecode and more formally defines the encoding and
   decoding of the string.

4.7.  Signature Verification

   In order to verify a message with its signature (an array of n-byte
   strings, denoted as y), the receiver must "complete" the chain of
   iterations of H using the w-bit coefficients of the string resulting
   from the concatenation of the message hash and its checksum.  This
   computation should result in a value that matches the provided public
   key.

   Algorithm 4a: Verifying a Signature and Message Using a Public Key

    1. if the public key is not at least four bytes long, return INVALID

    2. parse pubtype, I, q, and K from the public key as follows:
       a. pubtype = strTou32(first 4 bytes of public key)

       b. if the public key is not exactly 24 + n bytes long,
          return INVALID

       c. I = next 16 bytes of public key

       d. q = strTou32(next 4 bytes of public key)

       e. K = next n bytes of public key

    3. compute the public key candidate Kc from the signature,
       message, and the identifiers I and q obtained from the
       public key, using Algorithm 4b.  If Algorithm 4b returns
       INVALID, then return INVALID.

    4. if Kc is equal to K, return VALID; otherwise, return INVALID

  2. parse sigtype, C, and y from the signature as follows:
     a. sigtype = strTou32(first 4 bytes of signature)

     b. if sigtype is not equal to pubtype, return INVALID

         y[1] = next n bytes of signature
         ...
       y[p-1] = next n bytes of signature

  3. compute the string Kc as follows

     for ( i = 0; i < p; i = i + 1 ) {
       a = coef(Q || Cksm(Q), i, w)

       }
       z[i] = tmp
     }
     Kc = H(I || u32str(q) || u16str(D_PBLC) || z[0] || z[1] || ... || z[p-1])

  4. return Kc

5.  Leighton-Micali Signatures

   The Leighton-Micali Signature (LMS) method can sign a potentially
   large but fixed number of messages.  An LMS system uses two
   cryptographic components: a one-time signature method and a hash
   function.  Each LMS public/private key pair is associated with a
   perfect binary tree, each node of which contains an m-byte value,
   where m is the output length of the hash function.  Each leaf of the
   tree contains the value of the public key of an LM-OTS public/private
   key pair.  The value contained by the root of the tree is the LMS
   public key.  Each interior node is computed by applying the hash
   function to the concatenation of the values of its children nodes.

Internet-Draft            Hash-Based Signatures               March 2018


   Each node of the tree is associated with a node number, an unsigned
   integer that is denoted as node_num in the algorithms below, which is
   computed as follows.  The root node has node number 1; for each node
   with node number N < 2^h, its left child has node number 2*N, while
   its right child has node number 2*N+1.  The result of this is that
   each node within the tree will have a unique node number, and the
   leaves will have node numbers 2^h, (2^h)+1, (2^h)+2, ...,
   (2^h)+(2^h)-1.  In general, the j-th node at level L has node number
   2^L + j.  The node number can conveniently be computed when it is
   needed in the LMS algorithms, as described in those algorithms.

5.1.  Parameters

   An LMS system has the following parameters:

      h : the height of the tree, and

      m : the number of bytes associated with each node.

      H : a second-preimage-resistant cryptographic hash function that
      accepts byte strings of any length, and returns an m-byte string.
      H SHOULD be the same as in Section 4.1, but MAY be different.

   There are 2^h leaves in the tree.  The hash function used within the
   LMS system SHOULD be the same as the hash function used within the
   LM-OTS system used to generate the leaves.

5.2.  LMS Private Key

   The format of the LMS private key is an internal matter to the
   implementation, and this document does not attempt to define it.  One
   possibility is that it may consist of an array OTS_PRIV[] of 2^h LM-



McGrew, et al.          Expires September 6, 2018              [Page 16]

Internet-Draft            Hash-Based Signatures               March 2018


   OTS private keys, and the leaf number q of the next LM-OTS private
   key that has not yet been used.  The q-th element of OTS_PRIV[] is
   generated using Algorithm 0 with the identifiers I, q.  The leaf
   number q is initialized to zero when the LMS private key is created.
   The process is as follows:

   Algorithm 5: Computing an LMS Private Key.

      1. determine h and m from the typecode and Table 2.

      2. compute the array OTS_PRIV[] as follows:
         for ( q = 0; q < 2^h; q = q + 1) {
            OTS_PRIV[q] = LM-OTS private key with identifiers I, q
         }

      3. q = 0

   An LMS private key MAY be generated pseudorandomly from a secret
   value, in which case the secret value MUST be at least m bytes long,
   be uniformly random, and MUST NOT be used for any other purpose than
   the generation of the LMS private key.  The details of how this
   process is done do not affect interoperability; that is, the public
   key verification operation is independent of these details.
   Appendix A provides an example of a pseudorandom method for computing
   an LMS private key.

   The signature generation logic uses q as the next leaf to use, hence
   step 3 starts it off at the left-most one.

5.3.  LMS Public Key

   An LMS public key is defined as follows, where we denote the public
   key final hash value (namely, the K value computed in algorithm 1)
   associated with the i-th LM-OTS private key as OTS_PUB_HASH[i], with
   i ranging from 0 to (2^h)-1.  Each instance of an LMS public/private
   key pair is associated with a balanced binary tree, and the nodes of
   that tree are indexed from 1 to 2^(h+1)-1.  Each node is associated
   with an m-byte string, and the string for the r-th node is denoted as
   T[r] and is defined as

  T[r]=/ H(I||u32str(r)||u16str(D_LEAF)||OTS_PUB_HASH[r-2^h])   if r >= 2^h,
       \ H(I||u32str(r)||u16str(D_INTR)||T[2*r]||T[2*r+1]) otherwise.

   The LMS public key is the string u32str(type) || u32str(otstype) ||
   I || T[1].  Section 7 specifies the format of the type variable.  The
   value otstype is the parameter set for the LM-OTS public/private
   keypairs used.  The value I is the private key identifier, and is the
   value used for all computations for the same LMS tree.  The value

Internet-Draft            Hash-Based Signatures               March 2018


   T[1] can be computed via recursive application of the above equation,
   or by any equivalent method.  An iterative procedure is outlined in
   Appendix C.

5.4.  LMS Signature

   An LMS signature consists of

      the number q of the leaf associated with the LM-OTS signature, as
      a four-byte unsigned integer in network byte order,

      an LM-OTS signature,

      a typecode indicating the particular LMS algorithm,

      an array of h m-byte values that is associated with the path
      through the tree from the leaf associated with the LM-OTS
      signature to the root.

   Symbolically, the signature can be represented as u32str(q) ||
   ots_signature || u32str(type) || path[0] || path[1] || ... ||
   path[h-1].  Section 7 specifies the typecode and more formally
   defines the format.  The array of values contains the siblings of the
   nodes on the path from the leaf to the root but does not contain the
   nodes on the path themselves.  The array for a tree with height h
   will have h values.  The first value is the sibling of the leaf, the
   next value is the sibling of the parent of the leaf, and so on up the
   path to the root.

5.4.1.  LMS Signature Generation

   To compute the LMS signature of a message with an LMS private key,
   the signer first computes the LM-OTS signature of the message using
   the leaf number of the next unused LM-OTS private key.  The leaf
   number q in the signature is set to the leaf number of the LMS
   private key that was used in the signature.  Before releasing the
   signature, the leaf number q in the LMS private key MUST be
   incremented, to prevent the LM-OTS private key from being used again.
   If the LMS private key is maintained in nonvolatile memory, then the
   implementation MUST ensure that the incremented value has been stored
   before releasing the signature.  The issue this tries to prevent is a
   scenario where a) we generate a signature, using one LM-OTS private
   key, and release it to the application, b) before we update the
   nonvolatile memory, we crash, and c) we reboot, and generate a second
   signature using the same LM-OTS private key; with two different
   signatures using the same LM-OTS private key, someone could
   potentially generate a forged signature of a third message.

Internet-Draft            Hash-Based Signatures               March 2018


   The array of node values in the signature MAY be computed in any way.
   There are many potential time/storage tradeoffs that can be applied.
   The fastest alternative is to store all of the nodes of the tree and
   set the array in the signature by copying them; pseudocode to do so
   appears in Appendix D.  The least storage intensive alternative is to
   recompute all of the nodes for each signature.  Note that the details
   of this procedure are not important for interoperability; it is not
   necessary to know any of these details in order to perform the
   signature verification operation.  The internal nodes of the tree
   need not be kept secret, and thus a node-caching scheme that stores
   only internal nodes can sidestep the need for strong protections.

   Several useful time/storage tradeoffs are described in the 'Small-
   Memory LM Schemes' section of [USPTO5432852].

5.4.2.  LMS Signature Verification

   An LMS signature is verified by first using the LM-OTS signature
   verification algorithm (Algorithm 4b) to compute the LM-OTS public
   key from the LM-OTS signature and the message.  The value of that
   public key is then assigned to the associated leaf of the LMS tree,
   then the root of the tree is computed from the leaf value and the
   array path[] as described in Algorithm 6 below.  If the root value
   matches the public key, then the signature is valid; otherwise, the
   signature fails.

         tmp = H(I||u32str(node_num/2)||u16str(D_INTR)||tmp||path[i])
       node_num = node_num/2
       i = i + 1
     }
     Tc = tmp

  5. return Tc

6.  Hierarchical signatures

   In scenarios where it is necessary to minimize the time taken by the
   public key generation process, a Hierarchical N-time Signature System
   (HSS) can be used.  This hierarchical scheme, which we describe in
   this section, uses an LMS scheme as a component.  HSS, in essence,
   utilizes a tree of LMS trees, in which the HSS public key contains
   the public key of the LMS tree at the root, and an HSS signature is
   associated with a path from the root of the HSS tree to the leaf.
   Compared to LMS, HSS has a much reduced public key generation time,
   as only the root tree needs to be generated prior to the distribution
   of the HSS public key.

   Each level of the hierarchy is associated with a distinct LMS public
   key, private key, signature, and identifier.  The number of levels is
   denoted L, and is between one and eight, inclusive.  The following
   notation is used, where i is an integer between 0 and L-1 inclusive,
   and the root of the hierarchy is level 0:

Internet-Draft            Hash-Based Signatures               March 2018


      prv[i] is the LMS private key of the i-th level,

      pub[i] is the LMS public key of the i-th level (which includes the
      identifier I as well as the key value K),

      sig[i] is the LMS signature of the i-th level,

   In this section, we say that an N-time private key is exhausted when
   it has generated N signatures, and thus it can no longer be used for
   signing.

   HSS allows L=1, in which case the HSS public key and signature
   formats are essentially the LMS public key and signature formats,
   prepended by a fixed field.  Since HSS with L=1 has very little
   overhead compared to LMS, all implementations MUST support HSS in
   order to maximize interoperability.

6.1.  Key Generation

   When an HSS key pair is generated, the key pair for each level MUST
   have its own identifier I.

   To generate an HSS private and public key pair, new LMS private and
   public keys are generated for prv[i] and pub[i] for i=0, ... , L-1.
   These key pairs, and their identifiers, MUST be generated
   independently.

   The public key of the HSS scheme consists of the number of levels L,
   followed by pub[0], the public key of the top level.

   The HSS private key consists of prv[0], ... , prv[L-1].  The values
   pub[0] and prv[0] do not change, though the values of pub[i] and
   prv[i] are dynamic for i > 0, and are changed by the signature
   generation algorithm.

6.2.  Signature Generation

   To sign a message using the private key prv, the following steps are
   performed:

      If prv[L-1] is exhausted, then determine the smallest integer d
      such that all of the private keys prv[d], prv[d+1], ... , prv[L-1]
      are exhausted.  If d is equal to zero, then the HSS key pair is
      exhausted, and it MUST NOT generate any more signatures.
      Otherwise, the key pairs for levels d through L-1 must be
      regenerated during the signature generation process, as follows.
      For i from d to L-1, a new LMS public and private key pair with a
      new identifier is generated, pub[i] and prv[i] are set to those

      values, then the public key pub[i] is signed with prv[i-1], and
      sig[i-1] is set to the resulting value.

      The message is signed with prv[L-1], and the value sig[L-1] is set
      to that result.

      The value of the HSS signature is set as follows.  We let
      signed_pub_key denote an array of octet strings, where
      signed_pub_key[i] = sig[i] || pub[i+1], for i between 0 and Nspk-
      1, inclusive, where Nspk = L-1 denotes the number of signed public
      keys.  Then the HSS signature is u32str(Nspk) ||
      signed_pub_key[0] || ... || signed_pub_key[Nspk-1] || sig[Nspk].

      Note that the number of signed_pub_key elements in the signature
      is indicated by the value Nspk that appears in the initial four
      bytes of the signature.

   In the specific case of L=1, the format of an HSS signature is

      u32str(0) || sig[0]

   In the general case, the format of an HSS signature is

   u32str(Nspk) || signed_pub_key[0] || ... || signed_pub_key[Nspk-1] || sig[Nspk]

   which is equivalent to

   u32str(Nspk) || sig[0] || pub[1] || ... || sig[Nspk-1] || pub[Nspk] || sig[Nspk]

6.3.  Signature Verification

   To verify a signature sig and message using the public key pub, the
   following steps are performed:

Internet-Draft            Hash-Based Signatures               March 2018


      The signature S is parsed into its components as follows:

      Nspk = strTou32(first four bytes of S)
      if Nspk+1 is not equal to the number of levels L in pub:
         return INVALID
      for (i = 0; i < Nspk; i = i + 1) {
         siglist[i] = next LMS signature parsed from S
         publist[i] = next LMS public key parsed from S
      }
      siglist[Nspk] = next LMS signature parsed from S

      key = pub
      for (i = 0; i < Nspk; i = i + 1) {
         sig = siglist[i]
         msg = publist[i]
         if (lms_verify(msg, key, sig) != VALID):
             return INVALID
         key = msg
      return lms_verify(message, key, siglist[Nspk])


   Since the length of an LMS signature cannot be known without parsing
   it, the HSS signature verification algorithm makes use of an LMS
   signature parsing routine that takes as input a string consisting of
   an LMS signature with an arbitrary string appended to it, and returns
   both the LMS signature and the appended string.  The latter is passed
   on for further processing.

7.  Formats

   The signature and public key formats are formally defined using the
   External Data Representation (XDR) [RFC4506] in order to provide an
   unambiguous, machine readable definition.  For clarity, we also
   include a private key format as well, though consistency is not
   needed for interoperability and an implementation MAY use any private
   key format.  Though XDR is used, these formats are simple and easy to
   parse without any special tools.  An illustration of the layout of
   data in these objects is provided below.  The definitions are as
   follows:

   Many of the objects start with a typecode.  A verifier MUST check
   each of these typecodes, and a verification operation on a signature
   with an unknown type, or a type that does not correspond to the type
   within the public key MUST return INVALID.  The expected length of a
   variable-length object can be determined from its typecode, and if an
   object has a different length, then any signature computed from the
   object is INVALID.

8.  Rationale

   The goal of this note is to describe the LM-OTS, LMS and HSS
   algorithms following the original references and present the modern
   security analysis of those algorithms.  Other signature methods are
   out of scope and may be interesting follow-on work.

   We adopt the techniques described by Leighton and Micali to mitigate
   attacks that amortize their work over multiple invocations of the
   hash function.

   The values taken by the identifier I across different LMS public/
   private key pairs are chosen randomly in order to improve security.
   The analysis of this method in [Fluhrer17] shows that we do not need
   uniqueness to ensure security; we do need to ensure that we don't
   have a large number of private keys that use the same I value.  By
   randomly selecting 16 byte I values, the chance that, out of 2^64
   private keys, 4 or more of them will use the same I value is
   negligible (that is, has probability less than 2^-128).

   The reason this size was selected was to optimize the Winternitz hash
   chain operation.  With the current settings, the value being hashed
   is exactly 55 bytes long (for a 32 byte hash function), which SHA-256
   can hash in a single hash compression operation.  Other hash
   functions may be used in future specifications; all the ones that we
   will be likely to support (SHA-512/256 and the various SHA-3 hashes)
   would work well with a 16-byte I value.

   The signature and public key formats are designed so that they are
   relatively easy to parse.  Each format starts with a 32-bit



McGrew, et al.          Expires September 6, 2018              [Page 27]

Internet-Draft            Hash-Based Signatures               March 2018


   enumeration value that indicates the details of the signature
   algorithm and provides all of the information that is needed in order
   to parse the format.

   The Checksum Section 4.5 is calculated using a non-negative integer
   "sum", whose width was chosen to be an integer number of w-bit fields
   such that it is capable of holding the difference of the total
   possible number of applications of the function H as defined in the
   signing algorithm of Section 4.6 and the total actual number.  In the
   case that the number of times H is applied is 0, the sum is (2^w - 1)
   * (8*n/w).  Thus for the purposes of this document, which describes
   signature methods based on H = SHA256 (n = 32 bytes) and w = { 1, 2,
   4, 8 }, the sum variable is a 16-bit non-negative integer for all
   combinations of n and w.  The calculation uses the parameter ls
   defined in Section 4.1 and calculated in Appendix B, which indicates
   the number of bits used in the left-shift operation.

      the format listed in section 7 was correct.

      Corrected the LMS public key generation algorithm in appendix C.

Internet-Draft            Hash-Based Signatures               March 2018


   Version 06

      Modified the order of the values that were hashed to make it
      easier to prove security.

      Decreased the size of the I LMS public key identifier to 16 bytes.

   Version 05

      Clarified the L=1 specific case.

      Extended the parameter sets to include an H=25 option

      A large number of corrections and clarifications

      Added a comparison to XMSS and SPHINCS, and citations to those
      algorithms and to the recent Security Standardization Research
      2016 publications on the security of LMS and on the state
      management in hash-based signatures.

   Version 04

      Specified that, in the HSS method, the I value was computed from
      the I value of the parent LM tree.  Previous versions had the I
      value extracted from the public key (which meant that all LM trees
      of a particular level and public key used the same I value)

      Changed the length of the I field based on the parameter set.  As
      noted in the Rationale section, this allows an implementation to
      compute SHA256 n=32 based parameter sets significantly faster.

      Modified the XDR of an HSS signature not to use an array of LM
      signatures; LM signatures are variable length, and XDR doesn't
      support arrays of variable length structures.

      Changed the LMS registry to be in a consistent order with the LM-
      OTS parameter sets.  Also, added LMS parameter sets with height 15
      trees

   Previous versions

      In Algorithms 3 and 4, the message was moved from the initial
      position of the input to the function H to the final position, in
      the computation of the intermediate variable Q.  This was done to
      improve security by preventing an attacker that can find a
      collision in H from taking advantage of that fact via the forward
      chaining property of Merkle-Damgard.

      The Hierarchical Signature Scheme was generalized slightly so that
      it can use more than two levels.

      Several points of confusion were corrected; these had resulted
      from incomplete or inconsistent changes from the Merkle approach
      of the earlier draft to the Leighton-Micali approach.

   This section is to be removed by the RFC editor upon publication.

10.  IANA Considerations

   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is requested to create
   two registries: one for OTS signatures, which includes all of the LM-
   OTS signatures as defined in Section 3, and one for Leighton-Micali
   Signatures, as defined in Section 4.  Additions to these registries
   require that a specification be documented in an RFC or another
   permanent and readily available reference in sufficient detail that
   interoperability between independent implementations is possible.
   Each entry in the registry contains the following elements:

      a short name, such as "LMS_SHA256_M32_H10",

      a positive number, and

      a reference to a specification that completely defines the
      signature method test cases that can be used to verify the
      correctness of an implementation.

   Requests to add an entry to the registry MUST include the name and
   the reference.  The number is assigned by IANA.  Submitters SHOULD
   have their requests reviewed by the IRTF Crypto Forum Research Group
   (CFRG) at cfrg@ietf.org.  Interested applicants that are unfamiliar
   with IANA processes should visit http://www.iana.org.

   The numbers between 0xDDDDDDDD (decimal 3,722,304,989) and 0xFFFFFFFF
   (decimal 4,294,967,295) inclusive, will not be assigned by IANA, and
   are reserved for private use; no attempt will be made to prevent
   multiple sites from using the same value in different (and
   incompatible) ways [RFC2434].

   The LM-OTS registry is as follows.

12.  Security Considerations

   The hash function H MUST have second preimage resistance: it must be
   computationally infeasible for an attacker that is given one message
   M to be able to find a second message M' such that H(M) = H(M').

   The security goal of a signature system is to prevent forgeries.  A
   successful forgery occurs when an attacker who does not know the
   private key associated with a public key can find a message (distinct
   from all previously signed ones) and signature that is valid with
   that public key (that is, the Signature Verification algorithm
   applied to that signature and message and public key will return
   VALID).  Such an attacker, in the strongest case, may have the
   ability to forge valid signatures for an arbitrary number of other
   messages.

   LMS is provably secure in the random oracle model, where the hash
   compression function is considered the random oracle, as shown by
   [Fluhrer17].  Corollary 1 of that paper states:

      If we have no more than 2^64 randomly chosen LMS private keys,
      allow the attacker access to a signing oracle and a SHA-256 hash
      compression oracle, and allow a maximum of 2^120 hash compression
      computations, then the probability of an attacker being able to
      generate a single forgery against any of those LMS keys is less
      than 2^-129.

12.1.  Hash Formats

   The format of the inputs to the hash function H have the property
   that each invocation of that function has an input that is repeated
   by a small bounded number of other inputs (due to potential repeats
   of the I value), and in particular, will vary somewhere in the first
   23 bytes of the value being hashed.  This property is important for a
   proof of security in the random oracle model.

   The formats used during key generation and signing

      I || u32str(q) || u16str(i) || u8str(j) || tmp
      I || u32str(q) || u16str(D_PBLC) || y[0] || ... || y[p-1]
      I || u32str(q) || u16str(D_MESG) || C || message
      I || u32str(r) || u16str(D_LEAF) || OTS_PUB_HASH[r-2^h]
      I || u32str(r) || u16str(D_INTR) || T[2*r] || T[2*r+1]
      I || u32str(q) || u16str(j) || u8str(0xff) || SEED



McGrew, et al.          Expires September 6, 2018              [Page 32]

Internet-Draft            Hash-Based Signatures               March 2018


   Each hash type listed is distinct; at locations 20, 21 of each hash,
   there exists either a fixed value D_PBLC, D_MESG, D_LEAF, D_INTR, or
   a 16 bit value (i or j).  These fixed values are distinct from each
   other, and large (over 32768), while the 16 bit values are small
   (currently no more than 265; possibly being slightly larger if larger
   hash functions are supported; hence the hash invocations with i/j
   will not collide any of the D_PBLC, D_MESG, D_LEAF, D_INTR hashes.
   The only other collision possibility is the Winternitz chain hash
   colliding with the recommended pseudorandom key generation process;
   here, at location 22, the Winternitz chain function has the value
   u8str(j), where j is a value between 0 and 254, while location 22 of
   the recommended pseudorandom key generation process has value 255.

   For the Winternitz chaining function, D_PBLC, and D_MESG, the value
   of I || u32str(q) is distinct for each LMS leaf (or equivalently, for
   each q value).  For the Winternitz chaining function, the value of
   u16str(i) || u8str(j) is distinct for each invocation of H for a
   given leaf.  For D_PBLC and D_MESG, the input format is used only
   once for each value of q, and thus distinctness is assured.  The
   formats for D_INTR and D_LEAF are used exactly once for each value of
   r, which ensures their distinctness.  For the recommended
   pseudorandom key generation process, for a given value of I, q and j
   are distinct for each invocation of H.

   The value of I is chosen uniformly at random from the set of all 128
   bit strings.  If 2^64 public keys are generated (and hence 2^64
   random I values), there is a nontrivial probability of a duplicate
   (which would imply duplicate prefixes.  However, there will be an
   extremely high probability there will not be a four-way collision
   (that is, any I value used for four distinct LMS keys; probability <
   2^-132), and hence the number of repeats for any specific prefix will
   be limited to 3.  This is shown (in [Fluhrer17]) to have only a
   limited effect on the security of the system.

12.2.  Stateful signature algorithm

   The LMS signature system, like all N-time signature systems, requires
   that the signer maintain state across different invocations of the
   signing algorithm, to ensure that none of the component one-time
   signature systems are used more than once.  This section calls out
   some important practical considerations around this statefulness.

   In a typical computing environment, a private key will be stored in
   non-volatile media such as on a hard drive.  Before it is used to
   sign a message, it will be read into an application's Random Access
   Memory (RAM).  After a signature is generated, the value of the
   private key will need to be updated by writing the new value of the
   private key into non-volatile storage.  It is essential for security



McGrew, et al.          Expires September 6, 2018              [Page 33]

Internet-Draft            Hash-Based Signatures               March 2018


   that the application ensure that this value is actually written into
   that storage, yet there may be one or more memory caches between it
   and the application.  Memory caching is commonly done in the file
   system, and in a physical memory unit on the hard disk that is
   dedicated to that purpose.  To ensure that the updated value is
   written to physical media, the application may need to take several
   special steps.  In a POSIX environment, for instance, the O_SYNC flag
   (for the open() system call) will cause invocations of the write()
   system call to block the calling process until the data has been
   written to the underlying hardware.  However, if that hardware has
   its own memory cache, it must be separately dealt with using an
   operating system or device specific tool such as hdparm to flush the
   on-drive cache, or turn off write caching for that drive.  Because
   these details vary across different operating systems and devices,
   this note does not attempt to provide complete guidance; instead, we
   call the implementer's attention to these issues.

   When hierarchical signatures are used, an easy way to minimize the
   private key synchronization issues is to have the private key for the
   second level resident in RAM only, and never write that value into
   non-volatile memory.  A new second level public/private key pair will
   be generated whenever the application (re)starts; thus, failures such
   as a power outage or application crash are automatically
   accommodated.  Implementations SHOULD use this approach wherever
   possible.

12.3.  Security of LM-OTS Checksum

   To show the security of LM-OTS checksum, we consider the signature y
   of a message with a private key x and let h = H(message) and
   c = Cksm(H(message)) (see Section 4.6).  To attempt a forgery, an
   attacker may try to change the values of h and c.  Let h' and c'
   denote the values used in the forgery attempt.  If for some integer j
   in the range 0 to u, where u = ceil(8*n/w) is the size of the range
   that the checksum value can cover), inclusive,

      a' = coef(h', j, w),

      a = coef(h, j, w), and

      a' > a

   then the attacker can compute F^a'(x[j]) from F^a(x[j]) = y[j] by
   iteratively applying function F to the j-th term of the signature an
   additional (a' - a) times.  However, as a result of the increased
   number of hashing iterations, the checksum value c' will decrease
   from its original value of c.  Thus a valid signature's checksum will
   have, for some number k in the range u to (p-1), inclusive,



McGrew, et al.          Expires September 6, 2018              [Page 34]

Internet-Draft            Hash-Based Signatures               March 2018


      b' = coef(c', k, w),

      b = coef(c, k, w), and

      b' < b

   Due to the one-way property of F, the attacker cannot easily compute
   F^b'(x[k]) from F^b(x[k]) = y[k].

13.  Comparison with other work

   The eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS) [XMSS] is similar to HSS
   in several ways.  Both are stateful hash based signature schemes, and
   both use a hierarchical approach, with a Merkle tree at each level of
   the hierarchy.  XMSS signatures are slightly shorter than HSS
   signatures, for equivalent security and an equal number of
   signatures.

   HSS has several advantages over XMSS.  HSS operations are roughly
   four times faster than the comparable XMSS ones, when SHA256 is used
   as the underlying hash.  This occurs because the hash operation done
   as a part of the Winternitz iterations dominates performance, and
   XMSS performs four compression function invocations (two for the PRF,
   two for the F function) where HSS needs only perform one.
   Additionally, HSS is somewhat simpler (as each hash invocation is
   just a prefix followed by the data being hashed).

Appendix A.  Pseudorandom Key Generation

   An implementation MAY use the following pseudorandom process for
   generating an LMS private key.

      SEED is an m-byte value that is generated uniformly at random at
      the start of the process,

      I is LMS key pair identifier,

      q denotes the LMS leaf number of an LM-OTS private key,

      x_q denotes the x array of private elements in the LM-OTS private
      key with leaf number q,




McGrew, et al.          Expires September 6, 2018              [Page 37]

Internet-Draft            Hash-Based Signatures               March 2018


      j is an index of the private key element, and

      H is the hash function used in LM-OTS.

   The elements of the LM-OTS private keys are computed as:

   x_q[j] = H(I || u32str(q) || u16str(j) || u8str(0xff) || SEED).

   This process stretches the m-byte random value SEED into a (much
   larger) set of pseudorandom values, using a unique counter in each
   invocation of H.  The format of the inputs to H are chosen so that
   they are distinct from all other uses of H in LMS and LM-OTS.  A
   careful reader will note that this is similar to the hash we perform
   when iterating through the Winternitz chain; however in that chain,
   the iteration index will vary between 0 and 254 maximum (for W=8),
   while the corresponding value in this formula is 255.  This algorithm
   is included in the proof of security in [Fluhrer17] and hence this
   method is safe when used within the LMS system; however any other
   cryptographical secure method of generating private keys would also
   be safe.

Appendix B.  LM-OTS Parameter Options

   The LM-OTS one time signature method uses several internal
   parameters, which are a function of the selected parameter set.
   These internal parameters set:

      p - This is the number of independent Winternitz chains used in
      the signature; it will be the number of w-bit digits needed to
      hold the n-bit hash (u in the below equations), along with the
      number of digits needed to hold the checksum (v in the below
      equations)

      ls - This is the size of the shift needed to move the checksum so
      that it appears in the checksum digits
















McGrew, et al.          Expires September 6, 2018              [Page 38]

Internet-Draft            Hash-Based Signatures               March 2018


   The parameters ls, and p are computed as follows:

     u = ceil(8*n/w)
     v = ceil((floor(lg((2^w - 1) * u)) + 1) / w)
     ls = 16 - (v * w)
     p = u + v

   Here u and v represent the number of w-bit fields required to contain
   the hash of the message and the checksum byte strings, respectively.
   And as the value of p is the number of w-bit elements of
   ( H(message) || Cksm(H(message)) ), it is also equivalently the
   number of byte strings that form the private key and the number of
   byte strings in the signature.  The value 16 in the ls computation of
   ls corresponds to the 16 bits value used for the sum variable in
   Algorithm 2 in Section 4.5

   A table illustrating various combinations of n and w with the
   associated values of u, v, ls, and p is provided in Table 5.

Appendix C.  An iterative algorithm for computing an LMS public key

   The LMS public key can be computed using the following algorithm or
   any equivalent method.  The algorithm uses a stack of hashes for
   data.  It also makes use of a hash function with the typical

   Generating an LMS Public Key from an LMS Private Key

     for ( i = 0; i < 2^h; i = i + 1 ) {
       r = i + num_lmots_keys;
       temp = H(I || u32str(r) || u16str(D_LEAF) || OTS_PUB_HASH[i])
       j = i;
       while (j % 2 == 1) {
         r = (r - 1)/2;
         j = (j-1) / 2;
         left_side = pop(data stack);
         temp = H(I || u32str(r) || u16str(D_INTR) || left_side || temp)
       }
       push temp onto the data stack
    }
    public_key = pop(data stack)

   Note that this pseudocode expects that all 2^h leaves of the tree
   have equal depth; that is, num_lmots_keys to be a power of 2.  The
   maximum depth of the stack will be h-1 elements, that is, a total of
   (h-1)*n bytes; for the currently defined parameter sets, this will
   never be more than 768 bytes of data.

Appendix D.  Method for deriving authentication path for a signature

   The LMS signature consists of u32str(q) || ots_signature ||
   u32str(type) || path[0] || path[1] || ... || path[h-1].  This
   appendix shows one method of constructing the path[i] values,
   assuming that the implementation has stored the T[] array that was
   used to construct the public key.  Note that this is not the only
   possible method; other methods exist which don't assume that you have
   the entire T[] array in memory.  To compute path[i], you perform the
   following computations:

   Generating an LMS Path Value

     r = 2^h + q
     temp = (r / 2^i) xor 1
     return path[i] = T[temp]

   where 'xor' is the bitwise exclusive-or operation.

Appendix E.  Example Implementation

   Two example implementations can be found online at
   http://github.com/davidmcgrew/hash-sigs/ and at
   http://github.com/cisco/hash-sigs.

Appendix F.  Parameter Set Recommendations

   As for guidance as to the number of LMS level, and the size of each,
   any discussion of performance is implementation specific.  In
   general, the sole drawback for a single LMS tree is the time it takes
   to generate the public key; as every LM-OTS public key needs to be
   generated, the time this takes can be substantial.  For a two level
   tree, only the top level LMS tree and the initial bottom level LMS
   tree needs to be generated initially (before the first signature is
   generated); this will in general be significantly quicker.

   To give a general idea on the trade-offs available, we include some
   measurements taken with the github.com/cisco/hash-sigs LMS
   implementation, taken on a 3.3 GHz Xeon processor, with threading
   enabled.  We tried various parameter sets, all with W=8 (which
   minimizes signature size, while increasing time).  These are here to
   give a guideline as to what's possible; for the computational time,
   your mileage may vary, depending on the computing resources you have.
   The machine I have does not have the SHA-256 extensions; you could
   possibly do significantly better.

   ParmSet: this is the height of the Merkle tree(s); parameter sets
   listed as a single integer consists of a single Merkle tree of that
   height; parameter sets that consist of two trees are listed as x/y,
   with x being the height of the top level Merkle tree, and y being the
   bottom level.

   KeyGenTime: the measured key generation time; that is, the time
   needed to generate the public private key pair.

   SigSize: the size of a signature (in bytes)

   KeyLifetime: the lifetime of a key, assuming we generated 1000
   signatures per second.  In practice, we're not likely to get anywhere
   close to 1000 signatures per second sustained; if you have a more
   appropriate figure for your scenario, this column is pretty easy to
   recompute.

   As for signature generation or verification times, those are
   moderately insensitive to the above parameter settings (except for
   the Winternitz setting, and the number of Merkle trees for
   verification).  Tests on the same machine (without multithreading)
   gave approximately 4msec to sign a short message, 2.6msec to verify;
   these tests used a two level ParmSet; a single level would
   approximately halve the verification time.  All times can be
   significantly improved (by maybe a factor of 8) by using a parameter
   set with W=4; however that also about doubles the signature size.

Appendix G.  Test Cases

   This section provides test cases that can be used to verify or debug
   an implementation.  This data is formatted with the name of the
   elements on the left, and the value of the elements on the right, in
   hexadecimal.  The concatenation of all of the values within a public
   key or signature produces that public key or signature, and values
   that do not fit within a single line are listed across successive
   lines.
