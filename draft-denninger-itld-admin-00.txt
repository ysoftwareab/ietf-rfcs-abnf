Abstract
========

This memorandum shall be entitled "TOP LEVEL DOMAIN DELEGATION DRAFT",
and describes a proposed policy, procedure and control structure for
the allocation of additional top-level domains.

This memorandum discusses the issues surrounding additional top level
domains (TLDs), qualification proposals for operating such a registry,
and justifications for the positions expressed in this paper.

The IETF, IANA, NEWDOM and related mailing lists are welcome to read,
and comment, on this material.  Presuming a consensus can be found
within these audiences, the distribution of this memorandum should be
expanded to include general commentary from the Internet community.


Revisions
=========

As a draft, this document may be revised at any time.  The revision
number of the document in question is displayed at the top of the
masthead, and should be referred to when commenting on the proposal
contained in this draft.



Operating Assumptions
=====================

This draft is written under the following assumptions:

1)	It is desirable to have competing domain registries for commercial,
	educational, and other uses (organizational, etc).

2)	The current monopoly situation with regards to these domain spaces,
	and the inherent perceived value of being registered under a
	single top level domain (.COM) is undesirable and should be, to
	the extent possible, neutralized.

3)	Open, free-market competition has proven itself in other areas of
	the provisioning of related services (ISPs, NSPs, telephone
	companies, etc) and as such appears applicable to this set of
	situations.

4)	It is considered undesirable to have enormous numbers (100,000+)
	of top-level domains for administrative reasons and the
	unreasonable burden such would place on organizations such as
	the IANA.

5)	It is not, however, undesirable to have diversity in the top-level
	domain space, and in fact, positive market forces dictate that
	this diversity, obtained through free competition, is the best
	means available to insure quality service to end-users and
	customers.

6)	The two-character namespace is, and will remain, reserved for ISO
	country codes under existing accepted Internet RFCs.

7)	It is desirable to maintain a "short" suffix on these TLDs to permit
	easier use by the public.  As such, the presumption will be
	that only three and four-character alphanumeric TLDs will be
	assigned under this proposal.  TLDs which are registered
	trademarks under US Federal Law are specifically excluded from
	consideration as appropriate assignments.

8)	It is desirable to keep the IANA and IETF from becoming involved in
	operational and contractual aspects of the TLD registries, and
	it is further desirable to separate, to the extent possible,
	the IETF and IANA funding from these entities.  The presence of
	a funding path creates a tying arrangement between for-profit
	organizations and a set of non-profit entities which up to now
	have not been legally, financially, or otherwise encumbered by
	the actions of these registries.  It is presumed in the best
	interest of the IETF and the IANA to see that this separation
	of function is preserved.

	Indemnification provisions from the registries to the IANA and
	related organizations, as provided for in other proposals, do
	not serve to properly insulate the ISOC, IANA and IETF from
	legal proceedings, as it should be presumed that any
	organization which is legally challenged in a significant
	fashion may be unable to properly pay any judgements levied
	against it.  Current "deep pockets" legal practice exposes
	related organizations to the negative effects of these legal
	actions should the original organization be unable to fulfill
	its financial obligations.


Items Not Addressed
===================

The following items are intentionally omitted from discussion in this
draft:

1)	Cooperation between competing TLD registries.  This is
	specifically not assumed in this proposal, and is considered to
	be an operational aspect of a registry best determined, and
	coordinated, by contractual agreements between private
	interests.

2)	A "global phonebook" of second-level domain holders.  TLD
	registries are expected to provide their own directory service,
	and "rWhois" is designated as one of the operational choices
	which a registry may wish to utilize.  However, no attempt is
	made to mandate any particular technical or organizational
	requirements from a registry to service requests for lookups of
	a domain holder in other, competing registries and TLDs.

3)	Internal database and operational issues.  These issues,
	including pricing to customers of the registry, are properly
	free-market issues and should be excluded from the control of
	the IETF, IANA, ISOC and other related organizations.

4)	Succession issues related to the relationships between customers
	of a registry and that registry itself.  These matters are
	properly contractual matters between the registry and those
	entities requesting registration services.  It is further
	presumed that any registry with a significant client base will
	constitute a legitimate on-going business interest with revenue
	prospects sufficient to insure that the registry will in fact
	be transferred to another entity.  As an example, presuming
	5,000 registrants of a given registry and a fee of $50.00 per
	year, a revenue stream of $250,000 (US) per year would inure to
	the benefit of any organization taking over the services of a
	defunct organization.

	Should a registry close without having significant second-level
	registrations in place at that time, the impact to the Internet
	users as a whole will be minimal or non-existant.




Technical Requirements
======================

A commercial or other interest which wishes to operate a TLD shall
propose to the IANA the assignment of that domain, and include with its
application for same the following information:

1)	A diagram substantiating full multi-homed connectivity to the
	organization's computers which will serve that top-level
	domain, with each leg of that connectivity being at a
	non-aggregated data rate of 1.536Mbps (US standard ESF/B8ZS T1)
	or better.  Route advertisement via BGP4 for this
	organization's connectivity must be operational for at least
	two of the connections maintained under this multi-homed
	provision, and the network involved should be operating in a
	"defaultless" configuration.

2)	Operation of at least two (2) nameservers for the top-level
	domain in question.  These nameservers shall run the latest
	"consumable" release of the BIND code (4.9.x at present), and
	may include local enhancements, changes, or operational
	improvements.  

3)	The three or four character TLD proposed, along with an
	indemnity statement indemnifying the IANA for any infringement
	of trademark which may be created by the IANA authorizing this
	assignment.

4)	The name(s) and IP addresses of the hosts which are proposed to
	serve this TLD, with correct top-level NS records installed and
	available for verification.

5)	A statement that the registrant is in an Internet-related line of
	business, and intends to operate the registry for a period of
	not less than two (2) consecutive years.

6)	A written offer, which may or may not be called by the ISOC and
	IANA, to operate a top-level domain server as part of the
	general Internet infrastructure.  This commitment to provide
	this service shall be perpetual during the life of the registry
	which is delegated, even if the IANA, ISOC or IETF shall deem
	it unnecessary or inadvisable to request that this service be
	provided at the inception of the domain space requested.


Administrative Requirements
===========================

Each entity holding a TLD shall be required to provide the following
administrative services and policies:

1)	A means, via the "whois" protocol, to search the database of
	second-level domains maintained by this registry and return
	common directory information.  This information shall include,
	but not necessarily be limited to:

	a)	The "owner" of the second-level domain, including
		contact name(s), physical address(es), and telephone
		number(s) of the persons responsible for the operation
		of the second-level domain.

	b)	The nameserver hostnames and IP numbers serving that
		second-level domain.

	c)	The current status (operational, on hold, pending, etc)
		of that second-level domain.

2)	A help desk and staff to answer questions via electronic mail,
	fax and normal telephone during customary business hours.

3)	A published registration, fee, and service policy, available via
	WWW, FTP and automated email responder at an address associated
	with the organization.

4)	An administrative fee of US $1,000 per annum to be paid to the
	IANA for its oversight of this process.

5)	Only one TLD may be operated by any single organization, with the
	exception of existing TLD names which are currently assigned.
	These will be grandfathered into the execution of this
	procedure (ie: NSI which currently operates .ORG and .COM).

6)	The DNS zone files and "whois" databases maintained by any TLD
	operator is deemed to be publically available and public,
	non-protected information; the IANA is authorized to designate
	one or more organizations as "escrow holders" of said zone
	information for the purposes outlined below under "Deletion or
	Transfer of a TLD".

7)	For the purposes of this document, an "entity" may be any
	combination of organizations which may combine to offer
	registration services under one TLD name as a cooperative or
	competitive provider of services, provided that all members of
	the confederation or alliance shall otherwise be in complience
	with the terms of this document.  Organizations granted TLD
	namespace may add or remove additional cooperating registration
	entities at their discretion, provided that doing so does not
	violate the provisions of this memorandum.


IANA Responsibilities
=====================

The IANA or its designee shall evaluate all applications for TLD domain
space in a neutral, impartial, and open manner.  All proceedings and
evaluations of the applications submitted shall be available for public
inspection via an on-line procedure (web site, etc) along with the
decisions made.

TLD requests shall be granted in the order submitted provided that the
technical and administrative requirements are met by the organization
making the request.

The IANA or its designee shall approve conforming applications within
30 days from the date of application.  Rejected applications shall
state the specific reason(s) for which a rejection has taken place.

The IANA may designate one or more entities to independant evaluate the
applications made for top-level-domain space on a contracted or other
basis as the IANA shall deem proper, so long as the other requirements
of this memorandum are complied with.

The IANA or its designee may operate one or more "escrow services" to
insure that the records contained in a registry will remain available
in the event of intentional or accidential destruction due to a
registry forfeiting a TLD under this memorandum.


Deletion or Transfer of a TLD; Escrow of Records
================================================

Organizations providing registry services may elect to terminate their
involvement in this program and release the TLD namespace delegated to
their organization under the following circumstances:

1)	Any organization may transfer the authority for, and
	registration services provided, for a TLD to any other entity
	*provided* that the new registration authority complies with
	all provisions of this memorandum.  The business and financial
	terms under which this transfer is conducted shall be properly
	between the old and new registry organizations and not under
	the jurisdiction of the IANA, the IETF or the ISOC.


2)	TLDs which are "orphaned" by a registry that constructively
	abandons them or ceases business operations without first
	securing a successor organization to assume the authority and
	registration services for that namespace shall be deemed
	"abandoned".  Abandoned TLD namespace shall be auctioned to the
	highest bidder by an open, competitive bid process adjudicted
	by the IANA or its designees, which shall be conducted without
	undue delay.  During the interim period in question the IANA
	shall be authorized to designate one or more firm(s) to hold
	the existing registration records to prevent the interruption
	of service.


3)	An organization which is alleged to be in violation of the
	terms of this delegation memorandum shall be given notice of
	intent to recover the TLD domain space allocated under this
	policy via normal postal mail.  Within 30 days, the
	organization against which the complaint has been lodged shall
	(a) cure the violation(s) of this policy, (b) transfer
	authority to another entity under (1) above, or (c)
	constructively abandon for public auction the namespace under
	the provisions of (2) above.  Where the facts are disputed
	regarding possible violations of this policy, the IANA is
	authorized to promulgate reasonable adjudication policies which
	should include an arbitration provision.
