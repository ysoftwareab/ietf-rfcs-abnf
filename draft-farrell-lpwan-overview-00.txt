                             LPWAN Overview
                    draft-farrell-lpwan-overview-00

Abstract

   Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are wireless technologies with
   characteristics such as large coverage areas, low bandwidth, possibly
   very small packet and application layer data sizes and long battery
   life operation.  This memo is an informational overview of the set of
   LPWAN technologies being considered in the IETF and of the gaps that
   exist between the needs of those technologies and the goal of running
   IP in LPWANs.

Status of This Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

1.  Introduction

   [[Editor comments/queries are in double square brackets like this.]]

   This document provides background material and an overview of the
   technologies being considered in the IETF's Low Power Wide-Area
   Networking (LPWAN) working group.  We also provide a gap analysis
   between the needs of these technologies and currently available IETF
   specifications.

   This document is largely the work of the people listed in Section 8.
   Discussion of this document should take place on the lpwan@ietf.org
   list.

   [[Editor's note: the eventual fate of this draft is a topic for the
   WG to consider - it might end up as a useful RFC, or it might be best
   maintained as a draft only until its utility has dissapated.  FWIW,
   the editor doesn't mind what outcome the WG choose.]]

2.  Terminology

   [[Not sure if 2119 terms will be needed.  Leave it here for now.]]
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   [[Extract common terms here.  Maybe define and relate technology
   specific terms, e.g. lora g/w similar to sigfox bs etc.  There is
   text for this in the current "gaps" draft.]]

3.  Common Concerns

   [[Editors note: We may want a section like this that describes some
   cross-cutting issues, e.g. duty-cycles, some of the ISM band
   restrictions.  This isn't intended to be a problem statement nor a
   set of requirements but just to describe some issues that affect more
   than one of the LPWAN technologies.  Such a section might be better
   before or after Section 4, will see when text's added there.  There
   is some text for this in the current "gaps" draft.]]

4.  LPWAN Technologies

   This section provides an overview of the set of LPWAN technologies
   that are being considered in the LPWAN working group.  The text for
   each was mainly contributed by the proponents of each technology.

   Note that this text is not intended to be normative in any sesne, but
   simply to help the reader in finding the relevant layer 2
   specifications and in understanding how those integrate with IETF-
   defined technologies.  Similarly, there is no attempt here to set out
   the pros and cons of the relevant technologies.  [[Editor: I assume
   that's the right target here.  Please comment if you disagree.]]

   [[Editor's note: the goal here is 2-3 pages per technology.  If
   there's much more needed then we could add appendices I guess
   depending on what text the WG find useful to include.]]

4.1.  LoRaWAN

   [[Text TBD, I-D co-authored by the editor of this document and Alper
   is planned to be published Wed Oct 26]]

4.2.  Narrowband IoT (nb-iot)

   [[Add text here from [I-D.ratilainen-lpwan-nb-iot].]]

4.3.  Sigfox

   [[Add text here from [I-D.zuniga-lpwan-sigfox-system-description].]]
