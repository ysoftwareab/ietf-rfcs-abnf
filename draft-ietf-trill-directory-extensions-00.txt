                       TRILL Directory Extensions
             <draft-ietf-trill-directory-extensions-00.txt>


Abstract

   TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) push and pull
   directories (RFC 7067) specified in draft-ietf-trill-directory-
   assist-mechanisms provide directory services to TRILL switches but
   not to end stations. This document extends those services so that end
   stations can pull directory information from Pull Directory severs
   and can have directory information pushed to them from Push Directory
   servers. In each case, at least one co-operating edge TRILL switch is
   required.

INTERNET-DRAFT                            Directory Assisted TRILL Encap


1. Introduction

   TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) [RFC6325] push
   and pull directories [RFC7067] specified in [Directory] provide
   directory services to TRILL switches but not to end stations. This
   document extends those services so that end stations can pull
   directory information from Pull Directory severs and can have
   directory information pushed to them from Push Directory servers. In
   each case, at least one co-operating edge RBridge is required.

   Section 2 specifies the extensions to Pull Directories. Section 3
   Specifies the extensions to Push Directories.



1.1 Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   TBD

2. Extensions to Pull Directory

   Pull Directory support is optionally extended to end station clients
   as specified in this section.

   When Pull Directory support is provided by an edge RBridge to end
   stations, the messages used are as specified in [Directory] for the
   support of a Pull Directory hosted on an end station with the
   following changes:

   (1) a different RBridge Channel [RFC7178] protocol number is used,
       and

   (2) the roles of the end station and edge RBridge are reversed, that
       is, instead of the edge RBridge using a Pull Directory on an end
       station there is an end station using a Pull Directory service
       through an edge RBridge.

   An end station can tell which, if any, of the edge RBridges to which
   it is attached support this service by examining their TRILL IS-IS
   Hellos messages to see if they support the "Pull Directory Service to
   End Station" RBridge Channel Protocol (see Section 4).

4. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an RBridge Channel protocol number from
   the range assigned based on standards action as the "Pull Directory
   Service to End Station" protocol adding a line to the RBridge Channel
   Protocols registry on the TRILL Parameters web page as follows:

      Protocol Description                           Reference
      -------- -----------                           ---------
         TBD   Pull Directory Service to End Station [this document]

5. Security Considerations

   TBD

   For security considerations of directory services, see [Directory].

   For general TRILL security considerations, see [RFC6325].
