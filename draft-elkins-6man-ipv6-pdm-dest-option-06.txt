       IPv6 Performance and Diagnostic Metrics Destination Option
               draft-elkins-6man-ipv6-pdm-dest-option-06


Abstract

   To diagnose performance and connectivity problems, metrics on passive
   traffic are critical for timely end-to-end problem resolution. Such
   diagnostics may be real-time or after the fact, but must not impact
   an operational production network. The base metrics are: packet
   sequence number and packet timestamp.  Metrics derived from these
   will be described separately. This document solves these problems
   with a new destination option, the Performance and Diagnostic Metrics
   destination option (PDM).

1  Introduction

   To diagnose performance and connectivity problems, metrics on passive
   traffic are critical for timely end-to-end problem resolution. Such
   diagnostics may be real-time or after the fact, but must not impact
   an operational production network. The base metrics are: packet
   sequence number and packet timestamp.

   For background, please see draft-zheng-framework-passive-01
   [Passive]. This draft provides a foundation to this document.

   As discussed in the above Internet Draft, passive measurement is
   preferred for measuring end-user Quality of Experience (QoE) as well
   as peak capacity demands.  This document provides a solution for
   obtaining such metrics.

   As defined in RFC2460 [RFC2460], destination options are carried by
   the IPv6 Destination Options extension header.  Destination options
   include optional information that need be examined only by the IPv6
   node given as the destination address in the IPv6 header, not by
   routers or other "middle boxes".  This document specifies a new
   destination option, the Performance and Diagnostic Metrics
   destination option (PDM).

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2  Performance and Diagnostic Metrics Destination Option

2.1  Destination Options Header

   The IPv6 Destination Options Header is used to carry optional
   information that need be examined only by a packet's destination
   node(s). The Destination Options Header is identified by a Next
   Header value of 60 in the immediately preceding header and is defined
   in RFC2460 [RFC2460].

2.2  PDM Types

   The IPv6 Performance and Diagnostic Metrics Destination Option (PDM)
   is an implementation of the Destination Options Header (Next Header
   value = 60).  The PDM does not require time synchronization.

2.3  Performance and Diagnostic Metrics Destination Option

INTERNET DRAFT    elkins-6man-ipv6-pdm-dest-option-06          July 2014


   The Performance and Diagnostic Metrics Destination Option (PDM)
   contains the following fields:

   PSNTP    : Packet Sequence Number This Packet
   PSNLR    : Packet Sequence Number Last Received
   DELTALR  : Delta Last Received
   PSNLS    : Packet Sequence Number Last Sent
   DELTALS  : Delta Last Sent



   The PDM destination option is encoded in type-length-value (TLV)
   format as follows:


   0                   1                   2                   3

   Option Type

   TBD = 0xXX (TBD)  [To be assigned by IANA] [RFC2780]

   Option Length


   8-bit unsigned integer. Length of the option, in octets, excluding
   the Option Type and Option Length fields. This field MUST be set to
   22.


   Packet Sequence Number This Packet (PSNTP)

   16-bit unsigned integer.  This field will wrap. It is intended for
   human use.

   Initialized at a random number and monotonically incremented for
   packet on the 5-tuple.  The 5-tuple consists of the source and
   destination IP addresses, the source and destination ports, and the

INTERNET DRAFT    elkins-6man-ipv6-pdm-dest-option-06          July 2014


   upper layer protocol (ex. TCP, ICMP, etc).

   Operating systems MUST implement a separate packet sequence number
   counter per 5-tuple. Operating systems MUST NOT implement a single
   counter for all connections.

   Note: This is consistent with the current implementation of the IPID
   field in IPv4 for many, but not all, stacks.


   Packet Sequence Number Last Received (PSNLR)

   16-bit unsigned integer.  This is the PSN of the packet last received
   on the 5-tuple.


   Packet Sequence Number Last Sent (PSNLS)

   16-bit unsigned integer.  This is the PSN of the packet last sent on
   the 5-tuple.


   Delta TimeStamp Type (TIMETYPE)

   4-bit unsigned integer.  This is the type of time contained in the
   delta fields below.

   0 - unknown 1 - time is in units of nanoseconds 2 - time is in units
   of microseconds 3 - time is in units of milliseconds 4 - time is in
   units of seconds 5 - time is in units of minutes 6 - time is in units
   of hours 7 - time is in units of days

   The values 5 - 7 are relevant for Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN) which
   may operate with long delays between packets.


   Delta Last Received (DELTALR)

   A 16-bit unsigned integer field.  This is server delay.

   DELTALR = Send time packet 2 - Receive time packet 1

   The value is according to the scale in TIMETYPE.


   Delta Last Sent (DELTALS)

   A 16-bit unsigned integer field.  This is round trip or end-to-end

   time.

   Delta Last Sent = Receive time packet 2 - Send time packet 1

   The value is in according to the scale in TIMETYPE.


   Option Type

   The two highest-order bits of the Option Type field are encoded to
   indicate specific processing of the option; for the PDM destination
   option, these two bits MUST be set to 00. This indicates the
   following processing requirements:

     00 - skip over this option and continue processing the header.

   RFC2460 [RFC2460] defines other values for the Option Type field.
   These MUST NOT be used in the PDM.  The other values are as follows:

         01 - discard the packet.

         10 - discard the packet and, regardless of whether or not the
   packet's Destination Address was a multicast address, send an ICMP
   Parameter Problem, Code 2, message to the packet's Source Address,
   pointing to the unrecognized Option Type.

         11 - discard the packet and, only if the packet's Destination
   Address was not a multicast address, send an ICMP Parameter Problem,
   Code 2, message to the packet's Source Address, pointing to the
   unrecognized Option Type.


   In keeping with RFC2460 [RFC2460], the third-highest-order bit of the
   Option Type specifies whether or not the Option Data of that option
   can change en-route to the packet's final destination.


   In the PDM, the value of the third-highest-order bit MUST be 0.  The
   possible values are as follows:

         0 - Option Data does not change en-route

         1 - Option Data may change en-route

   The three high-order bits described above are to be treated as part
   of the Option Type, not independent of the Option Type.  That is, a
   particular option is identified by a full 8-bit Option Type, not just
   the low-order 5 bits of an Option Type.

2.4 Header Placement


   The PDM destination option MUST be placed as follows:

      - Before the upper-layer header.  That is, this is the last
   extension header.

   This follows the order defined in RFC2460 [RFC2460]

              IPv6 header

              Hop-by-Hop Options header

              Destination Options header

              Routing header

              Fragment header

              Authentication header

              Encapsulating Security Payload header

              Destination Options header

              upper-layer header

   For each IPv6 packet header, the PDM MUST NOT appear more than once.
   However, an encapsulated packet MAY contain a separate PDM associated
   with each encapsulated IPv6 header.

   The inclusion of a PDM in a packet affects the receiving node's
   processing of only this single packet. No state is created or
   modified in the receiving node as a result of receiving a PDM in a
   packet.

2.5  Implementation Considerations

   The PDM destination options extension header SHOULD be turned on by
   each stack on a host node.

2.5.1 Dynamic Configuration Options

   If implemented, each operating system MUST have a default
   configuration parameter, e.g. diag_header_sys_default_value=yes/no.
   The operating system MAY also have a dynamic configuration option to
   change the configuration setting as needed.

   If the PDM destination options extension header is used, then it MAY
   be turned on for all packets flowing through the host, applied to an
   upper-layer protocol (TCP, UDP, SCTP, etc), a local port, or IP
   address only.  These are at the discretion of the implementation.

   The PDM MUST NOT be changed dynamically via packet flow as this may
   create potential security violation or DoS attack by numerous packets
   turning the header on and off.

   As with all other destination options extension headers, the PDM is
   for destination nodes only. As specified above, intermediate devices
   MUST neither set nor modify this field.

2.5.2 Data Length Filtering

   Different results for derived metrics, such as, server delay, will be
   obtained if calculations are done including or excluding packets
   which have a data length of 0 or 1.  Some protocols, for example,
   TCP, provide acknowledgements which have a length of 0.  Keep-alive
   packets have a data length of 0 or 1.

   Operating systems may provide the user a choice of whether to include
   or exclude packets with a 0 or 1 byte data length.

2.5.3 5-tuple Aging

   Within the operating system, metrics must be kept on a 5-tuple basis.
    As discussed before, these are:

      PSNTP : Packet Sequence Number This Packet
      TSTP  : Timestamp This Packet
      PSNLR : Packet Sequence Number Last Received
      TSLR  : Timestamp Last Received
      PROTC : Protocol for Upper Layer (ex. TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc)

   The question comes of when to stop keeping data or restarting the

INTERNET DRAFT    elkins-6man-ipv6-pdm-dest-option-06          July 2014


   numbering for a 5-tuple.  For example, in the case of TCP, at some
   point, the connection will terminate.  Keeping data in control blocks
   forever, will have unfortunate consequences for the operating system.

   So, the recommendation is to use a known aging parameter such as Max
   Segment Lifetime (MSL) as defined in Transmission Control Protocol
   [RFC0793].  The choice of aging parameter is left up to the
   implementation.


3  Backward Compatibility

   The scheme proposed in this document is backward compatible with all
   the currently defined IPv6 extension headers. According to RFC2460
   [RFC2460], if the destination node does not recognize this option, it
   should skip over this option and continue processing the header.

4  Security Considerations

   The PDM MUST NOT be changed dynamically via packet flow as this
   creates a possibility for potential security violations or DoS
   attacks by numerous packets turning the header on and off.


5  IANA Considerations

   An option type must be assigned by IANA for the Performance and
   Diagnostic Metrics destination option.
