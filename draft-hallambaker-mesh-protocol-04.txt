                   draft-hallambaker-mesh-protocol-04

Abstract

   The Mathematical Mesh 'The Mesh' is an end-to-end secure
   infrastructure that facilitates the exchange of configuration and
   credential data between multiple user devices.  The core protocols of
   the Mesh are described with examples of common use cases and
   reference data.

Internet-Draft           Mesh Protocol Reference            January 2020


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the Mesh Service protocol supported by Mesh
   Services, an account-based protocol that facilitates exchange of data
   between devices connected to a Mesh profile and between Mesh
   accounts.

   Mesh Service Accounts support the following services:

   *  Provides the master persistence store for the Catalogs and Spools
      associated with the account.

   *  Enables synchronization of Catalogs and Spools with connected
      devices.

   *  Enforces access control on inbound Mesh Messages from other users
      and other Mesh Services.

   *  Authenticates outbound Mesh Messages, certifying that they comply
      with abuse mitigation policies.

   A Mesh Profile MAY be bound to multiple Mesh Service Accounts at the
   same time but only one Mesh Service Account is considered to be
   authoritative at a time.  Users may add or remove Mesh Service
   Accounts and change the account designated as authoritative at any
   time.

   The Mesh Services are build from a very small set of primitives which
   provide a surprisingly extensive set of capabilities.  These
   primitives are:

   "Hello"  Describes the features and options provided by the service
      and provides a 'null' transaction which MAY be used to establish
      an authentication ticket without performing any action,

   CreateAccount, DeleteAccount  Manage the creation and deletion of
      accounts at the service.

   Status, Download, "Upload"  Support synchronization of Mesh
      containers between the service (Master) and the connected devices
      (Replicas).

   Connect  Initiate the process of connecting a device to a Mesh
      profile from the device itself.

   Post  Request that a Mesh Message be transferred to one or more Mesh
      Accounts.

   Although these functions could in principle be used to replace many
   if not most existing Internet application protocols, the principal
   value of any communication protocol lies in the size of the audience
   it allows them to communicate with.  Thus, while the Mesh Messaging
   service is designed to support efficient and reliable transfer of
   messages ranging in size from a few bytes to multiple terabytes, the
   near-term applications of these services will be to applications that
   are not adequately supported by existing protocols if at all.

2.  Definitions

   This section presents the related specifications and standard, the
   terms that are used as terms of art within the documents and the
   terms used as requirements language.

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.2.  Defined Terms

   The terms of art used in this document are described in the _Mesh
   Architecture Guide_ [draft-hallambaker-mesh-architecture].

2.3.  Related Specifications

   The architecture of the Mathematical Mesh is described in the _Mesh
   Architecture Guide_ [draft-hallambaker-mesh-architecture].  The Mesh
   documentation set and related specifications are described in this
   document.

2.4.  Implementation Status

   The implementation status of the reference code base is described in
   the companion document [draft-hallambaker-mesh-developer].

3.  Mesh Service

   A Mesh Service is a minimally trusted service.  In particular a user
   does not need to trust a Mesh service to protect the confidentiality
   or integrity of most data stored in the account catalogs and spools.

   Unless the use of the Mesh Service is highly restricted, a user does
   need to trust the Mesh Service in certain respects:





Hallam-Baker              Expires 19 July 2020                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft           Mesh Protocol Reference            January 2020


   Data Loss  A service could refuse to respond to requests to download
      data.

   Integrity (Stale Data)  The use of Merkle Trees limits but does not
      eliminate the ability of a Mesh Service to respond to requests
      with stale data.

   Messaging  A service could reject requests to post messages to or
      accept messages from other mesh users.

      This risk is a necessary consequence of the fact that the Mesh
      Service Provider is accountable to other Mesh Service Providers
      for abuse originating from their service.

   Traffic analysis  A Mesh Service has knowledge of the number of Mesh
      Messages being sent and received by its users and the addresses to
      which they are being sent to or received from.

   The need to trust the Mesh Service in these respects is mitigated by
   accountability and the user's ability to change Mesh Service
   providers at any time they choose with minimal inconvenience.

   It is possible that some of these risks will be reduced in future
   versions of the Mesh Service Protocol but it is highly unlikely that
   these can be eliminated entirely without compromising practicality or
   efficiency.

3.1.  Data Model

   The design of the Mesh Service model followed a quasi-formal approach
   in which the system was reduced to schemas which could in principle
   be rendered in a formal development method but without construction
   of proofs.

   Like the contents of Mesh Accounts, a Mesh Service may be represented
   by a collection of catalogs and spools, for example:

   Account Catalog  Contains the account entries.

   Incident Spool  Reports of potential abuse

   Backup of the service MAY be implemented using the same container
   synchronization mechanism used to synchronize account catalogs and
   spools.

Internet-Draft           Mesh Protocol Reference            January 2020


3.2.  Partitioning

   Mesh Services supporting a large number of accounts or large activity
   volume MAY partition the account catalog between one or more hosts
   using the usual tiered service model in which a front-end server
   receives traffic for any account hosted at the server and routes the
   request to the back-end service that provides the persistence store
   for that account.

   In addition, the Mesh Service Protocol supports a 'direct connection'
   partitioning model in which devices are given a DNS name which MAY
   allow for direct connection to the persistence host or to a front-end
   service offering service that is in some way specific to that
   account.

4.  Protocol Bindings

   Mesh Service transactions are mapped to an underlying messaging and
   transport protocol.  The following binding

   Mesh Services MUST support the Web Service binding specified in this
   document and MAY support the UDP binding currently in development.

4.1.  DNS Web Service Discovery

   The DNS Web Service discovery mechanism is used to discover Mesh
   Services regardless of the protocol binding .The service name, DNS
   prefix and and .well-known service suffix are specified as follows:

   *  Service Name: mmm

   *  DNS Prefix: _mmm._tcp

   *  Well Known service suffix: /.well-known/mmm

4.2.  Web Service Protocol Binding

   The Web Service Protocol binding makes use of the most widely
   deployed and used protocols:

   *  Discovery: DNS Service discovery

   *  Transport: TLS

   *  Application: HTTP

   *  Presentation: DARE Message

Internet-Draft           Mesh Protocol Reference            January 2020


   *  Encoding: JSON, JSON-B

   The chief limitations of the Web Service Protocol Binding are that
   the use of TCP based transport results in unsatisfactory latency for
   some applications and that the HTTP application layer only serves to
   allow a host to support multiple services on the same TCP/IP port.

4.2.1.  Transport Security

   Mesh Services MUST offer TLS transport and MAY offer non TLS
   transport.  MESH clients SHOULD use TLS transport when connecting to
   a MESH service.

   TLS version 1.3 [RFC8446] or higher MUST be supported.  Client
   authentication SHOULD NOT be used.

4.2.2.  HTTP Message Binding

   All messages are exchanged as HTTP POST transactions.  Support for
   and use of HTTP/1.1 [RFC7230] is REQUIRED.  Services MAY support
   HTTP/2.

   In contrast to other approaches to the design of Web Services, the
   only use made of the HTTP transport is to distinguish between
   different services on the same host using the Host header and .well-
   known convention and for message framing.  No use is made of the URI
   request line to identify commands, nor are the caching or proxy
   capabilities of HTTP made use of.

4.2.3.  Request

   The HTTP request MAY contain any valid HTTP header specified in
   [RFC7230].

   Request Line URI  "/well-known/"<service> (unless overridden using a
      TXT path attribute)

   Request Line Method  POST

   Host: Header  <domain>

   Content-Encoding  As specified in section yy below.

   Content-Type  As specified in section zz below.

   Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding  As specified in [RFC7230].

   Payload  The content payload as specified in section XX below.

   [Note, this is showing the payload, not the binding as is intended
   because the current code doesn't implement it as intended yet]

   {
     "Hello": {}}

4.2.4.  Response

   The response MAY contain any HTTP response header but since JWB
   services do not make use of HTTP caching and messages are not
   intended to be modified by HTTP intermediaries, only a limited number
   of headers have significance:

   Response Code  The HTTP response code.  This is processed as
      described in section zz below.

   Content-Type  As specified in section zz below.

   Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding  As specified in [RFC7230].

   Cache-Control  Since the only valid HTTP method for a JWB request is
      POST, JWB responses are not cacheable.  The use of the cache-
      control header is therefore unnecessary.  However, experience
      suggests that reviewers find it easier to understand protocol
      specifications if they are reminded of the fact that caching is
      neither supported nor desired.

4.3.  DARE Message Encapsulation

   The payload of the HTTP requests and responses is a DARE Message
   whose payload contains the Mesh Service request or response.

   The DARE Message encapsulation is used to authenticate the request or
   response data.  The form of the authentication depending on the
   credentials available to the sender at the time the request is made.

   Mesh Service MUST support the use of Mutually Authenticated Key




Hallam-Baker              Expires 19 July 2020                 [Page 10]

   Exchange [draft-hallambaker-mesh-security] to establish the Master
   Key used for authentication of requests and responses.

   Requests and Responses MUST be authenticated.  Requests and Responses
   MUST be encrypted if the transport is not encrypted and MAY be
   encrypted otherwise.

4.3.1.  Null Authentication

   Null Authentication MAY be used to make a "Hello" Request.

   The Null Authentication mechanism MUST NOT be used for any Mesh
   Service request or response other than a "Hello" request.

   Since the Mutually Authenticated key exchange requires both parties
   to know the public key of the other, it is not possible for a client
   to authenticate itself to the service until it has obtained the
   service public key.  One means by which the client MAY obtain the
   service public key is by requesting the service return the credential
   in a "Hello" transaction.

4.3.2.  Device Authentication

   Device Authentication is used in two circumstances

   *  When requesting creation of an account

   *  When a device is requesting connection to a profile.

4.3.3.  Profile Authentication

   Profile Authentication has the same form as Device Authentication
   except that the client provides its Device Connection Assertion as
   part of the request:

4.3.4.  Ticket Authentication

   Ticket Authentication is used after a device has obtained an
   authentication ticket from a service.  The ticket is returned in the
   response to a previous Profile Authentication exchange.

4.4.  Payload Encoding

   The Dare Message payload of a "Hello" request MUST be encoded in JSON
   encoding.  The payload of all other requests MUST be in either JSON
   encoding or one of the encodings advertised as being accepted in a
   Hello response from the Service.  Services MUST accept JSON encoding
   and MAY support the JSON-B or JSON-C encodings as specified in this



Hallam-Baker              Expires 19 July 2020                 [Page 11]

   document.  Services MUST generate a response that is compatible with
   the DARE Message Content-Type specified in the request.

   JSON was originally developed to provide a serialization format for
   the JavaScript programming language [ECMA-262].  While this approach
   is generally applicable to the type systems of scripting programming
   languages, it is less well matched to the richer type systems of
   modern object oriented programming languages such as Java and C#.

   Working within a subset of the capabilities of JSON allows a Web
   Service protocol to be accessed with equal ease from either platform
   type.  The following capabilities of JSON are avoided:

   The ability to use arbitrary strings as field names.

   The use of JSON objects to define maps directly

   The following data field types are used:

   Integer  Integer values are encoded as JSON number values.

   String  Test strings are encoded as JSON text strings.

   Boolean  Boolean values are encoded as JSON 'false', 'true' or 'null'
      tokens according to value.

   Sequence  Sequences of data items that are encoded as JSON arrays

   Object of known type  Objects whose type is known to the receiver are
      encoded as JSON objects

   Object of variable type  Objects whose type is not known to the
      receiver are encoded as JSON objects containing a single field
      whose name describes the type of the object value and whose value
      contains the value.

   Binary Data  Byte sequences are converted to BASE64-url encoding
      [RFC4648] and encoded as JSON string values.

   Date Time  Date Time values are converted to Internet time format as
      described in [RFC3339] and encoded as JSON string values.

4.5.  Error handling and response codes

   It is possible for an error to occur at any of the three layers in
   the Web Service binding:

   Service Layer



Hallam-Baker              Expires 19 July 2020                 [Page 12]

Internet-Draft           Mesh Protocol Reference            January 2020


   HTTP Layer

   Transport Layer

   Services SHOULD always attempt to return error codes at the highest
   level possible.  However, it is clearly impossible for a connection
   that is refused at the Transport layer to return an error code at the
   HTTP layer.  It is however possible for a HTTP layer error response
   to contain a content body.

   In the case that a response contains both a HTTP response code and a
   well-formed payload containing a response, the payload response SHALL
   have precedence.

5.  Service Description

   The Hello transaction is used to determine the features supported by
   the service and obtain the service credentials

6.  Account Management

   A Mesh Account is bound to a Mesh Service by completing a
   "CreateAccount" transaction with the service.

   The client requesting the account creation specifies the
   "ProfileMesh" profile describing the requested account and lists of
   initial entries to populate the devices and contacts catalogs.
   Additional catalogs MAY be synchronized if the account creation
   request is accepted.

   The request payload:

7.  Container Synchronization

   All the state associated with a Mesh profile is stored as a sequence
   of DARE Messages in a Dare Container.  The Mesh Service holding the
   master copy of the persistence stores and the devices connected to
   the profile containing complete copies (replicas) or partial copies
   (redactions).

   Thus, the only primitive needed to achieve synchronization of the
   profile state are those required for synchronization of a DARE
   Container.  These steps are:

   *  Obtain the status of the catalogs and spools associated with the
      account.

   *  Download catalog and spool updates




Hallam-Baker              Expires 19 July 2020                 [Page 16]

Internet-Draft           Mesh Protocol Reference            January 2020


   *  Upload catalog updates.

   To ensure a satisfactory user experience, Mesh Messages are
   intentionally limited in size to 64 KB or less, thus ensuring that an
   application can retrieve the most recent 100 messages almost
   instantaneously on a high bandwidth connection and without undue
   delay on a slower one.

7.1.  Status Transaction

   The status transaction returns the status of the containers the
   device is authorized to access for the specified account together
   with the updated Device Connection Entry if this has been modified
   since the entry presented to authenticate the request was issued.

7.2.  Download Transaction

   The download transaction returns a collection of entries from one or
   more containers associated with the profile.

   Optional filtering criteria MAY be specified to only return objects
   matching specific criteria and/or only return certain parts of the
   selected messages.

   The service MAY limit the number of entries returned in an individual
   response for performance reasons.

7.2.1.  Conflict Detection

   Clients SHOULD check to determine if updates to a container conflict
   with pending updates on the device waiting to be uploaded.  For
   example, if a contact that the user modified on the device attempting
   to synchronize was subsequently deleted.

   The means of resolving such conflicts is not in the scope of this
   specification.

7.2.2.  Filtering

   Clients may request container updates be filtered to redact catalog
   entries that have been updated or deleted or spool entries that have
   been read, deleted or were received before a certain date.

7.3.  Upload Transaction

   The upload transaction upload objects to a catalog or spool.

Internet-Draft           Mesh Protocol Reference            January 2020


   Multiple objects MAY be uploaded at once.  Object updates MAY be
   conditional on the successful completion of other upload requests.

   The transaction MAY be performed in one request/response round trip
   or with separate round trips to confirm that the transaction is
   accepted by the service before sending large number of updates.

8.  Device Connection

   Devices request connection to a Mesh profile using the "Connect"
   transaction.  Three connection mechanisms are currently defined.  All
   three of which offer strong mutual authentication.

   Device Authenticated

   Pin Authenticated

   EARL Connection Mode

   The first two of these mechanisms are initiated from the device being
   connected which requires that the Mesh Service Account it is being
   connected to be entered into it.  Use of these mechanisms thus
   requires keyboard and display affordances or accessibility
   equivalents.

   The last mechanism is initiated from an administration device that is
   already connected to the account.  It is intended for use in
   circumstances where the device being connected does not have the
   necessary affordances to allow the Device or PIN authenticated modes.

   In either case, the connection request is completed by the device
   requesting synchronization with the Mesh Account using its device
   credential for authentication.  If the connection request was
   accepted, the device will be provisioned with the Device Connection
   Assertion allowing it to complete the process.

   The Device Connection Assertion includes an overlay device profile
   containing a set of private key contributions to be used to perform
   key cogeneration on the original set of device keys to create a new
   device profile to be used for all purposes associated with the Mesh
   Profile to which it has just been connected.  This assures the user
   that the keys the device uses for performing operation in the context
   of their profile are not affected by any compromise that might have
   occurred during manufacture or at any point after up to the time it
   was connected to their profile.

8.1.  Device Authenticated

   The direct connection mechanism requires that both the administration
   device and the device originating the connection request have data
   entry and output affordances and that it is possible for the user to
   compare the authentication codes presented by the two devices to
   check that they are identical.

8.2.  PIN Authenticated

   The PIN Connection mechanism is similar to the Direct connection
   mechanism except that the process is initiated on an administration
   device by requesting assignment of a new authentication PIN.  The PIN
   is then input to the connecting device to authenticate the request.

8.3.  EARL connection mode

   The EARL/QR code connection mechanisms are used to connect a
   constrained device to a Mesh profile by means of an Encrypted
   Authenticated Resource Locator, typically presented as a QR code on
   the device itself or its packaging.

9.  Mesh Messaging

   Mesh Messages provide a means of communication between Mesh Service
   Accounts with capabilities that are not possible or poorly supported
   in traditional SMTP mail messaging:

   *  End-to-end confidentiality and authentication by default.

   *  Abuse mitigation by applying access control to every inbound and
      outbound message.

   *  End-to-end secure group messaging.

   *  Transfer of very large data sets (Terabytes).

   Note that although Mesh Messaging is designed to facilitate the
   transfer of very large data sets, the size of Mesh Messages
   themselves is severely restricted.  The current default maximum size
   being 64 KB.  This approach allows Mesh

   In addition, the platform anticipates but does not currently support
   additional cryptographic security capabilities:

   *  Traffic analysis resistance using mix networks (Chaum).

Internet-Draft           Mesh Protocol Reference            January 2020


   *  Simultaneous contract binding using fair contract signing
      (Micali).

   While these capabilities might in time cause Mesh Messaging to
   replace SMTP, this is not a near term goal.  The short-term goal of
   Mesh Messaging is to support the Contact Exchange and Confirmation
   applications.

   Two important classes of application that are not currently supported
   directly are payments and presence.  While prototypes of these
   applications have been considered, it is not clear if these are best
   implemented as special cases of the Confirmation and Contact Exchange
   applications or as separate applications in their own right.

9.1.  Message Exchange

   To enable effective abuse mitigation, Mesh Messaging enforces a four
   corner communication model in which all outbound and inbound messages
   pass through a Mesh Service which accredits and authorizes the
   messages on the user's behalf.

   (Artwork only available as svg: No external link available, see
   draft-hallambaker-mesh-protocol-04.html for artwork.)

                                  Figure 1

   The Post transaction is used for client-service and service-service
   messaging transactions.

9.1.1.  Client-Service (Post Transaction)

   To send a message, the client creates the Mesh Message structure,
   encapsulates it in a DARE Message and forwards this to its service
   using a "Post" transaction.

   The Post transaction is authenticated to the service by device using
   the usual means of profile or ticket authentication.

   The DARE Message MUST be signed under a device signature key
   accredited by a Device Connection Assertion provided in the message
   signature block.

9.1.2.  Service-Service (Post Transaction)

   The Mesh Service receiving the message from the user's device MAY
   attempt immediate retransmission or queue it to be sent at a future
   time.  Mesh Services SHOULD forward messages without undue delay.




Hallam-Baker              Expires 19 July 2020                 [Page 20]

Internet-Draft           Mesh Protocol Reference            January 2020


   The Post transaction forwarding the message to the destination
   service carries the same payload as the original request but is
   authenticated by the service forwarding it.  This authentication MAY
   be my means of either profile or ticket authentication.

9.1.2.1.  Denial of Service Mitigation

   Services SHOULD implement Denial of Service mitigation strategies
   including limiting the maximum time taken to complete a transaction
   and refusing connections from clients that engage in patterns of
   behavior consistent with abuse.

   The limitation in message size allows Mesh Services to aggressively
   time out connections that take too long to complete a transaction.  A
   Mesh Service that hosted on a 10Mb/s link should be able to transfer
   20 messages a second.  If the service is taking more than 5 seconds
   to complete a transaction, either the source or the destination
   service is overloaded or the message itself is an attack.

   Imposing hard constraints on Mesh Service performance requires
   deployments to scale and apply resources appropriately.  If a service
   is attempting to transfer 100 messages simultaneously and 40% are
   taking 4 seconds or more, this indicates that the number of
   simultaneous transfers being attempted should be reduced.
   Contrawise, if 90% are completinin less than a second, the number of
   threads allocated to sending outbound messages might be increased.

9.1.2.2.  Access Control

   The inbound service MUST subject inbound messages to Access Control
   according to the credentials presented in the DARE Message payload.

   After verifying the signature and checking that the key is properly
   accredited in accordance with site policy, the service applies
   authorization controls taking account of:

   *  The accreditation of the sender

   *  The accreditation of the transmitting Service

   *  The type of Mesh Message being sent

   *  User policy as specified in their Contact Catalog

   *  Site policy.

9.1.3.  Service-Client (Synchronization)

   The final recipient receives the message by synchronizing their
   inbound spool.

10.  Protocol Schema

   HTTP Well Known Service Prefix: /.well-known/mmm  

   Every Mesh Portal Service transaction consists of exactly one request
   followed by exactly one response.  Mesh Service transactions MAY
   cause modification of the data stored in the Mesh Service or the Mesh
   itself but do not cause changes to the connection state.  The
   protocol itself is thus idempotent.  There is no set sequence in
   which operations are required to be performed.  It is not necessary
   to perform a Hello transaction prior to any other transaction.

10.1.  Request Messages

   A Mesh Portal Service request consists of a payload object that
   inherits from the MeshRequest class.  When using the HTTP binding,
   the request MUST specify the portal DNS address in the HTTP Host
   field.

10.1.1.  Message: MeshRequest

   Base class for all request messages.

   [No fields]

10.1.2.  Message: MeshRequestUser

   Base class for all request messages made by a user.

   Inherits: MeshRequest  

   Account: String (Optional)  The fully qualified account name
      (including DNS address) to which the request is directed.

   DeviceProfile: DareEnvelope (Optional)  Device profile of the device
      making the request.

Internet-Draft           Mesh Protocol Reference            January 2020


10.2.  Response Messages

   A Mesh Portal Service response consists of a payload object that
   inherits from the MeshResponse class.  When using the HTTP binding,
   the response SHOULD report the Status response code in the HTTP
   response message.  However the response code returned in the payload
   object MUST always be considered authoritative.

10.2.1.  Message: MeshResponse

   Base class for all response messages.  Contains only the status code
   and status description fields.

   [No fields]

10.3.  Imported Objects
