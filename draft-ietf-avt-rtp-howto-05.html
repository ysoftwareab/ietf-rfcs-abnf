Introduction</h3>

<p><a class='info' href='#RFC3550'>RTP<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., Casner, S., Frederick, R., and V. Jacobson, &ldquo;RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3550] payload formats define how a
      specific real-time data format is structured in the payload of an RTP
      packet. A real-time data format without a payload format specification
      can't be transported using RTP. This creates an interest from many
      individuals/organizations with media encoders or other types of
      real-time data to define RTP payload formats. The specification of a
      well designed RTP payload format is non-trivial and requires knowledge
      of both RTP and the real-time data format.
</p>
<p>This document intends to help any author of an RTP payload format to
      make important design decisions, consider important features of RTP,
      security, etc. The document is also intended to be a good starting point
      for any person with little experience in IETF and/or RTP to learn the
      necessary steps.
</p>
<p>This document extends and updates the information that are available
      in <a class='info' href='#RFC2736'>"Guidelines for Writers of RTP Payload Format
      Specifications"<span> (</span><span class='info'>Handley, M. and C. Perkins, &ldquo;Guidelines for Writers of RTP Payload Format Specifications,&rdquo; December&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2736]. Since this RFC was written further experience
      has been gained on the design and specification of RTP payload format.
      Several new RTP profiles, and robustness tools has also been defined,
      which needs to be considered.
</p>
<p>We also discuss the possible venues of defining an RTP payload
      format, in IETF, by other standard bodies and proprietary ones.
      Independent on the intended venue of specification, all will gain from
      this document.

<a name="rfc.section.1.1"></a><h3>1.1.&nbsp;
Structure</h3>

<p>This document has several different parts discussing different
        aspects of the creation of an RTP payload format specification. After
        the introduction and definitions there are a section discussing the
        preparations the author(s) should do before start writing. The
        following section discusses the different processes used when
        specifying and completing an payload format, with focus on working
        inside the IETF. Section 5 discusses the design of payload formats
        themselves in detail. Section 6 discusses the current design trends
        and provides good examples of practices that should be followed when
        applicable. Following that there is a discussion on important sections
        in the RTP payload format specification itself, like security and IANA
        considerations. This document ends with an appendix containing an
        template that can be used when writing RTP payload formats.

Preparations</h3>

<p>RTP is a complex real-time media delivery framework and it has a lot
      of details to consider when writing an RTP payload format. There is also
      important to have a good understanding of the media codec/format so that
      all its important features and properties are considered. First when one
      has sufficient understanding of both parts can one produce an RTP
      payload format of high quality. On top of this, one needs to understand
      the process within IETF and especially the AVT WG to quickly go from
      initial idea to a finished RFC. This and the next section helps an
      author prepare himself in those regards.

        needs to be aware of everything listed below.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1.1"></a><h3>3.1.1.&nbsp;
IETF Process and Publication</h3>

<p>For newcomers to IETF it is strongly recommended that one reads
          the <a class='info' href='#RFC4677'>"Tao of the IETF"<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hoffman, P. and S. Harris, &ldquo;The Tao of IETF - A Novice's Guide to the Internet Engineering Task Force,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4677] that goes
          through most things that one needs to know about the IETF. It
          contains information about history, organisational structure, how
          the WG and meetings work and many more details.
</p>
<p>The main part of the IETF process is defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC2026'>RFC 2026<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bradner, S., &ldquo;The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1996.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2026]. In addition an author needs to
          understands the IETF rules and rights associated with copyright and
          IPR documented in <a class='info' href='#RFC3978'>BCP 78<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bradner, S., &ldquo;IETF Rights in Contributions,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3978] and <a class='info' href='#RFC3979'>BCP 79<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bradner, S., &ldquo;Intellectual Property Rights in IETF Technology,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3979]. <a class='info' href='#RFC2418'>RFC
          2418<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bradner, S., &ldquo;IETF Working Group Guidelines and Procedures,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2418] describes the WG process, the relation between the IESG
          and the WG, and the responsibilities of WG chairs and
          participants.
</p>
<p>It is important to note that the RFC series contains documents of
          several different classifications; standards track, informational,
          experimental, best current practice (BCP), and historic. The
          standard tracks contains documents of three different maturity
          classifications, proposed, draft and Internet Standard. A standards
          track document must start as proposed, after proved interoperability
          of all the features it can be moved to draft standard, and final
          when further experience has been gathered it can be moved to
          Internet standard. As the content of the RFCs are not allowed to be
          changed, the only way of updating an RFC is to write and publish a
          new one that either updates or replaces the old one. Therefore it is
          important to both consider the Category field in the header and
          check if the RFC one is reading or going to reference is the latest
          and valid. One way of checking the current status of an RFC is to
          use the RFC-editor's RFC search engine, which displays the current
          status and which if any RFCs that updates or obsolete it.
</p>
<p>Before starting to write an draft one should also read the
          Internet Draft writing guidelines
          (http://www.ietf.org/ietf/1id-guidelines.txt), the ID checklist
          (http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html) and the <a class='info' href='#RFC-ED'>RFC editorial guidelines and procedures<span> (</span><span class='info'>http://www.rfc-editor.org/policy.html, &ldquo;RFC Editorial Guidelines and Procedures,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC&#8209;ED].
          Another document that can be useful is the <a class='info' href='#RFC2360'>"Guide for Internet Standards Writers"<span> (</span><span class='info'>Scott, G., &ldquo;Guide for Internet Standards Writers,&rdquo; June&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2360].
</p>
<p>There are also a number of documents to consider in process of
          writing of drafts intended to become RFCs. These are important when
          writing certain type of text. </p>

RTP</h3>

<p>The recommended reading for RTP consist of several different
          parts; design guidelines, the RTP protocol, profiles, robustness
          tools, and media specific recommendations.
</p>
<p>Any author of RTP payload formats should start with reading <a class='info' href='#RFC2736'>RFC 2736<span> (</span><span class='info'>Handley, M. and C. Perkins, &ldquo;Guidelines for Writers of RTP Payload Format Specifications,&rdquo; December&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2736] which contains an introduction to
          the application layer framing (ALF) principle, the channel
          characteristics of IP channels, and design guidelines for RTP
          payload formats. The goal of ALF is to be able to transmit
          Application Data Units (ADUs) that are independently usable by the
          receiver in individual RTP packets. Thus minimizing dependencies
          between RTP packets and the effects of packet loss.
</p>
<p>Then it is suitable to learn more about the RTP protocol, by
          studying the RTP specification <a class='info' href='#RFC3550'>RFC
          3550<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., Casner, S., Frederick, R., and V. Jacobson, &ldquo;RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3550] and the existing profiles. As a complement to the
          standards document there exist a book totally dedicated to <a class='info' href='#CSP-RTP'>RTP<span> (</span><span class='info'>Colin , &ldquo;RTP: Audio and Video for the Internet,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> [CSP&#8209;RTP]. There exist several profiles for RTP
          today, but all are based on the <a class='info' href='#RFC3551'>"RTP Profile
          for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control" (RFC
          3551)<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H. and S. Casner, &ldquo;RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3551] (abbreviated AVP). The other profiles that one should
          known about are <a class='info' href='#RFC3711'>Secure RTP (SAVP)<span> (</span><span class='info'>Baugher, M., McGrew, D., Naslund, M., Carrara, E., and K. Norrman, &ldquo;The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3711],
          <a class='info' href='#RFC4585'>"Extended RTP Profile for RTCP-based
          Feedback"<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ott, J., Wenger, S., Sato, N., Burmeister, C., and J. Rey, &ldquo;Extended RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/AVPF),&rdquo; July&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4585] and <a class='info' href='#RFC5124'>"Extended Secure RTP
          Profile for RTCP-based Feedback (RTP/SAVPF)"<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ott, J. and E. Carrara, &ldquo;Extended Secure RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/SAVPF),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC5124]. It is important
          to understand RTP and the AVP profile in detail. For the other
          profiles it is sufficient to have an understanding on what
          functionality they provided and the limitations they create.
</p>
<p>There has been developed a number of robustness tools for RTP.
          The tools are for different use cases and real-time requirements.
          </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>RFC 2198:</dt>
<dd>The <a class='info' href='#RFC2198'>"RTP Payload
              for Redundant Audio Data"<span> (</span><span class='info'>Perkins, C., Kouvelas, I., Hodson, O., Hardman, V., Handley, M., Bolot, J., Vega-Garcia, A., and S. Fosse-Parisis, &ldquo;RTP Payload for Redundant Audio Data,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1997.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2198] provides functionalities to
              provided redundant copies of audio or text payloads. These
              redundant copies are sent together with an primary format in the
              same RTP payload. This format relies on the RTP timestamp to
              determine where data belongs in a sequence and therefore is
              usually primarily suitable to be used with audio. However also
              the <a class='info' href='#RFC4103'>RTP Payload format for T.140<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hellstrom, G. and P. Jones, &ldquo;RTP Payload for Text Conversation,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4103]
              text format uses this format. The formats major property is that
              it only preserves the timestamp of the redundant payloads, not
              the original sequence number. Thus making it unusable for most
              video formats. This format is also only suitable for media
              formats that produce relatively small RTP payloads.
</dd>
<dt>RFC 5109:</dt>
<dd>The "RTP Payload Format for Generic
              Forward Error Correction" <a class='info' href='#RFC5109'>[RFC5109]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Li, A., &ldquo;RTP Payload Format for Generic Forward Error Correction,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>
              provides an XOR based FEC of the whole or parts of a the packets
              for a number of RTP packets. These FEC packets are sent in a
              separate stream or as a redundant encoding using RFC 2198. This
              FEC scheme has certain restrictions in the number of packets it
              can protect. It is suitable for low to medium delay tolerant
              applications with limited amount of RTP packets.
</dd>
<dt>RTP Retransmission:</dt>
<dd>The <a class='info' href='#RFC4588'>RTP

              most important RTP packets in a media stream. The scheme is not
              intended, nor suitable, to provide full reliability. It requires
              the application to be quite delay tolerant as a minimum of one
              round-trip time plus processing delay is required to perform an
              retransmission. Thus it is mostly suitable for streaming
              applications but may also be usable in certain other cases when
              operating on networks with short round trip times (RTT).
</dd>
<dt>RTP over TCP:</dt>
<dd>RFC 4571 <a class='info' href='#RFC4571'>[RFC4571]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Lazzaro, J., &ldquo;Framing Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Packets over Connection-Oriented Transport,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> defines how one sends RTP and RTCP
              packet over connection oriented transports like TCP. If one uses
              TCP one gets reliability for all packets but loose some of the
              real-time behavior that RTP was designed to provide. Issues with
              TCP transport of real-time media include head of line blocking
              and wasting resources on retransmission of already late data.
              TCP is also limited to point-to-point connections which further
              restricts its applicability.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>There has also been discussion and also design of RTP payload
          formats, e.g AMR and AMR-WB<a class='info' href='#RFC4867'>[RFC4867]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Sjoberg, J., Westerlund, M., Lakaniemi, A., and Q. Xie, &ldquo;RTP Payload Format and File Storage Format for the Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR) and Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband (AMR-WB) Audio Codecs,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>,
          supporting the unequal error detection provided by UDP-Lite <a class='info' href='#RFC3828'>[RFC3828]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Larzon, L-A., Degermark, M., Pink, S., Jonsson, L-E., and G. Fairhurst, &ldquo;The Lightweight User Datagram Protocol (UDP-Lite),&rdquo; July&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>. The idea is that by not having a checksum
          over part of the RTP payload one can allow bit-errors from the lower
          layers. By allowing bit-errors one can increase the efficiency of
          some link layers, and also avoid unnecessary discards of data when
          the payload and media codec could get at least some utility from the
          data. The main issue is that one has no idea on the level of
          bit-errors present in the unprotected part of the payload. Which
          makes it hard or impossible to determine if one can design something
          usable or not. Payload format designers are recommended against
          considering features for unequal error detection unless very clear
          requirements exist.

<p>There exist a couple of different security mechanisms that may be
          used with RTP. All generic mechanisms need to be transparent for the
          RTP payload format and nothing that needs special consideration. The
          main reason that there exist different solutions is that different
          applications have different requirements thus different solutions
          have been developed. The main properties for a RTP security
          mechanism are to provide confidentiality for the RTP payload,
          integrity protection to detect manipulation of payload and headers,
          and source authentication. Not all mechanism provides all of these
          features which will need to be considered when used.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2.1"></a><h3>3.2.1.&nbsp;
The RTP Session</h3>

<p>The definition of the RTP session from RFC 3550 is:
</p>
<p>"An association among a set of participants communicating with
          RTP. A participant may be involved in multiple RTP sessions at the
          same time. In a multimedia session, each medium is typically carried
          in a separate RTP session with its own RTCP packets unless the
          encoding itself multiplexes multiple media into a single data
          stream. A participant distinguishes multiple RTP sessions by
          reception of different sessions using different pairs of destination
          transport addresses, where a pair of transport addresses comprises
          one network address plus a pair of ports for RTP and RTCP. All
          participants in an RTP session may share a common destination
          transport address pair, as in the case of IP multicast, or the pairs
          may be different for each participant, as in the case of individual
          unicast network addresses and port pairs. In the unicast case, a
          participant may receive from all other participants in the session
          using the same pair of ports, or may use a distinct pair of ports
          for each.
</p>
<p>The distinguishing feature of an RTP session is that each
          maintains a full, separate space of SSRC identifiers (defined next).
          The set of participants included in one RTP session consists of
          those that can receive an SSRC identifier transmitted by any one of
          the participants either in RTP as the SSRC or a CSRC (also defined
          below) or in RTCP. For example, consider a three-party conference
          implemented using unicast UDP with each participant receiving from
          the other two on separate port pairs. If each participant sends RTCP
          feedback about data received from one other participant only back to
          that participant, then the conference is composed of three separate
          point-to-point RTP sessions. If each participant provides RTCP
          feedback about its reception of one other participant to both of the
          other participants, then the conference is composed of one
          multi-party RTP session. The latter case simulates the behavior that
          would occur with IP multicast communication among the three
          participants.
</p>
<p>The RTP framework allows the variations defined here, but a
          particular control protocol or application design will usually
          impose constraints on these variations."

RTP Header</h3>

<p>The RTP header contains two fields that require additional
          specification by the RTP payload format, namely the RTP Timestamp
          and the marker bit. Certain RTP payload formats also uses the RTP
          sequence number to realize certain functionalities. The payload type
          is used to indicate the used payload format.
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Marker bit:</dt>
<dd>A single bit normally used to provide
              important indications. In audio it is normally used to indicate
              the start of an talk burst. This to enable jitter buffer
              adaptation prior to this with minimal audio quality impact. In
              video the marker bit is normally used to indicate the last
              packet part of an frame. This enables an decoder to finish
              decoding the picture, where it otherwise may need to wait for
              the next packet to explicitly know that.
</dd>
<dt>Timestamp:</dt>
<dd>The RTP timestamp indicate the time
              instance the media belongs to. For discrete media, like video it
              normally indicates when the media (frame) was sampled. For
              continuous media it normally indicates the first time instance
              the media present in the payload represents. For audio this is
              the sampling time of the first sample. All RTP payload formats
              must specify the meaning of the timestamp value and which clock
              rates that are allowed. Note that clock rates below 1000 Hz is
              not appropriate due to RTCP measurements function that in that
              case lose resolution.
</dd>
<dt>Sequence number:</dt>
<dd>The sequence number are
              monotonically increasing and set as packets are sent. That
              property is used in many payload formats to recover the order of
              everything from the whole stream down to fragments of ADUs and
              the order they shall be decoded.
</dd>
<dt>Payload Type:</dt>
<dd>Commonly the same payload type is
              used for a media stream for the whole duration of a session.
              However in some cases it may be required to change the payload
              format or its configuration during the session. The payload type
              is used to indicate on a per packet basis which format is used.
              Thus certain major configuration information can be bound to a
              payload type value by out-of-band signalling. Examples of this
              would be video decoder configuration information.
</dd>
<dt>SSRC:</dt>
<dd>The Sender Source ID is normally not used by
              a payload format other than identifying the RTP timestamp and
              sequence number space a packet belongs to, allowing the
              simultaneously reception of multiple senders. However there are
              certain of the mechanisms the make RTP robuster that are RTP
              payloads that have used multiple SSRCs and bound them together
              to correctly separate original data and repair or redundant
              data.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote><p>The remaining fields are commonly not influencing the RTP
          payload format. The padding bit is worth clarifying as it indicates
          that one or more bytes are appended after the RTP payload. This
          padding must be removed by a receiver before payload format
          processing can occur. Thus it is completely separate from any
          padding that may occur within the payload format itself.

RTP Multiplexing</h3>

<p>RTP has three multiplexing points that are used for different
          purposes. A proper understanding of this is important to correctly
          utilized them.
</p>
<p>The first one is separation of media streams of different types,
          which is accomplished using different RTP sessions. So for example
          in the common multi-media session with audio and video, RTP
          multiplex audio and video on different RTP sessions. To achieve this
          separation, transport level functionalities are use, normally UDP
          port numbers. Different RTP sessions are also used to realize
          layered scalability as it allows a receiver to select one or more
          layers for multicasted RTP sessions simply by joining the multicast
          groups the desired layers are transported over. This also allows
          different Quality of Service (QoS) be applied to different
          media.
</p>
<p>The next point is separation of different sources within a RTP
          session. Here RTP uses the SSRC (Sender Source) which identifies
          individual sources. An example of individual sources in audio RTP
          session, would be different microphones, independent of if they are
          from the same host or different hosts. For each SSRC a unique RTP
          sequence number and timestamp space is used.
</p>
<p>The third multiplexing point is the RTP headers payload type
          field. The payload type identifies what format the content in the
          RTP payload has. This includes different payload format
          configurations, different codecs, and also usage of robustness
          mechanisms like the one described in <a class='info' href='#RFC2198'>RFC
          2198<span> (</span><span class='info'>Perkins, C., Kouvelas, I., Hodson, O., Hardman, V., Handley, M., Bolot, J., Vega-Garcia, A., and S. Fosse-Parisis, &ldquo;RTP Payload for Redundant Audio Data,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1997.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2198].

RTP Synchronization</h3>

<p>There are several types of synchronization and we will here
          describe how RTP handles the different types:</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Intra media:</dt>
<dd>The synchronization within a media
              stream from a source is accomplished using the RTP timestamp
              field. Each RTP packet carry the RTP timestamp that specifies
              the media contained in this packets position in relation to
              other media on the time line. This is especially useful in cases
              of discontinues transmissions. Discontinues can also be caused
              by the network and with extensive losses the RTP timestamp tells
              the receiver how much later than previously received media the
              media shall be played out.
</dd>
<dt>Inter media:</dt>
<dd>As applications commonly has a desire
              to use several media types at the same time there exist a need
              to synchronize also the different medias from the same source.
              This puts two requirements on RTP; possibility to determine
              which media is from the same source and if they should be
              synchronized with each other; and the functionality to
              facilitate the synchronization itself.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>The first part of Inter media synchronization is to determine
          which SSRCs in each session that should be synchronized with each
          other. This is accomplished by comparing the RTCP SDES CNAME field.
          SSRCs with the same CNAME in different RTP session should be
          synchronized.
</p>
<p>The actual RTCP mechanism for inter media synchronization is
          based on that each media stream provide a position on the media
          specific time line (measured in RTP timestamp ticks) and a common
          reference time line. The common reference time line is in RTCP
          expressed as an wall clock time in the Network Time Protocol (NTP)
          format. It is important to notice that the wall clock time is not
          required to be synchronized between hosts, for example by using
          <a class='info' href='#RFC1305'>NTP<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mills, D., &ldquo;Network Time Protocol (Version 3) Specification, Implementation,&rdquo; March&nbsp;1992.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC1305] . It can even have nothing at all
          to do with the actual time, for example the host system's uptime can
          be used for this purpose. The important factor is that all media
          streams from a particular source that are being synchronized uses
          the same reference clock to derive there relative RTP timestamp time
          scales.
</p>
<p>In <a class='info' href='#rtcp-synch'>the below
          Figure<span> (</span><span class='info'>RTCP Synchronization</span><span>)</span></a> it is depicted how if one receives RTCP Sender Report
          (SR) packet P1 in one media stream and RTCP SR packet P2 in the
          other session, then one can calculate the corresponding RTP
          timestamp values for any arbitrary point in time T. However to be
          able to do that it is also required to know the RTP timestamp rates
          for each media currently used in the sessions

<p>Lets assume that media 1 uses a RTP Timestamp clock rate of 16
          kHz, and media 2 a rate of 90 kHz. Then the TS1 and TS2 for point T
          can be calculated in the following way: TS1(T) = TS1(P1) + 16000 *
          (NTP(T)-NTP(P1)) and TS2(T) = TS2(P2) + 90000 * (NTP(T)-NTP(P2)).
          This calculation is useful as it allows to generate a common
          synchronization point for which all time values are provided
          (TS1(T), TS2(T) and T). So when one like to calculate at which NTP
          time the TS present in packet X corresponds to one can do that in
          the following way: NTP(X) = NTP(T) + (TS2(X) - TS2(T))/90000.

Signalling Aspects</h3>

<p>RTP payload formats are used in the context of application
        signalling protocols such as <a class='info' href='#RFC3261'>SIP<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Schulzrinne, H., Camarillo, G., Johnston, A., Peterson, J., Sparks, R., Handley, M., and E.

        <a class='info' href='#RFC4566'>SDP<span> (</span><span class='info'>Handley, M., Jacobson, V., and C. Perkins, &ldquo;SDP: Session Description Protocol,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4566] with <a class='info' href='#RFC3264'>Offer/Answer<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J. and H. Schulzrinne, &ldquo;An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP),&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3264], <a class='info' href='#RFC2326'>RTSP<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., Rao, A., and R. Lanphier, &ldquo;Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP),&rdquo; April&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2326] or <a class='info' href='#RFC2326'>SAP<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., Rao, A., and R. Lanphier, &ldquo;Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP),&rdquo; April&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2326].
        These examples all uses SDP to indicate which and how many media
        streams that are desired to be used in the session and their
        configuration. To be able to declare or negotiate which media format
        and RTP payload packetization the payload format must be given an
        identifier. In addition to the identifier many payload formats also
        have the need to carry further configuration information out-of-band
        in regards to the RTP payloads prior to the media transport
        session.
</p>
<p>The above examples of session establishing protocols all use SDP,
        however also other session description formats may be used. For
        example there have been discussion on a new Session Description format
        within IETF (SDP-NG). To prevent locking the usage of RTP to SDP based
        out-of-band signalling, the payload formats are identified using an
        separate definition format for the identifier and parameters. That
        format is the Media Type.

          arbitrary content carried within the protocols. Media types also
          provide a media hierarchy that fits RTP payload formats well. Media
          type names are two-part and consist of content type and sub-type
          separated with a slash, e.g. "audio/PCMA" or "video/h263-2000". It
          is important to choose the correct content-type when creating the
          media type identifying an RTP payload format. However in most cases
          there is little doubt what content type the format belongs to.
          Guidelines for choosing the correct media type and registration
          rules are present in <a class='info' href='#RFC4288'>RFC 4288<span> (</span><span class='info'>Freed, N. and J. Klensin, &ldquo;Media Type Specifications and Registration Procedures,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4288]. The

<p>Media types are allowed any number of parameters which are
          divided into two groups, required and optional parameters. They are
          always on the form name=value. There exist no restriction on how the

          parameters must have value. However the carrying of media types in
          SDP etc. has resulted in the following restrictions that needs to be
          followed to make media types for RTP payload format usable:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">

              message. Thus parameter values that are continuous and non
              interrupted by common text separators, such as space and
              semi-colon are recommended. If that is not possible some type of
              escaping should be used. Usage of " (double quote) is
              recommended.
</li>
<li>A common representation form of the media type and its
              parameters is on a single line. In those cases the media type is
              followed by a semi-colon separated list of the parameter value
              pair, e.g. audio/amr octet-align=0; mode-set=0,2,5,7;
              mode-change-period=2.

Mapping to SDP</h3>

<a name="rfc.section.3.3.2.1"></a><h3>3.3.2.1.&nbsp;
The Offer/Answer Model</h3>

<p>The Offer/Answer (O/A) model allows SIP to negotiate media
            formats and which payload formats and their configuration is used
            in a session. However O/A does not define a default behavior and
            instead points out the need to define how parameters behave. To
            make things even more complex the direction of media within a
            session do have impact on these rules, thus some cases may require
            description separately for peers that are send only, receiver only
            or both senders and receivers as identified by the SDP attributes
            a=sendonly, a=recvonly, and a=sendrecv. In addition any usage of
            multicast puts a further limitations as the same media stream is
            delivered to all participants. If those restrictions are to
            limiting also to be used in unicast then separate rules for
            unicast and multicast will be required.
</p>
<p>The most common O/A interpretation and the simplest is for
            declarative parameters, i.e. the sending entity can declare a
            value and that has no direct impact on the other agents values.
            This declared value applies to all media that are going to be sent
            to the declaring entity. For example most video codecs has level
            parameter which tells the other participants the highest
            complexity the video decoder supports. The level parameter can be
            declared independently by two participants in a unicast session as
            it will be the media sender responsibility to transmit a video
            stream that fulfills the limitation the other has declared.
            However in multicast it will be necessary to send a stream that
            follows the limitation of the weakest receiver, i.e. the one that
            has supports the lowest level. To simplify the negotiation in
            these cases it is common to require any answerer to a multicast
            session to take a yes or no approach to parameters.
</p>
<p>"Negotiated" parameters are another type of parameters, for
            which both sides needs to agree on their values. Such parameter
            requires that the answerer either accept as they are offered or
            remove the payload type the parameter belonged to. The removal of
            the payload type from the answer indicates to the offerer the lack
            of support. An unfortunate implications of the need to use
            complete payload types to indicate each configuration possible to
            achieve interoperability, is that the number of payload types
            necessary can quickly grow big. This is one reason to keep the
            total number of set of capabilities that may be implemented
            limited.
</p>
<p>The most problematic type of parameters are those that relates
            with the transmission the entity performs. They do not really fit
            the O/A model but can be shoe-horned in. Example of such
            parameters can be found in the <a class='info' href='#RFC3984'>H.264 video
            code's payload format<span> (</span><span class='info'>Wenger, S., Hannuksela, M., Stockhammer, T., Westerlund, M., and D. Singer, &ldquo;RTP Payload Format for H.264 Video,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3984], where the name of all parameters
            with this property starts sprop-. The issue that exist is that
            they declare properties for a media stream one don't yet know if
            the other party accept. The best one can make of the situation is
            to explain the assumption that the other party will accept the
            same reception parameter as the offerer of the session. If the
            answerer needs to change any declarative parameter then the
            offerer may be required to make an new offer to update the
            parameter values for its outgoing media stream.
</p>
<p>Another issue to consider is the sendonly media streams in
            offers. For all parameters that relates to what one accepts to
            receive those don't have any meaning other than provide a template
            for the answering entity. It is worth pointing out in the
            specification that these provides recommended set of parameter
            values by the sender. Note that sendonly streams in answers will
            need to indicate the offerers parameters to ensure that the
            offerer can match the answer to the offer.
</p>
<p>A further issue with offer/answer which complicates things is
            that it is allowed to renumber the payload types between offer and
            answer. This is not recommended but allowed for support of
            gateways to the ITU conferencing suit. Which means that answers
            for payload types needs to be possible to bind to the ones in the
            offer even when the payload type number has been changed, and some
            of the proposed payload types have been removed. This must
            normally be done based on configurations offered, thus negotiated
            parameters becomes vital.

Declarative usage in RTSP and SAP</h3>

<p><a class='info' href='#RFC2974'>SAP (Session Announcement

            Independently of the usage of <a class='info' href='#RFC3569'>Source
            Specific Multicast (SSM)<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bhattacharyya, S., &ldquo;An Overview of Source-Specific Multicast (SSM),&rdquo; July&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3569] or Any-Source Multicast (ASM), the
            SDP provided by SAP applies to all participants. All media that is
            sent to the session must follow the media stream definition as
            specified by the SDP. Thus enabling everyone to receive the
            session if they support the configuration. Here SDP provides a one
            way channel with no possibility to affect the configuration
            defined by SDP that the session creator has decided upon. Any RTP
            Payload format that requires parameters for the send direction and
            which needs individual values per implementation or instance will
            fail in a SAP session for a multicast session allowing anyone to
            send.
</p>
<p><a class='info' href='#RFC2326'>Real-Time Streaming Protocol
            (RTSP)<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., Rao, A., and R. Lanphier, &ldquo;Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP),&rdquo; April&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2326] allows the negotiation of transport parameters for
            media streams part of a streaming session between a server and
            client. RTSP has divided the transport parameters from the media
            configuration. SDP is commonly used for media configuration in
            RTSP and is sent to the client prior to session establishment,
            either through the usage of the DESCRIBE method or an out-of-band
            channel like HTTP, email etc. The SDP is used to determine which
            media streams and what formats are being used before the session
            establishment.
</p>
<p>Thus both SAP and RTSP uses SDP to configure receivers and
            senders with a predetermined configuration including the payload
            format and any of its parameters of a media stream. Thus all
            parameters are used in a declarative fashion. This can result in
            different treatment of parameters between offer/answer and
            declarative usage in RTSP and SAP. This will then need to be
            pointed out by the payload format specification.

Steps from Idea to Publication</h3>

<p>There are a number of steps that an RTP payload format should go
          through from the initial idea until it is published. This also
          documents the process that the AVT working group applies when
          working with RTP payload formats.</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Idea: Determined the need for an RTP payload format as an
              IETF specification.
</li>
<li>Initial effort: Using this document as guideline one should
              be able to get started on the work. If one's media codec doesn't
              fit any of the common design patterns or one has problems
              understanding what the most suitable way forward is, then one
              should contact the AVT working group and/or the WG chairs. The
              goal of this stage is to have an initial individual draft. This
              draft needs to focus on the introduction parts that describe the
              real-time media format and the basic idea on how to packetize
              it. All the details are not required to be filled in. However
              security chapter is not something that one should skip even
              initially. It is important to consider already from the start
              any serious security risks that needs to be solved. This step is
              completed when one has a draft that is sufficient detailed for a
              first review by the WG. The less confident one is of the
              solution, the less work should be spent on details, instead
              concentrate on the codec properties and what is required to make
              it work.
</li>
<li>Submission of first version. When one has performed the above
              one submits the draft as an individual draft. This can be done
              at any time except the 3 weeks (current deadline at the time of
              writing, consult current announcements) prior to an IETF
              meeting. When the IETF draft announcement has been sent out on
              the draft announcement list, forward it to the AVT WG and
              request that it is reviewed. In the email outline any issues the
              authors currently have with the design.
</li>
<li>Iterative improvements: Taking the feedback into account one
              updates the draft and try resolve any issues. New revision of
              the draft can be submitted at any time. It is recommended to do
              it whenever one has made major updates or have new issues that
              are easiest to discuss in the context of a new draft
              version.
</li>
<li>Becoming WG document: Due to that the definition of RTP
              payload formats are part of the AVT's charter, RTP payload
              formats that are going to be published as standards track RFCs
              needs to become WG documents. Becoming WG document means that
              the chairs are responsible for administrative handling, like
              publication requests. However be aware that making a document
              into a WG document changes the formal ownership and
              responsibility from the individual authors to the WG. The
              initial authors will continue being document editor, unless
              unusual circumstances occur. The AVT WG accepts new RTP payload
              formats based on their suitability and document maturity. The
              document maturity is a requirement to ensure that there are
              dedicated document editors and that there exist a good
              solution.
</li>
<li>Iterative improvements: The updates and review cycles
              continues until the draft the has reached the maturity suitable
              for publication.
</li>
<li>WG last call: WG last call of at least 2 weeks are always
              performed for payload formats in the AVT WG. The authors request
              WG last call for a draft when they think it i mature enough for
              publication. The chairs perform a review to check if they agree
              with the authors assessment. If the chairs agree on the
              maturity, the WG last call is announced on the WG mailing list.
              If there are issues raised these needs to be addressed with an
              updated draft version. For any more substantial updates of
              draft, a new WG last call is announced for the updated version.
              Minor changes, like editorial on can be progressed without an
              additional WG last call.
</li>
<li>Publication Requested: For WG documents the chairs request
              publication of the draft. After this the approval and
              publication process described in <a class='info' href='#RFC2026'>RFC
              2026<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bradner, S., &ldquo;The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1996.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2026] are performed. The status after the publication has
              been requested can be tracked using the IETF data tracker.
              Documents do not expire as normal after publication has been
              requested. In addition any submission of document updates
              requires the approval of WG chair(s). The authors are commonly
              asked to address comments or issues raised by the IESG. The
              authors also review the document prior to publication as an RFC
              to ensure its correctness.

WG meetings</h3>

<p>WG meetings are for discussing issues, not presentations. This
          means that most RTP payload format should never need to be discussed
          in a WG meeting. RTP payload formats that would be discussed are
          either controversial issues that failed to be resolved on the
          mailing list, or includes new design concepts worth a general
          discussion.
</p>
<p>There exist no requirement to present or discuss a draft at a WG
          meeting before it becoming published as an RFC. Thus even authors
          that lack the possibility to go to WG meetings should be able to
          successfully specify an RTP payload format in IETF. WG meetings may
          only become required if the draft get stuck in a serious debate that
          isn't easily resolved.

Draft Naming</h3>

<p>To simplify the work of the AVT WG chairs and its WG members a
          specific draft file naming convention shall be used for RTP payload
          formats. Individual submissions shall be named draft-&lt;lead author
          family name&gt;-avt-rtp-&lt;descriptive name&gt;-&lt;version&gt;.
          The WG documents shall be named according to this template:
          draft-ietf-avt-rtp-&lt;descriptive name&gt;-&lt;version&gt;. The
          inclusion of "avt" in the draft filename ensures that the search for
          "avt-" will find all AVT related drafts. Inclusion of "rtp" tells us
          that it is an RTP payload format draft. The descriptive name should
          be as short as possible while still describe what the payload format
          is for. It is recommended to use the media format or codec acronym.
          Please note that the version must start at 00 and is increased by
          one for each submission to the IETF secretary of the draft. No
          version numbers may be skipped.

How to speed up the process</h3>

<p>There a number of ways of losing a lot of time in the above
          process. This section discuss what to do and what to avoid.</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Do not only update the draft to the meeting deadline. An
              update to each meeting automatically limits the draft to 3
              updates per year. Instead ignore the meeting schedule and
              publish new versions as soon as possible.
</li>
<li>Try to avoid requesting review when people are busy, like the
              weeks before a meeting. Review should be asked at all possible
              times and it is actually more likely that people has more time
              for them directly after a meeting.
</li>
<li>Perform draft updates quickly. A common mistake is that the
              authors lets the draft slip. By performing updates to the draft
              text directly after getting resolution on an issue, speeds
              things up. This as it minimizes the delay that the author has
              direct control over. Waiting for reviews, responses from area
              directors and chairs, etc can be much harder to speed up.
</li>
<li>Failing to take the human nature into account. It happens
              that people forget or needs to be reminded about tasks. Send
              people you are waiting for a kindly reminder if things takes
              longer than expected. To avoid annoying people ask for a time
              estimate from people when they expect to fulfill the requested
              task.
</li>
<li>Not enough review. It is common that documents take a long
              time and many iterations because not enough review is performed
              in each iteration. To improve the amount of review you get on
              your own document, trade review time with other document
              authors. Make a deal with some other document authors that you
              will review his draft(s) if he reviews yours. Even inexperience
              reviewers can help with language, editorial or clarity issues.
              Try also approaching the more experienced people in the WG and
              get them to commit to a review. The WG chairs cannot, even if
              desirable, be expected to review all versions. Due to workload
              the chairs may need to concentrate on key points in a draft
              evolution, like initial submissions, if ready to become WG
              document and WG last call.

Other Standards bodies</h3>

<p>Other standard bodies may define RTP payload in their own
        specifications. When they do this they are strongly recommend to
        contact the AVT WG chairs and request review of the work. It is
        recommended that at least two review steps are performed. One early in
        the process when more fundamental issues easily can be resolved
        without abandoning a lot of effort. Then when nearing completion, but
        while still possible to update the specification as second review
        should be scheduled. In that pass the quality can be assessed and
        hopefully no updates are needed. Using this procedure can avoids both
        conflicting definitions and serious mistakes, like breaking certain
        aspects of the RTP model.
</p>
<p>RTP payload Media Types may be registered in the standards tree by
        other standard bodies. The requirements on the organization are
        outlined in the media types registration document (<a class='info' href='#RFC4855'>RFC 4855<span> (</span><span class='info'>Casner, S., &ldquo;Media Type Registration of RTP Payload Formats,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4855] and <a class='info' href='#RFC4288'>RFC

        ensures that the registration template is acceptable. To avoid last
        minute problems with these registration the registration template must
        be sent for review both to the AVT WG and the media types list
        (ietf-types@iana.org) and is something that should be included in the
        IETF reviews of the payload format specification.
</p>
<p>Registration of the RTP payload name is something that is required
        to avoid name collision in the future. Do also note that "x-" names
        are not suitable for any documented format as they have the same
        problem with name collision and can't be registered. The list of
        already registered media types can be found at IANA
        (http://www.iana.org).

Propreitary and Vendor Specific</h3>

<p>Proprietary RTP payload formats are commonly specified when the
        real-time media format is proprietary and not intended to be part of
        any standardized system. However there exist many reasons why also
        proprietary formats should be correctly documented and
        registered;</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Usage in standardized signalling environment such as SIP/SDP.
            RTP needs to be configured regarding used RTP profiles, payload
            formats and their payload types. To accomplish this there is an
            need for registered names to ensure that the names do not collide
            with other formats.
</li>
<li>Sharing with business partners. As RTP payload formats are used
            for communication, situations where business partners like to
            support one proprietary format often arises. Having a well written
            specification of the format will save time and money for both one
            selves and ones partner, as interoperability will much easier to
            accomplish.
</li>
<li>To ensure interoperability between different implementations on
            different platforms.
</li>
</ul>

<p>To avoid name collisions there is a central register keeping tracks
        of the registered Media Type names used by different RTP payload
        formats. When it comes to proprietary formats they should be
        registered in the vendors own tree. All vendor specific registrations
        uses sub-type names that start with "vnd.&lt;vendor-name&gt;". All
        names that uses names in the vendors own trees are not required to be
        registered with IANA. However registration is recommended if used at
        all in public environments.

Designing Payload Formats</h3>

<p>The best summary of payload format design is KISS (Keep It Simple,
      Stupid). A simple payload format makes it easy to review for
      correctness, implement, and have low complexity. Unfortunately
      contradicting requirements sometime makes it hard to do things simple.
      Complexity issues and problems that occur for RTP payload formats
      are:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Too many configurations:</dt>
<dd>Contradicting requirements
          results in that one configuration for each conceivable case is
          created. Such contradicting requirements are often between
          functionality and bandwidth. This has two big negatives. First all
          configurations needs to be implemented. Secondly the using
          application must select the most suitable configuration. Selecting
          the best configuration can be very difficult and in negotiating
          applications, this can create interoperability problems. The
          recommendation is to try to select a very limited (preferable one)
          configuration that preforms the most common case well and is capable
          of handling the other cases, but maybe less well.
</dd>
<dt>Hard to implement:</dt>
<dd>Certain payload formats may become
          difficult to implement both correctly and efficient. This needs to
          be considered in the design.
</dd>
<dt>Interaction with general mechanisms:</dt>
<dd>Special solutions
          may create issues with deployed tools for RTP, like tools for
          robuster transport of RTP. For example the requirement of non broken
          sequence space creates issues with using both payload type switching
          and interleaving any mechanism for media independent resilience
          within the stream.

Features of RTP payload formats</h3>

<p>There are number of common features in RTP payload formats. There
        are no general requirement to support these features, instead their
        applicability must be considered for each payload format. It might in
        fact be that certain features are not even applicable.

<a name="rfc.section.5.1.1"></a><h3>5.1.1.&nbsp;
Aggregation</h3>

<p>Aggregation allows for the inclusion of multiple ADUs within the
          same RTP payload. This is commonly supported for codec that produce
          ADUs of sizes smaller than the IP MTU. Do remember that the MTU may
          be significantly larger than 1500 bytes, 9000 bytes is available
          today and a MTU of 64k may be available in the future. Many speech
          codecs have the property of ADUs of a few fixed sizes. Video
          encoders generally may produce ADUs of quite flexible size. Thus the
          need for aggregation may be less. However in certain use cases the
          possibility to aggregate multiple ADUs especially for different
          playback times are useful.
</p>
<p>The main disadvantage of aggregation is the extra delay
          introduced, due to buffering until sufficient amount of ADUs have
          been collected and reduced robustness against packet loss. It also
          introduces buffering requirements on the receiver.

Fragmentation</h3>

<p>If the real-time media format has the property that it may
          produce ADUs that are larger than common MTUs sizes then
          fragmentation support should be considered. An RTP Payload format
          may always fall back on IP fragmentation, however as discussed in
          RFC 2736 this have some drawbacks. The usage of RTP payload format
          level fragmentation, does primarily allow for more efficient usage
          of RTP packet loss recovery mechanisms. However it may in some cases
          also allow usage of the partial ADU by doing media specific
          fragmentation at media specific boundaries.

<a name="rfc.section.5.1.3"></a><h3>5.1.3.&nbsp;
Interleaving and Transmission Re-Scheduling</h3>

<p>Interleaving has been implemented in a number of payload formats
          to allow for less quality reduction when packet loss occurs. When
          losses are bursty and several consecutive packets are lost, the
          impact on quality can be quite severe. Interleaving is used to
          convert that burst loss to several spread out individual losses. It
          can also be used when several ADUs are aggregated in the same
          packets. A loss of an RTP packet with several ADUs in the payload
          has the same affect as a burst loss if the ADUs would have been
          transmitted in individual packets. To reduce the burstiness of the
          loss, the data present in an aggregated payload may be interleaved,
          thus spread the loss over a longer time period.
</p>
<p>A requirement for doing interleaving within an RTP payload format
          is the aggregation of multiple ADUs. For formats that don't use
          aggregation there is still the possibility to implement an
          transmission order re-scheduling mechanism. That have the effect
          that packets transmitted next to each other originates from
          different points in the media stream. This can be used to mitigate
          burst losses, which may be useful if one transmit packets with small
          intervals. However it may also be used to transmit more significant
          data earlier in combination with RTP retransmission to allow for
          more graceful degradation and increased possibilities to receive the
          most important data, e.g. Intra frames of video.
</p>
<p>The drawbacks of interleaving is the significantly increased
          transmission buffering delay, making it mostly useless for low delay
          applications. It also creates significant buffering requirements on
          the receiver. That buffering also is problematic as it is usually
          difficult to indicate when a receiver may start consume data and
          still avoid buffer underrun caused by the interleaving mechanism
          itself. The transmission re-scheduling is only useful in a few
          specific cases, like in streaming with retransmissions. This must be
          weighted against the complexity of these schemes.

Media Back Channels</h3>

          The CMR field is used in gateway operations to circuit switched
          voice to allow an IP terminal to react to the CS networks need for a
          specific encoder mode. A common property for the media back channels
          is the need to have this signalling in direct relation to the media
          or the media path.
</p>
<p>If back channels are considered for an RTP payload format they

Scalability</h3>

<p>There exist some codecs that supports some type of scalability,
          i.e. where additional data can be used to improve media stream
          properties, but the additional data isn't required for decoding.
          This quality improvements has been so far been in a number of
          different types:
</p>

<blockquote class="text"><dl>

High Packet Rates</h3>

<p>Some media codecs requires high packet rates, and in these cases
          the RTP sequence number wraps to quickly. As rule of thumb, the
          sequence number space must not be possible to wrap in less than 2
          minutes (TCP maximum segment lifetime). If that may occur then the
          payload format should specify a extended sequence number field to
          allow the receiver to determine where a specific payload belongs in
          the sequence also in the face of extensive reordering. The RTP

        similar. They are all for frame based audio codecs and use a table of
        content structure. Each frame has a table of contents entry that
        indicate the type of the frame and if additional frames are present.
        This is quite flexible but produces unnecessary overhead if the ADU is
        fixed size and when aggregating multiple ones they are commonly of the
        same type. In that case a solution like that in <a class='info' href='#RFC4352'>AMR-WB+<span> (</span><span class='info'>Sjoberg, J., Westerlund, M., Lakaniemi, A., and S.

</p>
<p>AMR-WB+ does contain one less good feature which is depending on
        the media codec itself. The media codec produces a large range of
        different frame lengths in time perspective. The RTP timestamp rate is
        selected to the very unusual value of 72 kHz despite that output
        normally is at sample rate 48kHz. This timestamp rate is the smallest
        found value that would make all of the frames the codec could produce
        results in integer frame length in RTP timestamp ticks. That way a
        receiver can always correctly place the frames in relation to any
        other frame, also at frame length changes. The down side is that the
        decoder output for certain frame lengths are in fact partial samples.
        Resulting in that the output in samples from the codec will vary from
        frame to frame, potentially making implementation more difficult.

        contains some interesting features. MIDI is an audio format sensitive
        to packet losses, as the loss of a note off command will result in
        that a note will be stuck in an on state. To counter this a recovery
        journal is defined that provides a summarized state that allows the
        receiver to recover from packet losses quickly. It also uses RTCP and
        the reported highest sequence number to be able to prune the state the
        recovery journal needs to contain. These features appears limited in
        applicability for media formats that are highly stateful and primarily

<p>The definition of RTP payload formats for video has seen an

</p>
<p>The H.264 RTP payload format <a class='info' href='#RFC3984'>[RFC3984]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Wenger, S., Hannuksela, M., Stockhammer, T., Westerlund, M., and D. Singer, &ldquo;RTP Payload Format for H.264 Video,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> can be
        seen as a smorgasbord of functionality, some pretty advanced as the
        interleaving. The reason for this was to ensure that the majority of
        applications considered by the ITU-T and MPEG that can be supported by
        RTP was supported. This has created a payload format that rarely is
        implemented in its completeness. Despite that no major issues with
        interoperability has been reported. However, there are common
        complaints about its complexity.
</p>
<p>The RTP payload format for uncompressed video <a class='info' href='#RFC4175'>[RFC4175]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Gharai, L. and C. Perkins, &ldquo;RTP Payload Format for Uncompressed Video,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> is basically required to be mentioned in this
        context as it contains a special feature not commonly seen in RTP
        payload formats. Due to the high bit-rate and thus packet rate of
        uncompressed video (gigabits rather than megabits) the payload format
        include a field to extend the RTP sequence number as the normal 16-bit
        one can wrap in below a second. It also specifies a registry of
        different color sub-sampling that can be re-used in other video RTP
        payload formats.

Text</h3>

<p>There would be overstating that there exist a trend in text payload
        formats as only a single format actually carrying a text format has
        been standardized in IETF, namely T.140 <a class='info' href='#RFC4103'>[RFC4103]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hellstrom, G. and P.

Matsui, &ldquo;RTP Payload Format for 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Timed Text,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> could be considered to be text, despite it in
        the end was registered as a video format. This is decorated text,
        usable for subtitles and other embellishments of video which is why it
        ended up being registered as video format. However, it has many of the
        properties that text formats in generally have.
</p>
<p>The RTP payload format for T.140 was designed with high reliability
        in mind as real-time text commonly are a extremely low-bit rate
        application. Thus, it recommends the use of RFC 2190 with many
        redundancy generations. However, the format failed to provide a text
        block specific sequence number and relies instead of the RTP one to
        detection loss. This makes detection of missing text blocks
        unnecessarily difficult and hinders the deployment with other
        robustness mechanisms that would switch the payload type as that may
        result in erroneous error marking in the T.140 text stream.

<a name="rfc.section.7.1"></a><h3>7.1.&nbsp;
Security Consideration</h3>

<p>All Internet drafts requires a Security Consideration section. The
        security consideration section in an RTP payload format needs to
        concentrate on the security properties this particular format has.
        Some payload format has very little specific issues or properties and
        can fully fall back on the general RTP and used profile's security
        considerations. Due to that these are always applicable a reference to
        these are normally placed first in the security consideration
        section.
</p>
<p>The security issues of confidentiality, integrity protection and
        source authentication are common issues for all payload formats. These
        should be solved by payload external mechanism and does not need any
        special consideration in the payload format except for an reminder on
        these issues. A suitable stock text to inform people about this is
        included in the template.
</p>
<p>Potential security issues with an RTP payload format and the media
        encoding that needs to be considered are:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>That the decoding of the payload format or its media shows
            substantial non-uniformity, either in output or in complexity to
            perform the decoding operation. For example a generic
            non-destructive compression algorithm may provide an output of
            almost infinite size for a very limited input. Thus consuming
            memory or storage space out of proportion with what the receiving
            application expected causing some sort of disruption, i.e. a
            denial of service attack on the receiver by preventing that host
            to produce any good put. Certain decoding operations may also have
            variable consumption of amount of processing needed to perform
            such operations dependent on the input. This may also be a
            security risk if that processing load is possible to raise
            significantly from nominal simply by designing a malicious input
            sequence. If such potential exist this must be expressed in the
            security consideration section to make implementers aware of the
            need to take precautions against such behavior.
</li>
<li>The inclusion of active content in the media format or its
            transport. With active content means scripts etc that allows an
            attacker to perform potentially arbitrary operations on the
            receiver. Most active content have limited possibility to access
            the system or perform operations outside a protected sandbox. RFC
            4855 <a class='info' href='#RFC4855'>[RFC4855]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Casner, S., &ldquo;Media Type Registration of RTP Payload Formats,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> has a requirement that this is
            noted in the media types registration if the payload format
            contains active content or not. If the payload format has active
            content it is strongly recommend that references to any security
            model applicable for such content is referenced. A boiler plate
            text for no is included in the template which must be changed if
            the format actual carries active content.
</li>
<li>Some media formats allows for the carrying of "user data", or
            types of data which is not known at the time of the specification
            of the payload format. Such data may be a security risk and should
            be mentioned.
</li>
</ol><p>Suitable stock text for the security consideration is
        provided in the template. However the authors do need to actively
        consider any security issues from the start. Failure to address these
        issues is blocking approval and publication.

<a name="rfc.section.7.2"></a><h3>7.2.&nbsp;
Congestion Control</h3>

<p>RTP and its profiles do discuss congestion control. Congestion
        control is an important issue in any usage in non-dedicated networks.
        For that reason all RTP payload formats are recommended to discuss the
        possibilities that exist to regulate the bit-rate of the transmissions
        using the described RTP payload format. Some formats may have limited
        or step wise regulation of bit-rate. Such limiting factor should be
        discussed.

<a name="rfc.section.7.3"></a><h3>7.3.&nbsp;
IANA Consideration</h3>

<p>Due to that all RTP Payload format contains a Media Type
        specification they also need an IANA consideration section. The media
        type name must be registered and this is done by requesting that IANA
        register that media name. When that registration request is written it
        shall also be requested that the media type is included under the "RTP
        Payload Format MIME types" list part of the RTP registry.
</p>
<p>In addition to the above request for media type registration some
        payload formats may have parameters where in the future new parameter
        values needs to be added. In these cases a registry for that parameter
        must be created. This is done by defining the registry in the IANA
        consideration section. <a class='info' href='#RFC5226'>BCP 26 (RFC 5226)<span> (</span><span class='info'>Narten, T. and H. Alvestrand, &ldquo;Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC5226]
        provides guidelines to writing such registries. Care should be taken
        when defining the policy for new registrations.
</p>
<p>Before writing a new registry it is worth checking the existing
        ones in the IANA "MIME Media Type Sub-Parameter Registries". For
        example video formats needing a media parameter expressing color
        sub-sampling may be able to reuse those defined for <a class='info' href='#RFC4175'>video/raw<span> (</span><span class='info'>Gharai, L. and C. Perkins, &ldquo;RTP Payload Format for Uncompressed Video,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4175].

Authoring Tools</h3>

<p>This section informs and recommends some tools that may be used.

Editing Tools</h3>

<p>There is many choices when it comes to tools to choose for
        authoring Internet drafts. However in the end they needs to be able to
        produce a draft that conforms to the Internet drafts requirements. If
        you don't have any previous experience with authoring Internet drafts
        XML2RFC do have some advantages. It helps creating a lot of the
        necessary boiler plate in accordance with the latest rules. Thus
        reducing the effort. It also speeds up the publication after approval
        as the RFC-editor can use the source XML document to quicker produce
        the RFC.
</p>
<p>Another common choice is to use Microsoft Word and a suitable
        template, see <a class='info' href='#RFC3285'>[RFC3285]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Gahrns, M. and T. Hain, &ldquo;Using Microsoft Word to create Internet Drafts and RFCs,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> to produce the draft and
        print that using the generic text printer. It has some advantage when
        it comes to spell checking and change bars. However Word may also
        produce some problems, like changing formating, inconsistent result
        between what one sees in the editor and in the generated text
        document, at least according to the authors personal experience.

Verification Tools</h3>

<p>There are few tools that are very good to know about when writing
        an draft. These help check and verify parts of ones work. These tools
        can be found at http://tools.ietf.org.
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>ID Nits checker. It checks that the boiler plate and some other
            things that are easily verifiable by machine is okay in your
            draft. Always use it before submitting a draft to avoid direct
            refusal in the submission step.
</li>
<li>ABNF Parser and verification. Used to check that your ABNF
            parses correctly and warns about loose ends, like undefined
            symbols. However the actual content can only be verified by humans
            knowing what it intends to describe.
</li>
<li>RFC diff. A diff tool that is optimized for drafts and RFC. For
            example it doesn't point out that the foot and header has moved in
            relation to the text on every page.

<p>[The below text is for media types that is only defined for RTP
          payload formats. There exist certain media types that are defined
          both as RTP payload formats and file transfer. The rules for such
          types are documented in <a class='info' href='#RFC4855'>RFC 4855<span> (</span><span class='info'>Casner, S., &ldquo;Media Type Registration of RTP Payload Formats,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4855].]
</p>
<p>This media type depends on RTP framing, and hence is only defined
          for transfer via RTP [RFC3550]. Transport within other framing
          protocols is not defined at this time.

Securtiy Considerations</h3>

<p>[See Section <a class='info' href='#sec-consideration'>Section&nbsp;7.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Security Consideration</span><span>)</span></a>]
</p>
<p>RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
        are subject to the security considerations discussed in the <a class='info' href='#RFC3550'>RTP specification<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., Casner, S., Frederick, R., and V. Jacobson, &ldquo;RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3550] , and in any applicable RTP
        profile. The main security considerations for the RTP packet carrying
        the RTP payload format defined within this memo are confidentiality,
        integrity and source authenticity. Confidentiality is achieved by
        encryption of the RTP payload. Integrity of the RTP packets through
        suitable cryptographic integrity protection mechanism. Cryptographic
        system may also allow the authentication of the source of the payload.
        A suitable security mechanism for this RTP payload format should
        provide confidentiality, integrity protection and at least source
        authentication capable of determining if an RTP packet is from a
        member of the RTP session or not.
</p>
<p>Note that the appropriate mechanism to provide security to RTP and
        payloads following this memo may vary. It is dependent on the
        application, the transport, and the signalling protocol employed.
        Therefore a single mechanism is not sufficient, although if suitable
        the usage of <a class='info' href='#RFC3711'>SRTP<span> (</span><span class='info'>Baugher, M., McGrew, D., Naslund, M., Carrara, E., and K. Norrman, &ldquo;The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3711] is recommended. Other
        mechanism that may be used are <a class='info' href='#RFC4301'>IPsec<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kent, S. and K. Seo, &ldquo;Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4301] and
        <a class='info' href='#RFC5246'>TLS<span> (</span><span class='info'>Dierks, T. and E. Rescorla, &ldquo;The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC5246] (RTP over TCP), but also other
        alternatives may exist.
</p>
<p>This RTP payload format and its media decoder do not exhibit any
        significant non-uniformity in the receiver-side computational
        complexity for packet processing, and thus are unlikely to pose a
        denial-of-service threat due to the receipt of pathological data. Nor
        does the RTP payload format contain any active content.

        either of the statements. Fill in here any further potential security
        threats]
