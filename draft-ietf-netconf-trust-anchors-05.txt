                   A YANG Data Model for a Truststore
                  draft-ietf-netconf-trust-anchors-05

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG 1.1 data model for configuring global
   sets of X.509 certificates and SSH host-keys that can be referenced
   by other data models for trust.  While the SSH host-keys are uniquely
   for the SSH protocol, the X.509 certificates may have multiple uses,
   including authenticating protocol peers and verifying signatures.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG 1.1 [RFC7950] data model for configuring
   global sets of X.509 certificates and SSH host-keys that can be
   referenced by other data models for trust.  While the SSH host-keys
   are uniquely for the SSH protocol, the X.509 certificates may be used
   for multiple uses, including authenticating protocol peers and
   verifying signatures.

   This document in compliant with Network Management Datastore
   Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].  For instance, to support trust
   anchors installed during manufacturing, it is expected that such data
   may appear only in <operational>.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Tree Diagram Notation

   Tree diagrams used in this document follow the notation defined in
   [RFC8340].

2.  The Trust Anchors Model

2.1.  Tree Diagram

   The following tree diagram provides an overview of the "ietf-
   truststore" module.

2.2.  Example Usage

   The following example illustrates trust anchors in <operational> as
   described by Section 5.3 in [RFC8342].  This datastore view
   illustrates data set by the manufacturing process alongside
   conventional configuration.  This trust anchors instance has six sets
   of pinned certificates and one set of pinned host keys.

3.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this document is designed to be accessed
   via YANG based management protocols, such as NETCONF [RFC6241] and
   RESTCONF [RFC8040].  Both of these protocols have mandatory-to-
   implement secure transport layers (e.g., SSH, TLS) with mutual
   authentication.

   The NETCONF access control model (NACM) [RFC8341] provides the means
   to restrict access for particular users to a pre-configured subset of
   all available protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      /: The entire data tree defined by this module is sensitive to
         write operations.  For instance, the addition or removal of any
         trust anchor may dramatically alter the implemented security
         policy.  For this reason, the NACM extension "default-deny-
         write" has been set for the entire data tree.

   None of the readable data nodes in this YANG module are considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in network environments.

   This module does not define any RPCs, actions, or notifications, and
   thus the security consideration for such is not provided here.

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  The IETF XML Registry

   This document registers one URI in the "ns" subregistry of the IETF
   XML Registry [RFC3688].  Following the format in [RFC3688], the
   following registration is requested:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-truststore
      Registrant Contact: The NETCONF WG of the IETF.
      XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

Internet-Draft     A YANG Data Model for a Truststore          June 2019


Appendix A.  Change Log

A.1.  00 to 01

   o  Added features "x509-certificates" and "ssh-host-keys".

   o  Added nacm:default-deny-write to "trust-anchors" container.

A.2.  01 to 02

   o  Switched "list pinned-certificate" to use the "trust-anchor-cert-
      grouping" from crypto-types.  Effectively the same definition as
      before.

A.3.  02 to 03

   o  Updated copyright date, boilerplate template, affiliation, folding
      algorithm, and reformatted the YANG module.

A.4.  03 to 04

   o  Added groupings 'local-or-truststore-certs-grouping' and 'local-
      or-truststore-host-keys-grouping', matching similar definitions in
      the keystore draft.  Note new (and incomplete) "truststore" usage!

   o  Related to above, also added features 'truststore-supported' and
      'local-trust-anchors-supported'.

A.5.  04 to 05

   o  Renamed "trust-anchors" to "truststore"

   o  Removed "pinned." prefix everywhere, to match truststore rename

   o  Moved everything under a top-level 'grouping' to enable use in
      other contexts.

   o  Renamed feature from 'local-trust-anchors-supported' to 'local-
      definitions-supported' (same name used in keystore)

   o  Removed the "require-instance false" statement from the "*-ref"
      typedefs.

   o  Added missing "ssh-host-keys" and "x509-certificates" if-feature
      statements
