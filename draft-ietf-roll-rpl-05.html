<h1><br />RPL: IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low
    power and Lossy Networks<br />draft-ietf-roll-rpl-05</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are a class of network in which
      both the routers and their interconnect are constrained: LLN routers
      typically operate with constraints on (any subset of) processing power,
      memory and energy (battery), and their interconnects are characterized
      by (any subset of) high loss rates, low data rates and instability. LLNs
      are comprised of anything from a few dozen and up to thousands of LLN
      routers, and support point-to-point traffic (between devices inside the
      LLN), point-to-multipoint traffic (from a central control point to a
      subset of devices inside the LLN) and multipoint-to-point traffic (from
      devices inside the LLN towards a central control point). This document
      specifies the IPv6 Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL), which provides a
      mechanism whereby multipoint-to-point traffic from devices inside the
      LLN towards a central control point, as well as point-to-multipoint
      traffic from the central control point to the devices inside the LLN, is
      supported. Support for point-to-point traffic is also available.

Introduction</h3>

<p>Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are made largely of constrained
      nodes (with limited processing power, memory, and sometimes energy when
      they are battery operated). These routers are interconnected by lossy
      links, typically supporting only low data rates, that are usually
      unstable with relatively low packet delivery rates. Another
      characteristic of such networks is that the traffic patterns are not
      simply unicast, but in many cases point-to-multipoint or
      multipoint-to-point. Furthermore such networks may potentially comprise
      up to thousands of nodes. These characteristics offer unique challenges
      to a routing solution: the IETF ROLL Working Group has defined
      application-specific routing requirements for a Low power and Lossy
      Network (LLN) routing protocol, specified in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-building-routing-reqs'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;building&#8209;routing&#8209;reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Martocci, J., Riou, N., Mil, P., and W.

<a name="rfc.section.1.1"></a><h3>1.1.&nbsp;
Design Principles</h3>

<p>RPL was designed with the objective to meet the requirements
        spelled out in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-building-routing-reqs'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;building&#8209;routing&#8209;reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Martocci, J., Riou, N., Mil, P., and W. Vermeylen, &ldquo;Building Automation Routing Requirements in Low Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-home-routing-reqs'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;home&#8209;routing&#8209;reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Brandt, A. and J. Buron, &ldquo;Home Automation Routing Requirements in Low Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#RFC5673'>[RFC5673]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Pister, K., Thubert, P., Dwars, S., and T. Phinney, &ldquo;Industrial Routing Requirements in Low-Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>, and <a class='info' href='#RFC5548'>[RFC5548]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Dohler, M., Watteyne, T., Winter, T., and D. Barthel, &ldquo;Routing Requirements for Urban Low-Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>. Because
        those requirements are heterogeneous and sometimes incompatible in
        nature, the approach is first taken to design a protocol capable of
        supporting a core set of functionalities corresponding to the
        intersection of the requirements. As the RPL design evolves optional
        features may be added to address some application specific
        requirements. This is a key protocol design decision providing a
        granular approach in order to restrict the core of the protocol to a
        minimal set of functionalities, and to allow each implementation of
        the protocol to be optimized differently. All "MUST" application
        requirements that cannot be satisfied by RPL will be specifically
        listed in the Appendix A, accompanied by a justification.
</p>
<p>A network may run multiple instances of RPL concurrently. Each such
        instance may serve different and potentially antagonistic constraints
        or performance criteria. This document defines how a single instance
        operates.
</p>
<p>RPL is a generic protocol that is to be deployed by instantiating
        the generic operation described in this document with a specific
        objective function (OF) (which ties together metrics, constraints, and
        an optimization objective) to realize a desired objective in a given
        environment.
</p>
<p>A set of companion documents to this specification will provide
        further guidance in the form of applicability statements specifying a
        set of operating points appropriate to the Building Automation, Home
        Automation, Industrial, and Urban application scenarios.

Expectations of Link Layer Type</h3>

<p>As RPL is a routing protocol, it of course does not rely on any
        particular features of a specific link layer technology. RPL should be
        able to operate over a variety of different link layers, including but
        not limited to low power wireless or PLC (Power Line Communication)
        technologies.

<dt>DAG Instance:</dt>
<dd>A DAG Instance is a set of possibly
          multiple Destination Oriented DAGs. A network may have more than one
          DAG Instance, and a RPL router can participate to multiple DAG

          this manner do not necessarily share a common parent.
</dd>
<dt>DAG root:</dt>
<dd>A DAG root is a node within the DAG that has
          no outgoing edges. Because the graph is acyclic, by definition all

<dt>Sub-DAG</dt>
<dd>The sub-DAG of a node is the set of other
          nodes in the DAG that might use a path towards the DAG root that
          contains the node. Nodes in the sub-DAG of a node have a greater

</dd>
<dt>OF:</dt>
<dd>Objective Function. The Objective Function (OF)
          defines which routing metrics, optimization objectives, and related
          functions are in use in a DODAG. The Objective Function is further
          described in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;routing&#8209;metrics]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vasseur, J., Kim, M., Networks, D., and H.

<dt>Goal:</dt>
<dd>The Goal is a host or set of hosts that satisfy
          a particular application objective / OF. Whether or not a DODAG can
          provide connectivity to a goal is a property of the DODAG. For
          example, a goal might be a host serving as a data collection point,
          or a gateway providing connectivity to an external
          infrastructure.

<p>As they form networks, LLN devices often mix the roles of `host' and
      `router' when compared to traditional IP networks. In this document,
      `host' refers to an LLN device that can generate but does not forward
      RPL traffic, `router' refers to an LLN device that can forward as well
      as generate RPL traffic, and `node' refers to any RPL device, either a
      host or a router.

Instances, DODAGs, and DODAG Iterations</h3>

<p>Each DAG instance constructs a routing topology optimized for a
        certain Objective Function (OF). A DAG instance may provide routes to
        certain destination prefixes. A single DAG instance contains one or
        more Destination Oriented DAG (DODAG) roots. These roots may operate
        independently, or may coordinate over a non-LLN backchannel.
</p>
<p>Each root has a unique identifier, the DAGID, such that nodes can
        identify the DODAG root.
</p>
<p>A DAG instance may comprise:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>a single DODAG with a single root 
<ul class="text">
<li>For example, a DODAG optimized to minimize latency rooted
                at a single centralized lighting controller in a home
                automation application.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>multiple uncoordinated DODAGs with independent roots (differing
            DAGIDs) 
<ul class="text">
<li>For example, multiple data collection points in an urban
                data collection application that do not have an always-on
                backbone suitable to coordinate to form a single DODAG, and
                further use the formation of multiple DODAGs as a means to
                dynamically and autonomously partition the network.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a single DODAG with a single virtual root coordinating LLN
            sinks (with the same DAGID) over some non-LLN backbone
<ul class="text">
<li>For example, multiple border routers operating with a
                reliable backbone, e.g. in support of a 6LowPAN application,
                that are capable to act as logically equivalent sinks to the
                same DODAG.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a combination of one of the above as suited to some application
            scenario.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Traffic is bound to a specific DODAG Instance by a marking in the
        flow label of the IPv6 header. Traffic originating in support of a
        particular application may be tagged to follow an appropriate DAG
        instance, for example to follow paths optimized for low latency or low
        energy. The provisioning or automated discovery of a mapping between
        an InstanceID and a type or service of application traffic is beyond
        the scope of this specification.

<p>A Destination Advertisement Object (DAO) conveys destination

Routing Metrics and Constraints Used By RPL</h3>

<p>Routing metrics are used by routing protocols to compute the shortest
      paths. Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) such as IS-IS (<a class='info' href='#RFC5120'>[RFC5120]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Przygienda, T., Shen, N., and N. Sheth, &ldquo;M-ISIS: Multi Topology (MT) Routing in Intermediate System to Intermediate Systems (IS-ISs),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>) and OSPF (<a class='info' href='#RFC4915'>[RFC4915]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Psenak, P., Mirtorabi, S., Roy, A., Nguyen, L., and P. Pillay-Esnault, &ldquo;Multi-Topology (MT) Routing in OSPF,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>) use
      static link metrics. Such link metrics can simply reflect the bandwidth
      or can also be computed according to a polynomial function of several
      metrics defining different link characteristics; in all cases they are
      static metrics. Some routing protocols support more than one metric: in
      the vast majority of the cases, one metric is used per (sub)topology.
      Less often, a second metric may be used as a tie-breaker in the presence
      of Equal Cost Multiple Paths (ECMP). The optimization of multiple
      metrics is known as an NP complete problem and is sometimes supported by
      some centralized path computation engine.
</p>
<p>In contrast, LLNs do require the support of both static and dynamic
      metrics. Furthermore, both link and node metrics are required. In the
      case of RPL, it is virtually impossible to define one metric, or even a
      composite, that will satisfy all use cases.
</p>
<p>In addition, RPL supports constrained-based routing where constraints
      may be applied to link and nodes. If a link or a node does not satisfy a
      required constraint, it is `pruned' from the candidate list thus leading
      to a constrained shortest path.
</p>
<p>The set of supported link/node constraints and metrics is specified

Greediness and Rank-based Instabilities</h3>

<p>Once a node has joined a DODAG, RPL disallows certain behaviors,
          including greediness, in order to prevent resulting instabilities in
          the DODAG.
</p>
<p>If a node is allowed to be greedy and attempts to move deeper in
          the DODAG, beyond its most preferred parent, in order to increase
          the size of the parent set, then an instability can result. This is
          illustrated in <a class='info' href='#Greedy'>Figure&nbsp;16<span> (</span><span class='info'>Greedy DAG Parent Selection</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Suppose a node is willing to receive and process a DIO messages
          from a node in its own sub-DAG, and in general a node deeper than
          it. In such cases a chance exists to create a feedback loop, wherein
          two or more nodes continue to try and move in the DODAG in order to
          optimize against each other. In some cases this will result in an
          instability. It is for this reason that RPL limits the cases where a
          node may process DIO messages from deeper nodes to some forms of
          local repair. This approach creates an `event horizon', whereby a
          node cannot be influenced beyond some limit into an instability by
          the action of nodes that may be in its own sub-DAG.
</p>
<p>A further example of the consequences of greedy operation, and
          instability related to processing DIO messages from nodes of greater
          rank, may be found in <a class='info' href='#ExGreedyExample'>Appendix&nbsp;B.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Example: Greedy Parent Selection and Instability</span><span>)</span></a>

        detect loops, and as such must demonstrate certain properties. The
        exact calculation of the rank is left to the Objective Function, and
        may depend on parents, link metrics, and the node configuration and
        policies.
</p>
<p>The rank is not a cost metric, although its value can be derived
        from and influenced by metrics. The rank has properties of its own
        that are not necessarily that of all metrics: </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Type:</dt>
<dd>Rank is an abstract scalar. Some metrics are
            boolean (e.g. grounded), others are statistical and better
            expressed as a tuple like an expected value and a variance. Some
            OCPs use not one but a set of metrics bound by a piece of
            logic.
</dd>
<dt>Function:</dt>
<dd>Rank is the expression of a relative
            position within a DODAG iteration with regard to neighbors and,
            not necessarily a good indication or a proper expression of a
            distance or a cost to the root.
</dd>
<dt>Stability:</dt>
<dd>The stability of the rank determines that
            of the routing topology. Some dampening or filtering might be
            applied to keep the topology stable and the rank does not
            necessarily change as fast as some physical metrics would. A new
            iteration is a good opportunity to reconcile the discrepancies
            that might form over time between the metrics and the ranks.
</dd>
<dt>Granularity:</dt>
<dd>Rank is coarse grained. A fine
            granularity would prevent the selection of siblings.
</dd>
<dt>Properties:</dt>
<dd>Rank is strictly monotonic and can be
            used to validate a progression from or towards the root. A metric
            like bandwidth or jitter does not necessarily exhibit such
            property.
</dd>
<dt>Abstract:</dt>
<dd>Rank does not have a physical unit, but
            rather a range of increment per hop that varies from 1 (best) to
            16 (worst), where the assignment of each value is to be determined
            by the implementation.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>The rank value feeds back into the DAG parent selection according
        to the RPL loop-avoidance strategy. Once a parent has been added, and
        a rank value for the node within the DODAG has been advertised, the
        nodes further options with regard to DAG parent selection and movement
        within the DODAG are restricted in favor of loop avoidance.
</p>
<p>The computation of the DAG rank MUST be done in such a way so as to
        maintain the following properties for any nodes M and N that are
        neighbors in the LLN:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>DAGRank(M) is less than DAGRank(N):</dt>
<dd>In this case, M
            is probably located in a more preferred position than N in the
            DODAG with respect to the metrics and optimizations defined by the
            objective code point. In any fashion, Node M may safely be a DAG
            parent for Node N without risk of creating a loop. Further, for a
            node N, all parents in the DAG parent set must be of rank less
            than self's DAGRank(N). In other words, the rank presented by a
            node N MUST be greater (deeper) than that presented by any of its
            parents.
</dd>
<dt>DAGRank(M) equals DAGRank(N):</dt>
<dd>In this case M and N
            are located positions of relatively the same optimality within the
            DODAG. In some cases, Node M may be used as a successor by Node N,
            but with related chance of creating a loop that must be detected
            and broken by some other means.
</dd>
<dt>DAGRank(M) is greater than DAGRank(N):</dt>
<dd>In this case,
            then node M is located in a less preferred position than N in the
            DODAG with respect to the metrics and optimizations defined by the
            objective code point. Further, Node (M) may in fact be in Node
            (N)'s sub-DAG. There is a higher risk to Node (N) selecting Node
            (M) as a DAG parent, as such a selection may create a loop.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>As an example, the DAG rank could be computed in such a way so as
        to closely track ETX when the objective function is to minimize ETX,
        or latency when the objective function is to minimize latency, or in a
        more complicated way as appropriate to the objective code point being
        used within the DODAG.

</p>
<p>The Destination Prefix suboption is used when the DODAG
                root, or another node located upwards along the DODAG on the
                path to the DODAG root, needs to indicate that it offers
                connectivity to destination prefixes other than the default.
                This may be useful in cases where more than one LBR is
                operating within the LLN and offering connectivity to
                different administrative domains, e.g. a home network and a
                utility network. In such cases, upon observing the Destination
                Prefixes offered by a particular DODAG, a node MAY decide to
                join multiple DODAGs in support of a particular
                application.
</p>
<p>The Length is coded as the length of the suboption in
                octets, excluding the Type and Length fields.
</p>
<p>Prf is the Route Preference as in <a class='info' href='#RFC4191'>[RFC4191]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Draves, R. and D. Thaler, &ldquo;Default Router Preferences and More-Specific Routes,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>. The reserved fields MUST be set to
                zero on transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.
</p>
<p>The Prefix Lifetime is a 32-bit unsigned integer
                representing the length of time in seconds (relative to the
                time the packet is sent) that the Destination Prefix is valid
                for route determination. The lifetime is initially set by the
                node that owns the prefix and denotes the valid lifetime for
                that prefix (similar to AdvValidLifetime <a class='info' href='#RFC4861'>[RFC4861]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Narten, T., Nordmark, E., Simpson, W., and H. Soliman, &ldquo;Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6),&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>). The value might be reduced by the
                originator and/or en-route nodes that will not provide
                connectivity for the whole valid lifetime. A value of all one
                bits (0xFFFFFFFF) represents infinity. A value of all zero
                bits (0x00000000) indicates a loss of reachability.
</p>
<p>The Prefix Length is an 8-bit unsigned integer that
                indicates the number of leading bits in the destination
                prefix.
</p>
<p>The Destination Prefix contains Prefix Length significant
                bits of the destination prefix. The remaining bits of the
                Destination Prefix, as required to complete the trailing
                octet, are set to 0.
</p>
<p>In the event that a DIO message may need to specify
                connectivity to more than one destination, the Destination
                Prefix suboption may be repeated.

<p>The DAG Configuration suboption is used to distribute
                configuration information for DAG Operation through the DODAG.
                The information communicated in this suboption is generally
                static and unchanging within the DODAG, therefore it is not
                necessary to include in every DIO. This suboption MAY be
                included occasionally by the DODAG Root, and MUST be included
                in response to a unicast request, e.g. a DAG Information
                Solicitation (DIS) message.
</p>
<p>The Length is coded as 5.
</p>
<p>DIOIntervalDoublings is an 8-bit unsigned integer,
                configured on the DODAG root and used to configure the trickle
                timer governing when DIO message should be sent within the
                DODAG. DIOIntervalDoublings is the number of times that the
                DIOIntervalMin is allowed to be doubled during the trickle
                timer operation.
</p>
<p>DIOIntervalMin is an 8-bit unsigned integer, configured on
                the DODAG root and used to configure the trickle timer
                governing when DIO message should be sent within the DODAG.
                The minimum configured interval for the DIO trickle timer in
                units of ms is 2^DIOIntervalMin. For example, a DIOIntervalMin
                value of 16ms is expressed as 4.
</p>
<p>DIORedundancyConstant is an 8-bit unsigned integer used to
                configure suppression of DIO transmissions.
                DIORedundancyConstant is the minimum number of relevant
                incoming DIOs required to suppress a DIO transmission. If the
                value is 0xFF then the suppression mechanism is disabled.
</p>
<p>MaxRankInc, 8-bit unsigned integer, is the
                DAGMaxRankIncrease. This is the allowable increase in rank in
                support of local repair. If DAGMaxRankIncrease is 0 then this
                mechanism is disabled.

</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The first is an InstanceID. An InstanceID defines what OF a
              DAG uses and may also indicate what destinations are offered. A
              network may have multiple InstanceIDs, each of which defines an
              independent DAG optimized for a different OF and/or application.
              The DAG defined by an InstanceID is called a DAG Instance.
</li>
<li>The second is a DAGID. The scope of a DAGID is a DAG
              Instance. A combination of InstanceID and DAGID defines a DODAG.
              A DAG Instance may have multiple DODAGs.
</li>
<li>The third value is a DAG Sequence Number. The scope of a DAG
              Sequence Number is a DODAG. A DODAG is sometimes reconstructed
              from the root, by incrementing the DAGSequenceNumber. A
              combination of InstanceID, DAGID, and DAG Sequence Number
              defines a DODAG Iteration.
</li>
<li>The fourth value is rank. The scope of rank is a DODAG
              Iteration. Rank establishes a partial order over a DODAG
              Iteration, defining individual node positions.

<p>For each DODAG that a node is, or may become, a member of, the

<p>For each node in a DAG parent/sibling set, the implementation

DAG Discovery and Maintenance</h3>

<p>DAG discovery allows a node to join a DODAG rooted at a DODAG root
        by discovering neighbors that are members of the DODAG, and
        identifying a set of parents. DAG discovery also identifies siblings,
        which may be used later to provide additional path diversity towards
        the DODAG root.
</p>
<p>DODAG discovery may avoid loops by constraining how and when nodes
        can increase their rank, and by statistically poisoning the nodes that
        present the highest risk.
</p>
<p>DAG discovery enables nodes to implement different policies for
        selecting their DAG parents in the DODAG by using implementation
        specific policy functions. DAG discovery specifies a set of rules to
        be followed by all implementations to enable interoperation.

DODAG Iteration</h3>

<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>An InstanceID SHOULD be administratively provisioned on a
                DODAG root that is significant RPL objective. The InstanceID
                MUST be unique to that purpose across the scope of the
                LLN.
</li>
<li>A DAGID MUST be unique within the scope of the InstanceID.
                It MAY be derived from the IPv6 address of the DODAG root.
</li>
<li>A node MAY belong to multiple DAG instances. The related
                details of operation are outside the scope of this
                specification.
</li>
<li>DODAG roots MAY increment the DAGSequenceNumber that they
                advertise.
</li>
<li>When a DODAG root increments its DAGSequenceNumber, it MUST
                follow the conventions of Serial Number Arithmetic as
                described in <a class='info' href='#RFC1982'>[RFC1982]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Elz, R. and R. Bush, &ldquo;Serial Number Arithmetic,&rdquo; August&nbsp;1996.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</li>
<li>The tuple (InstanceID, DAGID, DAGSequenceNumber) uniquely
                defines a DODAG Iteration. All of a node's parents within a
                DODAG MUST belong to the same DODAG iteration, as conveyed by
                the last heard DIO from each parent.
</li>
<li>A node MUST NOT propagate DIOs for a DODAG Iteration unless
                it is the DODAG root of the DODAG iteration or has selected
                DODAG parents in that DODAG iteration.
</li>
<li>A node acting as a leaf SHOULD NOT propagate DIOs for a
                DODAG Iteration.
</li>
<li>A node MUST belong at most to one DODAG Iteration per
                InstanceID.
</li>
<li>Within a given DODAG, a node that is a not a root MUST NOT
                advertise a DAGSequenceNumber higher than the highest
                DAGSequenceNumber it has heard.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Within a particular implementation, a DODAG root may increment
            the DAGSequenceNumber periodically, at a rate that depends on the
            deployment. In other implementations loop detection may be
            considered sufficient to solve the routing issues, and the DODAG
            root may increment the DAGSequenceNumber only upon administrative
            intervention. Another possibility is that nodes within the LLN
            have some means to signal the DODAG root in order to request an
            on-demand increment when routing issues are detected.
</p>
<p>As the DAGSequenceNumber is incremented, a new DODAG Iteration
            spreads outward from the DODAG root. Thus a parent that advertises
            the new DAGSequenceNumber can not possibly belong to the sub-DAG
            of a node that still advertises an older DAGSequenceNumber. A node
            may safely add such a parent, without risk of forming a loop,
            without regard to its relative rank in the prior DODAG Iteration.
            This is equivalent to jumping to a different DODAG.
</p>
<p>As a node transitions to new DODAG Iterations as a consequence
            of following these rules, the node will be unable to advertise the
            previous DODAG Iteration (prior DAGSequenceNumber) once it has
            committed to advertising the new DODAG Iteration.
</p>
<p>During a transition to a new DODAG Iteration, a node may decide
            to forward packets via 'future parents' that belong to the same
            DODAG (same InstanceID and DAGID), but are observed to advertise a
            more recent (incremented) DAGSequenceNumber.

            root, including the backbone root if it also serves as LLN root,

Rank and Movement within a DODAG Iteration</h3>

<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>A node MUST NOT advertise a rank less than or equal to any
                member of its parent set within the DODAG Iteration.
</li>
<li>A node MAY advertise a rank lower than its prior
                advertisement within the DODAG Iteration. (This corresponds to
                a node moving up within the DODAG Iteration).
</li>
<li>Let L be the lowest rank within a DODAG iteration that a
                given node has advertised. Within a DODAG Iteration, that node
                MUST NOT advertise an effective rank deeper than L +
                DAGMaxRankIncrease. INFINITE_RANK is an exception to this
                rule: a node MAY advertise an INFINITE_RANK at any time. (This
                corresponds to a limited rank increase for the purpose of
                local repair within the DODAG Iteration.)
</li>
<li>A node MAY, at any time, choose to join a different DODAG
                within a DAG Instance. Such a join has no rank restrictions,
                unless that different DODAG is a DODAG Iteration that the node
                has been a prior member of, in which case the rule of the
                previous bullet (3) must be observed. Until a node transmits a
                DIO indicating its new DODAG membership, it MUST forward
                packets along the previous DODAG.
</li>
<li>A node MAY, at any time after hearing the next
                DAGSequenceNumber Iteration advertised from suitable parents,
                choose to migrate up to the next DODAG Iteration within the
                DODAG.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Conceptually, an implementation is maintaining a parent set
            within the DODAG Iteration. Movement entails changes to the parent
            set. Moving up does not present the risk to create a loop but
            moving down might, so that operation is subject to additional
            constraints.
</p>
<p>When a node migrates into the next DODAG Iteration, the parent
            and sibling sets need to be rebuilt for the new iteration. An
            implementation could defer to migrate until for some reasonable
            time to see if some other neighbors with potentially better
            metrics but higher rank announce themselves. Similarly, when a
            node jumps into a new DODAG it needs to construct new
            parent/sibling sets for the new DODAG.
</p>
<p>When a node moves to improve its position, it must conceptually
            abandon all parents and siblings with a rank larger than itself.
            As a consequence of the movement it may also add new siblings.
            Such a movement may occur at any time to decrease the rank, as per
            the calculation indicated by the OF. Maintenance of the parent and
            sibling sets occurs as the rank of candidate neighbors is observed
            as reported in their DIOs.
</p>
<p>If a node needs to move down a DODAG that it is attached to,
            causing the DAG rank to increase, then it MAY poison its routes
            and delay before moving as described in <a class='info' href='#DAGDiscoveryRulesPoison'>Section&nbsp;6.3.1.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Poisoning a Broken Path</span><span>)</span></a>.

Poisoning a Broken Path</h3>

<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>A node MAY poison, in order to avoid being used as an
                ancestor by the nodes in its sub-DAG, by advertising an
                effective rank of INFINITE_RANK and resetting the associated
                DIO trickle timer to cause the INFINITE_RANK to be announced
                promptly.
</li>
<li>The node MAY advertise an effective rank of INFINITE_RANK
                for an arbitrary number of DIO timer events before announcing
                a new rank.
</li>
<li>As per <a class='info' href='#DAGDiscoveryRulesMove'>Section&nbsp;6.3.1.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rank and Movement within a DODAG Iteration</span><span>)</span></a>, the
                node MUST advertise INFINITE_RANK within the DODAG iteration
                if its revised rank would exceed the maximum DAG rank
                increase.
</li>
</ol>

<p>An implementation may choose to employ this poisoning mechanism
            when a node that loses all of its current parents, i.e. the set of
            DAG parents becomes depleted, and it can not jump onto an
            alternate DODAG An alternate mechanism is to form a floating
            DODAG.
</p>
<p>The motivation for delaying announcement of the revised route
            through multiple DIO events is to (i) increase tolerance to DIO
            loss, (ii) allow time for the poisoning action to propagate, and
            (iii) to develop an accurate assessment of its new rank. Such
            gains are obtained at the expense of potentially increasing the
            delay before lower portions of the network are able to
            re-establish up routes. Path redundancy in the DAG reduces the
            significance of either effect, since children with alternate
            parents should be able to utilize those alternates and retain rank
            while the detached parent re-establishes its rank.
</p>
<p>Although an implementation may advertise INFINITE_RANK for the
            purposes of poisoning, it is not expected to be equivalent to
            setting the rank to INFINITE_RANK, and an implementation would
            likely retain its rank value prior to the poisoning in some form,
            for purpose of maintaining its effective position within (L +
            DAGMaxRankIncrease).

Trickle Timer for DIO Transmission</h3>

<p>RPL treats the construction of a DODAG as a consistency problem,
          and uses a trickle timer <a class='info' href='#Levis08'>[Levis08]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Levis, P., Brewer, E., Culler, D., Gay, D., Madden, S., Patel, N., Polastre, J., Shenker, S., Szewczyk, R., and A.

<p>For each DODAG that a node is part of, the node must maintain a

<dd>The current length of the communication

Resetting the Trickle Timer</h3>

<p>The trickle timer for a DODAG is reset by:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Setting I_min and I_doublings to the values learned from
                the DIO message.
</li>
<li>Setting C to zero.
</li>
<li>Setting I to I_min.
</li>
<li>Setting T to a random value as described above.
</li>
<li>Restarting the trickle timer to expire after a duration
                T
</li>
</ol>

<p>When a node learns about a DODAG through a DIO message and
            makes the decision to join it, it initializes the state of the
            trickle timer by resetting the trickle timer and listening. Each
            time it hears a redundant DIO message for this DODAG, it MAY
            increment C. The exact determination of redundant is left to an
            implementation; it could include DIOs that advertise the same
            rank.
</p>
<p>When the timer fires at time T, the node compares C to the
            redundancy constant, DIORedundancyConstant. If C is less than that
            value, or if the DIORedundancyConstant value is 0xFF, the node
            generates a new DIO message and multicasts it. When the
            communication interval I expires, the node doubles the interval I
            so long as it has previously doubled it fewer than I_doubling
            times, resets C, and chooses a new T value.

<p>When connection to a fixed network is not possible or preferable

Collision</h3>

<p>A race condition occurs if 2 nodes send DIO messages at the same
        time and then attempt to join each other. This might happen, for
        example, between nodes which act as DAG root of their own DODAGs. In
        order to detect the situation, LLN Nodes time stamp the sending of DIO
        message. Any DIO message received within a short link-layer-dependent
        period introduces a risk. It left to the implementation to define the
        duration of the risk window.
</p>
<p>There is risk of a collision when a node receives and processes a
        DIO within the risk window. For example, it may occur that two nodes
        are associated with different DODAGs and near-simultaneously send DIO
        messages, which are received and processed by both, and possibly
        result in both nodes simultaneously deciding to attach to each other.
        As a remedy, in the face of a potential collision, as determined by
        receiving a DIO within the risk window, the DIO message is not
        processed. It is expected that subsequent DIOs would not cross.

Establishing Routing State Down the DODAG</h3>

<p>The destination advertisement mechanism supports the dissemination
        of routing state required to support traffic flows down along the
        DODAG, from the DODAG root toward nodes.
</p>
<p>As a result of destination advertisement operation:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Destination advertisement establishes down routes along the
            DODAG. Such paths consist of:
</li>
<ul class="text">
<li>Hop-By-Hop routing state within islands of `stateful'
              nodes.
</li>
<li>Source Routing `bridges' across nodes that do not retain
              state.
</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>Destinations disseminated with the destination advertisement
        mechanism may be prefixes, individual hosts, or multicast listeners.
        The mechanism supports nodes of varying capabilities as follows:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>When nodes are capable of storing routing state, they may
            inspect destination advertisements and learn hop-by-hop routing
            state toward destinations by populating their routing tables with
            the routes learned from nodes in their sub-DAG. In this process
            they may also learn necessary piecewise source routes to traverse
            regions of the LLN that do not maintain routing state. They may
            perform route aggregation on known destinations before emitting
            Destination Advertisements.
</li>
<li>When nodes are incapable of storing routing state, they may
            forward destination advertisements, recording the reverse route as
            the go in order to support the construction of piecewise source
            routes.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Nodes that are capable of storing routing state, and finally the
        DODAG roots, are able to learn which destinations are contained in the
        sub-DAG below the node, and via which next-hop neighbors. The
        dissemination and installation of this routing state into nodes allows
        for Hop-By-Hop routing from the DODAG root down the DODAG. The
        mechanism is further enhance by supporting the construction of source
        routes across stateless `gaps' in the DODAG, where nodes are incapable
        of storing additional routing state. An adaptation of this mechanism
        allows for the implementation of loose-source routing.
</p>
<p>A special case, the reception of a destination advertisement
        addressed to a link-local multicast address, allows for a node to
        learn destinations directly available from its one-hop neighbors.
</p>
<p>A design choice behind advertising routes via destination
        advertisements is not to synchronize the parent and children databases
        along the DODAG, but instead to update them regularly to recover from
        the loss of packets. The rationale for that choice is time variations
        in connectivity across unreliable links. If the topology can be
        expected to change frequently, synchronization might be an excessive
        goal in terms of exchanges and protocol complexity. The approach used
        here results in a simple protocol with no real peering. The
        destination advertisement mechanism hence provides for periodic
        updates of the routing state, similarly to other protocols such as RIP

Overview</h3>

<p>According to implementation specific policy, a subset or all of
            the feasible parents in the DODAG may be selected to receive
            prefix information from the destination advertisement mechanism.
            This subset of DAG parents shall be designated the set of DA
            parents.
</p>
<p>As DAO messages for particular destinations move up the DODAG,
            a sequence counter is used to guarantee their freshness. The
            sequence counter is incremented by the source of the DAO message
            (the node that owns the prefix, or learned the prefix via some
            other means), each time it issues a DAO message for its prefix.
            Nodes that receive the DAO message and, if scope allows, will be
            forwarding a DAO message for the unmodified destination up the
            DODAG, will leave the sequence number unchanged. Intermediate
            nodes will check the sequence counter before processing a DAO
            message, and if the DAO is unchanged (the sequence counter has not
            changed), then the DAO message will be discarded without
            additional processing. Further, if the DAO message appears to be
            out of synch (the sequence counter is 2 or more behind the present
            value) then the DAO state is considered to be stale and may be
            purged, and the DAO message is discarded. The rank is also added
            for tracking purposes; nodes that are storing routing state may
            use it to determine which possible next-hops for the destination
            are more optimal.
</p>
<p>If destination advertisements are activated in the DIO message
            as indicated by the `D' bit, the node sends unicast destination
            advertisements to one of its DA parents, that is selected as most
            favored for incoming down traffic. The node only accepts unicast
            destination advertisements from any nodes but those contained in
            the DA parent subset.
</p>
<p>Receiving a DIO message with the `D' destination advertisement
            bit set from a DAG parent stimulates the sending of a delayed
            destination advertisement back, with the collection of all known
            prefixes (that is the prefixes learned via destination
            advertisements for nodes lower in the DODAG, and any connected
            prefixes). If the Destination Advertisement Supported (A) bit is
            set in the DIO message for the DODAG, then a destination
            advertisement is also sent to a DAG parent once it has been added
            to the DA parent set after a movement, or when the list of
            advertised prefixes has changed.
</p>
<p>A node that modifies its DAG Parent set may set the `D' bit in
            subsequent DIO propagation in order to trigger destination
            advertisements to be updated to its DAG Parents and other
            ancestors on the DODAG. Additional recommendations and guidelines
            regarding the use of this mechanism are still under consideration
            and will be elaborated in a future revision of this
            specification.
</p>
<p>Destination advertisements may advertise positive (prefix is
            present) or negative (removed) DAO messages, termed as no-DAOs. A
            no-DAO is stimulated by the disappearance of a prefix below. This
            is discovered by timing out after a request (a DIO message) or by
            receiving a no-DAO. A no-DAO is a conveyed as a DAO message with a
            DAO Lifetime of ZERO_LIFETIME.
</p>
<p>A node that is capable of recording the state information
            conveyed in a unicast DAO message will do so upon receiving and
            processing the DAO message, thus provisioning routing state
            concerning destinations located downwards along the DODAG. If a
            node capable of recording state information receives a DAO message
            containing a Reverse Route Stack, then the node knows that the DAO
            message has traversed one or more nodes that did not retain any
            routing state as it traversed the path from the DAO source to the
            node. The node may then extract the Reverse Route Stack and retain
            the included state in order to specify Source Routing instructions
            along the return path towards the destination. The node MUST set
            the RRCount back to zero and clear the Reverse Route Stack prior
            to passing the DAO message information on.
</p>
<p>A node that is unable to record the state information conveyed
            in the DAO message will append the next-hop address to the Reverse
            Route Stack, increment the RRCount, and then pass the destination
            advertisement on without recording any additional state. In this
            way the Reverse Route Stack will contain a vector of next hops
            that must be traversed along the reverse path that the DAO message
            has traveled. The vector will be ordered such that the node
            closest to the destination will appear first in the list. In such
            cases, if it is useful to the implementation to try and provision
            redundant paths, the node may choose to convey the destination
            advertisement to one or more DAG parents in order of preference as
            guided by an implementation specific policy.
</p>
<p>In certain cases (called hybrid cases), some nodes along the
            path a destination advertisement follows up the DODAG may store
            state and some may not. The destination advertisement mechanism
            allows for the provisioning of routing state such that when a
            packet is traversing down the DODAG, some nodes may be able to
            directly forward to the next hop, and other nodes may be able to
            specify a piecewise source route in order to bridge spans of
            stateless nodes within the path on the way to the desired
            destination.
</p>
<p>In the case where no node is able to store any routing state as
            destination advertisements pass by, and the DAG root ends up with
            DAO messages that contain a completely specified route back to the
            originating node in the form of the inverted Reverse Route Stack.
            A DAG root should not request (Destination Advertisement Trigger)
            nor indicate support (Destination Advertisement Supported) for
            destination advertisements if it is not able to store the Reverse
            Route Stack information in this case.
</p>
<p>The destination advertisement mechanism requires stateful nodes
            to maintain lists of known prefixes. A prefix entry contains the
            following abstract information:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>A reference to the ND entry that was created for the
                advertising neighbor.
</li>
<li>The IPv6 address and interface for the advertising
                neighbor.
</li>
<li>The logical equivalent of the full destination
                advertisement information (including the prefixes, depth, and
                Reverse Route Stack, if any).
</li>
<li>A 'reported' Boolean to keep track whether this prefix was
                reported already, and to which of the DA parents.
</li>
<li>A counter of retries to count how many DIO messages were
                sent on the interface to the advertising neighbor without
                reachability confirmation for the prefix.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that nodes may receive multiple information from different
            neighbors for a specific destination, as different paths through
            the DODAG may be propagating information up the DODAG for the same
            destination. A node that is recording routing state will keep
            track of the information from each neighbor independently, and
            when it comes time to propagate the DAO message for a particular
            prefix to the DA parents, then the DAO information will be
            selected from among the advertising neighbors who offer the least
            depth to the destination.
</p>
<p>When a node loses connectivity to a child that is used as next
            hop for a route learned from a DAO, the node should cleanup all
            routes and DAO states that are related to that child. If the lost
            child was the only adjacency leading to the DAO prefix, the node
            should poison the route by sending no-DAOs to the parents to which
            it has advertised the DAO prefixes.
</p>
<p>The destination advertisement mechanism stores the prefix
            entries in one of 3 abstract lists; the Connected, the Reachable
            and the Unreachable lists.
</p>
<p>The Connected list corresponds to the prefixes owned and
            managed by the local node.

Destination Advertisement Timers</h3>

<p>The destination advertisement mechanism requires 2 timers;
              the DelayDAO timer and the RemoveTimer.
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The DelayDAO timer is armed upon a stimulation to send a
                  destination advertisement (such as a DIO message from a DA
                  parent). When the timer is armed, all entries in the
                  Reachable list as well as all entries for Connected list are
                  set to not be reported yet for that particular DA
                  parent.
</li>
<li>For a root, the DIO timer has a duration of
                  DEF_DAO_LATENCY. For a node in a DODAG iteration, the
                  DelayDAO timer has a duration that is randomized between
                  (DEF_DAO_LATENCY divided by the Rank of the node) and
                  (DEF_DAO_LATENCY divided by the Rank of the parent). The
                  intention is that nodes located deeper in the DODAG
                  iteration should have a shorter DelayDAO timer, allowing DAO
                  messages a chance to be reported from deeper in the DODAG
                  and potentially aggregated along sub-DAGs before propagating
                  further up.
</li>
<li>The RemoveTimer is used to clean up entries for which DAO
                  messages are no longer being received from the sub-DAG.
</li>
<ul class="text">
<li>When a DIO message is sent that is requesting
                    destination advertisements, a flag is set for all DAO
                    entries in the routing table.
</li>
<li>If the flag has already been set for a DAO entry, the
                    retry count is incremented.
</li>
<li>If a DAO message is received to confirm the entry, the
                    entry is refreshed and the flag and count may be
                    cleared.
</li>
<li>If at least one entry has reached a threshold value and
                    the RemoveTimer is not running, the entry is considered to
                    be probably gone and the RemoveTimer is started.
</li>
<li>When the RemoveTimer elapse, DAO messages with lifetime
                    0, i.e. no-DAOs, are sent to explicitly inform DA parents
                    that the entries which have reached the threshold are no
                    longer available, and the related routing states may be
                    propagated and cleaned up.
</li>
</ul>
<li>The RemoveTimer has a duration of min
                  (MAX_DESTROY_INTERVAL, TBD(DIO Trickle Timer Interval)).

Multicast Destination Advertisement Messages</h3>

<p>It is also possible for a node to multicast a DAO message to
            the link-local scope all-nodes multicast address FF02::1. This
            message will be received by all node listening in range of the
            emitting node. The objective is to enable direct P2P
            communication, between destinations directly supported by
            neighboring nodes, without needing the RPL routing structure to
            relay the packets.
</p>
<p>A multicast DAO message MUST be used only to advertise
            information about self, i.e. prefixes in the Connected list or
            addresses owned by this node. This would typically be a multicast
            group that this node is listening to or a global address owned by
            this node, though it can be used to advertise any prefix owned by
            this node as well. A multicast DAO message is not used for routing
            and does not presume any DODAG relationship between the emitter
            and the receiver; it MUST NOT be used to relay information learned
            (e.g. information in the Reachable list) from another node;
            information obtained from a multicast DAO MAY be installed in the
            routing table and MAY be propagated by a router in unicast
            DAOs.
</p>
<p>A node receiving a multicast DAO message addressed to FF02::1
            MAY install prefixes contained in the DAO message in the routing
            table for local use. Such a node MUST NOT perform any other
            processing on the DAO message (i.e. such a node does not presume
            it is a DA parent).

Unicast Destination Advertisement Messages from Child to Parent</h3>

<p>When sending a destination advertisement to a DA parent, a node
            includes the DAOs for prefix entries not already reported (since
            the last DA Trigger from an DIO message) in the Reachable and
            Connected lists, as well as no-DAOs for all the entries in the
            Unreachable list. Depending on its policy and ability to retain
            routing state, the receiving node SHOULD keep a record of the
            reported DAO message. If the DAO message offers the best route to
            the prefix as determined by policy and other prefix records, the
            node SHOULD install a route to the prefix reported in the DAO
            message via the link local address of the reporting neighbor and
            it SHOULD further propagate the information in a DAO message.
</p>
<p>The DIO message from the DODAG root is used to synchronize the
            whole DODAG iteration, including the periodic reporting of
            destination advertisements back up the DODAG. Its period is
            expected to vary, depending on the configuration of the DIO
            trickle timer.
</p>
<p>When a node receives a DIO message over an LLN interface from a
            DA parent, the DelayDAO is armed to force a full update.
</p>
<p>When the node broadcasts a DIO message on an LLN interface, for
            all entries on that interface:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>If the entry is CONFIRMED, it goes PENDING with the retry
                count set to 0.
</li>
<li>If the entry is PENDING, the retry count is incremented. If
                it reaches a maximum threshold, the entry goes ELAPSED If at
                least one entry is ELAPSED at the end of the process: if the
                RemoveTimer is not running then it is armed with a jitter.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Since the DelayDAO timer has a duration that decreases with the
            depth, it is expected to receive all DAO messages from all
            children before the timer elapses and the full update is sent to
            the DA parents.
</p>
<p>Once the RemoveTimer is elapsed, the prefix entry is scheduled
            to be removed and moved to the Unreachable list if there are any
            DA parents that need to be informed of the change in status for
            the prefix, otherwise the prefix entry is cleaned up right away.
            The prefix entry is removed from the Unreachable list when no more
            DA parents need to be informed. This condition may be satisfied
            when a no-DAO is sent to all current DA parents indicating the
            loss of the prefix, and noting that in some cases parents may have
            been removed from the set of DA parents.

Aggregation of Prefixes by a Node</h3>

<p>There may be number of cases where a aggregation may be shared

            aggregation techniques with destination advertisements and improve
            scalability.
</p>
<p>Other cases might occur for which additional support is
            required:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>The aggregating node is attached within the sub-DAG of the
                nodes it is aggregating for.
</li>
<li>A node that is to be aggregated for is located somewhere
                else within the DODAG iteration, not in the sub-DAG of the

</li>
<li>A node that is to be aggregated for is located somewhere
                else in the LLN.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Consider a node M that is performing an aggregation, and a node
            N that is to be a member of the aggregation group. A node Z
            situated above the node M in the DODAG, but not above node N, will
            see the advertisements for the aggregation owned by M but not that
            of the individual prefix for N. Such a node Z will route all the
            packets for node N towards node M, but node M will have no route
            to the node N and will fail to forward.
</p>
<p>Additional protocols may be applied beyond the scope of this
            specification to dynamically elect/provision an aggregating node
            and groups of nodes eligible to be aggregated in order to provide

Loop Detection</h3>

<p>RPL loop avoidance mechanisms are kept simple and designed to
        minimize churn and states. Loops may form for a number of reasons,

</p>
<p>RPL loop detection uses information that is placed into the packet

<p>Instance IDs are used to avoid loops between DODAGs from

DAG Inconsistency Loop Detection</h3>

<p>The DODAG is inconsistent if the direction of a packet does not

            if it receives a packet with either: </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>the 'O' bit set (to down) from a node of a higher rank.
</p>
<p>the 'O' bit reset (for up) from a node of a lesser

</p>
<p>the 'S' bit set (to sibling) from a node of a different
                rank.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the DODAG root increments the DAG Sequence Number a
            temporary rank discontinuity may form between the next iteration
            and the prior iteration, in particular if nodes are adjusting
            their rank in the next iteration and deferring their migration
            into the next iteration. A router that is still a member of the
            prior iteration may choose to forward a packet to a (future)
            parent that is in the next iteration. In some cases this could
            cause the parent to detect an inconsistency because the
            rank-ordering in the prior iteration is not necessarily the same
            as in the next iteration and the packet may be judged to not be
            making forward progress. If the sending router is aware that the
            chosen successor has already joined the next iteration, then the
            sending router MUST update the SenderRank to INFINITE_RANK as it
            forwards the packets across the discontinuity into the next DODAG
            iteration in order to avoid a false detection of rank
            inconsistency.
</p>
<p>One inconsistency along the path is not considered as a
            critical error and the packet may continue. But a second detection
            along the path of a same packet should not occur and the packet is
            dropped.
</p>
<p>This process is controlled by the Rank-Error bit in the Flow
            Label. When an inconsistency, is detected on a packet, if the
            Rank-Error bit was not set then the Rank-Error bit is set. If it
            was set the packet is discarded and the trickle timer is
            reset.

<p>When a packet is forwarded along siblings, it cannot be checked

            generally sufficient to avoid loops. Based on that evidence, this

DAO Inconsistency Loop Detection and Recovery</h3>

<p>A DAO inconsistency happens when router that has an down DAO
            route via a child that is a remnant from an obsolete state that is
            not matched in the child. With DAO inconsistency loop recovery, a
            packet can be used to recursively explore and cleanup the obsolete
            DAO states along a sub-DAG.
</p>
<p>In a general manner, a packet that goes down should never go up
            again. So rather than routing up a packet with the down bit set,
            the router MUST discard the packet. If DAO inconsistency loop
            recovery is applied, then the router SHOULD send the packet to the
            parent that passed it with the Forwarding-Error 'F' bit set.

<a name="rfc.section.6.10"></a><h3>6.10.&nbsp;
Multicast Operation</h3>

<p>This section describes further the multicast routing operations
        over an IPv6 RPL network, and specifically how unicast DAOs can be
        used to relay group registrations up. Wherever the following text
        mentions MLD, one can read MLDv2 or v3.
</p>
<p>As is traditional, a listener uses a protocol such as MLD with a
        router to register to a multicast group.
</p>
<p>Along the path between the router and the DODAG root, MLD requests
        are mapped and transported as DAO messages within the RPL protocol;
        each hop coalesces the multiple requests for a same group as a single
        DAO message to the parent(s), in a fashion similar to proxy IGMP, but
        recursively between child router and parent up to the root.
</p>
<p>A router might select to pass a listener registration DAO message
        to its preferred parent only, in which case multicast packets coming
        back might be lost for all of its sub-DAG if the transmission fails
        over that link. Alternatively the router might select to copy
        additional parents as it would do for DAO messages advertising unicast
        destinations, in which case there might be duplicates that the router
        will need to prune.
</p>
<p>As a result, multicast routing states are installed in each router
        on the way from the listeners to the root, enabling the root to copy a
        multicast packet to all its children routers that had issued a DAO
        message including a DAO for that multicast group, as well as all the
        attached nodes that registered over MLD.
</p>
<p>For unicast traffic, it is expected that the grounded root of an
        DODAG terminates RPL and MAY redistribute the RPL routes over the
        external infrastructure using whatever routing protocol is used there.
        For multicast traffic, the root MAY proxy MLD for all the nodes
        attached to the RPL routers (this would be needed if the multicast
        source is located in the external infrastructure). For such a source,
        the packet will be replicated as it flows down the DODAG based on the
        multicast routing table entries installed from the DAO message.
</p>
<p>For a source inside the DODAG, the packet is passed to the
        preferred parents, and if that fails then to the alternates in the
        DODAG. The packet is also copied to all the registered children,
        except for the one that passed the packet. Finally, if there is a
        listener in the external infrastructure then the DODAG root has to
        further propagate the packet into the external infrastructure.
</p>
<p>As a result, the DODAG Root acts as an automatic proxy Rendezvous
        Point for the RPL network, and as source towards the Internet for all
        multicast flows started in the RPL LLN. So regardless of whether the
        root is actually attached to the Internet, and regardless of whether
        the DODAG is grounded or floating, the root can serve inner multicast
        streams at all times.

Maintenance of Routing Adjacency</h3>

<p>The selection of successors, along the default paths up along the
        DODAG, or along the paths learned from destination advertisements down
        along the DODAG, leads to the formation of routing adjacencies that
        require maintenance.
</p>
<p>In IGPs such as OSPF <a class='info' href='#RFC4915'>[RFC4915]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Psenak, P., Mirtorabi, S., Roy, A., Nguyen, L., and P. Pillay-Esnault, &ldquo;Multi-Topology (MT) Routing in OSPF,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> or IS-IS <a class='info' href='#RFC5120'>[RFC5120]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Przygienda, T., Shen, N., and N. Sheth, &ldquo;M-ISIS: Multi Topology (MT) Routing in Intermediate System to Intermediate Systems (IS-ISs),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>, the maintenance of a routing adjacency
        involves the use of Keepalive mechanisms (Hellos) or other protocols
        such as BFD (<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-bfd-base'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;bfd&#8209;base]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Katz, D. and D. Ward, &ldquo;Bidirectional Forwarding Detection,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>) and MANET
        Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-manet-nhdp'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;manet&#8209;nhdp]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Clausen, T., Dearlove, C., and J. Dean, &ldquo;Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP),&rdquo; October&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>). Unfortunately, such an approach
        is not desirable in constrained environments such as LLN and would
        lead to excessive control traffic in light of the data traffic with a
        negative impact on both link loads and nodes resources. Overhead to
        maintain the routing adjacency should be minimized. Furthermore, it is
        not always possible to rely on the link or transport layer to provide
        information of the associated link state. The network layer needs to
        fall back on its own mechanism.
</p>
<p>Thus RPL makes use of a different approach consisting of probing
        the neighbor using a Neighbor Solicitation message (see <a class='info' href='#RFC4861'>[RFC4861]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Narten, T., Nordmark, E., Simpson, W., and H. Soliman, &ldquo;Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6),&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>). The reception of a Neighbor Advertisement
        (NA) message with the "Solicited Flag" set is used to verify the
        validity of the routing adjacency. Such mechanism MAY be used prior to
        sending a data packet. This allows for detecting whether or not the
        routing adjacency is still valid, and should it not be the case,
        select another feasible successor to forward the packet.

Suggestions for Packet Forwarding</h3>

<p>When forwarding a packet to a destination, precedence is given to
      selection of a next-hop successor as follows:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>In the scope of this specification, it is preferred to select a
          successor from a DODAG iteration that matches the InstanceID marked
          in the IPv6 header of the packet being forwarded.
</li>
<li>If a local administrative preference favors a route that has been
          learned from a different routing protocol than RPL, then use that
          successor.
</li>
<li>If there is an entry in the routing table matching the
          destination that has been learned from a multicast destination
          advertisement (e.g. the destination is a one-hop neighbor), then use
          that successor.
</li>
<li>If there is an entry in the routing table matching the
          destination that has been learned from a unicast destination
          advertisement (e.g. the destination is located down the sub-DAG),
          then use that successor.
</li>
<li>If there is a DODAG iteration offering a route to a prefix
          matching the destination, then select one of those DODAG parents as
          a successor.
</li>
<li>If there is a DAG parent offering a default route then select
          that DAG parent as a successor.
</li>
<li>If there is a DODAG iteration offering a route to a prefix
          matching the destination, but all DAG parents have been tried and
          are temporarily unavailable (as determined by the forwarding
          procedure), then select a DAG sibling as a successor.
</li>
<li>Finally, if no DAG siblings are available, the packet is dropped.
          ICMP Destination Unreachable may be invoked. An inconsistency is
          detected.
</li>
</ol>

<p>TTL MUST be decremented when forwarding. If the packet is being
      forwarded via a sibling, then the TTL MAY be decremented more
      aggressively (by more than one) to limit the impact of possible
      loops.
</p>
<p>Note that the chosen successor MUST NOT be the neighbor that was the
      predecessor of the packet (split horizon), except in the case where it
      is intended for the packet to change from an up to an down flow, such as
      switching from DIO routes to DAO routes as the destination is
      neared.

Guidelines for Objective Functions</h3>

<p>An Objective Function (OF) allows for the selection of a DODAG to
      join, and a number of peers in that DAG as parents. The OF is used to
      compute an ordered list of parents. The OF is also responsible to
      compute the rank of the device within the DODAG iteration.
</p>
<p>The Objective Function is indicated in the DIO message using an
      Objective Code Point (OCP), as specified in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;routing&#8209;metrics]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vasseur, J., Kim, M., Networks, D., and H. Chong, &ldquo;Routing Metrics used for Path Calculation in Low Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>, and indicates the method that
      must be used to compute the DODAG (e.g. "minimize the path cost using
      the ETX metric and avoid `Blue' links"). The Objective Code Points are
      specified in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;routing&#8209;metrics]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vasseur, J., Kim, M., Networks, D., and H. Chong, &ldquo;Routing Metrics used for Path Calculation in Low Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> and related
      companion specifications.
</p>
<p>Most Objective Functions are expected to follow the same abstract
      behavior:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The parent selection is triggered each time an event indicates that
        a potential next hop information is updated. This might happen upon
        the reception of a DIO message, a timer elapse, or a trigger
        indicating that the state of a candidate neighbor has changed.
</li>
<li>An OF scans all the interfaces on the device. Although there may
        typically be only one interface in most application scenarios, there
        might be multiple of them and an interface might be configured to be
        usable or not for RPL operation. An interface can also be configured
        with a preference or dynamically learned to be better than another by
        some heuristics that might be link-layer dependent and are out of
        scope. Finally an interface might or not match a required criterion
        for an Objective Function, for instance a degree of security. As a
        result some interfaces might be completely excluded from the
        computation, while others might be more or less preferred.
</li>
<li>An OF scans all the candidate neighbors on the possible interfaces
        to check whether they can act as a router for a DODAG. There might be
        multiple of them and a candidate neighbor might need to pass some
        validation tests before it can be used. In particular, some link
        layers require experience on the activity with a router to enable the
        router as a next hop.
</li>
<li>An OF computes self's rank by adding the step of rank to that
        candidate to the rank of that candidate. The step of rank is computed
        by estimating the link as follows:
</li>
<ul class="text">
<li>The step of rank might vary from 1 to 16.
</li>
<ul class="text">
<li>1 indicates a unusually good link, for instance a link between
            powered devices in a mostly battery operated environment.
</li>
<li>4 indicates a `normal'/typical link, as qualified by the
            implementation.
</li>
<li>16 indicates a link that can hardly be used to forward any
            packet, for instance a radio link with quality indicator or
            expected transmission count that is close to the acceptable
            threshold.
</li>
</ul>
<li>Candidate neighbors that would cause self's rank to increase are
          ignored
</li>
</ul>
<li>Candidate neighbors that advertise an OF incompatible with the set
        of OF specified by the policy functions are ignored.
</li>
<li>As it scans all the candidate neighbors, the OF keeps the current
        best parent and compares its capabilities with the current candidate
        neighbor. The OF defines a number of tests that are critical to reach
        the objective. A test between the routers determines an order
        relation.
</li>
<ul class="text">
<li>If the routers are roughly equal for that relation then the next
          test is attempted between the routers,
</li>
<li>Else the best of the 2 becomes the current best parent and the
          scan continues with the next candidate neighbor
</li>
<li>Some OFs may include a test to compare the ranks that would
          result if the node joined either router
</li>
</ul>
<li>When the scan is complete, the preferred parent is elected and
        self's rank is computed as the preferred parent rank plus the step in
        rank with that parent.
</li>
<li>Other rounds of scans might be necessary to elect alternate parents
        and siblings. In the next rounds:
</li>
<ul class="text">
<li>Candidate neighbors that are not in the same DODAG are
          ignored
</li>
<li>Candidate neighbors that are of greater rank than self are
          ignored

<li>Candidate neighbors of an equal rank to self (siblings) are

</p>
<p>For each DODAG, a RPL implementation MUST allow for the

Policy Control</h3>

<p>DAG discovery enables nodes to implement different policies for

</p>
<p>A RPL implementation SHOULD allow configuring the set of
          acceptable or preferred Objective Functions (OF) referenced by their
          Objective Codepoints (OCPs) for a node to join a DODAG, and what
          action should be taken if none of a node's candidate neighbors
          advertise one of the configured allowable Objective Functions.
</p>
<p>A node in an LLN may learn routing information from different
          routing protocols including RPL. It is in this case desirable to
          control via administrative preference which route should be favored.
          An implementation SHOULD allow for specifying an administrative
          preference for the routing protocol from which the route was
          learned.
</p>
<p>A RPL implementation SHOULD allow for the configuration of the
          "Route Tag" field of the DAO messages according to a set of rules
          defined by policy.

Protocol Properties Overview</h3>

IPv6 Architecture</h3>

<p>RPL is strictly compliant with layered IPv6 architecture.
</p>
<p>Further, RPL is designed with consideration to the practical
          support and implementation of IPv6 architecture on devices which may
          operate under severe resource constraints, including but not limited
          to memory, processing power, energy, and communication. The RPL
          design does not presume high quality reliable links, and operates
          over lossy links (usually low bandwidth with low packet delivery
          success rate).

<a name="rfc.section.A.1.2"></a><h3>A.1.2.&nbsp;
Typical LLN Traffic Patterns</h3>

<p>Multipoint-to-Point (MP2P) and Point-to-multipoint (P2MP) traffic
          flows from nodes within the LLN from and to egress points are very
          common in LLNs. Low power and lossy network Border Router (LBR)
          nodes may typically be at the root of such flows, although such
          flows are not exclusively rooted at LBRs as determined on an
          application-specific basis. In particular, several applications such
          as building or home automation do require P2P (Point-to-Point)
          communication.
</p>
<p>As required by the aforementioned routing requirements documents,
          RPL supports the installation of multiple paths. The use of multiple
          paths include sending duplicated traffic along diverse paths, as
          well as to support advanced features such as Class of Service (CoS)
          based routing, or simple load balancing among a set of paths (which
          could be useful for the LLN to spread traffic load and avoid fast
          energy depletion on some, e.g. battery powered, nodes).
          Conceptually, multiple instances of RPL can be used to send traffic
          along different topology instances, the construction of which is
          governed by different Objective Functions (OF). Details of RPL
          operation in support of multiple instances are beyond the scope of
          the present specification.

<a name="rfc.section.A.1.3"></a><h3>A.1.3.&nbsp;
Constraint Based Routing</h3>

<p>The RPL design supports constraint based routing, based on a set
          of routing metrics and constraints. The routing metrics and
          constraints for links and nodes with capabilities supported by RPL
          are specified in a companion document to this specification, <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;routing&#8209;metrics]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vasseur, J., Kim, M., Networks, D., and H. Chong, &ldquo;Routing Metrics used for Path Calculation in Low Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>. RPL signals the
          metrics, constraints, and related Objective Functions (OFs) in use
          in a particular implementation by means of an Objective Code Point
          (OCP). Both the routing metrics, constraints, and the OF help
          determine the construction of the Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)
          using a distributed path computation algorithm.

        addressed as RPL is further specified.

Examples</h3>

<p>Consider the example LLN physical topology in <a class='info' href='#LLNExample'>Figure&nbsp;13<span> (</span><span class='info'>Example LLN Topology</span><span>)</span></a>. In this example the links depicted are all
      usable L2 links. Suppose that all links are equally usable, and that the
      implementation specific policy function is simply to minimize hops. This
      LLN physical topology then yields the DAG depicted in <a class='info' href='#DAGExample'>Figure&nbsp;14<span> (</span><span class='info'>Example DAG</span><span>)</span></a>, where the links depicted are the edges
      toward DAG parents. This topology includes one DAG, rooted by an LBR
      node (LBR) at rank 1. The LBR node will issue DIO messages, as governed
      by a trickle timer. Nodes (11), (12), (13), have selected (LBR) as their
      only parent, attached to the DAG at rank 2, and periodically multicast
      DIOs. Node (22) has selected (11) and (12) in its DAG parent set, and
      advertises itself at rank 3. Node (22) thus has a set of DAG parents
      {(11), (12)} and siblings {((21), (23)}.

<p>Note that the links depicted represent the usable L2
        connectivity available in the LLN. For example, Node (31) can
        communicate directly with its neighbors, Nodes (21), (22), (32), and
        (41). Node (31) cannot communicate directly with any other nodes, e.g.
        (33), (23), (42). In this example these links offer bidirectional
        communication, and `bad' links are not depicted.

Destination Advertisement</h3>

<p>Consider the example DAG depicted in <a class='info' href='#DAGExample'>Figure&nbsp;14<span> (</span><span class='info'>Example DAG</span><span>)</span></a>. Suppose that Nodes (22) and (32) are
        unable to record routing state. Suppose that Node (42) is able to
        perform prefix aggregation on behalf of Nodes (53), (54), and
        (55).
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Node (53) would send a DAO message to Node (42), indicating the
            availability of destination (53).
</li>
<li>Node (54) and Node (55) would similarly send DAO messages to
            Node (42) indicating their own destinations.
</li>
<li>Node (42) would collect and store the routing state for
            destinations (53), (54), and (55).
</li>
<li>In this example, Node (42) may then be capable of representing
            destinations (42), (53), (54), and (55) in the aggregation
            (42').
</li>
<li>Node (42) sends a DAO message advertising destination (42') to
            Node 32.
</li>
<li>Node (32) does not want to maintain any routing state, so it
            adds onto to the Reverse Route Stack in the DAO message and passes
            it on to Node (22) as (42'):[(42)]. It may send a separate DAO
            message to indicate destination (32).
</li>
<li>Node (22) does not want to maintain any routing state, so it
            adds on to the Reverse Route Stack in the DAO message and passes
            it on to Node (12) as (42'):[(42), (32)]. It also relays the DAO
            message containing destination (32) to Node 12 as (32):[(32)], and
            finally may send a DAO message for itself indicating destination
            (22).
</li>
<li>Node (12) is capable to maintain routing state again, and
            receives the DAO messages from Node (22). Node (12) then
            learns:
</li>
<ul class="text">
<li>Destination (22) is available via Node (22)
</li>
<li>Destination (32) is available via Node (22) and the piecewise
              source route to (32)
</li>
<li>Destination (42') is available via Node (22) and the
              piecewise source route to (32), (42').
</li>
</ul>
<li>Node (12) sends DAO messages to (LBR), allowing (LBR) to learn
            routes to the destinations (12), (22), (32), and (42'). (42),
            (53), (54), and (55) are available via the aggregation (42'). It
            is not necessary for Node (12) to propagate the piecewise source
            routes to (LBR).

Example: DAG Parent Selection</h3>

<p>For example, suppose that a node (N) is not attached to any DAG,
        and that it is in range of nodes (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E). Let all
        nodes be configured to use an OCP which defines a policy such that ETX
        is to be minimized and paths with the attribute `Blue' should be
        avoided. Let the rank computation indicated by the OCP simply reflect
        the ETX aggregated along the path. Let the links between node (N) and
        its neighbors (A-E) all have an ETX of 1 (which is learned by node (N)
        through some implementation specific method). Let node (N) be
        configured to send RPL DIS messages to probe for nearby DAGs.
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Node (N) transmits a RPL DIS message.
</li>
<li>Node (B) responds. Node (N) investigates the DIO message, and
            learns that Node (B) is a member of DAGID 1 at rank 4, and not
            `Blue'. Node (N) takes note of this, but is not yet confident.
</li>
<li>Similarly, Node (N) hears from Node (A) at rank 9, Node (C) at
            rank 5, and Node (E) at rank 4.
</li>
<li>Node (D) responds. Node (D) has a DIO message that indicates
            that it is a member of DAGID 1 at rank 2, but it carries the
            attribute `Blue'. Node (N)'s policy function rejects Node (D), and
            no further consideration is given.
</li>
<li>This process continues until Node (N), based on implementation
            specific policy, builds enough confidence to trigger a decision to
            join DAGID 1. Let Node (N) determine its most preferred parent to
            be Node (E).
</li>
<li>Node (N) adds Node (E) (rank 4) to its set of DAG parents for
            DAGID 1. Following the mechanisms specified by the OCP, and given
            that the ETX is 1 for the link between (N) and (E), Node (N) is
            now at rank 5 in DAGID 1.
</li>
<li>Node (N) adds Node (B) (rank 4) to its set of DAG parents for
            DAGID 1.
</li>
<li>Node (N) is a sibling of Node (C), both are at rank 5.
</li>
<li>Node (N) may now forward traffic intended for the default
            destination upwards along DAGID 1 via nodes (B) and (E). In some
            cases, e.g. if nodes (B) and (E) are tried and fail, node (N) may
            also choose to forward traffic to its sibling node (C), without
            making upwards progress but with the intention that node (C) or a
            following successor can make upwards progress. Should Node (C) not
            have a viable parent, it should never send the packet back to Node
            (N) (to avoid a 2-node loop).

<p>Consider the example depicted in <a class='info' href='#DAGMaintenance'>Figure&nbsp;15<span> (</span><span class='info'>DAG Maintenance</span><span>)</span></a>-1. In this example, Node (A) is
        attached to a DAG at some rank d. Node (A) is a DAG parent of Nodes
        (B) and (C). Node (C) is a DAG parent of Node (D). There is also an
        undirected sibling link between Nodes (B) and (C).
</p>
<p>In this example, Node (C) may safely forward to Node (A) without
        creating a loop. Node (C) may not safely forward to Node (D),
        contained within it's own sub-DAG, without creating a loop. Node (C)
        may forward to Node (B) in some cases, e.g. the link (C)-&gt;(A) is
        temporarily unavailable, but with some chance of creating a loop (e.g.
        if multiple nodes in a set of siblings start forwarding `sideways' in
        a cycle) and requiring the intervention of additional mechanisms to
        detect and break the loop.
</p>
<p>Consider the case where Node (C) hears a DIO message from a Node
        (Z) at a lesser rank and superior position in the DAG than node (A).
        Node (C) may safely undergo the process to evict node (A) from its DAG
        parent set and attach directly to Node (Z) without creating a loop,
        because its rank will decrease.
</p>
<p>Now consider the case where the link (C)-&gt;(A) becomes nonviable,
        and node (C) must move to a deeper rank within the DAG:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Node (C) must first detach from the DAG by removing Node (A)
            from its DAG parent set, leaving an empty DAG parent set. Node (C)
            may become the root of its own floating, less preferred, DAG.
</li>
<li>Node (D), hearing a modified DIO message from Node (C), follows
            Node (C) into the floating DAG. This is depicted in <a class='info' href='#DAGMaintenance'>Figure&nbsp;15<span> (</span><span class='info'>DAG Maintenance</span><span>)</span></a>-2. In general, any node with no
            other options in the sub-DAG of Node (C) will follow Node (C) into
            the floating DAG, maintaining the structure of the sub-DAG.
</li>
<li>Node (C) hears a DIO message with an incremented
            DAGSequenceNumber from Node (B) and determines it is able to
            rejoin the grounded DAG by reattaching at a deeper rank to Node
            (B). Node (C) adds Node (B) to its DAG parent set. Node (C) has
            now safely moved deeper within the grounded DAG without creating
            any loops.
</li>
<li>Node (D), and any other sub-DAG of Node (C), will hear the
            modified DIO message sourced from Node (C) and follow Node (C) in
            a coordinated manner to reattach to the grounded DAG. The final
            DAG is depicted in <a class='info' href='#DAGMaintenance'>Figure&nbsp;15<span> (</span><span class='info'>DAG Maintenance</span><span>)</span></a>-3

<p>Consider the example depicted in <a class='info' href='#Greedy'>Figure&nbsp;16<span> (</span><span class='info'>Greedy DAG Parent Selection</span><span>)</span></a>. A
        DAG is depicted in 3 different configurations. A usable link between
        (B) and (C) exists in all 3 configurations. In <a class='info' href='#Greedy'>Figure&nbsp;16<span> (</span><span class='info'>Greedy DAG Parent Selection</span><span>)</span></a>-1, Node (A) is a DAG parent for Nodes (B) and
        (C), and (B)--(C) is a sibling link. In <a class='info' href='#Greedy'>Figure&nbsp;16<span> (</span><span class='info'>Greedy DAG Parent Selection</span><span>)</span></a>-2, Node (A) is a DAG parent for Nodes (B) and
        (C), and Node (B) is also a DAG parent for Node (C). In <a class='info' href='#Greedy'>Figure&nbsp;16<span> (</span><span class='info'>Greedy DAG Parent Selection</span><span>)</span></a>-3, Node (A) is a DAG parent for Nodes (B) and
        (C), and Node (C) is also a DAG parent for Node (B).
</p>
<p>If a RPL node is too greedy, in that it attempts to optimize for an
        additional number of parents beyond its preferred parent, then an
        instability can result. Consider the DAG illustrated in <a class='info' href='#Greedy'>Figure&nbsp;16<span> (</span><span class='info'>Greedy DAG Parent Selection</span><span>)</span></a>-1. In this example, Nodes (B) and (C) may most
        prefer Node (A) as a DAG parent, but are operating under the greedy
        condition that will try to optimize for 2 parents.
</p>
<p>When the preferred parent selection causes a node to have only one
        parent and no siblings, the node may decide to insert itself at a
        slightly higher rank in order to have at least one sibling and thus an
        alternate forwarding solution. This does not deprive other nodes of a
        forwarding solution and this is considered acceptable greediness.
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Let <a class='info' href='#Greedy'>Figure&nbsp;16<span> (</span><span class='info'>Greedy DAG Parent Selection</span><span>)</span></a>-1 be the initial
            condition.
</li>
<li>Suppose Node (C) first is able to leave the DAG and rejoin at a
            lower rank, taking both Nodes (A) and (B) as DAG parents as
            depicted in <a class='info' href='#Greedy'>Figure&nbsp;16<span> (</span><span class='info'>Greedy DAG Parent Selection</span><span>)</span></a>-2. Now Node (C) is
            deeper than both Nodes (A) and (B), and Node (C) is satisfied to
            have 2 DAG parents.
</li>
<li>Suppose Node (B), in its greediness, is willing to receive and
            process a DIO message from Node (C) (against the rules of RPL),
            and then Node (B) leaves the DAG and rejoins at a lower rank,
            taking both Nodes (A) and (C) as DAG parents. Now Node (B) is
            deeper than both Nodes (A) and (C) and is satisfied with 2 DAG
            parents.
</li>
<li>Then Node (C), because it is also greedy, will leave and rejoin
            deeper, to again get 2 parents and have a lower rank then both of
            them.
</li>
<li>Next Node (B) will again leave and rejoin deeper, to again get
            2 parents
</li>
<li>And again Node (C) leaves and rejoins deeper...
</li>
<li>The process will repeat, and the DAG will oscillate between
            <a class='info' href='#Greedy'>Figure&nbsp;16<span> (</span><span class='info'>Greedy DAG Parent Selection</span><span>)</span></a>-2 and <a class='info' href='#Greedy'>Figure&nbsp;16<span> (</span><span class='info'>Greedy DAG Parent Selection</span><span>)</span></a>-3 until the nodes count to infinity and
            restart the cycle again.
</li>
<li>This cycle can be averted through mechanisms in RPL: 
<ul class="text">
<li>Nodes (B) and (C) stay at a rank sufficient to attach to
                their most preferred parent (A) and don't go for any deeper
                (worse) alternate parents (Nodes are not greedy)
</li>
<li>Nodes (B) and (C) do not process DIO messages from nodes
                deeper than themselves (because such nodes are possibly in
                their own sub-DAGs)

        the most desirable downward paths for the specific application
        scenario (in part because the DAG links may not be symmetric). It may
        be desired to support within RPL the discovery and installation of
        more direct routes `across' the DAG. Such mechanisms need to be

Destination Advertisement / DAO Fan-out</h3>

<p>When DAO messages are relayed to more than one DAG parent, in some

        conveying information about the same destination flow upwards along
        the DAG. It is desirable to bound/limit the multiplication/fan-out of

        in the face of links that may not be symmetric.

<p>In general, the utility of providing redundancy along downwards
        routes by sending DAO messages to more than one parent is under

</p>
<p>The use of suitable triggers, such as the `D' bit, to trigger DA
        operation within an affected sub-DAG, is under investigation. Further,
        the ability to limit scope of the affected depth within the sub-DAG is
        under investigation (e.g. if a stateful node can proxy for all nodes
        `behind' it, then there may be no need to propagate the triggered `D'
        bit further).
