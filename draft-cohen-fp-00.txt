Abstract


This is a new protocol now being used to communicate within a local area
network.  It is called "FP" (rumored to stand for Frame Protocol) and is
intended for use by communicating parties on the same LAN segment. 

 


"FP" (rumored to stand for Frame Protocol) uses an Ethernet or similar
LAN technology to communicate short burst traffic between communicating
parties.

Ethernet byte sequences starting with a first octet (byte) of 'FC' are
used in an Ethernet-level protocol for communication between computers
on the same LAN segment.  Subprotocols are defined by the second octet
(byte).  Current subcodes are:

        00      Reserved - never to be used
        01      Start of session
        02      Data in session
        03      End of session

Further codes are anticipated over time.

FP Ethernet packet:
	+----+----+----+----+-
	| FC | Op | Content...
	+----+----+----+----+-

FP Ethernet Start of session packet:
	+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
	| FC | 01 | Session Idendity  | Timestamp                             |
	+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

FP Ethernet Data in session packet:

	+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
	| FC | 02 | Session Idendity  | Timestamp                             |Content...
	+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

FP Ethernet End of session packet:
	+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
	| FC | 03 | Session Idendity  | Timestamp                             |
