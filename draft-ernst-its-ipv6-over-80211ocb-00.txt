1.  Introduction

   In this document the mapping of link-scoped multicast IPv6 addresses
   to MAC addresses of 802.11-OCB is proposed.

   IPv6 protocols often make use of IPv6 multicast addresses in the
   destination field of IPv6 headers.  For example, an ICMPv6 link-
   scoped Neighbor Advertisement is sent to the IPv6 address ff02::1
   denoted "all-nodes" address.  When transmitting these packets on
   802.11-OCB links it is necessary to map the IPv6 address to a MAC
   address.

   The same mapping requirement applies to the link-scoped multicast
   addresses of other IPv6 protocols as well.  In DHCPv6, the
   "All_DHCP_Servers" IPv6 multicast address ff02::1:2, and in OSPF the
   "All_SPF_Routers" IPv6 multicast address ff02::5, need to be mapped
   on a multicast MAC address.

   Other than link-scope addressing, it may be possible to conceive
   other IPv6 multicast addresses for specific use in vehicular
   communication scenarios.  For example, certain vehicle types (or road
   infrastructure equipment) in a zone can be denoted by an IPv6
   multicast address: "all-yellow-taxis-in-street", or "all-uber-cars".
   This helps sending a message to these particular types of vehicles,
   instead of sending to all vehicles in that same street.  The
   protocols SDP and LLDP could further be used in managing this as a
   service.

   It may be possible to map parts of other-than-link-scope IPv6
   multicast address (e.g. parts of a global-scope IPv6 multicast
   address) into parts of a 802.11-OCB MAC address.  This may help
   certain IPv6 operations.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   OCB - Outside the Context of a Basic-Service Set ID (BSSID).

   802.11-OCB - IEEE 802.11-2012 text flagged by "dot11OCBActivated".
   This means: IEEE 802.11e for quality of service; 802.11j-2004 for
   half-clocked operations; and 802.11p for operation in the 5.9 GHz
   band and in mode OCB.

7.  Address Mapping -- Unicast

8.  Address Mapping -- Multicast

   An IPv6 packet with a multicast destination address DST, consisting
   of the sixteen octets DST[1] through DST[16], is transmitted to the
   IEEE 802.11-OCB MAC multicast address whose first two octets are the
   value 0x3333 and whose last four octets are the last four octets of
   DST.

   A Group ID TBD of length 112bits may be requested from IANA; this
   Group ID signifies "All 80211OCB Interfaces Address".  Only the least
   32 significant bits of this "All 80211OCB Interfaces Address" will be
   mapped to and from a MAC multicast address.

   Alternatively, instead of 0x3333 address other addresses reserved at
   IEEE can be considered.  The Group MAC addresses reserved at IEEE are
   listed at https://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/grpmac/
   public.html (address browsed in July 2016).
