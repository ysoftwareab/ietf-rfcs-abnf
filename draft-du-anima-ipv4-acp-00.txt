                 Autonomic Control Plane Based on IPv4
                       draft-du-anima-ipv4-acp-00

Abstract

   This document describes an Autonomic Control Plane (ACP) based on
   IPv4.  The ACP is an overlay control plane logically separate from
   the data plane.  It is established autonomically independent of the
   operator's configurations.  This document introduces the approach of
   using IPv4 addresses for the routing in an ACP.

1.  Introduction

   Autonomic Control Plane (ACP) provides a secure and always-on
   communication plane.  It is one of the infrastructure functions for
   Autonomic Network (AN).  Autonomic Service Agents in the autonomic
   network can use ACP to discover or negotiate.  The background to
   Autonomic Network is described in [RFC7575] and [RFC7576].

   An IPv6-based ACP has been proposed in
   [I-D.behringer-anima-autonomic-control-plane], and it is suggested
   that ACP should rely exclusively on IPv6.  In this approach, the ACP
   is organized as a pure IPv6 network, while the network data plane can
   be based on any protocol, including IPv4 or IPv6.  The advantages of
   this approach are no need to support dual stack IPv4/v6, better self-
   configuration ability of IPv6, etc.

   IPv6 is the best candidate for the ACP, but it should not be
   precluded to provide an IPv4 based ACP for the operator as an option.
   When the network data plane is running IPv4, an IPv4 based ACP can
   offer better compatibility, which means no need to run IPv4 in the
   data plane, and IPv6 in the control plane.

   The purpose of this document is to address the issues that arise if
   an IPv4 based ACP is considered needed, including clarifying the
   additional requirements and solutions compared to the IPv6 one.

   {Editor notes: an operator, who has difficulties to upgrade the whole
   network to IPv6, maybe wants an IPv4 based ACP to simplify the
   management jobs.  This document makes sense for the network operators
   who have an essential requirement to simple the network management,

   but have a less urgent requirement to upgrade to IPv6.  Hence,
   defining an IPv4 based ACP is helpful for the deployment of Autonomic
   Network, or at least harmless.}

   {Editor notes: It should be noticed that ACP can work while the data
   plane is unchanged, i.e., remaining IPv4, because ACP and AN have
   been designed as transparent as possible, which means the operator
   will rarely notice them.  However, it is not always true in practice.
   The network operator may need to maintain two address systems in this
   case, for examples, when developing or debugging, or in network
   monitoring, or if connecting to an IPv4 server for the ACP is
   needed.}

2.  Requirements Language and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119] when they appear in ALL CAPS.  When these words are not in
   ALL CAPS (such as "should" or "Should"), they have their usual
   English meanings, and are not to be interpreted as [RFC2119] key
   words.

   Autonomic Control Plane:  A self-forming, self-managing and self-
      protecting control plane used in the Autonomic Network, which is
      inband on the network, yet as independent as possible of
      configuration, addressing and routing problems.

   Autonomic Function:  A feature or function which requires no
      configuration, and can derive all required information either
      through self-knowledge, discovery or through Intent.

   Autonomic Node:  A node which employs exclusively Autonomic
      Functions.

   Autonomic Network:  A network containing exclusively Autonomic Nodes.
      It may contain one or several Autonomic Domains.

   Autonomic Service Agent:  An agent implemented on an Autonomic Node
      which implements an Autonomic Function.

3.  Overview

   Steps of constructing an IPv4 based Autonomic Control Plane are as
   follows.

   o  Each Autonomic Node has a vendor specific Unique Device Identifier
      (UDI) or IDevID certificate, based on which it joins the autonomic
      domain, and obtains a domain certificate.

   o  Based on the domain certificate, an Autonomic Node authenticates
      the discovered neighbors and establishes a secure tunnel with each
      of them.

   o  Each Autonomic Node maintains a virtual routing and forwarding
      instance, and owns a loopback IPv4 addresses.

   o  Through the tunnels established in the previous steps, a routing
      protocol is run, and each Autonomic Node establishes its ACP
      routing table which is separated from the global routing table.

   The following figurer illustrates the ACP.

        Figure 1 Overview of the IPv4 Based Autonomic Control Plane

   IPv4 has a link-local address mechanism defined in [RFC3927].  Either
   those link-local addresses can be used for an IPSec tunnel to be
   established, or the MACSec channels can be used here to encrypt the
   control traffic hop-by-hop.

4.  Issues Needed to be Considered and Possible Solutions

Internet-Draft               IPv4 based ACP                    July 2015


4.1.  Link-local Address

   In IPv6, a network node will acquire a valid link-local address
   without any pre-configuration.  These link-local addresses are used
   by the Autonomic Node to set up tunnels with their neighbors in IPv6
   based ACP.

   As mentioned before, IPv4 has a link-local address mechanism.
   However, according to [RFC3927], this address is only used when no IP
   address is manually configured on the interface and no DHCP server is
   found.  In addition, that document does not recommend that IPv4 link-
   local addresses and routable addresses be configured simultaneously
   on the same interface.

   Therefore, it brings in some troubles for an IPv4 ACP to establish a
   secure channel with neighbors using link-local addresses.

4.2.  Link-local Multicast

   In the IPv6 ACP, link-local multicast is suggested to be used in the
   adjacency discovery.  In IPv4 ACP, perhaps a multicast in L2 may be
   considered instead of the link-local multicast based on the IPv6
   link-local address.

4.3.  Addressing Inside the ACP

   In the IPv6 ACP, Unique Local Addresses (ULA) specified in [RFC4193]
   is suggested to be used as the overlay addresses of autonomic nodes
   in the ACP.

   IPv4 has the private IP address space, such as 10/8; however, it is
   maybe not statistically unique inside the AS.

4.4.  Autonomic Address Configuration

   In the IPv6 ACP, the ULA address can be self-configured.  This
   feature is important in the Autonomic network.  However, there is no
   mechanism for self-configuration of IPv4 addresses.  The length of an
   IPv4 address is much shorter than an IPv6 one, which causes a larger
   possbility of confilcting in the address self-configuration.

4.5.  Routing Protocol

   In the IPv6 ACP, RPL is proposed for the routing protocol.  However,
   it does not have an IPv4 version.  Perhaps OSPF or ISIS can be used
   in an IPv4 ACP.
