               Policies and dynamic data migration in DC
              draft-gu-dc-management-problem-statement-00

Abstract

   Virtualization provides Data Center with feasibility and improves the
   utilization of limited physical resource, e.g. switches/routers,
   servers and links.  Virtual machines (VM) are allowed to migrate to
   any place in the Data Center.  A variety of policies (e.g.  ACL,
   firewalls, load balancers, IPS and QoS) are deployed in Data Center
   to guarantee the SLA the provider signed with their clients.  Dynamic
   information, such as TCP Connection Table, dynamic ACLs and cumulated
   data, is generated on network devices.  In order to keep running
   services uninterrupted while VM migrating, relevant policies and
   dynamic information, also need to migrate with VM.

   This document describes some examples of the policies and dynamic
   information that need to migrate with VM, the influence if they are
   not migrated with VM, the problems that need to consider when migrate
   polices and dynamic information.  It also describes some existing
   network management protocols standardized by IETF and the advantages
   and disadvantages of them for operating policies and dynamic
   information migration respectively.  The goal is to justify that it
   is necessary for IETF to make effort on policy and dynamic
   information migration for large virtualized Data Center.

1.  Introduction

   Data centers can host tens or even thousands of different
   applications.  Some are simple applications such as web servers
   providing static content, while some may be very complex, e.g.
   e-commerce, that requiring all around privacy protection and data
   security.  Clients of Data Center, unlike server hosting clients,
   raise more strict QoS and Security requirements.  Clients may sign
   Service Level Agreement (SLA) with Data Center Provider to make sure
   their requirement can be guaranteed.  To satisfy different level of
   security requirements and to manage and improve the performance of
   these applications, data centers typically deploy a large variety of
   middleboxes, including firewalls, load balancers, SSL offloaders, web
   caches, and intrusion prevention boxes.

   To satisfy QoS requirements, Data Center also implement QoS mechanism
   as ISP network.  For example, to deploy polices on Switches to
   execute traffic classification and marking.  IEEE 802.1 DCB working
   group defines a series of standards to guarantee quality of service.

      802.1Qaz - Enhanced Transmission Selection

      802.1Qbb - Priority-based Flow Control

   Without regard to mobile network, the existing DC network management
   has a pre-assumption that the end hosts will not move.  If an end
   host moves, because the physical link has to break down and the
   service also has to break down, the network can treat it as two
   separated parts: one host leave the network and another host join the
   network.

   Server Virtualization and Virtual Machine Migration changes the
   situation and break the preassumption.  Server Virtualization is not
   a new technology.  But, because Cloud services become popular, which
   requires flexible resource assignment and effectively resource
   integration, server virtualization revitalizes again.  Using server
   virtualization technologies, network adminitrator can reduce
   networking cost.  To support the same volume of services, fewer
   network devices, servers and links are required than before.
   Multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) are established within a single
   physical server and the VMs are allowed to relocate to a different
   servers within the same subnet of Data Center, or even among
   different sites of a Data Center.  This is so called VM Migration.
   VM Migration brings flexibility to Data Center, meanwhile it makes
   network management more complex and challenging.

Internet-Draft  Policies and dynamic data migration in DC     March 2011


   While VM migrates, a very important requirement is that running
   services on the VM mustn't been interrupted.  Though a 'zero delay'
   on running services is not realistic, but the services should be able
   to continue after a very short delay.

   In order to avoid service interruption and minimize delay on running
   services, polices and dynamic information on network devices must be
   migrated timely and accurately.  The policies and dynamic information
   includes those on switches, routers and middleboxes.

   In the following section, we describe the policies and dynamic
   information migration on several example network devices.  The
   influence to running services if they are not migrated accurately and
   timely.  Then we will introduce the limitations of existing network
   management protocol.


2.  Terminologies and concepts

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Source Network Device, Source switch, or Source device: the network
   device/switch/device from where the VM migrates.  I.E. VM is
   originally located under the source network device/switch/device.

   Destination Network Device, Destination switch, or Destination
   device: the network device/switch/device to where the VM migrates.
   I.E. VM is relocated to the destination network device/switch/device.

   TCP connection table: A table containing TCP connection-specific
   information.


3.  Policies on several network devices

   In this draft, our discussion using the following figure as an
   example networking.  The links between AGG1/AGG2 and Gateway2, AGG3/
   AGG4 and Gateway1 are omitted for simplicity. the new VM1 under
   Server4 represents the VM1 after migration.  VM1 and new VM1 don't
   exist at the same time.  In the real world, the networking of DC
   could be different.

3.1.  Policies and configurations

   SLA is parsed into a collection of polices, which can be described by
   natural languages or mathematics fomula.  Then policies are
   represented by specific configurations on different network elements,
   e.g. physical ports on routers and switches.  In this draft, we
   discuss the migration of policies, but the policies migration also
   implies the migration of configurations on network devices, because
   configurations are embodiment of policies.

   Policies that need to migrate with VM are those can influence VM's
   running services.  The policies could be different on different
   network devices.  For example, it can be static Access Control Lists
   on Access switches, QoS on switches and routers, security rules on
   Firewalls, etc.

   Take Access Control List as an example.  Figure 1 shows the influence

   of lack of ACLs on destination switch.  There is an ACL 100 on source
   switch (Switch1) deny all packets from IP subnet 10.138.3.0 to
   Internet.  And another ACL 101 allows IP Address 10.138.3.1, VM1's IP
   Address, to send packets to Internet.  VM1 has a running service on
   it.  During service provisioning, VM1 is migrated to Server4 under
   Switch4, Where there is no ACL 100 and ACL 101.  VM1's IP Address
   falls into a default ACL which deny all unmatching packets.  As a
   result, packets belonging to the running services are dropped, hence
   the running service is interrupted.

4.  Dynamic Information and the influence if lack or unaccurate

   Network Manager (NM) can configure static configuration on network
   devices.  Except for the static configuration, some dynamic
   information could also be recorded and processed by network devices.
   TCP connection table is an obvious example.  Normally, TCP Connection
   Table is not configured by NM, but is generated by network devices,
   e.g.  Firewalls, by looking into the packets passing them.  TCP

Internet-Draft  Policies and dynamic data migration in DC     March 2011


   Connection Table can be used for forwarding and security reasons.
   Another example is cumulated data, e.g. how many packets/TCP
   connecition requests an end host has sent.  This information can only
   be generated by network devices according to real traffic.
   Configurations could be generated dynamically by network devices
   themselves according to the dynamic informaiton, e.g.  Dynamic ACLs.

4.1.  TCP connection tables

   A typical TCP Connection Table includes the following data:

      tcpConnState: The state of this TCP connection.

      tcpConnLocalAddress: The local IP address for this TCP connection.

      tcpConnLocalPort: The local port number for this TCP connection.

      tcpConnRemAddress: The remote IP address for this TCP connection.

      tcpConnRemPort: The remote port number for this TCP connection.

   A TCP Connectin Table could also includes the following information:

      Sequence Number: the sequence number in the packet header the
      sender is going to send.

      Acknowledgement Number: the sequence number in the packet header
      the receiver is hoping to receive.

      Idle time: the time that the tcp connection table hasn't been
      updated.

4.1.1.  If TCP Connection Table isn't migrated

   Assuming TCP Connection Table item is generated for VM1 on
   Firewall-A, the information is as follows:

      tcpConnState == Established

      tcpConnLocalAddress == 10.138.3.1

      tcpConnLocalPort == 1234

      tcpConnRemAddress: == 192.167.22.3

      tcpConnRemPort == 4321

   Assuming VM1 is migrated to Server4 under Switch4, without TCP

   Connection Table migration.  In order to keep the running service
   uninterrupted, the IP Address of VM1 will keep unchanged.  The
   packets belonging to this TCP Connection will continue coming, which
   will pass Firewall-B, instead of Firewall-A.  Because there is no TCP
   Connection Table for VM1 on Firewall-B, the following packets
   belonging to the TCP Connection will be dropped, hence the running
   service is broken down.

4.1.2.  If TCP Connection Table is not accurately migrated

   VM migration needs a period to finish memory and register copy.
   Fig.3 shows the VMware VMotion process.  There are three points we
   should pay attention to.

      Pre-copy period: VM begins to prepare for migration.  In this
      period, VM pre-copy memory state to the new VM on destination
      device.  The original VM is still power on and service is still
      running, which means the memory and register could keep changing.
      The new VM is power-on.

      VM not running period: The end phase of memory copy.  In this
      period, original VM stop running service, the memory will not
      change.  Original VM finish copying the rest changed memory and
      register to new VM.  New VM is still power-on.

      VM power-off point: After original VM receives the OK message from
      new VM, it turns off the power, and meanwhile the new memory
      starts to run.

   We can see that it's unrealistic to make a 'zero delay' VM migration,
   because there is at least about 1 second period (VM not running
   period) when neither VM is running.

   Assuming there is a NM can GET and SET dynamic information.  The NM
   GET dynamic information at Time A, and finish SET at Time B. At Time
   A, the Sequence Number of VM1's TCP Connection is 99.  After NM GET
   dynamic information, VM1's TCP connection keeps transferring packets
   and Sequence Number increase to 110, until VM not running period
   begins.  During VM not running period, no TCP packet is acknowledged
   by VM1, so the Sequence Number is 110.  At Time B, the destination
   Firewall is SET by Sequence Number 99.  When new VM1 starts, the
   packets belonging to VM1's TCP connection comes to Firewall-B with
   Sequence Number 111.  Since the receiving Sequence Number doesn't
   equal to the Acknowleadge Sequence Number of Firewall-B, this packet
   will be dropped and the running service is broken down.

4.2.  Cumulated data

   One example for cumulated data is unfinished TCP Connection
   established by a specific VM.  In order to avoid TCP SYN flood, a
   network device may control the unfinished TCP Connection established
   by a single end host by setting a threshold.  For example, the NM set
   the threshold to 5, and VM1 has established 3 unfinished TCP
   connections.  If the cumulated TCP connection number isn't migrated
   to destination devices, the destination device will allow VM1 to
   establish up to 5 unfinished TCP connections.  For the single
   destination device, the unfinished TCP connections established by VM1
   is under control, but for the whole DC, VM1 has established 8
   unfinished TCP connections.  So VM1 has consume more resoureces than
   allowed.

4.3.  Dynamic ACLs

   Assuming all traffic is denied unless the end host is authorized and
   authenticated.  VM1 has been authenticated on source device and a
   dynamic ACL has been generated to allow VM1's traffic to pass.  If
   VM1 migrates to destination device without the dynamic ACL, the
   destination device will drop VM1's traffic, because VM1 is an
   unathenticated end host for it.  So in this case, the dynamic ACL

   needs to migrate with VM.

4.4.  DHCP Snooping

   Assuming source device is DHCP Snooping Enabled and a DHCP Snooping
   mapping item is created for VM1: (IP-VM1: MAC-VM1).  This mapping is
   created dynamically by listening to DHCP Response message.  If VM1
   migrate to destination device, since the IP Address of VM1 doesn't
   change, there is no DHCP Request sent by VM1.  So on destination
   device, there is (IP-VM1: MAC-VM1) mapping, all traffic from VM1 will
   be dropped.  So DHCP Snooping mapping item need to migrate to
   destination device.

4.5.  Multicast Membership

   Multicast membership is similar to DHCP Snooping.  Multicast
   membership is created on ports by listening to IGMP membership report
   messages.  If VM1 migrates to destination, VM1 will not send IGMP
   membership report until next IGMP General Query.  Before that, VM1
   may not be able to recevie Multicast packets since network devices on
   and above destination devices don't knwo VM1's Multicast membership
   and don't forwarding the Multicast packets to VM1.


5.  Existing network management protocol and the limitations

   RFC3535 introduces many Network Management architectures and
   protocols.  Basically, there are two kinds of architectures: network
   element oriented (SNMP and NETCONF) and Policy based (COPS-PR).  In
   this section, we will introduce why these NMPs can not resolve the
   problem described in this draft.

5.1.  Limitations

   We analyze the problem described above into two aspects.  One is
   Policies migration and the other is dynamic information migration.

5.1.1.  For Policies migration

   Existing NMP could be used to migrate Policies from source device to
   destination device.  But we still need to face some questions:

      Is device-oriented NMP suitable for policies migration?

      Is C/S based NMP suitable for DC management?

      How does NM know the source and destination device?

      Do we need an automatic policies migration mechanism?

5.1.2.  For Dynamic Information Migration

   Currently, NMP is not used to configure dynamic information.

   And, as Fig.3 shows, if we fail to begin migrating dynamic
   information at appropriate time (the time during VM not running
   period), the running services will be interrupted.  For example, if
   dynamic information is migrated before 'VM not running period',
   dynamic information is inaccurate and the running services may be
   broken down when new VM restarts.  In order to make accurate
   migration and keep running service uninterrupted, we need to know the
   exact timing for migration.


6.  Security Considerations

   The policies and dynamic information described above are all about
   security.
