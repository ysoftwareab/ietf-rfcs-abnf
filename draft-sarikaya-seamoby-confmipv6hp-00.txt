Abstract

   This document states the conformity of Mobile IPv6 Hierarchical
   Paging (MIPv6HP) protocol I-D to RFC 3154 on Requirements and
   Functional Architecture for an IP Host Alerting Protocol. It is
   stated to which clauses MIPv6HP fully conforms and to which clauses
   close to full conformance is claimed. The clauses of RFC 3154 to
   which MIPv6HP does not conform are claried.

Confirmity Statement of Mobile IPv6 Hierarchical Paging     September 2001


1. Introduction
   RFC 3154 [1] states the requirements and attempts to define a
   functional architecture for an IP Host Alerting Protocol. The authors
   of this I-D have submitted an I-D, The Mobile IPv6 Hierarchical
   Paging protocol (MIPv6HP) [2] which defines an IP host alerting
   protocol. In this draft we discuss the clauses where MIPv6HP conforms
   to [1] and where the conformity can easily be achieved. Also this I-D
   states where the conformity  to [1] was not claimed.



2. Terms

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [3].

   Please see [4] for definition of terms used in describing paging. In
   addition, [2] defined several terms.

3. Where full conformity is claimed

   The clauses on security, in particular clauses in Section 3.1, 3.2
   and 3.3.
   4.1 on power consumption by relying on L2 paging where available the
   need to establish L3 connection is eliminated.
   4.3 on control of Broadcast/Multicast/Anycast. MIPv6HP additionaly
   has provisions to support more dormant mode options.
   4.5 on no mobile routers.
   4.8 on support for mobility protocols. MIPv6HP supports MIPv6. It is
   integrated into MIPv6.
   4.9 on dormant mode termination.
   4.10 on network updates. MIPv6HP efficiently supports the moving of
   the dormant hosts in paging areas. This is clearly explained in
   Section 3.1.1 of [2].
   4.11 on Efficient Utilization of L2. MIPv6HP makes maximum use of L2
   dormant mode support if available.
   4.12 on Orthogonality of Paging Area and Subnets and 4.13 on future
   L3 paging support. MIPv6HP allows both Layer 3 and Layer 2 paging
   areas. It defines protocol operation distinctively under L3 paging
   areas or under L2 paging areas to be used based on availability.
   4.15 on   Reliability of Packet Delivery and 4.16 on  Robustness
   Against Message Loss. MIPv6HP uses IPv6 and ICMPv6 datagrams. Every
   message has a corresponding reply and this is how reliability and
   robustness can be achieved.
   4.18 on  Flexibility of Paging Area Design. MIPv6HP allows maximum
   flexibility on the paging areas. The (L2 or L3) paging areas can even
   be dynamic.
   4.19   Availability of Security Support and 4.24 through 4.27 on
           security. MIPv6HP has the security support as required.
           Section 6 in [2] gives a detailed explanation of the
           security support.

   4.20   Through 4.22 on authentication support. [2] uses IPsec which
           provides the authentication.

4. Where conformity can be easily achieved
   Clause 4.6 on multiple dormant modes.
   4.2 on scalability. The dormant mode hosts state is only kept at PMAP
   which plays the role of DMA in the functional architecture of [1].
   4.14 on   Robustness Against Failure of Network Elements.
   4.17 on   Flexibility of Administration.
   4.23 on   Paging Volume. Presently MIPv6HP handles each paging
   request per host separately. If the volume is high it may help in
   handling several paging requests together. Future revisions of [2]
   will conform to this clause fully.
   Clauses in Section 5 of [1] on functional architecture. PMAP in our
   protocol plays the role of DMA. It captures the packets for hosts in
   dormant mode upon registration. We have opted for colocating TA with
   DMA or PMAP, as is allowed.

5. Where no conformity is claimed
   Clause 4.4 on inactive mode. This mode is not supported.
   Clause 4.7 on the independence of mobility protocol. MIPv6HP is based
   on an extension of Mobile IPv6.
