                                Abstract

   This document describes ECC groups for use as Diffie-Hellman groups 
   in the Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol.  These new 
   groups are defined to align IKEv2 with other standards, particularly 
   NIST standards, and with and to provide more efficient implementation
   than in previously defined groups.

INTERNET-DRAFT            ECC Groups For IKEv2                March 2005 

1.  Introduction

   This document describes default groups for use in elliptic curve
   Diffie-Hellman in IKEv2 in addition to the groups already so defined.

   The IKEv2 document [IKEv2] defines Diffie-Hellman groups 1 and 2 
   from [IKE] for use in IKEv2.  The IKEv2 algorithms document [ALGS] 
   defines group 2 as well as group 14 from [RFC-3526] for IKEv2.  
   (The numbering of the groups is as in [IANA].)  All three of these 
   groups are MODP modular exponentiation groups.  

   This document defines ECP type elliptic curve groups for use in 
   IKEv2.  This is done for four reasons:

   1.  To enable IKEv2 to be implemented in a way that enjoys the 
       computational and bandwidth advantages of elliptic curves over 
       modular exponentiation groups. 

   2.  To align IKEv2 with existing ECC standards, particularly 
       those of NIST.

   3.  To provide a common elliptic curve environment for users of 
       IKE and IKEv2.

   4.  The groups proposed are capable of providing security consistent 
       with the new Advanced Encryption Standard.

   In addition, it is anticipated that the availability of standardized 
   groups will result in optimizations for a particular curve and field 
   size as well as allowing precomputation that could result in faster 
   implementations.

   In summary, due to the performance advantages of elliptic curve 
   groups in IKEv2 implementations and the need for further alignment 
   with other standards, this document defines three elliptic curves for
   IKEv2.

2. ECC Groups

   IKEv2 implementations SHOULD support the following three 
   Diffie-Hellman groups.

     Group Number        Group Type      Bit Length      Defined

     19                  ECP             256            [IKE-ECP]
     20                  ECP             384            [IKE-ECP]
     21                  ECP             521            [IKE-ECP]

INTERNET-DRAFT            ECC Groups For IKEv2                March 2005 

   The details of the three groups are given in [IKE-ECP], in which 
   they are defined for use in the original version of IKE.  The group 
   numbers correspond to the anticipated IANA identifiers.  For a full 
   list of Diffie-Hellman groups, see [IANA] or {ECG5]. 

3. Alignment with Other Standards

   The following table summarizes the appearance of these three elliptic
   curve groups in other standards.

   [ISO-15946-4].

4. Security Considerations

   Since this document proposes new groups for use within IKEv2, many 
   of the security considerations contained within [IKEv2] apply here 
   as well.

   The groups proposed in this document correspond to the symmetric key
   sizes 128 bits, 192 bits, and 256 bits.  This allows the IKE key 
   exchange to offer security comparable with the AES algorithms [AES].

5. IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
