Abstract

   Photuris is a session-key management protocol.  Extensible Exchange-
   Schemes are provided to enable future implementation changes without
   affecting the basic protocol.

   Additional authentication attributes are included for use with the IP
   Authentication Header (AH).

1.  Additional Exchange-Schemes

   The packet format and basic facilities are already defined for Pho-
   turis [RFC-zzzz].

   These optional Exchange-Schemes are specified separately, and no sin-
   gle implementation is expected to support all of them.

   This document defines the following values:

   (3)   Implementation Optional.  Any modulus (p) with a recommended
         generator (g) of 3.  When the Exchange-Scheme Size is non-zero,
         the modulus is contained in the Exchange-Scheme Value field in
         the list of Offered-Schemes.

         An Exchange-Scheme Size of zero is invalid.

         Validity-Method             "MD5-IPMAC Check"                   |

         This combination of features requires a modulus with at least
         64-bits of cryptographic strength.

   (4)   Implementation Optional.  Any modulus (p) with a recommended
         generator (g) of 2.  When the Exchange-Scheme Size is non-zero,
         the modulus is contained in the Exchange-Scheme Value field in
         the list of Offered-Schemes.

         When the Exchange-Scheme Size field is zero, includes by refer-
         ence all of the moduli specified in the list of Offered-Schemes
         for Scheme #2.

         This combination of features requires a modulus with at least
         64-bits of cryptographic strength.

   (5)   Implementation Optional.  Any modulus (p) with a recommended
         generator (g) of 5.  When the Exchange-Scheme Size is non-zero,
         the modulus is contained in the Exchange-Scheme Value field in
         the list of Offered-Schemes.

         An Exchange-Scheme Size of zero is invalid.

         This combination of features requires a modulus with at least
         64-bits of cryptographic strength.

   (7)   Implementation Optional.  Any modulus (p) with a variable gen-
         erator (g).  When the Exchange-Scheme Size is non-zero, the
         pair [g,p] is contained in the Exchange-Scheme Value field in
         the list of Offered-Schemes.  Each is encoded in a separate
         Variable Precision Integer (VPI).  The generator VPI is fol-
         lowed by (concatenated to) the modulus VPI, and the result is
         nested inside the Exchange-Scheme Value field.

         An Exchange-Scheme Size of zero is invalid.

         64-bits of cryptographic strength.

         When more than one modulus is specified for a given kind of
         Scheme, the Size of the modulus MUST be unique, independent of
         the Size of the generator.

   (8)   Implementation Optional.  Any modulus (p) with a recommended
         generator (g) of 2.  When the Exchange-Scheme Size is non-zero,
         the modulus is contained in the Exchange-Scheme Value field in
         the list of Offered-Schemes.

         the Size of the generator.



2.  Additional Key-Generation-Function
2.1.  SHA1 Hash

   SHA1 [FIPS-180-1] is used as a pseudo-random-function for generating
   the key(s).  The key(s) begin with the most significant bits of the
   hash.  SHA1 is iterated as needed to generate the requisite length of
   key material.

   When an individual key does not use all 160-bits of the last hash,
   any remaining unused (least significant) bits of the last hash are
   discarded.  When combined with other uses of key generation for the
   same purpose, the next key will begin with a new hash iteration.


3.  Additional Privacy-Methods
3.1.  DES-CBC over Mask

   As described in [RFC-zzzz] "Privacy-Key Computation", sufficient pri-
   vacy-key material is generated to match the message length, beginning
   with the next field after the SPI, and including the Padding.  The
   message is masked by XOR with the privacy-key.

   Then, the Key-Generation-Function is iterated to generate a DES key.
   The most significant 64-bits (8 bytes) of the generated hash are used
   for the privacy-key, and the remainder are discarded.  Although
   extremely rare, the 64 weak, semi-weak, and possibly weak keys
   [Schneier95, pages 280-282] are discarded.  The Key-Generation-
   Function is iterated until a valid key is obtained.

   The least significant bit of each key byte is ignored (or set to par-
   ity when the implementation requires).

   The 64-bit CBC IV is zero.  Message encryption begins with the next   +
   field after the SPI, and continues to the end of the data indicated
   by the UDP Length.

3.2.  DES-EDE3-CBC over Mask

   This is "Triple DES" outer-CBC EDE encryption (and DED decryption)
   with three 56-bit keys [KR96].

   As described in [RFC-zzzz] "Privacy-Key Computation", sufficient pri-
   vacy-key material is generated to match the message length, beginning
   with the next field after the SPI, and including the Padding.  The
   message is masked by XOR with the privacy-key.

   Then, the Key-Generation-Function is iterated (at least) three times
   to generate the three DES keys.  The most significant 64-bits (8
   bytes) of each generated hash are used for each successive privacy-
   key, and the remainder are discarded.  Each key is examined sequen-
   tially, in the order used for encryption.  A key that is identical to
   a previous key MUST be discarded.  Although extremely rare, the 64
   weak, semi-weak, and possibly weak keys [Schneier95, pages 280-282]
   MUST be discarded.  The Key-Generation-Function is iterated until a
   valid key is obtained before generating the next key.

   In all three keys, the least significant bit of each key byte is
   ignored (or set to parity when the implementation requires).

   The 64-bit CBC IV is zero.  Message encryption begins with the next   +
   field after the SPI, and continues to the end of the data indicated
   by the UDP Length.


4.  Additional Validity-Method
4.1.  SHA1-IPMAC Check

   As described in [RFC-zzzz] "Validity Verification", the Verification
   field value is the SHA1 [FIPS-180-1] hash over the concatenation of

      SHA1( key, keyfill, data, datafill, key, mdfill )                  |

   where the key is the computed verification-key.

   The keyfill and datafill use the same pad-with-length technique       |
   defined for mdfill.  This padding and length is implicit, and does
   not appear in the datagram.

   The resulting Verification field is a 160-bit Variable Precision
   Integer (22 bytes including Size).  When used in calculations, the    +
   Verification data includes both the Size and Value fields.

5.  Additional Attributes

   The attribute format and basic facilities are already defined for
   Photuris [RFC-zzzz].

   These optional attributes are specified separately, and no single
   implementation is expected to support all of them.

   This document defines the following values:

      There is no required format or content for the Identification
      value.  The value may be a number or string of any kind.  See
      [RFC-zzzz] "Use of Identification and Secrets" for details.

      The symmetric secret-key (as specified) is selected based on the
      contents of the Identification field.  All implementations MUST

      support at least 62 bytes.  The selected symmetric secret-key
      SHOULD provide at least 80-bits of cryptographic strength.

      As described in [RFC-zzzz] "Identity Verification", the Verifica-
      tion field value is the SHA1 [FIPS-180-1] hash over the concatena-
      tion of:

         SHA1( key, keyfill, data, datafill, key, mdfill )               |

      where the key is the computed verification-key.

      The keyfill and datafill use the same pad-with-length technique    |
      defined for mdfill.  This padding and length is implicit, and does
      not appear in the datagram.

      The resulting Verification field is a 160-bit Variable Precision
      Integer (22 bytes including Size).  When used in calculations, the +
      Verification data includes both the Size and Value fields.

      For both [RFC-zzzz] "Identity Verification" and "Validity Verifi-
      cation", the verification-key is the SHA1 [FIPS-180-1] hash of the
      following concatenated values:

       + the symmetric secret-key,
       + the computed shared-secret.

      For [RFC-zzzz] "Session-Key Computation", the symmetric secret-key

         The additional datafill protects against the attack described

         is implicit, and does not appear in the datagram.

      Integer.  Valid Identifications and symmetric secret-keys are pre- |
      configured by the parties.                                         |

      There is no required format or content for the Identification      |
      value.  The value may be a number or string of any kind.  See      |
      [RFC-zzzz] "Use of Identification and Secrets" for details.        |

      The symmetric secret-key (as specified) is selected based on the   |
      contents of the Identification field.  All implementations MUST    |

      SHOULD provide at least 80-bits of cryptographic strength.         |

      As described in [RFC-zzzz] "Identity Verification", the Verifica-  |

      The resulting Verification field is a 160-bit Variable Precision   |
      Integer (22 bytes including Size).  When used in calculations, the |
      Verification data includes both the Size and Value fields.         |

      For both [RFC-zzzz] "Identity Verification" and "Validity Verifi-  |

      For [RFC-zzzz] "Session-Key Computation", the symmetric secret-key |

   May be selected as an ESP Attribute-Choice, pursuant to [RFC-1829] et
   sequitur.  The selected Exchange-Scheme SHOULD provide at least
   56-bits of cryptographic strength.

   As described in [RFC-zzzz] "Session-Key Computation", the most sig-
   nificant 64-bits (8 bytes) of the Key-Generation iteration are used
   for the key, and the remainder are discarded.  Although extremely
   rare, the 64 weak, semi-weak, and possibly weak keys [Schneier95,
   pages 280-282] MUST be discarded.  The Key-Generation-Function is
   iterated until a valid key is obtained.

   The least significant bit of each key byte is ignored (or set to par-
   ity when the implementation requires).

   Profile:

      When negotiated with Photuris, the transform differs slightly from
      [RFC-1829].

      The 32-bit Security Parameters Index (SPI) field is followed by a
      32-bit Sequence Number (SN).

      The 64-bit CBC IV is generated from the 32-bit Security Parameters
      Index (SPI) field followed by (concatenated with) the 32-bit
      Sequence Number (SN) field.  Then, the bit-wise complement of the
      32-bit Sequence Number (SN) value is XOR'd with the first 32-bits
      (SPI):

         (SPI ^ -SN) || SN

      The Padding values begin with the value 1, and count up to the
      number of padding bytes.  For example, if the plaintext length is
      41, the padding values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, plus any addi-
      tional obscuring padding.

      The PadLength and PayloadType are not appended.  Instead, the Pay- +
      loadType is indicated by the SPI, as specified by the ESP-         +

      Attributes attribute (#2).

      After decryption, if the padding bytes are not the correct sequen-
      tial values, then the payload is discarded, and a "Decryption
      Failed" error is indicated, as described in [RFC-xxxx].

   encryption choice.  This indicates that the following attribute is    |
   inverted from encryption to decryption (or decryption to encryption)  |
   as the attributes are processed.                                      |

   For example, the combination

   indicates "Triple DES" outer-CBC EDE encryption (and DED decryption)  |
   with three keys [KR96] pursuant to [RFC-1851] et sequitur.  The
   selected Exchange-Scheme SHOULD provide at least 112-bits of crypto-
   graphic strength.

   As described in [RFC-zzzz] "Session-Key Computation", the Key-
   Generation-Function is iterated (at least) three times to generate
   the three independent keys, in the order used for encryption.  The
   most significant 64-bits (8 bytes) of each iteration are used for
   each successive key, and the remainder are discarded.                 +

   Each key is examined sequentially, in the order used for encryption.

A.  Exchange-Scheme Selection                                            -

   At first glance, there appear to be a large number of exchange-       +
   schemes.  In practice, the selection is simple to automate.           +

   Each scheme indicates a needed strength.  This strength is based upon +
   the functions used in protecting the Photuris Exchanges themselves.   +

   Each keyed attribute also indicates a needed strength.  This strength +
   is based upon its cryptographic functions.                            +

   Because the usage of these functions is orthogonal, the same strength +
   value can select an appropriate scheme that meets the needs of both   +
   features.


A.1.  Responder

   The attributes to be offered to the particular Initiator are exam-    +
   ined.  For each level of strength specified, a scheme that meets or   +
   exceeds the requirements is offered.                                  +

   For example, a Responder offering MD5-IPMAC and SHA1-IPMAC might      +
   offer scheme #2 with a 512-bit modulus and a 1024-bit modulus, and    +
   scheme #4 with a zero Size (indicating moduli of #2).


A.2.  Initiator

   The strength indicated by the application for the Security Associa-   +
   tion, together with the party privacy policy of the system operator,  +
   is used to select from the offered schemes.  The strength indicates   +
   the minimal level to be chosen, while the party privacy policy indi-  +
   cates whether to choose the minimal or maximal level of available     +
   protection.                                                           +

   For example, an application might indicate that it desires 80-bits of +
   strength.  In that case, only the 1024-bit modulus would be appropri- +
   ate.  The party privacy policy of the system operator would indicate  +
   whether to choose scheme #2 with "Simple Masking" or scheme #4 with   +
   "DES-CBC over Mask".                                                  +

   Alternatively, an application might indicate that it desires 64-bits  +
   of strength.  The party privacy policy of the system operator would   +
   indicate whether to choose scheme #2 with the 512-bit modulus, or     +
   scheme #4 with the 1024-bit modulus.

Security Considerations                                                  -

   Provision for multiple generators does not enhance the security of    |
   the Photuris protocol exchange itself.  Rather, it provides an oppor- |
   tunity for novelty of moduli, by allowing more forms of moduli to be  |
   used.  An abundance of moduli inhibits a determined attacker from     |
   pre-calculating moduli exchange values, and discourages dedication of |
   resources for analysis of any particular modulus.  That is, this pro- |
   tects the community of Photuris users.                                |

   In addition to preventing various attacks by protecting verification  |
   fields, the masking of the message plaintext before encryption is
   intended to obscure the relation of the number of parties and SPIs
   active between two IP nodes.  The privacy mask dependency on the SPI  |
   and SPILT generates a different initial encrypted block for every SPI
   creation message.

   This obscurement would be less effective when the SPI and SPILT are   |
   invariant or are not created for a particular exchange direction.
   The number of parties could be revealed by the number of exchanges
   with differences in the initial encrypted blocks.


Acknowledgements

   Phil Karn was principally responsible for the design of party privacy
   protection, and provided much of the design rationale text (now
   removed to a separate document).

   William Simpson designed the packet formats, and additional Exchange-
   Schemes, editing and formatting.  All such mistakes are his responsi-
   bity.

   Use of encryption for privacy protection is also found in the Sta-
   tion-To-Station authentication protocol [DOW92].

   Bart Preneel and Paul C van Oorschot in [PO96] suggested adding
   padding between the data and trailing key when hashing for authenti-
   cation.

   Niels Provos developed the first implementation with multiple schemes
   and multiple moduli per scheme (circa July 1997).
