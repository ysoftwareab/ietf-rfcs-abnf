Internet-Draft              LoST Sub-Services                  July 2008


1.  Introduction

   The Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol [LOST] maps
   service identifiers (URNs) and civic or geospatial information to
   service URIs based on service regions.  This extension allows a LoST
   client to find the instances of the services and it's sub services,
   by asking a LoST server for the list of sub services that it
   supports.  Even the deaf & dumb people or foreigner can make use of
   the advantages of this draft to contact the sub service of the
   instances of service, in which the LoST client is interested.

   It provides an indication of which service and sub services the
   server can look up.  The sub services are the capabilities of the
   given service.  For example the sub service list of a PSAP can be
   urn:service:sos.police.terrorist, urn:service:sos.police.arson,
   urn:service:sos.police.robbery.  This means that the given PSAP is
   able to handle terrorist attack, robbery, and a wild fire.  So the
   clients come to know in advance whether a required sub service is
   offered for a particular area.

   This document describes how to get sub service list of the instance
   of service, it can be accomplished by specifying additional
   information in the query using the extension named, 'sub-service'.
   Which will return all the sub services of requested service.


2.  Terminology used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  LoST extension

   A LoST client can ask a LoST server for the list of sub services it
   knows about for a particular services in the given area.  And he can
   find the sub-service information from the <findServiceResponse>.  The
   LoST client will be interested in any one of them or combination of
   listed subservices.  It will help a LoST client to locate the
   instances of services, those match more closely to his interest.  It
   avoids the clients to query the service URIs returned to obtain
   additional information about the services, thus reducing the number
   of queries to be done to get the accurate search for the instances of
   service.

   In the current scenario, the client doesn't know what kind of
   subservices the returned service uri supports, so he can't contact

   the service uri with additional information(i.e. sub services or
   service options the client wants) to get a better and timely service.

   We Introduce a new attribute and element to achieve this task.
   'getsubservice' for the <findService> element and <subserviceList>
   for the <findServiceResponse> element.


4.  sub-service

   Suppose a LoST client is seeking help from the police to get
   protection from a thief.  Currently, the Location-to-Service
   Translation (LoST) protocol only supports mapping of the locations of
   police stations.  There are no options to know any particular
   information about the capabilities of the instance of the service.
   Using the sub-service information, the LoST client can get the
   details of a specific police station, which can handle a thief or
   arson etc.


5.  sub-service in Request


   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <findService xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:lost1"
        recursive="true" serviceBoundary="value" getSubservice="true">
        <location id="627b8bf819d0bad4d" profile="civic">
          <civicAddress
            xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10:civicAddr">

           <service>urn:service:sos.police</service>
      </findService>

           Figure 1: A <findService> query with
                   the new <getSubservice> attribute.



   Here the LoST client is searching for police stations in the given
   area and finds it's capabilities.

                       with the new <subserviceList> attribute.


   The response of the previous query contains the details of the PSAP
   in the specified service region and it's sub-service list.  This
   indicates that, the given instance of requested service is capable of
   handling terrorist, theft and arson.  And it tells a mobile device

   what kind of sub services are available close by that location.  The
   LoST client can contact the service uri with additional information
   (i.e. sub services or service options the client wants) so that he
   will get a better and timely service from the requested uri.


7.  Security Considerations

   The same security considerations as in [LOST] apply.


8.  IANA Considerations

   TBD
