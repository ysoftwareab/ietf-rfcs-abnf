1.  Introduction

1.1.  Objective

   This document explores the scope, use-cases and requirements for a
   BGP based routing solution to establish end-to-end intent-aware paths
   across a multi-domain service provider network environment.

   The targeted design outcome is to define the technology and protocol
   extensions that may be required in a manner that addresses the widest
   application.

   The problem that the document initially focuses on is the BGP-based
   delivery of an intent across several transport domains.  To do this,
   it describes existing intent-aware routing solutions that are
   deployed and then extends the solution scope and architecture to BGP.

   The problem space is then widened to include any intent (including
   NFV chains and their location), any dataplane and the application of
   the intent-based routing to the Service/VPN routes.  All of this is
   detailed in the rest of the document.

1.2.  Color-Aware Routing

   Color-Aware Routing (CAR) establishes routed paths that satisfy
   specific intent in a network.  This section describes the basic
   concepts that define CAR and the protocols that currently support it.

   The figure below is used as reference.

              Figure 1: Color-aware routing reference topology

1.2.1.  Intent

   Intent in routing may be any combination of the following behaviors:

   *  Topology path selection (e.g. minimize metric, avoid resource)

   *  NFV service insertion (e.g. service chain steering)

   *  Per-hop behavior (e.g.  QoS for 5G slice)

   An intent-aware routed path may be within a single network domain or
   across multiple domains.

1.2.2.  Color

   Color is a 32-bit numerical value that is associated with an intent,
   as defined in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy]

1.2.3.  Colored Service Route

   An Egress PE E2 colors a BGP service (e.g., VPN) route V/v to
   indicate the particular intent that E2 requests for the traffic bound
   to V/v.  The color (C) is encoded as a BGP Color Extended community
   [I-D.ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps].

1.2.4.  Color-Aware Route

   (E2, C) is a color-aware route to E2 which satisfies the intent
   associated with color C.

   Multiple technologies already provide color-aware paths in solutions
   that are widely deployed.

   *  SR Policy [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy]

   *  IGP Flex-Algo [I-D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo]

   In the context of large-scale SR-MPLS networks, SR Policy is
   applicable to both intra-domain and inter-domain deployments; whereas
   IGP Flex-Algo is better suited to intra-domain scenarios.

1.2.5.  Service Route Automated Steering on color-aware route

   An ingress PE E1 automatically steers V-destined packets onto a
   Color-Aware path bound to (E2, C).  If several such paths exist, a
   preference scheme is used to select the best path: E.g.  IGP Flex-
   Algo first, then SR Policy.

1.2.6.  Inter-Domain color-aware routing with SR Policy

   If E1 and E2 are in different domains, E1 may request an SR-PCE in
   its domain for a path to (E2, C).  The SR-PCE (or a set of them)
   computes the end-to-end path and installs it at E1 as an SR Policy.
   The end-to-end color-aware path may seamlessly cross multiple
   domains.

1.2.7.  Need for a BGP-based color-aware routing solution

   *  An operator with an existing Seamless-MPLS/BGP-LU inter-domain
      deployment [I-D.ietf-mpls-seamless-mpls] may prefer a BGP based
      extension as a more incremental approach

   *  There may be an expectation that BGP would support a larger scale

   *  Trust boundaries in an inter-domain deployment leads to a
      preference for a BGP peering based solution

1.2.8.  BGP Color-Aware Routing

   BGP Color-Aware Routing (CAR) is a new BGP solution which signals
   intent-aware routes to reach a given destination (e.g., E2).  (E2, C)
   represents a BGP hop-by-hop distributed route that builds an inter-
   domain color-aware path to E2 for color C.

1.2.9.  Architectural consistency among color-aware routing solutions

   As seen above, multiple technologies exist that provide color-aware
   routing in a network.  A BGP based solution must be compliant with
   the existing principles that apply to them:

   *  Service routes MUST be colored using BGP Color Extended-Community
      to request intent

      -  V/v via E, colored with C

   *  Colored service routes MUST be automatically steered on an
      appropriate color-aware path

      -  V/v via E with C is steered via (E, C)

      -  (E, C) provided by any color-aware technology or protocol

   *  Color-aware routes MAY resolve recursively via other color-aware
      routes

      -  (E, C) via N recursively resolves via (N, C)

   Here is a brief example that illustrates these principles.

     |----+          +----+              +----+          +----| W/w with C2

     +----------------+  +----------------+  +--- ------------+


    Figure 2: Color-aware routing inter-domain reference topology

   In the figure above, all the nodes are part of an inter-domain
   network under a single authority and with a consistent color-to-
   intent mapping:

   *  Color C1 is mapped to "low delay"

      -  Flex-Algo FA1 is mapped to "low delay" and hence to C1

   *  Color C2 is mapped to "low delay and avoid resource R"

      -  Flex-Algo FA2 is mapped to "low delay and avoid resource R" and
         hence to C2

   E1 receives two BGP colored service routes from E2:

   *  V/v with BGP Color Extended community C1

   *  W/w with BGP Color Extended community C2

   E1 has the following inter-domain color-aware paths:

   *  (E2, C1) provided by BGP CAR which recursively resolves via intra-
      domain color-aware paths:

      -  (N1, C1) provided by IGP FA1 in Domain1

Internet-Draft          BGP CAR Problem Statement          November 2021


      -  (N2, C1) provided by SR Policy bound to color C1 in Domain2

   *  (E2, C2) provided by SR Policy

   E1 automatically steers the received colored service routes as
   follows:

   *  V/v via (E2, C1) provided by BGP CAR

   *  W/w via (E2, C2) provided by SR Policy

   The example illustrates the benefits provided by leveraging the
   architectural principles:

   *  Seamless co-existence of multiple color-aware technologies, e.g.,
      BGP CAR and SR Policy

      -  V/v is steered on BGP CAR color-aware path

      -  W/w is steered on SR Policy color-aware path

   *  Seamless and complementary interworking between different color-
      aware technologies

      -  V/v is steered on a BGP CAR color-aware path that is itself
         resolved within domain 2 onto an SR Policy bound to the color
         of V/v

1.2.10.  Color Domains

   *  A color domain represents a collection of one or more network
      (IGP/BGP) domains with a single, consistent color-to-intent
      mapping

   *  Color re-mapping may happen at color domain boundaries

1.2.11.  Per-Destination and Per-Flow Steering with BGP CAR

   Ingress PE E1 steers packets destined for a service (VPN) route V/v
   via BGP Color-Aware Route R/r to E2

   *  Per-Destination Steering: Incoming packets on E1 match BGP service
      route V/v to be steered based on the destination IP address of the
      packets.

   *  Per-Flow Steering: Incoming packets on E1 match BGP service route
      V/v to be steered based on the combination of the destination IP
      address and additional elements in the packet header (i.e., IP

      flow).  Such a packet lookup may recurse on a forwarding array
      where some of the entries are BGP color-aware routes to E2.  A
      given flow is mapped to a specific entry in this array i.e. via a
      specific BGP color-aware route to E2.

2.  Intent bound to a Color

   The BGP CAR solution must support the following intents bound to a
   color:

   *  Minimization of a cost metric vs a latency metric

      -  Minimization of different metric types, static and dynamic

   *  Exclusion/Inclusion of SRLG and/or Link Affinity and/or minimum
      MTU/number of hops

   *  Bandwidth management

   *  In the inter-domain context, exclusion/inclusion of entire
      domains, and border routers

   *  Inclusion of one or several virtual network function chains

      -  Located in a regional domain and/or core domain, in a DC

   *  Localization of the virtual network function chains

      -  Some functions may be desired in the regional DC or vice versa

   *  Per-Destination and Per-Flow steering

3.  BGP CAR Use-cases

   The BGP CAR route may be a transport route or a service route (in
   this document, we use the term VPN instead of service for
   simplicity).

3.1.  BGP Transport CAR

*  Transport Intent

   -  Intent-aware routing between PEs connected across multiple
      transit domains

      o  Set up BGP based end-to-end paths stitching intent-aware
         intra-domain segments

            Figure 3: Transport CAR Reference Topology

   The following network design assumptions apply to the reference
   topology above, as an example:

   -  Independent ISIS/OSPF SR instance in each domain.

   -  eBGP peering link between ASBRs (121-211, 121-212, 122-211,
      122-212, 231-321, 231-322, 232-321 and 232-322).

   -  Peering links have equal cost metric.

   -  Peering links have delay configured or measured as shown by
      "D".  D=50 for cross peering links.

   -  VPN service is running from PE31 to PE11 via service RRs (S-RRn
      in figure).

*  The following sections illustrate a few examples of intent use-
   cases applicable to transport routes.

3.1.1.  Use-case of minimization of a cost metric vs a latency metric

   *  In the reference topology of Figure 3

         Each domain has Algo 0 and Flex Algo 128

         Algo 0 is for minimum cost metric(cost optimized).

         Flex Algo 128 definition is for minimum delay (low latency).

   *  Cost Optimized

      -  Color C1 - Minimum cost intent.  (Here, a BGP CAR route with
         Color C1 is being used, instead of BGP-LU.)

      -  On PE11, VPN routes colored with C1 are steered via (C1, PE31)
         BGP CAR route

         o  BGP CAR for C1 sets up path(s) between PEs for end-to-end
            minimum cost.

         o  (2) These paths traverse over intra-domain Algo 0 in each
            domain and account for the peering link cost between ASBRs.

         o  Example: PE11 learns (C1, PE31) CAR route via several equal
            paths:

            1.  One such path is through FA0 to node 121, links 121-211,
                FA0 to 231, link 231-321, FA0 to PE31

            2.  Another such path is through FA0 to node 122, link
                122-212, FA0 to 232, link 232-322, FA0 to PE31.

   *  Minimize latency

      -  Color C2 - Minimum latency intent.

      -  On PE11, VPN routes colored with C2 are steered via (C2, PE31)
         BGP CAR route.

         o  BGP CAR for C2 advertises paths between PEs for minimum end-
            to-end delay.

         o  (2) These paths traverse over intra-domain Flex Algo 128 in
            each domain and account for peering link delay between
            ASBRs.

         o  (3) Example: PE11 learns (C2, PE31) BGP CAR route and best
            path is through FA128 to node 122, link 122-212, FA128 to
            232, link 232-322, FA128 to PE31.

3.1.2.  Use-case of exclusion/inclusion of link affinity

   *  Color C3 - Intent to Minimize cost metric and avoid purple links

   *  In the reference topology of Figure 3

         Each domain has Flex Algo 129 and some links have purple
         affinity.

         Flex Algo 129 definition is set to minimum cost metric and
         avoid purple links (within domain).

         Peering cross links are colored purple by policy.

   *  On PE11, VPN routes colored with C3 are steered via (C3, PE31) BGP
      CAR route.

      -  BGP CAR for C3 sets up paths between PEs for minimum end-to-end
         cost and avoiding purple link affinity.

      -  These paths traverse over intra domain Flex Algo 129 in each
         domain and accounts for peering link cost between ASBR and
         avoiding purple links.

      -  Example: PE11 learns (C3, PE31) BGP CAR route via 2 paths.

         1.  First path is through FA 129 to node 121, link 121-211,
             FA129 to 231, link 231-321, FA129 to PE31.

         2.  Second path is through FA129 to node 122, link 122-212,
             FA129 to 232, link 232-322, FA129 to PE31.

3.2.1.  Use-case of minimization of a cost metric vs a latency metric

   *  In the reference topology of Figure 6

         Each AS has Flex Algo 0 and 128.

         Flex Algo 0 is for minimum cost metric(cost optimized).

         Flex Algo 128 definition is for minimum delay (low latency).

   *  Cost Optimized

      -  Color C1 - Minimum cost intent.

      -  On CE1, flows requiring cost optimized paths to V/24 are
         steered over (C1, V/24) route.

         o  BGP CAR for C1 sets up paths between CEs for minimum end-to-
            end cost.

         o  This advertisement needs BGP CAR between PE-CE for V/24
            prefix and color C1 awareness.

         o  It also needs BGP VPN CAR between PEs and ASBRs for RD:V/24
            prefix and color C1 awareness (C1, RD:V/24).

         o  Paths traverse over PE-CE links, intra-domain Flex Algo 0 in
            each AS and peering links between ASBRs, minimizing cost for
            VPN.

         o  Example: CE1 learns (C1, V/24) CAR route through several
            equal cost paths:

            1.  One path is through link CE1-PE11, FA0 to 121, link
                121-211, FA0 to PE21 and link PE21-CE2.

            2.  Another such path is through CE1-PE12, FA0 to node 122,
                link 122-212, FA0 to PE22, link PE22-CE2.

   *  Minimize latency

      -  Color C2 - Minimum latency intent

      -  On CE1, flows requiring low latency paths to prefix V/24 are
         steered over (C2, V/24) CAR route.

         o  BGP CAR for C2 sets up paths between CEs for minimum end-to-
            end delay.

         o  This advertisement needs BGP CAR between PE-CE for V/24
            prefix and color C2 awareness.

         o  It also needs BGP VPN CAR between PEs and ASBR for RD:V/24
            prefix and color C2 awareness (C2, RD:V/24).

         o  Paths traverse over intra-domain Flex Algo 128 in each AS
            and accounts for inter ASBR link delays and PE-CE link
            delays for the VPN.

         o  Example: CE1 learns (C2, V/24) CAR best route through link
            CE1-PE12, FA128 to 122, link 122-212, FA128 to PE22 and link
            PE22-CE2.

3.2.2.  Use-case of exclusion/inclusion of link affinity

   *  Color C3 - Intent to Minimize cost metric and avoid purple links

   *  In the reference topology of Figure 6

         Each AS has Flex Algo 129 and some links have purple affinity.

         Flex Algo 129 definition is set to minimum cost metric and
         avoid purple links (within AS).

         ASBR cross links are colored purple by policy.  Bottom PE-CE
         links are colored purple as well by policy

   *  On CE1, flows requiring minimum cost path avoiding purple links to
      V/24 are steered over (C3, V/24) BGP CAR route.

      -  BGP CAR for C3 setup paths between CEs for minimum end-to-end
         cost and avoiding purple link affinity.

      -  This advertisement needs BGP CAR between PE-CE for V/24 prefix
         and color C3 awareness

      -  It also needs BGP VPN CAR between PEs and ASBRs for RD:V/24
         prefix and color C3 awareness (C3, RD:V/24).

      -  The path avoids purple PE-CE links, traverses over intra-domain
         Flex Algo 129 in each AS and avoids purple links between VPN
         ASBRs.

      -  Example: CE1 learns (C3, V/24) CAR route through link CE1-PE11,
         FA129 to 121, link 121-211, FA129 to PE21 and link PE21-CE2.

4.  Deployment Requirements

   The figure below shows a reference large-scale multi-domain network
   topology for targeted deployments.  E1 and E2 are PEs; the other
   nodes are border routers between domains in different tiers of the
   network.  A VPN route is advertised via service RRs (S-RR) between an
   egress PE (E2) and an ingress PE (E1).  BGP must provide reachability
   from E1 to E2 based on various intent.

   The solution must support the following :

   *  Co-existence, compatibility and interworking with currently
      deployed SR-PCE based multi-domain color-aware solution

   *  Support different multi-domain deployment designs

      -  Multiple IGP domains within a single AS (Seamless MPLS)

Internet-Draft          BGP CAR Problem Statement          November 2021


         o  Inter-connect at node level (ABR)

      -  Multiple BGP AS domains

         o  Inter-connect via peering links (ASBR)

   *  Support end-to-end path crossing transport domains with different
      technologies and encapsulations

      -  LDP-MPLS

      -  RSVP-TE-MPLS

      -  SR-MPLS

      -  SRv6

      -  IPv4/IPv6

   *  Support interworking between domains with different encapsulations
      (e.g, SR-MPLS and SRv6)

   *  Support multiple transport encapsulations within a domain for co-
      existence and migration

   *  Provide a BGP-based control-plane solution for the use-case
      illustrated in [RFC8604] together with deployment design
      guidelines for the leverage of anycast and binding SIDs.

5.  Scalability

5.1.  Scale Requirements

   *  Support for massive scaled transport network

      -  Number of Remote PE's: >= 300k

      -  Number of Colors C: >= 5

   *  Scalable MPLS dataplane solution

      -  With one label per (C, Remote PE), the 1M MPLS dataplane does
         not work.

      -  A notion of hierarchy or segment list is required.

Internet-Draft          BGP CAR Problem Statement          November 2021


         o  E.g. the SR-PCE builds the end-to-end path as a list of
            segments such that no single node needs to support a data-
            plane scaling in the order of (Remote PE * C)

         o  The solution is thus not a direct extension of BGP-LU

      -  Additionally, PE and transit nodes (ABRs) may be devices with
         limited forwarding table space

      -  Devices may have constraints on packet processing (e.g., label
         operations, number of labels pushed) and performance

   *  Ability to abstract the topology from remote domains - for scale,
      stability and faster convergence

      -  Abstracting PE and/or ABR related state and network events

   *  Support for an Emulated-PULL model for the BGP signaling

      -  The SR-PCE solution natively supports a PULL model: when PE1
         installs a VPN route V/v via (C, PE2), PE1 requests its serving
         SR-PCE to compute the SR Policy to (C, PE2).  I.e.  PE1 does
         not learn unneeded SR policies.

      -  BGP Signaling is natively a PUSH model.

      -  Emulated-PULL refers to the ability for a BGP CAR node PE1 to
         "subscribe" to (C, PE2) route such that only the related paths
         are signaled to PE1.

      -  The subscription and related filtering solution must apply to
         any BGP CAR node

         o  Transport CAR routes

            1.  Ability for a node (PE/ABR/RR) to signal interest for
                routes of specific colors.

            2.  PEs only learn routes that they need - remote VPN
                endpoints (PEs/ASBRs) or transit nodes (ABRs, ASBRs).

            3.  ABRs also only learn and propagate routes they need
                locally in domain

         o  Service/VPN CAR routes

            1.  Ability for a node (PE) to signal interest for a
                specific (Egress PE, Color) transport route

Internet-Draft          BGP CAR Problem Statement          November 2021


            2.  CEs learn routes that they need - interested colors

            3.  PEs learn routes that they need - interested VPNs,
                colors

         o  Automation of the subscription/filter route

            1.  Similar to the SR-PCE solution, when an ingress PE1
                installs VPN V/v via (C, PE2), PE1 originates its
                subscription/filter route for (C, PE2).

         o  Efficient propagation and processing of subscription/filter
            routes.

         o  Ability to perform aggregation and suppression of
            subscription/filter routes at nodes in the route propagation
            path to reduce explosion and churn in propagation of the
            filter routes themselves.

         o  The solution may be optional for networks that do not have
            the large scaling requirements

5.2.  Scale Analysis

   It is useful to analyze the multiple scaling requirements and
   specifically the data plane constraints in the context of a few
   common reference designs and use-cases.

   A couple of example scenarios are listed below for reference.

6.  Network Availability

   *  The BGP CAR solution should provide high network availability for
      typical deployment topologies, with minimum loss of connectivity
      in different network failure scenarios.

   *  The network failure scenarios, applicable technologies and design
      options described in [I-D.ietf-mpls-seamless-mpls] should be used
      as a reference.

   *  In the Seamless-MPLS reference topology in previous section:

      -  Failure of intra-domain links should limit loss of connectivity
         (LoC) to < 50ms.  E.g., PE11 to a P node (not shown), 121 to a
         P node in Domain1 or Domain2)

      -  Failure of an intra-domain node (P node in any domain) should
         limit LoC to < 50ms

      -  Failure of an ABR node (e.g., 121, 231) should limit LoC to <
         1sec

         1sec

      -  Failure of a remote PE node (e.g., PE3) should limit LoC to <
         1sec

      -  Failure of an external link (e.g., 121-211) should limit LoC to
         < 1sec

   *  The solution should explore and describe additional techniques and
      design options that are applicable to further improve handling of
      the failure cases listed above.

7.  BGP Protocol Requirements

   *  Support signaling and distribution of different Color-Aware routes
      to reach a participating node, e.g., a PE.  Intent should be
      indicated by the notion of a Color as defined in SR Policy
      Architecture.

      -  Signal different instances of a prefix distinguished by color

      -  Signal intent associated with a given route

   *  Support for a flexible NLRI definition to accommodate both
      efficiency of processing (e.g., packing) and future extensibility

      -  Avoid limitations associated with existing SAFI NLRI
         definitions.  For example, 24-bit label.

   *  Support for validation of paths

      -  Reachability of next-hop in control plane

      -  Availability and programming of encapsulation in data plane

Internet-Draft          BGP CAR Problem Statement          November 2021


      -  Validation of intent

   *  Next-hop resolution for Color-Aware route

      -  Flexibility to use different intra-domain and inter-domain
         mechanisms - IGP-FA, SR-TE, RSVP-TE, IGP, BGP-LU etc.

      -  Recursive resolution over BGP Color-Aware routes

      -  Ability to carry end-to-end cumulative metric for a given color

      -  Support setting up an end-to-end Color-Aware path using a
         different/less preferred or best-effort paths in domains where
         a particular intent is not available

   *  Separation of transport and VPN service semantics.

      -  Allow for different route distribution planes for service vs
         transport routes.

   *  Support signaling of different transport encapsulations

   *  Support for signaling multiple encapsulations for co-existence and
      migration

   *  Generation of BGP Color-Aware routes sourced from IGP-FA, SR-TE
      policies and BGP-LU from a domain

   *  Support signaling across domains with different color mappings for
      a given intent.

8.  Future Considerations

   Multicast service intent
