                   P-Access-Network-Info ABNF Update
                  draft-holmberg-dispatch-pani-abnf-03

Abstract

   This document updates RFC 7315, by modifying the extension-access-
   info part of the P-Access-Network-Info header field Augmented Backus-
   Naur Form (ABNF), and by adding the following 'access-info' header
   field parameter values to the list of 'access-info' header field
   parameter values in the ABNF: 'operator-specific-GI' and 'utran-sai-
   3gpp'.  The values are defined in the ABNF, but are not included in
   the list.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7315] defines the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] P-
   Access-Network-Info header field.

   The header field syntax contains an 'access-info' header field
   parameter, with a set of pre-defined values.  Most pre-defined values
   follow the 'generic-param' rule [RFC3261].  However, currently the
   Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] in [RFC7315] requires new
   values to follow the 'gen-value' rule [RFC3261], which is more
   restrictive than 'generic-param'.  There is no justification for the
   restriction, and new values have already been defined following the
   'generic-param' rule.

   The ABNF also defines the following 'access-info' header field
   parameter values: 'operator-specific-GI' and 'utran-sai-3gpp'.
   However, the values are not included in the list of 'access-info'
   values.

   This document updates section 5.4 of [RFC7315], by modifying the
   extension-access-info part of the P-Access-Network-Info header field
   ABNF.

   As the P-Access-Network-Info header field is mainly used in networks
   defined by the 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), where new
   values following the 'generic-param' rule have been defined
   [TS.3GPP.24.229], the update is not seen to cause backward
   compatibility concerns.

2.  Update to RFC 7315

   This section updates the ABNF defined in section 5.4 of RFC 7315, as
   described below:


  Old syntax:

      access-info            = cgi-3gpp / utran-cell-id-3gpp /
                               dsl-location / i-wlan-node-id /
                               ci-3gpp2 / eth-location /
                               ci-3gpp2-femto / fiber-location /
                               np / gstn-location /local-time-zone /
                               dvb-rcs2-node-id / extension-access-info
      np                     = "network-provided"
      extension-access-info  = gen-value


  New syntax:

      access-info            = cgi-3gpp / utran-cell-id-3gpp /
                               dsl-location / i-wlan-node-id /
                               ci-3gpp2 / eth-location /
                               ci-3gpp2-femto / fiber-location /
                               np / gstn-location /local-time-zone /
                               dvb-rcs2-node-id / operator-specific-GI /
                               utran-sai-3gpp / extension-access-info
      np                     = "network-provided"
      extension-access-info  = generic-param


3.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the P-Access-Network-Info header
   field are defined in [RFC7315].  The ABNF update defined in this
   document does not impact the security considerations.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requests from IANA.
