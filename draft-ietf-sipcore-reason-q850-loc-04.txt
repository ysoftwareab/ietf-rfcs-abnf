     ISUP Cause Location Parameter for the SIP Reason Header Field
               draft-ietf-sipcore-reason-q850-loc-04.txt

Abstract

   The SIP Reason header field is defined for carrying ISDN User Part
   (ISUP) cause values as well as SIP response codes.  Some services in
   SIP networks may need to know the ISUP location where the call was
   released in the PSTN network to correctly interpret the reason of
   release.

1.  Introduction

   The SIP Reason header field specification [RFC3326] describes a SIP
   header field that is used to indicate that a SIP request is carrying
   the reason of release.  It may be an SIP response or ISUP release
   cause as specified within [Q.850].  [RFC3326] does specify that a
   ISUP [Q.850] cause code can be carried within a SIP response.  The
   [Q.850] location information identifies the part of the ISUP network
   where the call was released.

   This document adds a location value parameter to the reason-extension
   parameter in [RFC3326] so that the [Q.850] location value can be
   interworked from the PSTN.  The interworking from PTSN needs only to
   include the location received by the interworking gateway.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Rationale

   The primary intent of the parameter defined in this specification is
   for use in IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) networks defined by 3GPP but
   also open to be used by any other network.  The purpose of this
   parameter is to transport the location of call release from the
   originating PSTN entity to the SIP entity receiving the response or

Internet-Draft       ISUP Release Location Parameter         August 2018


   BYE message containing the location of the call release.  The ISDN
   location is defined in [Q.850].

4.  Mechanism

   As defined by [RFC3326] a Reason header field MAY appear in any
   request in a dialog, in any CANCEL request and in any response whose
   status code explicitly allows the presence of this header field.  The
   syntax of the header field follows the standard SIP parameter syntax.

   The mechanism employed adds a parameter with the ISUP location value
   defined in [Q.850] to the Reason header field that identifies the
   [Q.850] location of the call release in ISUP as defined in [Q.850] .
   The location is a 4 bit value which reflects the possible locations
   where an ISUP call is released.  Some values are spare or reserved
   for national use.  The Augmented BNF (ABNF) [RFC5234] for this
   parameter is shown in Figure 1.

   reason-extension =/ isup-cause-location
   isup-cause-location =  "location" EQUAL string

   The following values shall be used as location:
   U       for 0 0 0 0 user
   LPN     for 0 0 0 1 private network serving the local user
   LN      for 0 0 1 0 public network serving the local user
   TN      for 0 0 1 1 transit network
   RLN     for 0 1 0 0 public network serving the remote user
   RPN     for 0 1 0 1 private network serving the remote user
   LOC-6   for 0 1 1 0 spare
   INTL    for 0 1 1 1 international network
   LOC-8   for 1 0 0 0 spare
   LOC-9   for 1 0 0 1 spare
   BI      for 1 0 1 0 network beyond interworking point
   LOC-11  for 1 0 1 1 spare
   LOC-12  for 1 1 0 0 reserved for national use
   LOC-13  for 1 1 0 1 reserved for national use
   LOC-14  for 1 1 1 0 reserved for national use
   LOC-15  for 1 1 1 1 reserved for national use

                       Figure 1: isup-cause-location

   Note: These are the values defined within [Q.850] as location.  Thus
   other values are not within the scope of this document.

   Depending on the direction the UAC or UAS shall include the location
   parameter when setting up the Reason header field with a [Q.850]
   cause.  This approach is only valid in cases when the ISUP [Q.850]
   location is available.

   The use of the location parameter is restricted to Q850 cause values
   in other cases the location, if present, MUST be silently ignored.

5.  Example

   The following example shows a SIP 404 response message containing a
   Reason header field with a [Q.850] cause value and a isup-cause-
   location value.  The 404 Response will be set up when a gateway
   receives an ISUP Release with a [Q.850] cause set to 1 meaning
   "Unallocated (unassigned) number", i.e. the number is not known in
   the PSTN.


         SIP/2.0 404 Not Found

         From: Alice <sips:alice@atlanta.example.com>;tag=1234567
         To: Bob <sips:bob@biloxi.example.com>;tag=765432
         Call-ID: 12345600@atlanta.example.com
         CSeq: 1 INVITE
         Reason: Q.850;cause=1;text="Unallocated (unassigned) number";
              location=LN
         Content-Length: 0

6.  Privacy Considerations

   This document doesn't change any of the privacy considerations
   described in [RFC3326].  While the addition of the location parameter
   does provide an indicator of the entity that added the location in
   the signaling path this provides little more exposure than the
   [Q.850] cause itself.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document doesn't change any of the security considerations
   described in [RFC3326].  The addition of the location parameter does
   provide an indicator of the [Q.850] location where the call was
   released within the PSTN.  This information may be used for specific
   location driven services but does not create any additional security
   constrains.  But since the [Q.850] location is very imprecise the
   [Q.850] location value itself will not add any major security
   constraint.  The use of this parameter is not restricted to a
   specific architecture.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  Registration of location Parameter for Reason header field

   This document calls for IANA to register a new SIP header parameter
   as per the guidelines in [RFC3968], which will be added to Header
   Field Parameters sub-registry under http://www.iana.org/assignments/
   sip-parameters.

   Header Field:  Reason

   Parameter Name:  location
