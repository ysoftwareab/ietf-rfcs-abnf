                     Identity Header Error Handling
           draft-ietf-stir-identity-header-errors-handling-00

Abstract

   This document extends STIR and the Authenticated Identity Management
   in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) error handling procedures to
   include the mapping of verification failure reasons to STIR defined
   4xx codes so the failure reason of an Identity header field can be
   conveyed to the upstream authentication service when local policy
   dictates that the call should continue in the presence of a
   verification failure.  This document also defines procedures that
   enable enable a failure reason to be mapped to a specific Identity
   header for scenarios that use multiple Identity header fields where
   some may have errors and others may not and the handling of those
   situations is defined.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8224] in Section 6.2.2 discusses future specifications for
   enhancement of how errors are communicated and the handling of
   multiple Identity header fields.  This specification provides some
   additional mechanisms for solutions to address these problems.

   In some deployments of STIR and specifically using SIP [RFC3261] as
   defined by [RFC8224], one issue with the current error handling,
   specifically with the use of the defined 4xx error responses, is that
   when an error occurs with the verification of the Identity header
   field or the PASSporT contained in the Identity header field and a
   4xx response is returned, the call is then terminated.  It may be the
   case that the policy for handling errors dictates that calls should
   continue even if there is a verification error, in the case of, for
   example inadvertent errors, however the authentication service should
   still be notified of the error so that corrective action can be
   taken.  This specification will discuss the use of the Reason header
   field in subsequent provisional (1xx) responses in order to
   accomplish this.

   For the handling of multiple Identity header fields and the potential
   situation that some of the Identity header fields in a call may pass
   verification but others may have errors, this document provides a

   mechanism to add an identifier so that the authentication service can
   identify which Identity header field is being referred to in the case
   of an error.

2.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Reason header field protocol "STIR"

   This specification defines a new Reason header field [RFC3326]
   protocol "STIR" for STIR applications using SIP as defined in
   [RFC8224].  This will differentiate current protocols, specifically
   "SIP" which is currently in wide industry usage, from the [RFC8224]
   defined error cause codes and the potential use of multiple Reason
   header fields defined in [RFC3326] and updated in [upcoming document
   TBD] allowing multiple Reason header fields with the same "STIR"
   protocol string.  The use of multiple Reason header field is
   discussed in more detail later in the document.

4.  Use of provisional error responses to signal errors without
    terminating the call

   In cases where local policy dictates that a call should continue
   regardless of any verification errors that may have occured,
   including 4XX errors described in [RFC8224] Section 6.2.2, then the
   verification service SHOULD NOT send the 4XX as a response, but
   rather include the error response code and reason phrase in a Reason
   header field, defined in [RFC3326], in the next provisional or final
   responses sent to the authentication service.

   Example Reason header field:

   Reason: STIR ;cause=436 ;text="Bad Identity Info"

5.  Handling of a verification error when there are multiple Identity
    header fields

   In cases where a SIP message includes multiple Identity header fields
   and one of those Identity header fields has an error, the
   verification service SHOULD include the error response code and
   reason phrase associated with the error in a Reason header field,
   defined in [RFC3326], in the next provisional or final responses sent
   to the authentication service.  The reason cause in the Reason header

Internet-Draft               Identity Errors               December 2021


   field SHOULD represent the error that occurred when verifying the
   contents of the Identity header field.  The association of a Reason
   header field and error to a specific Identity header field is
   accomplished by adding a "ppt" parameter containing the PASSporT that
   generated the error to the Reason header field.  The "ppt" parameter
   for the Reason header field is optional, but RECOMMENDED, in
   particular for cases that a SIP INVITE contains multiple Identity
   header fields.  The PASSporT can be included in full form, or
   optionally in compact form, where only the signature of the PASSporT
   is used to identify the reported Identity header field with an error.

   Example Reason header field with full form PASSporT:

   Reason: STIR ;cause=436 ;text="Bad Identity Info" ;ppt= \
   "eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6InBhc3Nwb3J0IiwieDV1I \

   ojNCpTzO3QfPOlckGaS6hEck7w"

   Example Reason header field with compact form PASSporT: ~~~~~~~~~~~
   Reason: STIR ;cause=436 ;text="Bad Identity Info" ;ppt= \
   "..rq3pjT1akEGjHCnWSwUnshd0-zJ6F1VOgFWSjHBr8Qjpjlk-cpFYpFYs \
   ojNCpTzO3QfPOlckGaS6hEck7w" ~~~~~~~~~~~

6.  Handling multiple verification errors

   If there are multiple Identity header field verification errors being
   reported the verification service SHOULD include corresponding Reason
   header fields with "ppt" parameters including full or compact form of
   the PASSporT with cause and text parameters identifying each error.
   As mentioned previously, the potential use of multiple Reason header
   fields defined in [RFC3326] is updated in [upcoming document TBD]
   allowing multiple Reason header fields with the same protocol value,
   for this specification being "STIR".

   Example Reason header fields for two identity info errors:

7.  Removal of the Reason header field by Authentication Service

   When an Authentication Service [RFC8224] receives the Reason header
   field with a PASSporT it generated as part of an Identity header
   field and the authentication of a call, it should first follow local
   policy to recognize and acknowledge the error (e.g. perform
   operational actions like logging or alarming), but then MUST remove
   the identified Reason header field to avoid the PASSporT information
   from going upstream to a UAC or UAS that may not be authorized to see
   claim information contained in the PASSporT for privacy or other
   reasons.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the definition of a new protocol value (and
   associated protocol cause) to be registered by the IANA into the
   "Reason Protocols" sub-registry under
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameter as follows:

   Protocol Value   Protocol Cause            Reference
   --------------   ---------------           -----------
   STIR              Status code               RFC 8224

9.  Acknowledgements

   Would like to thank David Hancock for help to identify these error
   scenarios and Jon Peterson, Roman Shpount, and STIR working group for
   helpful feedback and discussion.
