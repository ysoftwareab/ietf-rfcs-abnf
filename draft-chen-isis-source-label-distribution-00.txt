            Extensions to ISIS for Source Label Distribution
              draft-chen-isis-source-label-distribution-00

Abstract

   An MPLS Source Label (SL) is defined to identify a node that is (one
   of) the ingress LSRs to a specific LSP.  This document defines
   extensions to ISIS protocol for distribution of the mapping of an
   MPLS Source Label to an specific LSR.  Therefore, the egress and
   intermediate LSRs can determine from which LSR an MPLS packet is
   sent.

   This document also defines ISIS extensions to advertise the Source
   Label Capability (SLC) of each LSR that indicates whether an LSR can
   process the Source Label.  With the SLC, an ingress LSR can determine
   whether it is allowed to insert a Source Label into the label stack
   for a specific LSP.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.  Introduction

   The MPLS Source Label is defined in [I-D.chen-mpls-source-label], it
   is used to identify (one of) the ingress LSR(s) of an LSP.  To
   identify from where an MPLS packet is sent, a pure Source Label (SL)
   is not enough, it needs to know to which LSR a SL is correlated.
   Therefore, there needs a mechanism to distribute the mapping
   information between a SL and its correlated LSR.

   In addition, for an ingress LSR, before inserting a SL in the label
   stack of an LSP, it needs to know whether the egress LSR has the
   capability to process the SL, otherwise the packet will be dropped at
   the egress LSR.  The capability is called Source Label Capability
   (SLC).

   This document defines extensions to ISIS [RFC1195] protocol to
   distribute SL to LSR mapping and advertise the SLC of each LSR.

2.  Extensions to ISIS

   The Source Label sub-TLV is used to distribute the Source Label to
   LSR mapping and the SLC.  The Source Label sub-TLV is advertised
   within an IS-IS CAPABILITY TLV that is defined in [RFC4971], it has
   the following format:

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |              Type             |             Length            |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                           System ID                           |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |        System ID(cond.)       |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |        Reserved       |           Source Label                |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                    Figure 1 - ISIS Source Label sub-TLV format

   The value of Type field is TBD1.

   The Length field defines the length of the Reserved and Source Label
   in octets, the value is 4.

   The Source Label field contains the Source Label that identifies the
   advertising LSR.

3.  Elements of Procedure

   The Source Label sub-TLV is carried within an IS-IS CAPABILITY TLV
   defined in [RFC4971].  All the procedures that defined in [RFC4971]
   are inherited here.

   The flooding scope of the Source Label sub-TLV can be either area
   local or entire IGP domain.  The flooding scope is controlled by the
   S flag in the IS-IS Router Capability TLV [RFC4971].  If the flooding
   scope is area local, the Source Label sub-TLV MUST be carried within
   an IS-IS Router Capability TLV with the S flag clear.  If the
   flooding scope is the entire IGP domain, the Source Label sub-TLV
   MUST be carried within an IS-IS Router Capability TLV with the S flag
   set.

   The Source Label sub-TLV is an optional sub-TLV.  Upon receipt the
   sub-TLV, a router will silently ignore the sub-TLV as defined in
   [RFC4971] if it does not support it.  If Source Label sub-TLV is not
   present that MUST be interpreted as signaling of non-support of SLC

   by the LSR.  Presence of a Source Label sub-TLV MUST be interpreted
   as support of SLC by the LSR.  A Source Label sub-TLV MUST appear
   only one time in an LSP.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a new sub-TLV code point for the Source
   Label sub-TLV carried within the IS-IS Router Capability TLV.

   Type Value  TLV Name         Reference
