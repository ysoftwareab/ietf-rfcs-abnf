Abstract

    This document proposes the addition of new cipher suites to the TLS
    protocol 1.0 to support the Camellia encryption algorithm as a bulk
    cipher algorithm.  Please send comments on this document to the TLS
    mailing list.


1. Introduction

    This document proposes the addition of new cipher suites to the TLS
    protocol 1.0 [4] to support the Camellia encryption algorithm as a
    bulk cipher algorithm.  This proposal provides a new option for bulk
    cipher algorithms.

    Camellia is a block cipher with 128-bit block size and 128-, 192-,
    and 256-bit key sizes, i.e. the same interface specifications as the
    Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).  The algorithm description is in
    [1][3].  Efficiency on both software and hardware platforms is a
    remarkable characteristic of Camellia in addition to its high level
    of security.  It is confirmed that Camellia provides strong security

    against differential and linear cryptanalysis.  An optimized
    implementation of Camellia in assembly language can encrypt on a
    Pentium III (1.13GHz) at the rate of 471 Mbits per second.  In
    addition, a distinguishing feature is its small hardware design.
    The hardware design, which includes the parts for key schedule,
    encryption and decryption, occupies only 9.66K gates using a 0.35um
    CMOS ASIC library, which is in the smallest class among all existing
    128-bit block ciphers as far as we know [2].


2. Cipher Suites

    We propose the new cipher suites below following the AES
    ciphersuites.

    CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA      = { 0x00,0x41 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA   = { 0x00,0x42 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA   = { 0x00,0x43 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA  = { 0x00,0x44 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA  = { 0x00,0x45 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA  = { 0x00,0x46 };

    CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA      = { 0x00,0x47 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA   = { 0x00,0x48 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA   = { 0x00,0x49 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA  = { 0x00,0x4A };
    CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA  = { 0x00,0x4B };
    CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA  = { 0x00,0x4C };

    Note: The above numeric definitions for Cipher Suites have not yet
    been registered.  The numeric definitions follow the numbers given
    in the CipherSuite of the TLS standard.

4. Security Considerations 

    Security considerations except Camellia are discussed in [4]. The
    security of Camellia is evaluated by utilizing state-of-the-art
    cryptanalytic techniques.  We confirmed that Camellia has no
    differential and linear characteristics that hold with probability
    more than 2^(-128), which means that it is extremely unlikely that
    differential and linear attacks will succeed against Camellia.
    Moreover, Camellia was designed to offer security against other
    advanced cryptanalytic attacks including higher order differential
    attacks, interpolation attacks, related-key attacks, truncated
    differential attacks, and so on [3]. 


5. Intellectual Property Statement

    Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (Mitsubishi Electric) and Nippon
    Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) have pending applications
    or filed patents which are essential to Camellia.  License policy
    for these essential patents declared formally by NTT and Mitsubishi
    Electric will be available on the IETF page of Intellectual Property
    Rights Notices.
