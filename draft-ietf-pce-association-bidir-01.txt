                         PCEP Extensions for 
         Associated Bidirectional Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
                draft-ietf-pce-association-bidir-01

Abstract

   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
   computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.
    The Stateful PCE extensions allow stateful control of Multiprotocol
   Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths
   (LSPs) using PCEP.

   This document defines PCEP extensions for grouping two reverse
   unidirectional MPLS TE LSPs into an Associated Bidirectional LSP when
   using a Stateful PCE for both PCE-Initiated and PCC-Initiated LSPs as
   well as when using a Stateless PCE.

Internet-Draft   PCEP For Associated Bidirectional LSPs     May 18, 2018


1.  Introduction

   [RFC5440] describes the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) as a
   communication mechanism between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a
   Path Control Element (PCE), or between PCE and PCC, that enables
   computation of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic
   Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs).

   [RFC8231] specifies extensions to PCEP to enable stateful control of
   MPLS TE LSPs.  It describes two modes of operation - Passive Stateful
   PCE and Active Stateful PCE.  In [RFC8231], the focus is on Active
   Stateful PCE where LSPs are provisioned on the PCC and control over
   them is delegated to a PCE.  Further, [RFC8281] describes the setup,
   maintenance and teardown of PCE-Initiated LSPs for the Stateful PCE
   model.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-association] introduces a generic mechanism to create a
   grouping of LSPs which can then be used to define associations
   between a set of LSPs and/or a set of attributes, for example primary
   and secondary LSP associations, and is equally applicable to the
   active and passive modes of a Stateful PCE [RFC8231] or a stateless
   PCE [RFC5440].

   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) requirements document [RFC5654]
   specifies that MPLS-TP MUST support associated bidirectional
   point-to-point LSPs.  [RFC7551] defines RSVP signaling extensions for
   binding two reverse unidirectional LSPs [RFC3209] into an associated
   bidirectional LSP.  The fast reroute (FRR) procedures for associated
   bidirectional LSPs are described in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-assoc-corouted-bidir-frr].

   This document specifies PCEP extensions for grouping two reverse
   unidirectional MPLS-TE LSPs into an Associated Bidirectional LSP for
   both single-sided and double-sided initiation cases when using a
   Stateful (both active and passive modes) or Stateless PCE.  The PCEP
   extensions cover the following cases:

   o  A PCC initiates the forward and/ or reverse LSP of a single-sided
      or double-sided bidirectional LSP and retains the control of the
      LSP.  The PCC computes the path itself or makes a request for path
      computation to a PCE.  After the path setup, it reports the
      information and state of the path to the PCE.  This includes the
      association group identifying the bidirectional LSP.  This is the
      Passive Stateful mode defined in [RFC8051].

   o  A PCC initiates the forward and/ or reverse LSP of a single-sided
      or double-sided bidirectional LSP and delegates the control of the
      LSP to a Stateful PCE.  During delegation the association group

Internet-Draft   PCEP For Associated Bidirectional LSPs     May 18, 2018


      identifying the bidirectional LSP is included.  The PCE computes
      the path of the LSP and updates the PCC with the information about
      the path as long as it controls the LSP.  This is the Active
      Stateful mode defined in [RFC8051].

   o  A PCE initiates the forward and/ or reverse LSP of a single-sided
      or double-sided bidirectional LSP on a PCC and retains the control
      of the LSP.  The PCE is responsible for computing the path of the
      LSP and updating the PCC with the information about the path as
      well as the association group identifying the bidirectional LSP. 
      This is the PCE-Initiated mode defined in [RFC8281].

   o  A PCC requests co-routed or non co-routed paths for forward and
      reverse LSPs of a bidirectional LSP from a Stateless PCE
      [RFC5440].

   sections.

3.1.  Single-sided Initiation

   As specified in [RFC7551], in the single-sided case, the
   bidirectional tunnel is provisioned only on one endpoint node (PCC)
   of the tunnel.  Both forward and reverse LSPs of this tunnel are
   initiated with the Association Type set to "Single-sided
   Bidirectional LSP Association" on the originating endpoint node.  The
   forward and reverse LSPs are identified in the Bidirectional LSP
   Association Group TLV of their PCEP Association Objects.

   The originating endpoint node signals the properties for the revere
   LSP in the RSVP REVERSE_LSP Object [RFC7551] of the forward LSP Path
   message.  The remote endpoint then creates the corresponding reverse
   tunnel and signals the reverse LSP in response to the received RSVP
   Path message.  Similarly, the remote endpoint node deletes the
   reverse LSP when it receives the RSVP Path delete message [RFC3209]
   for the forward LSP.  

   The originating endpoint (PCC) node may report/ delegate the forward
   and reverse LSPs to a PCE.  The remote endpoint (PCC) node may report
   the reverse LSP to a PCE.

    Figure 2B: Example of PCC-Initiated Single-sided Bidirectional LSP

   As shown in Figures 2A and 2B, the forward tunnel and both forward
   LSP1 and reverse LSP2 are initiated on the originating endpoint node
   A, either by the PCE or the originating PCC.  The originating
   endpoint node A signals the properties of reverse LSP2 in the RSVP
   REVERSE_LSP Object in the Path message of the forward LSP1.  The
   creation of reverse tunnel and reverse LSP2 on the remote endpoint
   node D is triggered by the RSVP signaled forward LSP1.

   As specified in [I-D.ietf-teas-assoc-corouted-bidir-frr], for fast
   reroute bypass tunnel assignment, the LSP starting from the
   originating node is identified as the forward LSP of the single-sided
   initiated bidirectional LSP.

3.2.  Double-sided Initiation

   As specified in [RFC7551], in the double-sided case, the
   bidirectional tunnel is provisioned on both endpoint nodes (PCCs) of
   the tunnel.  The forward and reverse LSPs of this tunnel are
   initiated with the Association Type set to "Double-sided
   Bidirectional LSP Association" on both endpoint nodes.  The forward
   and reverse LSPs are identified in the Bidirectional LSP Association
   Group TLV of their Association Objects.

   reverse LSP2 are initiated on the endpoint node D, either by the PCE
   or the PCCs.

   As specified in [I-D.ietf-teas-assoc-corouted-bidir-frr], for fast

   In both single-sided and double-sided initiation cases, forward and

   forward and reverse LSPs of a bidirectional LSP follow the same
   congruent path in the forward and reverse directions, respectively.

4.  Protocol Extensions

4.1.  Association Object

   As per [I-D.ietf-pce-association], LSPs are associated by adding them
   to a common association group.  This document defines two new
   Bidirectional LSP Association Groups to be used by the associated
   bidirectional LSPs.  A member of the Bidirectional LSP Association
   Group can take the role of a forward or reverse LSP and follows the
   following rules:

   o  An LSP (forward or reverse) can not be part of more than one
      Bidirectional LSP Association Group.  More than one forward LSP
      and/ or reverse LSP can be part of a Bidirectional LSP Association
      Group.

   o  The Tunnel (as defined in [RFC3209]) of forward and reverse LSPs
      of the single-sided bidirectional LSP association on the
      originating node MUST be the same.


   This document defines two new Association Types for the Association
   Object as follows:

   o  Association Type (TBD1) = Single-sided Bidirectional LSP
      Association Group

   o  Association Type (TBD2) = Double-sided Bidirectional LSP
      Association Group

   These Association Types are operator-configured associations in
   nature and statically created by the operator on the PCEP peers.  The
   LSP belonging to these associations is conveyed via PCEP messages to
   the PCEP peer.  Operator-configured Association Range TLV
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association] MUST NOT be sent for these Association
   Types, and MUST be ignored, so that the entire range of association
   ID can be used for them.

   The Association ID, Association Source, optional Global Association

   Source and optional Extended Association ID in the Bidirectional LSP
   Association Group Object are initialized using the procedures defined
   in [I-D.ietf-pce-association] and [RFC7551].

4.2.  Bidirectional LSP Association Group TLV

   The Bidirectional LSP Association Group TLV is defined for use with
   the Single-sided and Double-sided Bidirectional LSP Association Group
   Object Types.

   o  The Bidirectional LSP Association Group TLV follows the PCEP TLV
      format from [RFC5440].

   o  The Type (16 bits) of the TLV is TBD3, to be assigned by IANA.

   o  The Length is 4 Bytes.

   o  The value comprises of a single field, the Bidirectional LSP
      Association Flags (32 bits), where each bit represents a flag
      option.

   o  If the Bidirectional LSP Association Group TLV is missing, it
      means the LSP is the forward LSP and it is not co-routed LSP.  

   o  For co-routed LSPs, this TLV MUST be present.

   o  For reverse LSPs, this TLV MUST be present.

   o  The Bidirectional LSP Association Group TLV MUST NOT be present
      more than once.  If it appears more than once, only the first
      occurrence is processed and any others MUST be ignored.

   The format of the Bidirectional LSP Association Group TLV is shown in
   Figure 5:


    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   F (Forward LSP, 1 bit) - Indicates whether the LSP associated is the
     forward LSP of the bidirectional LSP.  If this flag is set, the LSP
     is a forward LSP.

   R (Reverse LSP, 1 bit) - Indicates whether the LSP associated is the
     reverse LSP of the bidirectional LSP.  If this flag is set, the LSP
     is a reverse LSP.

   C (Co-routed LSP, 1 bit) - Indicates whether the bidirectional LSP is
     co-routed.  This flag MUST be set for both the forward and reverse
     LSPs of a co-routed bidirectional LSP.

   The C flag is used by the PCE (for both Stateful and Stateless) to
   compute bidirectional paths of the forward and reverse LSPs of a
   co-routed bidirectional LSP.

   The Reserved flags MUST be set to 0 when sent and MUST be ignored
   when received.


5.  PCEP Procedure

5.1.  PCE Initiated LSPs

   As specified in [I-D.ietf-pce-association], Bidirectional LSP
   Association Groups can be created by a Stateful PCE.

   o  Stateful PCE can create and update the forward and reverse LSPs
      independently for both single-sided and double-sided bidirectional
      LSP association groups.

   o  Stateful PCE can establish and remove the association relationship
      on a per LSP basis.  

   o  Stateful PCE can create and update the LSP and the association on
      a PCC via PCInitiate and PCUpd messages, respectively, using the
      procedures described in [I-D.ietf-pce-association].

5.2.  PCC Initiated LSPs

   As specified in [I-D.ietf-pce-association], Bidirectional LSP
   Association Groups can also be created by a PCC.

   o  PCC can create and update the forward and reverse LSPs
      independently for both single-sided and double-sided bidirectional
      LSP association groups. 

   o  PCC can establish and remove the association relationship on a per

Internet-Draft   PCEP For Associated Bidirectional LSPs     May 18, 2018


      LSP basis.  

   o  PCC MUST report the change in the association group of an LSP to
      PCE(s) via PCRpt message.

   o  PCC can report the forward and reverse LSPs independently to
      PCE(s) via PCRpt message.

   o  PCC can delegate the forward and reverse LSPs independently to a
      Stateful PCE, where PCE would control the LSPs.  For single-sided
      case, originating (PCC) node can delegate both forward and reverse
      LSPs of a tunnel together to a Stateful PCE in order to avoid any
      race condition.

   o  Stateful PCE can update the LSPs in the bidirectional LSP
      association group via PCUpd message, using the procedures
      described in [I-D.ietf-pce-association].

5.3.  Stateless PCE

   For a stateless PCE, it might be useful to associate a path
   computation request to an association group, thus enabling it to
   associate a common set of configuration parameters or behaviors with
   the request.  A PCC can request co-routed or non co-routed forward
   and reverse direction paths from a stateless PCE for a bidirectional
   LSP association group.

5.4.  State Synchronization

   During state synchronization, a PCC MUST report all the existing
   bidirectional LSP association groups to the Stateful PCE as per
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association].  After the state synchronization, the PCE
   MUST remove all stale bidirectional LSP associations.

5.5.  Error Handling

   An LSP (forward or reverse) can not be part of more than one
   Bidirectional LSP Association Group.  If a PCE attempts to add an LSP
   not complying to this rule, the PCC MUST send PCErr with Error-Type =
   29 (Early allocation by IANA) (Association Error) and Error-Value =
   TBD4 (Bidirectional LSP Association - Group Mismatch).  Similarly, if
   a PCC attempts to add an LSP at PCE not complying to this rule, the
   PCE MUST send this PCErr.

   The LSPs (forward or reverse) in a single-sided bidirectional LSP
   association group MUST belong to the same TE Tunnel (as defined in
   [RFC3209]).  If a PCE attempts to add an LSP in a single-sided
   bidirectional LSP association group for a different Tunnel, the PCC

Internet-Draft   PCEP For Associated Bidirectional LSPs     May 18, 2018


   MUST send PCErr with Error-Type = 29 (Early allocation by IANA)
   (Association Error) and Error-Value = TBD5 (Bidirectional LSP
   Association - Tunnel Mismatch).  Similarly, if a PCC attempts to add
   an LSP to a single-sided bidirectional LSP association group at PCE
   not complying to this rule, the PCE MUST send this PCErr.


6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations described in [RFC5440], [RFC8231], and
   [RFC8281] apply to the extensions defined in this document as well. 

   Two new Association Types for the Association Object, Single-sided
   Bidirectional LSP Association Group and Double-sided Associated
   Bidirectional LSP Group are introduced in this document.  Additional
   security considerations related to LSP associations due to a
   malicious PCEP speaker is described in [I-D.ietf-pce-association] and
   apply to these Association Types.  Hence, securing the PCEP session
   using Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC8253] is recommended.


7.  Manageability Considerations

7.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   The mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any control or
   policy requirements in addition to those already listed in [RFC5440],
   [RFC8231], and [RFC8281].

7.2.  Information and Data Models

   [RFC7420] describes the PCEP MIB, there are no new MIB Objects
   defined for LSP associations.

   The PCEP YANG module [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-yang] supports LSP
   associations.

7.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   The mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new liveness
   detection and monitoring requirements in addition to those already
   listed in [RFC5440], [RFC8231], and [RFC8281].

7.4.  Verify Correct Operations

   The mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new
   operation verification requirements in addition to those already
   listed in [RFC5440], [RFC8231], and [RFC8281].

7.5.  Requirements On Other Protocols

   The mechanisms defined in this document do not add any new
   requirements on other protocols.

7.6.  Impact On Network Operations

   The mechanisms defined in this document do not have any impact on
   network operations in addition to those already listed in [RFC5440],
   [RFC8231], and [RFC8281].


8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  Association Types

   This document adds new Association Types for the Association Object
   defined [I-D.ietf-pce-association].  IANA is requested to make the
   assignment of values for the sub-registry "ASSOCIATION Type Field"
   (to be created in [I-D.ietf-pce-association]), as follows:

   Value Name                                            Reference
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   TBD1 Single-sided Bidirectional LSP Association Group [This document]
   TBD2 Double-sided Bidirectional LSP Association Group [This document]

8.2.  Bidirectional LSP Association Group TLV

   This document defines a new TLV for carrying additional information
   of LSPs within a Bidirectional LSP Association Group.  IANA is
   requested to add the assignment of a new value in the existing "PCEP
   TLV Type Indicators" registry as follows:

   TLV-Type  Name                                      Reference   
   -------------------------------------------------------------------
    TBD3     Bidirectional LSP Association Group TLV   [This document]

8.2.1.  Flag Fields in Bidirectional LSP Association Group TLV

   This document requests that a new sub-registry, named "Bidirectional
   LSP Association Group TLV Flag Field", is created within the "Path
   Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers" registry to manage the
   Flag field in the Bidirectional LSP Association Group TLV.  New
   values are to be assigned by Standards Action [RFC8126].  Each bit
   should be tracked with the following qualities:

      o  Bit number (count from 0 as the most significant bit)

    29         C - Co-routed LSP             [This document]

8.3.  PCEP Errors

   This document defines new Error value for Error Type 29 (Association
   Error).  IANA is requested to allocate new Error value within the
   "PCEP-ERROR Object Error Types and Values" sub-registry of the PCEP
   Numbers registry, as follows:

   Error Type  Description                               Reference
