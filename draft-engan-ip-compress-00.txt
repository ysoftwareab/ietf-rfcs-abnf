      This document describes an  option  for  negotiating  the  use  of
      header  compression on IP datagrams transmitted over the Point-to-
      Point Protocol [RFC1661]. It defines extensions to the PPP Control
      Protocols for IPv4 and IPv6 [RFC1332, RFC2023]. Header compression
      may be applied to IPv4 and IPv6 datagrams in combination with TCP,
      UDP  and  RTP  transport  protocols  as  specified in [IPv6HC] and
      [CRTP].

1. Introduction

   In order to establish compression of IP datagrams  sent  over  a  PPP
   link each end of the link must agree on a set of configuration param-
   eters for the compression. The process of negotiating link parameters
   for  network layer protocols is handled in PPP by a family of network
   control protocols (NCPs).

   The IPv6 Header Compression defined  in  [IPv6HC]  may  be  used  for
   compression  of  both IPv4 and IPv6 datagrams or packets encapsulated
   with multiple IP headers. The IP/UDP/RTP header  compression  defined
   in  [CRTP]  fits  within the framework defined by [IPv6HC] so that it
   may also be applied to both IPv4 and IPv6 packets.  Since  there  are
   separate  NCPs for IPv4 and IPv6, this document defines configuration
   options to be used in both  NCPs  to  negotiate  parameters  for  the
   compression scheme.

   IP header compression relies on the link layer's ability to  indicate
   the  types  of  datagrams  carried in the link layer frames.  In this
   document nine new types for the PPP Data Link  Layer  Protocol  Field
   are  defined  along  with  their  meaning.  Numeric values need to be
   assigned for these nine new types.


2. Configuration Option

   In order for PPP to accomodate new header  compression  protocols  it
   must  be  possible  to negotiate a set of parameters for each enabled
   header compression protocol. The specification of  link  and  network
   layer  parameter  negotiation for PPP [RFC1661], [RFC1331], [RFC1332]
   does not prohibit multiple instances of one configuration option  but
   states  that  the specification of a configuration option must expli-
   citly allow multiple instances.  From the  current  specification  of
   the  IPCP IP-Compression-Protocol configuration option [RFC1332, p 6]
   it follows that it can only be used to select  a  single  compression
   protocol at any given time.

   There are at least three alternative approaches for  the  integration
   of  IPv6  and RTP header compression parameter negotiation into IPCP.
   The sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 below explains three  alternatives,  in
   decreasing order of preference.


2.1. Alternative A (preferred)

   Add words to the IPCP specification to allow  multiple  instances  of
   the  IP-Compression-Protocol  configuration  option  and  use the new
   option described in section 2.4 with a different compression protocol

Internet Draft       draft-engan-ip-compress-00.txt           April 1997


   value  to  select the IPv6 and/or RTP header compression protocol and
   their parameters.  Options for negotiation of parameters  for  other,
   new  header  compression  protocols  would  be easy to add.  If it is
   desirable, the negotiation of  UDP/RTP  and  TCP  header  compression
   could  be  separated into individual options.  Negotiation of parame-
   ters for Van Jacobson TCP/IP header compression is not made with  the
   new option.

   An implementation that supports  more  than  one  scheme  for  header
   compression  should be able to include multiple instances of the IPCP
   IP-Compression-Protocol option in a configure request.   An  existing
   implementation   that  supports  only  classic  Van  Jacobson  header
   compression should be able to safely reject multiple  IP-Compression-
   Protocol  options  and  options  specifying  other header compression
   schemes than Van Jacobson header compression.  However,  there  might
   exist  implementations  that  do  not  handle the proposed new option
   and/or multiple IP-Compression-Protocol options correctly which could
   be detrimental to backwards compatibility.


2.2. Alternative B

   Add a new configuration option type to IPCP with, apart from allowing
   multiple  instances,  the  same  meaning  as the IPCP IP-Compression-
   Protocol option.

   Classic Van Jacobson compression could still be negotiated  with  the
   old  option  type thus guaranteeing interoperability with implementa-
   tions that do not support IPv6 Header Compression  or  the  new  IPCP
   option  type.   Negotiation  of  parameters  for  IPv6 and RTP header
   compression is made with the new option  described  in  section  2.4.
   Options  for negotiation of parameters for other, new header compres-
   sion protocols would be easy to add.  If it is desirable,  the  nego-
   tiation of UDP/RTP and TCP header compression could be separated into
   individual options.


2.3. Alternative C

   Use the IPCP IP-Compression-Protocol option as specified in [RFC1332]
   but  use  a different compression protocol value to select a new com-
   pound option to simultaneously negotiate parameters  for  classic  VJ
   compression  as  well  as  for  the  new header compression protocols
   defined in [IPv6HC] and [CRTP].  The new option is  as  described  in
   section 2.4, including the flags for negotiation of VJ compression.

   The option format would be  structured  to  allow  selection  of  any
   desired  combination  of  the currently defined compression protocols

Internet Draft       draft-engan-ip-compress-00.txt           April 1997


   using a set of flag bits.  Additional flag bits may be defined in the
   future  to  add other compression protocols.  Aggregating negotiation
   of parameters for all future  compression  protocols  into  a  single
   option  implies that the specification of the option would need to be
   changed whenever a new header compression scheme is standardised.


2.4. Configuration Option Format

   Both the network control protocol for IPv4, IPCP  [RFC1332]  and  the
   IPv6  NCP,  IPV6CP  [RFC2023]  may  be  used  to  negotiate IP Header
   Compression parameters for their respective protocols.  The format of
   the  configuration option is the same for both IPCP and IPV6CP except
   for two flags, the S and V flags. Those are used only in  IPCP  since
   there  are no definition of Van Jacobson style TCP/IP header compres-
   sion for IPv6.


   Description

      This NCP configuration option is used to negotiate parameters  for
      IP  Header  Compression.   The  option format is summarized below.

         When  V  =  1,  indicates  that  the  slot  identifier  may  be
         compressed [RFC1332].

         This bit is not defined in the configuration option for IPv6CP.

      [V] VJ_COMPRESSION (used only in Alternative C)
         Enable use of Protocol Identifiers (hex) 002D and 002F for  Van
         Jacobson  TCP header compression. This bit duplicates the func-
         tion  of  the  IP-Compression-Protocol   configuration   option
         defined in [RFC1332] to allow the use of VJ compression in com-
         bination with other compression modes.

         This bit is not defined in the configuration option for IPv6CP.

   TCP_SPACE
      The TCP_SPACE field is  two  octets  and  indicates  the   maximum
      value  of a connection identifier in the space of connection iden-
      tifiers allocated for TCP.

Internet Draft       draft-engan-ip-compress-00.txt           April 1997


         Suggested value: 15

      TCP_SPACE must be at least 3 and at most 255.

   NON_TCP_SPACE
      The NON_TCP_SPACE field is two octets and  indicates  the  maximum
      value  of a connection identifier in the space of connection iden-
      tifiers allocated for non-TCP. These  connection  identifiers  are
      carried  in  COMPRESSED_NON_TCP, COMPRESSED_UDP and COMPRESSED_RTP
      packet headers.

         Suggested value: 15

      NON_TCP_SPACE must be at least 3 and at most 65535.

   F_MAX_PERIOD
      Maximum interval between full headers.  No more than  F_MAX_PERIOD
      COMPRESSED_NON_TCP   headers   may  be  sent  between  FULL_HEADER
      headers.

         Suggested value: 256

      A value of zero implies infinity.

   F_MAX_TIME
      Maximum time interval between  full  headers.   COMPRESSED_NON_TCP
      headers may not be sent more than F_MAX_TIME seconds after sending
      the last FULL_HEADER header.

         Suggested value: 5 seconds

      A value of zero implies infinity.

   MAX_HEADER
      The largest header size in octets that may be compressed.

         Suggested value: 168 octets

      The value of MAX_HEADER should be large enough so  that  at  least
      the  outer  network  layer  header can be compressed.  To increase
      compression efficiency MAX_HEADER should be set to a  value  large
      enough to cover common combinations of network and transport layer
      headers.

3. Multiple Network Control Protocols

   The IP Header Compression protocol is able to compress both IPv6  and
   IPv4  datagrams.  Both  IPCP  and IPV6CP are able to negotiate option
   parameter values for IP Header Compression.  These  values  apply  to
   the  compression  of packets where the outer header is an IPv4 header
   and an IPv6 header, respectively.


3.1. Sharing Connection Identifier Space

   For the compression and  decompression  of  IPv4  and  IPv6  datagram
   headers the connection identifier space is shared.  While the parame-
   ter values are independently negotiated, sharing the connection iden-
   tifiers spaces becomes more complex when the parameter values differ.
   Since the compressed packets share connection identifier  space,  the
   compression engine must allocate connection identifiers out of a com-
   mon pool; for compressed packets, the decompressor has to examine the
   connection  state  to determine what parameters to use for decompres-
   sion.

   Connection  identifier  space  is  not  shared  between  IPv6  Header
   Compression  (TCP)  and  classic, Van Jacobson TCP/IP header compres-
   sion.  Connection identifiers spaces are not shared between  TCP  and
   non-TCP/UDP/RTP.   Doing  so  would  require additional mechanisms to
   ensure that no error can occur when switching from using a connection
   identifier  for TCP to non-TCP.  Similarly, additional checks must be
   made if the connection identifier spaces of IPv6  Header  Compression
   (TCP) is shared with classical, VJ style TCP/IP header compression to
   ensure that no errors occur when changing what compression  algorithm
   is associated with a connection identifier.


4. Demultiplexing of Datagrams

   The specification of IPv6 Header Compression  [IPv6HC]  defines  four
   header  formats  for  different types of compressed headers. They are
   compressed TCP, compressed TCP with  no  delta  encoding,  compressed
   non-TCP  with  8 bit CID and compressed non-TCP with 16 bit CID.  The
   two non-TCP formats may be distinguished by their  contents  so  both
   may  use  the same link-level identifier.  A fifth header format, the
   full header is distinct from a regular  header  in  that  it  carries
   additional  information  to  establish  shared  context  between  the
   compressor and decompressor.

   The specification of IP/UDP/RTP  Header  Compression  [CRTP]  defines
   four   additional  formats  of  compressed  headers.   They  are  for
   compressed UDP and compressed RTP (on top of UDP), both  with  either

   8-  or  16-bit CIDs.  In addition, there is an explicit error message
   from the decompressor to the compressor.

   The link layer must be able to indicate  these  header  formats  with
   distinct  values.  Nine PPP Data Link Layer Protocol Field values are
   specified below.

   FULL_HEADER
      The frame contains a full header as specified  in  [CRTP]  Section
      3.3.1.  This  is the same as the FULL_HEADER specified in [IPv6HC]
      Section 5.3.
         Value: TO BE ASSIGNED 1

   COMPRESSED_TCP
      The frame contains a datagram with a compressed  header  with  the
      format as specified in [IPv6HC] Section 6a.
         Value: TO BE ASSIGNED 2

   COMPRESSED_TCP_NODELTA
      The frame contains a datagram with a compressed  header  with  the
      format as specified in [IPv6HC] Section 6b.
         Value: TO BE ASSIGNED 3

   COMPRESSED_NON_TCP
      The frame contains a datagram with a compressed  header  with  the
      format  as  specified  in  either  Section  6c  or  Section  6d of
      [IPv6HC].
         Value: TO BE ASSIGNED 4

   COMPRESSED_RTP_8
      The frame contains a datagram with a compressed  header  with  the
      format as specified in [CRTP] Section 3.3.2, using 8-bit CIDs.
         Value: TO BE ASSIGNED 5

   COMPRESSED_RTP_16
      The frame contains a datagram with a compressed  header  with  the
      format as specified in [CRTP] Section 3.3.2, using 16-bit CIDs.
         Value: TO BE ASSIGNED 6

   COMPRESSED_UDP_8
      The frame contains a datagram with a compressed  header  with  the
      format as specified in [CRTP] Section 3.3.3, using 8-bit CIDs.
         Value: TO BE ASSIGNED 7

   COMPRESSED_UDP_16
      The frame contains a datagram with a compressed  header  with  the
      format as specified in [CRTP] Section 3.3.3, using 16-bit CIDs.
         Value: TO BE ASSIGNED 8

   CONTEXT_STATE
      The frame is a link-level message sent from  the  decompressor  to
      the compressor as specified in [CRTP] Section 3.3.5.
         Value: TO BE ASSIGNED 9


4.1. Protocol Identifiers

   Four 8-bit and five 16-bit protocol identifiers are required for  the
   combined  IPv6  and RTP header compression schemes. If protocol iden-
   tifiers in the range 0x20-0xff are available, allocation of  protocol
   identifiers  for  IPv6  and RTP header compression from that range is
   preferred.


           Proto ID                 Size     Value
           FULL_HEADER              16 bit   TO BE ASSIGNED 1
           COMPRESSED_TCP           8 bit    TO BE ASSIGNED 2
           COMPRESSED_TCP_NODELTA   16 bit   TO BE ASSIGNED 3
           COMPRESSED_NON_TCP       8 bit    TO BE ASSIGNED 4
           COMPRESSED_RTP_8         8 bit    TO BE ASSIGNED 5
           COMPRESSED_RTP_16        16 bit   TO BE ASSIGNED 6
           COMPRESSED_UDP_8         8 bit    TO BE ASSIGNED 7
           COMPRESSED_UCP_16        16 bit   TO BE ASSIGNED 8
           CONTEXT_STATE            16 bit   TO BE ASSIGNED 9


   If there are no previously unused protocol identifiers in  the  0x20-
   0xff  range the required 8-bit protocol identifiers could probably be
   allocated from the 0x03-0x1f range. Should it be the case that exist-
   ing implementations require that characters in the range 0x03-0x1f be
   escaped, using protocol identifiers from that range  for  identifica-
   tion  of  compressed packets would gain nothing compared to using 16-
   bit protocol identifiers.

6. Security Considerations

   The use of header compression can, in  rare  cases,  cause  the  mis-
   delivery of packets. If necessary, confidentiality of packet contents
   should be assured by encryption. Encryption applied at the  IP  layer
   (e.g.,  using  IPSEC  mechanisms) precludes header compression of the
   encrypted headers, though compression of  the  outer  IP  header  and
   authentication/security  headers  is  still  possible as described in
   [IPv6HC].  For RTP packets, full header compression  is  possible  if
   the  RTP payload is encrypted by itself without encrypting the UDP or
   RTP headers, as described in [RFC1889].  This method  is  appropriate
   when  the  UDP  and RTP header information need not be kept confiden-
   tial.

   Negotiation of the option defined here imposes no additional security
   considerations beyond those that otherwise apply to PPP [RFC1661].
