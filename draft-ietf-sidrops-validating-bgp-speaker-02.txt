              draft-ietf-sidrops-validating-bgp-speaker-02

Abstract

   This document defines a new BGP transitive extended community, as
   well as its usage, to signal prefix origin validation results from an
   RPKI Origin validating BGP speaker to other BGP peers.  Upon
   reception of prefix origin validation results, peers can use this
   information in their local routing decision process.

1.  Introduction

   RPKI-based prefix origin validation [RFC6480] can be a significant
   operational burden for BGP peers to implement and adopt.  To
   facilitate acceptance and usage of prefix origin validation and
   ultimately increase the security of the Internet routing system,
   Autonomous Systems may provide RPKI-based prefix origin validation at
   certain vantage points.  The result of this prefix origin validation
   is signaled to peers by using the EBGP Prefix Origin Validation State
   Extended Community as introduced in this document.

Internet-DraSignaling Prefix Origin Validation Results from   March 2018


   Peers receiving a prefix origin validation result from the validating
   EBGP peer can use this information in their local routing decision
   process for acceptance, rejection, preference, or other traffic
   engineering purposes of a particular route.

2.  EBGP Prefix Origin Validation Extended Community

   The origin validation state extended community is a transitive Four-
   octet AS Specific Extended Community [RFC5668] with the following
   encoding:

     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |       0x02    |TBD1 (Sub-Type)|     Global Administrator      :
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    :  Global Administrator (cont.) |       Validation State        |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                                 Figure 1

   The value of the high-order octet of the extended Type field is 0x02,
   which indicates it is transitive.  The value of the low-order octet
   (Sub-Type) of the extended Type field as assigned by IANA is TBD1.
   The Reserved field MUST be set to 0 and ignored upon receipt of this
   community.  The Global Administrator field MUST be set to the AS
   number of the validating BGP speaker conducting the prefix origin
   validation.  The last octets of the extended community is an unsigned
   integer that gives the route's validation state as described in
   Section 4.

   If the validating BGP speaker is configured to support the extensions
   defined in this document, it SHOULD attach the origin validation
   state extended community to BGP UPDATE messages sent to EBGP peers by
   mapping the computed validation state in the last octet of the
   extended community.  A receiving BGP speaker, in the absence of a
   local validation state, SHOULD derive a validation state from the
   last octet of the received extended community, if present.

   An implementation SHOULD NOT send more than one instance of the
   origin validation state extended community.  However, if more than
   one instance is received, an implementation MUST disregard all
   instances other than the one with the numerically greatest validation
   state value.  If the value received is greater than the largest
   specified value (2), the implementation MUST apply a strategy similar
   to attribute discard [RFC7606] by discarding the erroneous community
   and logging the error for further analysis.

3.  BGP Prefix Origin Validation State Utilized at Validating Peers

   A validating BGP speaker that is aware of a BGP Prefix Origin
   Validation state (see Section 4) for a certain route can handle this
   information in one of the following modes of operation, attaching
   validation state to routes as discussed in Section 2:

   Simple Tagging:  In this mode of operation, the BGP best path
       selection algorithm is executed.  The prefix origin validation
       state is tagged accordingly.

   Dropping and Tagging:  Routes for which the prefix origin validation
       state is "invalid" (according to [RFC6811]) are dropped by the
       validating BGP speaker.  Based on the remaining set of routes,
       the BGP best path selection algorithm is executed.  The prefix
       origin validation state of "not found" or "valid" (according to
       [RFC6811]) is tagged accordingly.

   Strict Dropping and Tagging:  Routes for which the prefix origin
       validation state is "invalid" or "not found" (according to
       [RFC6811]) are dropped by the validating BGP speaker.  Based on
       the remaining set of routes, the BGP best path selection
       algorithm is executed.  The prefix origin validation state of
       "valid" is tagged to the advertised route.

   A validating BGP speaker MUST support the Simple Tagging operation
   mode.  Other modes of operation are OPTIONAL.  The mode of operation
   MAY be configured by the validating BGP speaker operator for all
   connected peers, or for each BGP session with a peer separately.

   Path hiding, as originally discussed in [RFC7947], may impact end-to-
   end connectivity for peers receiving prefixes via validating BGP
   speakers, if the best path selected contains a prefix with a prefix
   origin validation state which is subsequently dropped.

   However, these modes of operation might be used in combination with
   any options discussed in Section 2.3.2 of [RFC7947] in order to allow
   a peer to receive one or more routes and take the routing decision by
   itself, or with implementations who support sending the next best
   available path.

4.  Signaling Prefix Origin Validation Results from a Validating Peer to
    Peers

   The EBGP Prefix Origin Validation State Community is utilized for
   signaling prefix origin validation result from a validating BGP
   speaker to other peers.

Internet-DraSignaling Prefix Origin Validation Results from   March 2018


   This draft proposes an encoding of the prefix origin validation
   result [RFC6811] as follows:

                  +-------+-----------------------------+
                  | Value | Meaning                     |
                  +-------+-----------------------------+
                  |   0   | Lookup result = "valid"     |
                  |   1   | Lookup result = "not found" |
                  |   2   | Lookup result = "invalid"   |
                  +-------+-----------------------------+

                                  Table 1

   This encoding is re-used.  Validating peers providing RPKI-based
   prefix origin validation set the validation state according to the
   prefix origin validation result (see [RFC6811]).

5.  Operational Recommendations

5.1.  Local Routing Decision Process

   A peer receiving prefix origin validation results from the route
   server MAY use the information in its own local routing decision
   process.  The local routing decision process SHOULD apply to the
   rules as described in Section 5 [RFC6811].

   A peer receiving a prefix origin validation result from the route
   server MAY redistribute this information within its own AS.

   In cases where multiple ASes are being administered by the same
   authority, peers MAY also redistribute this information across EBGP
   boundaries of the authority in question.

5.2.  Validating Peers Receiving the EBGP Prefix Origin Validation State
      Extended Community

   A validating BGP speaker receiving routes from peers containing the
   EBGP Prefix Origin Validation State Extended Community MUST remove
   the extended community before the route is re-distributed to its
   peers.  This is required regardless of whether the validating BGP
   speaker is executing prefix origin validation or not.

   Failure to do so would allow opportunistic peers to advertise routes
   tagged with arbitrary prefix origin validation results via validating
   peers, influencing maliciously the decision process of other, non-
   validating BGP speakers.

5.3.  Information about Validity of a BGP Prefix Origin Not Available at
      a Validating Peer

   In case information about the validity of a BGP prefix origin is not
   available at the validating BGP speaker (e.g., error in the ROA
   cache, CPU overload) the validating BGP speaker MUST NOT add the EBGP
   Prefix Origin Validation State Extended Community to the route.

5.4.  Error Handling at Peers

   A route sent by a validating BGP speaker SHOULD only contain none or
   one EBGP Prefix Origin Validation State Extended Community.

   A peer receiving a route from a validating BGP speaker containing
   more than one EBGP Prefix Origin Validation State Extended Community
   SHOULD only consider the largest value (as described in Table 1) in
   the validation result field and disregard the other values.  Values
   larger than two in the validation result field MUST be disregarded.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to assign a transitive Four-octet AS Specific Extended
   Community Sub-Type as defined in Section 5.2.4 of [RFC7153].

7.  Security Considerations

   All security considerations described in RFC6811 [RFC6811] fully
   apply to this document.

   Additionally, threat agents polluting ROA cache server(s) run by AS
   operators could cause significant operational impact, since multiple
   validating BGP speaker clients could be affected.  Peers should be
   vigilant as to the integrity and authenticity of the origin
   validation results as they are provided by a third party, namely the
   AS operator hosting both the validating BGP speaker as well as any
   ROA cache server(s).

   Therefore, a validating BGP speaker could be misused to spread
   malicious prefix origin validation results.  However, in the case of
   IXPs, peers already trust the route server for the collection,
   filtering (e.g., IRR database filtering), and redistribution of BGP
   routing information to other peers.

   To facilitate trust and support with peers establishing appropriate
   controls in mitigating the risks mentioned above, AS operators SHOULD
   provide out-of-band means for peers to ensure that the ROA validation
   process has not been compromised or corrupted.

   While being under DDoS attacks, it is a common practice for peers
   connected to other Autonomous Systems and make use of blackholing
   services.  Peers are using blackholing to drop traffic, typically by
   announcing a more specific prefix, which is under attack.  A peer
   SHOULD ensure that this prefix is covered by an appropriate ROA.
