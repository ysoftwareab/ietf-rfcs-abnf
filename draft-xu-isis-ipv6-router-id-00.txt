1.  Introduction

   There are several situations where it is useful for the IS-IS routers
   in one area to establish the correlations between the IPv6 addresses
   and the capabilities of the other routers in another area.  However,
   in the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV as defined in [RFC4971], which is
   appliable for both IPv4 IS-IS [RFC1195] [RFC5305] and IPv6 IS-IS
   [RFC5308], only a 4-octet router ID is contained.  Therefore, this
   document propose a new sub-TLV of this CAPABILITY TLV to carry an
   16-octect router ID.  This 16-octect router ID MUST be a routable
   IPv6 global address of the router originating the CAPABILITY TLV.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC4971].

3.  IPv6 Router ID Sub-TLV

   A new sub-TLV of the IS-IS Router Capability TLV, called IPv6 Router
   ID sub-TLV is defined to carry a routable IPv6 global address of the
   router originating the CAPABILITY TLV.  The Type of this sub-TLV is
   TBD, the Length is set to 16, and the Value field contains an
   routable IPv6 global address of the router originating the CAPABILITY
   TLV.  The scope of the advertisement depends on the application but
   it is recommended that it SHOULD be domain-wide.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes a request to IANA to allocate a sub-TLV type
   within the IS-IS Router Capability TLV.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security risk.
