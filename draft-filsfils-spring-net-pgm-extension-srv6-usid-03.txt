Internet-DraftNetwork Programming extension: SRv6 uSID instFebruary 2020


1.  Introduction

   SRv6 Network Programming [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming]
   defines a mechanism to build a network program with topological and
   service segments.  It leverages the SRH
   [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header] to encode a network program
   together with optional metadata shared among the different SIDs.

   This draft extends SRv6 Network Programming with a new type of SRv6
   SID behavior: SRv6 uN.  This is combined with the rest of
   instructions of the network program and the SRH encapsulation to
   build programs in a scalable and efficient way.

2.  Terminology

   The SRv6 Network Programming
   [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming] and SRH
   [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header] terminology is leveraged and
   extended with the following terms:

   uSID carrier: a 128bit SRv6 SID of format <uSID-Block><Active-
   uSID><Next-uSID>...<Last-uSID><End-of-Carrier>...<End-of-Carrier>.  A
   uSID carrier can be encoded in the Destination Address of an IPv6
   header or at any position in the Segment List of an SRH.

   uSID block: A block of uSID's

      It can be any IPv6 prefix allocated to the provider (e.g. /40 or
      /48), or it can be any block generally available for private use
      (e.g. /16 or /32).  An SR domain may have multiple uSID blocks.

   uSID: in this document a 16-bit ID.  A different uSID length may be
   used.

   Active uSID: first uSID after the uSID block

   Next uSID: next uSID after the Active uSID

   Last uSID: from left to right, the last uSID before the first End-of-
   Carrier uSID

   End-of-Carrier: reserved ID used to mark the end of a uSID carrier.
   The value 0000 is selected as End-of-Carrier.  All of the empty uSID
   carrier positions must be filled with the End-of-Carrier ID.  Hence,
   the End-of-Carrier can be present more than once in a uSID carrier.

   Parent (node): the node at which an uSID is instantiated.  The uSIDs
   are instantiated on a per-parent node basis.

Internet-DraftNetwork Programming extension: SRv6 uSID instFebruary 2020


   Behavior of an uSID: the SRv6 function associated with a given ID.
   Section 3 defines them.

2.1.  Notation for human readability

   For human readability, the examples in this document follow this
   notation:

      2001:db8::/32 is the uSID block used in the SR domain

      0N00: uN behavior bound to node N

3.  SRv6 behaviors associated with a uSID

   The SRv6 SRH encapsulation and its network programming model are
   extended with the following functions:

3.1.  uN

   The uN behavior is a variant of the endpoint behavior.

   This behavior takes a 80b argument, "Arg", which contains the next
   uSIDs in the uSID carrier.

   When N receives a packet whose IPv6 DA is S and S is a local uN SID,
   N does:

   1.   IF DA[48..63] != 0                                       ;; Ref1
   2.      Copy DA[48..127] into DA[32..111]
   3.      Set DA[112..127] to 0x0000
   4.      Forward the packet to the new DA
   5.   ELSE
   6.      Execute the End pseudocode                            ;; Ref2

   Ref 1: DA[X..Y] refers to the bits from position X to Y (included) in
   the IPv6 Destination Address of the received packet.  The bit 0 is
   the MSB, while the bit 127 is the LSB.

   Ref 2: This refers to the End behavior as defined in Section 4.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming].  The End behavior may be
   combined with the PSP, USP and USD flavours.

4.  Routing

   If N is configured with a uN SID 2001:db8::/32 then the operator must
   ensure that N advertises 2001:db8::/32 in routing.

5.  Illustration

   This section extends the illustrations for SRv6 Network Programming
   [I-D.filsfils-spring-srv6-net-pgm-illustration] to cover uSID.  The
   reference topology is the same with the addition of link 6-8.

5.1.  Reference diagram

   Nodes 1 to 8 are considered within the network domain.

   Nodes X and Y are outside the domain.

   Nodes 1 and 8 act as PE respectively to nodes X and Y.

   All the links within the domain have the same IGP metric.  The IGP-
   metric shortest-path from 1 to 8 is 1-2-7-8 while the latency-metric
   shortest-path from 1 to 8 is 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8.

                                3------4---5
                                |       \ /
                                |        6
                                |       / \
                           1--- 2------7---8
                          /                 \
                         X                   Y

                                           IPv4 20/8

                       Figure 1: Reference topology

5.2.  SRv6 overlay with underlay optimization

   Let us illustrate a low-latency SR-L3VPN service delivered to a
   packet (X,Y).

   PE 1 encapsulates (X, Y) in an outer IPv6 header with DA =
   2001:db8:0300:0500:0700:: and SRH (B:8:D0::; SL=1; NH=4).  Leveraging
   the illustration conventions from SRv6 network programming, the
   following resulting packet leaves node 1 in the direction of node 3:

      (A1::, 2001:db8:0300:0500:0700::)(B:8:D0::; SL=1; NH=4)(X, Y)

   2001:db8:0300:0500:0700:: is a uSID carrier encoding a source routed
   stateless path via node 3 then 5 then 7.

   B:8:D0:: is an End.DT4 SID instantiated at node 8.

Internet-DraftNetwork Programming extension: SRv6 uSID instFebruary 2020


   1 sends this packet to 2, as 2 is on the shortest-path to
   2001:db8:0300::/48 advertised by 3.

   When 2 receives the packet, 2 performs a regular IPv6 FIB lookup.  It
   finds a FIB entry for 2001:db8:0300::/48 and forwards along the
   shortest path to 3.

   When 3 receives the packet, 3 matches 2001:db8:0300::/48 in its "My
   SID Table" and executes the uN behavior.  The updated DA becomes
   2001:db8:0500:0700::. Node 3 then performs a lookup on the updated DA
   and forwards the packet to 5 along the shortest path to
   2001:db8:0500::/48.

   The following packet leaves node 3:

      (A1::, 2001:db8:0500:0700::)(B:8:D0::; SL=1; NH=4)(X, Y)

   4 forwards along the shortest path to 2001:db8:0500::/48.

   When 5 receives the packet, 5 matches 2001:db8:0500::/48 in its "My
   SID Table" and executes the uN behavior.  The updated DA becomes
   2001:db8:0700::. 5 performs a lookup on the updated DA and forwards
   the packet to 7 along the shortest path to 2001:db8:0700::/48.

   The following packet leaves node 5:

      (A1::, 2001:db8:0700::)(B:8:D0::; SL=1; NH=4)(X, Y)

   6 forwards along the shortest path to 2001:db8:0700::/48.

   When 7 receives the packet, 7 matches 2001:db8:0700::/48 in its "My
   SID Table" and finds the bound function uN.  As a result, Node 7
   executes the "End with PSP and USD support" pseudocode, decrementing
   the SL value in the SRH, and updating the DA with the next SID
   B:8:D0::. Since the SL value is zero the SRH is removed.  Node 7
   performs a lookup on the updated DA and forwards along the shortest
   path.

   The following packet leaves node 7:

      (A1::, B:8:D0::)(X, Y)

   8 receives it, performs the End.DT4 function and sends the IP packet
   (X, Y) towards its VPN destination.

   This example illustrates the benefits highlighted in the next
   section.

6.  Benefits

      Perfect integration with SRv6 Network Programming

         SRv6 uSID is an instruction of the SRv6 network programming
         model

      Perfect integration with SRH

         Any SID in DA or SRH can be an SRv6 uSID carrier

      Scalable SR Policy

         6 uSID' per uSID carrier

         18 source routing waypoints in solely 40bytes of overhead

            T.Encaps.Red with an SRH of 40 bytes (8 fixed + 2 * 16
            bytes)

            6 uSID's in DA and 12 in SRH

      Efficient MTU overhead

         In apple to apple comparison, the SRv6 solution outperforms any
         alternative (VxLAN with SR-MPLS, CRH).

      Scalable number of globally unique nodes in the domain

         16-bit uSID: 65k uSIDs per domain block

         32-bit uSID: 4.3M uSIDs per domain block

      Hardware-friendly:

         Leverages mature hardware capabilities (shift)

         Avoids any extra lookup in indexed mapping table

         Demonstrated by Cisco linerate implementation on Jericho1

      Control-Plane friendly

         No indexed mapping table is required

         No routing extension is required: a simple prefix advertisement
         suffices
