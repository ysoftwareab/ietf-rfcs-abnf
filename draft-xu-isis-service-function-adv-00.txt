                 draft-xu-isis-service-function-adv-00

Abstract

   The Segment Routing mechanism can be leveraged to realize the service
   path layer functionality of the Service Function Chaining (i.e,
   steering traffic through the service function path).  This document
   describes how to advertise service functions and the corresponding
   segment IDs using IS-IS.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.xu-spring-sfc-use-case] describes a particular use case for
   SPRING where the Segment Routing (SR) mechanism is leveraged to
   realize the service path layer functionality of the Service Function
   Chaining (SFC), i.e, steering traffic through the service function
   path.  To allow the service classifier to encode the segment list
   represeting a particular service function path, the classifier needs
   to know on which service node(s) a given service function is located
   and what segment ID (SID) is used to indicate that service function
   on a given service node.  This document describes how to advertise
   service functions and their corresponding SIDs using IS-IS.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC4971].

3.  Advertising Service Functions and Corresponding SIDs

   Service nodes within the network need to advertise each service
   function they are offering by using a new sub-TLV of the IS-IS Router
   CAPABILITY TLV [RFC4971].  This new sub-TLV is called as Service
   Function sub-TLV.  The Service Function sub-TLV could appear multiple
   times wihin a given IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV when more than one
   service function needs to be advertised by a given service node.  The
   scope of the advertisement depends on the application but it is

   recommended that it SHOULD be domain-wide.  Furthermore, service
   nodes need to allocate a corresponding SID to each service function
   they are offering and advertise it by using a sub-TLV of the above
   Service Function sub-TLV, called Service Function SID sub-TLV.  In
   the MPLS-SR case, service nodes within the network would allocate a
   locally significant MPLS label to each service function they are
   offering.  In the IPv6-SR case, service nodes within the network
   would allocate a locally unique link-local IPv6 address to each
   service function they are offering.  For a given service function,
   the service node offering that service function could advertise the
   corresponding SID in the MPLS label format or in the IPv6 address
   format, or both.

      Type: TBD.

      Length: variable.

      Service Function Identifier: A unique identifier that represents a
      service function within an SFC-enabled domain.

      Sub-TLVs: contains zero or more sub-TLVs related to service
      functions.  Besides the Service Function SID sub-TLVs as defined
      in Section 3.2, other sub-TLVs (to be defined in future) which are
      used to describe some characters of a given service function could
      also be added.

      Type: TBD.

      Length: variable (3 or 16).

      Value: if the Length is set to 3, the 20 rightmost bits represent
      a MPLS label.  If the length is set to 16, the value represents an
      IPv6 address.

   TBD.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes a request to IANA to allocate one sub-TLV type
   codes within the IS-IS Router Capability TLV for the Service Function
   sub-TLV, and one sub-TLV type code within the Service Function sub-
   TLV for the Service Function SID sub-TLV.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security risk.
