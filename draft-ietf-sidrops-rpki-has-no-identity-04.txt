               The I in RPKI does not stand for Identity
               draft-ietf-sidrops-rpki-has-no-identity-04

Abstract

   There is a false notion that Internet Number Resources (INRs) in the
   RPKI can be associated with the real-world identity of the 'owner' of
   an INR.  This document attempts to put that notion to rest.

1.  Introduction

   The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), see [RFC6480],
   "Represents the allocation hierarchy of IP address space and
   Autonomous System (AS) numbers," which are collectively known as
   Internet Number Resources (INRs).  Since initial deployment, the RPKI
   has grown to include other similar resource and routing data, e.g.
   Router Keying for BGPsec, [RFC8635].

   In security terms, the phrase "Public Key" implies there is also a
   corresponding private key [RFC5280].  The RPKI's strong authority
   over ownership of INRs has misled some people toward a desire to use
   RPKI private keys to sign arbitrary documents attesting that the INR
   'owner' of those resources has attested to the authenticity of the
   document content.  But in reality, the RPKI certificate is only an
   authorization to speak for the explicitly identified INRs; it is
   explicitly not intended for authentication of the 'owners' of the
   INRs.  This situation is emphasized in Section 2.1 of [RFC6480].

   It has been suggested that one could authenticate real-world business
   transactions with the signatures of INR holders.  E.g.  Bill's Bait
   and Sushi could use their AS in the RPKI to sign a Letter of
   Authorization (LOA) for some other party to rack and stack hardware
   owned by BB&S.  Unfortunately, this is not formally feasible.

Internet-Draft  The I in RPKI does not stand for Identit      March 2022


   The I in RPKI actually stands for "Infrastructure," as in Resource
   Public Key Infrastructure, not for "Identity".  In fact, the RPKI
   does not provide any association between INRs and the real world
   holder(s) of those INRs.  The RPKI provides authorization to speak
   for the named IP address blocks and AS numbers.

   In short, avoid the desire to use RPKI certificates for any purpose
   other than the verification of authorizations associated with the
   delegation of INRs or attestations related to INRs.  Instead,
   recognize that these authorizations and attestations take place
   irrespective of the identity of a RPKI private key holder.

2.  The Bottom Line

   The RPKI was designed and specified to sign certificates for use
   within the RPKI itself and to generate Route Origin Authorizations
   (ROAs), [RFC6480], for use in routing.  Its design intentionally
   precluded use for attesting to real-world identity as, among other
   issues, it would expose the Certification Authority (CA) to
   liability.

   That the RPKI does not authenticate real-world identity is a feature,
   not a bug.  If it tried to do so, aside from the liability, it would
   end in a world of complexity with no proof of termination, as X.400
   learned.

   Registries such as the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) provide
   INR to real-world identity mapping through whois and similar
   services.  They claim to be authoritative, at least for the INRs
   which they allocate.

   RPKI-based credentials of INRs MUST NOT be used to authenticate real-
   world documents or transactions without some formal external
   authentication of the INR and the authority for the actually
   anonymous INR holder to authenticate the particular document or
   transaction.

   Given sufficient external, i.e. non-RPKI, verification of authority,
   the use of RPKI-based credentials seems superfluous.

3.  Discussion

   The RPKI base document, [RFC6480], Section 2.1 says explicitly "An
   important property of this PKI is that certificates do not attest to
   the identity of the subject."

Internet-Draft  The I in RPKI does not stand for Identit      March 2022


   The Template for a Certification Practice Statement (CPS) for the
   Resource PKI (RPKI) [RFC7382] Section 3.1, Naming, makes very clear
   that "The Subject name in each certificate SHOULD NOT be meaningful;"
   and goes on to do so at some length.

   Normally, the INR holder does not hold the private key attesting to
   their resources; the Certification Authority (CA) does.  The INR
   holder has a real-world business relationship with the CA for which
   they have likely signed real-world documents.

   As the INR owner does not have the keying material, they rely on the
   CA, to which they presumably present credentials, to manipulate their
   INRs.  These credentials may be userid/password (with two factor
   authentication one hopes), a hardware token, client browser
   certificates, etc.

   Hence schemes such as [I-D.ietf-sidrops-rpki-rta] and
   [I-D.ietf-sidrops-rpki-rsc] must go to great lengths to extract the
   supposedly relevant keys from the CA.

   For some particular INR, say Bill's Bait and Sushi's Autonomous
   System (AS) number, someone out on the net probably has the
   credentials to the CA account in which BB&S's INRs are registered.
   That could be the owner of BB&S, Roberto's Taco Stand, an IT vendor,
   or the Government of Elbonia.  One simply can not know.

   In large organizations, INR management is often compartmentalized
   with no authority over anything beyond dealing with INR registration.
   The INR manager for Bill's Bait and Sushi is unlikely to be
   authorized to conduct bank transactions for BB&S, or even to
   authorize access to BB&S's servers in some colocation facility.

   Then there is the temporal issue.  The owner of that AS may be BB&S
   today when some document was signed, and could be the Government of
   Elbonia tomorrow.  Or the resource could have been administratively
   moved from one CA to another, likely requiring a change of keys.  If
   so, how does one determine if the signature on the real-world
   document is still valid?

   While Ghostbuster Records [RFC6493] may seem to identify real-world
   entities, their semantic content is completely arbitrary, and does
   not attest to INR ownership.  They are merely clues for operational
   support contact in case of technical RPKI problems.

   Usually, before registering INRs, CAs require proof of INR ownership
   via external documentation and authorities.  It is somewhat droll
   that the CPS Template, [RFC7382], does not mention any diligence the
   CA must, or even might, conduct to assure the INRs are in fact owned
   by a registrant.

   That someone can provide 'proof of possession' of the private key
   signing over a particular INR should not be taken to imply that they
   are a valid legal representative of the organization in possession of
   that INR.  They could be just an INR administrative person.

   Autonomous System Numbers do not identify real-world entities.  They
   are identifiers some network operators 'own' and are only used for
   loop detection in routing.  They have no inherent semantics other
   than uniqueness.

4.  Security Considerations

   Attempts to use RPKI data to authenticate real-world documents or
   other artifacts requiring identity are invalid and misleading.

   When a document is signed with the private key associated with an
   RPKI certificate, the signer is speaking for the INRs, the IP address
   space and Autonomous System (AS) numbers, in the certificate.  This
   is not an identity; this is an authorization.  In schemes such as
   [I-D.ietf-sidrops-rpki-rta] and [I-D.ietf-sidrops-rpki-rsc] the
   signed message further narrows this scope of INRs.  The INRs in the
   message are a subset of the INRs in the certificate.  If the
   signature is valid, the message content comes from a party that is
   authorized to speak for that subset of INRs.

   Control of INRs for an entity could be used to falsely authorize
   transactions or documents for which the INR manager has no authority.

   RPKI-based credentials of INRs MUST NOT be used to authenticate real-
   world documents or transactions without some formal external
   authentication of the INR and the authority for the actually
   anonymous INR holder to authenticate the particular document or
   transaction.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA Considerations.
