Abstract

   This document describes the high-level functional requirements of an
   abstract format, the Format for Incident information Exchange (FINE),
   which will facilitate the exchange of incident information among
   computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs) and involved
   parties.  A common and well-defined format will help in the exchange
   of incident related information across organizations, regions, and
   countries.  Implementations of FINE will also be useful for
   reactionary analysis of current threats and support the proactive
   identification of trends that can lead to incident prevention.

Internet Draft                                         February 25, 2006


1. Introduction

   Computer security incidents occur across administrative domains,
   often spanning different organizations and national borders.  Hence,
   a response requires coordination and collaboration between the
   involved parties and the responsible computer security incident
   response teams (CSIRTs).  The basis for this interaction is often
   data and statistics describing the nature of the incident.  This
   information, referred to as an incident report in this document, will
   not only support response activity to the specific incident, but may
   also be used for historical analysis or proactive responses.

   This document defines the high-level functional requirements for a
   format that can support the exchange of incident reports. The
   abstract format being discussed is referred to as the Format for
   INcident information Exchange (FINE). The implementation of the
   requirements, the format itself, is out of the scope of this
   document.

   The intent of FINE is to enable rapid and effective response to
   incidents by improving the ability of  CSIRTs to exchange and process
   incident reports.  This will be achieved by ensuring that
   implementations of FINE require:
         +  unambiguous semantics for the data;
         +  a well-defined syntax for the data; and
         +  support end-user processing (e.g., categorization and
            statistical analysis).

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14, RFC 2119 [1].

2. Incident Handling Framework

2.1. Descriptive Terms
   For the purpose of clarity, certain commonly used terms from the
   operational domain of CSIRTs are defined here. These are based on
   related documents [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

2.1.1. Event
   An event is an occurrence in a system or network that may be of
   interest and warrant attention. An event is not necessarily malicious
   or deliberate.

2.1.2. Attack
   An attack is a series of events caused either directly or indirectly
   by a source that violates the security policy of the target.  These
   violations may include a compromise of a user account, denial of
   service, information theft, etc.

2.1.3. Source
   The origin of an attack as described by a host, user account,
   computer program, network address, person, or organization.

2.1.4. Target
   The target of an attack as described by a host, user account,
   computer program, network address, person, or organization.

2.1.5. Computer security incident
   A computer security incident, referred to as an incident, is a set of
   one or more related attacks identified by a CSIRT.

2.1.6. Incident report
   An incident report is the collection of information describing an
   incident.  In this document the terms "incident report" and "incident
   information" are used interchangeably.

2.1.7. CSIRT
   A computer security incident response team, CSIRT, is an individual
   or a group of individuals that has the responsibility to coordinate
   and support the response to incidents in a defined constituency [6].
   A CSIRT creates, receives, processes, and maintains incident reports.

2.1.8. Impact
   An impact describes the consequence of an incident on a target
   expressed in terms relevant to a user community.


2.2 The Operational Model

   Incident reports are an important subset of information exchanged
   between a CSIRT and its constituency or other CSIRTs. These reports
   form the basis for resolving and understanding activity in a
   constituency. A CSIRT may create an incident report when an incident
   is reported, receive a report from another CSIRT, or send a report to
   a CSIRT. As investigation into the incident progresses, new
   information about an incident may be discovered. New information may
   trigger subsequent information exchange.

   The creation and exchange of incident reports is often driven by a
   work-flow process that prioritizes and manages the information flow
   in a CSIRT.  These systems often associate CSIRT personnel with

   particular incidents or maintain status onto a given investigation.
   FINE does not provide a representation for these internal processes.

   FINE is a representation for the data exchanged between external
   parties. In order to integrate FINE into the operational processes of
   CSIRTS, the parties will have to use an interface to convert to and
   from the internal data representation (of a propriety work-flow
   application or database) and FINE. Hence, the sender of an incident
   report must convert from the local format to FINE, while the
   recipient must translate FINE back into its own local format.  The
   communicating CSIRTs need not have the same local format for storing
   incident reports.  This information exchange is depicted in Figure 1.

                   Fig. 1 Operational Model for FINE



3. General Requirements

3.1 FINE SHALL reference and use previously published RFCs where
   possible.

3.2 FINE MUST have well-defined semantics and specify a standard
   mechanism for extensibility.

   The data elements of the various components of FINE should be typed,
   and the meaning should be well specified.  Likewise, there should be
   a standardized method to address representing data not defined in the
   data model.

Internet Draft                                         February 25, 2006


4. Format Requirements

4.1 FINE SHALL support full internationalization and localization.

   A significant part of the incident report may consist of natural
   language text. Since some incidents may involve CSIRTs from different
   countries, FINE must have provisions for using local character sets
   and encodings.

   In cases where local (non-standard) character sets and encodings are
   used, the data elements that carry encoding-sensitive information
   should be clearly indicated.

4.2 FINE MUST allow multilingual reports.

   Different parts of the incident report may be written in a different
   natural language.  FINE must support multiple translations of the
   same data element.

4.3 FINE MUST support aggregation and filtering of incident report data.

   The structure of the FINE data elements and their associated
   semantics must lend themselves to aggregation and filtering by
   applications.


4.4 FINE MUST be able to document the evolution of an incident.

   An incident report may evolve with time as further investigation is
   carried out on the incident.  Earlier information may be modified and
   new information added.  FINE must support the documentation of these
   changes.

4.5 FINE MUST support specifying a granular access restriction policy
   on subsets of the incident report.

   Different parts of an incident report may have information of varying
   degrees of sensitivity. It must be possible to label subsets of the
   incident report with their appropriate sensitivity.  With this
   information, applications can then implement different levels of
   access restrictions for the different components of the incident
   report.

4.6 FINE SHOULD allow the application of external mechanisms to
   support authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation checks of
   incident reports.

   FINE itself need not guarantee authenticity, integrity, or non-

   repudiation. However, the specification must detail a standardized
   mechanism to ensure these properties.



5. Communication Mechanism Requirements

5.1 The security properties of FINE reports SHOULD be
    independent of the communication mechanism.

   The exchange of incident reports is typically conducted using
   standard communication protocols (e.g., SMTP, HTTP, FTP, XML Web
   Services). The security properties of FINE MUST NOT be tied to a
   particular communications protocol. Provisions for authenticity,
   integrity, and confidentiality should be made in FINE.


6. Content Requirements

6.1 FINE MUST be flexible enough to support various degrees of
   completeness, while still clearly defining the minimal
   information required for describing an incident.

6.2 FINE MUST support globally unique identifiers for each incident
   report.

   It should be possible to reference an incident report unambiguously
   using a globally unique identifier. Furthermore, it should be
   possible to derive the constituency of the incident report from this
   identifier.

6.3 FINE MUST support the naming of the source and target.

6.4 FINE MUST support the description of various aspects of the
   source and target.

6.5 FINE MUST support the description of the methodology used by
   the attacker.

   Well-known classifications or enumeration schemes should be used to
   describe the attack.

6.6 FINE SHOULD support the identification of the creator of the
    incident report.

   FINE should indicate the source of each component of the incident
   report if it is different from the creator (e.g., the team handling
   the incident).

Internet Draft                                         February 25, 2006


6.7 FINE SHOULD support the inclusion or referencing of information
   external to the incident report.

6.8 FINE MUST support natural language descriptions of the incident.

6.9 FINE SHOULD support references to the appropriate advisories
   from coordination and analysis centers.

6.10 FINE SHOULD support a description of the impact of the incident.

6.11 FINE SHOULD support a description of the actions taken during the
   course of handling the incident.

6.12 FINE MUST use a standardized time specification.

   Incident reports should represent time in such a way that it is
   possible to easily compare information reported from different time
   zones.


7. Security Considerations


   There are no explicit security considerations for this document,
   since no protocol or information model is specified.  However, a
   number of security relevant requirements are outlined for FINE
   implementers.  By its nature, FINE will represent sensitive
   information.  Hence, implementers should ensure support for access
   restriction (requirement 4.5), confidentiality, integrity, and non-
   repudiation (requirement 4.6) all through transport independent
   approaches (requirement 5.1).

8. IANA Considerations

   This document requires no action from IANA.
