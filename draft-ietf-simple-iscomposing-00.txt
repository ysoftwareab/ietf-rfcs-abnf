Abstract

   In instant messaging systems, it is useful to know that the other
   party is composing a message, e.g., typing. This document defines a
   new content type and XML namespace that conveys information about a
   message being composed. The message could be of any type, including
   text, voice or video.

Internet-Draft                iscomposing                     March 2004


1.  Introduction

   By definition, instant messaging is message-based, i.e., a user
   composes a message by typing, speaking or recording a video clip.
   This message is then sent.  Unlike email, instant messaging is often
   conversational, so that the other party is waiting for a response.
   If no response is forthcoming, an IM session participant may
   erroneously assume that either the communication partner has left or
   that it is her turn to type again, leading to messaging "crossing on
   the wire".

   To avoid this uncertainty, a number of commercial instant messaging
   systems feature an "is-typing" indication that is set as soon as one
   party starts typing a message.  In this document, we describe a
   generalized version of this indication.  A status message is
   delivered to the IM recipient in the same manner as the messages
   themselves.  The is-composing messages can announce the composition
   of any media type, not just text.  For example, it might be used if
   somebody is recording an audio or video clip.  In addition, it can be
   extended to convey other IM user states in the future.

   This indication can be considered somewhat analogous to the comfort
   noise packets that are transmitted in silence-suppressed interactive
   voice conversations.

      Events and extensions to presence, such as PIDF
      [I-D.ietf-impp-cpim-pidf], were also considered, but have a number
      of disadvantages.  They add more overhead, since an explicit and
      periodic subscription is required.  For page-mode delivery,
      subscribing to the right user agent and set of messages may not be
      easy. An in-band, message-based mechanism is also easier to
      gateway into non-SIP systems.

   The mechanism described here aims to satisfy the requirements in
   [I-D.rosenberg-simple-messaging-requirements].

2.  Terminology and Conventions

   This memo makes use of the vocabulary defined in the IMPP Model
   document [RFC2778].  Terms such as CLOSED, INSTANT MESSAGE, OPEN,
   PRESENCE SERVICE, PRESENTITY, WATCHER, and WATCHER USER AGENT in the
   memo are used in the same meaning as defined therein.  The key words
   MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and
   OPTIONAL in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   XX, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Description

   We model user behavior as states, initially limited to Idle and
   Active.  When the user first starts composing, the state becomes
   Active and an isComposing message containing a <state> element
   indicating "active" is sent.  As long as the user produces message
   content, the user remains in state Active.  The composing user MAY
   specify a time-out interval measured in seconds, using the <timeout>
   element, after which the isComposing message is resent to refresh the
   state.  The refresh period SHOULD be no shorter than 60 seconds.  If
   the <timeout> element is omitted, the receiver should assume that no
   refresh messages will be sent.  Receivers MUST be able to handle
   multiple isComposing messages with "active" state regardless of the
   refresh interval.

      The refresh mechanism deals with the case that the user logs off
      or the application crashes before the message is completed.

   If the user stops composing for more than a configured time interval,
   the idle timeout, the state transitions to Idle and an "idle" message
   is sent.  When the user starts composing again while in Idle state,
   the state transitions to Active, with the corresponding message.

   The idle timeout SHOULD be ten seconds.

   If an instant message is sent before the idle threshold expires, no
   idle state indication is needed.  Thus, in most cases, only one
   message is needed.  The message rate is limited to one message per
   idle threshold interval.

   The optional <lastactivity> element describes the absolute time when
   the user last added or edited content.

   The optional <contenttype> element indicates what type of media the
   IM terminal is currently composing.  It can contain either just a
   MIME media type, such as "audio" or "text", or a media type and
   subtype, such as "text/html".

   The XML schema can be extended in the future.  Recipients of messages
   implementing this specification MUST treat state tokens other than
   "idle" and "active" as "idle".

   The isComposing indicator MAY be carried in CPIM messages
   [I-D.ietf-impp-cpim-msgfmt].

      Such a wrapper is particularly useful if messages are relayed by a
      conference server since the CPIM message maintains the identity of
      the original composer.

4.  Using the Indicator

   The is-composing indicator can be used with either SIP page mode or
   session mode, although it is a more natural fit with session mode.
   In session mode, the indicator is sent as part of the messaging
   stream. Its usage is negotiated just like support for any other media
   type in a stream is negotiated, i.e., through SDP.  Sending the
   indicators within the messaging stream has many benefits.  First, it
   ensures proper sequencing and synchronization with the actual
   messages being composed. Secondly, end-to-end security can be applied
   to the messages.  Thirdly, SDP negotiation mechanisms can be used to
   turn it on and off at any time, and even negotiate its use in a
   single direction at a time.

   Usage with the page mode is also straightforward. The indicator would
   be carried as the body of a page mode message. Unfortunately, there
   is no way to negotiate its usage, turn it on or off, or even be sure
   that the indicator gets delivered before the actual content being
   composed.

     <isComposing xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:sip-iscomposing"
       <state>active</state>

       <timeout>90</timeout>
       <lastactivity>2003-01-27T10:43:00Z</lastactivity>
     </isComposing>


   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
     <isComposing xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:sip-iscomposing"
       <state>idle</state>
       <contenttype>audio</contenttype>
       <lastactivity>2003-01-27T10:43:00Z</lastactivity>
     </isComposing>

7.  Security Considerations

   The is-composing indication provides a fine-grained view of the
   activity of the entity composing and thus deserves particularly
   careful confidentiality protection so that only the intended
   destination of the message will receive the is-composing indication.
