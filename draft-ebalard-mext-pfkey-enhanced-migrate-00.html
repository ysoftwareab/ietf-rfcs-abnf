<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p> This document describes the need for an interface between
      Mobile IPv6 and IPsec/IKE and show how the two protocols can
      interwork. An extension of the PF_KEY framework is proposed
      which allows smooth and solid operation of IKE in a Mobile IPv6
      environment.
</p>
<p> This document is heavily based on a previous draft [MIGRATE]
      written by Shinta Sugimoto, Masahide Nakamura and Francis
      Dupont. It simply reuses the MIGRATE mechanism defined in the 
      expired document, removes a companion extension
      (SADB_X_EXT_PACKET) based on implementation feedback
      (complexity, limitations, ...) and fills the gap by very simple
      changes to MIGRATE mechanism. This results in a more simple and
      consistent mechanism, which also proved to be easier to
      implement. This document is expected to serve as a continuation
      of [MIGRATE] work. For that reason, the name of the extension
      has been kept.
</p>
<p> PF_KEY MIGRATE message serves as a carrier for updated
      address information for both the in-kernel IPsec structures
      (SP/SA) and those maintained by the key managers. This includes
      in-kernel SP/SA endpoints, key manager maintained equivalents
      and addresses used by IKE_SA (current and to be negotiated). The
      extension is helpful for assuring smooth internetworking between
      Mobile IPv6 and IPsec/IKE for the bootstrapping of mobile nodes 
      and their movements.

<a name="rfc.section.1"></a><h3>1.&nbsp;
Introduction</h3>

<p>In <a class='info' href='#RFC3775'>Mobile IPv6<span> (</span><span class='info'>Johnson, D., Perkins, C., and J. Arkko, &ldquo;Mobility Support in IPv6,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3775], the Mobile Node
      (MN) and the Home Agent (HA) use some IPsec Security
      Associations (SAs) in tunnel mode to protect some mobility 
      signaling messages, mobile prefix discovery and optionally
      payload traffic.  Since the MN may change its attachment point
      to the Internet, it is necessary for it to update the tunnel
      endpoint address of its IPsec SAs.  This indicates that
      corresponding entries in IPsec databases (Security Policy (SPD)
      and SA (SAD) databases) should be updated when MN performs movements.
</p>
<p>In a Mobile IPv6 environment, a key manager also needs to be
      notified when the SPD and SAD are updated. More generally, it
      needs to be provided with updated addresses for already
      negotiated and future IKE_SA. Because of its role and unlike
      common applications, key managers have to take part to the
      mobility process they secure: they need to be aware of address
      changes.
</p>
<p>This document describes the need for an interface between
      Mobile IPv6 and IPsec/IKE and shows how the two protocols can
      interwork. An extension to the <a class='info' href='#RFC2367'>PF_KEY
      framework<span> (</span><span class='info'>McDonald, D., Metz, C., and B. Phan, &ldquo;PF_KEY Key Management API, Version 2,&rdquo; July&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2367] which allows smooth and solid operation of IKE
      in a Mobile IPv6 environment is defined in the document. The
      extension is called PF_KEY MIGRATE and serves as a carrier for
      the necessary information for both the in-kernel IPsec stack and
      the key managers.
</p>
<p>For the IPsec stack, this allows migrating the endpoint
      addresses of the IPsec SAs (and associated SP). For the key
      managers, this allows the mirrored structures to be updated (SAD
      and SPD). This also allows the addresses of already negotiated
      and associated IKE_SA to be migrated, and to make specific
      addresses available for negotiations of future IKE_SA. This set
      of operations performed by the KM on its internal structures is
      initiated by the MIPv6 process.
</p>
<p>With the extension, the bootstrapping of the MN appears as a
      common operation for IKE, by having the right addresses needed
      for the negotiation available prior to the reception of the
      ACQUIRE message.
</p>
<p>The extension is helpful for assuring smooth interworking
      between Mobile IPv6 and IPsec/IKE and achieving performance
      optimization.
</p>
<p> As stated in the abstract, this document is heavily based on
      the content of a previous
      draft <a class='info' href='#MIGRATE'>MIGRATE<span> (</span><span class='info'>Sugimoto, S., Nakamura, M., and F. Dupont, &ldquo;PF_KEY Extension as an Interface between Mobile IPv6 and IPsec/IKE,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> [MIGRATE].
      This expired memo served as the basis for this work both from
      technical and editorial standpoints. Numerous technical
      discussions with some of its authors took place while working on
      this memo.

<a name="rfc.section.2"></a><h3>2.&nbsp;
Terminology</h3>

<p> In this document, the term IKE implicitly stands for both
      IKEv1 <a class='info' href='#RFC2409'>[RFC2409]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Harkins, D. and D. Carrel, &ldquo;The Internet Key Exchange (IKE),&rdquo; November&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> and IKEv2
      <a class='info' href='#RFC4306'>[RFC4306]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kaufman, C., &ldquo;Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) Protocol,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>. IKEv2 terminology is used
      preferentially when describing actions performed by the key
      manager but they also apply to the IKEv1 counterparts. For
      instance, when actions occur on IKE_SA, they also apply to Phase
      1 for IKEv1, except otherwise specified. Key manager is used as
      a more generic term in the memo to refer to the IKE daemon.

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
Needs for Interactions between Mobile IPv6 and IPsec/IKE</h3>

<p> The section 4.4 of <a class='info' href='#RFC3776'>RFC 3776<span> (</span><span class='info'>Arkko, J., Devarapalli, V., and F. Dupont, &ldquo;Using IPsec to Protect Mobile IPv6 Signaling Between 	  Mobile Nodes and Home Agents,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3776]
      specifies the rules which apply to IKE for MNs and HAs. The
      first requirement is to run IKE over the Care-of Address (CoA)
      because the Home Address (HoA) is usable only after the home
      registration but not yet in the bootstrapping phase, when
      Transport mode IPsec SA are commonly negotiated to protect
      BU/BA.
</p>
<p> A tunnel IPsec SA pair protects some signaling messages and
      optionally all the traffic between the MN and HA.  The initial
      SPD entry uses the HoA for the MN endpoint address and updates
      this address to the new CoA at each movement.  A tunnel SA pair
      is created on demand and is updated too. The <a class='info' href='#RFC3775'>RFC 3775<span> (</span><span class='info'>Johnson, D., Perkins, C., and J. Arkko, &ldquo;Mobility Support in IPv6,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3775] assumes there is an API which
      performs the update in the SPD and SAD on both the MN and HA,
      and notify the IKE daemon. This document is mainly about this
      API.
</p>
<p> Mobile IPv6 may need to make an access to the SPD not only
      for updating an endpoint address but also for deleting/inserting
      a specific SPD entry. When the MN performs Foreign-to-Home
      movement, IPsec SAs established between the MN and HA should be
      deleted, which means that the SPD entry should have no effect
      anymore. On the other hand, when the MN performs Home-to-Foreign
      movement, the IPsec SAs should be restored. Hence security
      policy entries that are associated with tunnel mode SAs may
      dynamically be added/removed (enabled/disabled) in along with
      MN's movements.
</p>
<p> It should be noted that <a class='info' href='#RFC3963'>NEMO Basic
      Support<span> (</span><span class='info'>Devarapalli, V., Wakikawa, R., Petrescu, A., and P. Thubert, &ldquo;Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Support Protocol,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3963] has similar requirements for the Mobile Router
      (MR) and MR's HA (MRHA).  In NEMO, the MR works just like a MN
      registering its location information to the MRHA and establishes
      a tunnel (IP-in-IP or IPsec tunnel).  When an IPsec tunnel is
      established between MR and MRHA, the MR serves as a Security
      Gateway for the nodes connected to the mobile network. The MR is
      responsible for handling its tunnel endpoint properly.

Requirements</h3>

<p> Despite the need for an interface between Mobile IPv6 and
      IPsec/IKE, it should be kept simple. Following are the
      requirements for the interface from a software engineering point
      of view.<br />
<br />


      </p>
<ul class="text">
<li> Necessary modifications to the existing software, namely
        Mobile IPv6 and IPsec/IKE, in order to realize proposed
        mechanisms, should be kept minimum.
</li>
<li> Proposed mechanism should not be platform dependent. The
        mechanism should be based on technology which is commonly
        available on various platform. This seems to be essential for
        achieving high portability of the implementation which
        supports proposed mechanisms.

PF_KEY Extensions for Mobile IPv6: PF_KEY MIGRATE Message</h3>

<p> In order to fulfill the needs and requirements described in
      <a class='info' href='#needs'>Section&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Needs for Interactions between Mobile IPv6 and IPsec/IKE</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#requirements'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Requirements</span><span>)</span></a> we
      propose to extend the PF_KEY framework so that Mobile IPv6 and
      IPsec/IKE can interact with each other. The new message
      dedicated to that function is called MIGRATE. A new simple PF_KEY
      structure (sadb_x_kmaddress) is also defined to be used by
      MIGRATE to serve the purpose of IKE_SA update.

System Overview</h3>

<p> The MIGRATE message is used for providing
          updated information to its two targets, the kernel IPsec
          stack and the key manager (when used). The figure below
          illustrates how Mobile IPv6 and IPsec/IKE components
          interact with each other using PF_KEY MIGRATE message in a
          dynamic keying scenario. On left top is a Mobile IPv6 entity
          (it may be possible that Mobile IPv6 component is completely
          implemented inside the kernel). In any case, Mobile IPv6
          should be the one which issues the MIGRATE message. On right
          top is an IKE daemon which is responsible for establishing
          SAs required for Mobile IPv6 operation. In a manual keying
          scenario, the difference is mainly that there is no IKE
          daemon running on the system.

<p> In the kernel, the primary role of PF_KEY MIGRATE
          message is to migrate endpoint addresses of SA pairs, which
          results in requesting IPsec to update its databases (SPD and
          SAD). Even if tunnel mode is the primary target for MIPv6,
          MIGRATE is not limited to that mode (See <a class='info' href='#applicability'>Section&nbsp;5.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Applicability of PF_KEY MIGRATE to Other Systems</span><span>)</span></a>). Then, after proper processing by
          the kernel, the MIGRATE message is sent to all open
          sockets. A listening key manager processes it, which results
          in a possible update of its internal structures. The
          specific actions are introduced on the following
          figure.

</pre></div>
<p> In more details, the processing of a MIGRATE message is
          done in following steps:<br />
<br />


	    </p>
<ul class="text">
<li> Mobile IPv6 issues a PF_KEY MIGRATE message to the
	      PF_KEY socket. 
</li>
<li> The operating system (kernel) validates the message
              and checks if corresponding security policy entry exists
              in SPD. 
</li>
<li> When the message is confirmed to be valid, the SPD
              entry is updated according to the MIGRATE message. If
              there is any target SA found that is also target of the
              update, it should also be updated. 
</li>
<li> After the MIGRATE has beensuccessfully processed
              inside the kernel, it is sent to all open PF_KEY
              sockets. 
</li>
<li> The IKE daemon receives the MIGRATE message from its
              PF_KEY socket and validates it. 
</li>
<li> The key manager starts by updating the SP entries
              described in the message with the updated endpoint
              information. It also updates in its SPD image the local
              and remote addresses to be used for future negotiation
              of SA associated with those SP (addresses used by future
              IKE_SA). Then, it updates the SA related information:
              the endpoints of already negotiated SA and the local and
              remote values of associated IKE_SA. 
</li>
</ul><p>
	  
</p>
<p> Note that the way IKE maintains its local copy of SPD
          (the SPD image) is an implementation specific issue since
          there is no standard interface to access SPD. Some IKE
          implementations may continuously monitor the SPD inside the
          kernel. Some IKE implementation may expect notifications from
          the kernel when the SPD is modified. In  either way, the
          proposed mechanism gives a chance for IKE to keep its SPD
          image up-to-date which is significant in Mobile IPv6
          operation.

<a name="rfc.section.5.1.2"></a><h3>5.1.2.&nbsp;
Bootstrapping</h3>

<p> In the bootstrapping stage of Mobile IPv6, the MN and the
        HA need to establish IPsec SA to protect signaling messages of
        Mobile IPv6 such as BU and BA. When IKE is used to establish
        and maintain the SA pairs, the IKE negotiation is the very
        first transaction made between the MN and the HA. 
</p>
<p> As mentioned in <a class='info' href='#RFC3776'>[RFC3776]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Arkko, J., Devarapalli, V., and F. Dupont, &ldquo;Using IPsec to Protect Mobile IPv6 Signaling Between 	  Mobile Nodes and Home Agents,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>, some care is
        needed for the address management of the IKE negotiation in
        Mobile IPv6 environments. In particular, IKE negotiation to be
        made to establish a transport mode IPsec SA pair is tricky
        because the local IKE_SA address and the SA endpoint on the MN
        side (the Home Address) are different. This is because the
        home address cannot be used prior to the initial home
        registration. Even if the SADB_X_EXT_KMADDRESS extension
        defined in this memo enables the MIPv6 module to notify
        the IKE module about the IKE endpoint, address selection is
        left outside the scope of the document. In practice, a
        suitable candidate for the IKE endpoint is the primary
        CoA.
</p>
<p> A simple solution to have the key manager be aware that a
        different address must be used for the negotiation of SA is to
        have it record this address within its mirrored SPD entries as
        soon as it becomes available. With that information, it is
        able to inflect its usual processing where it selects by default
        the source address of the SA for the negotiation (i.e. as
        local address of the IKE_SA). By having the MIGRATE message
        emitted by the Mobile IPv6 process before the emission of the
        BU, the address is already available to the key manager when
        the ACQUIRE message is received. 
</p>
<p> Even if the bootstrapping process initially appears
        differently than the usual process, having the internal
        structure of the key manager explicitly record the address (to
        be used for the negotiation of the SA for a specific SP)
        allows to keep things simple. The only requirement is that the
        MIGRATE message be emitted by the Mobile IPv6 process before
        it sends its Binding Update.

<a name="rfc.section.5.1.3"></a><h3>5.1.3.&nbsp;
Movement</h3>

<p> Next, we will see how migration takes place in along with
        home registration. The figure below shows sequence of mobility
        signaling and PF_KEY MIGRATE messages while the MN roams
        around links. It is assumed that in the initial state the
        tunnel endpoint address for a given MN is set as its home
        address. In the initial home registration, the MN and HA
        migrate the tunnel endpoint address from the HoA to CoA1. It
        should be noted that no migration takes place when the MN
        performs re-registration since the care-of address remains the
        same. Accordingly, the MN performs movement and changes its
        primary care-of address from CoA1 to CoA2. A PF_KEY MIGRATE
        message is issued on both MN and HA for each direction.  When
        the MN returns to home, migration takes place updating the
        endpoint address with the MN's home address. 
</p>
<p> With regard to the timing of issuing the MIGRATE message
        on the MN side during a handover, it must occur immediately
        before the emission of the binding update performing the home
        registration (as for bootstrapping). It is possible that
        ESP-protected (IPsec tunneled) user traffic be sent from the
        new CoA which is not known to the HA yet. As the HA processes
        the packets under IPsec, and as far as it finds a valid SA,
        then those packets will be authenticated regardless of their
        source IP address. In the end, there is no security issue in
        updating the IPsec SA endpoint while sending the BU and no
        reason not to do it. Furthermore, this may help the MN to
        minimize the packet loss of its outbound traffic during the
        handover.

<p> Key manager address information content (source and
        destination address) is recorded in the associated entry of
        the SPD image. Those are used from now on by the key manager
        for SA negotiation associated with that SP. The information is
        also used by the key manager to update the local and remote
        addresses of the IKE_SA (used by already negotiated SA
        associated with the SP). 
</p>
<p> Selector information is required for specifying the target
        SPD entry to be updated. Basically the information should
        contain necessary elements which characterize traffic selector
        as specified in the IPsec architecture
        (<a class='info' href='#RFC2401'>[RFC2401]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kent, S. and R.

        is not fully aware of IPsec configuration, a wildcard value
        could be given. In such case, an upper layer protocol

        entry. Plus, the direction of the security policy
        (inbound/outbound) should be provided.

        addresses that appear in the IP header, and those should be
        provided by the MIGRATE message. For transport mode, we
        require it to be present to keep a fixed message format. For
        all modes, the address information represents the locators of
        the SA. For transport mode, it must match with the addresses
        provided in the selector. For tunnel mode, it is obviously not
        required. 
</p>
<p> The source and destination addresses (locators) of the
	target entry should be overwritten. New locator values should
	also be used to update SP. Note that the IPsec protocol and
	mode fields should not be updated by a PF_KEY MIGRATE
	message. 
</p>
<p> A PF_KEY MIGRATE message should be formed, based on
        security policy configuration and binding record.  The
        selector information and some parts of the SA information
        (IPsec protocol and mode) should be taken from the policy
        configuration. The rest of the information should be taken
        from the sequential binding information. For example, in the
        case where the MN updates its inbound security policy and
        corresponding tunnel mode SA pair, the old source address
        should be set as its previous CoA, and the new source address
        should be set as its current CoA. Hence, the MN should
        sequentially keep track of its CoA record. Such information
        shall be stored in binding update list entry. For the same
        reason, the HA should keep track of previous CoAs of MNs. Such
        information shall be stored in binding cache entry. In
        previous scenario, the source and destination entries of the
        address information for the key manager should respectively be
        set to the CoA and the address of the HA. 
</p>
<p> A detailed format of MIGRATE message is provided in
	Appendix A.

Processing PF_KEY MIGRATE Message</h3>

<p> Since a PF_KEY MIGRATE message is applied to a single SPD
        entry, the kernel should first check validity of the
        message. During that process, it simply skips sadb_x_kmaddress
        structure content. If the message is invalid, an EINVAL error
        MUST be returned as a return value for the write() operation
        made to the PF_KEY socket.  After the validation, the kernel
        checks if the target SPD entry really exists. If no entry  is
        found, an ENOENT error MUST be returned. If a SPD entry is
        found and successfully updated, a success (0) MUST be returned
        regardless of subsequent result of SAD lookup/update. Note
        that there may be cases where a corresponding SAD entry does
        not exist even if a SPD entry is successfully updated. In any
        error case, a PF_KEY MIGRATE message MUST NOT have any effect
        on the SPD and SAD. 
</p>
<p> With respect to the behavior of a normal process
        (including the IKE daemon) which receives a PF_KEY MIGRATE
        message from a PF_KEY socket, it SHOULD first check if the
        message does not include erroneous information.  When there is
        any error indicated, the process MUST silently discard the
        PF_KEY MIGRATE message. Otherwise, the processing of the
        message may continue. This implies that the kernel is the only
        entity responsible for returning a status regarding message
        validation.

Applicability of PF_KEY MIGRATE to Other Systems</h3>

<p> The PF_KEY MIGRATE extension can also be applied to other
        systems than Mobile IPv6.  In some systems, there is a need to
        update endpoint address of IPsec security association for
        various reasons such as mobility management and multihoming. 
</p>
<p> In a Mobile VPN scenario (aka "road warrior"), client node
        roams around different IP subnets while maintaining security
        associations with the security gateway.  Just like in Mobile
        IPv6 case, both of the IKE peers need to update the endpoint
        of the IPsec tunnel and PF_KEY MIGRATE message can be used for
        that purpose. 
</p>
<p> In HIP mobility management scenario
        <a class='info' href='#RFC5206'>[RFC5206]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nikander, P., Henderson, T., Vogt, C., and J. Arkko, &ldquo;End-Host Mobility and Multihoming with the Host Identity Protocol,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>, a mobile host can maintain a
        HIP association with its peer while moving around IP subnets.
        When the mobile host changes its attachment point to the
        Internet, it sends an UPDATE message to the peer reporting its
        new locator. Since HIP association is represented by an IPsec
        security association of ESP BEET mode, the same mechanism can
        be applied for the purpose of updating endpoint.  The
        procedure of MIGRATE can take place when the mobile host
        detects movement and when the peer receives the UPDATE
        message. 
</p>
<p> From the ID/Locator separation point of view, PF_KEY
        MIGRATE is designed to update locators stored in an IPsec
        security association. Even if this usually applies to IPsec
        security associations in tunnel mode, the MIGRATE framework
        also covers the transport mode. For instance, there are
        exceptional cases where IPsec security associations are
        bundled.  In some case, a transport mode security association
        may be bundled with a tunnel mode security association.  For
        instance, a combination of AH (transport mode) and ESP (tunnel
        mode) may assure confidentiality of the payload as well as
        data integritiy of the whole IP packet including outer header.
        In such case, PF_KEY MIGRATE message may be used for updating
        endpoint addresses of IPsec transport mode.

NAT Traversal</h3>

<p> Dual Stack Mobile IPv6
	<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-mext-nemo-v4traversal'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;mext&#8209;nemo&#8209;v4traversal]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Soliman, H., &ldquo;Mobile IPv6 support for dual stack Hosts and Routers (DSMIPv6),&rdquo; July&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> supports a
	scenario where a MN is connected to a network behind a Network
	Address Translator (NAT).  In such case, the MN assigns a IPv4
	private address to its network interface but it is still
	capable of registering its care-of address to the HA, using
	the NAT Traversal technique <a class='info' href='#RFC3948'>[RFC3948]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Huttunen, A., Swander, B., Volpe, V., DiBurro, L., and M. Stenberg, &ldquo;UDP Encapsulation of IPsec ESP Packets,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>. The MN
	and HA leverage an IPsec tunnel to protect the return
	routability messages. 
</p>
<p> It is possible for the PF_KEY MIGRATE message to handle
        IPv4 private address when the MN is behind a NAT device.  In a
        NAT Traversal case, the endpoint address of the MN is
        characterized by the IP address and the pair of source and
        destination port numbers used for the UDP encapsulation.
        Therefore, in a NAT Traversal scenario, a Mobile IPv6 module
        MUST issue a PF_KEY MIGRATE message along with the pair of
        source and destination port numbers of a UDP encpasulation, to
        handle IPv4 private address.

<a name="rfc.section.5.6"></a><h3>5.6.&nbsp;
Limitations of PF_KEY MIGRATE</h3>

<p> Currently, a Security Parameter Index (SPI) is not
        included in the old SA information to specify target SAD
        entry.  This helps to lessen operational burden of Mobile
        IPv6.  However, this simplification can produce ambiguity in
        searching for the target security association entry.  When the
        unique SPD level is available, it should be used because it
        avoids this problem both by marking the SAs to update and by
        limiting SA sharing.
</p>
<p> It should be noted that delivery of PF_KEY MIGRATE
        messages cannot be guaranteed, which is common to other PF_KEY
        messages. It may be possible (even if highly unlikely) that a
        MIGRATE message be lost. In such case, there will be
        inconsistency between the binding record managed by Mobile
        IPv6 and IPsec database inside the kernel or the IKE
        daemon. 

	Once a PF_KEY MIGRATE message is lost, it would not be
        possible for the receiver to process some subsequent MIGRATE
        messages properly. Reinitialization of the Mobile IPv6 stack
        and IPsec databases may be needed for recovery.

Necessary Modifications to Mobile IPv6 and IPsec/IKE</h3>

<br />


	</p>
<ul class="text">
<li> Modifications to Mobile IPv6:
	    
<ul class="text">
<li> The Mobile IPv6 code needs to make an access to

		socket. 
</li>
<li> Issuing PF_KEY MIGRATE messages: in order to send
                MIGRATE messages, it is required that the Mobile IPv6
                code has some knowledge of its IPsec configuration and
                precise binding record. The Mobile IPv6 code may be
                aware of exact IPsec configuration in form of security
                policy. It would also be possible that the Mobile IPv6
                code is only aware of minimum IPsec configuration
                whether IPsec is utilized or not. 
</li>
<li> With regard to the emission of the MIGRATE message
		during the home registration, the Mobile IPv6 code
		need to emit it before issuing the Binding
		Update. 
</li>

</li>
<li> Modifications to IPsec: 
	    
<ul class="text">
<li> Processing PF_KEY MIGRATE messages: the kernel

<ul class="text">
<li> There is a need for Mobile IPv6 and IPsec/IKE to interact

<li> An extension to the PF_KEY framework (PF_KEY MIGRATE
	  message) is proposed, which makes it possible:
	  
<ul class="text">
<li> for the IPsec/IKE to migrate endpoint addresses IPsec SAs
              from one to another.

<li>to make the source address to be used by the key manager for
	      SA negotiation available before it is needed.
</li>
<li> to update addresses of IKE_SA after movement.
</li>
</ul>
	
</li>
<li> An additional requirement associated with the solution for
	  IKE is the addition in SPD image of additional per-SP hints

PF_KEY MIGRATE Message Format</h3>

<p> The figure below shows the message format of PF_KEY MIGRATE.
	The message consists of 7 parts (boundary of each part is
	marked with ">").  The message starts with PF_KEY base message
	header directly followed by a sadb_x_kmaddress{}
	structure. The extension holds the two IKE_SA local and remote
	addresses as opaque data for the key manager (two 64-bit
	aligned sockaddr). It is then followed by two address
	extensions: those respectively hold source and destination
	addresses of the selector. The rest of the message is specific
	to IPsec implementations on BSD and Linux. sadb_x_policy{}
	structure holds additional information of security policy.
	The last part of the message is a pair of
	sadb_x_ipsecrequest{} structures that hold old and new SA
	information.
