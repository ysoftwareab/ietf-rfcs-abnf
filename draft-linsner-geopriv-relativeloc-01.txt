Abstract 

   This document defines additional civic address parameters for use in 
   Location Objects [1] and [4].  The format is based on the civic 
   address definition of PIDF-LO.  These additional parameters allow 
   expression of a relative location.

1. Introduction 

   Wireless LAN technologies are adding capabilities to locate serving 
   hosts via radio frequency measurement technologies.  This new 
   capability is able to provide additional and more accurate location 
   information when used inside a building, or on a campus in 
   conjunction with civic addressing.   The data produced from these 
   technologies is most useful if expressed as relative position.  
   Relative position dictates the expression of an anchor point, or 
   starting point for measurement, hence providing both the relative 
   position and relative location offset from the relative position is 
   provided. 

   The data included within the relative position parameters is 
   supplementary to, not exclusive of, the existing civic location data 
   expressed in PIDF-LO [1] and DHCP Civic Location option [4].  An 
   example of this may be a popular wireless hotspot located at 234 N.

   Main St.  It is reasonable to expect that 234 N. Main St. covers a 
   geographic area that encompasses several hundred square meters.  The 
   wireless network architecture for this hotspot could include several 
   wireless infrastructure access points.  The supplementary data 
   provided via relative location would enable a more granular location 
   expression.  In addition to providing 234 N. Main St., a relative 
   position like "20 feet south and 40 feet east of the main entrance" 
   could be added. 

   It is expected this supplementary civic location data will be used 
   within the confines of the associated civic location and SHOULD not 
   be used to represent locations that are off-campus, or outside the 
   boundary of the expressed civic address.  In other words, using the 
   cited example, providing a street address of 234 N. Main St. and then 
   provide this relative location data that result in the location 
   residing at another street address SHOULD not be allowed. 

   Although [1] and [4] currently supports additional elements, like 
   CAtypes 28 (room), 32 (additional code), or 33 (seat), results from 
   the radio frequency measurement technologies are alternatives to 
   these existing elements and in some cases the resultant location can 
   be more accurate. 

2. Additions to PIDF-LO 

   PIDF-LO, as updated by [2], includes a full set of parameters used to 
   describe civic locations.  The new parameters defined here are 
   additional to the updated set and provide a means to describe a 
   host's civic location with added granularity. 

3. Additions to DHCP Civic Location Option 

   The new parameters defined here are additional and will update DHCP 
   Civic Location Option [4] 

4. Relative Location 

   Relative location is defined by 2 new parameters, reference point and 
   relative position.  Reference point, similar to geodetic datum, 
   defines the anchor point (0,0 point) used for measurement of the 
   relative position parameter.  Measurement from the anchor point is 
   provided in 3 dimensions, X, Y and Z.  The east-west dimension is 
   labeled X and north-south dimension is labeled Y.  A positive Y value 
   is considered north of the reference point, a negative Y value south 
   of the reference point, a positive X value for east of the reference 
   point and a negative X value for west of the reference point.  An 
   additional value in this relative position parameter defines the unit

   of measure (UoM).  Lack of expressing a measurement unit defaults the 
   unit value to meters. 

   The fourth, height or altitude parameter (Z) found in normal geodetic 
   systems can be optionally expressed via these new parameters but 
   might be more useful converted to floor values and expressed in via 
   CAtype 27, the FLR or Floor parameter, previously defined for [1] and 
   [4].  If the altitude (Z) parameter is expressed, it is assumed to 
   utilize locally significant ground level (the ground directly below 
   the relative location) as the reference point from which to measure. 

   To provide the most accurate location and due to the uniqueness of 
   earth curvature with respect to perpendicular lines, the east-west 
   measurement SHOULD be calculated/plotted first, followed by the 
   north-south value. 

   For this usage, defining the reference point of local significance is 
   completely subjective, but utilizing intuitively obviously locations, 
   like 'Elevator', 'Exit Door', 'Stairwell', etc. is suggested.

6. Security Considerations 

   The XML parameters defined in the document are additions to the 
   current PIDF-LO specification.  Therefore the parameters defined here 
   are subject to the same security considerations of [1].

   IANA will update the registered XML schema with additions as shown in 
   section 5. of this document.
