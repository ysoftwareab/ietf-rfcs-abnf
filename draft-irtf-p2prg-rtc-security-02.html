<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
      Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks offer higher robustness against
      failure, easier configuration and are generally more economical
      than their client-server counterparts. It has therefore become
      reasonable for resource consuming and typically centralized
      applications like Voice over IP (VoIP) and, in general, realtime
      communication to adapt and exploit the benefits of P2P.  Such a
      migration needs to address a new set of P2P specific security
      problems. This document describes some of the known issues found
      in common P2P networks, analyzing the relevance of such issues
      and the applicability of existing solutions when using P2P
      architectures for realtime communication.

Introduction</h3>

<p>
      Peer to Peer (P2P) overlays have become quite popular with the
      advent of file-sharing applications such as <a class='info' href='#NAPSTER'>Napster<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Napster,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> [NAPSTER], <a class='info' href='#KAZAA'>KaZaa<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;KaZaa,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> [KAZAA] and <a class='info' href='#BITTORRENT'>BitTorrent<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;BitTorrent,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> [BITTORRENT]. After their success in
      file-sharing and <a class='info' href='#Androutsellis-Theotokis'>content
      distribution<span> (</span><span class='info'>Androutsellis-Theotokis, S. and D. Spinellis, &ldquo;A survey of peer-to-peer content distribution technologies,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> [Androutsellis&#8209;Theotokis], P2P networks are now also being used for
      applications such as Voice over IP (VoIP) <a class='info' href='#SKYPE'>[SKYPE]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Skype,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>
      <a class='info' href='#Singh'>[Singh]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Singh, K. and H. Schulzrinne, &ldquo;Peer-to-Peer Internet Telephony using SIP,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> and television <a class='info' href='#PPLIVE'>[PPLIVE]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;PPLive,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>
      <a class='info' href='#COOLSTREAM'>[COOLSTREAM]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;COOLSTREAMING,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>. However most of these systems are
      not purely P2P and have centralized components like the login
      server in Skype <a class='info' href='#Baset'>[Baset]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Baset, S. and H. Schulzrinne, &ldquo;An analysis of the skype peer-to-peer internet telephony protocol,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> or moderators and
      trackers in BitTorrent <a class='info' href='#Pouwelse'>[Pouwelse]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Pouwelse, J., Garbacki, P., Epema, D., and H. Sips, &ldquo;The Bittorent P2P File-Sharing System: Measurements and Analysis,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>.  Securing pure
      P2P networks is therefore still a field of very active research
      <a class='info' href='#Wallach'>[Wallach]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Wallach, D., &ldquo;A Survey of Peer-to-Peer Security Issues,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>.
    
</p>
<p>
      P2P overlays can be broadly classified as structured and
      unstructured <a class='info' href='#RFC4981'>[RFC4981]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Risson, J. and T. Moors, &ldquo;Survey of Research towards Robust Peer-to-Peer Networks:         Search Methods,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>, depending on their
      routing model. Unstructured overlays are often relatively simple
      but search operations in them, usually based on flooding, tend
      to be inefficient. Structured P2P overlays use distributed hash
      tables (DHT) <a class='info' href='#Stoica'>[Stoica]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Stoica, I., Morris, R., Karger, D., Kaashoek, M., and H. Balakrishnan, &ldquo;Chord: A Scalable Peer-to-peer Lookup Service for Internet Applications,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> <a class='info' href='#Maymounkov'>[Maymounkov]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Maymounkov, P. and D. Mazi, &ldquo;Kademlia: A Peer-to-peer Information System Based on the XOR Metric,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>
      <a class='info' href='#Rowstron'>[Rowstron]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rowstron, A. and P. Druschel, &ldquo;Pastry: Scalable, distributed object location and routing for large-scale peer-to-peer systems,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> to perform directed searches which
      make lookups more efficient in locating data. This document will
      mostly focus on DHT-based P2P overlays.
    
</p>
<p>
      When analyzing the various attacks that are possible on P2P
      systems, it is important to first understand the motivation of
      the attackers as well as the resources (i.e. computation power,
      access to different IP subnets) that they would have at their
      disposal.
    
</p>
<p>
      Once the threat has been identified, admission control is a
      first step towards security that can help avoid a substantial
      number of attacks <a class='info' href='#Kim'>[Kim]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kim, Y., Mazzocchi, D., and G. Tsudik, &ldquo;Admission Control in Peer Groups,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>. Most solutions rely on
      the assumption that malicious nodes represent a small fraction
      of all peers. It is therefore important to restrict their number
      in the overlay.
    
</p>
<p>
      Other P2P specific security problems discussed here include
      attacks on the routing of queries, targeted denial of service
      attacks and attacks on data integrity.
    
</p>
<p>
      In the remainder of this document, we outline the main security
      issues and proposed solutions for P2P systems.  Following this,
      we focus on a particular P2P application: realtime
      communications.  Realtime communications use the same DHTs used
      by file-sharing applications, however, the data that is saved in
      these DHTs is different.  In realtime communications, the
      contents stored in the DHTs comprises of user location, the DHT
      being the substitute for a centralized registration server.
    
</p>
<p>
      From a technical point of view, it appears that realtime
      communication services are no different than file-sharing
      services, <a class='info' href='#tab:differences'>Table&nbsp;1</a> demonstrates that
      there are sizeable differences related to privacy, availability,
      and a marked increase in the general security requirements.

<a name="rfc.section.2.1"></a><h3>2.1.&nbsp;
Incentive of the attacker</h3>

<p>
        Attacks on networks happen for a variety of reasons such as
        monetary gain, personal enmity or even for fame in the hacker
        community. There are quite a few well known cases of denial of
        service attacks for extortion in the client-server model <a class='info' href='#McCue'>[McCue]<span> (</span><span class='info'>McCue, Andy., &ldquo;Bookie reveals 100,000 cost of denial-of-service extortion attacks,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>. One of the salient points of the P2P model
        is that the services it provides have higher robustness
        against failure. However, denial of service attacks are still
        possible against individuals within the overlay if the
        attackers possess sufficient resources. For instance, a
        network of worm-affected malicious nodes spread across the
        Internet and controlled by an attacker (often referred to as
        botnet) could simultaneously bombard lookup queries for a
        particular key in the DHT.  The peer responsible for this key
        would then come under a lot of load and could crash <a class='info' href='#Sit'>[Sit]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Sit, E. and R. Morris, &ldquo;Security considerations for peer-to-peer distributed hash tables,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>. However with replication of key-value pairs at
        multiple locations, such threats can be mitigated.
      
</p>
<p>
        Attackers may also have other incentives indirectly related to
        money. With the growth of illegal usage of sharing files with
        copyrights, record companies have been known to pollute
        content in the overlays by putting up nodes with corrupt
        chunks of data but with correct file names to degrade the
        service <a class='info' href='#Liang'>[Liang]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Liang, J., Kumar, R., Xi, Y., and K. Ross, &ldquo;Pollution in p2p file sharing systems,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> and in hope that users would
        get frustrated and stop using it.  Similarly, competition
        between different communications service providers, either or
        both based on P2P technologies, and the low level of
        traceability of attacks targeted to single users could be
        considered as motivation for attemping service disruption.
      
</p>
<p>
        Attacks can also be launched by novice attackers who are there
        attacking the overlay for fun or fame in a community. These
        are perhaps less likely to be successful or cause damage,
        since their resources tend to be relatively limited.

<a name="rfc.section.2.2"></a><h3>2.2.&nbsp;
Resources available to the attacker</h3>

<p>
        Resource constraints play an important role in determining the
        nature of the attack. An attacker who controls a botnet can
        use an Internet relay channel and launch distributed denial of
        service attacks against another node.  With respect to attacks
        where a single node impersonates multiple identities, as in
        the case of the <a class='info' href='#Douceur'>Sybil attack<span> (</span><span class='info'>Douceur, J., &ldquo;The Sybil Attack,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> [Douceur]
        described in <a class='info' href='#det.pos'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Determining the position in the overlay</span><span>)</span></a>, IP addresses are also
        an important resource for the attacker since in DHTs such as
        <a class='info' href='#Stoica'>Chord<span> (</span><span class='info'>Stoica, I., Morris, R., Karger, D., Kaashoek, M., and H. Balakrishnan, &ldquo;Chord: A Scalable Peer-to-peer Lookup Service for Internet Applications,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> [Stoica], the position in the
        overlay is determined by using a base hash function such as
        <a class='info' href='#SHA1'>SHA-1<span> (</span><span class='info'>180-1, FIPS., &ldquo;Secure Hash Standard,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> [SHA1]on the node's IP address. The
        cryptographic puzzles <a class='info' href='#Rowaihy'>[Rowaihy]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rowaihy, H., Enck, W., McDaniel, P., and T. Porta, &ldquo;Limiting Sybil attacks in structured peer-to-peer networks,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> that are
        sometimes suggested as a way to deter Sybil attacks by making
        the join process harder are futile against an attacker with a
        botnet and virtually unlimited computation power. Doucer <a class='info' href='#Douceur'>[Douceur]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Douceur, J., &ldquo;The Sybil Attack,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> proves that even with the assumption that
        attackers only have minimum resources at their disposal, it is
        not possible to defend against them in a pure P2P system.

<a name="rfc.section.2.3"></a><h3>2.3.&nbsp;
Victim of the attack</h3>

<p>
        The victim of an attack could be an individual node, a
        particular content entry or the entire overlay service. If
        malicious nodes are strategically placed in the overlay, they
        can block a node from using its services. Attacks could also
        be launched against specific content <a class='info' href='#Sit'>[Sit]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Sit, E. and R. Morris, &ldquo;Security considerations for peer-to-peer distributed hash tables,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> or
        even the entire overlay service. For example, if the malicious
        nodes are randomly placed in the overlay and drop packets or
        upload malicious content, then the quality of the overlay
        would deteriorate.

<a name="rfc.section.2.4"></a><h3>2.4.&nbsp;
Time of attack</h3>

<p>
        A malicious node could start misbehaving as soon as it enters
        the overlay or it could follow the rules of the overlay for a
        finite amount of time and then attack. The latter could prove
        to be more harmful if the overlay design suggests accumulating
        trust in peers based on the amount of time they have been
        present and/or not misbehaving.  In <a class='info' href='#Maymounkov'>Kademlia<span> (</span><span class='info'>Maymounkov, P. and D. Mazi, &ldquo;Kademlia: A Peer-to-peer Information System Based on the XOR Metric,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> [Maymounkov], for instance, the routing
        tables are populated with nodes that have been up for a
        certain amount of time. While this provides some robustness
        from attacks in which the malicious nodes start dropping
        routing requests from the moment they enter, it would take
        time for the algorithm to adapt to nodes which start
        misbehaving in a later stage (i.e., after they have been
        recorded in routing tables).  Similarly for reputation
        management systems, it is important that they adapt to the
        current behavior of a peer.

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
Admission control</h3>

<p>
      Admission control depends on who decides whether or not to admit
      a node and how this permission is granted. <a class='info' href='#Kim'>Kim et al.<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kim, Y., Mazzocchi, D., and G. Tsudik, &ldquo;Admission Control in Peer Groups,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> [Kim] answer these questions
      independently of any particular environment or application.
      They define two basic elements for admission in a peer group, a
      group charter, which is an electronic document that specifies
      the procedure of admission into the overlay, and a group
      authority, which is an entity that can certify group
      admission. A prospective member first gets a copy of the group
      charter, satisfies the requirements and approaches the group
      authority. The group authority then verifies the admission
      request and grants a group membership certificate.
    
</p>
<p>
      The group charter and authority verification can be provided by
      a centralized certificate authority or a trusted third party, or
      it could be provided by the peers themselves (by voting). The
      former is more practical and tends to make the certification
      process simpler although it is in violation of the pure P2P
      model and exposes the system to attacks typical for server-based
      solutions (e.g., denial of service attacks targeted to the
      central authority). In the latter case, the group authority
      could either be a fixed number of peers or it could be a dynamic
      number based on the total membership of the group. The authors
      argue that even if the group charter requires a prospective
      member to get votes from peers, the group membership certificate
      must be issued by a distinct entity. The reason for this is that
      voters need to accompany their votes with a certificate that
      proves their own membership.  Possible signature schemes that
      could be used in voting such as plain digital signature,
      threshold signature and accountable subgroup multisignature are
      also described. <a class='info' href='#Saxena'>Saxena et al.<span> (</span><span class='info'>Saxena, N., Tsudik, G., and J. Yi, &ldquo;Admission Control in Peer-to-Peer: Design and Performance Evaluation,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> [Saxena]
      performed experiments with the different signature schemes and
      suggest the use of plain signatures for groups of moderate size
      and where bandwidth is not a concern. For larger groups and
      where bandwidth is a concern, they suggest threshold signature
      <a class='info' href='#Kong'>[Kong]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kong, J., Zerfos, P., Luo, H., Lu, S., and L. Zhang, &ldquo;Providing robust and ubiquitous security support for MANET,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> and multisignature schemes <a class='info' href='#Ohta'>[Ohta]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ohta, K., Micali, S., and L. Reyzin, &ldquo;Accountable Subgroup Multisignatures,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>.
    
</p>
<p>
      Another way of handling admission would be to use mechanisms
      based on trust and recommendation where each new applicant has
      to be known and vouched for by at least N existing members. The
      difficulties that such models represent include identity
      assertion and preventing bot/worm attacks. A compromised node
      could have a valid certificate identifying a trustworthy peer
      and it would be difficult to detect this. Possible solutions
      include sending graphic or logic puzzles easily addressed by
      humans but hard to solve by computers, also known as <a class='info' href='#Ahn'>CAPTCHA<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ahn, L., Blum, M., and J. Langford, &ldquo;Telling humans and computers apart automatically,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> [Ahn]; however, reliability of such
      mechanisms is at the time of writing a topic of lively debate

Determining the position in the overlay</h3>

<p>
      For ring based DHT overlays such as <a class='info' href='#Stoica'>Chord<span> (</span><span class='info'>Stoica, I., Morris, R., Karger, D., Kaashoek, M., and H. Balakrishnan, &ldquo;Chord: A Scalable Peer-to-peer Lookup Service for Internet Applications,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> [Stoica], <a class='info' href='#Maymounkov'>Kademlia<span> (</span><span class='info'>Maymounkov, P. and D. Mazi, &ldquo;Kademlia: A Peer-to-peer Information System Based on the XOR Metric,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> [Maymounkov] and <a class='info' href='#Rowstron'>Pastry<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rowstron, A. and P. Druschel, &ldquo;Pastry: Scalable, distributed object location and routing for large-scale peer-to-peer systems,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> [Rowstron], when a node joins the overlay, it
      uses a numeric identifier (ID) to determine its position in the
      ring. The positioning of a node determines what information it
      stores and which nodes it serves. To provide a degree of
      robustness, content and services are often replicated across
      multiple nodes. However it is possible for an adversary with
      sufficient resources to undermine the redundancy deployed in the
      overlay by representing multiple identities. Such an attack is
      called a <a class='info' href='#Douceur'>Sybil attack<span> (</span><span class='info'>Douceur, J., &ldquo;The Sybil Attack,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> [Douceur]. This makes
      the assignment of IDs very important. One possible scheme to
      tackle such attacks on the ID mapping is to have a temporal
      mechanism in which nodes need to re-join the network after some
      time <a class='info' href='#Condie'>[Condie]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Condie, T., Kacholia, V., Sankararaman, S., Hellerstein, J., and P. Maniatis, &ldquo;Maelstorm: Churn as Shelter,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> <a class='info' href='#Scheideler'>[Scheideler]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Scheideler, C., &ldquo;How to Spread Adversarial Nodes?: Rotate!,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>. Such
      temporal solutions, however have the drawback that they increase
      the maintenance traffic and possibly deteriorate the efficiency
      of caching.  <a class='info' href='#Danezis'>Danezis et al.<span> (</span><span class='info'>Danezis, G., Lesniewski-Laas, C., Kaashoek, M., and R. Anderson, &ldquo;Sybil-resistant DHT routing,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> [Danezis]
      suggest mechanisms to mitigate the effect of Sybil attacks by
      reducing the amount of information received from malicious
      nodes. Their idea is to vary the nodes used for routing with
      time and thus avoid a trust bottleneck. Other solutions suggest
      making the joining process harder by introducing cryptographic
      puzzles as suggested by <a class='info' href='#Rowaihy'>Rowaihy
      et al.<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rowaihy, H., Enck, W., McDaniel, P., and T. Porta, &ldquo;Limiting Sybil attacks in structured peer-to-peer networks,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> [Rowaihy]. The assumption is that the adversary has limited
      computational resources which may not be true if the adversary
      has control over a botnet. Another drawback of such methods is
      that non-malicious nodes would also have to perform the extra
      computations before they can join the overlay.
    
</p>
<p>
      A possible heuristic to hamper Sybil attacks is to employ
      redundancy at nodes with diametrically opposite IDs (in the DHT
      ID space) instead of successive IDs as in Chord. The idea behind
      choosing diametrically opposite nodes is based on the fact that
      a malicious peer can grant admission to others as its successor
      without them actually possessing the required IP address (whose
      hash is adjacent to the former's), and then they can cooperate
      to control access to that part of the ring. If however admission
      decisions and redundant content (for robustness), also involve
      nodes which are the furthest away (diametrically opposite) from
      a given position, then the adversary would require double
      resources (IP addresses) to attack. This happens because the
      adversary would need presence in the overlay at two independent
      positions in the ring.
    
</p>
<p>
      Another approach proposed by <a class='info' href='#Yu'>Yu et
      al.<span> (</span><span class='info'>Yu, H., Kaminsky, M., Gibbons, P., and A. Flaxman, &ldquo;SybilGuard: Defending Against Sybil Attacks via Social Networks,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> [Yu]. to limit Sybil attacks is based on the usage of the
      social relations between users. Authors use the fact that as a
      result of Sybil attacks, affected P2P overlays end up containing
      a large set of Sybil nodes connected to the rest of the peers
      through an irregularly small number of edges.  The <a class='info' href='#Yu'>SybilGuard protocol<span> (</span><span class='info'>Yu, H., Kaminsky, M., Gibbons, P., and A. Flaxman, &ldquo;SybilGuard: Defending Against Sybil Attacks via Social Networks,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> [Yu] defines a method that
      allows to discover such kind of discontinuities in the topology
      by using a special kind of a verifiable random walk and hence
      without the need of one node having a global vision of the
      graph.
    
</p>
<p>
      It is also worth mentioning that in DHT overlays using different
      geometric concepts, (e.g., hypercubes instead of rings), peer
      positions are usually not related to identifiers.  In the <a class='info' href='#Ratnasamy'>content addressable network (CAN)<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ratnasamy, S., Francis, P., Handley, M., Karp, R., and S. Shenker, &ldquo;A Scalable Content-Addressable Network,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> [Ratnasamy], for
      example, the position of an entering node may be either selected
      by the node itself, or, with little modification to the original
      algorithm, assigned by peers already in the overlay.  However,
      even when malicious nodes do not know their position before
      joining, the overlay is still vulnerable to Sybil attacks.

      therefore important for other peers to identify such nodes and
      keep track of their number. There are two aspects to this
      problem. One is the identification itself and the second is the
      dissemination of this information amongst the peers.  Different
      metrics need to be defined depending on the peer group for the
      former and reputation management systems are needed for the

Proactive identification</h3>

<p>
          When acting proactively, peers perform periodic operations
          with the purpose of detecting malicious activity. A
          malicious node could prevent access to content it is
          responsible for (e.g., by claiming the object doesn't
          exist), or return references to content that does not match
          the original queries <a class='info' href='#Sit'>[Sit]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Sit, E. and R. Morris, &ldquo;Security considerations for peer-to-peer distributed hash tables,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>. With this
          approach, publishers of content can later perform lookups
          for it at periodic intervals and verify the integrity of
          whatever is returned. Any inconsistencies could then be
          interpreted as malicious activity.  The problem with
          proactive identification is the management of the overhead
          it implies: if checks are performed too often, they may
          actually hinder scalability, while, if they are performed
          too rarely, they would probably be useless.

Reactive identification</h3>

<p>
          In a reactive strategy, the peers perform normal operations
          and if they happen to detect some malicious activity, then
          they can label the responsible node as malicious. In a
          file-sharing application for example, after downloading
          content from a node, if the peer observes that data does not
          match its original query it can identify the corresponding
          node as malicious. <a class='info' href='#Poon'>Poon et al.<span> (</span><span class='info'>Poon, W. and R. Chang, &ldquo;Robust Forwarding in Structured Peer-to-Peer Overlay Networks,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> [Poon]
          suggest a strategy based on the forwarding of queries. If
          routing is done in an iterative way, then dropping of
          packets, forwarding to an incorrect node and delay in
          forwarding arouse suspicion and the corresponding peer is
          identified as malicious.

Violante, &ldquo;A Reputation-Based Approach for Choosing Reliable Resources in Peer-to-Peer Networks,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> [Damiani]. The basic idea of
          these is that each peer maintains information about its own
          experience with other peers and resources, and shares it
          with others on demand. In the system proposed by <a class='info' href='#Uzun'>Uzun et al.<span> (</span><span class='info'>Uzun, E., Pariente, M., and A.

          and distrust vectors for every other node that it has
          interacted with. When reputation information about a peer is
          required, a node first checks its local database, and if
          insufficient information is present, it sends a query to its
          neighbors just as it would when looking up content.
          However, such an approach requires peers to get reputation
          information from as many sources as possible; otherwise,
          malicious nodes may succesfully place targeted attacks
          returning false values for their victims.

Structured reputation management</h3>

<p>
          One of the problems with unstructured reputation management
          systems is that they either take the feedback from few

          a structured manner. The idea of the <a class='info' href='#Kamvar'>eigen trust algorithm<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kamvar, S., Garcia-Molina, H., and M. Schlosser, &ldquo;The EigenTrust Algorithm for Reputation Management in P2P Networks,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> [Kamvar] for example, is
          transitivity of trust. If a node trusts peer X then it would
          also trust the feedback it gives about other peers. A node
          builds such information in an iterative way; for maintaining
          it in a structured way, the authors propose to use a <a class='info' href='#Ratnasamy'>content addressable network (CAN)

          replicated on different peers to provide robustness against
          malicious nodes. They also suggest favoring peers
          probabilistically with high trust values instead of doing it
          deterministically, to allow new peers to slowly develop a
          reputation.  Eventually, they suggest the use of incentives
          for peers with high reputation values.

Routing and data integrity</h3>

<p>
      Preserving integrity of routing and data, or, in other words,
      preventing peers from returning corrupt responses to queries and
      routing through malicious peers, is an important security issue
      in P2P networks. The data stored on a P2P overlay depends on the
      applications that are using it. For file-sharing, this data
      would be the files themselves, their location, and owner
      information. For realtime communication, this would include user
      location bindings and other routing information. We describe
      such data integrity issues separately in <a class='info' href='#p2p.communication'>Section&nbsp;7<span> (</span><span class='info'>Peer-to-peer in realtime communication</span><span>)</span></a>.

Data integrity</h3>

<p>
        For file-sharing applications, insertion of wrong content
        (e.g. files not matching their names or descriptions) or
        introduction of corrupt data chunks (often referred to as
        poisoning and pollution) are a significant
        problem. Bit-Torrent uses voluntary moderators to weed out
        bogus files and the SHA-1 algorithm to determine the hash of
        each piece of a file to allow verification of integrity. If a
        peer detects a bad chunk, it can download that chunk from
        another peer. With this strategy, different peers download
        different pieces of a file before the original peer disappears
        from the network. However, if a malicious peer modifies the
        pieces that are only available on it and the original peer
        disappears, then the object distribution will fail <a class='info' href='#Zhang'>[Zhang]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Zhang, X., Chen, S., and R.

Peer-to-peer in realtime communication</h3>

<p>
      The idea of using P2P in realtime communication essentially
      implies distributing centralized entities from conventional
      architectures over P2P overlays and thus reducing the costs of
      deployment and increasing reliability of the different
      services. Initiatives such as the <a class='info' href='#P2PSIP'>P2PSIP
      working group in IETF<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;Peer-to-Peer Session Initiation Protocol (P2PSIP) IETF Working Group,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> [P2PSIP] are currently concentrating on
      achieving this by using a DHT for services such as registration,
      location lookup, and support for NAT traversal, which are
      normally handled by dedicated servers.
    
</p>
<p>
      Even if based on the same technology, overlays used for realtime
      communication differ from those used for file sharing in at
      least two aspects:

      </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
          Resource consumption. Contrary to file sharing systems where
          the DHT is used to store huge amounts of data (even if the
          distributed database is used only for storing file
          locations, each user usually indexes hundreds or thousands
          of files), realtime communication overlays only require a
          subset of the resources available at any given time as users
          only register a limited number of locations (rarely more
          than one).
        
</li>
<li>
          Confidentiality.  In file-sharing applications,
          eavesdropping and identity theft do not constitute real
          threats; after all, files are supposed to be made publicly
          available.  This is not true in realtime communications,
          where the privacy and confidentiality of the participants is
          of paramount importance.  Furthermore, the notion of
          identity plays an important role in realtime communications
          since it is the basis for starting a communication session.
          As such, it is essential to have mechanisms to unequivocally
          assert identities in realtime communication systems.
        
</li>
</ul><p>
    
</p>
<p>
      In this section we go over the admission issues and security
      problems discussed in previous sections, and discuss solutions
      that would be applicable to realtime communication in P2P.

Peer promotion</h3>

<p>
        In order to keep as much compatibility with existing user
        agents as possible, nodes in P2P communication architectures
        would probably have to participate as either peers or
        clients. If a node participates as a client, then it would use
        the overlay network by simply attaching to a peer or a proxy
        instead of registering with a server. In most cases users
        would be able to benefit from the overlay by only acting as
        clients. However, in order to keep the solution scalable, at
        some point clients would have to be promoted to peers
        (admission to the DHT). This requires addressing the following
        issues.

          generally leave it to the clients to determine if and when

          networks used for realtime communications today.  Instances
          of the Skype application are supposed to operate as either
          super-nodes, directly contributing to the distributed
          provision of the service, or ordinary-nodes, simply using
          the service, and the "promotions" are decided by the higher

          there is not much difference for a client whether it has to
          actively ask for authorization to join an overlay, or
          passively wait for an invitation, the latter approach has
          some advantages which fit well in overlays where only a

              is when clients initiate the join themselves, adds an
              extra constraint for the peer that has to act upon the

Which clients to upgrade</h3>

<p>
          Selecting which clients to upgrade would require defining
          and keeping track of new metrics. The exact set of metrics
          and how they influence decisions should be the subject of
          serious analysis and experimentation. These could be based
          on the following observations:

          </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
              Uptime. A peer could easily record the amount of time
              that it has been maintaining a connection with a client
              and take it into account when trying to determine
              whether or not to upgrade it.
            
</li>
<li>
              Level of activity. It is reasonable to assume that the
              more a client uses the service (e.g. making phone
              calls), the less they would be willing to degrade it.
            
</li>
<li>
              Keeping track of history. Peers could record history of
              the clients they invite and the way they contribute to
              the overlay.
            
</li>
</ul><p>

           Other metrics such as public vs. private IP addresses,
           computation power, and bandwidth should also be taken into
           account even though they do not necessarily have a direct
           impact on security.

<a name="rfc.section.7.1.4"></a><h3>7.1.4.&nbsp;
Incentives for clients</h3>

<p>
          Clients need to have incentives for accepting upgrades in
          order to prevent excessive burden on existing peers. One way
          to handle this would be to maintain separate incentive
          management through the use of currency or credits. Another
          option would involve embedding these incentives inside the
          protocol itself:

          </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
              Peers share with clients only a fraction of their
              bandwidth (uplink and downlink). This would result in
              higher latency when using the services of the overlay as
              a client and better service quality for peers.
            
</li>
<li>
              Peers could restrict the number or types of calls that
              they allow clients to make.
            
</li>
</ul><p>

          Introducing such incentives, however, may turn out to be
          somewhat risky. Differences in quality would probably be
          perceptible for end users who would not always be able to
          understand the difference between the roles that their user
          agent is playing in the overlay. Such behavior may therefore
          be interpreted as arbitrary and make the service look
          unreliable.

          information. A malicious node could return IP addresses of
          other malicious nodes when queried for a particular ID.  The
          requesting peer would then establish a session with a second
          malicious node which would again return a "poisoned"
          reply. This could go on until the TTL expires and the

Trust between peers</h3>

<p>
          The effect of malicious peers could be mitigated by
          introducing the concept of trust within an overlay. This can
          be done in different ways:

          </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
              Using certificates assigned by an external authority.
              The drawback with this approach is that it requires a
              centralized element.
            
</li>
<li>
              Using certificates reciprocally signed by peers.  This
              mechanism is quite similar to <a class='info' href='#Zimmermann'>PGP<span> (</span><span class='info'>Zimmermann, Philip., &ldquo;Pretty good privacy: public key encryption for the masses,&rdquo; 1995.</span><span>)</span></a> [Zimmermann]; every peer signs
              certificates of "friend" peers and trusts any other peer
              with a certificate signed by one of its friends.
              However even though it might be theoretically possible,
              in reality it is extremely difficult to obtain long
              enough trust chains.

<a name="rfc.section.7.2.4"></a><h3>7.2.4.&nbsp;
Routing call signaling</h3>

<p>
          One way for implementing realtime communication overlays (as
          we have mentioned in earlier sections) would be to simply
          replace centralized entities in signalling protocols like
          <a class='info' href='#RFC3261'>SIP<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Schulzrinne, H., Camarillo, G., Johnston, A., Peterson, J., Sparks, R., Handley, M., and E. Schooler, &ldquo;SIP: Session Initiation Protocol,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3261] with distributed
          services. In some cases this might imply reusing existing
          protocol mechanisms for routing signalling messages. In the
          case of SIP this would imply regarding peers as SIP
          proxies. However the design of SIP supposes that such
          proxies are trusted, and makes it possible for them to fork
          requests or change their destination, add or remove header
          fields, act as the remote party, and generally manipulate
          message content and semantics
        
</p>
<p>
          However, in a P2P environment where messages may be routed
          through numerous successive peers, some of which might be
          compromised, it is important not to treat them as trusted
          proxies. One way to limit what peers can do is by protecting
          signalling with some kind of end-to-end encryption.
        
</p>
<p>
          Another option would be to extend existing signalling
          protocols and modify the way they route messages in order to
          guarantee secure end-to-end transmission. Gurbani et
          al. define a similar mechanism for SIP <a class='info' href='#Gurbani'>[Gurbani]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Gurbani, V., Willis, D., and F. Audet, &ldquo;Cryptographically Transparent Session Initiation Protocol         (SIP) Proxies,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> that allows nodes to establish a secure
          channel by sending a CONNECT SIP request, and then tunnel
          all SIP messages through it, adopting a similar mechanism to
          the one used for upgrading from HTTP to <a class='info' href='#RFC2818'>HTTPS<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rescorla, E., &ldquo;HTTP Over TLS,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2818].

Integrity of location bindings</h3>

<p>
          It is important to ensure that the location that a user
          registers, usually a (URI, IP) pair, is what is returned to
          the requesting party.  Or the entities that issue the lookup
          request must be able to verify the integrity of this pair. A
          pure P2P approach to allow verification of the integrity of
          location binding information is presented in <a class='info' href='#Seedorf2'>[Seedorf2]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Seedorf, J., &ldquo;Using Cryptographically Generated SIP-URIs to Protect the Integrity of Content in P2P-SIP,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>. The idea is for an entity to choose an
          asymmetric key pair and hash its public key to generate its
          URI. The entity then signs its present location with its
          private key and registers with the quadruple (URI, IP,
          signature, public key). Any entity which looks up for the
          URI and receives such a quadruple can then verify its
          integrity by using the public key and the certificate.
          Another possible merit of such an approach could be that it
          is possible to identify the malicious nodes and maintain a
          black list. However, the resulting URIs are not easy to
          remember and associate with entities. Discovering these URIs
          and associating them with entities would therefore require
          some sort of a directory service. The authors suggest using
          existing authentication infrastructure for this such as a
          certified web service using SSL which can publish an "online
          phone book" mapping users to URIs.

Encrypting content</h3>

<p>
          Using P2P overlays for realtime communication implies that
          content is likely to traverse numerous intermediate peers
          before reaching its destination. A typical example could be
          the use of peers as media relays as a way of traversing NATs
          in VoIP calls.
        
</p>
<p>
          Contrary to publicly shared files, communication sessions
          are in most cases expected to be private. It is therefore
          very important to make sure that no media leaves the client
          application without being encrypted and securely transported
          through a protocol like <a class='info' href='#RFC3711'>SRTP<span> (</span><span class='info'>Baugher, M., McGrew, D., Naslund, M., Carrara, E., and K. Norrman, &ldquo;The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3711].
          However, the extra processing resources required by the
          encryption algorithms, the management of keying material
          (e.g., retrieving public keys when interacting with unknown
          peers) may constitute an expensive task, especially for
          mobile devices.

Other issues</h3>

<p>
          Identifying more specific threats related to the P2P
          realtime communications, would require a clearly defined
          economic model. Answers to the following questions would be
          helpful.

          </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
              To whom do the users pay?
            
</li>
<li>
              Do the users only pay when accessing the public
              telephone network?
            
</li>
<li>
              Is the billing done per call or is it fixed?
            
</li>
</ul><p>

          For instance, the implications of an attack such as taking
          control over another's user agent or its identity and using
          it for outbound calls would depend on whether or not this
          would be economically advantageous for the attacker. <a class='info' href='#Baumann'>Baumann et al.<span> (</span><span class='info'>Baumann, R., Cavin, S., and S. Schmid, &ldquo;Voice Over IP - Security and SPIT,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> [Baumann] suggests that to
          prevent unwanted communication costs, gateways for the
          public telephone network should only be accessible via
          authenticated servers and dialing authorizations should be
          enforced. Also it seems that it would be difficult to do
          billing in a pure P2P manner as it would mean keeping the
          billing details with untrusted peers.

      security issues of P2P systems used for realtime
      communications. It does not aim at identifying all possible
      threats and the corresponding solutions; instead, starting from
      an analysis of the attackers, it delves into some important
      aspects of P2P security, referencing the most relevant works
      published at the time of writing and discussing how they apply
      (or could apply) to the case of realtime communications.

<p>
      The goal of the document is to provide authors of P2P protocols
      for realtime communications with some background they may find
      useful in defining security mechanisms for their specific case.
