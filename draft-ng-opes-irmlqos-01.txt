INTERNET-DRAFT          QoS Extension to IRML             February 2002 
    
    
1. Introduction 
    
   The Intermediary Rule Markup Language (IRML) [2] is an XML-based 
   language that can be used to describe service-specific execution 
   rules for network edge intermediaries under the Open Pluggable Edge 
   Services (OPES) framework, as described in [3] and [4].  This memo 
   specifies a Quality of Service (QoS) subs-system in the IRML, and 
   illustrates examples of employing the IRML for QoS policing and 
   control.  
 
   This memo begins in Section 2 by illustrating a few scenarios where 
   QoS policing and control can be incorporated into the OPES 
   intermediary.  From there, a set of preliminary requirements for QoS 
   sub-system extension to the IRML is drafted in Section 3.  Section 4 
   defines the set of QoS parameters used in the ôpropertyö and 
   ôvariableö elements in the proposed QoS sub-system, and Section 5 
   presents some examples illustrating possible use of the QoS sub-
   system. 
    
1.1. Terms Used 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [5]. 
    
    
2. Example Services for QoS Policing in OPES Services 
    
2.1. Adaptation of HTML Contents 
    
   By far, Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) pages are the most common 
   content transported by the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  
   These HTML contents are usually static, making them ideal candidate 
   to be cached at the network edge.  However, with increasing number 
   of "thin" clients, it is virtually impossible to have a HTML page 
   that is suitable to be viewed for all the possible browsers. 
   Adaptation of HTML pages to suit the clientÆs browser is widely 
   employed (through means of server-side includes such as PHP or 
   client-side JavaScripts).  One excellent example would be the 
   adaptation of HTML to WML (Wireless Markup Language) pages.  
    
   Adaptation of HTML pages can also be employed to suit the user or 
   access-provider QoS requirements.  For example, it might be 
   necessary to remove redundant information when translating HTML 
   pages to WML for a mobile phone client with a very limited bandwidth 
   (and limited screen size).  It will also be helpful to replace the 
   <IMG> tags in the original HTML page to their ALT text equivalence. 
   For another client who is using a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) 
   with a Wideband-CDMA connection, the translated WML may include more 
   of the original HTML contents and some pictures.

   Bandwidth is not the only consideration.  For the example of the PDA 
   client quoted above, when the channel condition is poor, it might be 
   desirable to reduce the amount of text in the translated WML to 
   ensure a more speedy delivery. 
    
   Such HTML adaptation is not only limited to the wireless scenario. 
   For a client with a wired connection to the Internet, it is 
   sometimes necessary to sub-sample the embedded images in the HTML 
   pages to reduce their size so as to meet the maximum delay 
   requirements imposed by the user or access-provider.  This can occur 
   when the allocated bandwidth is small, or when the connection is 
   congested (e.g. the user is downloading a couple of files 
   simultaneously). 
    
2.2. Dynamic Adaptation of Streaming Contents 
    
   Streaming of audio-visual (AV) contents over the Internet has become 
   increasing popular over the years.  AV streaming poses different 
   technical challenges as compared to HTML delivery, with stricter QoS 
   requirements, such as maximum delay and constant/variable bit-rates.  
   When the transport technologies employed within the network core are 
   best-effort delivery in nature, it is very difficult to guarantee 
   the required quality of service. Thus, to maintain the perceived QoS 
   by the user, it is often necessary to dynamically adapt the AV 
   stream to the fluctuating network connection conditions [6].  
   Ideally such adaptation services should be placed near the end-user, 
   so as to reduce the errors in estimating the network conditions at 
   the network edge. This also allows for intermediary to cache the AV 
   contents, and directing the contents to the adaptation service 
   depending on the QoS requirements and channel conditions. 
    
   The use of OPES intermediaries to adapt the AV contents requires 
   that the QoS parameters, such as allocated/requested bandwidth and 
   channel conditions, be made available to the rule decision engine. 
    
2.3. QoS Policy Control 
    
   Often, the OPES services will reside on an intermediary box that is 
   provided by the access provider. Thus one major application of the 
   IRML is to implement policy rules based on the Service Level 
   Agreement (SLA) between the access provider and the end-user. QoS is 
   one important aspect of SLA. 
    
   To illustrate, consider the following scenario where an end-user has 
   a service policy of 64kbps bandwidth.  Suppose the end-user is in 
   the middle of watching a movie at 56kbps when a 16kbps voice-over-IP 
   (VoIP) stream arrives. Instead of simply rejecting the VoIP 
   connection, with IRML services, the access provider (or even the 
   end-user) can now specify policy rules to perform any of following 
   more desirable actions:

   (a) adapts the VoIP stream to the remaining bandwidth,  
    
   (b) adapts the movie stream to give room for the VoIP stream (e.g. 
      mute the audio from the movie), or 
    
   (c) adapts both the movie and VoIP streams. 
    
2.4. Load-Balancing 
    
   The OPES framework in [3] allows for the adaptation services to be 
   performed remotely on a separate, dedicated server, such as an ICAP 
   server.  This allows for scalability. However, when the number of 
   connections is small, it might not be desirable to perform remote 
   callout, as the overhead incurred will add transmission delays. IRML 
   can be employed to redirect content adaptation to a remote server 
   when the load on the intermediary is high, and to use a local 
   proxylet when the load is low.  Such decision can only be done if 
   IRML is extended to environment properties, such as server load. 
    
   In addition to serverÆs processing load, such decision may based on 
   the end-userÆs QoS requirement as well.  For instance, when the 
   server load is moderate, it might process adaptation services for 
   end-users with stricter QoS requirements, and invoke remote 
   adaptation services for end-users with lower QoS requirements. 
    
    
3. Requirements for QoS Sub-System 
    
   In consideration to the example services illustrated in the previous 
   sections, a preliminary set of requirements for the QoS sub-system 
   extension to the IRML can be outlined as follow: 
    
   -  It SHOULD enable rule modules to match the end-user QoS policy 
      requirements against pre-defined labels.  Such QoS policy 
      requirements MAY include, but not limited to, the allocated 
      bandwidth to the end-user, the requested bandwidth for the 
      current connection, and the required delay bound, if any. 
    
   -  It SHOULD enable rule modules to match the transmission 
      statistics of the end-user connection with the intermediary 
      against pre-defined labels.  
    
   -  It SHOULD enable rule modules to match the current system load of 
      the intermediary against pre-defined labels.  The system load MAY 
      be inferred from percentage load, and/or the number of 
      connections the intermediary is handling. 
    
   The above set of requirements is not exhaustive.  Further research 
   work needs to be carried out to evaluate the applicability of these 
   requirements, and append additional requirements if deem 
   appropriate.

4. QoS Sub-System of IRML 
    
   In order to extend QoS-aware services in the OPES intermediary, it 
   is proposed that a QoS sub-system be specified to extend the 
   recognized property names of the "property" and ôvariableö elements 
   in IRML to include various QoS-related properties. These values 
   include static configuration parameters like QoS policy parameters, 
   and dynamic parameters like network conditions values and processing 
   load of the intermediaries. Note that to utilize these parameters, 
   the ôpropertyö or ôvariableö elements MUST specify a ôsub-systemö 
   attribute of ôQoSö. 
    
   Furthermore, since these parameters have numerical values, the QoS 
   sub-system also override the ômatchesö and ônon-matchesö attributes 
   of the ôpropertyö element to handle basic arithmetic comparison 
   instead of regular expression.  These will be described in the 
   following sub-sections. 
    
4.1. QoS Policy Properties 
    
   The following are the proposed QoS policy parameters to that are 
   defined for the "property" element in the QoS sub-system. These 
   values are access control parameters, thus the rule engine can 
   obtain their values via an interface to an access control module.  
   Specification of such interface/module is out of scope. 
    
    
   Property Name            Value 
   -------------------------------------------------------------------- 
   "allocated-bandwidth"    the allocated bandwidth for the end-user 
   "requested-bandwidth"    the requested bandwidth for this connection 
   "available-bandwidth"    the amount of bandwidth available for the 
                            end-user 
   "delay-bound"            the maximum delay requested 
    
    
4.2. Network Status Properties 
    
   The following are the proposed network status parameters that are 
   defined for the "property" element of the QoS sub-system. These 
   dynamic values reflect the current network link status. The rule 
   engine can obtain these values either via an interface to a traffic 
   monitoring module, or a Simple Network Management Protocol (SMNP) 
   agent [7]. In the case of RTP connections, the values of these 
   parameters can also be extracted from the RTCP sender/receiver 
   reports [8]. Specification of such interface/module is out of scope.

   "r-octets-count"         the accumulated number of octets received 
                            by the end-user

                            by the intermediary 
   "r-packets-count"        the accumulated number of packets received 
                            by the end-user 
   "s-packets-count"        the accumulated number of packets received 
                            by the intermediary 
   "r-packets-lost"         the total number of packets not received by 
                            the end-user 
   "s-packets-lost"         the total number of packets not received by 
                            the intermediary 
   "r-fraction-lost"        the fraction of packets lost reported by 
                            the end-user since the previous report 
   "s-fraction-lost"        the fraction of packets lost reported by 
                            the intermediary since the previous report

   "s-jitter"               the inter-arrival jitter reported by the 
                            intermediary 
    
    
   Because the rule engine should be stateless, it might be necessary 
   for the module providing the values of the QoS parameters to provide 
   additional information about the difference in the parameters values 
   after a specific interval. 
    
    
   Property Name            Value 
   --------------------------------------------------------------------

                            recent consecutive reports 
   "s-octets-diff"          the difference in the accumulated number of 
                            octets received by the intermediary of two

   "r-packets-lost-diff"    the difference in the total number of 
                            packets not received by the end-user of two

4.3. Intermediary Load Properties 
    
   The following are the proposed server load parameters that are 
   defined for the "property" element in the QoS sub-system. These 
   values are system environment parameters, thus the rule engine can 
   obtain their values via an interface to a system module.  
   Specification of such an interface/ module is out of scope. 
    
    
   Property Name              Value 
   -------------------------------------------------------------------- 
   "system-processing-load"   the current processing load in percentage 
                              of the intermediary 
   "system-connections"       the current number of established end-
                              user connections  
    
    
4.4. Overriding ômatchesö and ônon-matchesö Attributes in QoS Sub-
     System 
    
   Since the QoS parameters defined for the ôpropertyö element are all 
   numerical in nature, the ômatchesö and ônon-matchesö attributes of 
   the ôpropertyö element are overridden in the QoS sub-system to 
   handle arithmetic comparison instead of regular expression. In QoS 
   sub-system, the ômatchesö and ônon-matchesö handle two types of 
   arithmetic comparisons: (1) arithmetic relation between the QoS 
   property and a specified numerical constant, and (2) the membership 
   of the QoS property in a specified numerical range. 
    
   Comparison between QOS property and specified numerical constant can 
   be constructed using the ô<ö, ô>ö, ô>=ö, and ô<=ö operators. For 
   example, the following rule 
    
        <property name=ösystem-processing-loadö 
                  matches=ö<40ö 
                  sub-system=öQoSö> 
    
   will be evaluated to be true if the current system load of the 
   intermediary is less than 40%, and evaluated to be false otherwise. 
    
   Membership of the QoS parameter in a specified numerical range can 
   be constructed using the ô[min,max]ö, ô[min,max)ö, ô(min, max]ö, and 
   ô(min,max)ö mathematical symbols.  For example, the following rule 
    
        <property name=öallocated-bandwidthö 
                  matches=ö[128000,256000)ö 
                  sub-system=öQoSö> 
    
   will be evaluated to be true if the bandwidth allocated is greater 
   or equal to 128kbps and less than 256kbps.

   The table below shows the evaluation results when a QoS property is 
   evaluated with various ômatchesö attributes.  In the table, ôAö and 
   ôBö represents numerical constants (which can include a decimal 
   point). 
    
    
   ômatchesö Attribute   Evaluation Result 
   --------------------  --------------------------------- 
   ô<Aö                  True if the QoS parameter is less than A; 
                         False otherwise. 
   ô<=Aö                 True if the QoS parameter is less than or 
                         equal to A; false otherwise. 
   ô>Aö                  True if the QoS parameter is greater than A; 
                         false otherwise. 
   ô>=Aö                 True if the QoS parameter is greater than or 
                         equal to A; false otherwise. 
   ô[A,B]ö               True if the QoS parameter is greater than or 
                         equal to A, and less than or equal to B; false 
                         otherwise. 
   ô[A,B)ö               True if the QoS parameter is greater than or 
                         equal to A, and less than B; false otherwise. 
   ô(A,B]ö               True if the QoS parameter is greater than A 
                         and less than or equal to B; false otherwise. 
   ô(A,B)ö               True if the QoS parameter is greater than A 
                         and less than B; false otherwise. 
    
    
   The ônon-matchesö attribute, when specified instead of ômatchesö, 
   will be evaluated to be true when the arithmetic comparison is 
   evaluated to be false, and vice versa. 
    
4.5. The ôcase-sensitiveö Attribute 
    
   Though the ôpropertyö element in the standard IRML has an optional 
   ôcase-sensitiveö attribute, they are not used in the QoS sub-system. 
   This is a direct consequence of overriding the ômatchesö and ônon-
   matchesö attributes to handle arithmetic comparison instead of 
   regular expression. Use of the ôcase-sensitiveö attribute is ignored 
   in the QoS sub-system. 
    
4.6. The ôcontextö Attribute 
    
   The current specification of the QoS sub-system does not define the 
   interpretation of the ôcontextö attribute. It may be possible to use 
   this attribute to identify the interface/module by which the value 
   of the QoS parameter is extracted, such as ôSNMPö or ôRTCPö. Until 
   its appropriate interpretation can be revealed after further 
   analysis, the use of the ôcontextö attribute is ignored by the QoS 
   sub-system.

5. Examples 
    
   The first example below illustrates the case where the adaptation of 
   HTML page to WML page is performed with consideration to the 
   allocated bandwidth of the client. 
    
   <rule processing-point="4"> 
     <!-- check the allocated bandwidth and adapts accordingly --> 
     <property name="allocated-bandwidth" matches="<9600" 
               subsystem=öQoSö> 
       <!-- Bandwidth is low, use tiny WML  --> 
       <execute> 
         <service> 
           <uri>opes://localhost/html2wml?target=tiny</uri> 
         </service> 
       </execute> 
     </property> 
     <property name="allocated-bandwidth" matches="[9600,128000)" 
               sub-system=öQoSö> 
       <!-- Bandwidth is moderate, use small WML  --> 
       <execute> 
         <service> 
           <uri>opes://localhost/html2wml?target=small</uri> 
         </service> 
       </execute> 
     </property> 
     <property name="allocated-bandwidth" matches=">=128000" 
               sub-system=öQoSö> 
       <!-- Bandwidth is high, use large WML  --> 
       <execute> 
         <service> 
           <uri>opes://localhost/html2wml?target=large</uri> 
         </service> 
       </execute> 
     </property> 
   </rule> 
    
   The second example illustrates the scenario where an adaptation 
   service is carried out locally or remotely based on the system 
   processor load of the OPES intermediary.  It also illustrates the 
   adaptations of video stream based on the connection status.  
    
   <rule processing-point="4"> 
     <!-- check the system load to determine using local or 
          remote services --> 
     <property name="system-processing-load" matches=">=80" 
               sub-system=öQoSö> 
       <!-- System load is high, use remote services --> 
       <property name="r-fraction-lost" matches="[0.3,1]"> 
         <!-- high packets loss (>=30%) in end-user, 
              adapts the video stream to small.  -->

         <execute> 
           <service> 
             <uri>opes://video.adpat.server/video-adpat</uri> 
           </service> 
         </execute> 
       </property> 
     </property> 
     <property name="system-processing-load" non-matches=ö>=80ö 
               sub-system=öQoSö> 
       <!-- System load is not high, use local services --> 
       <property name="r-fraction-lost" matches="[0.3,1]"> 
         <!-- high packets loss (>=30%) in end-user, 
              adapts the video stream to small.  --> 
         <execute> 
           <service> 
             <uri>opes://localhost/video-adpat</uri> 
           </service> 
         </execute> 
       </property> 
     </property> 
   </rule> 
    
   The third example shows the adaptation of different content format 
   for different traffic conditions gathered from the network 
   monitoring module for a specific network node or a group of network 
   nodes in delivering Audio-Visual content. Access to the types of 
   content format is based on the different network conditions supplied 
   by the network monitoring module. The rule for accessing the type of 
   content format is being specified based on the type of property 
   used. 
     
   <rule processing-point="1"> 
     <!-- check the allocated bandwidth and adapts accordingly --> 
     <property name="r-jitter" matches=">0.5"> 
       <!-- receiver jitter is high, adapt to use still pictures  --> 
       <execute> 
         <service> 
           <uri>opes://stillimage.server/jpeg-only</uri> 
           <parameter name=öresourceö type=ödynamicö> 
             <variable name=örequest uriö context=ösystemö/> 
           </parameter> 
         </service> 
       </execute> 
     </property> 
     <property name="r-fraction-lost" matches=">0.3"> 
       <!-- receiver accumulated loss is high, suggest using Forward 
            error correction coded content --> 
       <execute> 
         <service> 
           <uri>opes:// videoFEC.correct.server/video-FEC<</uri> 
           <parameter name=öresourceö type=ödynamicö> 
             <variable name=örequest uriö context=ösystemö/>

6. IAB Considerations 
    
   This proposal is an extension to the IRML Specifications [2]. It is 
   to the authorsÆ best knowledge that there exists no inconsistency 
   between this memo and the IRML Specification in regards to IABÆs 
   architectural and policy considerations. 
    
    
7. Security Considerations 
    
   All security considerations in [2] are applicable to the QoS sub-
   system.  There is no security issue to the authorsÆ best knowledge 
   that is specific to the QoS sub-system.
