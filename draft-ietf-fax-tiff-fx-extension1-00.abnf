    The extended profile (i.e. profile plus extension) or more than one 
    profiles that apply to this file; a profile is a subset of the
    full set of permitted fields and field values of TIFF for facsimile.
    This field is used when an extended profile or more than one 
    profiles are used within the file. This field SHALL only be present 
    when the FaxProfile field is absent or has a value of 255 (X'FF').
    A value of 1 in more than one bit location indicates the 
    Corresponding profiles or profile(s) plus extension(s) that are 
    used. The currently defined bits are:

    MultiProfiles[0]:
    Bit 0: minimal black & white lossless, Profile S
    Bit 1: extended black & white lossless, Profile F
    Bit 2: lossless JBIG black & white, Profile J
    Bit 3: lossy color and grayscale, Profile C
    Bit 4: lossless color and grayscale, Profile L
    Bit 5: Mixed Raster Content, Profile M
    Bit 6: lossy and lossless JBIG2 black & white, Profile T
    Bit 7: Extension 1 (E1), resolution and imagewidth extensions
    Bit 8: Extension 2 (E2), N-Layer Profile M extension
    Bit 9: Extension 3 (E3), shared data extension to Profile M
    Bit 10: Extension 5 (E5), JBIG2 extension of Profile M
    Bits 11-31: reserved for future use.

    WARNING: Files containing extensions or more that one profile
    "SHOULD" contain the MultiProfiles field, identifying the profiles
