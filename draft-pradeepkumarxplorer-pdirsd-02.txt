1.  Introduction

Parellel Distributed Information retrieval services
Rudimentary idea first phase

I propose Parallel Dsitributed Information retrieval services where the index is
not with just one company like google or yahoo.
Each access of something results in being indexed or upgraded in rank to be
retrieved.
So if someone access dhyanayoga.info/Californian.html it would be
automatically indexed.
Right now if i am the author of the file i have to manually use some indexing
software given by google or yahoo. I have not done it. Most websites
google.com yahoo.com are not providing easy indexers as well.
So each Webserver would have a PDIRSD daemon or software in the website
If i access https://goodspaguide.co.uk/features/balinese-massage-explained
then my webserver indexes it.
Each PDIRSD webserver would have also a indexer in the website
So if my website is walkonyourtoes.com it would have an indexer
walkonyourtoes/indexer
So i am in Dalung and accessing a URL in camada it might be a transient file,
so dalung would have some list of PDIRSD webservers, the nearest to my client
browser would index the file or information in Canada that i accessed
So the WWW would have many PDISRD servers and a search invokation from
your desktop or smart fone screen would use some algorithm to search for
some PDISRD servers in the WWW
and give you the result.
I also propose a file database in root zone server where toplevel domain names
are stored accessstats or some name.
If i access walkonyourtoes.com then access stats would have
walkonyourtoes.com 1, if another browser accesses walkonyourtoes.com
accessstats would have walkonyourtoes 2 so at the end of the day accessstats
would have all urls accessed during the day and the count and a topurls.com
website can show the top accessed urls and also some display can be used to
show birds eye view of http traffic of the day
There has to be another database accesspaths which shows the clientIP
and accessed URL.. using which a birds eye view of the http accesses
of the day can be seen on a display. It can be categorised all
http accesses of pornography or related to pilates can be also 
seen. 
   

The same computers that keep root zone database of TLDs should have some
file that has all http url accesses in WWW and count.

If i access dhyanayoga.info/Californian.html the file or database would have an 
entry dhyanayoga.info/Californian.html 1
if someone else accesses the count would increase
