               SLAP quadrant selection options for DHCPv6
                    draft-ietf-dhc-slap-quadrant-01

Abstract

   The IEEE originally structured the 48-bit MAC address space in such a
   way that half of it was reserved for local use.  Recently, the IEEE
   has been working on a new specification (IEEE 802c) which defines a
   new "optional Structured Local Address Plan" (SLAP) that specifies
   different assignment approaches in four specified regions of the
   local MAC address space.

   The IEEE is working on mechanisms to allocate addresses in the one of
   these quadrants (IEEE 802.1CQ).  There is work also in the IETF on
   specifying a new mechanism that extends DHCPv6 operation to handle
   the local MAC address assignments.  In this document, we complement
   this ongoing IETF work by defining a mechanism to allow choosing the
   SLAP quadrant to use in the allocation of the MAC address to the
   requesting device/client.

   This document proposes extensions to DHCPv6 protocols to enable a
   DHCPv6 client or a DHCPv6 relay to indicate a preferred SLAP quadrant
   to the server, so that the server allocates the MAC address to the
   given client out of the quadrant requested by relay or client.

1.  Introduction

   The IEEE originally structured the 48-bit MAC address space in such a
   way that half of it was reserved for local use (where the U/L bit is
   set to 1).  Recently, the IEEE has been working on a new
   specification (IEEE 802c [IEEEStd802c-2017]) which defines a new
   "optional Structured Local Address Plan" (SLAP) that specifies
   different assignment approaches in four specified regions of the
   local MAC address space.  These four regions, called SLAP quadrants,
   are briefly described below (see Figure 1 and Figure 2 for details):

   o  Quadrant "Extended Local Identifier" (ELI) MAC addresses are
      assigned based on a Company ID (CID), which takes 24-bits, leaving
      the remaining 24-bits for the locally assigned address for each
      CID for unicast (M-bit = 0) and also for multicast (M-bit = 1).
      The CID is assigned by the IEEE Registration Authority (RA).

   o  Quadrant "Standard Assigned Identifier" (SAI) MAC addresses are
      assigned based on a protocol specified in an IEEE 802 standard.
      For 48-bit MAC addresses, 44 bits are available.  Multiple
      protocols for assigning SAIs may be specified in IEEE standards.
      Coexistence of multiple protocols may be supported by limiting the
      subspace available for assignment by each protocol.

   o  Quadrant "Administratively Assigned Identifier" (AAI) MAC
      addresses are assigned locally by an administrator.  Multicast
      IPv6 packets use a destination address starting in 33-33 and this
      falls within this space and therefore should not be used to avoid
      conflict with IPv6 multicast addresses.  For 48-bit MAC addresses,
      44 bits are available.

   o  Quadrant "Reserved for future use" where MAC addresses may be
      assigned using new methods yet to be defined, or by an
      administrator like in the AAI quadrant.

Internet-Draft       DHCPv6 SLAP quadrant selection            July 2019


1.1.  Problem statement

   The IEEE is working on mechanisms to allocate addresses in the SAI
   quadrant (IEEE 802.1CQ project).  There is also ongoing work in the
   IETF [I-D.ietf-dhc-mac-assign] specifying a new mechanism that
   extends DHCPv6 operation to handle the local MAC address assignments.
   In this document, we complement ongoing IETF work with mechanisms to
   allow choosing the SLAP quadrant to use in the allocation of the MAC
   address to the requesting device/client.  This document proposes
   extensions to DHCPv6 protocols to enable a DHCPv6 client or a DHCPv6
   relay to indicate a preferred SLAP quadrant to the server, so that
   the server allocates the MAC address to the given client out of the
   quadrant requested by relay or client.

   In the following, we describe two application scenarios where a need
   arises to assign local MAC addresses according to preferred SLAP
   quadrants.

1.1.1.  WiFi devices

   Today, most WiFi devices come with interfaces that have a "burned in"
   MAC address, allocated from the universal address space using a
   24-bit Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI, assigned to IEEE 802
   interface vendors).  However, recently, the need to assign local
   (instead of universal) MAC addresses has emerged in particular in the
   following two scenarios:

   o  IoT (Internet of Things): where there are a lot of cheap,
      sometimes short lived and disposable devices.  Examples of this
      include: sensors and actuators for health or home automation
      applications.  In this scenario, it is common that upon a first
      boot, the device uses a temporary MAC address, to send initial
      DHCP packets to available DHCP servers.  IoT devices typically
      request a single MAC address for each available network interface.
      Once the server assigns a MAC address, the device abandons its
      temporary MAC address.  This type of device is typically not
      moving.  In general, any type of SLAP quadrant would be good for
      assigning addresses from, but ELI/SAI quadrants might be more
      suitable in some scenarios, such as if it is needed that the
      addresses belong to the CID assigned to the IoT communication
      device vendor.

   o  Privacy: Today, MAC addresses allow the exposure of users'
      locations making it relatively easy to track users' movement.  One
      of the mechanisms considered to mitigate this problem is the use
      of local random MAC addresses, changing them every time the user
      connects to a different network.  In this scenario, devices are
      typically mobile.  Here, AAI is probably the best SLAP quadrant to

      assign addresses from, as it is the best fit for randomization of
      addresses, and it is not required for the addresses to survive
      when changing networks.

1.1.2.  Hypervisor: migratable vs non-migratable functions

   In large scale virtualization environments, thousands of virtual
   machines (VMs) are active.  These VMs are typically managed by a
   hypervisor, in charge of spawning and stopping VMs as needed.  The
   hypervisor is also typically in charge of assigning new MAC addresses
   to the VMs.  If a DHCP solution is in place for that, the hypervisor
   acts as a DHCP client and requests available DHCP servers to assign
   one or more MAC addresses (an address block).  The hypervisor does
   not use those addresses for itself, but rather uses them to create
   new VMs with appropriate MAC addresses.  If we assume very large data
   center environments, such as the ones that are typically used
   nowadays, it is expected that the data center is divided in different
   network regions, each one managing its own local address space.  In
   this scenario, there are two possible situations that need to be
   tackled:

   o  Migratable functions.  If a VM (providing a given function) might
      need to be potentially migrated to another region of the data
      center (due to maintenance, resilience, end-user mobility, etc.)
      it is needed that this VM can keep its networking context in the
      new region, and this includes keeping its MAC addresses.
      Therefore, for this case, it is better to allocate addresses from
      the ELI/SAI SLAP quadrant, which can be centrally allocated by the
      DHCP server.

   o  Non-migratable functions.  If a VM will not be migrated to another
      region of the data center, there are no requirements associated to
      its MAC address, and then it is more efficient to allocate it from
      the AAI SLAP quadrant, which does not need to be same for all the
      data centers (i.e., each region can manage its own, without
      checking for duplicates globally).

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The DHCPv6 terminology relevant to this specification from the DHCPv6
   Protocol [RFC8415] applies here.

   client        A device that is interested in obtaining link-layer
                 addresses.  It implements the basic DHCPv6 mechanisms
                 needed by a DHCPv6 client as described in [RFC8415] and
                 supports the new options (IA_LL and LLADDR) specified
                 in [I-D.ietf-dhc-mac-assign].  The client may or may
                 not support address assignment and prefix delegation as
                 specified in [RFC8415].

   server        Software that manages link-layer address allocation and
                 is able to respond to client queries.  It implements
                 basic DHCPv6 server functionality as described in
                 [RFC8415] and supports the new options (IA_LL and
                 LLADDR) specified in [I-D.ietf-dhc-mac-assign].  The
                 server may or may not support address assignment and
                 prefix delegation as specified in [RFC8415].

   address       Unless specified otherwise, an address means a link-
                 layer (or MAC) address, as defined in IEEE802.  The
                 address is typically 6 bytes long, but some network
                 architectures may use different lengths.

   address block A number of consecutive link-layer addresses.  An
                 address block is expressed as a first address plus a
                 number that designates the number of additional (extra)
                 addresses.  A single address can be represented by the
                 address itself and zero extra addresses.

3.  Quadrant selection mechanisms

   We next describe some exemplary ways to perform SLAP quadrant
   selection.  These are provided just as informational text to
   exemplify how the quadrant preference mechanisms could be used.

   Let's take first an IoT scenario as an example.  An IoT device might
   decide on its own the SLAP quadrant it wants to use to obtain a local
   MAC address, using the following information to take the decision:

   o  Type of IoT deployment: e.g., industrial, domestic, rural, etc.
      For small deployments, such as domestic ones, the IoT itself can
      decide to use the AAI quadrant (this might not even involve the
      use of DHCP, by the device just configuring a random address
      computed by the device itself).  For large deployments, such as
      industrial or rural ones, where thousands of devices might co-
      exist, the IoT can decide to use the ELI or SAI quadrants.

   o  Mobility: if the IoT device can move, then it might prefer to
      select the SAI or AAI quadrants to minimize address collisions

Internet-Draft       DHCPv6 SLAP quadrant selection            July 2019


      when moving to another network.  If the device is known to remain
      fixed, then the ELI is probably the most suitable one to use.

   o  Managed/unmanaged: depending on whether the IoT device is managed
      during its lifetime or cannot be re-configured, the selected
      quadrant might be different.  For example, it can be managed, this
      means that network topology changes might occur during its
      lifetime (e.g., due to changes on the deployment, such as
      extensions involving additional devices), and this might have an
      impact on the preferred quadrant (e.g., to avoid potential
      collisions in the future).

   o  Operation/battery lifetime: depending on the expected lifetime of
      the device a different quadrant might be preferred (as before, to
      minimize potential address collisions in the future).

   The previous are examples of parameters that an IoT device might use
   to select a given SLAP quadrant.  IoT devices are typically very
   resource constrained, so it might be as well that simple decisions
   are just taken, for example based on pre-configured preferences.

   If we now take the WiFi device scenario, considering for example that
   a laptop or smartphone connects to a network using its built in MAC
   address.  Due to privacy/security concerns, the device might want to
   configure a local MAC address.  The device might use different
   parameters and context information to decide, not only which SLAP
   quadrant to use for the local MAC address configuration, but also
   when to perform a change of address (e.g., it might be needed to
   change address several times).  This information includes, but it is
   not limited to:

   o  Type of network the device is connected: public, work, home.

   o  Trusted network?  Y/N.

   o  First time visited network?  Y/N.

   o  Network geographical location.

   o  Mobility?  Y/N.

   o  OS network profile, including security/trust related parameters.
      Most modern OS keep metadata associated to the networks they can
      attach to, as for example the level of trust the user or
      administrator assigns to the network.  This information is used to
      configure how the device behaves in terms of advertising itself on
      the network, firewall settings, etc.  But this information can




Bernardos & Mourad       Expires January 9, 2020                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft       DHCPv6 SLAP quadrant selection            July 2019


      also be used to decide whether to configure a local MAC address or
      not, from which SLAP quadrant and how often.

   o  Triggers coming from applications regarding location privacy.  An
      app might request to the OS to maximize location privacy (due to
      the nature of the application) and this might mean the OS to force
      the use or change of a local MAC address.

   This information can be used by the device to select the SLAP
   quadrant.  For example, if the device is moving around (e.g., while
   connected to a public network in an airport), it is likely that it
   might change access point several times, and therefore it is best to
   minimize the chances of address collision, using the SAI or AAI
   quadrants.  If the device is not moving and attached to a trusted
   network (e.g. at work), then it is probably best to select the ELI
   quadrant.  These are just some examples of how to use this
   information to select the quadrant.

   Additionally, the information can also be used to trigger subsequent
   changes of MAC address, to enhance location privacy.  Besides,
   changing the SLAP quadrant used might also be used as an additional
   enhancement to make it harder to track the user location.

   Last, if we consider the data center scenario, a hypervisor might
   request local MAC addresses to be assigned to virtual machines.  As
   in the previous scenarios, the hypervisor might select the preferred
   SLAP quadrant using information provided by the cloud management
   system (CMS) or virtualization infrastructure manager (VIM) running
   on top of the hypervisor.  This information might include, but is not
   limited to:

   o  Migratable/non-migratable VM.  If the function implemented by the
      VM is subject to be moved to another physical server or not.  This
      has an impact on the preference for the SLAP quadrant, as some
      quadrants are better suited (e.g., ELI/SAI) for supporting
      migration in a large data center.

   o  VM connectivity characteristics , e.g.,: standalone, part of a
      pool, part of a service graph/chain.  If the connectivity
      characteristics of the VM are known, this can be used by the
      hypervisor to select the best SLAP quadrant.

              Figure 3: DHCPv6 signaling flow (client-server)

   1.  Link-layer addresses (i.e., MAC addresses) are assigned in
       blocks.  The smallest block is a single address.  To request an
       assignment, the client sends a Solicit message with a IA_LL
       option in the message.  The IA_LL option MUST contain a LLADDR
       option.  In order to indicate the preferred SLAP quadrant, the
       IA_LL option includes the new OPTION_QUAD option in the IA-LL-
       option field (with the LLAADR option).

   2.  The server, upon receiving a IA_LL option, inspects its content
       and may offer an address or addresses for each LLADDR option
       according to its policy.  The server sends back an Advertise
       message with an IA_LL option containing an LLADDR option that
       specifies the addresses being offered.  If the server supports
       the new QUAD IA-LL-option, and manages a block of addresses
       belonging to the requested quadrant, the addresses being offered
       SHOULD belong to the requested quadrant.  If the server does not

       have addresses from the requested quadrant, it MUST return the
       IA_LL option containing a Status Code option with status set to
       NoQuadAvail.

   3.  The client waits for available servers to send Advertise
       responses and picks one server as defined in Section 18.2.9 of
       [RFC8415].  The client then sends a Request message that includes
       the IA_LL container option with the LLADDR option copied from the
       Advertise message sent by the chosen server.  It includes the
       preferred SLAP quadrant in the new QUAD IA-LL-option.

   4.  Upon reception of a Request message with IA_LL container option,
       the server assigns requested addresses.  The server MAY alter the
       allocation at this time.  It then generates and sends a Reply
       message back to the client.  Upon receiving a Reply message, the
       client parses the IA_LL container option and may start using all
       provided addresses.  Note that a client that has included a Rapid
       Commit option in the Solicit, may receive a Reply in response to
       the Solicit and skip the Advertise and Request steps above
       (following standard DHCPv6 procedures).

   5.  When the assigned addresses are about to expire, the client sends
       a Renew message.  It includes the preferred SLAP quadrant in the
       new QUAD IA-LL-option, so in case the server is unable to extend
       the lifetime on the existing address(es), the preferred quadrant
       is known for the allocation of any "new" addresses.

   6.  The server responds with a Reply message, including an LLADDR
       option with extended lifetime.

4.2.  Address assignment from the SLAP quadrant indicated by the relay

   We describe next the protocol operations for a relay to select a
   preferred SLAP quadrant using the DHCPv6 signaling procedures
   described in [I-D.ietf-dhc-mac-assign].  This is useful when a DHCPv6
   server is operating over a large infrastructure split in different
   network regions, where each region might have different requirements.
   The signaling flow is shown in Figure 4.

   1.   Link-layer addresses (i.e., MAC addresses) are assigned in
        blocks.  The smallest block is a single address.  To request an
        assignment, the client sends a Solicit message with a IA_LL
        option in the message.  The IA_LL option MUST contain a LLADDR
        option.

   2.   The DHCP relay receives the Solicit message and encapsulates it
        in a Relay-forw message.  The relay, based on local knowledge
        and policies, includes in the Relay-Forw message the QUAD option
        with the preferred quadrant.  The relay might know which
        quadrant to request based on local configuration (e.g., the
        served network contains IoT devices only, thus requiring ELI/

        SAI) or other means such as based on analyzing the Solicit
        message from the client.

   3.   The server, upon receiving the forwarded Solicit message
        including a IA_LL option, inspects its content and decide may
        offer an address or addresses for each LLADDR option according
        to its policy.  The server sends back an Advertise message with
        an IA_LL option containing an LLADDR option that specifies the
        addresses being offered.  This message is sent to the Relay in a
        Relay-reply message.  If the server supports the semantics of
        the preferred quadrant included in the QUAD option, and manages
        a block of addresses belonging to the requested quadrant, then
        the addresses being offered SHOULD belong to the requested
        quadrant.

   4.   The relay sends the received Advertise message to the client.

   5.   The client waits for available servers to send Advertise
        responses and picks one server as defined in Section 18.2.9 of
        [RFC8415].  The client then sends a Request message that
        includes the IA_LL container option with the LLADDR option
        copied from the Advertise message sent by the chosen server.

   6.   The relay forwards the received Request in a Relay-forw message.
        It adds in the Relay-forw a QUAD IA-LL-option with the preferred
        quadrant.

   7.   Upon reception of the forwarded Request message with IA_LL
        container option, the server assigns requested addresses.  The
        server MAY alter the allocation at this time.  It then generates
        and sends a Reply message, in a Relay-reply back to the relay.

   8.   Upon receiving a Reply message, the client parses the IA_LL
        container option and may start using all provided addresses.

   9.   When the assigned addresses are about to expire, the client
        sends a Renew message.

   10.  This message is forwarded by the Relay in a Relay-forw message,
        including a QUAD IA-LL-option with the preferred quadrant.

   11.  The server responds with a Reply message, including an LLADDR
        option with extended lifetime.  This message is sent in a Relay-
        Reply message.

   12.  The relay sends the Reply message back to the client.

5.  DHCPv6 options definitions

5.1.  Quad (IA-LL) option

   The QUAD option is used to specify the preferences for the selected
   quadrants within an IA_LL.  The option must either be encapsulated in
   the IA-LL-options field of an IA_LL option or in a Relay-Forw message
   in the options field.  It MAY also be in a Relay-Reply if the QUAD
   option code was specified in a ERO option [RFC4994].

   The format of the QUAD option is:

       0                   1                   2                   3
