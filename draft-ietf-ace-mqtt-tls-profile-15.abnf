   Topic filters are implemented according to Section 4.7 of MQTT v5.0 -
   the OASIS Standard [MQTT-OASIS-Standard-v5].  By default, Wildcard
   Subscriptions are supported, and so, the topic filter may include
   special wildcard characters.  The multi-level wildcard, '#', matches
   any number of levels within a topic, and the single-level wildcard,
   '+', matches one topic level.  The Broker MAY signal in the CONNACK
   explicitly whether wildcard subscriptions are supported by returning
   a CONNACK property "Wildcard Subscription Available".  A value of 0
   means that Wildcard Subscriptions are not supported.  A value of 1
   means Wildcard Subscriptions are supported.

   Following this model, an example scope may contain:

    [["topic1",["pub","sub"]],["topic2/#",["pub"]],["+/topic3",["sub"]]]

                          Figure 10: Example scope

   This access token gives publish ("pub") and subscribe ("sub")
   permissions to the "topic1", publish permission to all the subtopics
   of "topic2", and subscribe permission to all "topic3", skipping one
   level.

   If the scope is empty, the Broker records no permissions for the
   client for any topic.  In this case, the Client is not able to
   publish or subscribe to any protected topics.  The non-empty scope is
   used to authorize the Will Topic, if provided, in the CONNECT packet,
   during connection setup, and if the connection request succeeds, the
   Topic Names or Topic Filters requested in the future PUBLISH and
   SUBSCRIBE packets.  For the authorization to succeed, the Broker MUST
   verify that the topic name or filter in question is either an an
   exact match to or a subset of at least one 'topic_filter' in the
   scope.
