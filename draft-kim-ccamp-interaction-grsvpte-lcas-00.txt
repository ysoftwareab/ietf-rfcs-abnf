Abstract 
                   
   This document describes interaction aspects between a signaling 
   protocol and LCAS. The signaling protocol handled by IETF could be 
   GMPLS RSVP-TE. GMPLS CR-LDP requires further study for this draft. 
   The LCAS protocol handled by ITU-T is a protocol that is used to 
   change the bandwidth capacity of a virtual concatenated signal used 
   by transport networks (i.e. SDH and OTN), which should be initiated

   only in a unidirection by EMS or NMS systems. However, the GMPLS 
   signaling protocol has a feature of being capable of establishing bi-
   directional connections over a LSP. In current, there is no 
   interaction between the signaling protocol and LCAS. In this document, 
   when a signaling protocol such as GMPLS RSVP-TE and LCAS are used 
   together within a node and the bi-directional connection is requested 
   over the same route, the relevant requirements are identified 
   to help the initiation process of egress node by EMS or 
   NMS systems.

1.5.  Justification of Work 
                   
   The CCAMP WG should consider this document as LCAS is fit for GMPLS 
   and the WG handles GMPLS. In addition, the draft addresses an upgrade 
   of the signaling protocol such as GMPLS RSVP-TE to help the 
   initiation process of egress node by EMS or NMS systems.

3.  Introduction 
    
   As described in [G.7042], LCAS is a link capacity adjustment scheme 
   that should be used to increase or decrease the capacity of a 
   container that is transported in an SDH/OTN network using Virtual 
   Concatenation(VC). The operation of LCAS is unidirectional under 
   control of EMS or NMS systems. This means that in order to bi-
   directionally add or remove members the procedure has to be repeated 
   in the opposite direction. The scheme uses the K4 overhead byte for 
   lower order LCAS of VC-m-Xv (m=11,12,2) and the H4 overhead byte for 
   higher order LCAS of VC-n-Xv (n=3,4) in SDH to exchange control 
   packets. In OTN, the scheme uses VC overhead (VCOH 1/2/3) in the 
   information structure, optical channel payload unit (OPUk, k = 1/2/3). 
   From the view-point of implementation, LCAS is a layer 1 based 
   protocol, differently from signaling protocols. 
                   
   From the view-point of IETF, it is said that the LCAS-related path 
   computation performed by NMS could be performed within a network  
   element as well if routing functions are used to exchange the 
   information of network topology and link status. However, for 
   convenience' sake we assume that the path computation is performed in 
   NMS. 
                   
   As an example using LCAS, we could take the following figure. NMS  
   could initiate an increase or decrease command to indicate addition 
   or deletion of members to the ingress node(Node1) for the downstream 
   direction (links La/e/i) and to the egress node(Node4) for the 
   upstream direction (links Ll/h/d/b) over a LSP.

   We could assume a LSP with a bi-direction of the same route for 
   respective direction. The SONET/SDH based transport network is a 
   typical example. As described in [GMPLS-ARCH], GMPLS allows 
   establishment of bi-directional symmetric LSPs. However, in current, 
   GMPLS signaling protocols have no knowledgement about the LCAS 
   application. As such, although GMPLS signaling protocols have the 
   capability of bi-directional establishment, the ingress and egress 
   nodes have to initiate establishment requests to the respective 
   direction. However, as indicated in [GMPLS-ARCH], these two 
   unidirectional paths have several disadvantages such as latency delay, 
   control overhead, complicated route selection, and so on. 
                   
   This document describes interaction aspects to resolve the 
   inconsistency between a signaling protocol and LCAS .The signaling 
   protocol handled by IETF could be GMPLS RSVP-TE. GMPLS CR-LDP 
   requires further study for this draft. When a signaling protocol such 
   as GMPLS RSVP-TE and LCAS are used together within a node and the bi-
   directional connection is requested over the same route, the relevant 
   requirements are identified to avoid the initiation process of egress 
   node by EMS or NMS systems. 
                   
                   
                   
4. Review of GMPLS RSVP-TE, LMP and LCAS 
                   
   To support the interaction capability between a signaling protocol 
   and LCAS, the GMPLS signaling protocol and link management protocol 
   should provide several functions such as bi-directional LSP 
   establishment, explicit routing, route recoding, component indication 
   of downstream and upstream interfaces, link property correlation, 
   link connectivity verification, and LCAS establishment indication. As 
 
 
Kim, et al                                                    [Page 4] 
Internet    Draft draft-kim-interaction-grsvpte-lcas-00.txt    Nov. 2003 
 
 
   indicated in [GMPLS-ARCH], most of these features have been supported 
   by the signaling protocol and link management protocol except for 
   LCAS establishment indication. 
    
   For examples, As indicated in [RFC3473], a bi-directional LSP setup 
   is indicated by the presence of an Upstream Label in the Path message. 
   Explicit routing about the path taken by an LSP is controlled by 
   using an Explicit Route Object (ERO) in the message. Up-to-date 
   detailed path information on a hop-by-hop basis during the LSP setup 
   process is collected via route recoding mechanism of using Record 
   Route Object (RRO) in [RFC3209]. Component indication of downstream 
   and upstream interfaces is resolved using the IF_ID RSVP_HOP object. 
   In addition, property correlation and connectivity verification about 
   component interfaces connected between a pair of nodes are supported 
   by [LMP]. 
    
   However, the link capacity adjustment scheme had been standardized in 
   Nov. 2001 by ITU-T. As such, the GMPLS signaling protocol still have 
   no opportunity to add LCAS-related feature(s). Here, we could think 
   that how much it is valuable to include LCAS establishment indication 
   into the signaling protocol. If there may be special advantages, it 
   may be no use considering the LCAS establishment indication. To show 
   an example scenario, we will use information flows diagram that are 
   based on the figure above. 
    
   The first situation is not to apply the LCAS establishment indication 
   in the signaling protocol on which requires a bi-directional LSP. The 
   figure shows simple information flows when using GMPLS RSVP-TE as a 
   signaling protocol.

   This figure above is the procedure that is performed after NMS's 
   requests with an Increase command of each direction. Of course, in 
   this diagram more detailed LCAS procedures and GMPLS RSVP-TE 
   procedures are omitted. In addition, Increase commands for the 
   respective downstream (ds) and upstream (us) could be issued at the 
   same time by NMS. The important thing is that the respective 
   direction should apply the own individual LSP procedure. Possible 
   disadvantages in this case are identified in [GMPLS-ARCH]. Another 
   important drawback is difficult to meet real-time protection 
   requirements. 
    
   Then, to avoid the problem we could consider the second situation to 
   use the LCAS establishment indication in the signaling protocol.

   This figure above is the procedure that is performed after NMS's 
   requests with an Increase command for bi-directional establishment. 
   Of course, in this figure as well more detailed LCAS procedures and 
   GMPLS RSVP-TE procedures are omitted. In addition, ADD control 
   packets in the ingress and egress nodes could be issued at a proper 
   time that has nothing to do with the opposite's condition. 
       
       
       
5.  Interaction requirements 
    
   When using the second procedure with the LCAS establishment 
   indication, we could have two considerations, NMS's bi-directional 
   request for LCAS control and definition of LCAS establishment 
   indication. 
    
   For the first consideration, to begin with, we have to exchange 
   opinions between ITU-T and IETF in order to be capable of initiating 
   the LCAS control in a bi-direction at a once only under the 
   assumption that the bi-directional connection is established over the 
   same route and a pair of component interfaces for downstream and 
   downstream traffic.

Internet    Draft draft-kim-interaction-grsvpte-lcas-00.txt    Nov. 2003 
                
                
   For the second consideration, Path message has to include the 
   indication of requesting the initiation of LCAS control to the 
   opposite direction by egress node. If the current specification of 
   GMPLS RSVP-TE would have included relevant object(s) to add the 
   indication, we could resolve the problem statement easily. And, if we 
   wouldn't find out relevant object(s) in the current documents, we 
   could define a new object with the LCAS establishment indication. 
       
   For a example of the first approach, we could consider the extension 
   of ADMIN_STATUS object in [RFC3471]. As indicated in the document, 
   the information is currently used in two ways, for the indication of 
   administrative state with respect to a particular LSP, and for the 
   indication of a request to set an LSP's administrative state. However, 
   it looks like these uses don't fit to the LCAS establishment 
   indication. As such, we could think that its use is extended to 
   include the LCAS establishment indication. 
       
       
       
6.  Proposal of the draft 
    
   Based on the procedures and requirements described above, the draft 
   proposes to include the LCAS establishment indication extending the 
   use of ADMIN_STATUS object as follows: 
    
   In the third usage of Administrative Status Information, the 
   information indicates a request to initiation of LCAS operation to 
   the opposite direction by an egress node.

Security Considerations 
    
   Security issues are not considered in this proposal. However, It 
   looks like that the security considerations mentioned in [RFC3472] or 
   [RFC3473] may be applied in this draft as well.
