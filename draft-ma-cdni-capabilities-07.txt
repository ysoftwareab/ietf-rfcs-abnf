         CDNI Footprint & Capabilities Advertisement Interface
                     draft-ma-cdni-capabilities-07

Abstract

   Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI) is predicated on
   the ability of downstream CDNs (dCDNs) to handle end-user requests in
   a functionally equivalent manner to the upstream CDN (uCDN).  The
   uCDN must be able to assess the ability of the dCDN to handle
   individual requests.  The CDNI Footprint & Capabilities Advertisement
   interface (FCI) is provided for the advertisement of capabilities and
   the footprints to which they apply by the dCDN to the uCDN.  This
   document describes an approach to implementing the CDNI FCI.

1.  Introduction

   The need for footprint and capabilities advertisement in CDNI is
   described in the CDNI requirements document [RFC7337].  Requirements
   FCI-1 and FCI-2 describe the need to allow dCDNs to communicate
   capabilities to the uCDN.  Requirement FCI-3 describes how a uCDN may
   aggregate the footprint and capabilities information for all cascaded
   dCDNs and use the aggregated information in advertisements to CDNs
   further upstream.  This concept of aggregation can apply to both
   organizationally different dCDNs (e.g., other CDN providers, or
   different business units within a larger organization) or logical
   entities within the same CDN (e.g., using multiple request routers
   for scalability reasons, to segregate surrogates based on specific
   protocol support, or to segregate surrogates based on software
   version or feature level, etc.).

   Appendix A contains more detailed descriptions of different footprint
   and capabilities management scenarios, but it is important to note
   that it is the ability of the dCDN to service each request in a
   functionally equivalent manner as the uCDN that is important, not the
   physical layout of resources through which it services the request.
   The aggregation of resource knowledge by the dCDN into a simple set
   of capabilities and their affective footprints, that is then
   advertised to the uCDN, enables efficient decision making at each
   delegation point in the CDN interconnection hierarchy.

   It is assumed that an authoritative request router in each CDN will
   be responsible for aggregating and advertising capabilities
   information in a dCDN, and receiving and aggregating capabilities
   information in the uCDN.  The CDNI Footprint & Capabilities
   Advertisement interface (FCI) along with the CDNI Request Routing
   Redirection interface (RI) [I-D.ietf-cdni-redirection] make up the
   CDNI Request Routing Interface.  As there is no other centralized
   CDNI controller, the authoritative request router seems the most
   logical place for capabilities aggregation to occur, as it is the
   request router that needs such information to make delegation

   decisions.  The protocol defined herein may be implemented as part of
   an entity other than an authoritative request router, but for the
   purposes of this discussion, the authoritative request router is
   assumed to be the centralized capabilities aggregation point.

   Though there is an obvious need for the ability to exchange and
   update footprint and capability information in real-time, it is
   assumed that capabilities do not change very often.  It is also
   assumed that the capabilities are not by themselves useful for making
   delegation decisions.  Capability information is assumed to be input
   into business logic.  It is the business logic which provides the
   algorithms for delegation decision making.  The definition of
   business logic occurs outside the scope of CDNI and outside the
   timescale of footprint and capability advertisement.  It may be the
   case that the business logic anticipates and reacts to changes in
   dCDN capabilities.  However, it may also be the case that business
   logic is tailored through offline processes as dCDN capabilities
   change.  The FCI is agnostic to the business processes employed by
   any given uCDN.  The footprints and capabilities that are advertised
   over the FCI may be used by the uCDN at its discretion to implement
   delegation rules.  Setting proper defaults in the business logic
   should prevent any unwanted delegation from occurring when dCDN
   capabilities change, however, that is beyond the scope of this
   discussion.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in section 1.1 of the CDNI
   Framework [RFC7336] document.

2.  CDNI FCI Capability Advertisement

   The FCI is implemented as an ALTO [RFC7285] Service.  The ALTO
   protocol defines an HTTP-based transport through which ALTO service
   information may be retrieved using either a GET or POST method.  The
   uCDN request router may at any time query the dCDN ALTO FCI Service
   for the full set of dCDN capability information.  The uCDN may use a
   separate FCI Filter Service to retrieve a subset of the dCDN
   capability information.

   [Ed.: Need to update this with ALTO asynchronous update support.]

   [Ed.: Need to update this with ALTO incremental update support.]

2.1.  CDNI FCI Capability Initialization

   In lieu of any out-of-band pre-configured capability information,
   when the FCI is first brought up between a uCDN and a dCDN, the uCDN
   SHOULD assume that the dCDN has no CDNI capabilities.  If an out-of-
   band capability baseline has been exchanged, the uCDN MAY use that
   information to initialize its capabilities database.  In either case,
   the uCDN SHOULD verify the initial state of the dCDN (as a temporary
   outage may affect availability in the dCDN).

   The dCDN MUST support sending its entire set of capabilities to the
   uCDN through the ALTO service interface

   [Ed.: The alternative to using a pull from the uCDN is to use the
   triggers interface for a triggered push, however, this would not be
   triggering a CDN function, it would be triggering an FCI function, so
   given that there is no asynchronous action required by the dCDN, it
   seems that reducing inter-dependency on other CDNI interfaces makes
   the most sense in this case.]

3.  CDNI FCI Capabilities Service

   As described in Requirement FCI-2, there is a basic set of
   capabilities that must be supported by the FCI for the uCDN to be
   able to determine if the dCDN is functionally able to handle a given
   request.  The CDNI Footprint and Capabilities Semantics
   [I-D.ietf-cdni-footprint-capabilities-semantics] document lists
   mandatory capabilities types:

   o  Delivery Protocol

   o  Acquisition Protocol

   o  Redirection Mode

   o  CDNI Logging Capabilities

   o  CDNI Metadata Capabilities

   To be consistent with the base ALTO service definitions, we use the
   JSON object definition notation as specified in the ALTO [RFC7285]
   protocol RFC.

3.1.1.  Media Type

   The media type of CDNI FCI Map is "application/alto-cdni-fcimap+json"

3.1.2.  HTTP Method

   A CDNI FCI Map resource is requested using the HTTP GET method.

3.1.3.  Accept Input Parameters

   None.

3.1.4.  Capabilities

   None.

3.1.5.  Uses

   None.

3.1.6.  Response

   The data component of a CDNI FCI Map resource is named "fcimap" which
   is a JSON object of type FCIMapData:

      object {
         FCIMapData fcimap<0..*>;
      } InfoResourceFCIMap : ResponseEntityBase;

      object {
         JSONString type;
         JSONValue value;
         FCIFootprint footprint<0..*>;
      } FCIMapData;

      object {
         JSONString type;
         JSONString values<1..*>;
      } FCIFootprint;

   The FCIMapData object contains a capability name which identifies the
   capability, a value object containing the associated Capability
   Advertisement Object (e.g., delivery-protocols, acquisition-
   protocols, or redirection-modes, as defined in the CDNI Footprint and
   Capabilities Semantics
   [I-D.ietf-cdni-footprint-capabilities-semantics] document).  The
   FCIMapData object may also contain an optional list of FCIFootprint
   objects.  The FCIFootprint object specifies a footprint type (as

   defined by the CDNI Metadata Footprint Types registry, e.g.,
   IPv4CIDR, IPv6CIDR, ASN, or CountryCode [I-D.ietf-cdni-metadata])
   which identifies the contents and encoding of the individual
   footprint entries contained in the associated values array.

   The footprint restriction list MUST NOT contain multiple footprint
   objects of the same type.  Footprint restriction information MAY be
   specified using multiple different footprint types.  If no footprint
   restriction list is specified (or an empty list is specified), it
   SHALL be understood that all footprint types MUST be reset to
   "global" coverage.

   Note: Further optimization of the footprint object to provide quality
   information for a given footprint is certainly possible, however, it
   is not critical to the basic interconnection of CDNs.  The ability to
   transfer quality information in capabilities advertisements may be
   desirable and is noted here for completeness, however, the specifics
   of such mechanisms are outside the scope of this document.

   Multiple FCIMapData objects with the same capability type are allowed
   within a given CDNI FCI Map response as long as the capability option
   values do not overlap, i.e., a given capability option value MUST NOT
   show up in multiple FCIMapData objects within a single CDNI FCI Map
   response.  If multiple FCIMapData objects for a given capability type
   exist, those capability objects MUST have different footprint
   restrictions; capability objects of a given capability type with
   identical footprint restrictions MUST be combined into a single
   capability object.

3.1.7.  CDNI FCI Capabilities

3.1.7.1.  Delivery Protocol

   The delivery protocol refers to the protocol over which an end user
   (EU) has requested content.  If a dCDN does not support the protocol
   requested by the client, then the dCDN is not a viable candidate for
   delegation.

   Though the delivery protocol is specified in the URI scheme (as
   defined in RFC3986 [RFC3986]) of the client request URL, protocol
   feature subsets or augmented protocol feature sets MAY be defined and
   SHOULD correspond with the protocols listed in the CDNI Metadata
   Protocol Types registry, e.g., HTTP1.1 or HTTPS1.1
   [I-D.ietf-cdni-metadata].

   The delivery protocol capability SHOULD support optional footprint
   restriction information.  The following example shows two lists of
   protocols with different footprints.

            ]
          }
        ]
      }

   In the above example, the HTTP1.1 protocol is supported globally,
   while the HTTPS1.1 protocol is only supported in a restricted
   footprint (in this case, specified by IPv4 prefix).

   A given protocol MUST NOT appear in multiple FCIMapData application/
   cdni.FCI.DeliveryProtocol.v1+json object values.

3.1.7.2.  Acquisition Protocol

   The acquisition protocol refers to the protocol over which an end
   user (EU) has requested content.  If a dCDN does not support the

   protocol requested by the client, then the dCDN is not a viable
   candidate for delegation.

   Though the acquisition protocol is specified in the URI scheme (as
   defined in RFC3986 [RFC3986]) of the client request URL, protocol
   feature subsets or augmented protocol feature sets MAY be defined and
   SHOULD correspond with the protocols listed in the CDNI Metadata
   Protocol Types registry, e.g., HTTP1.1 or HTTPS1.1
   [I-D.ietf-cdni-metadata].

   The acquisition protocol capability SHOULD support optional footprint
   restriction information.  The following example shows two lists of
   protocols with different footprints.

              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }

   In the above example, the HTTP1.1 protocol is supported globally,
   while the HTTPS1.1 protocol is only supported in a restricted
   footprint (in this case, specified by IPv4 prefix).

   A given protocol MUST NOT appear in multiple FCIMapData application/
   cdni.FCI.AcquisitionProtocol.v1+json value objects.

3.1.7.3.  Redirection Mode

   The redirection mode refers to the method(s) employed by request
   routers to perform request redirection.  The CDNI framework [RFC7336]
   document describes four possible request routing modes:

   o  DNS iterative (DNS-I)

   o  DNS recursive (DNS-R)

   o  HTTP iterative (HTTP-I)

   o  HTTP recursive (HTTP-R)

   The CDNI Footprint and Capabilities Semantics
   [I-D.ietf-cdni-footprint-capabilities-semantics] defines the "CDNI
   Capabilities Redirection Modes" registry and the initial supported
   redirection mode values shown in parentheses above.

   If a dCDN supports only a specific mode or subset of modes that does
   not overlap with the modes supported by the uCDN, then the dCDN is
   not a viable candidate for delegation.

   The redirection mode capability SHOULD support optional footprint

   A given mode MUST NOT appear in multiple FCIMapData application/
   cdni.FCI.RedirectionMode.v1+json object values.

3.1.7.4.  Logging Capabilities

   The CDNI Logging interface [I-D.ietf-cdni-logging] document describes
   optional logging fields and functionality which may be optional for a
   dCDN to implement.  If a dCDN does not support certain logging
   parameters which may affect billing agreements or legal requirements
   of the uCDN, then the dCDN is not a viable candidate for delegation.

3.1.7.5.  Metadata Capabilities

   The CDNI Metadata interface [I-D.ietf-cdni-metadata] document
   describes generic metadata types which may be optional for a dCDN to
   implement, but which, if present, are mandatory-to-enforce.  If a
   dCDN does not support certain metadata types which are designated
   mandatory-to-enforce and may affect the correctness or security of
   the content being delivered, then the dCDN is not a viable candidate
   for delegation.

5.  Footprint via ALTO Network Map

5.1.  ALTO Network Maps

   The ALTO Protocol offers an information service "ALTO map service"
   that provides information to ALTO clients in the form of Network Map
   and Cost Map [RFC7285].  As an alternative to the explicit definition
   of a footprint (e.g. with type "IPv4CIDR", see examples above), a
   reference to an ALTO network map can be used to define an FCI
   footprint.  To enable such referencing to ALTO network maps from
   within an CDNI FCI Map JSON object, a new optional footprint type
   'altonetworkmap' is defined (see also Section 6) which has as values
   a URI to an ALTO server that host an ALTO network map of media type
   'application/alto-networkmap+json' (as defined in the ALTO protocol
   specification [RFC7285]), followed by a list of PIDs [RFC7285] within
   that network map.  Parsing and processing of such an ALTO network map
   that expresses an FCI footprint follows the ALTO protocol
   specification [RFC7285].

5.2.  Example ALTO Network Map for CDNI FCI Footprint

   An ALTO client can retrieve a network map of media type 'application/
   alto-networkmap+json' under a given URI (e.g.
   'http://alto.example.com/fcifootprint001') with a GET request for a
   network map as specified in the ALTO protocol [RFC7285].  The
   following network map would convey to a uCDN that the given dCDN
   (which would provide the map) has three footprints called ''south-
   france'', ''germany'', and ''rest'', and provide the corresponding
   IPv4 address ranges for these footprints.  The entry ''cdni-fruit'' :
   [''orange''] in the ''south-france'' footprint is an example of how
   new endpoint types (e.g. proprietary ones that are defined outside
   the CDNI FCI among certain CDNs) could be used in an ALTO network
   map.

5.3.  Example of ALTO Network Map Footprint in FCI Map

   To reference to an ALTO network map as an FCI footprint, the
   FCIFootprint JSON object must be of type 'altonetworkmap' with values
   containing the URI of the ALTO server hosting the network map and a
   list of PID names contained in the network map.  The following
   example shows the CDNI FCI map on delivery protocol capabilities from
   Section 3.1.7.1, with the difference that the footprint for the FCI
   delivery protocol capabilities 'RTMP' and 'HTTPS' is given via a
   reference to an ALTO network map and corresponding PID names.

7.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of security concerns associated with the FCI.  The
   FCI essentially provides configuration information which the uCDN
   uses to make request routing decisions.  Injection of fake capability
   advertisement messages or the interception and discard of real
   capability advertisement messages may be used for denial of service
   (e.g., by falsely advertising or deleting capabilities or preventing
   capability advertisements from reaching the uCDN).  dCDN capability
   advertisements MUST be authenticated by the uCDN to prevent
   unauthorized capability injection.  uCDN FCI servers MUST be
   authenticated by the dCDN to prevent unauthorized interception of
   ALTO messages.  TLS with client authentication SHOULD be used for all
   FCI implementations.  Deployments in controlled environments where
   physical security and IP address white-listing is employed MAY choose
   not to use TLS.

Appendix A.  Capability Aggregation

   The following sections show examples of three aggregation scenarios.
   In each case, CDN-U is the ultimate uCDN and CDN-P is the penultimate
   CDN which must perform capabilities aggregation.

A.1.  Downstream CDN Aggregation

   Figure A1 shows five organizationally different CDNs: CDN-U, CDN-P,
   and CDNS A, B, and C, the dCDNs of CDN-P which are being aggregated.
   Given the setup shown in Figure A1, we can construct a number of use
   cases, based on the coverage areas of each dCDN (i.e., CDNs P, A, B,
   and C).  Note: In all cases, the reachability of the uCDN (i.e., CDN-
   U) is a don't care as it is assumed that the uCDN knows its own
   coverage area and is likely to favor itself in most situations, and
   if it has decided that it needs to delegate to a dCDN, then the only
   relevant question is if the dCDN can handle the request.

              Figure A1: CDNI dCDN Request Router Aggregation

   o  None of the four dCDNs (CDNs P, A, B, and C) have global
      reachability.  In this case, each CDN is likely to advertise
      footprint information with its capabilities, specifying its
      reachability.  When CDN-P advertises capabilities to CDN-U, it may
      advertise the aggregate footprint of itself and CDNs A, B, and C.
      Note: CDN-P MAY exclude any dCDN, and consequently its footprint,
      per its own internal aggregation decision criteria.

Internet-Draft                  CDNI FCI                      March 2015


   o  All four dCDNs (CDNs P, A, B, and C) have global reachability.  In
      this case, none of the CDNs is likely to advertise any footprint
      information as none have any footprint restrictions.  When CDN-P
      advertises capabilities to CDN-U, the aggregate of all global
      reachability is global reachability.

   o  Some of the four dCDNs (CDNs P, A, B, and C) have global
      reachability and some do not.  In this case, even though some
      dCDNs do not have global reachability, the aggregate of some dCDNs
      having global reachability and some not should still be global
      reachability (for the given capability).  When CDN-P advertises
      capabilities to CDN-U, CDN-P may advertise capabilities for which
      at least one dCDN has global reach as being supported with global
      reachability.  It is up to the CDN-P request router to properly
      select a dCDN to process individual client requests and not choose
      a dCDN whose restricted footprint makes it unsuitable for
      delivering the requested content.

A.2.  Internal Request Router Aggregation

   Figure A2 shows CDN-U and CDN-P where CDN-P internally has four
   request routers: the authoritative request router rr0, and three
   other request routers rr1, rr2, and rr3.  The use of multiple request
   routers may be used to distribute request routing load across
   resources, possibly in different geographic regions covered by CDN-P.
   Similar to Figure A1, the setup shown in Figure A2 requires the
   authoritative request router rr0 in CDN-P to aggregate capabilities
   information from downstream request routers rr1, rr2, and rr3.  The
   primary difference between the scenario is that the request routers
   in Figure A2 are logically within the same CDN-P organization.  The
   same reachability scenarios apply to Figure A2 as with Figure A1.

   o  None of the four CDN-P request routers have global reachability.
      In this case, each request router is likely to advertise footprint
      information with its capabilities, specifying its reachability.
      When rr0 advertises capabilities to CDN-U, it may advertise the
      aggregate footprint of itself and rr1, rr2, and rr3.

   o  All four CDN-P request routers have global reachability.  In this
      case, none of the request routers is likely to advertise any
      footprint information as none has any footprint restrictions.
      When rr0 advertises capabilities to CDN-U, the aggregate of all
      global reachability is global reachability.

   o  Some of the four CDN-P request routers have global reachability
      and some do not.  In this case, even though some request routers
      do not have global reachability, the aggregate of some request
      routers having global reachability and some not should still be
      global reachability (for the given capability).  When rr0
      advertises capabilities to CDN-U, CDN-P may advertise capabilities
      for which at least one request router has global reach as being
      supported with global reachability.  It is up to the authoritative
      request router rr0 to properly select from the other request
      routers for any given request, and not choose a request router

      whose restricted footprint makes it unsuitable for delivering the
      requested content.

A.3.  Internal Capability Aggregation

   Figure A3 shows CDN-U and CDN-P where the delivery network of CDN-P
   is segregated by delivery protocol (e.g., RTSP, HTTP, and RTMP).
   Figure A3 differs from Figures A1 and A2 in that request router rr0
   of CDN-P is not aggregating the capabilities advertisements of
   multiple other downstream request routers, but rather it is managing
   the disparate capabilities across resources within its own local CDN.
   Though not every delivery node has the same protocol capabilities,
   the aggregate delivery protocol capabilities advertised by CDN-A may
   include all delivery protocols.  Note, Figure A3 should not be
   construed to imply anything about the coverage areas for each
   delivery protocol.  They may all support the same delivery footprint,
   or they may have different delivery footprints.  It is the
   responsibility of the request router rr0 to properly assign protocol-
   appropriate delivery nodes to individual content requests.  If
   certain protocols have limited reachability, CDN-P may advertise
   footprint restrictions for each protocol.

   It should be noted that though the delivery protocol capability was
   selected for this example, the concept of internal capability
   aggregation applies to all capabilities as discussed below.

                Figure A3: Local CDN Capability Segregation

   Another situation in which physical footprint may not matter in an
   aggregated view has to do with feature support (e.g., new CDNI
   metadata features or new redirection modes).  Situations often arise
   when phased roll-out of software upgrades, or staging network
   segregation result in only certain portions of a CDN's resources
   supporting the new feature set.  The dCDN has a few options in this
   case:

   o  Enforce atomic update: The dCDN does not advertise support for the
      new capability until all resources have been upgraded to support
      the new capability.

   o  Transparent segregation: The dCDN advertises support for the new
      capability, and when requests are received that require the new
      capability, the dCDN request router properly selects a resource
      which supports that capability.

   o  Advertised segregation: The dCDN advertises support for the new
      capability with a footprint restriction allowing the uCDN to make
      delegation decisions based on the dCDN's limit support.

   The level of aggregation employed by the dCDN is likely to vary as
   business relationships dictate, however, the FCI should support all
   possible modes of operation.
