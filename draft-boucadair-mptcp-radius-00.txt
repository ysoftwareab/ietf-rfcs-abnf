      RADIUS Extensions for Network-Assisted Multipath TCP (MPTCP)
                    draft-boucadair-mptcp-radius-00

Abstract

   One of the promising deployment scenarios for Multipath TCP (MPTCP)
   is to enable a Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) that is connected to
   multiple networks (e.g., DSL, LTE, WLAN) to optimize the usage of its
   network attachments.  Because of the lack of MPTCP support at the
   server side, some service providers consider a network-assisted model
   that relies upon the activation of a dedicated function called: MPTCP
   Concentrator.

   This document specifies a new Remote Authentication Dial-In User
   Service (RADIUS) attribute that carries the list of IP addresses that
   allow CPE devices to reach one or multiple MPTCP Concentrators.

1.  Introduction

   One of the promising deployment scenarios for Multipath TCP (MPTCP,
   [RFC6824]) is to enable a Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) that is
   connected to multiple networks (e.g., DSL, LTE, WLAN) to optimize the
   usage of such resources, see for example [RFC4908].  This deployment
   scenario relies on MPTCP proxies located on both the CPE and network
   sides (Figure 1).  MPTCP Proxies deployed in the network play the
   role of traffic concentrator.

                 Figure 1: "Network-Assisted" MPTCP Design

   Within this document, an MPTCP Concentrator (or concentrator) refers
   to a functional element that is responsible for aggregating the
   traffic originated by a group of CPEs.  This element is located in
   the network.  One or multiple concentrators can be deployed in the
   network to assist MPTCP-enabled CPEs to establish MPTCP connections
   via their available network attachments.  On the uplink path, the
   concentrator terminates the MPTCP connections [RFC6824] received from
   its customer-facing interfaces and transforms these connections into
   legacy TCP connections [RFC0793] towards upstream servers.  On the
   downlink path, the concentrator turns the legacy server's TCP
   connection into MPTCP connections towards its customer-facing
   interfaces.

   Both implicit (where a CPE has no specific knowledge of any
   concentrator deployed in the network) and explicit modes are
   considered to steer traffic towards an MPTCP Concentrator.  This
   document focuses on the explicit mode that consists in explicitly
   configuring a CPE with the reachability information of a MPTCP
   concentrator.

   This document specifies a new Remote Authentication Dial-In User
   Service (RADIUS, [RFC2865]) attribute that carries the MPTCP
   Concentrator IP address list (Section 2).  A sample use case is
   described in Section 3.  In order to accommodate both IPv4 and IPv6
   deployment contexts, the same attribute is used to convey an IPv4 or
   IPv6 address.  Note that one or multiple IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses
   may be returned to a requesting CPE.

Internet-Draft              RADIUS for MPTCP                January 2016


   This document assumes that the MPTCP concentrator(s) reachability
   information can be stored in Authentication, Authorization, and
   Accounting (AAA) servers while the CPE configuration is usually
   provided by means of DHCP ([RFC2131][RFC3315]).

   This specification assumes an MPTCP Concentrator is reachable through
   one or multiple IP addresses.  As such, a list of IP addresses can be
   communicated via RADIUS.  Also, it assumes the various network
   attachments provided to an MPTCP-enabled CPE are managed by the same
   administrative entity.

2.  MPTCP RADIUS Attribute

   The RADIUS MPTCP-Concentrator attribute contains the IP address of an
   MPTCP Concentrator that is assigned to a CPE.  Because multiple MPTCP
   Concentrator IP addresses may be provisioned to an authorised CPE
   (that is a CPE entitled to solicit the resources of a concentrator to
   establish MPTCP connections), multiple instances of the MPTCP-
   Concentrator attribute MAY be included; each instance of the
   attribute carries a distinct IP address.

   The format of the MPTCP-Concentrator attribute is shown in Figure 2.
   The fields are transmitted from left to right.

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     Type      |     Length    |          ip-address ...
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      //      ... ip-address          |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                                 Figure 2

   The description of the fields is as follows:

   o  Type: TBA (see Section 6).

   o  Length: 6 or 18.

   o  ip-address: This field may include an IPv4 address (32 bits) or an
      IPv6 address (128 bit) of the MPTCP concentrator.

   The MPTCP-Concentrator attribute MUST NOT include multicast and host
   loopback addresses [RFC6890].  Anycast addresses are allowed to be
   included in an MPTCP-Concentrator attribute.

   The MPTCP-Concentrator Attribute MAY appear in a RADIUS Access-Accept
   packet.  It MAY also appear in a RADIUS Access-Request packet as a
   hint to the RADIUS server to indicate a preference, although the
   server is not required to honor such a hint.

   The MPTCP-Concentrator Attribute MAY appear in a CoA-Request packet.

   The MPTCP-Concentrator Attribute MAY appear in a RADIUS Accounting-
   Request packet.

   The MPTCP-Concentrator Attribute MUST NOT appear in any other RADIUS
   packet.

3.  Sample Use Case

   This section does not aim to provide an exhaustive list of deployment
   scenarios where the use of the RADIUS MPTCP-Concentrator attribute
   can be helpful.  Typical deployment scenarios are described, for
   instance, in [RFC6911].

   Figure 3 shows an example where a CPE is assigned an MPTCP
   Concentrator.  This example assumes that the Network Access Server
   (NAS) embeds both RADIUS client and DHCPv6 server capabilities.

                     Figure 3: Sample Flow Example (1)

   Upon receipt of the DHCPv6 Solicit message from a CPE, the NAS sends
   a RADIUS Access-Request message to the AAA server.  Once the AAA
   server receives the request, it replies with an Access-Accept message
   (possibly after having sent a RADIUS Access-Challenge message and

   assuming the CPE is entitled to connect to the network) that carries
   a list of parameters to be used for this session, and which include
   MPTCP-Concentrator reachability information (namely a list of IP
   addresses).

   The content of the MPTCP-Concentrator attribute is then used by the
   NAS to complete the DHCPv6 procedure that the CPE initiated to
   retrieve information about the MPTCP Concentrator it has been
   assigned.

   Upon change of the MPTCP Concentrator assigned to a CPE, the RADIUS
   server sends a RADIUS CoA message [RFC5176] that carries the RADIUS
   MPTCP-Concentrator attribute to the NAS.  Once that message is
   accepted by the NAS, it replies with a RADIUS CoA ACK message.  The
   NAS replaces the old MPTCP Concentrator with the new one.

   Figure 4 shows another example where a CPE is assigned an MPTCP
   Concentrator, but the CPE uses DHCPv6 to retrieve a list of IP
   addresses of an MPTCP concentrator.

   Some deployments may rely on the mechanisms defined in [RFC4014] or
   [RFC7037], which allows a NAS to pass attributes obtained from a
   RADIUS server to a DHCP server.

4.  Security Considerations

   RADIUS-related security considerations are discussed in [RFC2865].

   MPTCP-related security considerations are discussed in [RFC6824] and
   [RFC6181].

   Traffic theft is a risk if an illegitimate concentrator is inserted
   in the path.  Indeed, inserting an illegitimate concentrator in the
   forwarding path allows to intercept traffic and can therefore provide
   access to sensitive data issued by or destined to a host.  To
   mitigate this threat, secure means to discover a concentrator should
   be enabled.

5.  Table of Attributes

   The following table provides a guide as what type of RADIUS packets
   that may contain these attributes, and in what quantity.

    Access- Access- Access-  Challenge Accounting #   Attribute
    Request Accept  Reject             Request
    0+      0+      0        0         0+         TBA MPTCP-Concentrator

    CoA-Request CoA-ACK CoA-NACK #   Attribute
    0+          0       0        TBA MPTCP-Concentrator

   The following table defines the meaning of the above table entries:

   0  This attribute MUST NOT be present in packet.
   0+ Zero or more instances of this attribute MAY be present in packet.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a new RADIUS attribute type from the IANA
   registry "Radius Attribute Types" located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types:

      MPTCP-Concentrator (TBA)
