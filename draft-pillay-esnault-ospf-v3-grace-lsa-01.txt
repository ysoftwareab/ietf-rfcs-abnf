1. Introduction

   OSPF hitless Restart[HITLESS] describes a mechanism to restart the 
   control plane of an OSPFv2 router which still has its forwarding plane 
   intact with a minimum of disruption to the network.
 
   The methods described in [HITLESS] just work for point to point links
   for OSPF version 3. In [HITLESS] broadcast and point to multipoint links
   use the Interface Address TLV for OSPF version 2 which is inapplicable
   in OSPF version 3. This memo describes the new Grace LSA specific to 
   OSPF version 3. 
   


2. The Grace Link State Advertisement

   The Grace LSA is used by a restarting router to signal its immediate
   neighbors of its intent to undergo hitless restart and requests his 
   neighbors aid. The Grace LSA contain the restarting router grace-period
   and information on the reason of initiating the restart process. The
   neighbors helper role consists of continuing to advertise the restarting
   router as FULL for the specified grace period left regardless of the 
   actual neighbor state.

   In  OSPF version 3, the Designated router is identified by its 
   router-id as opposed to its interface address in OSPF version 2 on a 
   broadcast segment. The Grace LSA for OSPF version 2 carries the 
   interface address of the restarting router for the helper to identify 
   the restarting neighbor per [HITLESS].

   Broadcast and point-to-multi-point segments do not need to carry
   a TLV is added to carry the router ID for a broadcast segment in 
   OSPF version 3 as the Designater Router can be identified for the 
   advertising router of the Grace LSA. In essence, there is no equivalent 
   router-address TLV for OSPF version 3 and it is not needed.

   The Grace LSA body format will remain the same as described in [HITLESS].

2.1 Grace LSA version 3 - LS Type

   A Grace LSA is defined as link-local scope LSA with the LS type equal
   to 0x000b.

   LSA function code  LS Type  Description
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   11                 0x000b  Grace LSA

   The U-bit is set to 0 to indicate that this is a Link Local LSA
   The S2-bit and S1-bit are also both set to 0 to indicate a 
   link-local scope.


2.2 Grace LSA Format

   This grace LSA format is as follows

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |           LS age              |0|0|0|          11             |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                       Link State ID                           |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                    Advertising Router                         |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                    LS sequence number                         |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |        LS checksum            |            Length             |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                                                               |
     +-                            TLVs                             -+
     |                             ...                               |



    The Link State ID of a Grace LSA in OSPF version 2 was defined as 
    3.0.0.0 (Opaque Type of 3 and Opaque ID equal to 0). It is
    desirable to keep the same semantics.

    The format of the TLVs within the body of a Grace LSA is the same as
    the TLV format used by the Traffic Engineering Extensions to OSPF
    [OSPF-TE]. The TLV header consists of a 16-bit Type field and a 16-bit
    length field, and is followed by zero or more bytes of value. The
    length field indicates the length of the value portion in bytes. The
    value portion is padded to four-octet alignment, but the padding is
    not included in the length field.

    The following is the list of TLVs that can appear in the body of a
    grace-LSA. 

    o   Grace Period (Type=1, length=4).  The number of seconds that the
        router's neighbors should continue to advertise the router as
        fully adjacent, regardless of the the state of database
        synchronization between the router and its neighbors. This TLV 
	is mandatory in a Grace LSA.

    o   Hitless restart reason (Type=2, length=1). Encodes the reason
        for the router restart, as one of the following: 0 (unknown), 1
        (software restart), 2 (software reload/upgrade) or 3 (switch to
        redundant control processor). This TLV is mandatory in a
        Grace LSA.

Security Considerations

   The OSPF v3 security mechanisms to prevent tampering and spoofing of 
   LSAs suffice.
