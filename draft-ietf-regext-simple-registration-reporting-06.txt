                     Simple Registration Reporting
           draft-ietf-regext-simple-registration-reporting-06

Abstract

   Domain name registries (the producer) and registrars (the consumer)
   report to each other by sharing bulk information through files.  This
   document creates two IANA registries to establish a standard
   reporting mechanism between domain name registries and registrars.
   The first IANA registry lists standard data elements and their syntax
   for inclusion in the files.  The second IANA registry lists standard
   reports based on the standard data elements.  Each report is a file
   formatted as a CSV file.  The advantage of this reporting mechanism
   is that a report, each file, can be imported by recipients without
   any prior knowledge of their contents, although reporting is enhanced
   with a minimum of knowledge about the files.  The mechanism for the
   distribution of and access of the files is a matter of local policy.

1.  Introduction

   Currently, domain name registry operators (the producer) create and
   set their own domain name registration reports for use by their
   registrars (the consumer).  Among the distinctions that vary by
   producer is the syntax of the data provided, e.g., date formats, and
   the format of the collection of the data provided, e.g., the report
   may be a CSV file that tends to allow for straightforward importation
   or a PDF file that can be problematic to import.  In addition,
   although there are a number of best practice reports that have
   evolved, these are not currently documented as such, which results in
   a fair amount of customization on the part of the consumers to import
   data.

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                 March 2022


   This document standardizes the name and syntax of the data elements
   to be used across all existing domain name registration reports and
   creates an IANA registry of them to facilitate their evolution,
   including adding additional data elements as needed.  In addition, a
   known set of existing standard reports using the aforementioned data
   elements is specified in another IANA registry to facilitate the
   evolution of the reports and adding additional report definitions as
   needed.

   Each report definition MUST use only the data elements defined in the
   data element aforementioned data element registry, including all
   future reports.  Note that a produced report MAY include data
   elements that are not registered, as specified below.  Future reports
   and future data elements may be specified in their own individual
   documents, updating the IANA registries as needed.

   The mechanism for the distribution of and access to the files is a
   matter of local policy.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Data Element Specification

   Data elements are grouped into categories for convenience.  There is
   no other significance to the groupings.

   Each data element conceptually represents the column heading in a
   printed report.  It is a single unit of information that can be
   passed from the producer to the consumer.  The primary purposes of
   the IANA registry of data elements are to ensure that each data
   element is assigned a unique name and that the syntax of each data
   element is specified.

   The name of the data element MUST be unique and this characteristic
   MUST be enforced by the registry.  The name is used in the report
   definition (in the next section) to alert the consumer as to what to
   expect in the file and how to import the data element.  Character
   encoding recommendation for data elements is specified in Section 7.

   The subsections below comprise an initial list of known data elements
   commonly being used between producers and consumers as of the date of
   publication of this document.  The title of the subsection is the
   data element name for the data element.  Data element names in the
   IANA registry MUST be unique and MUST be processed as case
   insensitive.

2.1.  General Information Data Elements

2.4.10.  Client_Contact_ID

   The identifier of the contact object assigned by the registrar and
   MUST conform to "clIDType" specified in RFC 5730 [RFC5730].

3.  Report Definition Specification

   Each report specification conceptually represents a file of comma
   separated values [RFC4180] (commonly called a CSV file) where the
   values are selected from the data elements specified above.  The
   first row of the file is a comma separated list of data element names
   as specified in the data element registry.  The remaining rows of the
   file are the unordered sets of data elements, one set per row, where
   each row is one transaction in the report.

   Each data element in a set conceptually represents the column heading
   in a printed report.

   A consumer MUST be able to receive data elements that are not
   recognized and MAY skip them accordingly, both in the header row and
   in the transaction rows.

   A report is specified in the report registry with two pieces of
   information.  First is the name of the report.  This can be whatever
   is appropriate as defined by the producer of the report.  The name of
   the report MUST be unique and this characteristic MUST be enforced by
   registry.

   Second is the ordered list of data element names of what is included
   in the report.  The data element names MUST be listed in the data
   element registry specified above.  The data element names and the
   data MUST appear in the report in the order listed in the report
   registry.

   The subsections below comprise an initial list of standard reports
   commonly being used between producers and consumers as of the date of
   publication of this document.  The title of the subsection is the
   report name.  The report name in the IANA registry MUST be unique and
   MUST be processed as case insensitive.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This section describes the format of the IANA Registration Report
   Registry, which has two tables described below, and the procedures
   used to populate and manage the registry entries.

4.1.  Report Specification

   This registry uses the "Specification Required" policy described in
   RFC 8126 [RFC8126].  An English language version of the extension
   specification is required in the registry, though non-English
   versions of the specification may also be provided.

   The "Specification Required" policy implies review by a "designated
   expert".  Section 5.2 of RFC 8126 [RFC8126] describes the role of
   designated experts and the function they perform.

4.1.1.  Designated Expert Evaluation Criteria

   A high-level description of the role of the designated expert is
   described in Section 5.2 of RFC 8126 [RFC8126].  Specific guidelines
   for the appointment of designated experts and the evaluation of a
   Registration Report is provided here.

   The IESG SHOULD appoint a small pool of individuals (perhaps 3 - 5)
   to serve as designated experts, as described in Section 5.2 of RFC
   8126 [RFC8126].  The pool should have a single administrative chair
   who is appointed by the IESG.  The designated experts should use the
   existing regext mailing list (regext@ietf.org) for public discussion
   of registration requests.  This implies that the mailing list should
   remain open after the work of the REGEXT working group has concluded.

   The results of the evaluation should be shared via email with the
   registrant and the regext mailing list.  Issues discovered during the
   evaluation can be corrected by the registrant, and those corrections
   can be submitted to the designated experts until the designated
   experts explicitly decide to accept or reject the registration
   request.  The designated experts must make an explicit decision and
   that decision must be shared via email with the registrant and the
   regext mailing list.  If the specification for a data element or
   report is an IETF Standards Track document, no review is required by
   the designated expert.

   Designated experts should be permissive in their evaluation of
   requests for data elements and reports that have been implemented and
   deployed by at least one registry.  This implies that it may indeed
   be possible to register multiple data elements or reports that
   provide the same functionality.  Requests to register data elements
   or reports that have not been deployed should be evaluated with a
   goal of reducing duplication.  A potential registrant who submits a
   request to register a new data element or report that includes
   similar functionality to existing data elements or reports should be
   made aware of the existing data elements and reports.  The registrant
   should be asked to reconsider their request given the existence of

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                 March 2022


   similar data elements or reports.  Should they decline to do so,
   perceived similarity should not be a sufficient reason for rejection
   as long as all other requirements are met.

4.1.2.  Registration Procedure

   The registry contains information describing each registered data
   element or report.  Registry entries are created and managed by
   sending forms to IANA that describe the data element or report for
   the registry entry.

4.1.2.1.  Required Information

   The required information must be formatted consistently using the
   following registration form.  Form field names and values may appear
   on the same line.

4.1.2.1.1.  Data Element Definition

   Name of data element
           MUST be unique within the registry, enforced to be unique,
           and MUST be processed as case insensitive

   Reference document
           MUST define the data element, SHOULD be a URL to a RFC, and
           SHOULD include the section number (or other detailed internal
           document reference), MAY be a URL to any document available
           under equivalent terms

   Registrant
           Will be IESG for initial entries and all Standards Track
           specifications; otherwise as specified by the registran

   Status 
           MUST be one of active, inactive, or unknown

4.1.2.1.2.  Report Definition

   Name of Report
           MUST be unique within the registry, enforced to be unique,
           and MUST be processed as case insensitive

   Document Status
           MUST be one of active, inactive, or unknown

   Reference document
           MUST define the report, SHOULD be a URL to a RFC and SHOULD
           include the section number (or other detailed internal
           document reference), MAY be a URL to any document available
           under equivalent terms

   Registrant
           Will be IESG for initial entries and all Standards Track
           specifications; otherwise as specified by the registrant

   TLD    
           MUST be "ANY" if the report is intended to be generally
           applicable or MAY be any top level domain formatted as
           defined by RFC 5890 [RFC5890] (or comma separated list of
           domains) and each MUST be an A-LABEL if the report is
           intended to have that scope

   Status:active

4.1.2.2.  Registration Processing

   Registrants should send each registration form to IANA with a single
   record for incorporation into the registry.  Send the form via email
   to iana@iana.org or complete the online form found on the IANA web
   site.  The subject line should indicate whether the enclosed form
   represents an insertion of a new record (indicated by the word
   "INSERT" in the subject line) or a replacement of an existing record
   (indicated by the word "MODIFY" in the subject line).  At no time can
   a record be deleted from the registry.  On receipt of the
   registration request, IANA will initiate review by the designated
   expert(s) if appropriate, who will evaluate the request using the
   criteria in Section 4.1.1 in consultation with the regext mailing
   list.

4.1.2.3.  Updating Report Definition Registry Entries

   When submitting changes to existing registry entries, include text in
   the "Notes" field of the registration form describing the change.
   Under normal circumstances, registry entries are only to be updated
   by the registrant.  If the registrant becomes unavailable or
   otherwise unresponsive, the designated expert can submit a
   registration form to IANA to update the registrant information.
   Entries can change state from "Active" to "Inactive" and back again
   as long as state-change requests conform to the processing
   requirements identified in this document.  In addition to entries
   that become "Inactive" due to a lack of implementation, entries for
   which a specification becomes consistently unavailable over time
   should be marked "Inactive" by the designated expert until the

5.  Security Considerations

   This specification does not consider the issues of distribution or
   access to the reports that are created and thus does not introduce
   any new security security concerns that are not already present in
   the local environment in which the report is created.

   A security principle to keep in mind as new reports are developed is
   that it is considered a bad practice to report or disclose security
   information.  In the case of the registration system upon which this
   reporting mechanism is based, the authInfo code is a specific example
   of a data element that SHOULD NOT be included in a report.

6.  Privacy Considerations

   This specification defines a mechanism for creating reports based on
   data in a registration system.  Some of that data is likely to be
   considered personally identifiable information (PII) and thus would
   be subject to privacy protection according to an applicable privacy
   regulation.  It is outside the scope of this specification to address
   those specific concerns.  Implementors are urged to consider these
   issues with their local legal authority and develop appropriate
   requirements for their work.

   As expressly noted in the Introduction, distribution of and access to
   the reports created by this specification is expressly outside the
   scope of this specification.  However, to the extent a report
   contains PII, implementors are urged to consider these issues with
   their local legal authority and develop appropriate requirements for
   their work.

7.  Internationalization Considerations

   The character encoding for the file contents MUST use UTF-8.

   Throughout this document A-LABEL is indicated as a SHOULD and that
   MUST be interpreted as follows.  All domain name labels MUST be in
   A-LABEL format if it is possible to represent it as an A-LABEL,
   otherwise U-LABEL MAY be used.
