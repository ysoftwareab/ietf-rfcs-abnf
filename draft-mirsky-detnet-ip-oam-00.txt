1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture] introduces and explains Deterministic
   Networks (DetNet) architecture.

   Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) protocols are used
   to detect, localize defects in the network, and monitor network
   performance.  Some OAM functions, e.g., failure detection, work in
   the network proactively, while others, e.g., defect localization,
   usually performed on-demand.  These tasks achieved by a combination
   of active and hybrid, as defined in [RFC7799], OAM methods.

   [I-D.mirsky-detnet-oam] lists the functional requirements toward OAM
   for DetNet domain.  The list can further be used for gap analysis of
   available OAM tools to identify possible enhancements of existing or
   whether new OAM tools are required to support proactive and on-demand
   path monitoring and service validation.  Also, the document defines
   the OAM use principals for the DetNet networks with IP data plane.

2.1.  Terminology

   The term "DetNet OAM" used in this document interchangeably with
   longer version "set of OAM protocols, methods and tools for
   Deterministic Networks".

   Underlay Network or Underlay Layer: The network that provides
   connectivity between the DetNet nodes.  MPLS network providing LSP
   connectivity between DetNet nodes is an example of the underlay
   layer.

   DetNet Node - a node that is an actor in the DetNet domain.  DetNet
   domain edge node and node that performs PREF within the domain are
   examples of DetNet node.

2.2.  Keywords

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Active OAM for DetNet Networks with IP Data Plane

   OAM protocols and mechanisms act within the data plane of the
   particular networking layer.  And thus it is critical that the data
   plane encapsulation supports OAM mechanisms in such a way that DetNet
   OAM packets are in-band with a DetNet flow being monitored, i.e.,
   DetNet OAM test packets follow precisely the same path as DetNet data
   plane traffic both for unidirectional and bi-directional DetNet
   paths.

   The DetNet data plane encapsulation in a transport network with IP
   encapsulations specified in [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip].  For the IP
   underlay network, DetNet flows are identified by the 6-tuple that is
   the destination IP address, source IP address, IP protocol, source
   port number, destination port number, and differentiated services
   (DiffServ) code point (DSCP).  Active IP OAM protocols like
   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) [RFC5880] or STAMP
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-stamp], use UDP transport and the well-known UDP port
   numbers as the destination port.  Thus a DetNet node should be able
   to associate an IP DetNet flow with the particular test session to

   ensure that test packets experience the same treatment as the DetNet
   flow packets.

4.  Use of Hybrid OAM in DetNet

   Hybrid OAM methods are used in performance monitoring and defined in
   [RFC7799] as:

      Hybrid Methods are Methods of Measurement that use a combination
      of Active Methods and Passive Methods.

   A hybrid measurement method may produce metrics as close to passive,
   but it still alters something in a data packet even if that is the
   value of a designated field in the packet encapsulation.  One example
   of such a hybrid measurement method is the Alternate Marking method
   (AMM) described in [RFC8321].  One of the advantages of the use of
   AMM in a DetNet domain with IP data plane is that the marking is
   applied to a data flow, thus ensuring that a measured metrics are
   directly applicable to the DetNet flow.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not have any requests for IANA allocation.  This
   section can be deleted before the publication of the draft.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the applicability of the existing Fault
   Management and Performance Monitoring IP OAM protocols, and does not
   raise any security concerns or issues in addition to ones common to
   networking or already documented for the referenced OAM protocols.
