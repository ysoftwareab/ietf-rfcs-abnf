Abstract

   The snoop file format provides a way to store and exchange
   datalink layer packet traces. This document describes extensions
   to this file format to support new media.

1. Introduction

   [RFC1761] defines the snoop file format used to store captured
   network packets for tools that capture, display and interpret
   network traffic. The file format specifies a header containing
   the Datalink Type field that identifies the network's datalink
   type. This document defines new values for this field, as
   well as an IANA registry for future datalink types.

2. New Datalink Types

   In addition to the Datalink Type codes listed in [RFC1761], this
   document defines the following type codes for the corresponding
   media:

                Datalink Type           Code
                -------------           ----

                Fibre Channel           16
                ATM                     17
                ATM Classical IP        18
                IP over Infiniband      26

   The IP over Infiniband packet format is described in [IPoIB].

3. IANA Considerations

   This document creates a new IANA registry named "Snoop Datalink
   Types" to hold the various possible 32-bit (4 octet) snoop datalink
   types. This new registry will hold the values previously defined in
   [RFC1761] and tabulated below:

                Datalink Type           Code
                -------------           ----

                IEEE 802.3              0
                IEEE 802.4 Token Bus    1
                IEEE 802.5 Token Ring   2
                IEEE 802.6 Metro Net    3
                Ethernet                4
                HDLC                    5
                Character Synchronous   6
                IBM Channel-to-Channel  7
                FDDI                    8
                Other                   9

   Additionally, the new registry will also hold the values defined
   above in section 2 of this document.

   All new allocations and assignments to this registry starting
   from code 27 will follow the First Come First Served policy
   outlined in [BCP0026]. Type codes upto 26 not defined by this
   section of the document (10-15 and 19-25) are considered reserved.

4. Security Considerations

   The addition of new datalink type codes to the existing file format
   poses no known security risks.
