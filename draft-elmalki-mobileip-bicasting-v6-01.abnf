A = L3 handoff anticipation (time difference between the start of the
       L3 fast handoff and the moment in which the L2 handoff occurs)
h = L2 handoff time (disconnection time due to L2 handoff)

A  = anticipation time (F-BU is sent from MN at time t-A, where t is
        the time when the MN actually hands-off at L2)
h  = handoff time (L2 only)
D1 = MN to MAP delay (through oAR)
D2 = MN to MAP delay (through nAR)
p =  F-BU and routing table processing time in the MAP and MN

A  = anticipation time (F-BU is sent from MN at time t-A, where t is
        the time when the MN actually hands-off at L2)
h  = handoff time (L2 only)
d  = MN to AR delay (assume constant as MN moves ARs)
L  = oAR to nAR delay
