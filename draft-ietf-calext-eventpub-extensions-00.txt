                draft-ietf-calext-eventpub-extensions-00

Abstract

   This specification introduces a number of new iCalendar properties
   which are of particular use for event publishers and in social
   networking.

   This specification also defines a new STRUCTURED-DATA property for
   iCalendar (RFC 5545) to allow for data that is directly pertinent to
   an event or task to be included with the calendar data.

1.  Introduction

   The currently existing iCalendar standard [RFC5545] lacks useful
   methods for referencing additional, external information relating to
   calendar components.

   This document defines a number of properties referencing such
   external information that can provide additional information about an



Douglass                Expires February 25, 2017               [Page 2]

   iCalendar component.  The intent is to allow interchange of such
   information between applications or systems (e.g., between clients,
   between client and server, and between servers).  Formats such as
   VCARD are likely to be most useful.

   A new property is also defined to support HTML descriptions.  Event
   publishers typically wish to provide more and better formatted
   information about the event.

   Additionally this specification defines a property to allow the
   inclusion of structured data within the iCalendar object itself.  The
   existing properties in iCalendar cover key elements of events and
   tasks such as start time, end time, location, summary, etc.  However,
   different types of events often have other specific "fields" that it
   is useful to include in the calendar data.  For example, an event
   representing an airline flight could include the airline, flight
   number, departure and arrival airport codes, check-in and gate-
   closing times etc.  As another example, a sporting event might
   contain information about the type of sport, the home and away teams,
   the league the teams are in, information about nearby parking, etc.

   Rather than define new iCalendar properties for the variety of event
   types that might occur, it would be better to leverage existing
   "schemas" for such data.  For example, schemas available at
   https://schema.org include different event types.  By using standard
   schemas, interoperability can be improved between calendar clients
   and non-calendaring systems that wish to generate or process the
   data.

   This specification defines a new "STRUCTURED-DATA" iCalendar property
   to allow for direct inclusion of ancillary data whose schema is
   defined elsewhere.  This property includes parameters to clearly
   identify the type of the schema being used so that clients can
   quickly and easily spot what is relevant within the calendar data and
   present that to users or process it within the calendaring system.

   iCalendar does support an "ATTACH" property which can be used to
   include documents or links to documents within the calendar data.
   However, that property does not allow data to be included as a "TEXT"
   value (a feature that "STRUCTURED-DATA" does allow), plus attachments
   are often treated as "opaque" data to be processed by some other
   system rather than the calendar client.  Thus the existing "ATTACH"
   property is not sufficient to cover the specific needs of inclusion
   of schema data.  Extending the "ATTACH" property to support a new
   value type would likely cause interoperability problems.  Thus a new
   property to support inclusion of schema data is warranted.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  Typed References

   The properties defined here can all reference external meta-data
   which may be used by applications to provide enhanced value to users.
   By providing type information as parameters, clients and servers are
   able to discover interesting references and make use of them, perhaps
   for indexing or the presentation of additional related information
   for the user.

   These properties are designed to handle common use cases in event
   publication.  It is generally important to provide information about
   the organizers of such org.bedework.util.jms.events.  Sponsors wish
   to be referenced in a prominent manner.  In social calendaring it is
   often important to identify the active associates in the event, for
   example a school sports team, and the inactive associates, for
   example the parents.

   The [RFC5545] LOCATION property provides only an unstructured single
   text value for specifying the location where an event (or "TODO"
   item) will occur.  This is inadequate for use cases where structured
   location information (e.g. address, region, country, postal code) is
   required or preferred, and limits widespread adoption of iCalendar in
   those settings.

   Using STRUCTURED-LOCATION, information about a number of interesting
   locations can be communicated, for example, parking, restaurants and
   the venue.  Servers and clients can retrieve the objects when storing
   the event and use them to index by geographic location.

   When a calendar client receives a calendar component it can search
   the set of supplied properties looking for those of particular
   interest.  The TYPE and FMTTYPE parameters, if supplied, can be used
   to help the selection.

2.1.  Use Cases

   The main motivation for these properties has been event publication
   but there are opportunities for use elsewhere.  The following use
   cases will describe some possible scenarios.

2.1.1.  Piano Concert Performance

   In putting together a concert there are many associates: piano tuner,
   performer, stage hands etc.  In addition there are sponsors and
   various contacts to be provided.  There will also be a number of
   related locations.  A number of events can be created, all of which
   relate to the performance in different ways.

   There may be an iTip meeting request for the piano tuner who will
   arrive before the performance.  Other members of staff may also
   receive meeting requests.

   An event can also be created for publication which will have an
   ASSOCIATE reference to the pianist providing vcard information about
   the performer.  This event would also hold information about parking,
   local subway stations and the venue itself.  In addition, there will
   be sponsorship information for sponsors of the event and perhaps paid
   sponsorship properties essentially advertising local establishments.

2.1.2.  Itineraries

   These properties also provide opportunities for the travel industry.
   When booking a flight the ASSOCIATE property can be used to provide
   references to businesses at the airports and to car hire businesses
   at the destination.

   The embedded location information can guide the traveller at the
   airport or to their final destination.  The contact information can
   provide detailed information about the booking agent, the airlines
   and car hire companies and the hotel.

3.  Modifications to Calendar Components

   The following changes to the syntax defined in iCalendar [RFC5545]
   are made here.  New elements are defined in subsequent sections.

4.  New Property Parameters

   This specification makes use of the LABEL property parameter which is
   defined in [I-D.ietf-calext-extensions]

4.1.  Loctype

   Parameter name:  LOCTYPE

   Purpose:  To specify the type of location.

   Format Definition:

   This parameter is defined by the following notation:

     loctypeparam   = "LOCTYPE" "=" param-value

Internet-Draft  Event Publishing Extensions to iCalendar     August 2016


   Description:  This parameter MAY be specified on STRUCTURED-LOCATION
      and provides a way to differentiate multiple properties.  For
      example, it allows event producers to provide location information
      for the venue and the parking.

      Values for this parameter are taken from the values defined in
      [RFC4589].  New location types SHOULD be registered in the manner
      laid down in that specification

4.2.  Assoctype

   Parameter name:  ASSOCTYPE

   Purpose:  To specify the type of associate.

   Format Definition:

   This parameter is defined by the following notation:

     assoctypeparam   = "ASSOCTYPE" "=" param-value

   Description:  This parameter MAY be specified on the ASSOCIATE
      property, and defines the type of association.  Allowable values
      are defined in Section 6.

4.3.  Restype

   Parameter name:  RESTYPE

   Purpose:  To specify the type of resource.

   Format Definition:

   This parameter is defined by the following notation:

     restypeparam   = "RESTYPE" "=" param-value

   Description:  This parameter MAY be specified on STRUCTURED-RESOURCE
      and provides a way to differentiate multiple properties.

      Values for this parameter are taken from the values defined in
      [todo].  New resource types SHOULD be registered in the manner
      laid down in that specification

Internet-Draft  Event Publishing Extensions to iCalendar     August 2016


4.4.  Order

   Parameter name:  ORDER

   Purpose:  To define ordering for the associated property.

   Format Definition:

   This parameter is defined by the following notation:

  orderparam    = "ORDER" "=" integer ;Must be greater than or equal to 1

   Description:  The ORDER parameter is OPTIONAL and is used to indicate
      the relative ordering of the corresponding instance of a property.
      Its value MUST be an integer greater than or equal to 1 that
      quantifies the order.  Lower values correspond to a higher level
      of ordering, with 1 being the highest.

      When the parameter is absent, the default MUST be to interpret the
      property instance as being at the lowest level of ordering.

      Note that the value of this parameter is to be interpreted only in
      relation to values assigned to other corresponding instances of
      the same property in the same entity.  A given value, or the
      absence of a value, MUST NOT be interpreted on its own.

      This parameter MAY be applied to any property that allows multiple
      instances.

4.5.  Schema

   Parameter Name:  SCHEMA

   Purpose:  To specify the schema used for the content of a
      "STRUCTURED-DATA" property value.

   Format Definition:

   This parameter is defined by the following notation:

     schemaparam    = "SCHEMA" "=" DQUOTE uri DQUOTE

   Description:  This property parameter SHOULD be specified on
      "STRUCTURED-DATA" properties.  When present it provides
      identifying information about the nature of the content of the
      corresponding "STRUCTURED-DATA" property value.  This can be used
      to supplement the media type information provided by the "FMTTYPE"
      parameter on the corresponding property.

5.  New Properties

5.1.  Associate

   Property name:  ASSOCIATE

   Purpose:  This property provides a typed reference to external
      information about associates in an event or optionally a plain
      text typed value.

   Value type:  The default value type for this property is URI.  The
      value type can also be set to TEXT to indicate plain text content.

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard, label, assoctype, order or format
      type parameters can be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property MAY be specified in any iCalendar
      component.

   Description:  When used in a component the value of this property
      points to information about an event associate.  This is NOT an
      attendee in a scheduling sense and the ATTENDEE property may in
      fact be specified in addition.  Associates in events can be
      individuals or organizations, for example a soccer team, the
      spectators, or the musicians.

   This property is defined by the following notation:

     associate     = "ASSOCIATE" assocparam
                       (
                         (
                           ";" "VALUE" "=" "URI"
                           ":" uri
                         )  /
                         (
                           ";" "VALUE" "=" "TEXT"
                           ":" text

                     ; the following are OPTIONAL
                     ; but MUST NOT occur more than once
                     ;
                     (";" fmttypeparam) /
                     (";" labelparam) /
                     (";" orderparam) /
                     (";" assoctypeparam) /
                     ;
                     ; the following is OPTIONAL
                     ; and MAY occur more than once
                     ;
                     (";" other-param)
                     ;
                     )


   Note:  When the ORDER parameter is supplied it defines the ordering
      of ASSOCIATE properties with the same value for the TYPE
      parameter.

   Example:

   The following is an example of this property.  It points to a VCARD
   providing information on an event associate.

                    ASSOCIATE;ASSOCTYPE=PRINCIPAL_PERFORMER:

   The following is an example referring to a VCARD providing
   information on the primary contact.

                    ASSOCIATE;FMTTYPE=text/vcard;
                      ASSOCTYPE=PRIMARY-CONTACT;LABEL=A contact:
                      http://dir.example.com/vcard/contacts/contact1.vcf

   Example:

   The following is an example of the property used to link to VCARD
   information on the event planner.

                    ASSOCIATE;FMTTYPE=text/vcard;
                      ASSOCTYPE=PLANNER-CONTACT;LABEL=ClownsIsUs:
                      http://dir.example.com/vcard/clowns-is-us.vcf

5.2.  Styled-Description

   Property name:  STYLED-DESCRIPTION

   Purpose:  This property provides for one or more rich-text
      descriptions to replace or augment that provided by the
      DESCRIPTION property.

   Value type:  There is no default value type for this property.  The
      value type can be set to URI or TEXT.  Other text-based value
      types can be used when defined in the future.  Clients MUST ignore
      any properties with value types they do not understand.

   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard, id, alternate text
      representation, and language property parameters can be specified
      on this property.

   Conformance:  The property can be specified multiple times in the
      "VEVENT", "VTODO", "VJOURNAL", or "VALARM" calendar components.

   Description:  This property is used in the "VEVENT" and "VTODO" to
      capture lengthy textual descriptions associated with the activity.
      This property is used in the "VJOURNAL" calendar component to
      capture one or more textual journal entries.  This property is
      used in the "VALARM" calendar component to capture the display
      text for a DISPLAY category of alarm, and to capture the body text
      for an EMAIL category of alarm.

      VALUE=TEXT is used to provide rich-text variants of the plain-text
      DESCRIPTION property.

Internet-Draft  Event Publishing Extensions to iCalendar     August 2016


      VALUE=URI is used to provide a link to rich-text content which is
      expected to be displayed inline as part of the event.

      The intent of this property is limited to providing a styled and/
      or language specific version of the DESCRIPTION property.  The URL
      property should be used to link to websites or other related
      information.

      Applications MAY attempt to guess the media type of the resource

8.  Security Considerations

   Applications using these properties need to be aware of the risks
   entailed in using the URIs provided as values.  See [RFC3986] for a
   discussion of the security considerations relating to URIs.

   Security considerations relating to the "ATTACH" property, as
   described in [RFC5545], are applicable to the "STRUCTURED-DATA"
   property.

9.  Privacy Considerations

   Properties with a "URI" value type can expose their users to privacy
   leaks as any network access of the URI data can be tracked.  Clients
   SHOULD NOT automatically download data referenced by the URI without
   explicit instruction from users.  This specification does not
   introduce any additional privacy concerns beyond those described in
   [RFC5545].
