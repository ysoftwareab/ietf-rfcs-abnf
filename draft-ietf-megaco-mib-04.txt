  Abstract 
      
     This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use 
     with network management protocols in the Internet community.  In particular, it 
     defines objects for use by the MEGACO/H.248 protocol operating on Media 
     Gateways and Media Gateway Controllers. These objects can be used to manage the 
     network containing Media Gateways and Media Gateway Controllers. 
      
     This new version of the draft is an entire rework of the old version. Most of 
     the missing MIB objects have been added to cover all the aspects of the 
     entities being managed. The number of objects is kept at a minimum to ensure 
     the easy implementation. For backward compatibility, some of the old objects 
     are also retained.

  1. Overview 
      
     The MEGACO/H.248 protocol [3] [4] defines communication between the elements of 
     a physically decomposed multimedia gateway. Those elements are the Media 
     Gateway Controller (MGC) and the Media Gateway (MG). This MIB defines objects 
     on these elements that are to be used to configure these elements such as 
     through control of variable settings, to gather and report management 
     statistics, and to report the occurrence of system management events (i.e., 
     traps) to the network management system. 
      
     This MIB is defined as per the concepts and specifications of the SNMP 
     Management Framework, which consists of 5 parts as follows. 
      
        .  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [5]. 
   
        .  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the purpose 
           of management.  The first version of this Structure of Management 
           Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, RFC 1155 [6], 
           STD 16, RFC 1212 [7] and RFC 1215 [8].  The second version, called 
           SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [9], STD 58, RFC 2579 [10] and 
           STD 58, RFC 2580 [11]. 
   
        .  Message protocols for transferring management information.  The first 
           version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in 
           STD 15, RFC 1157 [12].  A second version of the SNMP message protocol, 
           which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and 
           described in RFC 1901 [13] and RFC 1905 [14].  The third version of the 
           message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 2570 [15], RFC 
           2573 [16] and RFC 2575 [17]. 
   
        .  Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The first set 
           of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in STD 
           15, RFC 1157 [12].  A second set of protocol operations and associated 
           PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [14]. 
   
        .  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [16] and the 
           view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 [17]. 
      
     A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework can be 
     found in RFC 2570 [15].

     Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the 
     Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are defined using the 
     mechanisms defined in the SMI. 
      
     This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A MIB 
     conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate translations.  
     The resulting translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except where 
     objects or events are omitted because no translation is possible (use of 
     Counter64).  Some machine readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into 
     textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this 
     loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the semantics 
     of the MIB.

  3. Security Considerations 
      
     In order to implement this MIB, a probe must capture all packets   on the 
     ocally-attached network, including packets between third parties.  These 
     packets are analyzed to collect network addresses, protocol usage information, 
     and conversation statistics. Data of   this nature may be considered sensitive 
     in some environments. In such environments the administrator may wish to 
     restrict SNMP access to the probe. 
      
     This MIB also includes functions for returning the contents of captured 
     packets, potentially including sensitive user data or passwords. It is 
     recommended that SNMP access to these functions be restricted. 
      
     There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that    have a 
     MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects may be 
     considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The support 
     for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper protection can 
     have a negative effect on network operations. 
      
     SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network itself is 
     secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is  no control as to who 
     on the secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET 
     (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB. 
      
     It is recommended that the implementors consider the security features as 
     provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the  use of the User-based

     Security Model RFC 2574 [18] and the View- based Access Control Model RFC 2575 
     [17] is recommended. 
      
     It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving 
     access to an instance of this MIB, is properly configured to give access to the 
     objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed 
     GET or SET change/create/delete) them.
