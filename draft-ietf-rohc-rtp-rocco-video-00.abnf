SeqNr = SEQR *7 + SEQ7

TS = TSQ * PCTSI + TSR

TS    = RTP timestamp
PCTSI = Picture Clock Interval in TimeStamp ticks. Example: 3600
           for 25 Hz picture clock frequency (90000/25 = 3600).
TSQ   = Timestamp quotient. The integer part after the division.
TSR   = Timestamp residual. TSR = TS modulo PCTSI.

TSC = Predefined TimeStamp delta Codes
                      00 = 3000
                      01 = 3003
                      10 = 3600
                      11 = other, followed by a 2 octet TS delta field
                           after the TS LSB field
