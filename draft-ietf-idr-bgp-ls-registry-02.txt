Updates to the Allocation Policy for the Border Gateway Protocol - Link

Abstract

   RFC 7752 defines Border Gateway Protocol - Link State (BGP-LS).  IANA
   created a registry consistent with that document called the "Border
   Gateway Protocol - Link State (BGP-LS) Parameters Registry" with a
   number of sub-registries.  The allocation policy applied by IANA for
   those registries is "Specification Required" as defined in RFC 8126.

   This document updates RFC 7752 by changing the allocation policy for
   all of the registries to "Expert Review" and by updating the guidance
   to the Designated Experts.

1.  Introduction

   Border Gateway Protocol - Link State (BGP-LS) [RFC7752] requested
   IANA to create a registry called the "Border Gateway Protocol - Link
   State (BGP-LS) Parameters Registry" with a number of sub-registries.
   The allocation policy applied by IANA for those registries is
   "Specification Required" as defined in [RFC8126].

   The "Specification Required" policy requires evaluation of any
   assignment request by a "Designated Expert" and guidelines for any
   such experts are given in section 5.1 of [RFC7752].  In addition,
   this policy requires that "the values and their meanings must be
   documented in a permanent and readily available public specification,
   in sufficient detail so that interoperability between independent
   implementations is possible" [RFC8126].  Further, the intention
   behind "permanent and readily available" is that "a document can
   reasonably be expected to be findable and retrievable long after IANA
   assignment of the requested value" [RFC8126].

   Another allocation policy called "Expert Review" is defined in
   [RFC8126].  This policy also requires Expert Review, but has no
   requirement for a formal document.

   All reviews by Designated Experts are guided by advice given in the
   document that defined the registry and set the allocation policy.

   This document updates RFC 7752 by changing the allocation policy for
   all of the registries to "Expert Review" and updating the guidance to
   the Designated Experts.

Internet-Draft           BGP-LS Registry Update            December 2020


1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains a registry called the "Border Gateway Protocol - Link
   State (BGP-LS) Parameters Registry".  This registry contains four
   sub-registries:

   o  BGP-LS NLRI-Types

   o  BGP-LS Node Descriptor, Link Descriptor, Prefix Descriptor, and
      Attribute TLVs

   o  BGP-LS Protocol-IDs

   o  BGP-LS Well-Known Instance-IDs

   IANA is requested to change the assignment policy for each of these
   registries to "Expert Review".

2.1.  Guidance for Designated Experts

   Section 5.1 of [RFC7752] gives guidance to Designated Experts.  This
   section replaces that guidance.

   In all cases of review by the Designated Expert (DE) described here,
   the DE is expected to check the clarity of purpose and use of the
   requested code points.  The following points apply to the registries
   discussed in this document:

   1.  Application for a codepoint allocation MAY be made to the
       Designated Experts at any time.

   2.  The Designated Experts SHOULD only consider requests that arise
       from I-Ds that have already been accepted as Working Group
       documents or that are planned for progression as AD Sponsored
       documents in the absence of a suitably chartered Working Group.

   3.  In the case of Working Group documents, the Designated Experts
       SHOULD check with the Working Group chairs that there is
       consensus within the Working Group to make the allocation at this
       time.  In the case of AD Sponsored documents, the Designated

Internet-Draft           BGP-LS Registry Update            December 2020


       Experts SHOULD check with the AD for approval to make the
       allocation at this time.

   4.  If the document is not adopted by the IDR Working Group (or its
       successor), the Designated Expert SHOULD notify the IDR mailing
       list (or its successor) of the request and allow two weeks for
       any response.  Any comments received SHOULD be considered by the
       Designated Expert as part of the subsequent step.

   5.  The Designated Experts SHOULD then review the assignment requests
       on their technical merit.  The Designated Experts SHOULD NOT seek
       to overrule IETF consensus, but they MAY raise issues for further
       consideration before the assignments are made.

   6.  The Designated Expert MUST attempt to ensure that any request for
       a code point does not conflict with work that is active or
       already published within the IETF.

   7.  Once the Designated Experts have granted approval, IANA will
       update the registry by marking the allocated codepoints with a
       reference to the associated document.

   8.  In the event that the document fails to progress to RFC, the
       Working Group chairs or AD SHOULD contact the Designated Expert
       to coordinate with IANA over marking the code points as
       deprecated following similar principles to Section 3.3 of
       [RFC7120].

3.  Security Considerations

   The security consideration of [RFC7752] still apply.

   Note that the change to the expert review guidelines makes the
   registry and the Designated Experts slightly more vulnerable to
   denial of service attacks through excessive and bogus requests for
   code points.  It is expected that the registry cannot be effectively
   attacked because the Designated Experts would, themselves, fall to
   any such attack first.  Designated Experts are expected to report to
   the IDR working group chairs and responsible Area Director if they
   believe an attack to be in progress, and should immediately halt all
   requests for allocation.  This may temporarily block all legitimate
   requests until mitigations have been put in place.

4.  Acknowledgements
