   well as IPv6 over Ethernet in an access network deploying the IEEE
   802.16 cellular radio transmission technology.  The Ethernet on top
   of IEEE 802.16 is realized by bridging between point-to-point radio
   links, which are provided by IEEE 802.16 between the base station and

   its associated subscriber stations.  Due to the resource constraints
   of radio transmission systems and the limitations of the IEEE 802.16
   MAC functionality for the realization of an Ethernet, the
   transmission of IP over Ethernet over IEEE 802.16 may considerably
   benefit by adding IP specific support functions in the Ethernet over
   IEEE 802.16 while maintaining full compatibility with standard IP
   over Ethernet behavior.

1.  Introduction

   IEEE 802.16 [IEEE802.16] defines a PMP (Point-to-Multipoint) radio
   transmission system connecting a BS (Base Station) with multiple SSs
   (Subscriber Stations).  IEEE 802.16e [IEEE802.16e] amends the base
   specification with PHY and MAC functions for supporting mobile
   terminals while adopting the same data link principles also for
   mobile networking systems.

   Ethernet is a widely deployed transmission technology.  It provides
   unicast transport, handles broadcast and multicast traffic
   efficiently and provides rich services such as Virtual LANs.
   However, Ethernet has been originally architected and designed for a
   shared medium without special considerations for advanced wireless
   transmission systems.  The focus on wired systems requires additional
   support functions when Ethernet is employed in the IEEE 802.16.

   This document describes the transmission of IPv4 over Ethernet as
   well as IPv6 over Ethernet in an access network deploying the IEEE
   802.16 cellular radio transmission technology.  The Ethernet on top
   of IEEE 802.16 is realized by bridging between the point-to-point
   radio links, which are provided by IEEE 802.16 between the BS and its
   associated SSs.

   With the resource constraints of radio transmission systems and the
   particularities of the IEEE 802.16 MAC for the realization of
   Ethernet, it makes sense to add IP specific support functions in the
   Ethernet layer above IEEE 802.16 while maintaining full compatibility
   with standard IP over Ethernet behavior.  Those IP specific support
   functions are preferable realized in a centralized device containing
   also the bridge for aggregation of traffic from all the BSs to
   provide a more straightforward management solution and allow for
   effectively commoditized BSs, which are deployed in the IEEE 802.16
   based access network in large volume.

4.  The IEEE 802.16 Link Model

4.1.  Connection Oriented Air Interface

   The IEEE 802.16 MAC establishes multiple connections between a BS and
   its associated SSs for the transfer of user data over the air.  Each
   of these connections realize an individual Service Flow which is
   identified by a 16 bit CID number and has a defined QoS profile.

   Multiple connections can be established between a BS and a SS, each
   with its particular QoS class and direction.  Although the BS and all
   the SS are associated with unique 48-bit MAC addresses, packets going
   over the air are only identified in the IEEE 802.16 MAC header by the
   CID number of the particular connection.  The connections are
   established by MAC management messages between the BS and the SS
   during network entry or also later on demand.  Unique cryptographic
   keys are generated during the initial authentication phase between
   the BS and each of the associated SSs to protect the data
   transmission over the air.

   While uplink connections from the SSs to the BS provide only unicast
   transmission capabilities, downlink connections can be used for
   multicast transmission to a group of SSs as well as unicast
   transmission from the BS to a single SS.  The use of multicast CIDs
   for realizing mulicast transmissions, however, is depreciated because
   of the reduced transmission efficiency in smaller groups and the
   complexity of the management of mulitcast CIDs in the BSs as well as
   in the SSs.

   Appendix A provides an overview about the issues arising with
   multicast CIDs in IEEE 802.16 systems.

4.2.  Feeding User Data into the Appropriate Connections

   Assignment of higher layer packets to particular Service Flows and
   related CIDs is performed by the convergence sublayer within the IEEE
   802.16 MAC.  It classifies the packets depending of the values in the
   defined set of the payload packet header fields and assigns the
   packets to the appropriate Service Flow.

   To enable the transmission of different kind of payloads over IEEE
   802.16, multiple convergence sublayers are defined, each specific for
   one kind of payload packet type, like Ethernet, IPv4, IPv6 or even
   for encapsulated payload, like IPv4 over Ethernet or IPv6 over
   Ethernet.

4.3.  MAC addressing in IEEE 802.16

   The 48-bit unique MAC address of a SS is used during the initial
   ranging process for the identification of a SS and is verified by the
   succeeding PKMv2 authentication phase.  Out of the successful
   authentication, the BS establishes and maintains the list of attached
   SSs based on their MAC addresses purely for MAC management purposes.

   While MAC addresses are assigned to all the SSs as well as to the BS
   the forwarding of packets over the air is performed only on base of
   the CID value.  Not relying on the MAC addresses in the payload for
   reception of a radio frame allows for the transport of arbitrary
   source and destination MAC addresses in Ethernet frames between a SS
   and its BS.  This is beneficial when Ethernet frames with arbitrary
   MAC addresses have to be forwarded to an SS in the case that the SS
   contains an Ethernet bridge for a network behind the SS.

   Due to the managed assignment of the service flows and associated CID
   values to individual SSs, the BS is able to bundle all connections
   belonging to a particular SS to a single link towards the bridge on
   the network side to provide plain layer 2 forwarding behaviour in the
   BS between the radio link towards the SS and its associated wired
   link on the network side.


5.  Ethernet Network Model for IEEE 802.16

5.1.  IEEE 802.16 Ethernet Link Model

   According to [I-D.ietf-ipv6-rfc2461bis], an IP Link is defined as a
   communication facility or medium over which nodes can communicate at
   the link layer, i.e. the layer immediately below IP.  IEEE 802.16
   provides point-to-point connections between SSs and the BS but does
   not enable any direct SS to SS connectivity.

Internet-Draft           IPoEth over IEEE 802.16               July 2007


   Ethernet is realized over IEEE 802.16 by implementing bridging
   according to [IEEE802.1D] and its amendment [IEEE802.16k] between all
   SSs based on the IEEE 802.16 Ethernet link model, which provides
   point-to-point connections between the hosts and the bridge behind
   the BS as shown in Figure 2.  This is equivalent to today's switched
   Ethernet with twisted pair wires connecting the hosts to a bridge
   ("Switch").In the IEEE 802.16 Ethernet link model, the BS forwards
   the radio links into wired links towards the bridge.  Separation of
   multiple links on the connection between the BS and the bridge can be
   achieved by deploying flow identifiers (e.g.  VLAN-IDs or GRE KEYS)
   on the wired path.

   The BS SHALL forward all the Service Flows belonging to one SS to one
   radio side port of a bridge according to [IEEE802.1D] and its
   amendment [IEEE802.16k] behind the BSs.  No more than one SS SHALL be
   connected to one port of the bridge.

   The bridge SHOULD be able to create a new port whenever a new SS
   attaches to any of the BSs of the network or to remove a port when an
   associated SS detaches from the network.

   If the SS functions as a bridge for multiple hosts behind the SS
   (i.e.  SS#4 in the below figure) then the SS SHOULD support bridging
   according to [IEEE802.1D] and its amendment [IEEE802.16k] between all
   its LAN ports and the IEEE 802.16 air link.

5.2.  Ethernet without Native Broadcast and Multicast Support

   Current IEEE 802.16 [IEEE802.16][IEEE802.16e] does not define
   broadcast and multicast of IP packets.  Also, MBS (Multicast and
   Broadcast Service as specified in 6.3.23 of [IEEE802.16e]) does not
   cover IP broadcast or multicast data because MBS is invisible to IP
   layer.  Furthermore MBS has severe radio and management issues, as
   discussed in Appendix A.  Hence IP broadcast and multicast packets
   SHOULD be replicated and then carried via unicast transport
   connections as IEEE 802.16 access link.  As specified in Section 6,
   the bridge performs the replication and forwarding.

5.3.  Segmenting the Ethernet into VLAN

   It is possible to restrict the size and coverage of an IP link by
   segmenting the Ethernet and grouping subsets of hosts into VLANs.
   Therefore, the bridge behind the BSs MAY be enabled to support VLANs
   according to [IEEE802.1Q] by assigning and handling the VLAN- IDs of
   the virtual bridge ports.

   If a SS itself contains a VLAN enabled bridge or is directly
   connected to a bridge supporting VLANs, the port associated with such
   a SS MAY be enabled as trunk port.  On trunk ports, Ethernet frames
   are forwarded in the [IEEE802.1Q] frame format.

5.4.  Deployment Scenarios for IP over Ethernet over IEEE 802.16

   This section discusses the two possible deployment scenarios in case
   of IP over Ethernet over IEEE 802.16: Public Access scenario and
   Enterprise LAN scenario.

   In both scenarios, an AR is connected to a bridge, which is connected
   to all BSs.  The bridge acts as aggregation point for all the
   connections from SSs.  Multiple ARs can exist on a link, and an IP
   Link may consist of multiple hosts either being co-located with a SS
   or behind a SS connected to a bridge.  The network behind a SS can
   support various access network technologies, e.g. 802.3, 802.11 or
   802.15.

   There is a big difference between the scenarios in terms of the
   service provider policies.  The difference is also reflected in
   Section 6.2 and Section 8.

5.4.1.  Public Access Scenario

   In the Public Access scenario, direct communication between nodes is
   restricted because of security and accounting issues.  Figure 3
   depicts the public access scenario.

Internet-Draft           IPoEth over IEEE 802.16               July 2007


   In the scenario, the AR is connected to a network side port of the
   bridge behind the BSs.  The bridge SHOULD forward all packets
   received from any radio side port to all network side ports being in
   the forwarding state.  Peer-to-peer communication SHOULD NOT be
   supported by the bridge and all packets originated from a SS SHOULD
   be delivered to an AR.  The AR SHOULD perform security filtering,
   policing and accounting of all traffic from hosts, e.g. like a NAS
   (Network Access Server).

   While the bridge forces all traffic from hosts to reach the AR, it
   still performs Learning Process and maintains Filtering Database as
   specified in [IEEE802.1D] and then forwards IP unicast packets from
   the AR based on the Filtering Database.  However, IP broadcast and
   multicast packets SHOULD be treated with special rules as stated in
   Section 6.1.

   The enterprise LAN scenario assumes trust relationship between all
   hosts and thus enables hosts to directly communicate with each other
   without detouring.  Multiple ARs may be connected to a link, and ARs

   the bridge behind the BSs as well as behind a SS connected to a

6.  Bridge Considerations

   This section discusses operations of the bridge behind the BSs

6.1.  Multicast and Broadcast Packet Processing

   All multicast and multicast control messages SHOULD be processed in
   the bridge according to [RFC4605].  Broadcasting messages to all
   radio side ports of the bridge SHOULD be prevented.

   Further information on prevention of multicasting or broadcasting
   messages to all radio side ports are given in the following sections.

Internet-Draft           IPoEth over IEEE 802.16               July 2007


6.1.1.  Multicast Transmission Considerations

   Usually, the bridge replicates the IP multicast packets like IP
   broadcast packets into all its available ports with the exception of
   the incoming port.  As a result, the IP multicast packets would be
   transmitted even to SSs which do not participate in the corresponding
   multicast group.  To allow bridges to handle IP multicast more
   efficiently the IP multicast membership should be propagated between
   bridges.

   IGMP/MLD proxying in [RFC4605] is a simple mechanism for multicast
   packets forwarding based on the Internet Group Management Protocol
   (IGMP) or Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) membership information,
   which works only in a basic tree topology.  An IGMP/MLD proxy device
   does learning and proxying group membership information and forwards
   the IP multicast packets based on the membership information.
   Typically, the proxy device is located at an aggregation point, which
   has a single upstream interface and multiple downstream interfaces.

   The IEEE 802.16 Ethernet link model in Section 5.1 has a simple tree
   topology and [RFC4541] provides an application guide how bridge,
   non-IP device, to examine and learn group membership.  Hence,
   [RFC4605] can be applied to the IEEE 802.16 Ethernet link model to
   reduce the multicast packet flooding.

   The bridge in the IEEE 802.16 Ethernet link model SHOULD play a role
   in proxying IGMP/MLD messages as specified in [RFC4605].  The bridge
   SHOULD perform the host portion of IGMP/MLD process on its network
   side port and the router portion of IGMP/MLD process on its all radio
   side ports.  Note that the bridge SHOULD perform IGMP/MLD Querier on
   only radio side ports, which are already subscribed with received
   IGMP/MLD membership report messages.  This is due to the reduction of
   flooding of IGMP/MLD Query messages.  The bridge SHOULD maintain
   subscription information on each radio side port with received IGMP/
   MLD membership report messages and forward multicast packets from a
   network side port to radio side ports based on the subscription
   information.  In case of multicast packets from radio side ports, the
   bridge SHOULD forward the packets to a network side port as well as
   radio side ports, except the incoming radio side port, based on the
   subscription information.

6.1.2.  Broadcast Transmission Considerations

   The bridge typically floods the IP broadcast packets out of all
   connected ports except the port on which the packet was received.
   This behaviour in not appropriate with scarce resources and dormant-
   mode hosts in a wireless network such as an IEEE 802.16 based access
   network.



Jeon, et al.            Expires January 10, 2008               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft           IPoEth over IEEE 802.16               July 2007


   The bridge in the IEEE 802.16 Ethernet link model SHOULD discard all
   IP broadcast packets except ARP, DHCP (DHCPv4 and DHCPv6), IGMP, and
   MLD related traffic.  The ARP, DHCP, IGMP and MLD related packets
   SHOULD be forwarded with special rules specified in this
   specification.  Note that packets destined for permanently assigned
   multicast addresses such as 224.0.0.0/24 in IPv4 or FF02::1 in IPv6
   are also regarded as broadcast data.

6.2.  Proxy ARP

   Proxy ARP provides a process where a device on the link between hosts
   answers ARP Requests instead of the remote host.  In this
   specification, the Proxy ARP mechanism is used to force all traffic
   from hosts to the access router and to avoid broadcasting ARP
   Requests over the air depending on the particular deployment
   scenario.  The Proxy ARP process is usually co-located with the
   bridge behind the BS.

6.2.1.  Public Access Scenario Case

   The bridge behind the BSs SHOULD filter broadcast ARP Requests and
   SHOULD respond to all the ARP Requests from radio side port with the
   access router's Ethernet MAC address so that all IPv4 packets from
   SSs are forwarded to the access router.

6.2.2.  Enterprise LAN Scenario Case

   The bridge behind the BSs SHOULD maintain an ARP Cache large enough
   to accommodate ARP entries for all its serving SSs.  The ARP Cache
   SHOULD be updated by any packets including ARP Requests from SSs in
   the same way the bridge is updating its Filtering Database.

   Upon receiving the ARP Requests from SSs, the bridge SHOULD unicast
   ARP Replies back to SSs with Ethernet address of target host provided
   that the target address matches an entry in the ARP Cache.
   Otherwise, the bridge MAY flood the ARP Requests.  The bridge SHOULD
   silently discard any received self-ARP Requests.


7.  Access Router Considerations

   In the public access scenario, all packets between SSs will always be
   relayed via access router.  In this scenario, the access router
   SHOULD forward packets via same interface on which the access router
   received the packets, if source and destination addresses are
   reachable on the same interface.  This would result in a Redirect
   message from the access router [RFC0792][I-D.ietf-ipv6-rfc2461bis].
   The Redirect message SHOULD be suppressed.

Internet-Draft           IPoEth over IEEE 802.16               July 2007


8.  Prefix Assignment

8.1.  Public Access Scenario Case

   Unique IPv6 prefix per SS SHOULD be assigned because it results in
   layer 3 separation between SSs and it forces all packets from SSs to
   be transferred to an AR.  The AR SHOULD assign the IPv6 prefixes with
   Prefix Information option as specified in [RFC2461].

   One IPv4 prefix SHOULD be assigned to all SSs in a way that it
   benefits from high address assignment efficiency when concerning
   scarce IPv4 address space.  The prefix can be manually configured or
   automatically with subnet mask option in DHCPv4 [RFC2132].

8.2.  Enterprise LAN Scenario Case

   The AR SHOULD assign all SSs one IPv4 prefix in IPv4 over Ethernet
   and one or more IPv6 prefixes in IPv6 over Ethernet so that all SSs
   under the same AR share the subnet prefix.  Sharing the prefix means
   locating all SSs on the same subnetwork.


9.  Transmission of IP over Ethernet

9.1.  IPv4 over Ethernet

   [RFC0894] defines the transmission of IPv4 packets over Ethernet
   networks.  It contains the specification of the encapsulation of the
   IPv4 packets into Ethernet frames as well as rules for mapping of IP
   addresses onto Ethernet MAC addresses.  IP over Ethernet over
   IEEE802.16 MUST follow the operations specified in [RFC0894].

9.1.1.  Address Configuration

   IPv4 addresses can be configured manually or assigned dynamically
   from DHCPv4 server [RFC2131].

   DHCP clients may send DHCP DISCOVER and DHCP REQUEST messages with
   the BROADCAST bit set to request the DHCP server to broadcast its
   DHCP OFFER and DHCP ACK messages.  The bridge SHOULD filter these
   broadcast DHCP OFFER and DHCP ACK messages and forwards the broadcast
   messages only to the host defined by the client hardware address in
   the chaddr information element.

   Alternatively, the DHCP Relay Agent Information Option (option-82)
   [RFC3046] MAY be used to avoid DHCP broadcast replies.  The option-82
   consists of two type of sub-options; Circuit ID and Remote ID.  DHCP
   Relay Agent is usually located on bridges as Layer 2 DHCP Relay



Jeon, et al.            Expires January 10, 2008               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft           IPoEth over IEEE 802.16               July 2007


   Agent, like described in [TR101].  Bridge port number is possible as
   Circuit ID and Remote ID may be left unspecified.  Note that using
   option-82 requires option-82 aware DHCP servers.

9.1.2.  Address Resolution

   SSs MUST use Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) [RFC0826] for finding
   a destination's Ethernet MAC address.

9.2.  IPv6 over Ethernet

   [RFC2464] defines transmission of IPv6 Packets over Ethernet
   Networks.  In this document, encapsulation of IPv6 packets into
   Ethernet frames and mapping rules for IPv6 address to Ethernet
   address (i.e.  MAC address) MUST follow [RFC2464].

9.2.1.  Router Discovery, Prefix Discovery and Parameter Discovery

   Router Discovery, Prefix Discovery and Parameter Discovery procedures
   are achieved by receiving Router Advertisement messages.  In this
   specification, SSs perform above the discovery process by solicited
   Router Advertisement messages because periodic Router Advertisement
   messages are discarded on the bridges following the Broadcast Data
   Forwarding Rules in Section 6.1.2.

9.2.2.  Address Configuration

9.2.2.1.  Stateful Address Autoconfiguration

   When the'M' flag in the received RA is set, a SS SHOULD perform
   stateful address configuration according to [RFC3315].  In this case,
   an AR supports DHCPv6 server or relay function.

9.2.2.2.  Stateless Address Autoconfiguration

   SS SHOULD derive its global IPv6 addresses based on prefix and EUI-
   64-derived interface identifier and then confirmed through Duplicate
   Address Detection (DAD) as specified in [I-D.ietf-ipv6-rfc2462bis]
   and [I-D.ietf-ipv6-rfc2461bis].

9.2.3.  Address Resolution

   SS SHOULD send Neighbor Solicitation destined for solicited-node
   address corresponding to the target address in order to determine MAC
   address of a neighbor and then resolve the MAC address by receiving
   Neighbor Advertisement as specified in [I-D.ietf-ipv6-rfc2461bis].

Internet-Draft           IPoEth over IEEE 802.16               July 2007


9.3.  Maximum Transmission Unit Consideration

   [RFC2460] requires that the link layer support a minimum Maximum
   Transmission Unit (MTU) size of 1280 bytes and recommends a MTU size
   of at least 1500 bytes for IPv6 over Ethernet transmission.
   [RFC0894] also specifies 1500 bytes as a maximum length of IPv4 over
   Ethernet.  Therefore, IEEE 802.16 frame should carry a payload size
   of 1518 bytes including the Ethernet header size of 18 bytes or 1522
   bytes including additional VLAN tag size of 4 bytes if present.

   The Length field in IEEE 802.16 MAC header has a size of 11 bits and
   indicates length in bytes of the MAC PDU including CRC and MAC
   header.  Hence MAC PDU size is up to 2048 bytes and the maximum size
   of payload is 2038 bytes by subtracting size of CRC and IEEE 802.16
   MAC header from 2048 bytes.  Since the size of MAC PDU is sufficient
   to encapsulate an Ethernet packet carrying IP data size of 1500
   bytes, the size of the largest IPv4 and IPv6 packets over Ethernet
   over IEEE 802.16 SHOULD be 1500 bytes as specified in [RFC0894] and
   [RFC2460] respectively.


10.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce new vulnerability to operations of
   IPv4 over Ethernet and IPv6 over Ethernet.  [RFC3971] can be adopted
   for securing neighbor discovery processes.

Appendix A.  Multicast CID Deployment Considerations

   IEEE 802.16 allows for downlink CIDs associated to multiple SSs to
   support efficient transport of multicast and broadcast data.  While
   this looks in theory promising for solving the issue of the scarce
   radio resource it introduces a number of issues in real deployments:

   o  Incompatibility with advanced radio layer algorithms based on
      feedback information from the receiver: Many of the most advanced
      algorithms for enhancing the capacity of radio links like HARQ,
      Interference cancellation or MIMO are based on feedback from the
      receiver side and do not work with multiple receivers on the same
      CID.

   o  Incompatibility with advanced antenna systems: Advanced antenna
      systems deploy multiphase antenna arrays to direct the
      transmission to the particular receiver.  Advanced antenna systems
      work well with unicast links but the state of the art is not able
      to support efficiently multicast links.

Internet-Draft           IPoEth over IEEE 802.16               July 2007


   o  Increased interference level due to higher transmission power for
      multicast links: Multicast links can not deploy advanced radio
      layer algorithms like HARQ and therefore have to use higher
      transmission power level to generate the signal to noise ratio
      required for error-free detection.  Higher transmission power also
      increases the interference level in the cell as well as in
      neighbor cells, which reduces the overall capacity of a cell.

   o  Reduced efficiency with mobile terminals: A multicast CID must be
      configured to provide sufficient signal to noise ratio to the most
      distant terminal.  If terminals are moving, the radio transmission
      characteristics may change and may require frequent re-adjustments
      of the radio link parameters.  As more moving terminals are
      associated with a multicast CID as more likely the link conditions
      require high reserves to keep all terminals permanently connected.

   o  Loss of power-down capabilities: Terminals associated to a
      multicast CID have to wake up and decode the frames whenever
      frames as send.  This makes it difficult to keep terminals for
      longer periods in low power consumption states.

   o  Increased complexity of the system: Each multicast CID requires
      its own encryption key.  This requires that SSs have to have the
      capability to establish and maintain multiple encryption keys.
      The BS requires for each of the multicast CIDs an instance of the
      group key management system.

   Taking the many drawbacks of multicast CIDs into account, the high
   complexity and low transmission efficiency restricts the usability
   for only exceptional cases when power consumption of SSs is no issue,
   when SSs are hardly moving and when multicast CIDs are serving a high
   number of SSs concurrently.  All these conditions are hardly
   fulfilled in today's mobile networking environment with small cell
   sizes, fast moving terminals and a huge variety of information
   sources which makes it unlikely that two users in a cell are
   requesting concurrently the same information.
