<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">This document specifies an extension to the RADIUS protocol that enables service providers to perform accounting and charging in an "online" fashion. In particular, they enable the service provider to </p>

<ul class="empty">
<li>(a) ensure that subscriber's remaining funds suffice before the service is delivered, and </li>
<li>(b) interrupt service provision when the funds are exhausted.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">These capabilities are typically used in scenarios where the subscriber maintains a prepaid account with the service provider; hence, this extension is called the "prepaid" extension for RADIUS. The functionality described in this document is often referred as "online charging" in comparison to "offline charging" support provided by RFC 2866 <a href="#RFC2866">[RFC2866]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">Note that this document does not follow the RADIUS design guidelines outlined in RFC 6158 <a href="#RFC6158">[RFC6158]</a> since this document predates RFC 6158 and documents existing implementations.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">The extensions were designed with the following goals in mind: </p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Make use of existing infrastructure as much as possible (including enabling the interworking of RADIUS-based and Diameter-based infrastructures), and thereby limit the amount of necessary capital expenditures, </li>
<li>provide the ability to rate service requests in an "online" fashion,</li>
<li>provide the ability to charge the user's account prior to service provision,</li>
<li>protect against revenue loss, i.e., to prevent an end user from obtaining service when the available funds do not suffice, </li>
<li>protect against fraud, and </li>
<li>be deployable for a number of services independent of the access network technology. </li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.7">The architecture between the entities that execute the RADIUS protocols, with the extensions defined in this document, assumes that the rating of chargeable events does not occur in the element that provides the service. Instead, the rating may be performed at a dedicated server, termed the "prepaid-enabled AAA server" or simply "prepaid server" (PPS). Alternatively, the actual rating may occur in an entity related to this prepaid server.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.8">Furthermore, this document assumes that a "quota server" is available which, through co-ordination with the rating entity and an account balance manager, is able to provide a quota indication for a particular user when requested. This quota server may or may not coexist in the prepaid server. </p>

The billing domain typically comprises post-processing systems, such as the operator's billing system or billing mediation device.

<dt>Online Charging:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">
<br><br> Online charging is a process where charging information for resource usage is collected concurrently with that resource usage in the same fashion as in offline charging. However, authorization for the network resource usage must be obtained prior to the actual resource usage to occur. This authorization is granted by the PPS upon request from the PPC. When receiving a resource usage request, the PPS assembles the relevant charging information and generates a charging event in real-time. The PPS then returns an appropriate resource usage authorization. The resource usage authorization may be limited in its scope (e.g., volume of data or duration), therefore the authorization may have to be renewed from time to time as long as the resource usage persists. Note that the charging information utilized in online charging is not necessarily identical to the charging information employed in offline charging. In conclusion, online charging is a mechanism where charging information can affect, in real-time, the service rendered and therefore a direct interaction of the charging mechanism with the control of resource usage is required.

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.2.p.1">Why not use existing RADIUS attributes to construct a protocol for prepaid scenarios? This could lead to a solution where no code has to be modified at existing devices.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.2.p.2">It is indeed possible to construct a solution for prepaid scenarios using existing RADIUS attributes. The RADIUS server would send an Access-Accept message containing a Session-Timeout(27) and include a Termination-Action(29) in the RADIUS-request. Upon receiving the Access-Accept message, the NAS would meter the duration of the session and upon termination of the session the NAS would generate an Access-Request message again. The RADIUS server would then re-authenticate the session and reply with an Access-Accept message indicating the amount of additional time in a Session-Timeout(27). Alternatively, it could respond with an Access-Reject message if there were no more resources in the user account. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.2.p.3">Moreover, if the user terminates the session prematurely, the NAS could indicate this in the accounting stream so that unused funds can be returned into the prepaid user account.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.2.p.4">Unfortunately, the above "solution" has a number of drawbacks, including the following.</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>It only supports time-based charging. The solution presented in this document supports multiple charging metrics.</li>
<li>Using accounting messages to recoup unused time may be problematic because RADIUS accounting messages are not delivered in real-time. A RADIUS server may store-and-forward accounting messages in batches.  Thus, relying on accounting messages for the purposes of prepaid may cause revenue leakage. The solution presented in this document does not rely on Accounting packets at all. It uses Access-Request messages, which are required to flow through any network in real-time.</li>
<li>Session-Timeout(27) is not a mandatory attribute. If a prepaid subscriber is served by a NAS that does not adhere to Session-Timeout then that subscriber may use the service for an undetermined period of time. </li>
<li>Termination-Action(29) presents its own issues. Firstly, the behaviour of Termination-Action(29) is not mandatory. Secondly, according to RFC 2865 <a href="#RFC2865">[RFC2865]</a>, Termination-Action fires when the provision of the service has completed. However, service should not be terminated when negotiating additional quota, because this should happen in a manner transparent to the subscriber. Due to the fact that Termination-Action occurs when the service is completed, it is unclear whether or not user experience would be affected if this attribute would be used in a prepaid scenario. The RADIUS server might even allocate a new IP address to the subscriber device after a Termination-Action. Also, the RADIUS server has no way of telling why a given Access-Request message was generated. The RADIUS server might have to wait for the corresponding accounting packet to determine the reason. Finally, re-authenticating the subscriber may take too long. The solution presented in this document allows quota replenishing to occur without affecting user experience. No re-authentication is required and quotas can be negotiated before the available credit actually runs out.</li>
<li>Due to the fact that the standard RADIUS attributes are not mandatory, the correct prepaid operation is really an act of faith on the part of the RADIUS server. If Session-Timeout(27) and/or Termination-Action(29) are not supported, the prepaid subscriber might be able to obtain the service for free. The solution described in this document requires that a PPC informs the RADIUS server, regardless of whether or not the latter supports the prepaid extensions. The RADIUS server can then determine whether or not service should be granted. For example, if a prepaid subscriber is connected to a NAS that does not support prepaid, the RADIUS server can either instruct the NAS to tunnel the traffic to another entity in the home network (e.g., an Home Agent) that supports prepaid, or cause it to provide only a restricted service. </li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.2.p.6">The solution presented in this document requires the support of two mandatory and one optional attribute. Furthermore, it does not require a great amount of additional code at a NAS (or similar device) that already supports time or volume-based metering. The solution requires that RADIUS entities advertise their prepaid capabilities in an Access-Request and that they generate an Access-Request packet with Service-Type="Authorize-Only" in order to obtain more quota when or before the current quota is used up. It also requires the NAS to send an Access-Request with Service-Type="Authorize-Only" when the session terminates in order to refund the subscriber account. </p>

<ul>
<li>The values carried in the Service Identifiers are pre-configured between the PPC and the PPS.</li>
<li>The decision about the service rating happens at the PPS. </li>
<li>The decision whether credit control requests for two services are placed in a resource pool are made by the PPS. </li>
<li>The decision which services belong to the same rating group are pre-configured at the PPC. Once a rating group is authorized it is not necessary to re-authorize an additional service that belongs to the same rating group at the PPS again. </li>

<h1 id="rfc.section.1.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.1.4">1.4.</a> <a href="#case" id="case">Example Use Case</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.4.p.1">This section describes the sequence of events in an example RADIUS prepaid transaction.</p>
<p></p>

<ol>
<li>When an end host attaches to a network (for example, using IEEE 802.1X), as usual, the PPC that is servicing the subscriber uses the AAA infrastructure in order to authenticate and authorize the subscriber with respect to the requested service. In order to do this, it sends a RADIUS Access-Request to the AAA server. This Access-Request contains the subscriber's credentials and may contain the prepaid capabilities of the PPC. </li>
<li>The authentication procedure proceeds. This may involve several message exchanges, as it is the case with the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) <a href="#RFC2284">[RFC2284]</a>. Once the subscriber has been successfully authenticated, the home AAA server determines that the subscriber is a prepaid subscriber and requests authorisation from the PPS. This request MUST include the prepaid capabilities of the serving PPC. </li>
<li>The PPS, possibly with the help of the backend infrastructure, validates that the subscriber has a prepaid account and that the account is active. It further validates that the PPC has the appropriate prepaid capabilities. If all is in order, the PPS authorises the subscriber to use the network. Otherwise it rejects the request. The decision is sent to the AAA system in the form of a response message. In the case of success, this message contains attributes that indicate the allocation of a portion of the subscriber credit. This portion is called the "initial quota" and is expressed in units of time or volume. The response may also include a threshold value. Note that only a portion of the user's funds is allocated because the user may be engaged in other services that may draw on the same account. For example, the user may be engaged in a data session and a voice session. Although these two services would draw from the same account, they form separate parts of the overall system. If the entire quota was allocated to the data session then the user would have no more funds for a voice session. </li>
<li>The AAA system incorporates the attributes received from the PPS into an Access-Accept message that it sends to the PPC. Note that the AAA system is responsible for authorizing the service whereas the prepaid system is responsible for prepaid authorization. </li>
<li>Upon receiving the Access-Response, the PPC starts the prepaid data session and meters the session based on time or volume, as indicated in the message.</li>
<li>Once the consumption approaches the allocated limit (as expressed by the threshold), the PPC will request additional quota. Re-authorization for additional quota flows through the AAA system to the PPS. The PPS revalidates the subscriber account and subtracts the previously allocated quota from the current balance. If there is remaining balance, it reauthorizes the request with an additional quota allotment.  Otherwise, the PPS rejects the request. Note that the replenishment of the quota is a re-authorization procedure and does not require the subscriber to authenticate himself again. </li>
<li>Upon receiving a re-allotment of the quota, the PPC continues to provide the requested service until the new threshold is reached. If the request for additional quota cannot be fulfilled then the PPC lets the subscriber use the remaining quota and terminates the session.  Alternatively, instead of terminating the session, the PPC may restrict service access in such a way that the subscriber can only reach a particular web server. This web server maybe used to allow the subscriber to replenish his account. This restriction can also be used to allow new subscribers to set up prepaid accounts in the first place. </li>
<li>Should the subscriber terminate the session before the quota is exhausted, the remaining balance allotted to the session is refunded into his account. </li>
</ol>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.4.p.3">Note that the subscriber may have disconnected while the PPC is waiting for the initial quota. The entire allocated quota will have to be credited back to the subscribers account in this case. Also note that the PPS maintains session state for the subscriber. This state includes how much account balance was allocated during the last quota enquiry and how much is left in the account. Therefore, it is required that all messages about the session reach the same (and correct) PPS.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.3">As shown in <a href="#mservicesdiagram">Figure 2</a>, a session may be associated with multiple services. Each service is identified by a service identifier (Service-ID). The format of the Service-ID is not in the scope of this document.  It may, for example, be expressed as a 5-tuple {i.e., source IP address, destination IP address, source port, destination port, and protocol type}.

<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.1">When working with multiple services a new problem arises because one service may consume its quota faster than another service. When the user balance is close to exhaustion, a situation could arise where one service is unable to obtain quota while another service has plenty of quota remaining. Unless the quotas can be rebalanced, the SAD would then have to terminate the former service. Moreover, it is likely that each service generates a certain amount of RADIUS prepaid traffic. In an environment with many users and charged services, this amount of traffic may become a considerable overhead that could lead to inefficiency. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.2">One method to circumvent the above situation is to use a so-called "resource pool". Resource pools enable the allocation of resources to multiple services of a session by allocating resources to a pool and have services draw their quota from the pool at a rate appropriate to that service. When the quota that has been allocated to the pool is close to exhaustion, the entire pool (rather than individual services) is replenished.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.2">The rating of a service can be quite complex. While some operators follow linear pricing models, others may wish to apply more complex functions.

The PPS authorises the Rating Group by allocating a quota to it and assign it to a Resource Pool. When an additional service that belongs to an already authorised Rating Group is instantiated, the PPC does not need to re-authorize this service. This effectively means that the PPC meters the service such that it draws from the already allocated quota.  Therefore, no RADIUS messages need to be exchanged in this case.

<p id="rfc.section.2.4.p.9">For time based services, the quota is continuously consumed at the regular rate of 60 seconds per minute.

Similarly, the server can determine the units consumed at the before rate and the units consumed at the rate afterward in the event that the end user closes the session before the consumption of the allotted quota. There is no need for additional traffic between the PPC and the PPS in the case of tariff time changes for continuous time based service. Therefore, the tariff change mechanism is not used for such services.

<p id="rfc.section.3.7.p.1">In roaming scenarios with Mobile-IP, the prepaid data session should be maintained transparently if the HA is acting as the access device hosting the PPC. As the subscriber device associates with a new access service device (AP or PDSN that supports PPC capability), this service access device sends a RADIUS Access-Request and the subscriber is re-authenticated and reauthorized. The service access device SHALL include the PPAC attribute in the RADIUS Access-Request. In this manner, the procedure follows the Authentication and Authorization procedure described earlier.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.7.p.2">If the HA was acting as the service access device before handoff, then the prepaid session does not undergo any change after the handoff because the Mobile IP session is anchored at the HA and the user's Home IP address does not change. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.7.p.3">In the case of a wireless access point or PDSN acting as the service access device, it is likely that the user's (care-of) IP address will change. The prepaid session will be affected by this. In this scenario the service access device shall send an Access-Request message which is routed to the home network and SHALL reach the PPS that is serving this session. The PPS correlates the new authorization request with the existing active session and assigns a quota to the new request. Any outstanding quota at the old service access device SHALL be returned to the PPS if the Mobile-IP nodes (HA and FA) support registration revocation (Mobile IPv4 only). Specifically, the quota SHOULD be returned when the service access device sends the Authorize-Only Access-Request with PPAQ Update-Reason set to either "Remote Forced Disconnect" or "Client Service Termination". In order to trigger the sending of this last Authorize-Only Access- Request, the PPS may issue a Disconnect Message [3576] to the service access device.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.7.p.4">Even if the subscriber moves to a service access device that does not have prepaid capabilities can the prepaid data service continue. This can be done by requesting the Home Agent (assuming it has such capabilities) to take over the responsibilities of the service access device (i.e. metering). This scenario will be discussed in detail in a later version of this document. </p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.8.p.2">A PPC that supports prepaid operations for multi-services SHOULD set the "Multi-Services Supported" bit in the PPAC. When working with multi-services, we need to differentiate between the services. A Service-Id attribute is used in the PPAQ in order to uniquely differentiate between the services. The exact definition of the Service-Id attribute is outside the scope of this document. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.8.p.3">A PPAQ that contains a Service-Id is associated with that service. A PPAQ that contains a Rating-Group-Id is associated with that Rating-Group.

Similarly, if the PPC supports rating groups then it may request a quota for the rating group by sending a PPAQ containing the Rating-Group-Id. In both cases the Update-Reason is set to "Initial-Request". The Authorize-Only Access-Request message MAY contain more than one PPAQ. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.8.1.p.2">Upon receiving an Authorize-Only Access-Accept message containing one or more PPAQs, the PPS allocates resources to each PPAQ.

In order to replenish the quota, the PPC sends an Authorize-Only Access-Request message containing one or more PPAQs. Each PPAQ MUST contain the appropriate QID, Service-ID or Rating-Group-Id (or neither the Service-ID or Rating-Group-Id if the quota replenishment is for the "Access Service"). The Update-Reason filed indicates either "Threshold reached"(3), or "Quota reached"(4).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.8.2.p.2">Upon receiving an Authorize-Only Access-Request packet with one or more PPAQs the PPS responds with a new PPAQ for that service.

This functionality corresponds to refunding. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.8.6.p.2">The QID subtype MUST be set to a unique value and is used by the PPS to detect duplicates. The Update Reason field MUST be set to One-Time Charging.  Upon receiving a One-Time charge PPAQ, the RADIUS server authenticates the user and, if successful, passes the PPAQ to the PPS. The PPS locates the account and debits or credits it accordingly.

<p id="rfc.section.3.8.6.p.3">In case of a successful operation the HAAA forwards the message to the PPC with an Access Accept message. Since this is a one-time charge the PPC MUST NOT allow the session to continue. Therefore, the RADIUS server SHOULD include in the Access-Accept a Session-Timeout set to 0.

     The C-bit of the continuation field indicates 
     if a attribute is being fragmented. When the 
     C-bit is set to one &#8216;1&#8217; this indicates that 
     the attribute is being fragmented that is
     the next VSA of the same type is to be appended 
     to this attribute. When the C-bit is set to zero 
     '0' this indicates that the next attribute is 
     not a fragment of this attribute.
     An attribute that is not being fragmented will 
     have the C-bit set to '0'. An attribute that is 
     being fragmented will have its C-bit set to '1' 
     for all fragments until the last fragment, which 
     will have its C-bit set to '0' indicating it's 
     the last fragment of the attribute. The r-bits 
     are reserved for future use. They SHALL be set 
     to zero by the sender and SHALL be ignored by 
     the receiver.

     The value of the C-bit MAY be 0 or 1.

<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.1.p.2">The user logs on (1). The PPC sends a RADIUS Access Request message to the PPS (2), and includes the prepaid-specific PPAC AVP. This AVP indicates that both duration-based and volume-based metering is supported. However, it also indicated that multiple services, rating groups and resource pools are not supported. Note that, since this is not an "Authorize-Only" message, no PPAQ attribute with Update Reason="initial request" is included (see Section 3.7.1).  The PPS then authenticates the user and authorizes the access service, as is usual in RADIUS. Note that the PPAC AVP is appended by the PPC in at least the last message that is sent to the home AAA server during this possibly multiple-round exchange. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.1.p.3">If authentication and authorization is successful (in this example this is assumed), then the PPS identifies the user's prepaid account from the included base RADIUS AVPs, and determines the capabilities of the PPC from the PPAC attribute. Assuming that sufficient funds are available in the user's prepaid account, the PPS reserves some of these and rates the service. In this example, the PPS reserves, say, 2 Euros and determines that the access service is rated at 0.4 Euro per MB. This results in 5 MB of quota being granted. The PPS also determines that the PPC should ask for this quota to be replenished once 4.5 MB have been consumed. Thus, it creates an Access Accept message with a Volume-Threshold indication of 4.5MB. It further associates the QID=5 to this reservation. This identifier can be used to later uniquely identify the prepaid session, user, account, etc. The resulting Access Accept message is sent to the PPC (3). </p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.1.p.4">Upon reception of message (4), the PPC provides the access service to the user and meters it accordingly. At some point in time, the threshold is reached, i.e., 4.5MB of "access service" have been consumed by the user. At that point, the PPC generates an Authorize-Only Access Request that contains the usual RADIUS attributes and a PPAQ attributes that reports the amount of consumed quota, and the request for replenishment, i.e., the Update-Reason= THRESHOLD REACHED (5). Note that the QID in this message is the same as the one previously received from the PPS.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.1.p.5">Upon reception of message (5), the PPS identifies the user and his account from the QID. In also determines that a prepaid session is ongoing, and that enough credit remains in the prepaid account in order for the access service to continue being provided. Since 4.5 MB have been consumed, the PPS subtracts 1.8 Euros from the user's prepaid account. The PPS decides to reserve another 2.8 euros from the user's account. (This results in 3 euros being reserved in total at this point in time.) As the access service is rated at 0.4 euros per MB, the PPS determines that another 7 MB of quota should be granted. This results in a total cumulative quota allocation of 12 MB for the access service. The PPS further calculates the new threshold value of 11.5 MB. Since this is a new quota reservation, the PPS also allocates a new QID to it, in this example QID=8. The resulting RADIUS message is sent to the PPC (6).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.1.p.6">Upon reception of message (6), the PPC updates its records and continues provisioning access to the user. At some point the user logs off (7). The PPC must then report how many resources were consumed, so that the PPC can subtract the appropriate monetary amount from the user's prepaid account. To this end the PPC constructs an Authorize-Only Access Request message with a PPAQ attributes for the access service. In this example, 7 MB were consumed by the access service in total. The PPC reports 7 MB its final message (8). The PPS correlates the report, using the QID, to the previous session state. It determines, from the previous records, that the access service had consumed another 4.5 MB before (as indicated in message (6)). This means that, of the 7 MB, only 3.5 MB have not yet been subtracted from the user's account. Thus, the PPS subtracts another 1.4 euros from the user's account and, since the session is to be terminated (REASON=ACCESS SERVICE TERMINATED), releases any reserved monetary amount.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.1.p.7">The PPS responds with an Access Response as required by the RADIUS base specification (9). </p>

<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.2.p.2">The user logs on (1). The PPC sends a RADIUS Access Request message to the home AAA server (2), and includes the prepaid-specific PPAC AVP. This AVP indicates that both duration-based and volume-based metering is supported, as well as tariff switching. The home AAA server then may authenticate and user and authorize the access service, as is usual in RADIUS. Note that the PPAC AVP is appended by the PPC in at least the last message that is sent to the PPS during this possibly multiple-round exchange.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.2.p.3">If authentication and authorization is successful (in this example this is assumed), the PPS identifies the user's prepaid account from the included base RADIUS AVPs, and determines the capabilities of the PPC from the PPAC attribute.  In this example, it is assumed that a tariff switch is about to occur in 300 seconds from the current time. Suppose that the access service is currently rated at 0.5 euros per MB and in the next tariff period it is rated at 0.6 euros per MB. Suppose further that a third tariff period is about to start in 6000 seconds from current time and that that access service is rated at 0.8 euros per MB in that period. The PPS then decides to reserve 12 euros from the user's account. Since it is conceivable that the user may consume all allocated quota in the (more expensive) "0.6-euro" period, the PPS reserves 20 MB of quota, and determines a threshold value of 18 MB. It constructs a Radius Access Accept message with a PPAQ attribute that reflects these choices, and carries a Quota Identifier QID=5. It further adds a PTS AVP in the message which is linked to the PPAQ via the common QID value. The PTS AVP contains a TSI attribute indicating that a tariff switch will occur in 300 seconds. It also includes a TITSU attribute with the value of 6000 seconds. This is included in order to make sure that the PPC will report the consumed quota before the "2-euro" tariff period will start. The message is sent to the PPC (3).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.2.p.4">Upon reception of message (3), the PPC provides the access service to the user and meters it accordingly (4). It also keeps track of time. That is, it remembers how many octets are consumed before and how many after the tariff switch that will take place in 300 seconds.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.2.p.5">In this example it is assumed that the user consumes the allocated quota rather slowly. In particular, nearly 6000 seconds (the value indicated by TITSU SubType) pass without the threshold of 18 MB being reached. The PPC notices this and must therefore report usage and request the quota to be replenished despite the fact that the threshold has not been reached. In this example, it decides to do so 100 seconds before the 6000 seconds are reached. To this end, it constructs an Authorization Access Request message including a PPAQ that indicates that 14 MB have been consumed up to now. It also includes a PTS attribute in order to indicate, using the VUATS SubType, that 11 MB of these were consumed after the tariff switch. The message is sent to the the PPS (5).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.2.p.6">The PPS can link the message to previous session state via the QID. It now rates the consumed volume as follows. The 11 MB that were consumed after the tariff switch correspond to 11 * 0.6 = 6.6 euros and the remaining 14-11=3 MB to 3 * 0.5 = 1.5 euros. Thus, the PPS subtracts the amount of 6.6+1.5=8.1 euros from the user's account, which leads to a remainder of 12 - 8.1 = 3.9 euros being reserved.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.2.p.7">The PPS now determines that message (5) was sent in order to replenish the quota for this prepaid session. This can be deduced from the UPDATE REASON field, which indicates that the PPC sent this message because the time indicated by the TITSU SubType is approacing. The PPS now determines that enough credit remains in the user's prepaid account in order for the access service to continue being provided and decides to reserve another 8.9 euros from the user's account. Since it is conceivable that the user will consume the 6 unused MB of quota from the previous allocation, as well as the entire quota that is to be allocated now, entirely in the "0.8-euro" period, the quota that should now be granted in addition to the previous 20 MB should be 10 MB. This is because 0.9 of the 8.9 euros are being reserved in order to "cover the worst case scenario". The fact that 0.9 euros are reserved for this purpose is due to the fact that the unused 6 MB from the previous allocation correspond to 4.8 euros (with 0.8 euros per MB). This is 4.8 - 3.9 = 0.9 euros more than the amount of funds that are still "reserved" from the previous allocation. (After this reservation, the total amount of reserved money is 8.9 + 3.9 = 12.8 euros, which corresponds to 16 (10+6) MB being consumed in the "0.8-euro" period.)</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.2.p.8">Since quotas are encoded in a cumulative way in RADIUS, the PPS includes a VolumeQuota of 30 MB into the Access Accept message (6). The PPS further calculates the new threshold value of 28 MB. Since this is a new quota reservation, the PPS also allocates a new QID to it, in this example QID=8. The resulting RADIUS message is sent to the PPC (6).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.2.p.9">Upon reception of message (6), the PPC updates its records and continues providing access to the user. At some point the user logs off (7). The PPC must then report how many resources were consumed, so that the PPC can subtract the appropriate monetary amount from the user's prepaid account. To this end the PPC constructs an Authorize- Only Access Request message with a PPAQ attributes for the access service. In this example, 17 MB were consumed by the access service in total. The PPC reports 17 MB its final message (8). The PPS correlates the report, using the QID, to the previous session state. It determines, from the previous records, that the access service had consumed 14 MB before (as indicated in message (5)). This means that, of the 17 MB, only the monetary equivalent for 3 MB have not yet been subtracted from the user's account. The PPS calculates how much should be deducted from the user's account as follows.  Since the VUATS SubType indicates that 2.5MB were consumed after the tariff switch, only 0.5 MB were consumed before that. Thus, the monetary equivalent is 0.5 * 0.6 + 2.5 * 0.8 = 3.6 euros. That is, the PPS subtracts 3.6 euros from the user's prepaid account. Since the session has by now be terminated by the PPC (REASON=ACCESS SERVICE TERMINATED), the PPS now releases any reserved monetary amount, in this example 12.8 - 3.6 = 9.2 euros.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.2.p.10">The PPS responds with an Access Response as required by the RADIUS base specification (9).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.2.p.11">Remark: In this example, two tariff switches take place. In other scenarios, of course, only one tariff switch may occur. In such scenarios the TITSU SubType is not used.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.3.p.2">The user logs on (1). The PPC sends a RADIUS Access Request message to the PPS (2), and includes the prepaid-specific PPAC AVP, indicating that multiple services, rating groups and resource pools are supported. Note that, since this is not an "Authorize- Only" message, no PPAQ attribute with Update Reason="initial request" is included (see Section 3.7.1). The PPS then may authenticate the user and authorize the access service, as is usual in RADIUS.  Note that the PPAC AVP is appended by the PPC in at least the last message that is sent to the PPS during this possibly multiple-round exchange.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.3.p.3">If authentication and authorization is successful (in this example this is assumed), the PPS identifies the user's prepaid account from the included base RADIUS AVPs, and determines the capabilities of the PPC from the PPAC attribute.  Assuming that sufficient funds are available in the user's prepaid account, the PPS reserves some of these and rates the service. In this example, the PPS reserves 5 Euros and determines that the access service is rated at 1 Euro per MB. In anticipation that the user requests more chargeable services throughout this prepaid session, and since this is supported by the PPC, the PPS further associates a resource pool with this reservation, in this example PoolID=1. The PPC also specifies the multiplier = 1 for the access service. Note that, since 5MB = 5242880 octets, 1 unit in the resource pool corresponds to 5 / 5242880 euros, which is about 0.000095367431640625 Eurocents. (However, the PPC does not need to know that.) Moreover, the PPS associates the QID=5 to this reservation.  This identifier can be used to later uniquely identify the prepaid session, user, account, etc. The resulting Access Accept message is sent to PPC (3).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.3.p.4">Upon reception of message (3), the PPC provides the access service to the user and meters it accordingly (4). That is, for every octet consumed, the PPC subtracts 1 unit (since the multiplier is 1) from the resouce pool with PoolID=1.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.3.p.5">At some point in time, the user requests another chargeable service, namely service A (5). The PPC generates an Authorize-Only Access Request that contains the usual RADIUS attributes and the Service-ID identifying service A (6). The PPC has determined that service A is rated in an identical way as at least one more service. Thus, service A has been configured to belong to a rating group, in this example the group with Rating-Group-ID=1. This identifier is included is message (6).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.3.p.6">Upon reception of message (6), the PPS identifies the user and his account from the base RADIUS attributes, the fact that a prepaid session is ongoing, and determines that enough credit remains in the prepaid account in order for service A to be provided. The PPS also determines that service A is rated at 0.10 euros per minute. The PPS decides to reserve another 5 euros from the users account; this corresponds to 50 minutes or, as encoded in the DurationQuota SubType, 3000 seconds. As service A draws from the same prepaid account as the access service, the PPS associates this reservation with the same resource pool as the previous reservation (QID=5), namely the pool with PoolID=1. Note that, in order for the abstract units in the pool to be consistent, the multiplier has to be 1747.63. This is because each second corresponds to about 0.10 / 60 = 0.00167 euros, which is about 1747.63 times the value of an abstract resource pool unit, as this was determined by the first allocation of quota to the pool (i.e., 0.000095367431640625 Eurocents). Since this is a new quota reservation, the PPS also allocates a new QID to it, in this example QID=7. The resulting RADIUS message is sent to the PPC (7).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.3.p.7">Upon reception of message (7), the PPC adjusts the units in resource pool 1.  That is, it first determines how much quota had been allocated to service A in the past, and subtracts this from the quota reservation found in the message.  Since this is the first quota reservation for service A, there is nothing to subtract. Thus, it adds 3000 * 1747.63 = 5242890 units to the pool and remembers that 3000 seconds have been allocated to service A during this prepaid session.  The PPC then provides service A to the user, and meters it against resource pool 1. That is, for every second it subtracts 1747.63 units from the pool.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.3.p.8">At some point in time, the user requests service B (8). The PPC determines that service B is rated exactly in the same way as service A, i.e., that they belong to the same rating group, namely the one with Rating-Group-ID=1. Since this rating group has been effectively authorised by the allocation of quota with QID=7, the PPC provides service B to the user immediately. It is rated in the same way as service A, i.e., for every second provided, 1747.63 units are subtracted from credit pool 1.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.3.p.9">At some point in time, resource pool 1 is close to exhaustion. (For example, the PPC may determine that the pool is "close to exhaustion" when has less than 10% its initial amount of units.) At that point, the PPC needs to ask for replenishment for the pool. Suppose that, at that point in time, 4MB of "access service", 45 minutes of "service A", and 10 minutes of "service B" were provided to the user. Note that this corresponds to (4*1048576) + (55*60*1747.63) = 4194304 + 5767179 = 9961483 abstract service units from the pool. The PPC constructs an Authorize-Only Access Request message that reports the usage for the "access service" and "service A". This message contains two PPAQ attributeS, is sent to the PPS (9). Note that is the message it appears that "service A" has consumed more than it was allocated (i.e., 55 minutes although only 50 minutes were initially allocated to it). This is not a a problem since the PPS knows that "service A" was drawing from the same pool as the "access service" and that the "access service" did only consume 4 out of the 5 MB it was allocated.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.3.p.10">Upon reception of message (9), the PPS subtracts 4 euros from the user's account for the "access service" and another 5.5 euros for "service A". (This includes the charge incurred by "service B" up to that point in time, although the PPS is not aware of "service B" being provisioned to the user.) The PPS then determines that sufficient funds remain in the prepaid account in order for both services to be continued. The PPS decides to reserve another 3MB for the access service and 30 minutes for "service A". This corresponds to 3+3=6 euros. Since in RADIUS prepaid the quotas are encoded in a cumulative manner, the PPAQ attribute that grants the quota for the "access service" contains a Volume-Quota SubType of 8MB (8388608 octets), which is the 5MB that were initially allocated, plus the 3MB allocated now. The resource pool identifier is, as previously, PoolID=1 and the multiplier is 1. Similarly, the PPAQ that grants quota for "service A" contains 4800 seconds (the initial 3000 plus 1800 that correspond to the 30 additional minutes). Again, the PoolID=1 and multiplier=1747.63. The resulting Access Response message is sent to the PPC (10).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.3.p.11">When the PPC received message (10) it checks how much quota has been allocated previously to the "access service". It finds that the answer is 5MB (5242880 octets); thus, out of the 8MB (8388608 octets) that are indicated by the PPAQ with QID=8, only 3MB (3145728 octets) have not yet been added to resource pool 1. The PPC thus adds 3145728 abstract units to resource pool 1 (since the multiplier is 1). The PPC then acts similarly on the other PPAQ attribute that exists in message (11). That is, the PPC determines that 3000 seconds of quota for "service A" had already been added to the pool. Thus only 1800 out of the 4800 should be additionally added to the pool. Since the applicable multiplier here is 1747.63, the PPC adds further 3145734 abstract units to the pool 1.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.3.p.12">The PPC then continues to provide the access service, "service A" and "service B" to the user, and meters them against the pool, as previously.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.3.p.13">At some point the user logs off (11). The PPC must then report how many resources were consumed, so that the PPC can subtract the appropriate monetary amount from the user's prepaid account. To this end the PPC constructs an Authorize-Only Access Request message with two PPAQ attributes; one for the access service and one for "service A". Suppose that, in total, 6.5MB were consumed by the access service, 70 minutes were consumed by "service A" and 20 minutes by "service B". The PPC reports 6.5MB (6815744 octets) and 90 minutes (5400 seconds) in its final message (12). The PPS determines, from the previous records, that the access service consumed another 2.5MB (since 4MB out of the 6.5MB were already reported in message (9), and that "service A" consumed further 600 seconds. This corresponds to 2.5 + (600/60)*0.1 = 2.5+ 1=3.5 euros.  Thus, the PPS only subtracts 2.5 out of the 6 previously reserved euros from the user's prepaid account and responds with an Access Response as required by the RADIUS base specification (13).</p>

<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20B">Appendix B.</a> <a href="#translator" id="translator">Translation between RADIUS Prepaid and Diameter Credit Control</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix B.p.1">Note: This section is informative.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix B.p.2">In scenarios where the service metering device uses the "RADIUS prepaid" (RPP) protocol for accounting and prepaid charging while the AAA infrastructure uses the "Diameter Credit Control" (DCC) protocol, a translation agent that enables the interoperation of both systems, is desirable. This also applies vice versa, i.e., in scenarios where the AAA infrastructure uses RADIUS and the service metering device uses Diameter. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix B.p.3">The idea of such a translation agent would be to convert incoming RPP (resp. DCC) messages into outgoing DCC (resp. RPP) messages. It would be, in principle, desirable for the translation agent to be stateless. That is, the agent should not be required to internally maintain information about each ongoing RADIUS or Diameter session. However, under the current specification of RPP and DCC, this appears to be impossible due to a number of reasons. These include the following. </p>
<p></p>

<ol>
<li>The transport mechanism for DCC is TCP, which requires per-session state to be maintained at both endpoints of the communication. Note, however, that, in principle, each DCC message could be sent over a dedicated TCP connection which is torn down as soon as the message is sent. This, however, is likely to be unacceptable in terms of efficiency. </li>
<li>While RPP messages encode the cumulative amount of consumed/requested resources, DCC messages carry the difference from the previous message. This means that the translation agent has to maintain the current amount of consumed/requested resources in order to be able to calculate the correct amount to be put into an outgoing message. </li>
</ol>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix B.p.5">The translator maps each incoming RPP (resp. DCC) message into an outgoing DCC (resp. RPP) message, and possibly establishes or updates local state that is associated with the session. The translated (i.e., outgoing) message is a function of the incoming message as well as existing state that is associated with the current session. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix B.p.6">Translation occurs on an attribute-by-attribute basis. Certain attributes are translated without consideration of local per-session state. Other attributes, namely those that are bound to a particular session, require such consideration. The translation agent has to identify the session (and possibly subsession) an incoming message belongs to in order to consult the appropriate local per-session state. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix B.p.7">Note that certain DCC attributes cannot be translated due to their semantics not being present in RPP, and vice versa. This results in the messages, in which these attributes occur, not being delivered to their intended destination. In such cases it is desirable to inform the originator about the failure and terminate the session.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix B.p.8">In each scenario (i.e., RPP client / DCC AAA infrastructure and DCC client / RPP AAA infrastructure), the translator operates in two directions, namely RPP to DCC and vice versa. In the following sections, the notation c-&gt;s means that the attribute in question may occur only in the direction from the client to the server. The notation s-&gt;c denotes the converse and the notation c&lt;-&gt;s denotes that the attribute may occur in messages that are directed in either direction. </p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.Appendix B.1">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20B.1">Appendix B.1.</a> <a href="#trsid" id="trsid">Session Identification</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix B.1.p.1">The translation agent has to keep per-session state in order to perform its task. A session may be identified based on the RPP identifier or the DCC session identifier. That is, the translation agent should always maintain a pair of (RPP, DCC) session identifiers and maintain the per-session state in association with that pair. This per-session state must be addressable by either of these two identifiers. Moreover, an RPP session identifier must uniquely correspond to a DCC identifier. (If this holds, the converse also holds.) Each subsession identifier within an RPP session must also uniquely correspond to a subsession identifier within its corresponding DCC session. (If this holds the converse also holds.) </p>

<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20B.2">Appendix B.2.</a> <a href="#trRPP2DCC" id="trRPP2DCC">Translation between RADIUS Prepaid and Diameter Credit Control</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix B.2.p.1">This section describes the translator in the "RPP client / DCC AAA infrastructure" case. In other words, in this section it is assumed that the client "talks" RPP and the AAA inftrastructure "talks" DCC. The translator is assumed to sit somewhere in the middle and to mediate between client and server.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix B.2.p.2">For each RPP AVP (i.e., AVPs that are specified in the present document), the transformation into a semantically equivalent DCC AVP (if such an AVP exists), along with what per-session state the translator has to create or consult, is described. For clarity of exposition, each RPP AVP is addressed in a separate subsection. Since in this scenario, the PPC is typically the initiator a session, the focus is on the RPP AVPs.</p>

<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20B.2.1">Appendix B.2.1.</a> <a href="#trppac" id="trppac">PPAC (c&lt;-&gt;s)</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix B.2.1.p.1">A DCC client is assumed to always support Volume metering, Duration metering, Resource metering, Pools, Rating groups, and Tariff Switching.  Thus, if a PPAQ that indicates any of the above is sent client-&gt;server, the translator does the following: It lets message go through but remembers what exactly the client supports. If the server later requests (servier -&gt; client direction) an unsupported metering to be performed, send failure to server and cause the session to be terminated at the client. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix B.2.1.p.2">If a PPAC indicates support for multiple services (0x00000020), the translator maps this onto a DCC Multiple-Services- Indicator AVP. </p>

<a href="#rfc.appendix.Appendix%20B.2.2">Appendix B.2.2.</a> <a href="#trstc" id="trstc">Service Termination Attribute (c-&gt;s)</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix B.2.2.p.1">The Diameter base protocol assumes that the client always supports dynamic session termination. If this AVP is present, the translator does not need to do anything, i.e., there exists no DCC AVP that this AVP can be mapped to.  If this AVP is absent, the message in which it appears should either be discarded and originator should be informed of a failure, or the message can be passed on (without this AVP being mapped onto a DCC AVP). However, in the latter case, the translator has to remember that the client does not support dynamic termination. Thus, the translatior has to initiate the normal session termination procedure with the client when (if) dynamic termination is later initiated by the server. </p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix B.2.3.p.1">When quota is allocated for the first time by the DCC server, the translator has to create a QID AVP, as required by this specification. The translator later uses a QID AVP that is sent in the client-to-server direction in order to identify the corresponding DCC session. The QID has to be saved in the translator's per session state.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.Appendix B.2.4.p.2">If this AVP occurs in a message that is sent in the client-to-server direction, then it is translated into a Used-Service-Unit AVP with an embedded CC-Total-Octets AVP. Note that only the difference between current cumulative quota for the (sub)session and the quota in incoming messages is indicated in the translated DCC message. Local state is updated with cumulative consumed resources.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix B.2.4.p.3">Conversely, if the server grants quota using the DCC Granted-Service-Unit AVP with an embedded CC-Total-Octets AVP, then the translation agent must translate this into a Volume Quota Attribute.

In RPP, on the other hand, the server may optionally include a threshold AVP, as an indication to the PPC about when to ask for quota replenishment. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix B.2.9.p.2">Thus, in this scenario, there is no need for the translator to ever include a threshold attribute into the messages that it sends to the PPC.

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Pre-initialization: No action/value defined. </li>
<li>Initial Request: Typically an "intial interrogation" is triggered as a result of the reception of the message that contains this Update Reason AVP. Hence, CC-Request-Type AVP indicates "INITIAL_REQUEST". </li>
<li>Threshold Reached: The reception of the message containing this Update Reason AVP typically triggers an "intermediate interrogation". Hence, CC-Request-Type AVP indicates "UPDATE_REQUEST". </li>
<li>Quota Reached: The reception of the message containing this Update Reason AVP typically triggers an "intermediate interrogation".  Hence, CC-Request-Type AVP indicates "UPDATE_REQUEST". </li>
<li>TITSU Approaching: The reception of the message containing this Update Reason AVP typically triggers an "intermediate interrogation". Hence, CC-Request-Type AVP indicates "UPDATE_REQUEST". </li>
<li>Remote Forced Disconnect: Reception of such an Update Reason indicates that the client has terminated the session. The corresponding value for the CC-Request-Type AVP is "TERMINATION_REQUEST". </li>
<li>Client Service Termination: Reception of such an Update Reason indicates that the client has terminated the session. The corresponding value for the CC-Request-Type AVP is "TERMINATION_REQUEST". </li>
<li>"Access Service" Terminated: Reception of such an Update Reason indicates that the client has terminated the session. The corresponding value for the CC-Request-Type AVP is "TERMINATION_REQUEST". </li>
<li>Service not established: Reception of such an Update Reason indicates that the client has terminated the session. The corresponding value for the CC-Request-Type AVP is "TERMINATION_REQUEST". </li>
<li>One-Time Charging: Such an Update Reason indicates that a one-time charging event is initiated by the client. The corresponding value for the CC-Request-Type AVP is "EVENT_REQUEST". Note that a "Requested-Action: AVP MUST also be included in the outgoing DCC message. Typically, this would be of the type "DIRECT_DEBITING", or "REFUND_ACCOUNT", depending on other AVPs present in the message.</li>

Instead, it repeats those values that it receives from the AAA infrastructure, in this scenario from the translator. This attribute is therefore not used in a translation scenario. Nevertheless, the translator must make sure that messages about the same RPP session are forwarded to the same DCC server, throughout the whole session.

Depending on the configuration, this AVP may contain the same value on both the RPP and the DCC side of the communication. If, however, static rating groups are configured between the RCC client and the translator, and different rating groups between the DCC server and the translator, then the translator has to maintain a static translation table for the rating group identifier.

In this scenario (RPP client and DCC AAA infrastructure), a DCC "Final-Unit-Action" AVP is translated into a "Termination-Action" AVP. The following list contains the possible "Final-Unit-Action" values along with their "Termination-Action" equivalent.</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>TERMINATE (DCC): This value has a direct equivalent in RPP, also called "Terminate".</li>
<li>REDIRECT (DCC): If this value appears in a "Final-Unit-Action" AVP, then a "Redirect-Server-Address" AVP must also appear in the same DCC message. The translator translates these two AVPs into a "Termination-Action" with value "Redirect/Filter" and an eqiovalent NAS-Filter-Rule attribute (specified in http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-radext-ieee802-00.txt). </li>
<li>RESTRICT_ACCESS (DCC): If this value appears in a "Final-Unit-Action" AVP, then a "Restriction-Filter-Rule" AVP must also appear in the same DCC message. The translator translates these two AVPs into a "Termination-Action" with value "Redirect/Filter" and an eqiovalent Filter-ID attribute (specified in http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-radext-ieee802-00.txt). </li>
<li>In the absence of a "Final-Unit-Action" AVP, the DCC server assumes that the DCC client will ask for replenishment of quota at some suitable time. In RPP, this is explicitly conveyed via a "Termination-Action" AVP with the value "Request More Quota". Thus, in the absence of a "Final-Unit-Action" AVP, the translator in this scenario appends such an AVP into the outgoing RPP message.</li>
