Internet-Draft            RELOAD IPTV Usage              February 2009 
    

Abstract 

   This document defines a distributed IPTV Usage for Resource Location 
   And Discovery (RELOAD). The IPTV Usage provides lookup service for 
   IPTV channel information and IPTV metadata stored in the overlay. The 
   Attach method is used to establish a direct connection between a 
   distributed channel manager and a viewer. IPTV control messages are 
   exchanged through this connection.

1. Overview 

   RELOAD provides distributed storage and distributed service [I-
   D.ietf-p2psip-base]. RELOAD does not only support SIP based VoIP 
   service but also other services. This IPTV (Internet Protocol 
   Television) Usage of RELOAD allows RELOAD to store IPTV related 
   information within the overlay.  

   The following figure illustrates a distributed IPTV system. The 
   network supporting the distributed IPTV service consists of a 
   Distributed Management Network, a Distributed Delivery network, and 
   some additional servers. The Distributed Delivery Network consists of 
   media Relays for the overlay multicast network. A Contents Provider 
   who wants to broadcast its own IPTV contents, registers its contents 
   information to one of Channel Managers in the Distributed Management 
   Network. The Channel Manager manages a Contents Provider, Relays, and 
   Viewers for the IPTV channel. The Channel Manager controls media

   flows among Relays so that the contents of the Contents Provider are 
   delivered to the Viewers via the Relays. The Channel Manager uses a 
   specific protocol to control entities in a Distributed Delivery 
   Network. This protocol MAY be SIP(Session Initiation Protocol). The 
   Viewer who wants to watch a certain channel finds an appropriate 
   Channel Manager for the channel from the Distributed Management 
   Network. After a Viewer finds a Channel Manager, the Viewer connects 
   to the Channel Manager. The Channel Manager allows Viewers to receive 
   contents from the Relays.

                 Figure 1 Distributed IPTV Usage Overview. 

   In the distributed IPTV service, there is one channel manager for one 
   channel logically. A Channel Manager manages Viewer list and forms a 
   media delivery tree. The IPTV Usage of RELOAD distributes channel 
   managers to the overlay. A Viewer who wants to watch a certain IPTV 
   channel looks up a corresponding Channel Manager for the channel from 
   the overlay, and establishes a connection to the Channel Manager. 
   Also, IPTV Usage for RELOAD allows a node to look up channel 
   information with a certain keyword or a category from the overlay. 

   For example, if Bob is a Contents Provider and Alice is a Viewer who 
   wants to watch Bob's channel, it works as the following sequence. 

   1. First, Bob makes a channel ID "ch-b1" and hashes it to the Hashed 
      Channel ID "3333" using a consistent hash function like SHA-1. Bob 
      fills additional information about this channel. Bob sends RELOAD 
      StoreReq message to store channel information within the overlay. 
      This channel information contains Channel-ID, Title, Contents 
      Provider Node-ID, and optionally Application Server Node-ID.

Internet-Draft            RELOAD IPTV Usage              February 2009 
    

   2. Assume that Charlie(PeerID 3344) is the responsible peer of the 
      hashed Channel ID "3333". Charlie stores this channel information 
      and works as a Channel Manager for this "ch-b1" channel. 

   3. The Channel Manager, Charlie distributes the metadata about this 
      channel within the overlay. The Channel Manager hashes keywords in 
      metadata and stores them within the overlay. For example, if the 
      title description of this channel is "Bob's Live Show", the 
      channel manager divides this title to "Bob", "Live", and "Show". 
      The channel manager hashes each word and stores each partial 
      metadata within the overlay. This partial metadata contains 
      description type, full description of this type and a Hashed 
      Channel ID. 

   4. Now, the Viewer, Alice (Node ID "5678") inputs the keyword, "Live 
      Show" to find a channel. Alice divides the keyword into "Live" and 
      "Show" and sends two RELOAD FetchReqs to the overlay. And, it 
      finds "Bob's Live Show". The result of the FetchReq has Hashed 
      Channel ID. 

   5. Alice can see the channel list from the results. This channel list 
      consists of channels which have the title including "Live" and 
      "Show". Alice chooses "Bob's Live Show" from the channel list. 
      Alice sends RELOAD FetchReq with the Hashed Channel ID. From the 
      result of the FetchReq, Alice gets the Channel Manager Node-ID. 

   6. Alice sends AttachReq to the Channel Manager. Now, She can connect 
      to the Channel Manager, Charlie. 

   7. According to Channel Management Mechanism, Channel Manager, 
      Charlie, sends AttachReq to the contents providers, Bob.  

   8. After that, Alice, Bob, and Charlie exchange a certain IPTV Media 
      Delivery Network Control Protocol messages.

   As SIP Usage for RELOAD[I-D.ietf-p2psip-sip], RELOAD's role in a 
   distributed IPTV system is forming a direct connection between a 
   Channel Manager and a Contents Provider, or between a Channel Manager 
   and a Viewer.  

   The application field in a AttachReq message SHOULD be a specific 
   Media Delivery Network Control Protocol's port number. This document 
   doesn't define IPTV Media Delivery Network Control Protocol. 

   A Channel Manager or all nodes in RELOAD may use private IP address. 
   Therefore, the IPTV Usage exchanges ICE Candidates using RELOAD

Internet-Draft            RELOAD IPTV Usage              February 2009 
    

   AttachReq/Ans messages. To do NAT traversal, IPTV Nodes MAY use TURN 
   Service which RELOAD provides. 

   IPTV Usage allows the RELOAD overlay to be a distributed IPTV channel 
   manager and a distributed IPTV metadata storage. The major actions 
   are summarized to the following 5 actions. 

   o Registering contents providers' IPTV channel information with the 
      overlay and assigning a channel manager for the channel. 

   o Registering IPTV metadata with the overlay. 

   o Looking up a IPTV channel from metadata. 

   o Looking up the Channel Manager. 

   o Forming a direct connection to the Channel Manager. 

    

2. Terminology 

    

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 

   The concepts used in this document are compatible with "Concepts and 
   Terminology for Peer to Peer SIP" [I-D.ietf-p2psip-concepts] and the 
   P2PSIP base protocol RELOAD[I-D.ietf-p2psip-base]. 

   Channel : a media stream from a contents provider to Viewers. There 
   may be some Relays between a Contents Provider and Viewers. 

   Channel ID : a global unique ID which identifies a certain Channel. 
   It may be a human readable ID. 

   Hashed Channel ID : a result of hash function of Channel ID. To store 
   channel information to the overlay, channel ID should be hashed. 

   Contents Provider : a source entity which produces media for a 
   Channel. 

   Viewer : a entity which receives media from a Contents Provider or a 
   Relay.

Internet-Draft            RELOAD IPTV Usage              February 2009 
    

   Relay : a entity helps to deliver media from Contents Provider to 
   Viewers. A Contents Provider or Viewer can be a Relay. 

   Channel Manager : a entity manages a Channel. It keeps Contents 
   Provider information and Viewer list. It controls media delivery 
   network while forming a media delivery tree. A Viewer can be a relay 
   in media delivery network according to Media Delivery Network Control 
   Protocol. Channel Manager is similar to a tracker in BitTorrent. 

   Application Server : an additional entity which work together with a 
   channel manager to make a certain service. 

   Media Delivery Network Control Protocol : a protocol which control 
   media delivery tree. It makes a node to send media somewhere or to 
   receive from somewhere. SIP(Session Initialization Protocol) can be a 
   candidate of this protocol. 

   Metadata : All descriptions and information about a certain channel. 
   It contains title, category, language, credit, and so on. It may be 
   used to find a certain channel. 

   User : a person handles a certain agent. 

   Agent : a entity helps an User. There are Contents Provider Agent and 
   Viewer Agent. 

3. Registering IPTV information 

   If a Contents Provider wants to make its own IPTV channel, it MUST 
   make a Channel ID, and describes this Channel. And, it MUST register 
   this channel into the overlay. 

   This document does not define the way to make a Channel ID. But, a 
   Channel-ID MUST be a global unique ID. 

3.1. Registering IPTV Channel information 

   In ordinary centralized IPTV, a contents provider registers its 
   channel information to an IPTV server. However, in distributed IPTV, 
   a Contents Provider registers its channel information to the overlay. 
   To register its channel information, a RELOAD peer stores 
   IptvChanInfo structure with its channel ID. This uses IPTV-CHANINFO 
   Kind-ID, which is formally defined in Section 5.  

   All Peers in RELOAD SHOULD work as an IPTV server. The responsible 
   peer of the channel ID SHOULD work as a Channel Manager. The Channel

Internet-Draft            RELOAD IPTV Usage              February 2009 
    

   Manager manages all nodes which attend this channel. And, it controls 
   these nodes to form a media delivery tree.  

   For a simple example, if a channel ID is "diptv:bob_livetv_show" and 
   the hashed channel ID is "1234", the responsible peer "1200" should 
   store channel information and work as a Channel Manager. Other 
   viewers can contact the channel manager using the Hashed Channel ID.  

   The Contents provider or the responsible peer of a certain channel ID 
   MAY choose another peer than the responsible peer as a Channel 
   Manager. This draft does not define the method of assigning other 
   channel manager. But, we MAY use random searching in the overlay. 

   The contents of a IptvChanInfo structure are as follows: 

     struct { 
        opaque          title<0..2^16-1>; 
        opaque          synopsis<0..2^16-1>; 
        opaque          genre<0..2^16-1>; 
        opaque          language<0..2^16-1>; 
        opaque          cast<0..2^16-1>; 
        opaque          group<0..2^16-1>; 
        opaque          credit<0..2^16-1>; 
        opaque          review<0..2^16-1>; 
        opaque          crid<0..2^16-1>; 
     } ContentsDescription; 
      
     struct { 
        uint64           start_time; 
        uint64           finish_time; 
        opaque          contents_provider_name<0..2^16-1>; 
        opaque          URL<0..2^16-1>; 
        opaque          logo<0..2^16-1>; 
     } InstanceDescription; 
      
     struct { 
        opaque             channel_id<0..2^16-1>; 
       ContentsDescription contents_desc; 
       InstanceDescription instance_desc; 
       Destination        contents_provider; 
       Destination        channel_manager; 
       Destination        application_server_list<0..2^16-1>; 
     } IptvChanInfo;

  channel_id 
      The identifier of the channel. A unhashed ID 
    

   contents_desc 
      Descriptions, category, types, and contents related information of 
   a Channel 
    

   instance_desc 
     Start,finish time, and instance related information of a Channel 
    

   contents_provider

   channel_manager 
     Channel Manager's NodeID to attach 
    

   application_server_list 
     Additional application server Node ID list 
    

   The contents descriptions and instance descriptions are inherited 
   from [TVAF]. 

   In order to prevent hijacking, registrations are subject to access 
   control rule. Before a StoreReq is permitted, the storing peer MUST 
   check that the certificate contains a Node-ID that is the same as the 
   Contents Provider ID in the message. 

   Note that this rule permits only a Contents Provider to register, 
   modify, or delete this channel information. 

    

3.2. Registering IPTV Metadata 

   The other user does not know a registered channel ID. It should be 
   possible to look up a certain channel with keywords. Additional 
   information about the channel is metadata. The Channel Manager MAY 
   register metadata about the channel with the overlay. To register 
   metadata, a RELOAD peer stores IptvMetadata structure. IptvMetadata 
   contains keyword and channel id as major information. This is used by 
   IPTV-METADATA Kind-ID, which is formally defined in Section 6. 
 
 
Seokkap, et al.        Expires August 21, 2009                [Page 9] 

Internet-Draft            RELOAD IPTV Usage              February 2009 
    

   The Channel Manager hashes each keyword to resource-IDs and stores 
   these partial metadata within the overlay using StoreReq. All RELOAD 
   peers MUST have storage for this metadata. The results of fetching a 
   metadata are used to make a keyword matching list. 

   Note that the Contents Provider MAY store metadata but some scenarios 
   does not want to expose the Contents Provider to normal users. 

   As a simple example above, if the title of a channel is "Bob's live 
   talk show", the Channel Manager MAY make 4 words as title metadata 
   keywords.  It hashes each word and stores each title metadata keyword 
   with the overlay. Each metadata will be stored in distributed peers. 

   The contents of a IptvMetadata structure are as follows: 

     enum { 
      iptv_metakeyword_contdesc_title(1), 
      iptv_metakeyword_contdesc_synopsys(2), 
      iptv_metakeyword_contdesc_genre(3), 
      iptv_metakeyword_contdesc_language(4), 
      iptv_metakeyword_contdesc_cast(5), 
      iptv_metakeyword_contdesc_group(6), 
      iptv_metakeyword_contdesc_credit(7), 
      iptv_metakeyword_contdesc_review(8), 
      iptv_metakeyword_contdesc_crid(9), 
     } IptvMetadataType; 
      
     struct { 
        IptvMetadataType   type;  
       opaque             keyword<0..2^16-1>; 
       opaque             description<0..2^16-1>; 
        opaque             channel_id<0..2^16-1>; 
       ResourceID         hashed_channel_id; 
       Destination         .annel_manager; 
     } IptvMetadata; 
    

   The contents of the IptvMetadata PDU are: 

   type 
     the description type of the metadata keyword

   description 
     full description. This description contains the keywords. 
    

   channel_id 
     the unhashed channel id 
    

   hashed_channel_id 
     the hashed channel_id to fetch more channel information 
    

   channel_manager 
     the channel_manager Node-Id which controls this channel 
    

   The data model for the IPTV metadata Kind-ID is an array. Because 
   Resource ID is derived from a keyword, it may cause a collision. But, 
   the metadata record will be accumulated because the data model is 
   array. 

   In order to prevent hijacking, before a StoreReq is permitted, the 
   storing peer MUST check if the certificate contains Node-ID is the 
   same as the channel_manager Node-Id in the message. 

    

4. Looking up IPTV information 

   When a Viewer wishes to look up a certain channel with some keywords, 
   she follows the following procedure.  

   1. A Viewer User inputs keywords per a description type. 

   2. The Viewer Agent hashes the inputted keywords and looks up IPTV 
   metadata from the overlay. 

   3. The Viewer Agent shows the look-up result in order. The result is 
   a list of channels. 

   4. The Viewer User chooses one item in the list. The Viewer Agent 
   attaches the corresponding Channel Manager. 

   5. The Channel Manager controls the Contents Provider, Relays, and 
   Viewers to deliver the media stream from the Contents Provider to 
   Viewers. Consequently, the Contents Provider sends media to a Relay. 
   Relay sends received media to Viewer Agent.

4.1. Looking up IPTV Metadata 

   A Viewer makes ResourceID with hashing the user inputted keyword and 
   Description Type (IptvMetadataType). The Viewer sends FetchReq which 
   contains a ResourceID and a Kind-ID. The Kind-ID in the FetchReq is 
   IPTV-METADATA.  

   The Viewer can get the result of searching a specific keyword with 
   IptvMetadataType. The result contains the full description for 
   specified metadata type and the Hashed Channel ID. The Viewer MAY get 
   more information about this channel with sending FetchReq which 
   contains a Hashed Channel ID as a Destination ID. 

4.2. Looking up IPTV Channel information 

   If a Viewer knows Channel ID, the Viewer can get a Hashed Channel ID 
   with hashing a Channel ID. Also, a Viewer can get Hashed Channel ID 
   through the metadata searching. A Viewer sends FetchReq which has the 
   Hashed Channel ID as Destination ID. The responsible peer of the 
   Hashed Channel ID responds with FetchAns. The FetchAns has Channel 
   Manager Node-ID. 

4.3. Forming a Direct Connection 

   If a node knows Channel Manager Node-ID, the node can send AttachReq 
   which has Channel Manager Node-ID as a Destination. The application 
   field in this AttachReq MUST be a certain IPTV Media Delivery Network 
   Control Protocol's port number. If a nodes support only ICE-lite, 
   AttachLiteReq MUST be used instead of AttachReq.  

   AttachReq contains requester's ICE candidates. AttachAns contains 
   responder's ICE candidates. After exchanging ICE candidates, they 
   perform ICE checking[I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice] and establish a connection 
   for IPTV Media Delivery Network Control Protocol. 

    

5. IPTV-CHANINFO Kind Definition 

   The distributed IPTV channel information is provided using the IPTV-
   CHANINFO Kind-ID: 

   o Kind ID - The Resource Name for the IPTV-CHANINFO is Channel ID. 
      The data stored is a IptvChanInfo, which contains channel manager 
      ID, channel description, and additional information.

   o Data Model - The data model for the IPTV-CHANINFO is single. A 
      Channel has only one IPTV-CHANINFO. 

   o Access Control - If certificate-based access control is used, 
      stored data of Kind-ID IPTV-CHANINFO must be signed by certificate 
      which contains Node-ID matching the Contents Provider Node-ID. 

    

6. IPTV-METADATA Kind Definition 

   The distributed IPTV metadata is provided using the IPTV-METADATA 
   Kind-ID: 

   o Kind ID - The Resource Name for the IPTV-METADATA is 
      IptvMetadataType and keyword. The format of Resource name is : 

      IptvMetadataType "+" Keyword 

      The IptvMetadataType in Resource Name is a character string. For 
      example, if the IptvMetadataType  is 
      iptv_metakeyword_contdesc_title and the keyword is "Bob", the 
      resource name is "1+Bob".  The stored data is a IptvMetadata, 
      which contains one of description and Channel ID. 

   o Data Model - The data model for the IPTV-METADATA is Array. There 
      MAY be many records with the same Resource-ID. 

   o Access Control - If certificate-based access control is being used, 
      stored data of Kind-ID IPTV-METADATA must be signed by certificate 
      which contains Node-ID matching the Channel Manager Node-ID. 

    

7. Security Considerations

8. IANA Considerations 

   IANA SHALL add IPTV-CHANINFO and IPTV-METADATA into "RELOAD Data 
   Kind-ID" Registry, which is defined in Section 14.2 Data Kind-ID in 
   [I-D.ietf-p2psip-base]. The additional contents of the registry are:
