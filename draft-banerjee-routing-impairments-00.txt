2. Abstract 
    
   In the not too distant future, signals carried between two endpoints 
   will be transmitted in an all-optical domain over a multi-hop path. 
   Such transparent networks consist of photonic switches, optical 
   add/drop multiplexers, optical amplifiers, optical regenerators, and 
   fiber. Signaling for such routes needs to account for optical 
   impairments in the path. This draft discusses a number of optical 
   parameters and proposes optical constraints as enhancements to the 
   routing protocols (for a subset of the parameters).

3. Introduction 
    
   Recently, a lot of work has been done to use the Generalized MPLS 
   control plane [ABB01] to dynamically provision resources and to 
   provide network survivability using protection and restoration 
   techniques for all-optical networks. The optical networks presently 
   being deployed may be called "opaque"  ([TGN98]) - each link is 
   optically isolated by transponders doing O/E/O conversions from 
   other links. These transponders are quite expensive and they also 
   constrain the rapid evolution to new services - for example, they 
   tend to be bit rate and format specific. Thus there are strong 
   motivators to introduce "domains of transparency" - all-optical 
   networks. Such _transparent_ networks consist of photonic switches, 
   optical add/drop multiplexers, optical amplifiers, optical 
   regenerators, and fiber.  
 
   Current proposals on routing protocol extensions (see [KRB01a] and 
   [KRB01b]) consider opaque networks where all routes have adequate 
   signal quality. Here, we consider all-optical networks. In order to 
   take full advantages of potential cost and operational efficiencies 
   offered by the all-optical networks, we assume that a domain of 
   transparency may be too large to ensure that all potential routes 
   have adequate signal quality for all connections. In order to obtain 
   paths for the connections, physical impairments of various links in 
   the all-optical network need to be accounted for. Our goal is to 
   understand the impacts of the various types of impairments in this 
   environment and to recommend a practical set of parameters that need 
   to be accounted for. This necessitates enhancing the routing 
   protocols to advertise the selected attributes which are necessary 
   to compute constrained shortest paths. 
 
   The organization of the remainder of this document is as follows.  
   In Section 4, we discuss the various optical parameters that may 
   need to be announced. Furthermore, we outline the TLVs for the 
   (specifically for the OSPF and IS-IS routing protocols) parameters 
   that are to be flooded into the routing database. 
    
4. Optical Parameters 
    
   In this section, we identify the various attributes that are 
   potential candidates for being flooded using the routing protocols. 
   We are only concerned with the impairments that may have impacts on 
   possible routes chosen through a transparent network. According to 
   the requirements specified in [CST00], we account for two key linear 
   impairments, namely Polarization Mode Dispersion (PMD) and Optical 
   Signal to Noise Ratio (OSNR). There are other performance related 
   parameters, e.g., modulator extinction ratio, jitter, Q-factor, etc 
   outlined in [CBD00], that need to be taken into account when 
   designing the transmission system. These parameters are either not 
   route dependent, or implicitly reflected by the PMD and OSNR 
   constraints or included in the OSNR margin described in section 4.3.     
    
4.1. Polarization Mode Dispersion (PMD) 
    
 draft-banerjee-optical-impairments-00.txt                   March 2001    
   PMD management requires that the time-average differential group 
   delay (DGD) between two orthogonal state of polarizations, tau be 
   less than a fraction a of the bit duration, T = 1/B, where B is the 
   bit rate. The value of a depends on three major factors, 1) margin 
   allocated to PMD, e.g., 1dB; 2) targeting outage probability, e.g., 
   4x10-5; 3) sensitivity of receiver to DGD. A typical value for a is 
   0.1[ITU].  
 
   Assume that the transparent segment consists of K links, with each 
   link k having a PMD value of tau(k). The PMD value of a link tau(k) 
   is a function of the length and fiber PMD parameter of each fiber 
   span on the link. The constraint on overall path PMD becomes the sum 
   of squares of the PMD parameter across all links to be less than 
   a^2/B^2. Hence, for routing constraint checking purposes regarding 
   PMD, the only link dependent information that needs to be propagated 
   or is tau(k)^2 (the square of the polarization mode dispersion).  
    
   In OSPF, the PMD parameter is represented as a sub-TLV of the Link 
   TLV in the Traffic Engineering LSA, with type 15. The length of the 
   sub-TLV is four-octets and specifies the square of the polarization 
   mode dispersion (in IEEE floating point format, the unit being pico 
   seconds squared). The format of the PMD sub-TLV is as shown: 
    
     0                   1                   2                   3 
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    |  Type = 15                    |         Length = 4            | 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |            Polarization Mode Dispersion Square                | 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
    
   In IS-IS, we enhance the sub-TLVs for the extended IS reachability 
   TLV. The length of the PMD sub-TLV is four-octets and specifies the 
   square of the polarization mode dispersion (in IEEE floating point 
   format, the unit being pico seconds squared). Specifically, we add 
   the following sub-TLV: 
        Sub-TLV type  Length(in bytes)   Name 
           21           4              PMD Type 
                     
4.2 Optical Signal to Noise Ratio (OSNR) 
    
   Amplifier Spontaneous Emission (ASE) degrades the signal to noise 
   ratio. An acceptable optical SNR level (SNRmin) which depends on the 
   bit rate, transmitter-receiver technology (e.g., FEC), and margins 
   allocated for other impairments, needs to be maintained at the 
   receiver. Vendors currently provide OTS engineering rules defining 
   maximum span length and number of spans that ensure that all routes 
   meet this requirement. For larger transparent domains, more detailed 
   OSNR computations will be needed to determine whether the OSNR level 
   on a given all-optical service or restoration route has acceptable 
   OSNR.   
    
 draft-banerjee-optical-impairments-00.txt                   March 2001    
   
   Assume P is the average optical power launched at the transmitter, 
   and each link k generates noise power N(k). The OSNR constraint for 
   path computation becomes the sum of the noise power across all links 
   in the path must be less than P/ SNRmin.  
    
   In OSPF, the Noise parameter is represented as a sub-TLV of the Link 
   TLV in the Traffic Engineering LSA, with type 16. The length of the 
   sub-TLV is four-octets and specifies the noise power (in IEEE 
   floating point format, the unit being dBm). The format of the Noise 
   sub-TLV is as shown: 

     0                   1                   2                   3 
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    |  Type = 16                    |         Length = 4            | 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                      Noise Parameter                          | 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    
   In IS-IS, we enhance the sub-TLVs for the extended IS reachability 
   TLV. The length of the noise sub-TLV is four-octets and specifies 
   the noise power of the link (in IEEE floating point format, the unit 
   being dBm ). Specifically, we add the following sub-TLV: 
        Sub-TLV type  Length(in bytes)   Name 
           21           4              Noise parameter Type 
    
    
    
4.3 OSNR Margin and Receiver OSNR requirements 
    
   As an additional constraint, a network-wide margin on the OSNR 
   accounts for a number of other additional parameters that are not 
   spelled out explicitly in the above TLVs. For example, other major 
   impairments are: 
   1. Polarization-Dependent Loss (PDL): It is required that the total 
      PDL on the path to be within some acceptable limit, typically 1dB 
      margin in OSNR.  
   2. Chromatic Dispersion:  In general, this impairment can be 
      adequately (but not optimally) compensated for on a per-link 
      basis, and/or at system initial setup time. 
   3. Crosstalk: Since crosstalk in the system affects Q, it can be 
      factored in with some margin in Q. As a result, one can increase 
      the OSNR requirement by some modified margin. 
   4. Nonlinear Impairments: One could assume that nonlinear 
      impairments are bounded and increase the required OSNR level by X 
      dB, where X for performance reasons would be limited to 1 or 2 
      dB, consequently setting a limit on the maximum number of spans. 
      For the approach described here to be useful, it is desirable for 
      this span limit to be longer than that imposed by the constraints 
      which can be treated explicitly. 
    
   Furthermore, it is assumed that all nodes in the network have a 
   table of the minimum value of the OSNR required to transmit 
 draft-banerjee-optical-impairments-00.txt                   March 2001    

   information at a specified bit rate for a given transceiver 
   technology (e.g. FEC).  
    
 
5. Security Considerations 
    
   The enhancements do not introduce any additional security 
   considerations.
