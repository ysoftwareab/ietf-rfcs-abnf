   has defined that a wavelength label (section 3.2.1.1) "only has 
   significance between two neighbors".  However, in a network composed 
   of a new generation of lambda switch-capable equipment, this document 
   explains new models that require standardization of the label.  It 
   highlights new operator requirements and describes signaling and 
   routing extensions to satisfy those requirements. 

   This document is a companion to the Generalized Multi-Protocol Label

1. Introduction 

   As described in [RFC3945], Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) extends MPLS from 
   supporting only packet (Packet Switching Capable - PSC) interfaces 
   and switching to also include support for four new classes of 
   interfaces and switching: Layer-2 Switch Capable (L2SC), Time-
   Division Multiplex (TDM), Lambda Switch Capable (LSC) and Fiber-

   Switch Capable (FSC).  A functional description of the extensions to 
   MPLS signaling needed to support new classes of interfaces and 
   switching is provided in [RFC3471]. 

   This document presents details that are specific to the use of GMPLS 
   with a new generation of Lambda Switch Capable (LSC) equipment.  
   Technologies such as Reconfigurable Optical Add/Drop Multiplex 
   (ROADM) operate at the wavelength switching level.  As such, the 
   wavelength is important information that is necessary to set up a 
   wavelength LSP successfully.

            Figure 1 Interconnecting ROADMs between two domains 

   Consider the architecture described in Figure 1.  This architecture 
   shows two domains A and B.  In domain A, there are two wavelength 
   switches, connected through WDM.  So is the case in domain B. At the 
   interface between domains A and B is a battery of G.709 transponders.  
   These transponders are operated in domain A.  The wavelengths coming 
   from domain B to the G.709 transponders are considered alien 
   wavelengths.  G.709 Transponders can support tunable lasers on both 
   sides and as is seen in the figure, only one node needs to provide 
   the G.709 interfacing capability.  The alien wavelength is a narrow 
   band optical signal provided by a 3rd party node.  This setup 
   simplifies the network design vs. the use of transponders on each of 
   the domain A and domain B sides. 

   It is expected that a network design tool will compute wavelength 
   paths based on a number of optical constraints as well as wavelength

   availability.  The computation and communication of the results of 
   the computation are outside the scope of this draft.  The results of 
   the computation can be used as Explicit Route Object (ERO) for 
   signaling.   

   In the scenario of Figure 1, consider the setting up of a 
   bidirectional LSR from ingress switch 1 to egress switch 4.  A 
   certain wavelength (lambda-i) will be used in domain A up to the 
   G.709 transponder, whose tunable laser in domain A will be tuned to 
   lambda-i.  A Path message will be used for the signaling.  The Path 
   setup will continue downstream to switch 4.  The tunable laser facing 
   downstream at the G.709 transponder need not be tuned immediately.  
   Note that the Path message may contain a Label Set in the Path 
   message to indicate the tuning range of the laser but that's not a 
   requirement.  The nodes in domain B select a different wavelength 
   (lambda-i') for domain B.  The transponder ultimately needs to know 
   the wavelength it should tune to in the direction of the egress 
   switch 4.  The egress will then send back a Resv message toward 
   switch 1.  The Resv message will carry the wavelength information 
   (lambda-i') to the G.709 transponder using an Upstream Label.   

   This label allows the correct tuning of the lasers of the G.709 
   transponders in addition to being able to switch the correct 
   wavelength. 

   While previously, wavelength label information was only required 
   intra-domain, the label contents need to be used inter-domain in this 
   case. 

   In addition, for the intra-domain case, there are more motivations 
   for standardizing the wavelength label including: 

   1. Label Set:  A Label Set object may be used to limit the label 
      choices of a downstream node (section 3.5 of RFC 3471).  This 
      Label Set object needs to carry one of the labels defined in 
      section 3.2 of that same document, i.e. port, wavelength label or 
      waveband label.  In order to be able to generate that wavelength 
      information, it is important to have a common understanding of the 
      wavelength information.  

   2. Not using a standardized label would add undue burden on the 
      operator to enforce policy as each manufacturer may decide on a 
      different representation and therefore each domain may have its 
      own label formats. 

   3. Manual provisioning may lead to misconfiguration if domain-
      specific labels are used.

2. Changes from version -00 

   o  Removed the discussion about global meaning 

   o  Removed the use of the suggested IEEE format as it gives rounding 
      errors 

   o  Added co-author 

   o  Added an interoperability scenario that GMPLS should support 

   o  Added a section that clarifies operator requirements  

   o  Defined new sub-TLVs for advertising wavelength availability 

3. Operator Requirements on Label Identification 

   We list some operator requirements in this section. 

   1. A wavelength label SHOULD be standardized in order to allow 
      interoperability between multiple domains; otherwise appropriate 
      existing labels are identified in support of wavelength 
      availability. 

   2. The ITU-T frequency grid specified in [G.694.1] for Dense WDM 
      (DWDM) and wavelength information in [G.694.2] for Coarse WDM 
      (CWDM) SHOULD be used by LSC LSRs when setting up LSPs. 

   3. Labels SHOULD be stable and not allow for rounding errors  

   4. An operator MAY want to advertise wavelength availability in the 
      network 

   5. Care SHOULD be taken if advertising the wavelength availability in 
      order to reduce impact on the existing OSPF-TE. 

   6. To decrease the probability of operators' error or difficulties, 
      it is RECOMMENDED that advertising using OSPF-TE/ISIS-TE be 
      standardized to simplify management  

   7. Existing labels should be still utilized appropriately even if 
      wavelength availability is advertised. 

4. Label Related Formats 

   To deal with the widening scope of MPLS into the optical and time 
   domains, several new forms of "label" have been defined in [RFC3471].

   This section contains clarifications for the Wavelength label and 
   Label Set definition specific for LSC LSRs. 

4.1. Wavelength Labels 

   In section 3.2.1.1 of [RFC3471], a Wavelength label is defined to 
   have significance between two neighbors, and the receiver may need to 
   convert the received value into a value that has local significance. 

   LSC equipment uses multiple wavelengths controlled by a single 
   control channel.  In such case, the label indicates the wavelength to 
   be used for the LSP.  This document proposes to standardize the 
   wavelength label.  As an example of wavelength values, the reader is 
   referred to [G.694.1] which lists the frequencies from the ITU-T DWDM 
   frequency grid.  The same can be done for CWDM technology by using 
   the wavelength defined in [G.694.2]. 

   Since the ITU-T DWDM grid is based on nominal central frequencies, we 
   will indicate the appropriate table, the channel spacing in the grid 
   and a value n that allows the calculation of the frequency.  That 
   value can be positive or negative. 

   The frequency is calculated as such in [G.694.1]: 

   Frequency (THz) = 193.1 THz + n * channel spacing (THz) 

   Where 

      n is an integer (positive, negative or 0) 

      Channel spacing is defined to be 0.0125, 0.025, 0.05 or 0.1 THz 

   For the other example of the case of the ITU-T CWDM grid, the spacing 
   between different channels was defined to be 20nm, so we need to pass 
   the wavelength value in nm in this case.  Examples of CWDM 
   wavelengths are 1271, 1291, etc. nm. 

   The tables listed in [G.694.1] and [G.694.2] are not numbered and 
   change with the changing frequency spacing as technology advances, so 
   an index is not appropriate in this case. 

4.1.1. DWDM Wavelength Label 

   For the case of DWDM, the information carried in a Wavelength label 
   is:

   is:

   Integer value of lambda in nm 

   We do not need to define a new type as the information stored is 
   either a port label or a wavelength label.  Only the wavelength label 
   as above needs to be defined. 

5. Advertising Wavelength Availability 

   Wavelength availability may be thought of as a constraint in an 
   optical network and may also be thought of as bandwidth availability.  
   WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexing) is comparable to TDM (Time 
   Division Multiplexing).  But LSPs in WDM networks require bandwidth 
   continuity unlike SONET/SDH networks where TSI (Time Slot 
   Interchange) has allowed any-to-any mapping between slots.  The 
   corresponding wavelength conversion is not a simple matter and cannot 
   be done all-optically with currently deployed technology.  In 
   addition, another difference with SONET/SDH networks is that several 
   optical constraints have to be taken into consideration in computing 
   paths in addition to wavelength continuity.  Nevertheless, some of 
   the optical constraints are constant or node properties while others 
   may be manually configured (fiber distances, placement of EDFAs, 
   etc.). 

   Wavelength availability is therefore a bit different and while it may 
   be collected through an EMS/NMS system, operators may want to have it 
   advertised using GMPLS routing.  The objective of this section is to 
   standardize the information advertised using OSPF-TE and ISIS-TE if 
   an operator wishes to have it advertised. This allows the operator to 
   parse LSA information without regard to the applied policy in 
   different manufacturer domains.  

5.1. Wavelength Availability in OSPF-TE 

   We use an Opaque LSA to advertise in a new TE link sub-TLV the 
   availability of lambdas in one of the grids, by identifying the grid, 
   then setting a bit to 1 or 0 for each lambda entry if the lambda 
   exists or not.  Irregular lambdas have to be advertised in separate 
   sub-TLVs.

   Grid and lambda are as defined in section 4.1.  The smallest and 
   largest lambda are obviously the values for smallest and largest 
   wavelength respectively in the network. 

   R: 1 bit 

   Reserved 

   Mask size: 6 bits 

   Specifies the size of the wavelength mask in bits. 

   For each entry in the octets following, a bit set to 1 means the 
   wavelength is available; 0 means it is not. 

5.2. Wavelength Mask in ISIS-TE  

   In IS-IS/TE, we define new sub-TLVs for the extended IS reachability 
   TLV.  They carry the same information for irregular wavelengths as 
   well as wavelength masks as shown in 5.1.  

6. IANA Considerations 

   IANA is requested to assign two new sub-TLV types for irregular 
   wavelength and wavelength map. 

7. Security Considerations 

   This document introduces no new security considerations to either 
   [RFC3473] or [RFC3472]. GMPLS security is described in section 11 of 
   [RFC3471] and refers to [RFC3209] for RSVP-TE and to [RFC3212] for 
   CR-LDP. [RFC4203] specifies security considerations for OSPF-TE and 
   [RFC4205] specifies those for ISIS/TE.
