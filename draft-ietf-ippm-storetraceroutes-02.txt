Abstract

   This memo describes a standard way to store traceroute measurements.
   To better address the traceroute measurements storing issue, the
   authors first of all give a definition of the traceroute tool,
   describe the tool itself as well as its parameters and the default
   values on the most common operating systems and the output results

   that can be stored.  Afterwards, the common information model with
   the base elements of the traceroute measurement storing is defined
   dividing the information elements in two semantically separated
   groups (configuration elements and results ones).  Moreover an
   additional element is defined to relate configuration elements and
   results ones by means of a common unique identifier.  On the basis of
   the information model a data model is then proposed in order to
   actually store the traceroute measurements.

1.  Introduction

   Traceroutes are being used by lots of measurement efforts, either as
   an independent measurement or to get path information to support
   other measurement efforts.  That is why there is the need to
   standardize the way traceroute measurements are stored and the
   related metrics associated with such measurements.  Since traceroute
   is a tool that has built-in configurable mechanisms like time-outs
   and can experience problems related to the crossing of firewalls thus
   experiencing fake losses or incomplete delay information.  The
   standard metrics defined by IPPM working group in matter of delay,
   connectivity and losses do not apply to the metrics returned by the
   traceroute tool; therefore, in order to compare results of traceroute
   measurements, the solution is to add to the stored results a
   specification of the operating system and version for the tool used.
   Moreover there is a need to better define the traceroute tool as well
   as its parameters and the results it outputs since, to the authors'
   knowledge, there is so far no standard describing these.  These are
   the motivations that moved the authors to write this draft in the
   context of the IPPM working group even if other working groups (like
   DISMAN) have already addressed similar issues related to the
   definition of the MIB for configuring and retrieving traceroute
   measurements results.  This draft, in order to store traceroute
   results and allow comparison of them, defines a standard way to store
   traceroute measurements using a XML schema.  The draft is organised
   as follows: Section 2 gives the definition of traceroute used as
   reference in the rest of the draft as well as the traceroute
   configurable parameters and their default values for the most common
   operating systems.  Section 3 reports on both traceroute accuracy of
   results and existing alternatives for traceroute implementations.
   Section 4 describes the results available from the traceroute output
   screen.  Section 5 and Section 6 respectively describe our proposed
   Information model and Data model for storing traceroute measurements.
   Section 8 reports the differences to [RFC4560].  The draft ends with
   security considerations and IANA considerations in Section 9 and
   Section 10 respectively.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


2.  Definition of Traceroute

   Traceroute is a network diagnostic tool used to determine the hop by
   hop path from a source to a destination and the Round Trip Time (RTT)
   from the source to each hop.  Traceroute can therefore be used to
   discover where and how a host is connected to the Internet and can be

   usefully employed to troubleshoot network connections.

   Typically, traceroute attemps to discover the path to a destination
   by sending UDP probes with specific time-to-live (TTL) values in the
   IP packet header and trying to elicit an ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED response
   from each gateway along the path to some host.

   More in detail, the host running the traceroute sends the first set
   of probes with TTL equal to one (some implementations allow setting
   the initial TTL to a value equal to "n" different from one, so that
   the first "n-1" hops are skipped and the first hop that will be
   traced is the "n-th" in the path).  Upon receiving a probe, the first
   hop host decreases the TTL value by one.  By observing a TTL value
   equal to zero, the host rejects the probe and typically returns an
   ICMP message with a TIME_EXCEEDED value.  Traceroute can therefore
   derive the IP address of the first hop from the header of the ICMP
   message and evaluate the RTT between the source and the first hop.
   The next hops are discovered following the same procedure, taking
   care of increasing at each step the TTL value of the outgoing probes
   by one.  The TTL value is increased until either an ICMP
   PORT_UNREACHABLE message is received, meaning that the destination
   has been reached, or the maximum configured number of hops has been
   hit.

   Some implementations, use ICMP Echos, instead of UDP datagrams.
   However, many routers do not return ICMP messages about ICMP
   messages, i.e. no ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED is returned for an ICMP Echo.
   Therefore, in this draft we RECOMMEND to base implementations on UDP
   datagrams.

2.1.  Traceroute Configuration Parameters

   In order to define an information model for storing traceroutes, we
   first investigated which configuration parameters are relevant when
   running traceroute.  We considered four major traceroute
   implementations and compared them based on configurable parameters
   and default values.  The LINUX (SUSE 9.1), BSD (FreeBSD 7.0) and UNIX
   (SunOS 5.9) implemetations are based on UDP datagrams, while the
   WINDOWS (XP SP2) one uses ICMP Echos.  The comparison is summarized
   in the following table, where an N/A in the option column, means that
   such parameter is not configurable for the specific implementation.
   A comprehensive comparison of available implementations is outside
   the scope of this draft; however, already by sampling a few different
   implementations, we can observe that they can differ quite
   significantly in terms of configurable parameters and also default
   values.  Note that in the following table we reported only those
   options which are available in at least two of the considered
   implementations.

3.  Known Problems with Traceroute

3.1.  Accuracy of Results

   A known inconsistency exists between the round-trip delay metric
   defined by the IPPM working group and the results returned by the
   current traceroute implementations.  Unfortunately, it is unlikely
   that the traceroute implementations will implement the standard
   definition in the near future.  In order to compare results of
   different traceroute measurements, specifications both of the
   operating system (name and version) and of the traceroute tool
   version used are added to the metadata elements in order to help in
   comparing metrics.  Moreover, the traceroute has built-in
   configurable mechanisms like time-outs and can experience problems
   related to the crossing of firewalls; therefore some of the packets
   that traceroute sends out end up being time-out or filtered.  As a
   consequence, it might not be possible to trace the path to a node or
   there might not be a complete set of probes describing the RTT to
   reach it.

3.2.  Alternative traceroute Implementations

   As stated above, the widespred use of firewalls might prevent UDP or
   ICMP based traceroutes to completely trace the path to a destination,
   since traceroute probes might end up being filtered.  In some cases,
   such limitation might be overcome by sending instead TCP packets to
   specific ports that hosts located behind the firewall are listening
   for connections on.  TCP based implementations use TCP SYN or FYN
   probes and listen for TIME_EXCEEDED messages, TCP RESET and other
   messages from firewalls and gateways on the path.  On the other hand,
   some firewalls filter out TCP SYN packets to prevent denial of
   service attacks, therefore the actual advantage of using TCP instead
   of UDP traceroute depends mainly on firewall configurations, which
   are not known in adavance.  A detailed analysis of TCP based
   traceroutes is outside the scope of this draft, therefore in the
   sequel, we will restrict our focus to the most commonly implemented
   UDP based traceroute.


4.  Reports/results

   The following list reports the information fields provided by all
   traceroute implementations considered.  The order in which they are

Internet-Draft          Traceroute Storage Format           October 2006


   reported here is not relevant and it changes in different
   implementations.  For each hop the information reported is:
   o  the hop index;
   o  the host symbolical address, provided that at least one of the
      probes received a response, the symbolic address could be resolved
      at the correponding host and that the option to display only
      numerical addresses was not set;
   o  the host IP address, provided that at least one of the probes
      received a response;
   o  the RTT for each response to a probe.
   Depending on the traceroute implementation, additional information
   might be displayed in the output (for instance MPLS-related
   information).

   It might happen that some probes do not receive a response within the
   configured time-out (for instance if the probe is filtered out by a
   firewall).  In this case, an "*" is displayed in place of the RTT.
   Besides, for delays below 1 ms, some implementations reports 0 ms
   (f.i.  UNIX and LINUX) while WINDOWS tracert reports "< 1 ms".


5.  Information Model for Storing Traceroute Measurements

   This section describes the information model for the traceroute
   measurements data storing.  The information model is composed of
   information elements; for defining these information elements, a
   template is used.  Such template is specified in the list below:

   o  name - A unique and meaningful name for the information element.
      The preferred spelling for the name is to use mixed case if the
      name is compound, with an initial lower case letter, e.g.,
      "sourceIpAddress".
   o  description - The semantics of this information element.
   o  dataType - One of the types listed in Section 5.1 of this document
      or in an extension of the information model.  The type space for
      attributes is constrained to facilitate implementation.
   o  units - If the element is a measure of some kind, the units
      identify what the measure is.
   o  default value - The default value for the element (where
      applicable).

5.1.  Data Types

   This section describes the set of valid data types of the information
   model.

Internet-Draft          Traceroute Storage Format           October 2006


   o  String - The type "String" represents a finite length string of
      valid characters from the Unicode character encoding set.  Unicode
      allows for ASCII and many other international character sets to be
      used.  It is expected that strings will be encoded in UTF-8
      format, which is identical in encoding for USASCII characters, but
      also accomodates other Unicode multibyte characters.
   o  InetAddressType - The type "InetAddressType" represents a type of
      Internet address.  The allowed values are to be intended as
      imported from [RFC4001]; an additional allowed value is
      "asnumber".
   o  InetAddress - The type "InetAddress" denotes a generic Internet
      address.  The allowed values are to be intended as imported from
      [RFC4001]; an additional allowed value is the AS number to be
      indicated as the actual number plus the indication how the mapping
      from IP address to AS number was performed.
   o  TruthValue - The type "TruthValue" represents a boolean value.
      The allowed values are to be intended as imported from [RFC2579].
   o  Unsigned32 - The type "Unsigned32" represents a value in the range
      (0..4294967295).
   o  InterfaceIndexOrZero - The type "InterfaceIndexOrZero" is an
      extension of the InterfaceIndex convention.  The latter defines a
      greater than zero value used to identify an interface or interface
      sub-layer in the system.  This extension permits the additional
      value of zero.  Examples of the usage of zero might include
      situations where interface was unknown, or when none or all
      interfaces need to be referenced.  The allowed values are to be
      intended as imported from [RFC2863].
   o  ProbesType - The type "ProbesType" represents a way of indicating
      the protocol used for the traceroute probes.  Allowed values are
      UDP, TCP, ICMP.
   o  DateAndTime - The type "DateAndTime" represents a date-time
      specification.  The allowed values are to be intended as imported
      from [RFC2579] apart from the fact that in this document there is
      the need to use a milli-second resolution instead a deci-second
      one.
   o  OperationResponseStatus - The type "OperationResponseStatus" is
      used to report the result of an operation.  The allowed values are
      to be intended as imported from [RFC4560].

5.2.  Information Elements

   This section describes the elements of the traceroute measurement.
   The elements are grouped in two groups (Configuration and Results)
   according to their semantics.  In order to relate configuration and
   results elements by means of a common unique identifier, an
   additional element is defined belonging to both the two groups.

5.2.1.  Configuration Information Elements

   This section describes the elements of the traceroute measurement
   that are specific to traceroute configuration.

5.2.1.1.  traceRouteCtlTargetAddressType

   o  name - traceRouteCtlTargetAddressType
   o  description - Specifies the type of host address used in the
      traceroute command.
   o  dataType - InetAddressType
   o  units - N/A
   o  default value - N/A

5.2.1.2.  traceRouteCtlTargetAddress

   o  name - traceRouteCtlTargetAddress
   o  description - Specifies the host address used in the traceroute
      command.  The host address type can be determined by the examining
      the value of the corresponding traceRouteCtlTargetAddressType.

   o  default value - N/A

5.2.1.3.  traceRouteCtlByPassRouteTable

   o  name - traceRouteCtlByPassRouteTable
   o  description - Specifies if the optional bypassing of the route
      table was enabled or not.  If enabled, the traceroute will bypass
      the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on an
      attached network.  If the host is not on a directly-attached
      network, an error is returned.  This option can be used to perform
      the traceroute operation to a local host through an interface that
      has no route defined.
   o  dataType - TruthValue
   o  units - N/A
   o  default value - false

5.2.1.4.  traceRouteCtlProbeDataSize

   o  name - traceRouteCtlProbeDataSize
   o  description - Specifies the size of the data portion of a
      traceroute operation in octets.  If the RECOMMENDED traceroute
      method (UDP datagrams as probes) is used, then the value contained
      in this object is exact.  If another traceroute method is used for
      which the specified size is not appropriate, then the
      implementation should have used whatever size (appropriate to the
      method) is closest to the specified size.  The maximum value for

      this object was computed by substracting the smallest possible IP
      header size of 20 octets (IPv4 header with no options) and the UDP
      header size of 8 octets from the maximum IP packet size.  An IP
      packet has a maximum size of 65535 octets (excluding IPv6
      Jumbograms).
   o  dataType - Unsigned32
   o  units - octects
   o  default value - 0

5.2.1.5.  traceRouteCtlTimeOut

      traceroute operation.
   o  dataType - Unsigned32
   o  units - seconds
   o  default value - 3

5.2.1.6.  traceRouteCtlProbesPerHop

   o  name - traceRouteCtlProbesPerHop
   o  description - Specifies the number of times to reissue a
      traceroute request with the same time-to-live (TTL) value.
   o  dataType - Unsigned32
   o  units - probes
   o  default value - 3

5.2.1.7.  traceRouteCtlPort

   o  name - traceRouteCtlPort
   o  description - Specifies the base UDP port used by the traceroute
      operation.  Need to specify a port that is not in use at the
      destination (target) host.  The default value for this object is
      the IANA assigned port, 33434, for the traceroute function.
   o  dataType - Unsigned32
   o  units - UDP Port
   o  default value - 33434

5.2.1.8.  traceRouteCtlMaxTtl

   o  name - traceRouteCtlMaxTtl
   o  description - Specifies the maximum TTL value for the traceroute
      operation.
   o  dataType - Unsigned32
   o  units - time-to-live value
   o  default value - 30

5.2.1.9.  traceRouteCtlDSField

   o  name - traceRouteCtlDSField
   o  description - Specifies the value that was stored in the
      Differentiated Services (DS) field in the IP packet used to
      encapsulate the traceroute probe.  The DS Field is defined as the
      Type of Service (TOS) octet in a IPv4 header or as the Traffic
      Class octet in a IPv6 header.  The value of this object must be a
      decimal integer in the range from 0 to 255.  This option can be
      used to determine what effect an explicit DS field setting has on
      a traceroute response.  Not all values are legal or meaningful.
      Useful TOS octet values are probably '16' (low delay) and '8'
      (high throughput).  Further references can be found in [RFC2474]
      for the definition of the Differentiated Services (DS) field and
      to [RFC1812] Section 5.3.2 for Type of Service (TOS).
   o  dataType - Unsigned32
   o  units - N/A
   o  default value - 0

5.2.1.10.  traceRouteCtlSourceAddressType

   o  name - traceRouteCtlSourceAddressType
   o  description - Specifies the type of the source address,
      traceRouteCtlSourceAddress, used when performing the traceroute
      operation.
   o  dataType - InetAddressType
   o  units - N/A
   o  default value - N/A

5.2.1.11.  traceRouteCtlSourceAddress

   o  name - traceRouteCtlSourceAddress
   o  description - Specifies the IP address (which has to be given as
      an IP number, not a hostname) as the source address used in
      outgoing probe packets.  On hosts with more than one IP address,
      this option can be used to force the source address to be
      something other than the primary IP address of the interface the
      probe packet is sent on.  A zero length octet string value for
      this object means that source address specification was disabled.
      The address type (InetAddressType) that relates to this object is
      specified by the corresponding value of
      traceRouteCtlSourceAddressType.
   o  dataType - InetAddress
   o  units - N/A
   o  default value - N/A

5.2.1.12.  traceRouteCtlIfIndex

   o  name - traceRouteCtlIfIndex
   o  description - Specifies the inferface index used in the traceroute
      operation for sending the traceroute probes.  A value of zero for
      this object implies that the interface was unknown.
   o  dataType - InterfaceIndexOrZero
   o  units - N/A
   o  default value - 0

5.2.1.13.  traceRouteCtlMiscOptions

   o  name - traceRouteCtlMiscOptions
   o  description - Specifies implementation dependent options.
   o  dataType - String
   o  units - N/A
   o  default value - N/A

5.2.1.14.  traceRouteCtlMaxFailures

   o  name - traceRouteCtlMaxFailures
   o  description - Specifies the maximum number of consecutive timeouts
      allowed before terminating a traceroute operation.  A value of
      either 255 (maximum hop count/possible TTL value) or a 0 indicates
      that the function of terminating a remote traceroute operation
      when a specific number of consecutive timeouts are detected was
      disabled.  This element is included to give full compatibility
      with [RFC4560].  No known implementation of traceroute currently
      supports it.
   o  dataType - Unsigned32
   o  units - timeouts
   o  default value - 5

5.2.1.15.  traceRouteCtlDontFragment

   o  name - traceRouteCtlDontFragment
   o  description - Specifies if the don't fragment flag (DF) in the IP
      header for a probe was enabled or not.  Setting the DF flag can be
      used for performing a manual PATH MTU test.

6.  Data Model for Storing Traceroute Measurements

   For storing and transmitting information according to the information
   model defined in the previous section, a data model is required that
   specifies how to encode the elements of the information model.

   There are several design choices for a data model.  It can use a
   binary or textual representation and it can be defined from scratch
   or use already existing frameworks and data models.  In general, the
   use of already existing frameworks and models should be preferred.

   Binary and textual representation both have advantages and
   disadvantages.  Textual representions are (with some limitations)
   human readable while a binary representation consumes less resources
   for storing, transmitting and parsing data.

   An already existing and closely related data model is the DISMAN-
   TRACEROUTE-MIB module [RFC4560], that specifies a BER encoding
   [RFC3417] used by the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
   [RFC3410] for transmitting traceroute information.  This data model
   is well suited and supported within network management systems, but
   as a general format for storing and transmitting traceroute results
   it is not easily applicable.

   Another binary representation would be an extension of traffic flow
   information encodings as specified for the IPFIX protocol
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol], [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info].  The IPFIX protocol
   is extensible.  However, the architecture behind this protocol



Niccolini, et al.        Expires April 25, 2007                [Page 19]

Internet-Draft          Traceroute Storage Format           October 2006


   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-architecture] is targeted at exporting passively
   measured flow information.  Therefore, some obstacles are expected
   when trying to use it for transmitting traceroute measurement
   results.

   For textual representations, using the eXtensible Markup Language
   (XML) [XML] is an obvious choice.  XML supports clean structuring of
   data and syntax checking of records.  With some limitations it is
   human readable.  It is supported well by a huge pool of tools and
   standards for generating, transmitting, parsing and converting it to
   other data formats.  Its disadvantages is the resource comsumption
   for processing, storing, and transmitting information.  Since the
   expected data volumes of traceroute data in network operation and
   maintenance is not expected to be extremly high, the inefficient
   usage of resources is not a significant disadvantage.  Therefore, XML
   was chosen as basis for the traceroute information model that is
   specified in this section.

   Section 7 contains the XML schema to be used as a template for
   storing and/or exchanging traceroute measurements.  The schema was
   designed in order to use an extensible approach based on templates
   (pretty similar to how IPFIX protocol is designed) where the
   traceroute configuration elements (both the requested parameters,
   traceRouteRequest, and the actual parameters used,
   traceRouteMeasurementMetadata) are metadata to be referenced by
   results information elements (data) by means of the
   traceRouteTestName element (used as unique identifier).  Currently
   Global Grid Forum (GGF) is also using this approach and cross-
   requirements have been analyzed as well as standardization
   opportunities of a joint work.

8.  Differences to DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB

   For performing remote traceroute operations at managed node, the IETF
   has standardized the DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB module in RFC 4560
   [RFC4560].  This module allows:

   o  retrieving capability information of the traceroute implementation
      at the managed node,
   o  configuring traceroute operations to be prformed,
   o  retrieving information about ongoing and completed traceroute
      measurements,
   o  retrieving traceroute measurement statistics.

   The traceroute storage format described in this document has
   significant overlaps with this MIB module.  Particularly, the models
   for the traceroute measurement configuration and for the result from
   completed measurements are almost identical.  But for other pats of
   the DISMAN-TRACEROUTE MIB module there is no need to model them in a
   traceroute storage format.  Particularly, the capability information,
   information about ongoing measurements and measurement statistics are
   not covered by the traceroute storage model.

   Concerning traceroute measurements and results, there are structural
   differences between the two models caused by the different choices
   for the encoding of the specification.  For DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB,
   the Structure of Management Information (SMIv2, STD 58, RFC 2578
   [RFC2578]) was used, while for the traceroute storage format is
   encoded using XML.

   This difference in structure implies that the DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB
   module contains SMI-specific information element (managed objects)
   that concern tables of managed objects (specification, entry creation



Niccolini, et al.        Expires April 25, 2007                [Page 38]

   and delection, status retrieval) that are not required for the XML-
   encoded traceroute storage format.

   But for most of the remaining information elements that concern
   configuration of traceroute measurements and results of completed
   measurements, the semantics is identical between the DISMAN-
   TRACEROUTE-MIB module and the traceroute storage format.  There are
   very few exceptions to this which are listed below.  Also naming of
   information elements is identical between both models with a few
   exceptions.  For the traceroute storage model, a few information
   elements have been added, some because of the different structure and
   some to provide additional information on completed measurements.

8.1.  Naming

   Basically, names in both models are chosen using the same naming
   conventions.

   For the traceroute measurement configuration information all names,
   such as traceRouteCtlProbesPerHop, are identical in both models,
   except for traceRouteCtlDataSize which was renamed to
   traceRouteCtlProbeDataSize for clarification in the traceroute
   storage model.

   Results of measurements in the DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB modules are
   distributed over two tables, the traceRouteResultsTable containing
   mainly information about ongoing measurements and the
   traceRouteProbeHistoryTable containing only information about
   completed measurements.  According to the SMIv2 naming conventions
   names of information elements in these tables have different prefixes
   (traceRouteResults and traceRouteProbeHistory). since the traceroute
   storage format only reports on completed measurements, this
   separation is not needed anymore and the prefix "traceRouteResults"
   is used for all related information elelments.

   Beyond that, there are only a few changes in element names.  The
   renaming actions include:

   o  traceRouteProbeHistoryProbeIndex to
      traceRouteResultsProbeIndexPerHop,
   o  traceRouteProbeHistoryResponse to
      traceRouteResultsProbeRoundTripTime,
   o  traceRouteProbeHistoryTime to traceRouteResultsEndDateAndTime,
   o  traceRouteProbeHistoryLastRC to traceRouteResultsHopRawOutputData.

Internet-Draft          Traceroute Storage Format           October 2006


8.2.  Semantics

   The semantics was changed for two information elements only.

   For traceRouteProbeHistoryResponse in the DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB, a
   value of 0 indicated, that it was not possible to transmit a probe.
   For the traceroute strorage format, a value of 0 for element
   traceRouteResultsProbeRoundTripTime indicates that the measured time
   was less than one millisecond, while for the case that it was not
   possible to transmit a probe a string is used that indicates the
   problem.

   For traceRouteCtlIfIndex in the DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB, a value of 0
   indicated, that it the option to set the index is not available.
   This was translated to the traceroute strorage format, such that a
   value of 0 for this element indicates that the used interface is
   unknown.

   The element traceRouteProbeHistoryLastRC in the DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB
   was replaced by element traceRouteResultsHopRawOutputData.  While
   traceRouteProbeHistoryLastRC just reports a reply code,
   traceRouteResultsHopRawOutputData reports the full raw output data
   produced by the traceroute instance that was used.

8.3.  Additional Information Elements

   Only a few information elements have been added to the model of the
   DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB module.

   o  For providing geographical information about hops in the
      traceroute path, traceRouteResultsProbeHopGeoLocation was added.
   o  For providing the top MPLS label stack entry of a probe in the
      traceroute path traceRouteResultsProbeMPLSTopLabel was added.
   o  For providing additional timestamp beyond
      traceRouteResultsEndDateAndTime, traceRouteResultsStartDateAndTime
      and traceRouteResultsProbeTime were added.


9.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations in this section discuss are grouped into
   considerartions related to conducting traceroute measurements and
   considerations related to storing and transmitting results of
   measurements.

   This memo does not specify an implementation of a traceroute
   measurements.  Neither does it specify a certain procedure for
   storing traceroute measurement results.  Still it is considered



Niccolini, et al.        Expires April 25, 2007                [Page 40]

Internet-Draft          Traceroute Storage Format           October 2006


   desirable to discuss related security issues below.

9.1.  Conducting Traceroute Measurements

   Conducting Internet measurements can raise both security and privacy
   concerns.  Traceroute measurements, in which traffic is injected into
   the network, can be abused for denial-of-service attacks disguised as
   legitimate measurement activity.

   Measurement parameters MUST be carefully selected so that the
   measurements inject trivial amounts of additional traffic into the
   networks they measure.  If they inject "too much" traffic, they can
   skew the results of the measurement, and in extreme cases cause
   congestion and denial of service.

   The measurements themselves could be harmed by routers giving
   measurement traffic a different priority than "normal" traffic, or by
   an attacker injecting artificial measurement traffic.  If routers can
   recognize measurement traffic and treat it separately, the
   measurements will not reflect actual user traffic.  If an attacker
   injects artificial traffic that is accepted as legitimate, the loss
   rate will be artificially lowered.  Therefore, the measurement
   methodologies SHOULD include appropriate techniques to reduce the
   probability measurement traffic can be distinguished from "normal"
   traffic.

   Authentication techniques, such as digital signatures, may be used
   where appropriate to guard against injected traffic attacks.

9.2.  Securing Traceroute Measurement Results

   Traceroute results are not considered highly sensible.  Still, they
   may contain sensible information on network paths, routing states,
   use IP addresses, and roundtrip times, that the operator a networks
   may want to detect for business or security reasons.

   It is thus important to control access to Information acquired by
   conducting traceroute measurement, particularly when transmitting it
   over a networks but also when storing it.  It is RECOMMENDED that
   transmission of traceroute measurement results over a network uses
   appropriate protection mechanisms for preserving privacy, integrity
   and authenticity.  It is further RECOMMENDED that secure
   authentication and authorization are used for protecting stored
   traceroute results.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document uses URNs to describe an XML namespace and an XML
   schema for traceroute measurements conforming to a registry mechanism
   described in [RFC3688].  Two URI assignments are requested.
   1.  Registration request for the IPPM traceroute measurements
       namespace
       *  URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:traceroute-1.0
       *  Registrant Contact: TBD.
       *  XML: None.  Namespace URIs do not represent an XML
   2.  Registration request for the IPPM traceroute measurements schema
       *  URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:traceroute-1.0
       *  Registrant Contact: TBD.
       *  XML: See the section Section 7 of this document.
