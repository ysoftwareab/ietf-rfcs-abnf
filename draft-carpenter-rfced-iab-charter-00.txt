1.  Introduction

   In the RFC Editor model defined by [I-D.saintandre-rfced-model], the
   RFC Series is now governed by its own mechanisms.  This requires a
   modification to the Internet Architecture Board charter [RFC2850].

   Note that RFC 2850 states that the RFC Editor appoints a liaison
   member to the IAB.  This does not change.

2.  Changed Text

   In Section 2 of RFC 2850, entitled "The Role of the IAB", under the
   sub-heading "(b) RFC Series and IANA", the following sentence:

   The IAB must approve the appointment of an organization to act as RFC
   Editor and the general policy followed by the RFC Editor.

   is replaced by:

   The RFC Editor model is defined by [I-D.saintandre-rfced-model].

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document should not affect the security of the Internet.

5.  Acknowledgements

   Useful comments were received from [TBD] ...
