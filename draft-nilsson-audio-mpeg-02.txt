Abstract

   The audio layers of the MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 standards are in frequent
   use on the internet, but there is no uniform MIME type for these
   files. The intention of this draft is to define the media type
   audio/mpeg to refer to this kind of contents.


1.  MPEG audio

   The audio compression defined as layer I, layer II and layer III in
   the MPEG-1 [MPEG-1] and MPEG-2 [MPEG-2] standards is a popular method
   of compressing audio with a low quality loss. The compressed audio is
   split into several small data frames, each containing a frame header
   and compressed audio data.

   The mime type audio/mpeg defines a elementary byte stream containing
   MPEG frames according to [MPEG-1] and [MPEG-2], possibly interspersed
   with non MPEG data. Non MPEG data is data without MPEG
   synchronisation or in other ways not possible to decompress without
   error.

   Typically MPEG audio meta data is concatenated with the MPEG stream,
   e.g. the meta data format ID3 puts a 128 byte data block in the end
   of the stream while ID3v2 [ID3V2] prepends a data block of variable
   size to the stream.
   
   NOTE: MPEG audio was not designed as a file format but as a format
   for transmitting audio streams. As such, it does not have any
   well defined way of including meta data along with audio information.
   Some products embed meta data using zero amplitude frames or
   disguised as transmission errors. Others embed the MPEG data in WAV
   format.


2.  Registration Information

   To: ietf-types@iana.org
   Subject: Registration of MIME media type audio/mpeg

   MIME media type name: audio

   MIME subtype name: mpeg

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: none

   Encoding considerations:

       For use over internet it is assumed that lower layers take care
       of transmission errors, so audio/mpeg data MAY include MPEG
       frames generated without the optional cyclic redundancy checks
       (CRC) for improved audio quality.

       The MPEG audio data is binary data, and must be encoded for
       non-binary transport; the Base64 encoding is suitable for Email.
       Note that the MPEG audio data does not compress easily using
       lossless compression.

   Security considerations:

       Data concatenated with the MPEG stream might contain executable
       code. This executable code can only be executed by a program that
       looks for it and is not executed by an MPEG audio decoder when it
       attempts to play the file. It's simply ignored.

   Interoperability considerations:

       MPEG audio has proven to be widely interoperable across computer
       platforms.

   Published specification: see [MPEG-1] and [MPEG-2]

   Applications which use this media type:

       MPEG audio is device-, platform- and vendor-neutral and is
       supported by a wide range of encoders and decoders (players).

   Additional information:

       Magic number(s): none
       File extension(s): .mp1, .mp2, .mp3
       Macintosh File Type Code(s): MPEG
       Object Identifier(s) or OID(s): none
