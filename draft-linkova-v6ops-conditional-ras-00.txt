   Using Conditional Router Advertisements for Enterprise Multihoming
                 draft-linkova-v6ops-conditional-ras-00

Abstract

   This document discusses most common scenarios of connecting an
   enterprise network to multiple ISPs using provider aggregatable
   address space (PA).  The problem of enterprise multihoming without
   address translation of any form has not been solved yet as it
   requires both the network to select the correct egress ISP based on
   the packet source address and hosts to select the correct source
   address based on the desired egress ISP for that traffic.
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-enterprise-pa-multihoming] proposes a solution to
   this problem by introducing a new routing functionality (Source
   Address Dependent Routing) to solve the uplink selection issue and
   using Router Advertisements to influence the host source address
   selection.  While the above-mentioned document focus is on solving
   the general problem and to cover various complex use cases, this
   document describes how the solution proposed in
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-enterprise-pa-multihoming] can be adopted for limited
   number of common use cases.  In particular the focus is on scenarios
   when a enterprise network has two Internet uplinks used either in
   primary/backup mode or simultaniously and hosts in that network might
   not yet properly support multihoming as described in [RFC8028].

1.  Introduction

   Multihoming is an obvious requirement for many enterprise network to
   ensure the desired level of network reliability.  However using more
   than one ISP introduces the problem of assigning IP addresses to
   hosts.  In IPv4 world there was no choice but using [RFC1918] address
   space and NAT at the network edge (using Provider Independent or PI

   address space is not always an option as it requires running BGP
   between the enterprise network and the ISPs).  As IPv6 host can, by
   design, have multiple addresses of the global scope, multihoming
   using provider address looks even easier for IPv6: each ISP assigns
   an IPv6 block (usually /48) and hosts in the enterprise network have
   addresses assigned from each ISP block.  However using IPv6 PA blocks
   in multihoming scenario introduces some challenges, including but not
   limited to:

   o  Selecting the correct uplink based on the packet source address

   o  signaling to hosts that some source addresses should or should not
      be used (e.g. an uplink to the ISP went down or became available
      again)

   The document [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-enterprise-pa-multihoming] discusses
   those and other related challenges in details in relation to general
   multihoming scenario for enterprise networks.  Unfortunately the
   proposed solution heavily relies on the rule 5.5 of the default
   address selection algorithm ([RFC6724]) which has not been widely
   implemented.  Therefore network administrators in enterprise networks
   could not yet assume that all devices in their network support the
   rule 5.5, especially in quite common BYOD ("Bring Your Own Device")
   scenario.  However while it does not seem feasible to solve all
   possible multihoming scenarios without reliying on rule 5.5, it is
   possible to provide IPv6 multihoming using PA address space for most
   common use cases.  This document discusses how the general solution
   described in [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-enterprise-pa-multihoming] can be
   applied to those two specific cases.

2.  Common Enterprise Multihoming Scenarios

2.1.  Two ISP Uplinks, Primary and Backup

   This scenario has the following key characteristics:`

   o  The enterprise network is using uplinks to two (or more) ISPs for
      Internet access;

   o  Each ISP assigns an IPv6 PA address space for the network.

   o  Uplink(s) to one ISP is a primary (preferred) one.  All other
      uplinks are backup and are not expected to be used while the
      primary one is operational.

   o  If the primary uplink is operational, all Internet traffic should
      flow via that uplink.

   o  When the primary uplink fails the Internet traffic needs to flow
      via the backup uplinks.

   o  Recovery of the primary uplink needs to trigger the traffic
      switchover from the backup uplinks back to primary one.

2.2.  Two ISP Uplinks, Used for Load Balancing

   This scenario has the following key characteristics:`

   o  The enterprise network is using uplinks to two (or more) ISPs for
      Internet access;

   o  Each ISP assigns an IPv6 PA address space.

   o  All uplink may be used simultaneously, traffic being randomly
      balanced between them.

3.  Conditional Router Advertisements

3.1.  Solution Overview

3.1.1.  Uplink Selection

   As discussed in [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-enterprise-pa-multihoming] one of two
   main problems to be solved in the enterprise multihoming scenario is
   the problem of the next-hop (uplink) selection based on the packet
   source address.  For example if the enterprise network has two
   uplinks, to ISP_A and ISP_B and hosts have addresses from subnet_A
   and subnet_B (belonging to ISP_A and ISP_B respectively) then packets
   sourced from subnet_A must be sent to ISP_A uplink while packets
   sourced from subnet_B must be sent to ISP_B uplink.

   While some work is being done in the Source Address Dependent Routing
   (SADR) area, the simplest way to implement the desired functionality
   currently is to apply a policy which select a next-hop or an egress
   interface based on the packet source.  Most of SMB/Enterprise grade
   routers have such functionality available currently.

3.1.2.  Source Address Selection and Conditional RAs

   Another problem to be solved in the multihoming scenario is the
   source address selection on hosts.  In the normal situation (all
   uplinks are up/operational) hosts have multiple global unique
   addresses and can rely on the default address selection algorithm
   ([RFC6724]) to pick up a source address, while the network is
   responsible for choosing the correct uplink based on the source
   address selected by a host as described in Section 3.1.2.  However

Internet-Draft               Conditional RAs                   June 2017


   some network topology changes (changing uplink status) might affect
   the global reachability for packets sourced from the particular
   prefixes and therefore such changes have to be signaled back to the
   hosts.  For example:

   o  An uplink to an ISP_A went down so hosts should not use addresses
      from ISP_A prefix;

   o  A primary uplink to ISP_A which was not operational has come back
      up so hosts should start using the source addresses from ISP_A
      prefix;

   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-enterprise-pa-multihoming] provides detailed
   explanation on why SLAAC and router advertisements are the most
   suitable mechanism for signaling network topology changes to hosts
   and influencing the source address selection.  Sending a router
   advertisement to change the preferred lifetime for a given prefix
   provides the following functionality:

   o  deprecating addresses (by sending an RA with the
      preferred_lifetime set to 0 in the corresponding POI) to indicate
      to hosts that that addresses from that prefix should not be used;

   o  making previously unused (deprecated) prefix usable again (by
      sending an RA containing a POI with non-zero preferred lifetime)
      to indicate to hosts that addresses from that prefix can be used
      again;

   To provide the desired functionality, first-hop routers are required
   to

   o  send RA triggered by defined event policies in response to uplink
      status change event.

   o  while sending periodic or solicted RAs, set the value in the given
      RA field (e.g.  PIO preferred lifetime) based on the uplink
      status.

   The exact definition of the 'uplink status' depends on the network
   topology and may include conditions like:

   o  uplink interface status change

   o  presence of a particular route in the routing table

   o  presence of a particular route with the particular attribute
      (next-hop, tag etc) in the routing table

Internet-Draft               Conditional RAs                   June 2017


   o  protocol adjacency change

   etc.

   In some scenarios, when two routers providing first-hop redundancy
   via VRRP, the master-backup status can be considered as a conditions
   for sending RA and changing the preferred lifetime value.  See
   Section 3.2.2 for more details.

   If hosts are provided with ISP DNS servers IPv6 addresses via RDNSS
   [RFC8106] it might be desirable for the conditional RAs to update
   Lifetime field of the RDNSS option as well.

3.2.  Example Scenarios

   This section illustrates how the conditional RAs solution can be
   applied to most common enterprise multihoming scenarios.

3.2.1.  Single Router, Primary/Backup Uplinks


                                                                        --------

                       |      |-------------------+    ISP_B    +---+:            :
                       +------+                    ',         ,'     :            :
                                                     '-------'        ',        ,'
                                                                        --------


              Figure 1: Single Router, Primary/Backup Uplinks

   Let's look at the simple network topology when a single router acts
   as a border router to terminate two ISP uplinks and as a first-hop
   router for hosts.  Each ISP assigns /48 to the network and the ISP_A
   uplink is a primary one, to be used for all Internet traffic, while
   the ISP_B uplink is a backup, to be used only when the primary uplink
   is not operational.

   To ensure that packets with ISP_A and ISP_B source addresses are only
   routed to ISP_A and ISP_B uplinks respectively, network administrator
   needs to configure a policy on R1:

Internet-Draft               Conditional RAs                   June 2017


if {
     packet_destination_address is not in 2001:db8:1::/48 or 2001:db8:2::/48
     packet_source_address is in 2001:db8:1::/48
} then {
       next-hop is ISP_A_uplink
}
if {
     packet_destination_address is not in 2001:db8:1::/48 or 2001:db8:2::/48
     packet_source_address is in 2001:db8:1::/48
}
then {
       next-hop is ISP_B_uplink
}

   Under normal circumstances it's desirable that all traffic is sent
   via ISP_A uplink, therefore hosts (the host H1 in the example
   topology figure) should be using source addresses from
   2001:db8:1:1:/64.  When/if ISP_A uplink fails, hosts should stop
   using 2001:db8:1:1:/64 prefix and start using 2001:db8:1:2:/64 until
   the ISP_A uplink comes back up.  To achieve the desired behavior the
   router advertisement configuration on the R1 device for the interface
   facing H1 needs to have the following policy:

   prefix 2001:db8:1:1::/64 {
     if ISP_A_uplink is up
       then preferred_lifetime = 604800
     else preferred_lifetime = 0
    }

   prefix 2001:db8:2:1::/64 {
     if ISP_A_Uplink is up
       then preferred_lifetime = 0
     else preferred_lifetime = 604800
   }

   The similar policy needs to be applied to RDNSS Lifetime filed if
   ISP_A and ISP_B DNS servers are used.

3.2.2.  Two Routers, Primary/Backup Uplinks

   Let's look at a bit more complex scenario when two border routers are
   terminating two ISP uplinks (one each), acting as redundant first-hop
   routers for hosts.  The topology is shown on the Fig.2

                                                     '-------'        ',        ,'
                                                                        --------


               Figure 2: Two Routers, Primary/Backup Uplinks

   In this scenario R1 sends RAs with PIO for 2001:db8:1:1::/64 (ISP_A
   address space) and R2 sends RAs with PIO for 2001:db8:2:1::/64 (ISP_B
   address space).  Each router needs to have a forwarding policy
   configured for packets received on hosts-facing interface:

if {
     packet_destination_address is not in 2001:db8:1::/48 or 2001:db8:2::/48
     packet_source_address is in 2001:db8:1::/48
} then {
    next-hop is ISP_A_uplink
}
if {
     packet_destination_address is not in 2001:db8:1::/48 or 2001:db8:2::/48
     packet_source_address is in 2001:db8:1::/48
} then {
    next-hop is ISP_B_uplink
}

   In this case there is more than one way ensure that hosts are
   selecting the correct source address based on the uplink status.  If
   VRRP is used to provide first-hop redundancy and the master router is
   one with the active uplink, then the simplest way to use VRRP
   mastership as a condition for router advertisement.  So, if ISP_A is
   the primary uplink, the routers R1 and R2 need to be configured in
   the following way:

   R1 is VRRP master by default (when ISP_A uplink is up).  If ISP_A
   uplink is down then R1 becomes a backup.  Router advertisement on R1
   interface facing H1 needs to have the following policy applied:

   prefix 2001:db8:1:1::/64 {
     if vrrp_master then preferred_lifetime = 604800
       else preferred_lifetime = 0
   }

   R2 is VRRP backup by default.  Router advertsement on R2 interface
   facing H1 needs to have the following policy applied:

   prefix 2001:db8:2:1::/64 {
     if vrrp_master then preferred_lifetime = 604800
       else preferred_lifetime = 0
   }

   If VRRP is not used or interface status tracking is not used for
   mastership switchover, then each router needs to be able to detect
   somehow the uplink failure/recovery on the neighboring router so RAs
   with updated preferred lifetime value are triggered.  Depending on
   the network setup various triggers like a route to uplink interface
   subnet or a defaul route received from the uplink can be used.  The
   obvious drawback of using the routing table to trigger the
   conditional RAs is that some additional configuration would be
   required.  For example if a route to the prefix assigned to the ISP
   uplink is used as a trgger then the conditional RA policy would have
   the following logic:

   R1:

   prefix 2001:db8:1:1::/64 {
     if ISP_A_uplink is up then preferred_lifetime = 604800
     else preferred_lifetime = 0
     }

   R2:

   prefix 2001:db8:2:1::/64 {
     if ISP_A_uplink_route is present then preferred_lifetime = 0
       else preferred_lifetime = 604800
    }

3.2.3.  Single Router, Load Balancing Between Uplinks

   Let's look at the example topology shown on Figure 1 but with both
   uplinks used simultaneously.  In that case R1 would send RAs
   containing PIOs for both prefixes, 2001:db8:1:1::/64 and
   2001:db8:2:1::/64, changing the preferred lifetime based on
   particular uplink availability.  If the interface status is used as a
   uplink availability indicator The policy logic would look like:

Internet-Draft               Conditional RAs                   June 2017


   prefix 2001:db8:1:1::/64 {
     if ISP_A_uplink is up then preferred_lifetime  = 604800
        else preferred_lifetime = 0
   }
   prefix 2001:db8:2:1::/64 {
     if ISP_B_uplink is up then preferred_lifetime  = 604800
        else preferred_lifetime = 0
   }

   R1 needs a forwarding policy to be applied to forward packets to the
   correct uplink based on the source address as described in
   Section 3.2.1.

3.2.4.  Two Router, Load Balancing Between Uplinks

   In this scenario the example topology is similar to one shown on
   Figure 2 but both uplinks can be used at the same time.  It means
   that both R1 and R2 have to have the corresponding forwarding policy
   to forward packets based on their source addresses.

   Each router would send RAs with POI for the corresponding prefix.
   setting preferred_lifetime to non-zero value when the ISP uplink is
   up and deprecating the prefix by setting the preferred lifetime to 0
   in case of the uplink failure.  The uplink recovery would trigger
   another RA with non-zero preferred lifetime to make the addresses
   from the prefix preferred again.  The example RA policy on R1 and R2
   would look like:

   R1:

   prefix 2001:db8:1:1::/64 {
     if ISP_A_uplink is up then preferred_lifetime  = 604800
        else preferred_lifetime = 0
   }

   R2:

   prefix 2001:db8:2:1::/64 {
     if ISP_B_uplink is up then preferred_lifetime  = 604800
        else preferred_lifetime = 0
   }

3.2.5.  Topologies with Dedicated Border Routers

   For simplicity reasons all topologie sbelow show the ISP uplinks
   terminated on the first-hop routers.  Obviously the proposed approach
   can be used in more complex topologies when dedicated devices are
   used for terminating ISP uplinks.  In that case VRRP mastership or

   inteface status can not be used as a triiger for conditional RAs and
   route presence should be used instead as describe above.
