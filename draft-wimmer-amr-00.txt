1.  Abstract

   This document defines MIME-name audio/AMR, encoding format 
   definitions and its parameters for GSM Adaptive Multi Rate (AMR) 
   speech codec for storage purpose.

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [2].

3. Introduction

   GSM Adaptive Multi Rate (AMR) codec [3] is a speech codec developed 
   by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). The 
   AMR codec is the mandatory speech codec for GSM and for third 
   generation systems by 3GPP. Although the AMR-codec was primarily 
   designed for wireless systems it gives excellent speech quality also
   for wirelined systems.

Internet Draft   MIME Type Registration of AMR Speech Codec   March 2000


   The AMR allows eight different speech coding modes. The bit-rates 
   range from 4.75 to 12.2 kbit/s, see Table 1. The sampling rate is 
   8000 Hz and processing is performed on 20 ms frames.

   Coding mode     bit-rate        note
   --------------------------------------------
    0              4.75 kbit/s
    1              5.15 kbit/s
    2              5.9  kbit/s
    3              6.7  kbit/s     PDC-EFR
    4              7.4  kbit/s     IS-641 [5]
    5              7.95 kbit/s
    6             10.2  kbit/s
    7             12.2  kbit/s     GSM EFR [6]
   Table 1: AMR speech coding modes

   As noted in Table 1 several rates are equivalent to other standards.
   Standard-compliant implementations [3] must support all eight coding
   modes. In addition to this, mode change may occur at any time.
   Furthermore Discontinuous Transmission / comfort noise (DTX/CN)
   functionality [7] may be used. Besides [7] for the particular coding
   modes 3, 4 and 7 specific DTX/CN schemes are defined, see [5][6][8].

   For storing AMR frames e.g. as a file or attachment, the AMR frames
   must be formatted according to [9]. Because no exchange of particular
   coding parameters, e.g. specific DTX/CN mode, can be signaled before
   downloading or receiving the AMR file or attachment, therefore the
   receiving entity (AMR decoder) must be able to decode all eight
   coding modes as well as the AMR DTX/CN [7]. All other DTX/CNs are not
   mandatory.

4.  MIME Registration

   MIME-name for the AMR codec is allocated from IETF tree since AMR is
   expected to be the widely used speech codec in wireless and wirelined
   Internet messaging and email applications. This MIME type shall be 
   used for stored AMR data only, e.g. attachment in an email message.
   It may be also used by the 3G Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) [8].

   Media Type name:       audio

   Media subtype name:    AMR

   Required parameters:   none

   Optional parameters:   none

   Encoding considerations: Each audio frame must be formatted in octet
   format according to [9]. The audio frames must be organized in
   sequential order. This implies that the first octet after frame n 
   must be the first octet of frame (n+1). Each receiving entity that

   accepts this MIME type must be able to decode all eight AMR coding
   modes [3] and the AMR DTX/CN [7].


   Security considerations: none

   Interoperability considerations: none

   Public specification: please refer to chapter 5 "references".

   Additional information:
     Magic number: none
     File extensions: amr, AMR
     Macintosh file type code: none
     Object identifier or OID: none

   Intended usage:  COMMON. It is expected that many Internet 
                    applications (as well as mobile applications) will
                    use this type.
