Abstract

   Several application level compression/multiplexing solutions have
   been proposed in the IETF Audio/Video Transport (AVT) Working Group
   [1][2][9] to improve the transport efficiency of packet-voice traffic
   over IP-based networks. These approaches generally assume voice
   packets are RTP/UDP/IP encapsulated by the communicating end-points
   (e.g., IP phones, mobile terminal, media gateways, etc.).  In some
   transport scenarios, using RTP/UDP encapsulation for voice packet is
   unnecessary as only the data transfer services provided by the IP
   layer are required, not the media control functions.

   This document describes a lightweight IP encapsulation scheme to
   multiplex low bit rate audio (or multimedia) packets into a single
   UDP/IP or IP session. The decision to multiplexing audio packets at
   the UDP or IP layer is left as an implementation choice to balance

1.  Introduction

   As the Internet evolves into a ubiquitous communication infrastruc-
   ture, IP based technologies have also become more sophisticated.  As
   a consequence of the maturing of the IP technology, it is now evident
   that the previously separate data and voice networks are converging
   to provide integrated communications services, including data, voice
   and video.  While data packets can often be quite large, voice pack-
   ets are in general rather small. Codecs in IP phones or IP telephony
   gateways compress the incoming speech samples and generate speech
   frames with sizes ranging from 5 to 20 bytes per speech sample. For
   example, G723.1 generates a 20-byte speech frame at 30 ms intervals
   [3]. Many codecs used in cellular environments generate speech frames
   of size less than 10 bytes per speech sample.

   Such small speech frame sizes are subject to a large transport over-
   head if transferred in individual IP packets. For example a 10-byte
   voice packet transmitted using UDP/IP encapsulation incurs an over-
   head of 28 bytes (20 byte IP header, plus possibly 8 bytes UDP
   header), or 280%.  In addition, if each audio stream uses one UDP
   media session, the large number of packets will create heavy packet
   processing load for the intermediate media gateway devices that
   operate above the IP-layer, even if no processing of the user flow is
   actually required.  The available UDP port numbers may also become a
   limiting factor on the maximum number of sessions.

   Although the relatively high transport overhead may not constitute a
   critical traffic engineering factor in transport scenarios where net-
   work reaources are plentifull, the situation is quite different for
   many wireless access networks where T1/E1 links are used to carry
   packets from many voice users to the base stations. There, the con-
   cept of pooling multiple user flows into a more efficienty multi-
   plexed channel is highly appealing.

   Fortunately, for many applications, it is possible to multiplex a
   large number of sessions into a single IP packet to improve effi-
   ciency and scalability without incurring much multiplexing delay.
   For example, when long distance telephony is offered over the Inter-
   net, the IP telephony gateways or the mobile switching centers in a
   cellular network provide an interface between the existing circuit
   switched telephone networks (such as PSTN and cellular networks like
   CDMA/GSM/TDMA network) and the packet switched IP data networks. The
   voice calls between a pair of IP telephony gateways or the mobile
   switching centers can be multiplexed into a single UDP session.  As
   another example, in a CDMA based cellular network, an IP network may
   be used as the access network by the wireless service provider to
   connect the base stations to the mobile switching centers, part of
   whose function is to select the reverse direction radio frames and

   duplicate the forward direction radio frames for mobiles in soft
   handoff. In this case, the radio frames from different mobiles han-
   dled by the same base station, which can be either voice or data, can
   also be multiplexed into a single UDP session.

   Many such applications have stringent delay requirements. In the
   first example above, the usual transfer delay and delay jitter
   requirements for voice application apply.  In the second example, the
   duplicate radio frames in the reverse direction must be received by
   the mobile switching center within a small time window for the frame
   selection.

   RTP [4] is a protocol designed to provide various real time services
   to the application layer with no assumption on the underlying network
   providing timely delivery or quality-of-service commitments. It can
   be used when the network is not heavily loaded and the application it
   supports can adapt to the varying network conditions to some extent.
   To improve the transport efficiency, some multiplexing schemes have
   been proposed within the framework of RTP [1,2].

   Many of the features of RTP are designed to provide media control
   information to cope with the unavailability of QoS guarantees from
   the underlying network at the application layer. As such guarantees
   become available in modern/future IP networks, some of these features
   become unnecessary. These features are also of limited value to non-
   RTP applications (e.g., most commercial wireless voice traffic). In
   this document, we propose to use a lightweight encapsulation scheme
   based on UDP/IP for multiplexing application sessions. LIPE is
   designed to support multimedia traffic including both voice and data.
   We also include some discussions on how UDP/IP header compression can
   be incorporated within LIPE to further improve encapsulation effi-
   ciency.



2.  The LIPE Encapsulation Scheme

   The Lightweight IP Encapsulation (LIPE) uses either UDP/IP or IP as
   the transport layer. Each LIPE encapsulated payload consists of a
   variable number of multimedia data packet (MDP).  For each MDP, there
   is a multiplexing header (MH) that conveys transport and media
   specific information.

   The format of an IP packet conveying multiple MDPs over UDP using a
   minimum size MH is shown in Figure 1 (a).

   types simultaneously.  Section 6 explains how IPCP is used to nego-
   tiate for either type of encapsulation format.


2.1.  Basic
   The Multiplexing Header (MH) comprises of two components:  the MDP
   Header Extension bit (the E bit) and the MDP length field.  Optional
   Extension Headers can be supported via the E bit. The MH format is
   shown in Figure 3.

                   Figure 3: Multiplexing Header Format

   E bit: The Header Extension bit is the least significant bit of the
   MH header. It is set to one/zero to indicate the presence/absense of
   an extension header longer than 2 bytes. If the E bit is set to zero,
   the multiplexed header contains a 7 bit MDP length and a 2 bytes
   extended header identifier. If the E bit is set to one, it means
   there are more fields after the 2-byte Extended Header.

   MDP Length: a 7 bit MDP length field. This field indicates the size
   of the entire MDP packet in bytes including the E bit, Length field
   and optional Extension Headers (if present). For Type 0 Extended
   Header, the actual length is as indicated in the 7 bit field. For 
   Type 1 Extended Header, the actual length is 4 times the number 
   expressed in the 7 bit field.



2.2.  Extension

   Extension Headers are used to convey application specific informa-
   tion. They also facilitate customization of LIPE to incorporate addi-
   tional transport/session level control functionality such as sequence
   number, voice/video quality estimator.


2.2.1.  Type 0 Extended Header 

   The 16-bit Type 0 Extended Header (EH0) is the first

   field in any Extension Header.  It is used to identify MDPs belonging
   to specific small voice/video flows.  The format of an LIPE encapsu-
   lated payload with a EH0 Extension Header is shown in Figure 4(a).

   When X bit is clear, the following 3 bits are used as the CRC for the
   Extended Header. This means the UserID field is 12 bits. This version
   is used mostly for applications that generate small packets e.g.
   voice. The 12-bit UserID allows up to 4096 flows to be multiplexed
   into a single UDP/IP session or IP tunnel.


2.2.2.  Type 1 Extended Header 
   The 16-bit Type 1 Extended Header (EH1) is used to identify flows
   that generate large data packets.  The format of an LIPE encapsulated
   payload with a Type 1 Extension Header is shown in Figure 4(b). The
   least significant bit of the 1st byte of EH1 is the X bit.  When X is
   set to one, it indicates that a EOF bit and a 3-bit Seq Number fields
   exist.  This means when X bit is set, the UserID field is 11-bit.
   The EOF bit is set when there are more fragments to be transmitted.
   For the non-fragment case, this bit is clear.

   data. The format of the PID field is illustarted in Figure 6.

           Figure 7(b):  Carrying UMTS Interactive Data packets

   In this scenario, Type 1 Extended Header is used where the E bit
   is set to one and the X bit is set to one. The UserID is used to
   identify different user flows. The payload is the frame protocol (FP)
   PDU described in [TS25.413].

   Note that in our encapsulation scheme, no field is provided in the
   header for error checking purposes for data traffic. For this
   scenario, we rely on the link layer error detection capability (e.g.,
   CRC field in HDLC or ATM/AAL5) for LIPE/IP, or on the additional UDP
   checksum on LIPE/UDP/IP to provide for the overall LIPE payload error
   detection. We believe this level of protection is sufficient. For
   voice frames where multiplexing of packets from different users usu-
   ally take place, a header CRC is provided as an additional protection
   so that voice frames from different users can be salvaged should

   remaining bit errors exist.


2.4.  LIPE

   LIPE end-points need a mechanism to specify and negotiate UserID and
   TunnelID/UDP Destination port numbers.

   When LIPE/UDP/IP encapsulation is used, a specified Destination Port
   number is used to indicate the LIPE Signaling Channel. The format of
   the LIPE signaling message over this channel is illustrated in Figure
   8 (a).

   Here, the UDP Port Number identifies the LIPE Signaling Channel,
   the 4-bit LIPE Signaling Channel Type field is used to identify
   the LIPE Control Message Type, and the 4-bit Length (LNG) field
   identifies the length of Control Msg Payload expressed in bytes.

   When LIPE/IP encapsulation is used, a specified TunnelID number is
   used to indicate the LIPE signaling Channel. The format of the LIPE
   signaling message is illustrated in Figure 8 (b).

   Here, the TunnelID field identifies the LIPE Signaling Channel, the
   4-bit Type field is used to identiofy the Control Message Type, and
   the 4-bit (LNG) field is used to indicate the length of Control Msg
   Payload expressed in bytes.

   Three types of control messages are currently defined:  Type = 0
   Length= 1 Control Msg Payload = Tunnel id Type = 1 Length=12 Control
   Msg Payload = IMSI (10 bytes), UserId (2 bytes) Type = 2 Length=13

   Control Msg Payload = IMSI (10 bytes), UserId (2 bytes), Sequence
   Number.


Type 2 message can be used to transfer sequence number when there is a
handoff from one RNC to another.


3.  QoS

   Besides the traditional best-effort service, other services such as
   integrated service (including controlled load service and guaranteed
   service) and differentiated service have been defined. These ser-
   vices, by reserving certain network resources such as bandwidth, can
   provide the traffic with certain guarantees such as delay and loss.

   LIPE is compatible with both the DifServ and IntServ QoS models.  To
   support multiple QoS classes, the DSCP bits of the IP header can be
   used to request a particular PHB e.g., for high quality voice the IP
   packet with multiplexed audio frames can be marked with the EF code
   point; for low quality voice, the IP packet can be marked with one of
   the appropriate AF code points.

   LIPE specific QoS requirements may also be conveyed on an end-point
   specific basis via the TunnelID or UserID field.


4.  Multiplexing Policy

   Given the link MTU L_max, a UDP/IP packet can carry payload of up to
   L_max - H_ip - H_udp, where H_ip is the IP header length (20 bytes
   without option) and H_udp is the UDP header length (8 bytes). To
   limit the multiplexing delay, a multiplexing timer with a lifetime of
   T_mux is used. H_mh is the multiplexing header length. The encapsula-
   tion policy is as follows:

   a) If the total size of the received radio frames plus that of that
   of their H_mh exceeds L_max - H_ip - H_udp, send all the MDP frames
   except the most recently received one (no fragmentation of MDP) in
   one UDP packet, and restart the multiplexing timer. The newly
   received MDP is held for multiplexing with upcoming MDPs.

   b) If the multiplexing timer expires, send the accumulated MDPs in
   one UDP packet and restart the encapsulation timer.

5.  UDP/IP Header Compression

   Note that if IP headers are not required to do routing (say the
   underlying network is either ATM or MPLS), one can either remove or
   compress the UDP/IP (IP) header. That will increase further the
   bandwidth efficiency of using the LIPE scheme in a radio access net-
   work where the BSs have IP interfaces that run over ATM/MPLS net-
   works.

   When we map a certain UDP, or (IP+TID), tunnel into a particular
   MPLS/ATM connection, we need to ensure that the quality of service
   provided by the MPLS/ATM connection matches with the DSCP indicated
   in the IP header.


6.  Comparison of the LIPE scheme with other existing proposals

   This section compares 3 approaches for carrying multiplexed audio
   packets in terms of the overhead incurred. The 3 approaches con-
   sidered are cUDP/PPPMux, tCRTP, and LIPE. We assume that PPP/HDLC is
   the Layer 2 technology used.

   Approach 1  cUDP/PPPMux
      PPP/HDLC    4 bytes
      PPP ID      1 byte
      per stream
               PFF,length   1 byte
               cUDP/IP      3 byte
               payload

   Approach 2  tCRTP
      PPP/HDLC    4 bytes
      cIP          3 byte
      L2TP HC      1 byte
      PPPMuxID     1 byte
      PPPID        1 byte
      per stream
              PFF,length   1 byte
               cUDP/IP      3 byte
               payload

   Approach 3 LIPE
      PPP/HDLC    4 bytes
      cUDP/IP     3 byte
      per stream
                 length 1 byte
                 UID  2 bytes
                 payload

   For approach 3, the per stream overhead is 3 bytes while for
   approaches 1 & 2, the per stream overhead is 4 bytes.


7.  PPP

   A new IPCP Configuration Option is used to request LIPE operation for
   the PPP link.  A summary of the LIPE  Configuration Option format for
   the IP Control Protocol (IPCP) is shown below.  The fields are
   transmit- ted from left to right.

       0                   1
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     Type      |    Length     |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      Type

         TBD

      Length

         3

   The new IPCP option is used only as a hint to the peer that LIPE
   operation is preferred by the sender.  Support of LIPE operations  is
   negotiated in each direction independently. Acknowledgement of the
   LIPE IPCP Option (TBD) does not obligate a peer to transmit LIPE
   frames.  Non LIPE-speakers SHOULD instead send IPCP Configure- Reject
   for the option.

   If either IPCP Configure-Nak or IPCP Configure-Reject is received for
   this option, then the next transmitted IPCP Configure-Request MUST
   NOT include this option. If the received IPCP Configure-Request mes-
   sage does not contain a  LIPE IPCP option, an implementation MUST NOT
   send an unsolicited Configure-Nak for the option.

   (An implementation of LIPE that is already in LIPE framing mode and
   receives this option in an IPCP Configure-Request message MAY, both
   for clarity and for convergence reasons, elect to send IPCP
   Configure-Ack.  It MUST NOT restart IPCP nor change framing modes in
   this case.)

   The size of a LIPE encapsulated frame MUST NOT exceed the maximum
   receive unit (MRU) size negotiated during LCP [10].

8.  Negotiating usage of LIPE

   When the layer 2 protocol is PPP, the usage of various LIPE confi-
   guration options can be negociated via the IP Compression Protocol
   option of IPCP:

   IPCP Option 2: IP configuration protocol
       Network Protocol: TBD indicates LIPE
   sub-option 1 enables use of IP session
   sub-option 2 enables use of UDP/IP session


9.  Security

   This draft does not impose additional security considerations beyond
   those that apply to PPP and header-compression schemes over PPP.


10.  Summary

   LIPE is designed to support multimedia traffic when certain resource
   guarantees are available from the underlying network. It is based on
   UDP/IP or IP; hence is lightweight compared with other proposals
   based on RTP [1,2]. As IP based networks become more and more sophis-
   ticated and offer various levels of resource guarantees [5], this
   scheme is more suitable to the modern/future IP architecture compared
   with RTP based schemes.

   The 15-bit UserID field in LIPE facilitates its usage in the third
   generation wireless system where handoffs may occur during the life-
   time of a session. By having a larger user space, we can greatly
   reduce the signalling overhead due to identifier re-negotiation dur-
   ing a handoff.

   A multiplexing policy is also outlined for LIPE.
