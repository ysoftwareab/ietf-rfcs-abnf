Internet-Draft             QUIC Manageability              November 2020


1.  Introduction

   QUIC [QUIC-TRANSPORT] is a new transport protocol currently under
   development in the IETF QUIC working group, focusing on support of
   semantics as needed for HTTP/2 [QUIC-HTTP].  Based on current
   deployment practices, QUIC is encapsulated in UDP and encrypted by
   default.  The current version of QUIC integrates TLS [QUIC-TLS] to
   encrypt all payload data and most control information.

   Given that QUIC is an end-to-end transport protocol, all information
   in the protocol header, even that which can be inspected, is not
   meant to be mutable by the network, and is therefore integrity-
   protected.  While less information is visible to the network than for
   TCP, integrity protection can also simplify troubleshooting because
   none of the nodes on the network path can modify the transport layer
   information.

   This document provides guidance for network operation on the
   management of QUIC traffic.  This includes guidance on how to
   interpret and utilize information that is exposed by QUIC to the
   network as well as explaining requirement and assumptions that the
   QUIC protocol design takes toward the expected network treatment.  It
   also discusses how common network management practices will be
   impacted by QUIC.

   Since QUIC's wire image [WIRE-IMAGE] is integrity protected and not
   modifiable on path, in-network operations are not possible without
   terminating the QUIC connection, for instance using a back-to-back
   proxy.  Proxy operations are not in scope for this document.  QUIC
   proxies must be fully-fledged QUIC endpoints, implementing the
   transport as defined in [QUIC-TRANSPORT] and [QUIC-TLS] as well as
   proxy-relevant semantics for the application(s) running over QUIC
   (e.g.  HTTP/3 as defined in [QUIC-HTTP]).

   Network management is not a one-size-fits-all endeavour: practices
   considered necessary or even mandatory within enterprise networks
   with certain compliance requirements, for example, would be
   impermissible on other networks without those requirements.  This
   document therefore does not make any specific recommendations as to
   which practices should or should not be applied; for each practice,
   it describes what is and is not possible with the QUIC transport
   protocol as defined.

   QUIC is at the moment very much a moving target.  This document
   refers the state of the QUIC working group drafts as well as to
   changes under discussion, via issues and pull requests in GitHub
   current as of the time of writing.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Features of the QUIC Wire Image

   In this section, we discusses those aspects of the QUIC transport
   protocol that have an impact on the design and operation of devices
   that forward QUIC packets.  Here, we are concerned primarily with the
   unencrypted part of QUIC's wire image [WIRE-IMAGE], which we define
   as the information available in the packet header in each QUIC
   packet, and the dynamics of that information.  Since QUIC is a
   versioned protocol, the wire image of the header format can also
   change from version to version.  However, at least the mechanism by
   which a receiver can determine which version is used and the meaning
   and location of fields used in the version negotiation process is
   invariant [QUIC-INVARIANTS].

   This document describes only version 1 the QUIC protocol, whose wire
   image is fully defined in [QUIC-TRANSPORT] and [QUIC-TLS].  Note that
   features of the wire image described herein and in those documents
   may change in future versions of the protocol, and cannot be used to
   identify QUIC as a protocol or to infer the behavior of future
   versions of QUIC.  Section 9.1 provides non-normative guidance on the
   identification of QUIC version 1 packets compared to other deployed
   versions at the date if publication.

2.1.  QUIC Packet Header Structure

   QUIC packets may have either a long header, or a short header.  The
   first bit of the QUIC header us the Header Form bit, and indicates
   which type of header is present.

   The long header exposes more information.  It is used during
   connection establishment, including version negotiation, retry, and
   0-RTT data.  It contains a version number, as well as source and
   destination connection IDs for grouping packets belonging to the same
   flow.  The definition and location of these fields in the QUIC long
   header are invariant for future versions of QUIC, although future
   versions of QUIC may provide additional fields in the long header
   [QUIC-INVARIANTS].

Internet-Draft             QUIC Manageability              November 2020


   Short headers are used after connection establishment, and contain
   only an optional destination connection ID and the spin bit for RTT
   measurement.

   The following information is exposed in QUIC packet headers:

   *  "fixed bit": the second most significant bit of the first octet
      most QUIC packets of the current version is currently set to 1,
      for demultiplexing with other UDP-encapsulated protocols.

   *  latency spin bit: the third most significant bit of first octet in
      the short packet header.  The spin bit is set by endpoints such
      that tracking edge transitions can be used to passively observe
      end-to-end RTT.  See Section 3.7.2 for further details.

   *  header type: the long header has a 2 bit packet type field
      following the Header Form and fixed bits.  Header types correspond
      to stages of the handshake; see Section 17.2 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]
      for details.

   *  version number: the version number present in the long header, and
      identifies the version used for that packet.  Note that during
      Version Negotiation (see Section 2.8, and Section 17.2.1 of
      [QUIC-TRANSPORT], the version number field has a special value
      (0x00000000) that identifies the packet as a Version Negotiation
      packet.  QUIC versions that start with 0xff are IETF drafts.  QUIC
      versions that start with 0x0000 are reserved for IETF consensus
      documents, for example the QUIC version 1 is expected to use
      version 0x00000001.

   *  source and destination connection ID: short and long packet
      headers carry a destination connection ID, a variable-length field
      that can be used to identify the connection associated with a QUIC
      packet, for load-balancing and NAT rebinding purposes; see
      Section 4.3 and Section 2.6.  Long packet headers additionally
      carry a source connection ID.  The source connection ID
      corresponds to the destination connection ID the source would like
      to have on packets sent to it, and is only present on long packet
      headers.  On long header packets, the length of the connection IDs
      is also present; on short header packets, the length of the
      destination connection ID is implicit.

   *  length: the length of the remaining QUIC packet after the length
      field, present on long headers.  This field is used to implement
      coalesced packets during the handshake (see Section 2.2).

Internet-Draft             QUIC Manageability              November 2020


   *  token: Initial packets may contain a token, a variable-length
      opaque value optionally sent from client to server, used for
      validating the client's address.  Retry packets also contain a
      token, which can be used by the client in an Initial packet on a
      subsequent connection attempt.  The length of the token is
      explicit in both cases.

   Retry (Section 17.2.5 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]) and Version Negotiation
   (Section 17.2.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]) packets are not encrypted or
   obfuscated in any way.  For other kinds of packets, other information
   in the packet headers is cryptographically obfuscated:

   *  packet number: All packets except Version Negotiation and Retry
      packets have an associated packet number; however, this packet
      number is encrypted, and therefore not of use to on-path
      observers.  The offset of the packet number is encoded in the
      header for packets with long headers, while it is implicit
      (depending on Destination Connection ID length) in short header
      packets.  The length of the packet number is cryptographically
      obfuscated.

   *  key phase: The Key Phase bit, present in short headers, specifies
      the keys used to encrypt the packet, supporting key rotation.  The
      Key Phase bit is cryptographically obfuscated.

2.2.  Coalesced Packets

   Multiple QUIC packets may be coalesced into a UDP datagram, with a
   datagram carrying one or more long header packets followed by zero or
   one short header packets.  When packets are coalesced, the Length
   fields in the long headers are used to separate QUIC packets.  The
   length header field is variable length and its position in the header
   is also variable depending on the length of the source and
   destination connection ID.  See Section 4.6 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

2.3.  Use of Port Numbers

   Applications that have a mapping for TCP as well as QUIC are expected
   to use the same port number for both services.  However, as with TCP-
   based services, especially when application layer information is
   encrypted, there is no guarantee that a specific application will use
   the registered port, or the used port is carrying traffic belonging
   to the respective registered service.  For example, [QUIC-TRANSPORT]
   specifies the use of Alt-Svc for discovery of QUIC/HTTP services on
   other ports.

Internet-Draft             QUIC Manageability              November 2020


   Further, as QUIC has a connection ID, it is also possible to maintain
   multiple QUIC connections over one 5-tuple.  However, if the
   connection ID is not present in the packet header, all packets of the
   5-tuple belong to the same QUIC connection.

2.4.  The QUIC handshake

   New QUIC connections are established using a handshake, which is
   distinguishable on the wire and contains some information that can be
   passively observed.

   To illustrate the information visible in the QUIC wire image during
   the handshake, we first show the general communication pattern
   visible in the UDP datagrams containing the QUIC handshake, then
   examine each of the datagrams in detail.

   In the nominal case, the QUIC handshake can be recognized on the wire
   through at least four datagrams we'll call "QUIC Client Hello", "QUIC
   Server Hello", and "Initial Completion", and "Handshake Completion",
   for purposes of this illustration, as shown in Figure 1.

   Packets in the handshake belong to three separate cryptographic and
   transport contexts ("Initial", which contains observable payload, and
   "Handshake" and "1-RTT", which do not).  QUIC packets in separate
   contexts during the handshake are generally coalesced (see
   Section 2.2) in order to reduce the number of UDP datagrams sent
   during the handshake.

   As shown here, the client can send 0-RTT data as soon as it has sent
   its Client Hello, and the server can send 1-RTT data as soon as it
   has sent its Server Hello.

   A typical handshake starts with the client sending of a QUIC Client
   Hello datagram as shown in Figure 2, which elicits a QUIC Server
   Hello datagram as shown in Figure 3 typically containing three
   packets: an Initial packet with the Server Hello, a Handshake packet
   with the rest of the server's side of the TLS handshake, and initial
   1-RTT data, if present.

   The content of QUIC Initial packets are encrypted using Initial
   Secrets, which are derived from a per-version constant and the
   client's destination connection ID; they are therefore observable by
   any on-path device that knows the per-version constant; we therefore
   consider these as visible in our illustration.  The content of QUIC
   Handshake packets are encrypted using keys established during the
   initial handshake exchange, and are therefore not visible.

   Initial, Handshake, and the Short Header packets transmitted after
   the handshake belong to cryptographic and transport contexts.  The
   Initial Completion Figure 4 and the Handshake Completion Figure 5
   datagrams finish these first two contexts, by sending the final
   acknowledgment and finishing the transmission of CRYPTO frames.

   The Client Hello datagram exposes version number, source and
   destination connection IDs in the clear.  Information in the TLS
   Client Hello frame, including any TLS Server Name Indication (SNI)
   present, is obfuscated using the Initial secret.  The QUIC PADDING
   frame shown here may be present to ensure the Client Hello datagram
   has a minimum size of 1200 octets, to mitigate the possibility of
   handshake amplification.  Note that the location of PADDING is
   implementation-dependent, and PADDING frames may not appear in the
   Initial packet in a coalesced packet.

   0-RTT protected long header packets may be sent from the client to
   the server after the Client Hello datagram, containing the rest of
   the 0-RTT data.  The amount of 0-RTT protected data is limited by the
   initial congestion window, typically around 10 packets [RFC6928].

2.5.  Integrity Protection of the Wire Image

   As soon as the cryptographic context is established, all information
   in the QUIC header, including information exposed in the packet
   header, is integrity protected.  Further, information that was sent
   and exposed in handshake packets sent before the cryptographic
   context was established are validated later during the cryptographic
   handshake.  Therefore, devices on path MUST NOT change any
   information or bits in QUIC packet headers, since alteration of
   header information will lead to a failed integrity check at the
   receiver, and can even lead to connection termination.

2.6.  Connection ID and Rebinding

   The connection ID in the QUIC packet headers allows routing of QUIC
   packets at load balancers on other than five-tuple information,
   ensuring that related flows are appropriately balanced together; and
   to allow rebinding of a connection after one of the endpoint's
   addresses changes - usually the client's, in the case of the HTTP
   binding.  Client and server negotiate connection IDs during the
   handshake; typically, however, only the server will request a
   connection ID for the lifetime of the connection.  Connection IDs for
   either endpoint may change during the lifetime of a connection, with
   the new connection ID being negotiated via encrypted frames.  See
   Section 5.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

   Server-generated connection IDs should seek to obscure any encoding,
   of routing identities or any other information.  Exposing the server
   mapping would allow linkage of multiple IP addresses to the same host
   if the server also supports migration.  Furthermore, this opens an
   attack vector on specific servers or pools.

   The best way to obscure an encoding is to appear random to observers,
   which is most rigorously achieved with encryption.  Even when
   encrypted, a scheme could embed the unencrypted length of the
   Connection ID in the Connection ID itself, instead of remembering it,
   e.g. by using the first few bits to indicate a certain size of a
   well-known set of possible sizes with multiple values that indicate
   the same size but are selected randomly.

   [QUIC_LB] further specified possible algorithms to generate
   Connection IDs at load balancers.

2.7.  Packet Numbers

   The packet number field is always present in the QUIC packet header;
   however, it is always encrypted.  The encryption key for packet
   number protection on handshake packets sent before cryptographic
   context establishment is specific to the QUIC version, while packet
   number protection on subsequent packets uses secrets derived from the
   end-to-end cryptographic context.  Packet numbers are therefore not
   part of the wire image that is visible to on-path observers.

2.8.  Version Negotiation and Greasing

   Version negotiation is not protected, given the used protection
   mechanism can change with the version.  However, the choices provided
   in the list of version in the Version Negotiation packet will be
   validated as soon as the cryptographic context has been established.
   Therefore any manipulation of this list will be detected and will
   cause the endpoints to terminate the connection.

   Also note that the list of versions in the Version Negotiation packet
   may contain reserved versions.  This mechanism is used to avoid
   ossification in the implementation on the selection mechanism.
   Further, a client may send a Initial Client packet with a reserved
   version number to trigger version negotiation.  In the Version
   Negotiation packet the connection ID and packet number of the Client
   Initial packet are reflected to provide a proof of return-
   routability.  Therefore changing these information will also cause
   the connection to fail.

   QUIC is expected to evolve rapidly, so new versions, both
   experimental and IETF standard versions, will be deployed in the
   Internet more often than with traditional Internet- and transport-
   layer protocols.  Using a particular version number to recognize
   valid QUIC traffic is likely to persistently miss a fraction of QUIC
   flows and completely fail in the multi-year timeframe so therefore
   not recommended.

3.  Network-visible information about QUIC flows

   This section addresses the different kinds of observations and
   inferences that can be made about QUIC flows by a passive observer in
   the network based on the wire image in Section 2.  Here we assume a
   bidirectional observer (one that can see packets in both directions
   in the sequence in which they are carried on the wire) unless noted.

3.1.  Identifying QUIC traffic

   The QUIC wire image is not specifically designed to be
   distinguishable from other UDP traffic.

   The only application binding defined by the IETF QUIC WG is HTTP/3
   [QUIC-HTTP] at the time of this writing; however, many other
   applications are currently being defined and deployed over QUIC, so
   an assumption that all QUIC traffic is HTTP/3 is not valid.  HTTP
   over QUIC uses UDP port 443 by default, although URLs referring to
   resources available over HTTP over QUIC may specify alternate port
   numbers.  Simple assumptions about whether a given flow is using QUIC
   based upon a UDP port number may therefore not hold; see also
   [RFC7605] section 5.

   While the second most significant bit (0x40) of the first octet is
   set to 1 in most QUIC packets of the current version (see
   Section 2.1), this method of recognizing QUIC traffic is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  First, it only provides one bit of information and is
   quite prone to collide with UDP-based protocols other than those that
   this static bit is meant to allow multiplexing with.  Second, this
   feature of the wire image is not invariant [QUIC-INVARIANTS] and may
   change in future versions of the protocol, or even be negotiated
   after handshake via future transport parameters.

3.1.1.  Identifying Negotiated Version

   An in-network observer assuming that a set of packets belongs to a
   QUIC flow can infer the version number in use by observing the
   handshake: an Initial packet with a given version from a client to
   which a server responds with an Initial packet with the same version
   implies acceptance of that version.

   Negotiated version cannot be identified for flows for which a
   handshake is not observed, such as in the case of connection
   migration; however, these flows can be associated with flows for
   which a version has been identified; see Section 3.4.

   This document focuses on QUIC Version 1, and this section applies
   only to packets belonging to Version 1 QUIC flows; for purposes of
   on-path observation, it assumes that these packets have been
   identified as such through the observation of a version negotiation.

3.1.2.  Rejection of Garbage Traffic

   A related question is whether a first packet of a given flow on known
   QUIC-associated port is a valid QUIC packet, in order to support in-
   network filtering of garbage UDP packets (reflection attacks, random
   backscatter).  While heuristics based on the first byte of the packet
   (packet type) could be used to separate valid from invalid first
   packet types, the deployment of such heuristics is not recommended,
   as packet types may have different meanings in future versions of the
   protocol.

3.2.  Connection confirmation

   Connection establishment uses Initial, Handshake, and Retry packets
   containing a TLS handshake.  Connection establishment can therefore
   be detected using heuristics similar to those used to detect TLS over
   TCP.  A client using 0-RTT connection may also send data packets in
   0-RTT Protected packets directly after the Initial packet containing
   the TLS Client Hello.  Since these packets may be reordered in the
   network, note that 0-RTT Protected data packets may be seen before
   the Initial packet.

   Note that clients send Initial packets before servers do, servers
   send Handshake packets before clients do, and only clients send
   Initial packets with tokens, so the sides of a connection can be
   generally be confirmed by an on-path observer.  An attempted
   connection after Retry can be detected by correlating the token on
   the Retry with the token on the subsequent Initial packet.

3.3.  Application Identification

   The cleartext TLS handshake may contain Server Name Indication (SNI)
   [RFC6066], by which the client reveals the name of the server it
   intends to connect to, in order to allow the server to present a
   certificate based on that name.  It may also contain information from
   Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) [RFC7301], by which the
   client exposes the names of application-layer protocols it supports;
   an observer can deduce that one of those protocols will be used if
   the connection continues.

   Work is currently underway in the TLS working group to encrypt the
   SNI in TLS 1.3 [TLS-ESNI].  If used with QUIC, this would make SNI-
   based application identification impossible through passive
   measurement.

Internet-Draft             QUIC Manageability              November 2020


3.3.1.  Extracting Server Name Indication (SNI) Information

   If the SNI is not encrypted it can be derived from the QUIC Initial
   packet by calculating the Initial Secret to decrypt the packet
   payload and parse the QUIC CRYPTO Frame containing the TLS
   ClientHello.

   As both the initial salt for the Initial Secret as well as CRYPTO
   frame itself are version-specific, the first step is always to parse
   the version number (second to sixth byte of the long header).  Note
   that only long header packets carry the version number, so it is
   necessary to also check the if first bit of the QUIC packet is set to
   1, indicating a long header.

   Note, that proprietary QUIC versions, that have been deployed before
   standardization, might not set the first bit in a QUIC long header
   packets to 1.  To parse these versions example code is provided in
   the appendix (see Section 9.1), however, it is expected that these
   versions will gradually disappear over time.

   When the version has been identified as QUIC version 1, the packet
   type needs to be verified as an Initial packet by checking that the
   third and fourth bit of the header are both set to 0.  Then the
   Client Destination Connection ID needs to be extracted to calculate
   the Initial Secret together with the version specific initial salt,
   as described in [QUIC-TLS].  The length of the connection ID is
   indicated in the 6th byte of the header followed by the connection ID
   itself.

   To determine the end of the header and find the start of the payload
   further the packet number length, the source connection ID length, as
   well as the token length need to be extracted.  The packet number
   length is defined by the seventh and eight bits of the header as
   described in section 17.2. of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  The source
   connection ID length is specified in the byte after the destination
   connection ID.  And the token length, which follows the source
   connection ID, is a variable length integer as specified in section
   16 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

Internet-Draft             QUIC Manageability              November 2020


   Finally after decryption, the Initial Client packet can be parsed to
   detect the CRYPTO frame that contains the TLS Client Hello, which
   then can be respectively parsed similar as for all other TLS
   connections.  The Initial client packet may contain other frames, so
   the first byte of each frame need to be checked to identify the frame
   type and the skip over the frame.  Note that the length of the frames
   is dependent on the frame type.  Usually for QUIC version 1, the
   packet is expected to only carry the CRYPTO frame and optionally
   padding frames.  However, padding which is one byte of zeros, may
   also occur before or after the CRYPTO frame.

3.4.  Flow association

   The QUIC Connection ID (see Section 2.6) is designed to allow an on-
   path device such as a load-balancer to associate two flows as
   identified by five-tuple when the address and port of one of the
   endpoints changes; e.g. due to NAT rebinding or server IP address
   migration.  An observer keeping flow state can associate a connection
   ID with a given flow, and can associate a known flow with a new flow
   when when observing a packet sharing a connection ID and one endpoint
   address (IP address and port) with the known flow.

   However, since the connection ID may change multiple times during the
   lifetime of a flow, and the negotiation of connection ID changes is
   encrypted, packets with the same 5-tuple but different connection IDs
   may or may not belong to the same connection.

   The connection ID value should be treated as opaque; see Section 4.3
   for caveats regarding connection ID selection at servers.

3.5.  Flow teardown

   QUIC does not expose the end of a connection; the only indication to
   on-path devices that a flow has ended is that packets are no longer
   observed.  Stateful devices on path such as NATs and firewalls must
   therefore use idle timeouts to determine when to drop state for QUIC
   flows, see further section Section 4.1.

3.6.  Flow symmetry measurement

   QUIC explicitly exposes which side of a connection is a client and
   which side is a server during the handshake.  In addition, the
   symmetry of a flow (whether primarily client-to-server, primarily
   server-to-client, or roughly bidirectional, as input to basic traffic
   classification techniques) can be inferred through the measurement of
   data rate in each direction.  While QUIC traffic is protected and
   ACKs may be padded, padding is not required.

Internet-Draft             QUIC Manageability              November 2020


3.7.  Round-Trip Time (RTT) Measurement

   Round-trip time of QUIC flows can be inferred by observation once per
   flow, during the handshake, as in passive TCP measurement; this
   requires parsing of the QUIC packet header and recognition of the
   handshake, as illustrated in Section 2.4.  It can also be inferred
   during the flow's lifetime, if the endpoints use the spin bit
   facility described below and in [QUIC-TRANSPORT], section 17.3.1.

3.7.1.  Measuring initial RTT

   In the common case, the delay between the Initial packet containing
   the TLS Client Hello and the Handshake packet containing the TLS
   Server Hello represents the RTT component on the path between the
   observer and the server.  The delay between the TLS Server Hello and
   the Handshake packet containing the TLS Finished message sent by the
   client represents the RTT component on the path between the observer
   and the client.  While the client may send 0-RTT Protected packets
   after the Initial packet during 0-RTT connection re-establishment,
   these can be ignored for RTT measurement purposes.

   Handshake RTT can be measured by adding the client-to-observer and
   observer-to-server RTT components together.  This measurement
   necessarily includes any transport and application layer delay (the
   latter mainly caused by the asymmetric crypto operations associated
   with the TLS handshake) at both sides.

3.7.2.  Using the Spin Bit for Passive RTT Measurement

   The spin bit provides an additional method to measure per-flow RTT
   from observation points on the network path throughout the duration
   of a connection.  Endpoint participation in spin bit signaling is
   optional in QUIC.  That is, while its location is fixed in this
   version of QUIC, an endpoint can unilaterally choose to not support
   "spinning" the bit.  Use of the spin bit for RTT measurement by
   devices on path is only possible when both endpoints enable it.  Some
   endpoints may disable use of the spin bit by default, others only in
   specific deployment scenarios, e.g. for servers and clients where the
   RTT would reveal the presence of a VPN or proxy.  To avoid making
   these connections identifiable based on the usage of the spin bit, it
   is recommended that all endpoints randomly disable "spinning" for at
   least one eighth of connections, even if otherwise enabled by
   default.  An endpoint not participating in spin bit signaling for a
   given connection can use a fixed spin value for the duration of the
   connection, or can set the bit randomly on each packet sent.

   When in use and a QUIC flow sends data continuously, the latency spin
   bit in each direction changes value once per round-trip time (RTT).
   An on-path observer can observe the time difference between edges
   (changes from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1) in the spin bit signal in a single
   direction to measure one sample of end-to-end RTT.

   Note that this measurement, as with passive RTT measurement for TCP,
   includes any transport protocol delay (e.g., delayed sending of
   acknowledgements) and/or application layer delay (e.g., waiting for a
   response to be generated).  It therefore provides devices on path a
   good instantaneous estimate of the RTT as experienced by the
   application.  A simple linear smoothing or moving minimum filter can
   be applied to the stream of RTT information to get a more stable
   estimate.

   However, application-limited and flow-control-limited senders can
   have application and transport layer delay, respectively, that are
   much greater than network RTT.  When the sender is application-
   limited and e.g. only sends small amount of periodic application
   traffic, where that period is longer than the RTT, measuring the spin
   bit provides information about the application period, not the
   network RTT.

   Since the spin bit logic at each endpoint considers only samples from
   packets that advance the largest packet number, signal generation
   itself is resistant to reordering.  However, reordering can cause
   problems at an observer by causing spurious edge detection and
   therefore inaccurate (i.e., lower) RTT estimates, if reordering
   occurs across a spin-bit flip in the stream.

   Simple heuristics based on the observed data rate per flow or changes
   in the RTT series can be used to reject bad RTT samples due to lost
   or reordered edges in the spin signal, as well as application or flow
   control limitation; for example, QoF [TMA-QOF] rejects component RTTs
   significantly higher than RTTs over the history of the flow.  These
   heuristics may use the handshake RTT as an initial RTT estimate for a
   given flow.  Usually such heuristics would also detect if the spin is
   either constant or randomly set for a connection.

   An on-path observer that can see traffic in both directions (from
   client to server and from server to client) can also use the spin bit
   to measure "upstream" and "downstream" component RTT; i.e, the
   component of the end-to-end RTT attributable to the paths between the
   observer and the server and the observer and the client,
   respectively.  It does this by measuring the delay between a spin
   edge observed in the upstream direction and that observed in the
   downstream direction, and vice versa.

4.  Specific Network Management Tasks

   In this section, we review specific network management and
   measurement techniques and how QUIC's design impacts them.

4.1.  Stateful treatment of QUIC traffic

   Stateful treatment of QUIC traffic (e.g., at a firewall or NAT
   middlebox) is possible through QUIC traffic and version
   identification (Section 3.1) and observation of the handshake for
   connection confirmation (Section 3.2).  The lack of any visible end-
   of-flow signal (Section 3.5) means that this state must be purged
   either through timers or through least-recently-used eviction,
   depending on application requirements.

   [RFC4787] recommends a 2 minute timeout interval for UDP, however,
   often timer are lower in the range of 15 to 30 second.  In constrast
   [RFC5382] recommends a timeout of more than 2 hours for TCP, given
   TCP is a connection-oriented protocol with well defined closure
   semantics.  For network devices that are QUIC-aware, it is
   recommended to also use longer timeouts for QUIC traffic, as QUIC is
   connection-oriented and as such a handshake packet from the server
   indicates the willingness of the server to communicate with the
   client.

   The QUIC header optionally contains a Connection ID which can be used
   as additional entropy beyond the 5-tuple, if needed.  The QUIC
   handshake needs to be observed in order to understand whether the
   Connection ID is present and what length it has.  However, Connection
   IDs may be renegotiated during a connection, and this renegotiation
   is not visible to the path.  Keying state off the Connection ID may
   therefore cause undetectable and unrecoverable loss of state in the
   middle of a connection.  Use of Connection ID specifically
   discouraged for NAT applications.

4.2.  Passive network performance measurement and troubleshooting

   Limited RTT measurement is possible by passive observation of QUIC
   traffic; see Section 3.7.  No passive measurement of loss is possible
   with the present wire image.  Extremely limited observation of
   upstream congestion may be possible via the observation of CE
   markings on ECN-enabled QUIC traffic.

Internet-Draft             QUIC Manageability              November 2020


4.3.  Server cooperation with load balancers

   In the case of content distribution networking architectures
   including load balancers, the connection ID provides a way for the
   server to signal information about the desired treatment of a flow to
   the load balancers.  Guidance on assigning connection IDs is given in
   [QUIC-APPLICABILITY].

4.4.  DDoS Detection and Mitigation

   Current practices in detection and mitigation of Distributed Denial
   of Service (DDoS) attacks generally involves classification of
   incoming traffic (as packets, flows, or some other aggregate) into
   "good" (productive) and "bad" (DDoS) traffic, then differential
   treatment of this traffic to forward only good traffic, to the extent
   possible.  This operation is often done in a separate specialized
   mitigation environment through which all traffic is filtered; a
   generalized architecture for separation of concerns in mitigation is
   given in [DOTS-ARCH].

   Key to successful DDoS mitigation is efficient classification of this
   traffic in the mitigation environment.  Limited first-packet garbage
   detection as in Section 3.1.2 and stateful tracking of QUIC traffic
   as in Section 4.1 above may be useful during classification.

   Note that the use of a connection ID to support connection migration
   renders 5-tuple based filtering insufficient and requires more state
   to be maintained by DDoS defense systems.  For the common case of NAT
   rebinding, DDoS defense systems can detect a change in client's
   endpoint address by linking flows based on the first 8 bytes of the
   server's connection IDs, provided the server is using at least 8-
   bytes-long connection IDs.  QUIC's linkability resistance ensures
   that a deliberate connection migration is accompanied by a change in
   the connection ID and necessitate that connection ID aware DDoS
   defense system must have the same information about connection IDs as
   the load balancer [I-D.ietf-quic-load-balancers].  This may be
   complicated where mitigation and load balancing environments are
   logically separate.

   It is questionable whether connection migrations must be supported
   during a DDoS attack.  If the connection migration is not visible to
   the network that performs the DDoS detection, an active, migrated
   QUIC connection may be blocked by such a system under attack.  As
   soon as the connection blocking is detected by the client, the client

   clients migrate to a new path, they should be prepared for the
   migration to fail and attempt to reconnect quickly.

4.5.  UDP Policing

   Today, UDP is the most prevalent DDoS vector, since it is easy for
   compromised non-admin applications to send a flood of large UDP
   packets (while with TCP the attacker gets throttled by the congestion
   controller) or to craft reflection and amplification attacks.
   Networks should therefore be prepared for UDP flood attacks on ports
   used for QUIC traffic.  One possible response to this threat is to
   police UDP traffic on the network, allocating a fixed portion of the
   network capacity to UDP and blocking UDP datagram over that cap.

   The recommended way to police QUIC packets is to either drop them all
   or to throttle them based on the hash of the UDP datagram's source
   and destination addresses, blocking a portion of the hash space that
   corresponds to the fraction of UDP traffic one wishes to drop.  When
   the handshake is blocked, QUIC-capable applications may failover to
   TCP (at least applications using well-known UDP ports).  However,
   blindly blocking a significant fraction of QUIC packets will allow
   many QUIC handshakes to complete, preventing a TCP failover, but the
   connections will suffer from severe packet loss.

4.6.  Distinguishing acknowledgment traffic

   Some deployed in-network functions distinguish pure-acknowledgment
   (ACK) packets from packets carrying upper-layer data in order to
   attempt to enhance performance, for example by queueing ACKs
   differently or manipulating ACK signaling.  Distinguishing ACK
   packets is trivial in TCP, but not supported by QUIC, since
   acknowledgment signaling is carried inside QUIC's encrypted payload,
   and ACK manipulation is impossible.  Specifically, heuristics
   attempting to distinguish ACK-only packets from payload-carrying
   packets based on packet size are likely to fail, and are emphatically
   NOT RECOMMENDED.

4.7.  QoS support and ECMP

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: this is a bit speculative; keep?]

   QUIC does not provide any additional information on requirements on
   Quality of Service (QoS) provided from the network.  QUIC assumes
   that all packets with the same 5-tuple {dest addr, source addr,
   protocol, dest port, source port} will receive similar network
   treatment.  That means all stream that are multiplexed over the same
   QUIC connection require the same network treatment and are handled by
   the same congestion controller.  If differential network treatment is
   desired, multiple QUIC connections to the same server might be used,
   given that establishing a new connection using 0-RTT support is cheap
   and fast.

   QoS mechanisms in the network MAY also use the connection ID for
   service differentiation, as a change of connection ID is bound to a
   change of address which anyway is likely to lead to a re-route on a
   different path with different network characteristics.

   Given that QUIC is more tolerant of packet re-ordering than TCP (see
   Section 2.7), Equal-cost multi-path routing (ECMP) does not
   necessarily need to be flow based.  However, 5-tuple (plus eventually
   connection ID if present) matching is still beneficial for QoS given
   all packets are handled by the same congestion controller.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   Supporting manageability of QUIC traffic inherently involves
   tradeoffs with the confidentiality of QUIC's control information;
   this entire document is therefore security-relevant.

7.  Contributors

   Dan Druta contributed text to Section 4.4.  Igor Lubashev contributed
   text to Section 4.3 on the use of the connection ID for load
   balancing.  Marcus Ilhar contributed text to Section 3.7 on the use
   of the spin bit.  The pseudo provided in the appendix is based on
   input provided by David Schinazi.

9.1.  Distinguishing IETF QUIC and Google QUIC Versions

   This section contains algorithms that allows parsing versions from
   both Google QUIC and IETF QUIC.  These mechanisms will become
   irrelevant when IETF QUIC is fully deployed and Google QUIC is
   deprecated.

   Note that other than this appendix, nothing in this document applies
   to Google QUIC.  And the purpose of this appendix is merely to
   distinguish IETF QUIC from any versions of Google QUIC.

   Conceptually, a Google QUIC version is an opaque 32bit field.  When
   we refer to a version with four printable characters, we use its
   ASCII representation: for example, Q050 refers to {'Q', '0', '5',
   '0'} which is equal to {0x51, 0x30, 0x35, 0x30}. Otherwise, we use
   its hexadecimal representation: for example, 0xff00001d refers to
   {0xff, 0x00, 0x00, 0x1d}.

   QUIC versions that start with 'Q' or 'T' followed by three digits are
   Google QUIC versions.  Versions up to and including 43 are documented
   by <https://docs.google.com/document/d/
   1WJvyZflAO2pq77yOLbp9NsGjC1CHetAXV8I0fQe-B_U/preview>.  Versions
   Q046, Q050, T050, and T051 are not fully documented, but this
   appendix should contain enough information to allow parsing Client
   Hellos for those versions.

   To extract the version number itself, one needs to look at the first
   byte of the QUIC packet, in other words the first byte of the UDP
   payload.
