Internet-Draft       Draft Information Requirements         January 2005


1.  Introduction

   Public Internet-Drafts are primary means of structured communication
   within IETF.  The information that IETF currently provides about any
   given draft is decentralized and often insufficient to facilitate
   on-going draft review and use by IETFers and 3rd parties.  The IETF
   Tools team recommends creation of a single, authoritative, and
   comprehensive IETF source for draft information.  This document
   specifies what information IETF should provide about a draft and, to
   a limited extent, how that information needs to be provided.

   Most, if not all, requirements in this document are inspired by
   existing sources of draft information, both on official IETF web
   sites and sites administered outside of IETF.

2.  State of this draft version

   This draft version does not contain much meat and cannot represent
   Tools team consensus.  Thus, this draft version is not meant for
   review.  However, the Tools team is interested in (a) high-level
   comments about what information needs to be provided by IETF and (b)
   pointers to existing sites providing useful draft information.
   Please post your comments on tools-discuss@ietf.org mailing list or
   email them directly to the author.

   RFC Editor Note: Please remove this section for the final publication
   of the document.  It has been inspired by
   draft-rousskov-newtrk-id-state and related NEWTRK WG discussions.

3.  Scope

   The document scope is a single Internet-Draft, including multiple
   versions and formats of the same draft.  Requirements cover
   submitted, posted, published, expired, and unknown personal or
   Working Group drafts.

   The interfaces required to locate a draft or correlate information
   about multiple drafts are out of scope.

4.  Notation and Terminology

   The following terms are to be interpreted according to their
   definitions below.

   posted draft: A draft accepted into public IETF draft repository and,
      hence, publicly available on IETF web site.  Posting of a draft
      does not imply any IETF or IESG review and endorsement.

Internet-Draft       Draft Information Requirements         January 2005


   draft version: A meant-to-be-public snapshot of an Internet-Draft
      with a meant-to-be-unique version number.  Also known as "draft
      revision".

   draft format: Any draft source or presentation format, including
      original and preprocessed XML, original or generated plain text as
      well as PDF, PostScript, and HTML formats.

   primary draft format: The first available draft format from the
      following list: plain text, PDF, PostScript, or XML.

   WG draft: A draft which identifier (a.k.a.  filename) is known and
      starts with "draft-ietf-".

   individual draft: A draft other than a WG draft.

   Normative requirements in this document are English phrases ending
   with an "(Rnnn/s)" mark, where "nnn" is a unique requirement number,
   and "s" is a single letter code ("a", "b", or "c") specifying the
   implementation stage for the requirement.  Implementation stages are
   documented in Section 8.

   This document does not specify how the implementation must obtain
   necessary draft information and does not require specific information
   rendering techniques.  However, implementation hints or examples are
   often useful.  To avoid mixup with normative requirements, such hints
   and examples are marked with a "Hint:" prefix.  Implementation hints
   do not carry any normative force, and a different implementation may
   be the best choice.

5.  Status quo

   This section summarizes what information about a draft is usually
   available to IETFers at the time of writing.

   TBD

6.  Requirements

   The following information should be available about a given draft:

   o  draft status (similar to what ID tracker does now)

   o  draft meta-data (XXX: expand)

   o  available draft versions

   o  change history (for drafts with multiple versions available)

Internet-Draft       Draft Information Requirements         January 2005


   o  "notify me when this draft changes" functionality

   For each available draft version, the following information should be
   provided:

   o  version meta-data (XXX: expand)

   o  primary version format (always available)

   o  all other available version formats (if any)


6.1  Draft metadata

   o  authors information

   o  WG name

   o  email address for draft discussion and comments

   o  "obsoletes X" or "renamed to Y" information

   All draft metadata must be available in format(s) suitable for human
   consumtion and in XML format.

6.2  Available draft versions

6.3  Change history

6.4  Notification functionality

6.5  Version metadata

6.6  Version formats

7.  Email interface

   TBD

8.  Implementation stages

   TBD.

9.  Security Considerations

   TBD.

10.  IANA Considerations

   None.

11.  Compliance

   TBD.

Appendix A.  Comparison with current procedures

   This section summarizes major differences between information
   currently provided by IETF and what is being proposed, including
   violations of the current IETF rules.

   o  Currently, IETF provides only the latest draft version.  This
      document requires providing all unexpired versions.  This change
      allows to maintain a change history useful for draft review and
      discussion.  The change does not seem to contradict written IETF
      rules and principles.  If an experiment with providing unexpired
      but obsolete versions does not cause significant problems, the
      IETF rules might be modified to also provide all draft versions
      for unexpired drafts and, later, all draft versions ever posted.
