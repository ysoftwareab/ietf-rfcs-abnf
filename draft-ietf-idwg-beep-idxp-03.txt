Abstract

   This memo describes the Intrusion Detection Exchange Protocol (IDXP),
   an application-level protocol for exchanging data between intrusion
   detection entities.  IDXP supports mutual-authentication, integrity,
   and confidentiality over a connection-oriented protocol.  The
   protocol provides for the exchange of IDMEF messages, unstructured
   text, and binary data.  The IDMEF message elements are described in
   the Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format (IDMEF) [3], a
   companion document of the Intrusion Detection Exchange Format (IDWG)

1. Introduction

   IDXP is specified, in part, as a Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol
   (BEEP) [7] "profile".  BEEP is a generic application protocol
   framework for connection-oriented, asynchronous interactions.
   Features such as authentication and confidentiality are provided
   through the use of other BEEP profiles.  Accordingly, many aspects of
   IDXP (e.g., confidentiality) are provided within the BEEP framework.


1.1 Purpose

   IDXP provides for the exchange of IDMEF [3] messages, unstructured
   text, and binary data between intrusion detection entities.
   Addressing the security-sensitive nature of exchanges between
   intrusion detection entities, underlying BEEP security profiles
   should be used to offer IDXP the required set of security properties.
   See Section 5 for a discussion of how IDXP fulfills the IDWG
   communication protocol requirements.  See Section 10 for a discussion
   of security considerations.

   IDXP is primarily intended for the exchange of data created by
   intrusion detection entities.  IDMEF [3] messages should be used for
   the structured representation of this intrusion detection data,
   although IDXP may be used to exchange unstructured text and binary
   data.


1.2 Profiles

   There are several BEEP profiles discussed, the first of which we
   define in this memo:

      The IDXP Profile

      The TUNNEL Profile [6]

      The Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) Family of
      Profiles (c.f., Section 4.1 of [7])

      The TLS Profile (c.f., Section 3.1 of [7])


1.3 Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].

Internet-Draft                  The IDXP                  September 2001


   Throughout this memo, the terms "analyzer" and "manager" are used in
   the context of the Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Requirements
   [8].  In particular, Section 3.2 of [8] defines the meaning of a
   collection of intrusion detection terms.

   The terms "peer", "initiator", "listener", "client", and "server" are
   used in the context of BEEP [7].  In particular, Section 2.1 of the
   BEEP framework memo discusses the roles that a BEEP peer may perform.

   Note that the term "proxy" is specific to IDXP, and does not exist in
   the context of BEEP.  The term "intrusion detection" is abbreviated
   as "ID".

2. The Model

2.1 Connection Provisioning

   Intrusion detection entities using IDXP to transfer data are termed
   IDXP peers.  Peers can exist only in pairs, and these pairs
   communicate over a single BEEP session with one or more BEEP channels
   opened for transferring data.  Peers are either managers or
   analyzers, as defined in Section 3.2 of [8].

   The relationship between analyzers and managers is potentially many-
   to-many.  I.e., an analyzer MAY communicate with many managers;
   similarly, a manager MAY communicate with many analyzers.  Likewise,
   the relationship between different managers is potentially many-to-
   many, so that a manager MAY receive the alerts sent by a large number
   of analyzers by receiving them through intermediate managers.
   Analyzers MUST NOT establish IDXP exchanges with other analyzers.

   An ID entity wishing to establish IDXP communications with another ID
   entity does so by opening a BEEP channel, which may entail initiating
   a BEEP session.  A BEEP security profile offering the required
   security properties SHOULD initially be negotiated (see Section 10
   for a discussion of security considerations).  Following the
   successful negotiation of the BEEP security profile, IDXP greetings
   are exchanged and connection provisioning proceeds.

   In the following sequence an ID entity 'Alice' initiates an IDXP
   exchange with the entity 'Bob'.

        Alice                                               Bob
          ---------------- xport connect[1] ------------------>
         <-------------------- greeting ---------------------->
         <-------------start security profile[2] ------------->
         <-------------------- greeting ---------------------->
         <------------------ start IDXP[3] ------------------->

   Notes:

      [1] 'Alice' initiates a transport connection to 'Bob', triggering
         the exchange of BEEP greeting messages.

      [2] both entities negotiate the use of a BEEP security profile.

      [3] both entities negotiate the use of the IDXP profile.

   In between a pair of IDXP peers may be an arbitrary number of
   proxies.  A proxy may be necessary for administrative reasons, such
   as running on a firewall to allow restricted access.  Another use

   might be one proxy per company department, which forwards data from
   the analyzer peers in the department onto a company-wide manager
   peer.

   A BEEP tuning profile MAY be used to create an application-layer
   tunnel that transparently forwards data over a chain of proxies.  The
   TUNNEL profile [6] SHOULD be used for this purpose; see [6] for more
   detail concerning the options available to setup an application-layer
   tunnel using TUNNEL, and see Section 10.1 for a discussion of TUNNEL
   related security considerations.  TUNNEL MUST be offered as a tuning
   profile for the creation of application-layer tunnels.  The TUNNEL
   profile MUST offer the use of some form of SASL authentication (c.f.,
   Section 4.1 of [7]).  Once a tunnel has been created a BEEP security
   profile offering the required security properties SHOULD be
   negotiated, followed by negotiation of the IDXP profile.

   The following sequence shows how TUNNEL might be used to create an
   application-layer tunnel through which IDXP would operate.  An ID
   entity 'Alice' initiates the creation of a BEEP session using the
   IDXP profile with the entity 'Bob' by first contacting 'proxy1'.  In
   the greeting exchange between 'Alice' and 'proxy1', the TUNNEL
   profile is selected, and subsequently the use of the TUNNEL profile
   is extended to reach through 'proxy2' to 'Bob'.

   Alice              proxy1               proxy2               Bob
     -- xport connect -->
    <---- greeting ----->
     -- start TUNNEL --->
                         - xport connect[1] ->
                        <----- greeting ----->
                         --- start TUNNEL --->
                                              --- xport connect -->
                                             <----- greeting ----->
                                              --- start TUNNEL --->
                                             <----- <ok>[2] ------
                        <------- <ok> -------
    <------ <ok> -------
    <------------------------- greeting -------------------------->
    <------------------ start security profile ------------------->
    <------------------------- greeting -------------------------->
    <------------------------ start IDXP ------------------------->

   Notes:

      [1] Instead of immediately acknowledging the request from 'Alice'
         to start TUNNEL, 'proxy1' attempts to establish use of TUNNEL
         with 'proxy2'.  'proxy2' also delays its acknowledgment to
         'proxy1'.

Internet-Draft                  The IDXP                  September 2001


      [2] 'Bob' acknowledges the request from 'proxy2' to start TUNNEL,
         and this acknowledgment propagates back to 'Alice' so that a
         TUNNEL application-layer tunnel is established from 'Alice' to
         'Bob'.


2.2 Data Transfer

   Between a pair of ID entities communicating over a BEEP session, one
   or more BEEP channels MAY be opened using the IDXP profile.  If
   desired, additional BEEP sessions MAY be established to offer
   additional channels using the IDXP profile.  However, in most
   situations additional channels using the IDXP profile SHOULD be
   opened within an existing BEEP session, as opposed to provisioning a
   new BEEP session containing the additional channels using the IDXP
   profile.

   Peers assume the role of client or server on a per-channel basis,
   with one acting as the client and the other as the server.  A peer's
   role of client or server is determined independent of whether the
   peer assumed the role of initiator or listener during the BEEP
   session establishment.  Clients and servers act as sources and sinks,
   respectively, for exchanging data.

   In a simple case, an analyzer peer sends data to a manager peer.
   E.g.,

           +----------+                          +----------+
           |          |                          |          |
           |          |****** BEEP session ******|          |
           |          |                          |          |
           | Analyzer | ----- IDXP profile ----> | Manager  |
           | (Client) |                          | (Server) |
           |          |                          |          |
           |          |**************************|          |
           |          |                          |          |
           +----------+                          +----------+

   Use of multiple BEEP channels in a BEEP session facilitates
   categorization and prioritization of data sent between IDXP peers.
   For example, a manager 'M1', sending alert data to another manager,
   'M2', may choose to open a separate channel to exchange different
   categories of alerts.  'M1' would act as the client on each of these
   channels, and manager 'M2' can then process and act on the incoming
   alerts based on their respective channel categorizations.  See
   Section 4 for more detail on how to incorporate categorization and/or
   prioritization into channel creation.

2.3 Connection Teardown

   An IDXP peer may choose to close an IDXP channel under many different
   circumstances (e.g., an error in processing has occurred).  To close
   a channel, the peer sends a "close" element (c.f., Section 2.3.1.3 of
   [7]) on channel zero indicating which channel is being closed.  An
   IDXP peer may also choose to close an entire BEEP session by sending
   a "close" element indicating that channel zero is to be closed.
   Section 2.3.1.3 of [7] offers a more complete discussion of the
   circumstances under which a BEEP peer is permitted to close a channel
   and the mechanisms for doing so.

   It is anticipated that due to the overhead of provisioning an
   application-layer tunnel and/or a BEEP security profile, BEEP
   sessions containing IDXP channels will be long-lived.  Additionally,
   the repeated overhead of IDXP channel provisioning (i.e., the
   exchange of IDXP greetings) may be avoided by keeping IDXP channels
   open even while data is not actively being exchanged on them.  These
   are recommendations and, as such, IDXP peers may choose to close and
   re-provision BEEP sessions and/or IDXP channels as they see fit.

2.4 Trust Model

   In our model, trust is placed exclusively in the IDXP peers.  Proxies
   are always assumed to be untrustworthy.  A BEEP security profile is
   used to establish end-to-end security between pairs of IDXP peers,
   doing away with the need to place trust in any intervening proxies.
   Only after successful negotiation of the underlying security profile
   are IDXP peers to be trusted.  Only BEEP security profiles offering
   at least the protections required by Section 6 of [8] should be used
   to secure a BEEP session containing channels using the IDXP profile.
   See Section 3 of [7] for the registration of the TLS profile, an
   example of a BEEP security profile meeting the requirements of

3. The IDXP Profile

3.1 IDXP Profile Overview

   The IDXP profile provides a mechanism for exchanging information
   between intrusion detection entities.  A BEEP tuning profile MAY be
   used to create an application-layer tunnel that transparently
   forwards data over a chain of proxies.  The TUNNEL profile [6] SHOULD
   be used for this purpose; see [6] for more detail concerning the
   options available to setup an application-layer tunnel using TUNNEL,
   and see Section 10.1 for a discussion of TUNNEL related security
   considerations.  TUNNEL MUST be offered as a tuning profile for the
   creation of application-layer tunnels.  The TUNNEL profile MUST offer
   the use of some form of SASL authentication (c.f., Section 4.1 of
   [7]).  The TLS profile SHOULD be used to provide the required
   combination of mutual-authentication, integrity, and confidentiality
   for the IDXP profile.  For further discussion of application-layer
   tunnel and security issues see Section 2.1 and Section 10.

   The IDXP profile supports several elements of interest:

   o  The "IDXP-Greeting" element identifies an analyzer or manager at
      one end of a BEEP channel to the analyzer or manager at the other
      end of the channel.

   o  The "Option" element is used to convey optional channel parameters
      between peers during the exchange of "IDXP-Greeting" elements.
      This element is OPTIONAL.

   o  The "IDMEF-Message" element carries the structured information to
      be exchanged between the peers.


3.2 IDXP Profile Identification and Initialization

   The IDXP profile is identified as

      http://iana.org/beep/transient/idwg/idxp

   in the BEEP "profile" element during channel creation.

   During channel creation, "IDXP-Greeting" elements MUST be mutually
   exchanged between the peers.  An "IDXP-Greeting" element MAY be
   contained within the corresponding "profile" element in the BEEP
   "start" element.  Including an "IDXP-Greeting" element in the initial
   "start" element has exactly the same semantics as passing it as the
   first "MSG" message on the channel.  If channel creation is
   successful, then before sending the corresponding reply, the BEEP

Internet-Draft                  The IDXP                  September 2001


   peer processes the "IDXP-Greeting" element and includes the resulting
   response in the reply.  This response will be an "ok" element or an
   "error" element.  The choice of which element is returned is
   dependent on local provisioning of the peer.


3.3 IDXP Profile Message Syntax

   BEEP messages in the profile MUST have a MIME Content-Type [4] of
   "text/xml", "text/plain", or "application/octet-stream".  The syntax
   of the individual elements is specified in Section 8.1 and Section 5
   of [3].


3.4 IDXP Profile Semantics

   Each BEEP peer issues the "IDXP-Greeting" element using "MSG"
   messages.  The "IDXP-Greeting" element MAY contain one or more
   "Option" sub-elements, conveying optional channel parameters.  Each
   BEEP peer then issues "ok" in "RPY" messages or "error" in "ERR"
   messages.  (See Section 2.3.1 of [7] for the definitions of the
   "error" and "ok" elements.) Based on the respective client/server
   roles negotiated during the exchange of "IDXP-Greeting" elements, the
   client sends data using "MSG" messages.  Depending on the MIME
   Content-Type, this data may be an "IDMEF-Message" element, plain
   text, or binary.  The server then issues "ok" in "RPY" messages or
   "error" in "ERR" messages.


3.4.1 The IDXP-GREETING Element

   The "IDXP-Greeting" element serves to identify the analyzer or
   manager at one end of the BEEP channel to the analyzer or manager at
   the other end of the channel.  The "IDXP-Greeting" element MUST
   include the role of the peer on the channel (client or server) and
   the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) [1] of the peer.  Additionally,
   the "IDXP-Greeting" element MAY include a combination of the fully
   qualified domain name (c.f., [5]) and IP address of the peer.  The IP
   address chosen SHOULD correspond to the IP address associated with
   the underlying transport protocol carrying the channel.  One or more
   "Option" sub-elements MAY be present.

   An "IDXP-Greeting" element MAY be sent by either peer at any time.
   The peer receiving the "IDXP-Greeting" MUST respond with an "ok"
   (indicating acceptance), or an "error" (indicating rejection).  A
   peer's identity and role on a channel and any optional channel
   parameters are, in effect, specified by the most recent "IDXP-
   Greeting" it sent that was answered with an "ok".

Internet-Draft                  The IDXP                  September 2001


   An "IDXP-Greeting" may be rejected (with an "error" element) under
   many circumstances.  These include, but are not limited to,
   authentication failure, lack of authorization to connect under the
   specified role, the negotiation of an inadequate ciphersuite, or the
   presence of a channel option that must be understood but was
   unrecognized.

   For example, a successful creation with an embedded "IDXP-Greeting"
   might look like this:

3.4.2 The OPTION Element

   If present, the "Option" element MUST be contained within an "IDXP-
   Greeting" element.  An individual "IDXP-Greeting" element MAY contain
   one or more "Option" sub-elements.  Each "Option" element within an
   "IDXP-Greeting" element represents a request to enable an IDXP option
   on the channel being negotiated.  See Section 4 for a complete
   description of IDXP options and the "Option" element.


3.4.3 The IDMEF-MESSAGE Element

   The "IDMEF-Message" element carries the information to be exchanged
   between the peers.  See Section 5 of [3] for the definition of this
   element.

4. IDXP Options

   IDXP provides a service for the reliable exchange of data between
   intrusion detection entities.  Options are used to alter the
   semantics of the service.

   The specification of an IDXP option MUST define:

   o  the identity of the option;

   o  what content, if any, is contained within the option; and,

   o  the processing rules for the option.

   An option registration template (c.f.  Section 6) organizes this
   information.

   An "Option" element is contained within an "IDXP-Greeting" element.
   The "IDXP-Greeting" element itself MAY contain one or more "Option"
   elements.  The "Option" element has several attributes and contains
   arbitrary content:

   o  the "internal" and the "external" attributes, exactly one of which
      MUST be present, uniquely identify the option;

   o  the "mustUnderstand" attribute, whose presence is OPTIONAL and
      whose default value is "false", specifies whether the option, if
      unrecognized, MUST cause an error in processing to occur; and,

   o  the "localize" attribute, whose presence is OPTIONAL, specifies
      one or more language tokens, each identifying a desirable language
      tag to be used if textual diagnostics are returned to the
      originator.

   The value of the "internal" attribute is the IANA-registered name for
   the option.  If the "internal" attribute is not present, then the
   value of the "external" attribute is a URI or URI with a fragment-
   identifier.  Note that a relative-URI value is not allowed.

   The "mustUnderstand" attribute specifies whether the peer may ignore
   the option if it is unrecognized.  If the value of the
   "mustUnderstand" attribute is "true", and if the peer does not
   recognize the option, then an error in processing has occurred.  When
   absent, the value of the "mustUnderstand" attribute is defined to be
   "false".

4.1 The channelPriority Option

   Section 7.3 contains the IDXP option registration for the
   "channelPriority" option.  This option contains a "channelPriority"
   element (c.f., Section 8.2).

   By default, IDXP does not place any requirements on how peers should
   manage multiple IDXP channels.  The "channelPriority" option provides
   a way for peers using multiple IDXP channels to request relative
   priorities for each channel.  When sending an "IDXP-Greeting" element
   during the provisioning of an IDXP channel, the originating peer MAY
   request that the remote peer assign a priority to the channel by
   including an "Option" element containing a "channelPriority" element.

   The "channelPriority" element has one attribute named "priority", of
   range 0..2147483647.  This attribute is REQUIRED.  Not
   coincidentally, this is the maximum range of possible BEEP channel
   numbers.  0 is defined to represent the highest priority, with
   relative priority decreasing as the "priority" value ascends.

   For example, during the exchange of "IDXP-Greeting" elements during
   channel provisioning, an analyzer successfully requests that a
   manager assign a priority to the channel:


       analyzer                                           manager
          --------------- greeting w/ option ----------------->

   C:

   C: END


4.2 The streamType Option

   Section 7.4 contains the IDXP option registration for the
   "streamType" option.  This option contains a "streamType" element
   (c.f., Section 8.3).

   By default, IDXP provides no explicit method for categorizing
   channels.  The "streamType" option provides a way for peers to
   request that a channel be categorized as a particular stream type.
   When sending an "IDXP-Greeting" element during the provisioning of an
   IDXP channel, the originating peer MAY request that the remote peer
   assign a stream type to the channel by including an "Option" element
   containing a "streamType" element.

   The "streamType" element has one attribute named "type", with the
   possible values of "alert", "heartbeat", or "config".  This attribute
   is REQUIRED.  A value of "alert" indicates that the channel should be
   categorized as being used for the exchange of ID alerts.  A value of
   "heartbeat" indicates that the channel should be categorized as being
   used for the exchange of heartbeat messages such as the "Heartbeat"
   element (c.f., Section 5 of [3]).  A value of "config" indicates that
   the channel should be categorized as being used for the exchange of
   configuration messages.

5. Fulfillment of IDWG Communications Protocol Requirements

   The following lists the communications protocol requirements
   established in Section 6 of [8] and, for each requirement, describes
   the manner in which it is fulfilled by IDXP.

   o  The [protocol] MUST support reliable transmission of messages.

         IDXP operates over BEEP, which operates only over reliable
         connection-oriented transport protocols (e.g., TCP).  In
         addition, BEEP peers communicate using a simple request-
         response protocol, which provides end-to-end reliability
         between peers.

   o  The [protocol] MUST support transmission of messages between ID
      components across firewall boundaries without compromising
      security.

         The TUNNEL profile [6] MUST be offered as an option for
         creation of application-layer tunnels to allow operation across
         firewalls.  The TUNNEL profile SHOULD be used to provide an
         application-layer tunnel.  The ability to authenticate hosts
         during the creation of an application-layer tunnel MUST be
         provided by the mechanism chosen to create such tunnels.  A
         firewall may therefore be configured to authenticate all hosts
         attempting to tunnel into the protected network.  If the TUNNEL
         profile is used, SASL (c.f., Section 4.1 of [7]) MUST be
         offered as a mechanism by which hosts can be authenticated.

   o  The [protocol] MUST support mutual authentication of the analyzer
      and the manager to each other.

         IDXP supports mutual authentication of the peers through the
         use of an appropriate underlying BEEP security profile.  The
         TLS profile and members of the SASL family of profiles (c.f.,
         Section 4.1 of [7]) are examples of security profiles that may
         be used to authenticate the identity of communicating ID
         components.  TLS MUST be offered as a mechanism to provide
         mutual authentication, and TLS SHOULD be used to provide mutual
         authentication.

   o  The [protocol] MUST support confidentiality of the message content
      during message exchange.  The selected design MUST be capable of
      supporting a variety of encryption algorithms and MUST be
      adaptable to a wide variety of environments.

         IDXP supports confidentiality through the use of an appropriate
         underlying BEEP security profile.  The TLS profile is an

Internet-Draft                  The IDXP                  September 2001


         example a security profile that offers confidentiality.  The
         TLS profile with the TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA cipher
         suite MUST be offered as a mechanism to provide
         confidentiality, and TLS with this cipher suite SHOULD be used
         to provide confidentiality.  The
         TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA cipher suite uses ephemeral
         Diffie-Hellman (DHE) with DSS signatures for key exchange and
         triple DES (3DES) and cipher-block chaining (CBC) for
         encryption.  Stronger cipher suites are optional.

   o  The [protocol] MUST ensure the integrity of the message content.
      The selected design MUST be capable of supporting a variety of
      integrity mechanisms and MUST be adaptable to a wide variety of
      environments.

         IDXP supports message integrity through the use of an
         appropriate underlying BEEP security profile.  The TLS profile
         and members of the SASL family of profiles (c.f., Section 4.1
         of [7]) are examples of security profiles that offer message
         integrity.  The TLS profile with the
         TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA cipher suite MUST be offered
         as a mechanism to provide integrity, and TLS with this cipher
         suite SHOULD be used to provide integrity.  The
         TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA cipher suite uses the Secure
         Hash Algorithm (SHA) for integrity protection using a keyed
         message authentication code.  Stronger cipher suites are
         optional.

   o  The [protocol] SHOULD be able to ensure non-repudiation of the
      origin of IDMEF messages.

         IDXP supports non-repudiation of message origin through the use
         of an appropriate underlying BEEP security profile.  The TLS
         profile is an example of a security profile that offers non-
         repudiation of message origin through the authentication of
         public-key certificates.  TLS MUST be offered as a mechanism to
         provide non-repudiation of message origin, and TLS SHOULD be
         used to provide non-repudiation of message origin.

   o  The [protocol] SHOULD resist protocol denial of service attacks.

         IDXP supports resistance to denial of service (DoS) attacks
         through the use of an appropriate underlying BEEP security
         profile.  BEEP peers offering the IDXP profile MUST offer the
         use of TLS with the TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA cipher
         suite, and SHOULD use TLS with that cipher suite.  To resist
         DoS attacks it is helpful to discard traffic arising from a
         non-authenticated source.  BEEP peers MUST support the use of

         authentication in conjunction with any mechanism used to create
         application-layer tunnels.  In particular, the use of some form
         of SASL authentication (c.f., Section 4.1 of [7]) MUST be
         offered to provide authentication in the use of the TUNNEL
         profile.  See Section 7 of [6] for a discussion of security
         considerations in the use of the TUNNEL profile.

   o  The [protocol] SHOULD resist malicious duplication of messages.

         IDXP supports resistance to malicious duplication of messages
         (i.e., replay attacks) through the use of an appropriate
         underlying BEEP security profile.  The TLS profile is an
         example of a security profile offering resistance to replay
         attacks.  The TLS profile with the
         TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA cipher suite MUST be offered
         as a mechanism to provide resistance against replay attacks,
         and TLS with this cipher suite SHOULD be used to provide
         resistance against replay attacks.  The
         TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA cipher suite uses cipher-
         block chaining (CBC) to ensure that even if a message is
         duplicated the cipher-text duplicate will produce a very
         different plain-text result.  Stronger cipher suites are
         optional.

10. Security Considerations

   The IDXP profile is a profile of BEEP.  In BEEP, transport security,
   user authentication, and data exchange are orthogonal.  Refer to
   Section 8 of [7] for a discussion of this.  It is strongly
   recommended that those wanting to use the IDXP profile initially
   negotiate a BEEP security profile between the peers that offers the
   required security properties.  The TLS profile SHOULD be used to
   provide for transport security.  See Section 5 for a discussion of
   how IDXP fulfills the IDWG communications protocol requirements.

   See Section 2.4 for a discussion of the trust model.


10.1 Use of the TUNNEL Profile

   See Section 5 for IDXP's requirements on application-layer tunneling
   and the TUNNEL profile specifically.  See Section 7 of [6] for a
   discussion of the security considerations inherent in the use of the
   TUNNEL profile.


10.2 Use of Underlying Security Profiles

   At present, the TLS profile is the only BEEP security profile known
   to meet all of the requirements set forth in Section 6 of [8].  When
   securing a BEEP session with the TLS profile, the
   TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA cipher suite offers an acceptable
   level of security.  See Section 5 for a discussion of how IDXP
   fulfills the IDWG communications requirements through the use of an
   underlying security profile.

Appendix A. IANA Considerations

   The IANA registers "IDXP" as a standards-track BEEP profile, as
   specified in Section 7.1.  The IANA changes the IDXP profile
   identification to "http://iana.org/beep/IDXP".

   The IANA registers "idxp" as a TCP port number, as specified in
   Section 7.2

   The IANA maintains a list of:

   o  IDXP options, c.f., Section 6.

   For this list, the IESG is responsible for assigning a designated
   expert to review the specification prior to the IANA making the
   assignment.  As a courtesy to developers of non-standards track IDXP
   options, the mailing list idxp-java-users@lists.sourceforge.net may
   be used to solicit commentary.

   The IANA makes the registrations specified in Section 7.3 and Section
   7.4.

Appendix B. History of Significant Changes

   The RFC Editor should remove this section and its corresponding TOC
   references prior to publication.

B.1 Significant Changes Since beep-idxp-02

   Added IDXP option registration template and registered two initial
   options.

   Indicated that the IANA should change the profile identification to
   "http://iana.org/beep/IDXP" upon adoption of IDXP as a standards-
   track BEEP profile.

   Renamed the "Options" element to "Option" and allowed multiple
   "Option" sub-elements within an "IDXP-Greeting" element.  Also added
   attributes to "Option" element.

   Modified IANA profile registration and added TCP port number IANA
   registration.

   Reordered some sections to improve the flow of the document.

   Changed IDXP DTD identifier to be more IETF-like and removed URLs
   from ENTITY declarations.

   Changed IDXP profile URI to fall under the
   "http://iana.org/beep/transient" namespace.

   Modified Section 1.3 to reference the requirements language specified
   by [2].

   Eliminated the use of the "endpoint" terminology, in favor of "peer".

   Modified figures to make them more understandable.

   Modified Sections 2, 3, and 4 to use the requirements language
   specified by [2].

   Indicated that the RFC Editor should remove Appendix B and its
   corresponding TOC reference prior to publication.

   Fixed several typos.
