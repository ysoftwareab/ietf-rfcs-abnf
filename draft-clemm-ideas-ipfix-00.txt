1.  Introduction

   This document defines a set of new Information Elements to be used in
   conjunction with the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) protocol
   [RFC7011].  The new Information Elements are intended to be used in
   Identity-Enabled Networks [IDEAS-PS], in which communication flows
   between Entities contain identifiers that reference the Identities of
   Entities that participate in the flow, in addition to or in lieu of
   addresses that tie Entities to a specific location.

   To use IPFIX in the context of Identity-Enabled Networks, extensions
   are needed to denote the identifiers of sources and destinations in a
   flow.  Those identifiers are generally distinct from e.g. an IP
   addresses, which are commonly included in flow records today.

   In addition to Information Elements to capture Identifiers of
   communicating Entities, this document also defines a Information
   Elements that contain metadata about communicating Entities.  An
   example of such metadata is an Entity's type, for example, whether
   the Entity represents a mobile phone, a connected vehicle, an IoT
   lightbulb, or an Automated Teller Machine.  It is anticipated that
   metadata will play an important role in Identity-Enabled Networks.
   However, in principle, Information Elements that capture metadata

   could be applied in other contexts and other types of networks as
   well.

2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Definition of Terms

      Entity: An entity is a communication endpoint.  It can be a
      device, a node, or a (software) process, that needs to be
      identified.  An entity may have one or multiple Identifiers
      simultaneously.  An entity is reached by the resolution of one or
      more of its Identifiers to one or more Locators.

      Identifier (IDf): An IDf denotes information to unambiguously
      identify an entity within a given scope.  There is no constraint
      on the format, obfuscation or routability of an IDf.  The IDf may
      or may not be present in the packet whose format is defined by
      Identifier-based protocols.

      Identity: the essence of "being" of a specific entity.  An
      Identity is not to be confused with an Identifier: while an
      Identifier may be used to refer to an entity, an Identifier's
      lifecycle is not necessarily tied to the lifecycle of the Identity
      it is referencing.  On the other hand, the Identity's lifecycle is
      inherently tied to the lifecycle of the entity itself.

      IDentity Enabled Networks (IDEAS): IDEAS are networks that support
      the Identifier/Locator decoupling.  Reaching an entity is achieved
      by the resolution of Identifier(s) to Locator(s).

      Information Element (IE): An Information Element is a protocol-
      and encoding-independent description of an attribute that may
      appear in an IPFIX Record.  Information Elements are defined in
      the IANA "IPFIX Information Elements" registry [IANA-IPFIX].  The
      type associated with an Information Element indicates constraints
      on what it may contain and also determines the valid encoding
      mechanisms for use in IPFIX.

      IP Flow Information Export (IFFIX): A technology used to export
      data about flow records, specified in a series of standards that
      are anchored by [RFC7011].

      IPFIX Collector: A device that hosts a process which receives
      IPFIX Messages from one or more IPFIX Devices.

      IPFIX Device: An IPFIX Device is a device that hosts at least one
      process that exports IPFIX records.

      Metadata: Metadata is data about an Identity.  The metadata may
      contain information such as the nature of the entity for example.

4.  Information Elements

4.1.  Identifiers

   In this section, Information Elements are defined for Identifiers of
   16 or 4 octets length.  It is TBD whether additional Information
   Elements need to be defined for variable length Identifiers or for
   Identifiers of different length.  It should be noted that variable
   and long length Identifiers can also be accommodated by Identifier
   Hashes, as defined in Section 4.2.

4.1.1.  sourceId16

   This Information Element specifies the Source IDf, i.e. the
   identifier of the source of the flow, in cases where the source's IDf
   uses 16 octets.  The Information Element uses 16 octets and is of
   type octetArray.

4.1.2.  sourceId4

   This Information Element specifies the Source IDf, i.e. the
   identifier of the source of the flow, in cases where the source's ID
   uses 4 octets.  The Information Element uses 4 octets and is of type
   octetArray.

4.1.3.  destinationId16

   This Information Element specifies the Destination IDf, i.e. the
   identifier of the destination of the flow, in cases where the
   destination's IDf uses 16 octets.  The Information Element uses 16
   octets and is of type octetArray.

4.1.4.  destinationId4

   This Information Element specifies the Source IDf, i.e. the
   identifier of the source of the flow, in cases where the source's IDf
   uses 4 octets.  The Information Element uses 4 octets and is of type
   octetArray.

4.2.  Identifier Hashes

   Carrying a hash of an Identifier, instead of an Identifier itself,
   provides an additional measure of privacy and information security.
   It also allows for more compact identification of sources and
   destinations in the case of Identifiers of long length and/or
   variable length.

   Which hash function an IPFIX Exporter should apply is subject to
   configuration and not specified further in this document.

   For an IPFIX Collector to associate a hash with an actual Identifier,
   it needs to be able to resolve which hash is associated with which
   Identifier.  There are different ways in which such resolution can be
   performed.  One possibility is for the IPFIX Device to export a table
   containing Identifiers and Hashes, containing entries for Identifiers
   who have had associated flow records recently exported.

   It is TBD whether additional hash lengths should be supported.

4.2.1.  sourceIdHash

   This Information Element specifies a hash of the identifier of the
   source of the flow.  The Information Element uses 4 octets and is of
   type octetArray.

4.2.2.  destinationIdHash

   This Information Element specifies a hash of the identifier of the
   destination of the flow.  The Information Element uses 4 octets and
   is of type octetArray.

4.3.  Metadata

   Metadata contains information about Entities that are involved in a
   communications flow.  There are different ways in which metadata
   could be inferred.  In some cases, metadata may be evident by the
   structure of the Entity's identifier.  In other cases, there may be
   additional functions that allow to look up an Entity's metadata.

   At this point, the only metadata that is deemed interesting to
   include in flow records concerns the type of the entity, although it
   is conceivable that additional types of metadata might be added in
   the future.  It should also be noted that it is conceivable to have a
   hierarchy of types, in which specialized types are subtypes of a more
   general type.  In such a case, type information SHOULD be populated
   with the most specific type.

   The type of the entity is encoded using 4 octets as follows:

   o  bit 0: Standard or enterprise-specific type with the following
      values:

      *  0: standard

      *  1: enterprise-specific

   o  bits 1 through 19: In case of enterprise-specific type, enterprise
      number per IANA's Enterprise Numbers registry, binary encoded,
      with leading 0's.  In case of standard type, ignored.  Note: it is
      anticipated that 19 bits will suffice to encode enterprise numbers
      for the foreseeable future.

   o  bits 20 through 31: Type number, binary encoded, with leading 0's,
      per newly introduced IANA registry for Type Numbers.  Please refer
      to section "IANA Considerations".

   A value of "0" indicates that the type is not specified.

4.3.1.  sourceIdType

   This Information Element specifies the type of the source of the
   flow.  This Information element uses 4 octets and is of type
   octetArray, encoded as described.

4.3.2.  destinationIdType

   This Information Element specifies the type of the destination of the
   flow.  This Information Element uses 4 octets and is of type
   octetArray, encoded as described.

5.  Security Considerations

   The recommendations in this document do not introduce additional
   security issues beyond those already specified in [RFC7011].  That
   said, it should be noted that flow records that carry Identifiers do
   contain sensitive information that allows to identify Entities that
   are engaged in communication flows and their communication patterns.
   By opting to use Identifier hashes, instead of Identifiers
   themselves, an additional measure of data protection can be provided.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add the Information Elements described above
   (Section 4) to IANA's registry of Information Elements [IANA-IPFIX]

   and assign corresponding Information Element IDs.  Currently,
   unassigned Information Element IDs start at 463.

   o  sourceId4

   o  destinationId4

   o  sourceId16

   o  destinationId16

   o  sourceIdHash

   o  destinationIdHash

   o  sourceIdType

   o  destinationIdType

   IANA is requested to create a new registry for Identity Types and
   register the following initial values:

   o  0: Not specified

   o  1: Other

   o  2: Server

   o  3: Mobile Device
