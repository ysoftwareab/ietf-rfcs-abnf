      Abstract 
          
         Link hints are going to be standardized to enhance interactions 
         between link and network layers, allowing a given node to integrate 
         and efficiently manage one or even several network interfaces.  
         Parameters conveyed in Link Hints shall provide the necessary 
         abstraction level to be mapped on several technologies.  This 
         document provides a first list of parameters to be transported in 
         Link Hints but the way to transport them is out of the scope of  
         this document. 
         Two sets of parameters are proposed: the MN set gathers information 
         available at the Mobile Node whereas the AR set is relevant for the 
         Access Router side. In each set, parameters are grouped into three 
         distinct categories: static parameters are related to the hardware 
         implementation of the interface, configuration parameters are 
         manageable through interface configuration, status parameters are 
         highly varying as they provide the current link environment of the 
         interface.

      1. Introduction 
          
         Due to the developpment of new protocols to manage host mobility 
         [1][2][3][4], Link hints are going to be standardized to enhance 
         interaction between the link layer and the network layer. This 
         interaction would allow to optimize network layer operations 
         (anticipation, choice of the attachment point, new link detectionà).  
         Link hints are expected to provide notifications when changes occur 
         in link environment such as the detection of a new point of 
         attachment, or the start/end of a handover procedure for a MN, or the 
         new attachment of a MN for an AP. As Mobile Nodes are able to 
         integrate several link layer interfaces with heterogeneous 
         technologies, it is expected in the near future that link hints will 
         provide the necessary framework to efficiently manage several 
         interfaces in a given Mobile Node. At the network side, a stronger 
         interaction between layers 2 and 3 would allow a better host mobility 
         control from the network. Hence, it becomes necessary to define 
         information elements to be transported in Link Hints and having the 
         necessary abstraction level to be mapped on several technologies.   
          
         The goal of this document is to define a list of link layer 
         parameters to be transported in link hints. It assumes that link 
         hints will be implemented in both sides of the link: in the Mobile 
         Node (MN) between the link layer module and the MN IP layer; in the 
         network side between the radio Access Point (AP) or Base Station (BS) 
         and the Access Router (AR). The way hints transport parameters 
         between the link and the network layer, either in the MN or in the 
         AR, is out of the scope of this document. This document is intended 
         to serve as a basis for discussions in the Detecting Network

      Internet Draft         Parameters for Link Hints            August 2003 
                                           
                                           
         Attachment (DNA) group and does not intend to be fully exhaustive. In 
         particular, it shall be refined accordingly to hints identified for 
         each link layer technology considered in the working group. 
          
         Section 3 introduces notions of parameters sets and categories; 
         section 4 and 5 defines parameters relevant at the MN and AR side 
         respectively.  In Annex A, tables illustrate examples on how 
         parameters can be used with different technologies (802.11, 
         Bluetooth, GPRS).  
          
          
      2. Conventions used in this document 
          
         The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
         "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
         document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1]. 
          
          
      3. Parameters sets and categories 
          
         Two sets of parameters are defined: the MN set contains parameters 
         made available by the MN link layer to the MN IP layer; the AR set 
         comprises parameters made available by the AR radio interface (or AP) 
         to the AR IP layer.  
          
         In each set (MN and AR sets), parameters are classified into three 
         categories: static parameters, configuration parameters and link 
         status parameters.  Static parameters refer to physical parameters 
         depending on the interface nature (such as the technology, the 
         hardware MAC addressà), their values are static. Configuration 
         parameters are defined through configuration of the link layer (e.g. 
         network name, security levelà), their values are dynamic but the 
         frequency of change is very low as it occurs on changes in 
         configuration that may be managed for example by the network 
         administrator or the user.  Link status parameters characterise the 
         current communication environment (e.g. available bandwidth, current 
         load, radio quality measurementà), their values are dynamic and 
         subject to frequent changes as radio link quality is highly variable 
         especially in mobile environments. 
          
         Link status parameters are also divided into two subsets: the first 
         subset contains parameters available locally to the link layer 
         interface whereas the second one contains parameters learnt from the 
         peer entity (either the MN or the AR/AP) at L2. 
          
         Depending on the link layer technology and its configuration, only a 
         subset of the listed parameters will be available in a given MN or 
         AR.  By default, each parameter must be set to NULL.

      4. MN parameters set 
          
         This section lists parameters available at the MN side, grouped by 
         categories. For examples on how to use these parameters with 
         different technologies, please refer to annex A.

              The complete set of technologies and the corresponding are to be 
              defined. It has to be noted that some links support more than 
              one technology; this is for example the case of dual-mode radio 
              cards. Hence, a given interface can be able to provide more than 
              one interface type to the network layer.

              This parameter indicates the fragmentation threshold of the L2 
              interface, i.e. the maximum size of MTU in L2 frames. 
          
         MN data rate 
              The MN data rate indicates the configured rate to be used for 
              the interface. Depending on the Interface type and its 
              configuration, either one or several data rate can be permitted.

                  give information on the current MN capabilities; 
               .  MN available attachments status sub-category includes 
                  parameters that are learned from the available point of

      5. AR parameters set 
       
         As already introduced, some parameters are common to MN and AR sets. 
         In the following, we list parameters available at the AR side with 
         reference to the ones described in the previous section for common 
         parameters or with more detailed description for parameters relevant 
         at the AR side only.  
         Any AR may control one or several link-layer interfaces integrated in 
         the AR such as hardware interfaces or remotely available through APs 
         connected to a fixed AR. The connection between APs and AR can use a 
         LAN (that is a typical deployment case for 802.11 networks) or 
         specific architecture and protocols such as a dedicated cellular 
         access network (that is the case for GPRS). Depending on the 
         connection types and protocols between APs and AR, only a subset of

      Annex A  
          
         The link hints listed in this document aim to be generic and not 
         specific to a technology.  However, the listed fields are designed to 
         represent the parameters of each heterogeneous technology.  In this 
         annex, we propose a way to illustrate them.
