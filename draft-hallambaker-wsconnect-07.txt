                     draft-hallambaker-wsconnect-07

Abstract

   Service Connection Service (SXS) is a JSON/REST Web Service that may 
   be used to establish and maintain a 'connection binding' of a device 
   to an account held with a Web Service Provider. Multiple connection 
   bindings may be established under the same account to support 
   multiple devices and/or multiple users of a single device. A 
   connection binding permits a device to securely connect to one or 
   more services offered by the Web Service Provider with support for 
   protocol and protocol version agilty and fault tollerance. 

   The protocol is presented as a HTTP/JSON Web Service and uses the 
   HTTP session continuation mechanism for authentication of transaction
   messages and supports negotiation of a HTTP session continuation 
   mechanism context for the established endpoint connections.

1. Definitions

1.1. Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

2. Introduction and Purpose

   Service Connection Service (SXS) is a Web Service that may be used to
   establish and maintain a 'connection binding' of a device to an 
   account held with a Web Service Provider (WSP). 

   SXS is presented in JSON encoding [RFC4627] over a HTTP Session 
   [RFC2616] using HTTP Session Continuation [I-D.hallambaker-
   httpsession] for message layer authentication and TLS transport for 
   confidentiality and server authentication [RFC4627]. 

   A Connection Binding comprises a set of long term credentials used to
   authenticate interactions with the SXS service itself and a set of 
   'Service Connections' to specific services offered by the Web Service
   Provider. 

   Each service connection in turn comprises a collection of 'Instance 
   Connections' which describe a specific instances of the Web Service. 

   For example Alice is a consumer and example.com a provider of a range
   of Web Services including anti-malware protection and management of 
   home automation devices. Alice has 42 devices of different types that
   each make use of one or more of the Web Services proviced by 
   example.com. All the devices are enrolled in the same SXS account 
   'alice@example.com' but each device has a unique connection binding 
   and different devices make use of different Web Services. 

   The centralized account provides Alice with a single point of control
   from which she can authorize the addition of new devices to the 
   account or the removal of devices that are deactivated. This allows 
   Alice to avoid the need to manage a device such as a network-enabled 
   lightswitch through the lightswitch itself. 

   To ensure continuity of service in case of network failure or 
   administration work, example.com provides multiple instances of its 
   Web Services hosted on different machines. Different users MAY be 
   granted access to a different collection of service instances 
   according to their needs and the service tier they are subscribed to.

2.1. Establishing a Web Service Provider Account

   The means by which the Web Service Provider Account is established is
   outside the scope of this document. 

   In a typical case the user would establish an account with their 
   chosen Web Service Provider through the normal process of using a Web
   Browser to access the Web Service Provider's site and entering such 
   data as the Web Service Provider requires into a HTML form. 

   Depending on the circumstances, the data provided by the applicant 
   may require verification before the account is created. 

   [Default accounts for appliances that are going to be implicitly 
   authenticated by reference to the network they are on.] 

2.2. Establishing a Connection Binding

   A connection binding represents a long term association between a 
   device and an account at the Web Service Provider. The association 
   includes the establishment of an authentication context between the 
   device and the SXS service. 

   An authentication context consists of: A Context Identifier. An 
   authentication algorithm. A secret key. 

   The context identifier is an opaque string assigned by the SXS 
   service. Following the approach introduced in Kerberos, a SXS service
   MAY eliminate the need to store authentication context information by
   encoding the authentication algorithm and encrypted secret key in the
   context identifier. 

   The authentication context can ensure that future communications are 
   secured against impersonation if and only if the original process of 
   establishing a connection binding was secured against communication. 
   Mutual authentication is therefore an essential requirement. 

   The means by which the connection binding is established depend on 
   the affordances of the device in question. Establishing a connection 
   binding to a device with a keyboard is easily accomplished through 
   use of a one-time PIN code. But many embedded devices do not provide 
   a keyboard or similar affordance. 

   The following modes of session establishement are supported: 

      *  Anonymous.

      *  PIN Code Establishement.

      *  Out of Band Completion.

      *  QR Code Establishement.

2.2.1. Anonymous.

   [TBS]

2.2.2. PIN Code Establishement.

   To establish a connection binding for a new mobile phone, Alice logs 
   into her SXS account manager and requests a new PIN code. She then 
   starts the application that makes use of a SXS account and selects 
   'create new binding'. She is prompted for and enters her account name
   (alice@example.com) and PIN.

   The client connects to the SXS service and verifies that the TLS 
   certificate presented is correct for example.com and has been issued 
   in accordance with issue practices that ensure an appropriately high 
   degree of trust (e.g. the CABForum Extended Validation requirements).

2.2.3. Out of Band Completion.

   To establish a connection binding for her new toaster oven, Alice 
   plugs the appliance into her local network and enters her account 
   name into the device. Since she has not obtained a PIN code in 
   advance, she leaves the entry blank. 

   To complete the process, Alice logs into her SXS account where she 
   sees that a new device is available to add to the account. To help 
   identify the correct device, there is a picture of the toaster oven, 
   the model name and serial number. 

2.2.4. QR Code Preauthorization.

   Alice decides to remodel the kitchen completely and plans to install 
   a dozen new network enabled LED light fixtures. Using an application 
   on the mobile phone she enabled earlier, Alice scans a QR code 
   attached to each fixture before the devices are installed. When the 
   fixtures are installed and powered, the connection binding is 
   preauthorized. 

3. Example Uses

3.1. PIN code establishment

   Alice buys a new laptop computer which she wishes to use with the 
   malware protection service provided by example.com. Alice has an 
   existing account 'alice' with this Web Service Provider and obtains a
   pin code Q80370-1RA606-F04B from the Web Service Provider Web site. 






Hallam-Baker               November 10, 2014                    [Page 7]

Internet-Draft      Service Connection Service (SXS)            May 2014

   Alice enters the values alice@example.com and Q80370-1RA606-F04B into
   the Web Service client she wishes to use with the Web Service 
   Provider on the new laptop. 

   The client obtains the SXS service for example.com using DNS SRV 
   discovery. The client establishes a TLS connection to the service and
   verifies that the certificate provided has a valid certificate path, 
   has not been revoked and meets the validation criteria of the client.
   Since the purpose of this particular Web Service client is to provide
   security, the client requires that an Extended Validation certificate
   be presented. 

   Having established a TLS connection to the SXS Service, the client 
   sends the following HTTP request: 

   
   POST /.well-known/sxs-connect/ HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
   Cache-Control: no-store
   Host: localhost:8080
   Content-Length: 368
   Expect: 100-continue
   Connection: Keep-Alive
   
   {
     "OpenPINRequest": {
       "Encryption": ["A128CBC",
         "A256CBC",
         "A128GCM",
         "A256GCM"],
       "Authentication": ["HS256",
         "HS384",
         "HS512",
         "HS256T128"],
       "Account": "alice",
       "Service": ["sxs-confirm-user",
         "omni-query"],
       "Domain": "example.com",
       "HaveDisplay": false,
       "Challenge": "
   sKA6bc3nmz3uprQBBU2zAg"}}
   

   To prevent man in the middle attack, the client does not send the PIN
   code in the initial request. The PIN code is only sent after the 
   service responds with a challenge nonce to be used to prevent replay 
   attack. 

   The service receives the request, determines that is meets its access
   control policy and selects a set of cryptographic parameters from the
   set proposed by the client. In this case the service prefers the use 



Hallam-Baker               November 10, 2014                    [Page 8]

Internet-Draft      Service Connection Service (SXS)            May 2014

   of AES128CBC for encryption and the HS256 Message Authentication Code
   for authentication. 

   The service determines that a PIN code has been issued for the 
   account and uses the value of that PIN to generate a response to the 
   challenge presented by the client. A new challenge is generated to 
   test the client knowledge of the PIN. 

   [TBS: Is there a need for the service to be able to support multiple 
   outstanding PIN codes for the same account? This could be supported 
   by providing the last 2 significant characters of the PIN code to the
   service which could use it as an index. This would enable several 
   hundred simultaneous outstanding requests which should be enough for 
   most applications. Large volume applications would need to use a 
   different scheme.] 

   The service sends the following response to the client: 

   HTTP/1.1 OK Success
   Content-Length: 501
   Date: Fri, 09 May 2014 20:58:44 GMT
   Server: Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0
   
   {

   QwFWonJ0GRP2lHbdGh7cUA"}}}

   To complete the transaction, the client sends a TicketRequest message
   to the service containing a response to the PIN challenge sent by the
   service (ChallengeResponse). 

   The TicketRequest message is authenticated using HTTP Session 
   authentication under the shared secret specified in the OpenResponse 
   message:

       "ChallengeResponse": "
   pPTHKBhgjy458yZ0sLmbwTz3X0V48sl5QFM1nDJ5nbs"}}

   The service checks the value of ChallengeResponse against the known 
   PIN and if the result is correct establishes parameters for the 
   Connection Binding for the device. 

   In this case the server uses the Session Id parameter to encode 
   permissions associated with the request as described in [Appendix 
   TBS]. Accordingly the server must replace the Session Id whenever the
   associated permissions change. Accordingly, the server replaces the 
   cryptographic parameters specified in the OpenResponse request for 
   use in future SXS service requests. In this case the server returns 
   three connections, each offering a different transport protocol 
   option. Each connection specifies its own set of cryptographic 
   parameters (or will when the code is written for that). 

   The service also returns a service connection the malware protection 
   service the client requested access to. This service connection 
   specifies three different service instances. Each service instance 
   has its own set of cryptographic parameters for use with HTTP session
   authentication. In this case the three different service instances 
   offer different means of accessing the same service: as a JSON Web 
   Service over HTTP, using a binary encoding over a UDP transport and 
   tunnelling via DNS.

3.2. Unbinding

   After a year of use, Alice decides to replace the laptop with a new 
   one. Before selling the old laptop on EBay, she tells the Web Service
   client to cancel the connection to the Web Service Provider. 

   The client sends the following mesasage to the provider: 

   POST /.well-known/sxs-connect/ HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
   Cache-Control: no-store
   Session: Value=k6kaBdumXWBHcMXiRHL8HyF49beYScWIx287K-dws6c;

   {
     "UnbindRequest": {}}

   The Session ID specifies the connection binding. Since the Unbind 
   Request is only valid for that connection binding, there is no need 
   to specify the connection binding further in the request. 

   The server verifies that the request was authenticated and returns a 
   successful response:

3.3. Out of Band Completion

   Alice purchases an Internet enabled coffee pot. The installer 
   configures the coffee pot in her kitchen but does not have access to 
   Alice's SXS account or a PIN code to configure it. 

   The installer configures the coffee pot to use the SXS account 
   specified by Alice. The coffee pot does not have a pssscode to enter 
   but does have a link to an image of the coffee pot. 

   The client sends the following request: 

   [TBS: non pin code example] 

   Since the client does not have a PIN code, there is no need to return
   a challenge. Instead the service returns the status "OOB" to indicate
   that the transaction will be completed out of band. 

   [TBS: non pin code example] 

   By default the coffee pot attempts to complete the SXS connection at 
   ten second intervals for the first ten minutes, every thirty seconds 
   for the next hour, every five minutes for the following 24 hours and 
   once an hour thereafter. 

   The client sends the following request to check the status of the 
   request: 

   [TBS: should add in a parameter 'don't call again for x seconds'] 

   The first service response tells the coffee pot not to ask again 
   until five minutes have elapsed: 

   [TBS: non pin code example] 

   The installer calls Alice to tell her that the coffee pot is ready to
   connect. Alice authorizes the connection remotely via the Web Service
   Provider's Web site. Alice identifies the request to connect the 
   coffee pot by means of the image provided. She can also use the same 
   image to help determine which connection to cancel when the coffee 
   pot is replaced. 

   The next time the coffee pot requests a status update, the service 
   responds with the connection binding parameters:

4.2. BindPIN

   Binding a device with mutual authentication is a two step protocol 
   that begins with the OpenPINRequest followed by the Ticket Request. 

4.2.1. Message: OpenPINRequest

   The OpenRequest Message is used to begin a device binding 
   transaction. Depending on the authentication requirements of the 
   service the transaction may be completed in a single query or require
   a further Ticket Query to complete. 

   If authentication is required, the mechanism to be used depends on 
   the capabilities of the device, the requirements of the broker and 
   the existing relationship between the user and the broker. 

   If the device supports some means of data entry, authentication MAY 
   be achieved by entering a passcode previously delivered out of band 
   into the device. 

   The OpenRequest specifies the properties of the service (Account, 
   Domain) and Device (ID, URI, Name) that will remain constant 
   throughout the period that the device binding is active and 
   parameters to be used for the mutual authentication protocol. 

      Account :

   Reports on the success of the unbinding operation. 

   If the server reports success, the client SHOULD delete the ticket 
   and all information relating to the binding.

Internet-Draft      Service Connection Service (SXS)            May 2014

   A service MAY continue to accept a ticket after an unbind request has
   been granted but MUST NOT accept such a ticket for a bind request. 

5. Mutual Authentication

   A Connection Service MAY require that a connection request be 
   authenticated. Two authentication mechanisms are defined. 

      PIN Code
         The client and server demonstrate mutual knowledge of a PIN 
         code previously exchanged out of band. 

      Out of Band Confirmation
         The request for access is confirmed out of band. 

   In addition, services MAY accept the use of any message or transport 
   layer authentication scheme. For example HTTP Session Continuation or
   Transport Layer Security with client authentication. 

5.1. PIN Authentication

   PIN code authentication provides users with a simple and often 
   familiar mechanism for authenticating the connection request. The 
   means by which the user obtains the PIN code is outside the scope of 
   this document. Possible methods for distributing the PIN code include
   obtaining the code from an account management Web site provided by 
   the Web Service Provider, letter post, email and in person. 

   Although the PIN value is never exposed on the wire in any form, the 
   protcol considers the PIN value to be text encoded in UTF8 encoding. 

   To encourage readability, the use of space (0x20) and hyphen (0x2D) 
   characters to arrange PIN characters into groups of four to seven 
   characters is encouraged. To avoid the risk of this practice 
   introducing user error, space and hyphen characters are ignored when 
   processing the PIN value. 

   Support for the full UNICODE character set in PIN codes is intended 
   to facilitate provision of PIN codes in the user's native language. 
   Web Service Providers MAY make use of any UNICODE characters they 
   choose but capricious choices are likely to cause users difficulty. 
   For example a PIN code MAY contain the ZAPF Dingbats thick tick mark 
   (U+2704) but users would almost certainly find it difficult to enter 
   and may confuse it with the similar thin tick mark (U+2703). 

   Servers that support PIN Authorization SHOULD offer the choice of a 
   PIN that only uses numeric digits ('0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6',
   '7', '8', '9'). Clients that support PIN Authorization MUST allow 
   entry of PINS that only contain numeric digits. 





Hallam-Baker               November 10, 2014                   [Page 19]

Internet-Draft      Service Connection Service (SXS)            May 2014

   The PIN Mechanism is a three step process: 

The client sends an OpenRequest message to the Service containing a 
challenge value CC. 
The service returns an OpenResponse message containing to the client a 
server challenge value SV and a server response value SR. 
The client sends a TicketRequest message to the service containing a 
client response value CR. 

   Since no prior authentication key has been established the 
   OpenRequest and OpenResponse messages are sent without message 
   authentication. 

   The Challenge values CC, and SC are cryptographic nonces. The nonces 
   SHOULD be generated using an appropriate cryptographic random source.
   The nonces MUST be at least as long as 128 bits, MUST be at least the
   minimum key size of the authentication algorithm used and MUST NOT 
   more than 640 bits in length (640 bits should be enough for anybody).

   The server response and client response values are generated using an
   authentication algorithm selected by the server from the choices 
   proposed by the client in the OpenRequest message. 

   The algorithn chosen may be a MAC algorithm or an encrypt-with-
   authentication (EWA) algorithm. If an EWA is specified, the encrypted
   data is discarded and only the authentication value is used in its 
   place. 

   Let A(d,k) be the authentication value obtained by applying the 
   authentication algorithm with key k to data d. 

   To create the Server Response value, the UTF8 encoding of the PIN 
   value 'P' is first pre-processed to remove space and hyphen 
   characters, then converted into a symmetric key KPC by using the 
   Client challenge value as the key truncating if necessary and then 
   applied to the of the OpenRequest message: 

   [
   	KPC = A (PIN, CC)
   	SR = A (Secret + OpenRequest, KPC)

   In the Web Service Binding, the Payload of the message is the HTTP 
   Body as presented on the wire. The Secret and Server Challenge are 
   presented in their binary format and the '+' operator stands for 
   simple concatenation of the binary sequences. 

   This protocol construction ensures that the party constructing SR: 

   Knows the PIN code value (through the construction of KPC). Is 
   responding to the Open Request Message (SR depends on OpenRequest). 
   Has knowlege of the secret key which MUST be used to authenticate the

Internet-Draft      Service Connection Service (SXS)            May 2014

   following TicketRequest/TicketResponse interaction that will 
   establish the actual connection. Does not provide an oracle the PIN 
   value. That is, the protocol does not provide a service that reveals 
   the (since the value SR includes the value SC which is a random nonce
   generated by the server and cannot be predicted by the client). 

   To create the Client Response value, secret key is applied to the PIN
   value and server Challenge: 

   
   	CR = A (PIN + SC + OpenResponse, Secret)

   Note that the server can calculate the value of the Client Response 
   token at the time that it generates the Server Challenge. This 
   minimizes the amount of state that needs to be carried from one 
   request to the next in the Ticket value when using the stateless 
   server implementation described in section 

   This protocol construction ensures that the generator of CR 

   Knows the PIN value. Is respoding to the OpenResponse generated by 
   the server. 

   Note that while disclosure of an oracle for the PIN value is a 
   concern in the construction of CR, this is not the case in the 
   construction of SR since the client has already demonstrated 
   knowledge of the PIN value. 

5.1.1. Example: Latin PIN Code

   The Connection Request example of section demonstrates the use of an 
   alphanumeric PIN code using the Latin alphabet. 

   The PIN code is [[Q80370-1RA606-F04B] and the authentication 
   algorithm is [[HS256]. The value KPC is calculated thus: 

   PIN: 51 38 30 33 37 30 2d 31 52 41 36 30 36 2d 46 30 34 42 

   Client Challenge: b0 a0 3a 6d cd e7 9b 3d ee a6 b4 01 05 4d b3 02

   c2 79 67 29 c5 89 8b 84 c8 2e cc 

   For the sake of example, we take the OpenRequest message payload to 
   be {...}. The data over which the hash value is calulated is Secret +
   OpenRequest:

   The rest of the protocol would then continue as before. 

5.2. Out of Band Confirmation

   The Out Of Band Confirmation mechanism is a three step process in 
   which: 

      *  The client makes an OpenRequest message to the service and 
         obtains an OpenResponse message. 

      *  The connection binding is authorized through an out of band 
         process. 

      *  The client makes a TicketRequest to the service and obtains a 
         TicketResponse message to complete the exchange. 

   Since no prior authentication key has been established the 
   OpenRequest and OpenResponse messages are sent without 
   authentication. 




Hallam-Baker               November 10, 2014                   [Page 22]

Internet-Draft      Service Connection Service (SXS)            May 2014

   The principal concern in the Out Of Band Confirmation mechanism is 
   ensuring that the party authorizing the request is able to identify 
   which party originated the request they are attempting to identify. 

   If a device has the ability to display an image it MAY set the 
   HasDisplay=true in the OpenRequest message. If the broker recieves an
   OpenRequest with the HasDisplay value set to true, the OpenResponse 
   MAY contain one or more VerificationImage entries specifying image 
   data that is to be displayed to the user by both the client and the 
   confirmation interface. 

   Before confirming the request, the user SHOULD verify that the two 
   images are the same and reject the request in the case that they are 
   not. 

   Many devices do not have a display capability, in particular an 
   embedded device such as a network switch or a thermostat. In this 
   case the device MAY be identified by means of the information 
   provided in DeviceID, DeviceURI, DeviceImage and DeviceName. 

6. Protocol Binding

   A single protocol binding is defined: 

      *  JSON encoding is used to express SXS messages.

      *  A HTTP session layer with HTTP session continuation is used for
         message authentication.

      *  TLS transport is required for confidentiality and service 
         authentication.

   Implementations MAY support use of alternative encodings, session 
   layers or transports provided that the necessary confidentiality and 
   authentication criteria described below are met. The means by which 
   negotiation of the use of such encodings is achieved is outside the 
   scop of this document. 

6.1. JSON encoding

   Messages are expressed in JSON encoding [RFC4627]. 

   Protocol schema types are mapped to JSON encoding as follows: 

      Integer
         Data of type Integer is encoded using the JSON number encoding.

      Name
         Data of type Name is encoded using the JSON string encoding.





Hallam-Baker               November 10, 2014                   [Page 23]

Internet-Draft      Service Connection Service (SXS)            May 2014

      String
         Data of type String is encoded using the JSON string encoding.

      Binary
         Data of type Binary is converted to strings using the Base64url
         encoding specified in [!RFC4648] /> and encoded using the JSON 
         string type.

      DateTime
         Data of type DateTime is converted to string using the UTC time
         conversion specified in [!RFC3339] /> with a UTC offset of 
         00:00.

6.1.1. HTTP Session Layer

   Messages are presented over a HTTP session layer [RFC2616]. The use 
   of HTTP as a session layer permits multiple Web Services on the same 
   host to share the same DNS name, IP address and port number and 
   enables use of HTTP Session Continuation [I-D.hallambaker-
   httpsession] for message authentication. 

   Use of HTTP Session Continuation mechanism allows message 
   authentication data to be presented in the HTTP message header rather
   than the message content provides a clean separation of the message 
   authentication data from the data being authenticated. The scope of 
   the authentication data is simply the message content after transport
   encoding (e.g. chunked) has been removed. 

   The use of HTTP session continuation is necessary to achieve mutual 
   authentication even though TLS transport is required. 

   Only the HTTP Session header is used. The negotiation of the Session 
   parameters is performed within SXS. 

   [TO-DO: Specify TLS binding options?] 

   [TO-DO: Switch back from using JOSE algorithm names to HTTP Session 
   algorithm names] 

6.1.2. TLS transport

   TLS transport [RFC4627] is used 

   Support for the PKIX logotype extension [RFC3709] is highly 
   recommended 

   Use of an enhanced assurance certificate (e.g. CABForum EV) is likely
   to be required in most applications and is strongly recommended if 
   Lotypes are used.

7. Service Identification and Discovery

   The prefix '[PREFIX-TBD]' has been registered for use as a protocol 
   identifier for SXS in the URI, SRV and Well Known Location 
   registries. 

   The URI form identifying a SXS account identifier is: 

   PREFIX-TBD:<service>:<account>:< or PREFIX-
   TBD:<service>:<account>:<:subaccount> 

   Where <service> is the DNS name of the Web Service Provider, 
   <account> is the name of the account at the service provider and 
   <subaccount> is an optional sub-account specifier. 

   Use of the URI form is only needed in cases where the purpose of the 
   identifier is not clear from the context, in a HTML anchor for 
   example. A SXS client requesting entry of the service account 
   identifier MUST support entry of the short form identifier: 

   <account>@<service> or <:subaccount>/<account>@<service> 

   DNS Service (SRV) record discovery is the preferred method of host 
   discovery as this provides for fault tollerance and load balancing. 

   SXS clients SHOULD support use of DNS SRV records for host discovery 
   and MUST support use of DNS A/AAAA records for host discovery. 

   A compliant SXS service MUST be offered at the .well-known location 
   /.well-known/PREFIX-TBD. Use of SXS protocol at other service 
   locations is permissible for testing and protocol development 
   purposes but such configurations are not compliant and clients are 
   not required to support them. The URL for the SXS service is 
   therefore: 

   https://<service>/.well-known/PREFIX-TBD 

8. UDP Binding

   The UDP Binding allows a transaction to be transmitted as a single 
   UDP packet request followed by up to 16 UDP response packets. The 
   message encapsulation is described using the format desribed in 
   [RFC5246]. Note that in this notation the size of a length specifier 
   is defined by the maximum number of octets permitted in the 
   corresponding data field. For convenience these sizes are given as 
   255 or 65335 to specify 1 and 2 byte length specifiers respectively. 
   The actual length of the data fields that can be used in practice 
   will depend on the maximum size of UDP packet that can be reliably 
   transmitted.

   opaque SecurityContextID<1..255>

8.1. Request

   If the UDP transport is in use, a request consists of exactly one 
   packet.

   A request has the following structure:

   struct {
       TransactionID       transactionID;
       SecurityContextID   securityContextID;
       opaque              encryptedPayload<1..65535>
       opaque              authenticationCode<1..255>
       } Request;

   Where:

      transactionID
         Is a unquie identifier for the transaction and an input to the 
         function used to derrive the initialization vector (IV) for the
         encryption algorithm

      securityContextID
         Is the opaque security context identifier returned by the 
         Service Connect Service.

      encryptedPayload
         Is the encrypted message payload.

8.2. Response

   A response MAY consist of 1 or up to 16 packets, each formatted as 
   follows:

   struct {
       TransactionID       transactionID;
       uint8               index;
       uint8               maxIndex;
       uint16              clearResponse;
       opaque              encryptedPayloadSegment<0..65535>
       opaque              authenticationCode<1..255>  
       } Response;

   Where:

      transactionID
         Is a unquie identifier for the transaction and an input to the 
         function used to derrive the initialization vector (IV) for the
         encryption algorithm



Hallam-Baker               November 10, 2014                   [Page 26]

Internet-Draft      Service Connection Service (SXS)            May 2014


      index
         Is the index number of this response packet.

      maxIndex
         Is the index number of the last packet. The value of maxIndex 
         MUST be the same for every packet. Receivers MUST reject 
         packets

      clearResponse
         Is a response code sent enclair. The value 0 indicates a 
         successful response. Error codes TBS. It might be expedient to 
         merge these with index and maxIndex to shave some bytes.

      encryptedPayloadSegment
         Is the encrypted message payload segment.

   To obtain the encryptedPayload of the response, the receiver:

      *  Waits for all the response packets to arrive

      *  Sorts the response packets by the value of index.

      *  Extracts the value of encryptedPayloadSegment from each 
         response

      *  Concatenate the values of encryptedPayloadSegment to obtain the
         encryptedPayload value

   UDP packets MAY be sent out of order and the order in which they were
   received MAY not match the order in which they were sent. A receiver 
   MUST accept response packets recieved in any order.

8.3. Payload

   The payload is a sequence of the following types of data:

      JSONData
         Payload data in JSON encoding

      JSONCData
         Payload data in JSON-C encoding as described in [!I-
         D.hallambaker-jsonbcd]

      DNSMessageEntry 
         A DNS Message as specified in [RFC1035]

      PaddingEntry 
         The Payload MAY contain padding.

Internet-Draft      Service Connection Service (SXS)            May 2014

      LastMAC 
         MAC value from the previous message in the transaction.

      SecurityContextIDEntry 
         A replacement security context identifier.

      KeyEntry 
         A secret key for use with the immediately preceeding 
         SecurityContextID.

      Future use
         The Payload may contain additional options (To be defined)

   The payload data is encoded according to the following schema:

   enum {PaddingEntry (0), SecurityContextIDEntry (2), 
           KeyEntry (3), LastMac (4), JSONData (16), JSONCData (17), 
           DNSMessageEntry (18), (255)} PayloadEntryType;
   
   struct {
       PayloadEntryType	entryType;
       opaque              data<0..65535>
       } Response;

   The SecurityContextIDEntry and KeyEntry data types are used by the 
   server to issue a new security context and key to the client. 
   Changing the security context identifier prevents linkage of 
   transactions across network configurations.

   One consequence of putting the LastMAC value inside the Payload data 
   is that this provides an attacker with a sequence of known plaintext 
   and ciphertext.

12. Stateless server

   The protocol is designed to permit but not require the server to 
   store connection binding state in the Session ID of the HTTP Session 
   Continuation authentication mechanism. 

   The Session IDs are opaque as far as the client is concerned. The 
   client receives the Session ID from the service and returns it with 
   each request. The internal structure of the Session ID is therefore 
   outside the scope of this specification but is provided here to 
   assist implementers. 

   In the PIN Authentication example, two SessionIDs are issued by the 
   server: 

      *  A temporary ID in response to the initial client OpenRequest. 

      *  A connection binding ID when the client PIN confirmation is 
         accepted and the connection binding is created. 

   Both tickets have the same common wrapper structure: 

   IV + Encrypt ( Ticket + Mac ( Ticket, Key) Key) 

   Where:

      IV
         The Initialization vector for the encryption scheme

      Encrypt
         The Encryption algorithm (AES in CBC Mode)

      Ticket
         The ticket data

      MAC
         The Message Authentication algorithm (HMAC-SHA2-256)

12.1. Temporary ID

   The temporary ticket returned in the OpenRequest example above is 
   represented in Base64URL encoding as follows:

   The encrypted data is decrypted under the master key of the server.

   change over time. There should really be a key index prefixing it to 
   identify the key number.
