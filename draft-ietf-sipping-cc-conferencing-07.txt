Abstract

   This specification defines conferencing call control features for the
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  This document builds on the
   Conferencing Requirements and Framework documents to define how a
   tightly coupled SIP conference works.  The approach is explored from
   different user agent (UA) types perspective: conference-unaware,
   conference-aware and focus UAs.  The use of URIs in conferencing,
   OPTIONS for capabilities discovery, and call control using REFER are

1.  Introduction

   This specification uses the concepts and definitions from the high
   level requirements [14] and the SIP conferencing framework [8]
   documents.  This approach is applicable to tightly coupled SIP
   conferences.  In this architecture, a UA, known as participant,
   establishes a SIP dialog with another UA, known as a focus.  The
   focus is the central point of control, authentication, and
   authorization.  This specification defines the operation of a focus
   and participant UAs.  Note that only the signaling (SIP) needs to be
   centralized in this model - the media can be centrally mixed,
   distributed, or even multicast.  For a full discussion of this
   architecture, see the SIP conferencing framework [8] document.

   The approach described in this document implements key functions in
   the conferencing framework using SIP primitives only.  This allows
   for conducting simple conferences with defined functionalities using
   SIP mechanisms and conventions.  Many other advanced functions can be
   implemented using additional means but they are not in the scope of
   this document.

   This document presents the basic call control (dial-in and dial-out)
   conferencing building blocks from the UA perspective.  Possible
   applications include ad-hoc conferences and scheduled conferences.

   Note that a single conference can bridge participants having
   different capabilities and who potentially have joined the conference
   by different means (i.e. dial-in, dial-out, scheduled, and ad-hoc).

   The call control and dialog manipulation approach is based on the
   multiparty framework [15] document.  That document defines the basic
   approach of service design adopted for SIP which includes:

    - Definition of primitives, not services
    - Signaling model independent
    - Invoker oriented
    - Primitives make full use of URIs
    - Include authentication, authorization, logging, etc. policies
    - Define graceful fallback to baseline SIP.

   The use of opaque URIs and the ability to communicate call control
   context information within a URI (as opposed to using service-related
   header fields), as discussed in RFC 3087 [11], is fundamental to this
   approach.

   Capabilities discovery is an important feature of SIP systems, and
   conferencing systems can make use of such features.  For a UA acting
   as a focus in a conference, this specification defines the usage of

Internet-Draft         SIP CC Conferencing for UAs             June 2005


   the 'isfocus' feature parameter.

2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.

3.  SIP User Agent Conferencing Capability Types

   From a conferencing perspective, the framework document outlines a
   number of possible different SIP components such as conference-
   unaware participant, conference-aware participant, and focus.

   This document applies the concepts above to the SIP call control part
   of the conferencing components.  It defines normative behavior of the
   SIP UAs in various conferencing situations (referred later as
   "scenarios").


3.1  Focus UA

   A focus, as defined in the framework, hosts a SIP conference and
   maintains a SIP signaling relationship with each participant in the
   conference.  A focus contains a conference-aware user agent that
   supports the conferencing call control conventions as defined in this
   document.

   A focus SHOULD support the conference package RFC XXXX [9], behave as
   a notifier for that package, and indicate its support in the Allow-
   Events header fields in requests and responses.  A focus MAY include
   information about the conference in SDP bodies sent as part of normal
   SIP signaling by populating the Session Information, URI, Email
   address, and Phone Number SDP fields.

   In order to support advanced features, where a session established
   between two endpoints can migrate to a centralized conference, a
   focus SHOULD support the Replaces [6] header field.

   A focus SHOULD utilize a GRUU as discussed in Section 4.2.

   A user agent with focus capabilities could be implemented in end user
   equipment and would be used for the creation of ad-hoc conferences.

   A dedicated conferencing server, whose primary task is to
   simultaneously host conferences of arbitrary type and size, may
   allocate and publish a conference factory URI (as defined in the next



Johnston & Levin        Expires December 5, 2005                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft         SIP CC Conferencing for UAs             June 2005


   section) for creating an arbitrary number of ad-hoc conferences (and
   subsequently their focuses) using SIP call control means.


3.2  Conference Factory URI

   According to the framework, there are many ways in which a conference
   can be created.  A conferencing server implementation is free to
   choose from these methods, which include non-automated means (such as
   an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system), SIP, or any conference
   control protocol.

   In order to automatically create an arbitrary number of ad-hoc
   conferences (and subsequently their focuses) using SIP call control
   means, a globally routable Conference Factory URI can be allocated
   and published.

   A successful attempt to establish a call to this URI would result in
   the automatic creation a new conference and its focus.  As a result,
   note that the Conference Factory URI and the newly created focus URI
   MAY resolve to different physical devices.

   A scenario showing the use of the conference factory URI is shown in
   Section 5.4.

3.3  Conference-Unaware UA

   The simplest user agent can participate in a conference ignoring all
   SIP conferencing-related information.  The simplest user agent is
   able to dial into a conference and to be invited to a conference.
   Any conferencing information is optionally conveyed to/from it using
   non-SIP means.  Such a user agent would not usually host a conference
   (at least, not using SIP explicitly).  A conference-unaware UA need
   only support RFC 3261 [2].  Call flows for conference-unaware UAs are
   not shown in general in this document as they would be identical to
   those in the SIP call flows [13] document.

   Note that the presence of an 'isfocus' feature tag in a Contact
   header field will not cause interoperability issues between a focus
   and a conference-unaware UA since it will be treated as an unknown
   header parameter and ignored, as per standard SIP behavior.

3.4  Conference-Aware UA

   A conference-aware user agent supports SIP conferencing call control
   conventions defined in this document as a conference participant, in
   addition to support of RFC 3261 [2].  A conference-aware UA should be
   able to process SIP redirections such as described in section 8.1.3.4



Johnston & Levin        Expires December 5, 2005                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft         SIP CC Conferencing for UAs             June 2005


   of RFC 3261.

   A conference-aware UA MUST recognize the 'isfocus' feature parameter.
   A conference-aware UA SHOULD support REFER [4], SIP events [3], and
   the conferencing package [9].

   A conference-aware UA SHOULD subscribe to the conference package if
   the 'isfocus' parameter is in the remote target URI of a dialog and
   if the conference package is listed by a focus in an Allow-Events
   header field.  The SUBSCRIBE to the conference package SHOULD be sent
   outside any INVITE-initiated dialog.  A termination of the INVITE
   dialog with a BYE does not necessarily terminate the SUBSCRIBE
   dialog.

   A conference-aware UA MAY render to the user any information about
   the conference obtained from the SIP header fields and SDP fields
   from the focus.

   A conference-aware UA SHOULD render to the user any information about
   the conference obtained from the SIP conference package.

4.  Usage of the 'isfocus' Feature Parameter

4.1  General

   The main design guidelines for the development of SIP extensions and
   conventions for conferencing are to define the minimum number of
   extensions and to have seamless backwards compatibility with
   conference-unaware SIP UAs.  The minimal requirement for SIP is being
   able to express that a dialog is a part of a certain conference
   referenced to by a URI.  As a result of these extensions, it is
   possible to do the following using SIP:

    - Create a conference
    - Join a conference
    - Invite a user to a conference
    - Expel a user by third party
    - Discover if a URI is a conference URI
    - Delete a conference

   The approach taken is to use the feature parameter 'isfocus' to
   express that a SIP dialog belongs to a conference.  The use of
   feature parameters in Contact header fields to describe the
   characteristics and capabilities of a UA is described in the User
   Agent Capabilities [5] document, which includes the definition of the
   'isfocus' feature parameter.

Internet-Draft         SIP CC Conferencing for UAs             June 2005


4.2  Session Establishment

   In session establishment, a focus MUST include the 'isfocus' feature
   parameter in the Contact header field unless the focus wishes to hide
   the fact that it is a focus.  To a participant, the feature parameter
   will be associated with the remote target URI of the dialog.  It is
   an indication to a conference-aware UA that the resulting dialog
   belongs to a conference, identified by the URI in the Contact header
   field, and that the call control conventions defined in this document
   can be applied.

   The Conference URI MUST have the GRUU (Globally Routable User Agent
   URI) properties as detailed in [16].

4.3  Discovery

   Using the mechanism described in this section, it is possible, given
   an opaque URI, to be able to determine if it belongs to a certain
   conference (i.e. meaning that it is a conference URI) or not.  This
   discovery function can be implemented in SIP using an OPTIONS
   request, and can be done either inside an active dialog or outside a
   dialog.  A focus MUST include the 'isfocus' feature parameter in a
   200 OK response to an OPTIONS unless the focus wishes to hide the
   fact that it is a focus.

5.  SIP Conferencing Primitives

   The SIP conferencing call control flows presented in this section are
   the call control building blocks for various SIP conferencing
   applications as described in the conferencing requirements [14] and
   framework [8] documents.  The major design goal is that the same SIP
   conferencing primitives would be used by user agents having different
   conferencing capabilities and implementing different applications.

5.1  INVITE: Joining a Conference using the Conference URI - Dial-In

   In this section a user knows the conference URI and "dials in" to
   join this conference.  The focus will authenticate the participant
   and apply authorization policy before allowing the participant to
   join the conference.

   If the UA is the first participant of the conference to dial-in, it
   is likely that this INVITE will activate the focus and hence the
   conference.  However, the conference URI must have been reserved
   prior to its use.

   If the conference is up and running already, the dialing-in
   participant is joined to the conference by its focus.

Internet-Draft         SIP CC Conferencing for UAs             June 2005


   To join an existing specific conference, a UA will send an INVITE
   with the Request-URI set to the conference URI.  The focus MUST
   include the 'isfocus' feature parameter in the Contact header field
   of the 200 OK response to the INVITE.

   An example call flow for joining a conference is shown in Figure 1.

5.2  INVITE: Adding a Participant by the Focus - Dial-Out

   To directly add a participant to a conference, a focus SHOULD send an
   INVITE to the participant containing a Contact header field with the
   conference URI and the 'isfocus' feature parameter.

   Note that a conference-unaware UA would simply ignore the
   conferencing information and treat the session (from a SIP
   perspective) as a point to point session.  This is because standard
   RFC 3261 [2] behavior is to ignore unknown header parameters such as
   'isfocus'.

   An example call flow is shown in Figure 2.  It is assumed that Alice
   is already a participant of the conference.  The focus invites Carol
   to the conference by sending an INVITE.  After the session is
   established, Carol subscribes to the conference URI.  It is important
   to note that there is no dependency on Carol's SUBSCRIBE (F5) and the
   NOTIFY to Alice (F9) - they occur asynchronously and independently.

5.3  INVITE: Manually Creating a Conference by Dialing into a
     Conferencing Application

   In this section, a user sends an INVITE to a conference server
   application.  The application (such as an IVR system or a web page)
   is implemented because the system requires additional input from the
   user before it is able to create a conference.  After a normal dialog
   is established, additional information is received and the conference
   together with its focus are created.  Since the UA is now in a dialog
   with a focus, the focus will re-INVITE the user with the conference
   URI in Contact with the 'isfocus' feature parameter.

   Alternatively, the additional information can be provided by the user
   during an early dialog (see RFC 3261 [2] for a discussion of early
   dialogs in SIP).  This could be accomplished by a 183 Session
   Progress response sent by the conferencing application.  After the
   conference is created, the conference URI would then be returned in a
   Contact in the 200 OK.

   Note that since this flow is all about human interaction with a
   conferencing application, any errors and failures will be returned to
   the human (recorded announcements, error tones, etc.).

   As discussed in the conferencing framework, the conference URI must
   be unique across all distinct conferences within the same domain.  In
   general, the user part of a conference URI will contain a pseudo
   random string.

   An example call flow is shown in Figure 3.  In this example, Alice
   uses a conference application which is triggered when Alice sends an
   INVITE to the conference application.  In this example, Conf-App is
   used to represent the conference application URI.  Alice's
   conference-aware UA learns of the existence of the conference from
   the 'isfocus' feature parameter and subscribes to the conference
   package to receive notifications of the conference state.

5.4  INVITE: Creating a Conference using Ad-Hoc SIP Methods

   This section addresses creating a conference by using ad-hoc SIP
   means.  The conference factory URI (as defined in Section 3.2) is
   used to automatically create the conference in this example.  This is
   different from the previous scenario in that no human intervention is
   required - an automaton can create the conference and add
   participants.  Since the conference does not need to be scheduled or
   reserved, but is created "on the fly", it is an "ad-hoc" conference
   creation.

   The benefit of this approach is that the conference URI need not be
   known to the user - instead it is created by a focus and used by the
   participants' UAs.  The main difference between this scenario and
   Section 5.3 is that no user intervention (IVR, web page form, etc.)
   is required to create the conference.

   The SIP URI of the conference factory can be provisioned in the UA
   (as in a "create new conference" button on a SIP phone) or can be
   discovered using other means.

   A SIP entity (such as conferencing server) can distinguish this
   INVITE request as a request to create a new ad-hoc conference from a
   request to join an existing conference by the Request-URI.  That is,
   although both requests may route to the same application, the
   differing services requested can be identified by the differing URIs
   in the request itself.

   Assuming that all security and policy requirements have been met, a
   new conference will be created with the Contact URI returned in the
   200 OK being the conference URI.  The Contact header field MUST
   contain the 'isfocus' feature parameter to indicate that this URI is
   for a conference.

   An example call flow is shown in Figure 4.  Note that Conf-Factory is
   shorthand for the conference factory URI and Conf-ID Is short for the
   conference URI.  In this flow, Alice has a conference-aware UA and
   creates a conference by sending an INVITE to the conference factory
   URI.  The conference factory application creates the conference and
   redirects Alice to the focus using a 302 Moved Temporarily response.
   Note that with proxy recursion as part of normal RFC 3261 [2]
   behavior, Alice may never see the redirect but may just receive the
   responses from the focus starting with message F5.  Once the media
   session is established, Alice subscribes to the conference URI
   obtained through the Contact in the 200 OK response from the focus.

   Figure 4. Creation of a Conference using SIP Ad-Hoc Methods.


5.5  REFER: Requesting a Focus to Add a New Resource to a Conference
     (Dial-out to a new Participant)

   A SIP conference URI can be used to inject different kinds of
   information into the conference.  Examples include new participants,
   new real-time media sources, new IM messages, and pointers to passive
   information references (such as HTTP URIs).

   To request the focus add a new information resource to the specified
   conference, any SIP UA can send a REFER to the conference URI with a
   Refer-To containing the URI of the new resource.  Since this REFER is
   sent to the conference URI and not the conference factory URI, the
   semantics to the focus are to bring the resource into the conference



Johnston & Levin        Expires December 5, 2005               [Page 19]

Internet-Draft         SIP CC Conferencing for UAs             June 2005


   and make it visible to the conference participants.  The resultant
   focus procedures are dependent both on the nature of the new resource
   (as expressed by its URI) and the policy of the focus regarding IM,
   central vs. distributed real time media processing, etc.

   The scenario for adding a new UA participant is important to support
   because it works even if the new participant does not support REFER
   and transfer call control - only the requesting participant and the
   focus need to support the REFER and transfer call control.

   Upon receipt of the REFER containing a Refer-To header with a SIP
   URI, the focus SHOULD send an INVITE to the new participant
   identified by the Refer-To SIP URI containing a Contact header field
   with the conference URI and the 'isfocus' feature parameter.

   A conference-unaware UA would simply ignore the conferencing
   information and treat the session (from a SIP perspective) as a point
   to point session.

   An example call flow is shown in Figure 5.  While this flow shows the
   use of REFER to add a new participant to the conference, the
   mechanism can generally add a resource as identified by a URI to the
   conference.  It is assumed that Alice is already a participant of the
   conference.  Alice sends a REFER to the conference URI.  The focus
   invites Carol to the conference by sending an INVITE.  After the
   session is established, Carol subscribes to the conference URI.  It
   is important to note that there is no dependency on Carol's SUBSCRIBE
   (F11) and the NOTIFY to Alice (F15) - they occur asynchronously and
   independently.

5.6  REFER: Requesting a User to Dial into a Conference Using a
     Conference URI

   A participant wishing to add a new participant will request this
   participant to send an INVITE to the conference URI.  This can be
   done using a non-SIP means (such as passing or publishing the
   conference URI in an email, IM, or web page).  If a non-SIP means is
   used, then the flow and requirements are identical to Section 5.1.

   The SIP mechanism to do this utilizes the REFER method.

   A UA wishing to add a new participant SHOULD send a REFER request to
   the participant with a Refer-To header containing the conference URI.

   The requirements are then identical to the dial-in case of Section
   5.1.  The inviting participant MAY receive notification through the
   REFER action that the new participant has been added in addition to
   the notification received through the conference package.

   An example is shown in Figure 6.  In this call flow, it is assumed
   that Alice is already a participant of the conference.  Alice sends
   Bob an "out of band" REFER - that is, a REFER outside of an
   established dialog.  Should Bob reject the REFER, Alice might try
   sending an INVITE to Bob to establish a session first, then send a
   REFER within the dialog, effectively transferring Bob into the
   conference [18].

   have the method set to REFER and an escaped Refer-To header field
   containing the conference URI.

   Note that in Message F1 below, the Refer-To header field is shown as
   continuing across two lines - this would not be the case in an actual
   message, the URI would have continued beyond the formatting
   limitations of this document.

   This scenario is shown in Figure 7.

5.8  Join Header Field: Dialing into a Conference Using a (3rd Party)
     Dialog Identifier

   Under some circumstances, a participant wanting to join a conference
   may only know a dialog identifier of one of the legs of the
   conference.  The information may have been learned using the dialog
   package [19] or some non-SIP means to retrieve this information from
   another conference participant.

   A UA can request to be added to a conference by sending a request to
   the focus containing a Join [7] header field containing a dialog ID
   of one leg of the conference (a dialog between another participant
   and the focus).

   There are other scenarios in which a UA can use the Join header for
   certain conferencing call control scenarios.  See [7] for further
   examples and details.

   An example is shown in Figure 8.  It is assumed that Alice is a
   participant of the conference.  The dialog identifier between Alice
   and the focus is abbreviated as A-F and is known by Bob. Bob requests
   to be added to the conference by sending an INVITE message F1 to the
   focus containing a Join header which contains the dialog identifier
   A-F.  Bob is added into the conference by the focus.

5.9  Replaces Header Field: Switching User Agents within a Conference

   A participant in a conference may want to change the user agent (i.e.
   the endpoint or the device) with which they participate in the
   conference.  While this could be done by simply sending a BYE from
   one user agent to leave the conference and an INVITE from the other
   user agent to rejoin.  However, the SIP Replaces [6] primitive is
   perfectly suited to this operation.

   An example is shown in Figure 9.  It is assumed that Alice is a
   participant of the conference using user agent #1.  The dialog
   identifier between Alice's user agent #1 and the focus is abbreviated
   as A-F.  Alice switches to user agent #2 and sends an INVITE message
   F1 to the focus containing a Replaces header which contains the
   dialog identifier A-F.  Note that this dialog identifier could be
   learned through some non-SIP mechanism, or by use of SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY
   and the dialog event package [19].  Alice's user agent #2 is added
   into the conference by the focus.  The focus sends a BYE to user
   agent #1.  User agent #1 then automatically terminates the
   subscription by sending a SUBSCRIBE with Expires:0 to terminate the
   subscription.  Note that the participant list (roster) has not
   necessarily changed during this scenario, unless detailed information
   about participant's user agents (i.e. endpoints) is included in the
   conference state notifications.  For a full discussion of conference
   package notifications, refer to [9].

5.10  Replaces Header Field: Transferring a Point-to-Point Session into
      a Conference

   This call flow shows how a point to point call can be transferred to
   a conference call involving an external focus.

   Alice and Bob have an established session with a dialog identifier
   A-B.  Alice joins the conference with the focus by sending an INVITE
   to the Conference URI.  Alice then sends a REFER request to the focus
   to send an INVITE request to the other participant.  Alice includes

   an escaped Replaces header field in the URI included in the Refer-To
   header field.  Bob receives the INVITE from the focus, matches the
   dialog in the Replaces header field with the dialog with Alice.  As a
   result, Bob accepts the INVITE, joins the conference, and sends a BYE
   to Alice to tear down their point to point dialog.

   Figure 10. Transitioning a Point to Point Session into a Conference.


5.11  REFER with BYE: Requesting a Focus Remove a Participant from a
      Conference

   To request the focus remove a participant from the specified
   conference, a properly authorized SIP UA (typically the conference
   owner) can send a REFER to the conference URI with a Refer-To
   containing the URI of the participant and with the method set to BYE.
   The requestor does not need to know the dialog information about the
   dialog between the focus and the participant who will be removed -
   the focus knows this information and fills it when it generates the
   BYE request.

   An example call flow is shown in Figure 11.  It is assumed that Alice
   and Carol are already participants of the conference and that Alice
   is authorized to remove members from the conference.  Alice sends a
   REFER to the conference URI with a Refer-To header containing a URI
   of the form sip:carol@chicago.example.com;method=BYE.

5.12  Deleting a Conference

   The default conference policy for conferences created using the
   Conference Factory URI is that the conference is deleted when the
   creator departs.

   Figure 12 shows this call flow in which the creator Alice departs
   causing the conference to be deleted.  Note that the order of sending
   BYEs and final NOTIFYs is not important.

5.13  Discovery of URI Properties using OPTIONS

   A UA MAY send an OPTIONS request to discover if an opaque URI is a
   conference URI (resolves to a focus).  In addition, the reply to the
   OPTIONS request can also indicate support for various SIP call
   control extensions used in this document.

   Note that the Allow, Accept, Allow-Events, and Supported header
   fields should be present in an INVITE from a focus or a 200 OK answer
   from the focus to an INVITE as a part of a normal dialog
   establishment process.

   An example is shown in Figure 13 where Alice sends an OPTIONS to a
   URI which resolves to a focus.

   sections.

   Allow.  The support of methods such as REFER, SUBSCRIBE, and NOTIFY
   indicate that the user agent supports call control and SIP Events.

   Accept.  The support of bodies such as message/sipfrag [12],
   application/conference-info+xml [9] also indicates support of call
   control and conferencing.

   Allow-Events.  The support of event packages such as refer [4],
   conference [9].

   Supported.  The support of extensions such as replaces, join, and
   gruu.

   Contact.  The presence of the 'isfocus' feature parameter in the
   Contact header indicates that the URI is a conference URI and that
   the UA is a focus.

6.  Security Considerations

   This specification defines the interaction between a focus UA and a
   participant UA in a conferencing application.  As a result, the
   security considerations and mechanisms defined in RFC 3261 [2] apply.
   However, there are some aspects unique to conferencing which will be
   discussed here.

   A conference often involves the use of substantial network bandwidth
   and computing resources.  As a result, authentication is even more
   important than in a simple peer to peer session.  As discussed in the
   conferencing framework [8], conferences often have policy related to
   conferencing resources.  A focus SHOULD authenticate participants
   before joining them to a conference and allowing utilization of
   conferencing resources.  Different policies can be applied by a focus
   to different participants based on the result of authentication.

   A participant will be interacting with a number of other participants
   through the focus.  As a result, a participant should authenticate
   the focus and be sure that the focus used for the conference is
   trusted.  Normal SIP authentication mechanisms are suitable for
   participant and focus authentication, such as SIP Digest utilizing a
   shared secret, or certificates, or a secured SIP identity mechanism.
   In addition, a focus SHOULD support Secure SIP connections so that
   hop by hop mutual authentication and confidentiality provided by TLS
   can be achieved.

   In the SIP dialog between them, a focus utilizes the 'isfocus'
   feature tag to indicate that the UA is acting as a focus.  As such,



Johnston & Levin        Expires December 5, 2005               [Page 36]

Internet-Draft         SIP CC Conferencing for UAs             June 2005


   the SIP header fields such as Contact SHOULD have end to end
   integrity.  A participant and focus SHOULD support an end to end
   integrity mechanism such as S/MIME.

   Once a participant has learned that the other UA is a focus, SIP call
   control operations (such as REFER) can be implemented, or a
   subscription to the conference package of the focus might be
   attempted.  The security considerations described in RFC 3515 [4]
   apply to any REFER call control operations.  A focus and participant
   will apply policy to determine which call control operations are
   allowed.

   A focus accepting subscriptions to the conference package must follow
   the security considerations in RFC XXXX [9].  Since notifications can
   carry sensitive information, the subscriptions should be
   authenticated and the notifications delivered with confidentiality
   and integrity protection.  Since a participant is not able to
   authenticate other participants directly, a participant must rely on
   the focus to perform this authentication.

   A focus MUST support a participant's request for privacy, either
   through conference policy or as expressed through the signaling.  For
   example, a participant joining a conference and including a Privacy
   header field [10] must not have identity information revealed to
   other participants by the focus.  If other signaling protocols are
   used, privacy signaled through them also must be respected.

8.  Appendix - Creating a Conference by a Conference-Unaware UA

   This section discusses how a human user operating a conference-
   unaware UA can create and add participants to a conference.  This
   method is described as an appendix since it is NOT RECOMMENDED.  The
   scenarios involving creating a conference using ad-hoc or manual
   means are recommended over this scenario.  This scenario is included,
   however, for completeness.

   A user (human) would choose a conference URI according to system
   rules and insert it into the Request-URI of the INVITE.  This same
   URI is echoed by a focus adhering to certain addressing conventions



Johnston & Levin        Expires December 5, 2005               [Page 37]

Internet-Draft         SIP CC Conferencing for UAs             June 2005


   (discussed below) in the Contact header by the focus.  Additional
   participants could be added by non-SIP means (publication of the
   chosen conference URI using web pages, email, IM, etc.).
   Alternatively, the conference-unaware UA could then add other
   participants to the conference using SIP call control by establishing
   a session with them, then transferring [18] them to the conference
   URI.  Note that in this scenario only the user (human) is aware of
   the conferencing application, and the conference-unaware UA only need
   support RFC 3261 [2] and optionally call transfer.

   Making this work does impose certain addressing conventions on a
   system.  As a service/implementation choice, a system could allow the
   creator of the conference to choose the user portion of the
   conference URI.  However, this requires the URI format to be agreed
   upon between a user and the system.

   For example, a service provider might reserve the domain
   conf.example.com for all conference URIs.  Any URI in the domain of
   conf.example.com would resolve to the focus.  The focus could be
   configured to interpret an unknown user part in the conf.example.com
   domain as a request for a conference to be created with the
   conference URI as the Request-URI.  For example, an INVITE sent with
   a Request-URI of sip:k32934208ds72@conf.example.com could be routed
   to the focus that would then create the conference.  This conference
   URI should be registered by the newly created focus to become
   routable as a conference URI within the conf.example.com domain.  The
   returned Contact would look as follows:

        Contact: <sip:k32934208ds72@conf.example.com>;isfocus

   Note, however, that this approach relies on conventions adopted
   between the user (human) and the focus.  Also, the approach is not
   robust against collisions in the conference names.  If a second user
   wishing to create a new conference happened to choose the same user
   part as an existing conference, the result would be that the second
   user would be added into the existing conference instead of creating
   a new one.

   As a result, methods of conference creation in which the conference
   URI is an opaque URI generated by the focus are preferred.

   An example call flow is shown in Figure 14.  The participant Alice
   creates the conference URI (using some convention agreed to with the
   focus domain) and sends an INVITE to that URI which creates the
   focus.  The focus creates the conference and returns the same
   conference URI in the 200 OK answer to the INVITE (which is ignored
   by the conference-unaware UA).
