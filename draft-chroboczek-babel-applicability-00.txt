1.  Introduction

   Babel [RFC6126] is a loop-avoiding distance-vector routing protocol
   that aims to be robust in a variety of environments.

   This document describes a few areas where Babel has been found
   useful.  It is structured as follows.  In Section 2, we describe
   application areas where Babel has been successfully deployed.  In
   Section 3, we describe application areas where Babel has not been
   deployed, but is likely to work well.  In Section 4, we describe
   application areas where deployment of Babel is not recommended
   because better alternatives are available.

2.  Existing deployments of Babel

2.1.  Hybrid networks

   Babel is able to deal with both classical, prefix-based ("Internet-
   style") routing and flat ("mesh-style") routing.  Because of that, it
   has seen a number of succesful deployments in medium-sized hybrid
   networks, networks that combine a wired, aggregated backbone with
   meshy wireless bits.  No other routing protocol known to us is
   similarly robust and efficient in this particular type of network.

2.2.  Large scale overlay networks

   The algorithms used by Babel allow it to remain relatively stable in
   the presence of unstable metrics, even in the presence of a feedback
   loop.  For this reason, it has been successfully deployed in large
   scale overlay networks, built out of thousands of tunnels spanning
   continents, where it is used with a metric computed from links'
   latencies [DELAY-BASED].

2.3.  Small unmanaged networks

   Because of its small size and simple configuration, Babel has been
   deployed in small, unmanaged networks (three to five routers), where
   it serves as a more efficient replacement for RIP [RFC2453].

3.  Potential deployments of Babel

   There are a number of areas where Babel has not seen much deployment
   yet, but where we expect it to be applicable.

3.1.  Pure mesh networks

   Babel is able to deal with pure wireless mesh networks.  However,
   this particular niche is well served by a number of mature protocols,
   notably OLSR-ETX and OLSRv2 [RFC7181] with the DAT metric [DAT].

4.  Application Areas where Babel is not recommended

   There are a number of application areas where Babel is a poor fit.

4.1.  Large, stable networks

   Babel relies on periodic updates, and even in a stable network, it
   generates a constant amount of background traffic.  In large, stable,
   well-administered networks, it is preferable to use protocols layered
   above a reliable transport mechanism, such as OSPF [RFC5340], EIGRP
   [EIGRP] or IS-IS [RFC1195].

4.2.  Low-power networks

   Babel relies on periodic updates and maintains within each node an
   amount of state that is proportional to the number of reachable
   destinations.  In networks containing resource-constrained or
   exteremely low-power nodes, it may be preferable to use a protocol
   that limits the amount of state maintained and propagated; we have
   heard of AODVv2 [AODVv2], RPL [RFC6550] and LOADng [LOADng].
