Abstract

   A Universally Traceable Identifier (UTID) is a compact string of
   characters for identifying an abstract or physical object. A unique
   feature of UTID is that it contains two types of forwarding messages
   to achieve traceability. UTIDs are designed specially for Identifier
   Tracing Protocol (ITDP) [I-D-IDTP].

   This document defines the generic syntax of UTID, a generative
   grammar for UTID, and the guidelines for their use, too.

1. Introduction

   A Universal Traceable Identifier (UTID) provides a simple and
   extensible means for identifying an abstract object and a physical
   object. This specification of UTID syntax and semantic is derived
   from concepts introduced by the Identifier Tracing Protocol (IDTP)
   [I-D-IDTP], which is a communication protocol designed for tracing
   an object and is initially presented in a reference [Huang2011]. The
   syntax and semantic of UTID is designed to meet the requirements
   needed for the operating of IDTP.

   Note 1: This version of this document has an important change
   compare to the previous version. The major change is the syntax of
   UTID which has many influences on this document and IDTP protocol
   [I-D-IDTP].

   Note 2: A reference implementation, which is called "busilet", of
   UTID and IDTP has been developed as open source software and could
   be downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/busilet/. For
   more information please visit http://www.utid.org.

1.1. Overview of UTIDs

   UTIDs are characterized as follows:

Internet-Draft                  UTID                     November 2014


   o Universality: Universality provides several benefits. It allows
      UTIDs to be used for different types of objects in various
      contexts with same syntax. It allows UTIDs to be compatible with
      preexisting identifiers defined in various existing
      identification system.

   o Traceability: UTIDs contain forwarding messages used by IDTP [I-
      D-IDTP] to trace the origin of the information associated to the
      objects identified by the UTIDs. There two types of forwarding
      messages contained in UTID used by IDTP. This is a unique feature
      of UTIDs and IDTP comparing to URIs and other communication
      protocol. This is why a new identification system and
      communication protocol are proposed.

   o Identifier: An identifier embodies the information required to
      distinguish what is being identified from all other objects
      within its scope of identification.

   A UTID is an identifier consisting of a sequence of characters
   matching the syntax rule named <UTID> in Section 5.1.  This
   specification does not place any limits on the nature of an object.
   UTIDs have a global scope and are interpreted consistently
   regardless of context.

1.2. Terminology

   This specification uses a number of terms related to UTID for
   understanding the concept of UTID.

   o Traceability: It refers to the ability to trace the history,
      application or location of an entity by means of recorded
      identifications [ISO8402]. The concept of entity in this document
      is extended to abstract objects and physical objects.

   o Object: It is refer to an abstract object or a physical object in
      this document.

   o IDTP: It is Identifier Tracing Protocol, as defined in reference
      [I-D-IDTP]. UTIDs are designed specially for IDTP.

   o UTID suffix: It is the last part of a UTID starting from a given
      position.

   o Tracing: It is the process to trace a request to its origin
      server by forwarding the request. It is a special kind of
      forwarding for the purpose of traceability.

1.3. UTIDs and URIs

   A UTID is similar to Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) defined by
   RFC3986 [RFC3986]. URIs are uniform identifiers for general purposes.
   UTIDs defined in this document are universal identifiers for IDTP
   only. Their differences are as follows:

   1. Traceability: A UTID contains two types of forwarding messages to
      achieve traceability.

   2. Syntax: The syntax is different from URIs. There are no percent-
      encoding characters used to represent predefined delimiters in
      components in UTIDs.

   3. Nested: A UTID can nest another UTID as its component, even with
      two or three nested levels, as long as the whole UTID is not
      longer than 96 characters.

   4. Usage: URIs are uniform identifiers for general purposes, while
      UTIDs are universal identifiers designed for IDTP only.

   UTIDs are not compatible with URIs because of the differences
   described above. Therefore, UTIDs could not become a scheme under
   URIs scheme architecture.

2. Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.

   This specification uses the terms "character" in accordance with the
   definitions provided in [BCP19].

3. Characters

   A UTID is composed from a set of characters consisting of digits,
   letters, and graphic symbols. A reserved subset of those characters
   may be used to delimit syntax components within a UTID while the
   remaining characters, including both the unreserved set and those
   reserved characters not acting as delimiters, define each
   component's identifying data.

Internet-Draft                  UTID                     November 2014


3.1. Reserved Characters

   UTIDs include components that are delimited by characters in the
   "reserved" set. These characters are called "reserved" because they
   are defined as delimiters by the UTID syntax.

       reserved  =  "~" / "$"

3.2. Unreserved Characters

   Characters that are allowed in a UTID but do not have a reserved
   purpose are called unreserved. These include lowercase letters,
   decimal digits, hyphen, and period.

       unreserved  = alpha / DIGIT / "-" / "."

       alpha    =  %x61-7A   ; a-z

4. Syntax Components

   A UTID consists of three components referred to as the dns, catalog,
   and id.

4.1. Dns

   A dns component is the domain name in Domain Name System (DNS)
   defined by RFC1034 and RFC1035 [RFC1034] [RFC1035] for who defines
   the UTID and assigns the UTID to an object. It is required and MUST
   NOT be empty (no characters).

   The dns expresses one type of forwarding message of a UTID, which is
   used directly by the TCP/IP network.

4.2. Catalog

   There might be various ids in a dns of an organization. These ids
   should be grouped into some catalogs. A catalog component expresses
   the catalog message of the object identified by a UTID. It is not
   required and may be empty (no characters).

   The catalog message is used by IDTP to map a UTID to a set of data
   format standard for communication, as defined in Section 6.2 of
   reference [I-D-IDTP].

Internet-Draft                  UTID                     November 2014


4.3. Id

   An id component is a string of characters for identifying an object.
   It MUST be unique in the context defined by the catalog and dns
   components. It may be a serial number, a unique string with meaning,
   such as user name, or a unique number or string generated by machine.
   It is not required but usually is not empty.

5. Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC-5234 [RFC5234].

5.1. UTID Syntax

   The UTID Syntax is as follows:

        UTID  =  [ id ] "~" [ catalog ] "$" dns

           id         =  1 * 92 graphic

           catalog    =  label 0 * 30 dot-label 0 * 1 label

           dns        =  label 0 * 60 dot-label "." 2 * 7 alpha

           label      =  alpha / DIGIT

           dot-label  =  alpha / DIGIT / "-" / "."

           alpha      =  %x61-7A   ; a-z

           graphic    =  %x21-7E / Graphic Unicode character

   If one component (catalog) is empty, the delimiter ('~') before the
   component SHOULD NOT be omitted.

5.1.1. Maximum Length of UTIDs

   The maximum length of a UTID is 96 bytes including all delimiters in
   the UTID although the sum of the maximum length of each components
   is larger than 96. If one component is long, the other components
   should be short to guarantee that the length of a UTID does not
   exceed 96 bytes.

Internet-Draft                  UTID                     November 2014


5.1.2. Dns

   The dns component MUST be a real DNS name registered in a domain
   name registration agent and MUST NOT be an IP address or "localhost"
   that is a loopback name of local machine. That is to say, there must
   be at least one dot '.' in the dns component and the part after the
   last dot must be a top-level domain.

   The Domain Name System (DNS) [RFC1034] [RFC1035] defines the maximum
   length of a DNS is 255. However, to simplify implementations, the
   maximum length of a DNS used in UTID is limited to 64, which is
   longer than nearly all DNS actually used in real world.

   In the DNS definition, characters used in DNS may be lower case or
   upper case without any significance attached to the case. However,
   to simplify implementations, the characters used in dns component in
   UTID MUST be lower case.

   The Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) system
   allows user applications, such as web browsers, map Unicode strings
   into the valid DNS character set using Punycode, which is called
   internationalized domain names. However, to simplify implementations,
   internationalized domain names are not allowed in UTIDs.

5.1.3. Catalog

   The catalog component consists of lowercase letters, decimal digits,
   hyphen, and period only. A hyphen and a period should not be in the
   beginning and ending position of the catalog component.

5.1.4. Id

   Like catalog component, the id component consists of lowercase
   letters, decimal digits, hyphen, and period. A hyphen and a period
   should not be in the beginning and ending position of the catalog
   component.

   However, for the best compatibility, the id component may consists
   of graphic characters, which include all graphic characters defined
   in ISO/IEC 646 [ISO646] and all graphic characters defined in
   Unicode [Unicode] except white space. The Unicode character SHOULD
   be encoded in UTF-8 [STD63] character set.

   The id component is case sensitive, while the catalog and dns
   components support lower case only.

Internet-Draft                  UTID                     November 2014


   It is recommended that id component use lowercase letters, decimal
   digits, hyphen, and period only. The graphic characters are used
   only for compatibility to existing code system purpose.

   Space ('%x20') or any character less than %x20 is neither supported
   by id component nor supported by the catalog and dns components in
   UTIDs.

5.1.5. Nested UTID

   A nested UTID is defined as the id component of a UTID is another
   UTID. Therefore, the id component of a nested UTID MUST contain dns
   component and follow the UTID syntax. On the contrary, a UTID in
   which id component contains dns component is not necessary to be a
   nested UTID. Whether a UTID is a nested UTID is determined both by
   the syntax and the usage context of the UTID.

5.2. Reserved catalog

   Some catalogs are reserved for future use. These catalogs include
   'u', 'v' ,'w', 'x', 'y', and 'z', and all catalogs that end with
   '.u', '.v' ,'.w', '.x', '.y', and '.z'.

5.3. Examples

   Examples of UTIDs are as follows:

           123~cat$abc.example

           123~$abc.example

           ~cat$abc.example

           ~$abc.example

   Examples of nested UTIDs are as follows:

           123~cat$abc.example~log$zyx.example

           123~cat$abc.example~$zyx.example

           123~$abc.example~log$zyx.example

           ~$abc.example~$zyx.example

   Examples of invalid UTIDs are as follows:

Internet-Draft                  UTID                     November 2014


           123$abc.example

   There is no ~ symbol in the string so that the 123 in the string is
   ambiguous as id or catalog.

           123~abc.example

   There is no $ symbol in the string so that no dns could be defined.

           cat$abc.example

   There is no ~ symbol in the string.

           $abc.example

   There is no ~ symbol in the string.

           123~abc$abcexample

   The dns component is not a valid DNS.

           123~abc$ABC.example

   The dns component has a upper case letter.

   Examples of invalid nested UTIDs are as follows:

           123~$abc~$zyx.example

   The is component is not a valid UTID because "abc" is not a valid
   dns.

           123~$abc.com$zyx.example

           123$abc.test~$zyx.example

6. Usage

   A UTID should be used as a whole. There is no concept such as
   relative reference in URIs.

   One or more components of UTIDs may be omitted (emppty), which are
   discussed in following.

Internet-Draft                  UTID                     November 2014


6.1. Components Omitted

6.1.1. Catalog Omitted

   The catalog component is used to map a UTID to a set of data format
   standard for communication by IDTP.

   If the catalog component is omitted, it means that default catalog
   is used. The default catalog of a UTID is an empty string with
   length of zero. There is always a catalog in a UTID in spite of
   catalog component omitted or not, either explicitly defined by
   catalog component in a UTID or implicitly defined by default catalog
   of empty string.

6.1.2. Id Omitted

   The id component is scarcely omitted. The id component may be
   omitted in the following two cases:

   o A UTID identifies all objects in the catalog specified in the
      UTID.

   o It does not concern the object that a UTID identifies. Therefore,
      the UTID is used only as forwarding messages by IDTP.

6.1.3. Dns Only

   Occasionally, a UTID consists of only dns component without id and
   catalog components. In this case, both delimiter '~' and '$' SHOULD
   NOT be omitted, catalog component is the default catalog of empty
   string, and the id components are not the concerns.

   The UTID of dns only is used only as forwarding messages by IDTP,
   that is, the UTID refers to the origin server referred by dns only.

6.2. Without Dns

   A UTID without dns component is invalid. However, UTIDs without dns
   component may exist in some special usage context. Such UTIDs are
   strictly limited to the interior of server and MUST NOT be
   transmitted in communications.

   For example, UTIDs are used as primary key in a database, which is a
   typical usage of UTIDs. In this case, all the primary key values
   have same dns component or even same catalog components. Therefore,
   the redundant components are not necessary to be saved in the

Internet-Draft                  UTID                     November 2014


   database and a mechanism of mapping primary key to UTID should be
   established in the interior of server.

6.3. Spaces

   Space ('%x20') or any character less than %x20 is neither supported
   in id component nor the catalog and dns components in UTIDs.

   It is acceptable for catalog components without supporting of space
   character. However, it is occasionally happens that spaces character
   occur in an id in existing identification system. In this case, the
   spaces character should be replaced by some other visible characters
   for compatibility, which is not defined in this document.

6.4. Carrier of UTIDs

   UTIDs may be used in RFID or two dimension bar code as tags to
   identify physical objects. UTIDs may also be used in a database as
   primary keys or foreign keys to identify physical or abstract
   objects. In such cases, the length of UTIDs is critical especially
   in RFID and the data structure design of databases. To simplify
   implementations, the maximum length of UTIDs is limited to 96 bytes.

   If a UTID is used as a primary key in a database, the primary key
   values usually are saved without dns component, or even without
   catalog components and there should be a mechanism to convert the
   primary keys to UTIDs in the server interior.

   If a UTID is used as a foreign key in a database, the foreign key
   values must be saved as whole UTIDs following the syntax of UTIDs.
   There is no strict foreign key constraint to the referenced table.
   In this case, the foreign key in a table usually refers to many
   referenced tables distributed in many databases in local or remote
   hosts, which are defined in the forwarding messages (dns and catalog
   components) of UTIDs of foreign key values.

6.5. Use of UTID

   The UTID may be used to identify any physical or conceptual thing in
   the real world or conceptual world. For example, an UTID of
   "101.room102~sensor$sample.test" indicate a sensor with number of
   101 at room 102 in sample.test company.

   The UTID is also compatible with existing code system. For example,
   an ISBN of a book "9787111316275" may be coded in UTID as

   "9787111316275~isbn$id.cmpbook.com", where cmpbook.com is the
   publisher of the book.

   Another example is email address. An email of "test@gmail.com" may
   be coded in UTID as "test@gmail.com~email$example.com".

   A UTID can be read as "id of catalog in dns". For example, The UTID
   "101~sensor$sample.test" can be read as "101 of sensor in
   sample.test".

7. Normalization and Comparison

   One of the most common operations on UTIDs is comparison to
   determine whether two UTIDs are equivalent. All UTIDs are already
   normalized so that the comparison of two UTIDs is case sensitive
   comparison of them.

8. Security Considerations

   This section is meant to inform application developers, information
   providers, and users of the security limitations of UTID as
   described by this document. The discussion does not include
   definitive solutions to the problems revealed, though it does make
   some suggestions for reducing security risks.

   Although a UTID does not in itself pose a security threat, but a
   UTID is in plaintext transmitted over network without encryption.
   Hence it exposes to any network sniffer tools and results in the
   unintentional leakage of this information during the transferring
   over network. There are some potential risks if id or catalog
   components contain sensitive information. Therefore, it should be
   careful to design the UTID components to avoid leakage of sensitive
   information.

9. IANA Considerations

   No IANA actions are required by this document.

10. Change log of this document

   draft-huangng-utid-01: Add two links to the web site of reference
   implementation of UTID and IDTP and official web site of UTID and
   IDTP in the section "1. Introduction".

   draft-huangng-utid-02: Add a section titled "6.5. Use of UTID"

   draft-huangng-utid-03: There is an important change. The syntax of
   UTID is changed from id~cat@loc$dns to id~cat$dns. It causes many
   changes in this document.

   draft-huangng-utid-04: (1) No changes; (2) Just make the ID active.

Appendix A.                 Parsing a UTID with a Regular Expression

   The following line is the regular expression for breaking-down a
   UTID into its components.

   ^([\u0021-\u007e\u0080-\uffff]{1,92})?~([a-z0-9][a-z0-9\-
   \.]{0,30}[a-z0-9]?)?\$([a-z0-9][a-z0-9\-\.]{0,60}\.[a-z]{2,7})$

   For example, matching the above expression to

           123~cat$abc.example

   results in the following sub expression matches:

           $0 = 123~cat$abc.example

           $1 = 123

           $2 = cat

           $3 = abc.example

   Therefore, it can be determined that the three components are as
   follows:

           id       = $1

           catalog  = $2

           dns      = $3

   When above regular expression is used, any string that does not have
   delimiters of '~' and '$' will cause an exception.

Appendix B.                 Delimiting a UTID in Context

   UTIDs are usually transmitted through formats that provide a clear
   context for their interpretation. However, it is important to be
   able to delimit the UTID from the rest of the text if a UTID is in a
   plain text file for printing or transmitting. In such case, UTIDs
   are delimited by double-quotes is recommended. For example,
   "123$abc.example" is a UTID.
