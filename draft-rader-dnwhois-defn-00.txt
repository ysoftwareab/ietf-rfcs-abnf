1. Abstract 
    
   Efforts are currently being undertaken to review the role of Whois 
   (as defined in RFC 954 [2] and formalize registry/registrar 
   communications protocols in light of the current and evolving scope 
   and utility of DNS, domain name registries and related entities. In 
   order for this work to be truly effective and broadly applicable, it 
   is important that accepted definitions act as the foundation. This 
   document is an attempt to create a starting point for the requisite 
   dialogue that will ultimately foster the determination and 
   acceptance of these definitions.  
    
    
2. Conventions used in this document 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3]. 
    
    
3. Definitions 
    
   Contact: Contacts are individuals or entities associated with domain 
   name records. Typically, third parties with specific inquiries or 
   concerns will use contact records to determine who should act upon

   specific issues related to a domain name record. There are typically 
   three of these contact types associated with a domain name record, 
   the Administrative contact, the Billing contact and the Technical 
   contact.  
     
   Contact, Administrative: The administrative contact is an 
   individual, role or organization authorized to interact with the 
   registry or registrar on behalf of the SLD Holder. The 
   administrative contact should be able to answer non-technical 
   questions about the domain name's registration and the SLD Holder. 
   In all cases, the Administrative Contact is viewed as the 
   authoritative point of contact for the domain name, second only to 
   the Registrant. 
         
   Contact, Billing: The billing contact is the individual, role or 
   organization designated to receive the invoice for domain name 
   registration and re-registration fees. 
         
   Contact, Technical: The technical contact is the individual, role or 
   organization who is responsible for the technical operations of the 
   delegated zone. This contact likely maintains the domain name 
   server(s) for the domain. The technical contact should be able to 
   answer technical questions about the domain name, the delegated zone 
   and work with technically oriented people in other zones to solve 
   technical problems that affect the domain name and/or zone. 
    
   Domain Holder: The individual or organization that registers a 
   specific domain name. This individual or organization holds the 
   right to use that specific domain name for a specified period of 
   time, provided certain conditions are met and the registration fees 
   are paid. This person or organization is the "legal entity" bound by 
   the terms of the relevant service agreement with the registry 
   operator for the TLD in question. 
    
   NIC: Network Information Center. 
    
   ICANN: Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. A non-
   profit organization founded to assume responsibility for IP address 
   space assignment, protocol parameter assignment, domain name system 
   management and root server system management. 
         
   InterNIC: The InterNIC, a registered service mark of the U.S. 
   Department of Commerce, is a concept for an integrated network 
   information center that was developed by several companies, 
   including Network Solutions, in cooperation with the U.S. 
   Government. Until recently, the term InterNIC is being used in 
   conjunction with a neutral, stand alone web page (located at 
   http://www.internic.net) that has been established to provide the 
   public with information regarding Internet domain name registration. 
   ICANN has recently undertaken an agreement with the United States 
   Department of Commerce to undertake operation of the effort. The 
   InterNIC was originally created by NSF to provide specific Internet

   services; directory & database services (by AT&T), registration 
   services (by Network Solutions) and information services (by General 
   Atomics/CERFnet). [4] 
    
   NIC Handle: A NIC Handle is an identifier in use by some registrars 
   and registries that is assigned to various records in the domain 
   name database. Globally, they do not have a common format or 
   application. Further, they are not globally unique. 
    
   Registrant: See Domain Holder 
    
   Registrar: A person or entity that contracts with SLD holders and a 
   registry, collecting registration data about the SLD holders and 
   submitting zone file information for entry in the registry database. 
    
   Registry: A Registry is the person(s) or entity(ies) responsible for 
   providing registry services. Registry services include customer 
   database administration, zone file publication, DNS operation, 
   marketing and policy determination in accordance with the general 
   principles outlined in RFC 1591 [5]. A Registry may outsource some, 
   all, or none of these services. 
    
   Registry Operator: Usually synonymous with the term Registry, 
   however a Registry Operator may also be an organization or 
   individual acting operating the Registry under an outsourced 
   technical services management contract. 
    
   SLD: An "SLD" is a second-level domain of the DNS 
    
   SLD Holder: The individual or organization that registers a specific 
   domain name. This individual or organization holds the right to use 
   that specific domain name for a specified period of time, provided 
   certain conditions are met and the registration fees are paid. This 
   person or organization is the "legal entity" bound by the terms of 
   the relevant service agreement with the registry operator for the 
   TLD in question. 
         
   SLD Sponsor: The Registrar responsible for the submission of the 
   domain name to the Registry.  
    
   Whois: a TCP transaction based query/response server, that providing 
   netwide directory service to network users. Originally defined in 
   RFC 954, the earlier implementations were centralized systems run 
   first by SRC-NIC and then later InterNIC/Network Solutions. The SRI-
   NIC and InterNIC implementations are more formally referred to as 
   "NICNAME/Whois" services. Whois is not purely a domain name or IP 
   address directory service, but has been deployed for a wide variety 
   of uses, both public and private. Other variants of this service 
   include RWhois and the newer Verisign Referral LDAP Whois service. 
    
   Whois, Bulk: A data retrieval mechanism required by ICANN that 
   specifies that all ICANN accredited Registrars must make their Whois

   dataset available as a single machine readable file. Put another 
   way, Bulk Whois is the entire Registrar Whois dataset available for 
   download via FTP, HTTP or other mechanism. 
         
   Whois, Command-line: A Whois query executed from the command line of 
   an operating system such as Linux or MS-DOS. 
    
   Whois Record: The information or payload returned to the client as a 
   result of a Whois query. 
         
   Whois, Referral: RWhois (Referral Whois) extends and enhances the 
   Whois concept in a hierarchical and scaleable fashion. In accordance 
   with this, RWhois focuses primarily on the distribution of "network 
   objects", or the data representing Internet resources or people, and 
   uses the inherently hierarchical nature of these network objects 
   (domain names, Internet Protocol (IP) networks, email addresses) to 
   more accurately discover the requested information. [6] 
         
   Whois, Registrar: Whois services made available by specific 
   registrars for the domain names that they sponsor at the Registry. 
         
   Whois, Registry: Whois services made available by specific 
   registries for the domain names that they are authoritative for. 
   Registry Whois often do not provide the comprehensive contact 
   information that Registrar Whois services do, but they usually 
   contain contact information for the Sponsoring Registrar. 
         
   Whois, Web based: A World Wide Web interface to Registrar or 
   Registry Whois services.
