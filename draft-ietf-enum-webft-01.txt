2.  Introduction

   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, RFC3761 [3]) is a system that transforms
   E.164 numbers [4] into domain names and then uses DNS (Domain Name
   Service, RFC1034 [5]) services like delegation through NS records and
   NAPTR records to look up what services are available for a specific
   domain name.

   This document registers 'ENUMservices' according to the guidelines
   given in RFC3761 to be used for provisioning in the services field of
   a NAPTR [8] resource record to indicate what class of functionality a
   given end point offers. The registration is defined within the DDDS
   (Dynamic Delegation Discovery System [6][7][8][9][10]) hierarchy, for
   use with the "E2U" DDDS Application defined in RFC3761.

   The following 'ENUMservices' are registered with this document: 'web'
   and 'ft'. These share a common feature in that they each indicate
   that the functionality of the given end points and the associated
   resources are primarily sources of information.

   According to RFC2619bis, the 'ENUMservice' registered must be able to
   function as a selection mechanism when choosing one NAPTR resource
   record from another. That means that the registration MUST specify
   what is expected when using that very NAPTR record, and the URI
   scheme which is the outcome of the use of it.

   Therefore an 'ENUMservice' acts as a hint, indicating the kind of
   service with which the URI constructed using the regexp field is
   associated. There can be more than one 'ENUMservice' included within
   a single NAPTR; this indicates that there is more than one service
   that can be achieved using the associated URI scheme.

   The common thread with this set of definitions is that they reflect
   the kind of service that the end user will hope to achieve with the
   communication using the associated URI.

   The services specified here are intended NOT to specify the protocol
   or even method of connection that MUST be used to achieve each
   service. Instead they define the kind of interactive behavior that an
   end user will expect, leaving the end system to decide (based on
   policies outside the remit of this specification) how to execute the
   service.

   Since the same URI scheme may be used for different services (e.g.
   'tel:'), and the same kind of service may use different URI schemes
   (e.g. for VoIP 'sip:', 'h323:' and 'tel:' may be used), it is
   necessary in some cases to specify the service and the URI scheme
   used.

   The service parameters defined in RFC3761 allow therefore a 'type'
   and a 'subtype' to be specified. Within this set of specifications
   the convention is assumed that the 'type' (being the more generic
   term) is defining the service and the 'subtype' is defining the URI
   scheme.

3.  Web Service

3.1  Introduction

   The ENUMservices registered in this section indicate that the
   resource identified by the associated URI is capable of being a
   source of information.

3.2  Web Service Registration with 'http:'

   Enumservice Name: "web"

   Enumservice Type: "web"

   Enumservice Subtype: "http"

   URI Scheme: 'http:'

   Functional Specification:

   This ENUMservice indicates that the resource identified by the
   associated URI scheme is capable of being a source of information.

   It has to be noted that the kind of information retrieved can be
   manifold. Usually, contacting a resource by an 'http:' URI provides a
   document. This document can contain references that will trigger
   download of many different kinds of information, like audio or video or
   executable code. Thus, one can not be more specific about the kind of
   information that can be expected when contacting the resource.

   Security Considerations:

   There are no specific security issues with this 'ENUMservice'.
   However, the general considerations of Section 5 apply.

   Intended Usage: COMMON

   detail see Authors' Addresses section)

3.3  Web Service Registration with 'https:'

   Enumservice Name: "web"

   Enumservice Type: "web"

   Enumservice Subtype: "https"

   URI Scheme: 'https:'

   Functional Specification:

   This ENUMservice indicates that the resource identified by the
   associated URI scheme is capable of being a source of information,
   which can be contacted by using TLS or Secure Socket Layer protocol.

   It has to be noted that the kind of information retrieved can be
   manifold. Usually, contacting a resource by an 'https:' URI provides
   a document. This document can contain all different kind of
   information, like audio or video or executable code. Thus, one can
   not be more specific what information to expect when contacting the
   resource.

   Security Considerations:

   There are no specific security issues with this 'ENUMservice'.
   However, the general considerations of Section 5 apply.

   Intended Usage: COMMON

4.  FT Service Registration

   Enumservice Name: "ft"

   Enumservice Type: "ft"

   Enumservice Subtype: "ftp"

   URI Scheme: 'ftp:'

   Functional Specification:

   This ENUMservice indicates that the resource identified by the
   associated URI scheme is a file service from which a file or file
   listing can be retrieved.

   Security Considerations:

   There are no specific security issues with this 'ENUMservice'.
   However, the general considerations of Section 5 apply.

   Intended Usage: COMMON

5.  Security Considerations

   DNS, as used by ENUM, is a global, distributed database. Thus any
   information stored there is visible to anyone anonymously. Whilst
   this is not qualitatively different from publication in a Telephone
   Directory, it does open the data subject to having "their"
   information collected automatically without any indication that this
   has been done or by whom.

   Such data harvesting by third parties is often used to generate lists
   of targets for unrequested information; in short, they are used to
   address "spam". Anyone who uses a Web-archived mailing list is aware
   that the volume of "spam" email they are sent increases when they
   post to the mailing list; publication of a telephone number in ENUM
   is no different, and may be used to send "junk faxes" or "junk SMS"
   for example.

   Many mailing list users have more than one email address and use
   "sacrificial" email accounts when posting to such lists to help
   filter out unrequested emails sent to them. This is not so easy with
   published telephone numbers; the PSTN E.164 number assignment process
   is much more involved and usually a single E.164 number (or a fixed
   range of numbers) is associated with each PSTN access. Thus providing
   a "sacrificial" phone number in any publication is not possible.

   Due to the implications of publishing data on a globally accessible
   database, as a principle the data subject MUST give their explicit
   informed consent to data being published in ENUM.

   In addition, they should be made aware that, due to storage of such
   data during harvesting by third parties, removal of the data from
   publication will not remove any copies that have been taken; in
   effect, any publication may be permanent.

   However, regulations in many regions will require that the data
   subject can at any time request that the data is removed from
   publication, and that their consent for its publication is explicitly
   confirmed at regular intervals.

   The user SHOULD be asked to confirm opening a web page or starting an
   ftp session (particularly if the ftp client is configured to send the
   user's email address as an "anonymous" user password).

   Using a web:http or ft:ftp service is not secure, and so the user
   should apply the same caution when entering personal data as they
   would do if using a client application started with any other method.
   Whilst this is not a feature of ENUM or these ENUMservices, the
   ENUM-using application on the end system may appear different from



Brandner, et al.        Expires October 31, 2004                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft    IANA Registration for ENUMservices web and ft May 2004


   the user's "normal" browser, and so the user SHOULD receive an
   indication on whether or not their communication is secured.

   As evaluating a web page can involve execution of embedded (or
   linked) content that may include executable code, there are risks
   involved in evaluating a web URL. If automatic evaluation of a web
   link were to be used, the querying user would be exposed to risks
   associated with that automatic download and execution of content.
   Thus the client MUST ask the querying user for confirmation before
   evaluating the web URL; the client MUST NOT download and evaluate the
   web content automatically.

   An analysis of threats specific to the dependence of ENUM on the DNS,
   and the applicability of DNSSEC [15] to these, is provided in RFC3761
   [3].
