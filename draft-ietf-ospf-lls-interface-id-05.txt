        OSPF LLS Extensions for Local Interface ID Advertisement
                  draft-ietf-ospf-lls-interface-id-05

Abstract

   Every OSPF interface is assigned an identifier, Interface ID, which
   uniquely identifies the interface on the router.  In some cases it is
   useful to know the Interface ID assigned by the adjacent router on
   its side of the adjacency (Remote Interface ID).

   This draft describes the extensions to OSPF link-local signalling to
   advertise the Local Interface Identifier.

1.  Introduction

   Every OSPF interface is assigned an Interface ID, which uniquely
   identifies the interface on the router.  For example, some
   implementations MAY be able to use the MIB-II IfIndex [RFC2863] as
   the Interface ID.

   Local/Remote Interface Identifiers MAY be flooded by OSPF [RFC2328]
   as defined in [RFC4203].  From the perspective of the advertising
   router, the Local Interface Identifier is a known value, however the
   Remote Interface Identifier needs to be learnt before it can be
   advertised.  [RFC4203] suggests to use TE Link Local LSA [RFC3630] to
   communicate the Local Interface Identifier to neighbors on the link.
   Though such mechanism works, it has some drawbacks.

   This draft proposes an extension to OSPF link-local signalling
   [RFC5613] to advertise the Local Interface Identifier.

2.  Interface ID Exchange using TE Opaque LSA

   Usage of the Link Local TE Opaque LSA to propagate the Local
   Interface Identifier to the neighbors on the link is described in
   [RFC4203].  This mechanism has following problems:

      LSAs can only be flooded over an existing adjacency that is in
      Exchange state or greater.  The adjacency state machine progresses
      independently on each side of the adjacency and, as such, may
      reach the Full state on one side before the TE Link Opaque LSA
      arrives.  The consequence is that link can be initially advertised
      without the Remote Interface Identifier.  Later, when the TE Link
      Opaque LSA arrives, the link must be advertised again, this time
      with the valid Remote Interface Identifier.  Implementations may
      choose to wait before advertising the link, but there is no
      guarantee that the neighbor will ever advertise the TE Link Opaque
      LSA with the Interface Identifier.  In summary, the existing
      mechanism does not guarantee that the Remote Interface Identifier
      is known at the time the link is advertised.

      The TE Opaque LSA is defined for MPLS Traffic Engineering, but the
      knowledge of the Remote Interface Identifier is useful also for
      cases where MPLS TE is not used.  One example is the lack of a
      valid 2-way connectivity check for parallel point-to-point links
      between OSPF routers.

3.  Interface ID Exchange using OSPF LLS

   To address the problems described earlier and to allow the Interface
   Identifier exchange to be part of the neighbor discovery process, we
   propose to extend OSPF link-local signalling to advertise the Local
   Interface Identifier in OSPF Hello packets.

3.1.  Local Interface Identifier TLV

   The Local Interface Identifier TLV is a LLS TLV.  It has following
   format:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |              Type             |             Length            |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                   Local Interface Identifier                  |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      Type: 18

      Length: 4 octets

      Local Interface Identifier: The value of the local Interface
      Identifier.

   Local Interface Identifier TLV signalling using LLS is applicable to
   all OSPF interface types other than virtual links.

4.  Backward Compatibility with RFC 4203

   Implementations which support Local Interface ID signalling using LLS
   MUST prefer the Local Interface ID value received through LLS over
   the value received through Link Local TE Opaque LSA if both are
   received from the same OSPF router.

   Implementations which support Local Interface ID signalling via Link
   Local TE Opaque LSA MAY continue to do so to ensure backward
   compatibility.  If they also support Local Interface ID signalling
   using LLS as described herein, they SHOULD signal the same Local
   Interface ID via both mechanisms.

   During the rare conditions, when the Local Interface ID changes, a
   timing interval may exist, where the received values of the Local
   Interface ID advertised through LLS and Link Local TE Opaque LSA may
   differ.  Such situation is temporary and received values via both
   mechanisms should become equal as soon as the next Hello and/or Link
   Local TE Opaque LSA is re-generated by the originator.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This specification allocates a single code point from the "Open
   Shortest Path First (OSPF) Link Local Signalling (LLS) - Type/Length/
   Value Identifiers (TLV)" registry.

   Following values is allocated:

   o 18 - Local Interface Identifier TLV

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for "OSPF Link-Local Signaling" [RFC5613]
   also apply to the Local Interface Identifier TLV described herein.
   The current usage of a neighbor's Local Interface Identifier is to
   disambiguate parallel links between OSPF routers.  Hence,
   modification of the advertised Local Interface Identifier TLV may
   result in the wrong neighbor interface identifier being advertised in

   the OSPFv2 Extended Link LSA [RFC8379] and could prevent the link
   from being used.  If authentication is being used in the OSPF routing
   domain [RFC5709], then the Cryptographic Authentication TLV [RFC5613]
   SHOULD also be used to protect that contents of the Link-Local
   Signaling (LLS) block.

   Implementations must assure that malformed LLS TLVs and Sub-TLVs
   permutations do not result in errors which cause hard OSPF failures.
