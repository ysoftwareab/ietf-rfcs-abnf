                         I2RS overlay use case
                 draft-hu-i2rs-overlay-use-case-05.txt

Abstract

   This document proposes an overlay network use case for interface to
   routing system (I2RS).  The forwarding routers network is assumed to
   be an overlay structure.  There are two types of forwarding routers:
   Edge Router(ER) and Core Routers(CR).  Edge Router encapsulates
   format data based on the tunnel type, which are established among
   Edge Routers.  Core Router would be very simple and cheap.  CRs focus
   on the encapsulation data forwarding.  In order to reduce the overall
   ER costs, the use of network virtualization is proposed in this
   document.

1.  Introduction

   The hierarchical structure of current Internet core has remained
   largely unchanged since its invention.  In the face of growing
   traffic, service providers must keep investing in larger and faster
   routers and links, especially in the core part of Internet, even
   though revenues are growing relatively slowly in that segment.

   It is necessary to develop and deploy new structure in order to
   maintain a steady growth of the core without significantly increasing
   the expenses.  In addition, as modern networks grow in scale and
   complexity, the need for rapid and dynamic control increases.  I2RS
   ([I2RS-FRM]) provides a new routing system framework to meet these
   requirements.  There is a programmable interface for the forwarding
   router.  All the forwarding routers should support the I2RS agent to
   communicate with controllers.  The forwarding routers gather the
   traffic and topology information, report to the controllers, and
   receive the forwarding policy from controllers.

   Besides the idea of programmable and open interface, another key
   feature is forwarding plane and control plane separation in the I2RS

   in addition to using the concept of software defined networking.
   Some of the control and computing function could be separation from
   traditional routers.  By this way, We could reduce the cost of core
   forwarding device.  This document proposes an overlay network
   structure based on the I2RS framework.  We hope that the service and
   data encapsulation are all done in the routers of the edge of
   network, and the routers in the core part are only focus on MPLS data
   forwarding.  The RIB table of the routers in core part could only
   store very few IP routing record for management.  In this way, the
   expensive TCAM chip for routers in the core part could be replaced by
   cheap ASIC chip, and the cost would be reduced significantly.  The
   full mesh tunnel is required for the edge Routers.  The forwarding
   routers in the overlay network are divided into two types based on
   the roles in the network: CR(Core Router) and ER(Edge Router).  The
   Edge Routers encapsulate the forwarding data based on the tunnel
   type, gather topology information, and report traffic to the
   controller, while Core Routers would be MPLS switches actually, and
   focus on fast MPLS data forwarding and receive only policy related
   information(metadata)from the controller.

                            Figure 1: An Overlay Structure.

   The overlay structure is as shown in Figure 1.  The upper half part
   of the Figure shows a physical network.  The Edge Routers are located
   in the edge of the overlay network, and are logically connected
   through Core Routers.  The services and data encapsulation are done
   in the edge routers.  The Core Routers(MPLS Switches) are very simple
   and focus on the MPLS data forwarding according to the label
   forwarding table, and may not perceive any distinction among the
   tunnels to/from Edge Routers.

   The lower half of the Figure shows a logical tunnel network.  All the
   Edge Routers are connected via a logical-full mesh tunnel-based
   connection among them.  The tunnel could be an MPLS tunnel.  Edge
   Router encapsulates/decapsulates MPLS data.

2.2.  The Benefit of Overlay Network Structure

   (1)  Lower cost for Core Routers: For the Core Router, it is not
        required to compute route, and distribute protocol signal.  The
        Core Routers only store the equipment IP prefix, and do not
        store user IP prefix any more.  The RIB and FIB table for core
        Router are very small.  The size routing tables in the Core
        Routers does not increase and remains stable with the growth of
        the numbers of users.

   (2)  Improved network security: The overlay network structure
        improves network security by splitting(and hence isolating)the
        provider equipment and user station.  The attacks from hacker to
        core routers would therefore be separated by the edge routers.

   (3)  Support of network virtualization: Some of the control and
        computing function could be separated from Edge Router and be
        done by the controller.  The edge router in the future could be
        a simple hardware platform.  The service, policy, and other
        control functions, such as route computing, signal distribution
        can be furnished by physical/virtual servers.  The network
        virtualization for Edge Router is discussed in section 3.

2.3.  Core Router Requirements

   The Core Router performs the following functions:

   (1)  Core Routers mainly focus on fast forwarding encapsulated data.

   (2)  The control plane is very simple.  It announces and floods the
        topology information.

   (3)  For compatibility reasons, Route computation may be needed, but
        is not absolutely necessary.

2.4.  Edge Router Requirement

   The edge Router performs the following functions:

   (1)  Access and resources management: Edge Routers support user
        Access authentication, authorization, and resource control and
        management.  When there is new user access network, the edge
        router support user access authentication, authorization.  If
        the subscriber is legal and registered, he/she should should
        pass the access authentication and authorization tests.

   (2)  Encapsulation data and tunnel type decision: Edge Router
        negotiates with the peer Edge router based on the service



Hu, et al.                Expires July 30, 2015                 [Page 5]

        traffic through controller, and encapsulates the original data
        traffic.

   (3)  Topology management:Edge Router gathers the network topology
        information and reports the topology to the controller.  When
        the topology changes, the edge router reports the changes as
        well.

   (4)  Policy management: Edge Router identifies the policy from The
        I2RS Commissioner([I2RS-FRM]).

   (5)  Service management: Edge Routers should identify the services
        and perform the appropriate encapsulation.

   (6)  Route and signal protocol management: Edge Router computes route
        based on the topology information received from other edge
        router and core router.

   (7)  Tunnel control and management: Edge Routers manage and maintain
        tunnel information.  All of the edge routers are connected over
        logical full-mesh based tunnel network.

   (8)  Traffic analysis and reporting: Edge router monitors the data
        traffic, and reports the traffic updates/changes.

3.  MPLS Tunnel automatic configuration

   The MPLS tunnel among the ERs(Edge Routers) could be automatically
   configured and established according to the clients' requirements and
   information.  The procedure is as following: The controller (I2RS
   clients) receives the VPN information from Edge Router through the
   programmable interface of I2RS Agent.  The VPN information includes
   VPN Table ID, and table item.  The table item is composed of the
   following parameters: item key value, exit interface, VPN identifies,
   VPN forwarding identifies, Master/Slave flag, load balance flag, keep
   alive time, etc.

   The item key value is the packet destination address.  For example,
   if the packet is encapsulated as L2VPN, the item key value is MAC
   address, while if the packet is encapsulated as L3VPN,the item key
   value is IP address.

   Exit interface is the VPN binding interface or local device
   identifier when it is the VPN information sent from I2RS Agent to
   I2RS Client.  If the VPN information is sent from I2RS Client to SR/
   CR through I2RS agent interface, the exit interface is the remote SR/
   CR identifier or the local tunnel ID, which indicates the end to end

   connection from network management (I2RS Client) to CR/ER(I2RS
   Agent).

   VPN identifier is used to identify the unique global VPN in the area.

   VPN Table ID is the index of VPN user information item.

   VPN forwarding identifier is used to identify the forwarding data
   plane packet.  Generally, it is the MPLS label.

   Master/salve flag indicates the optimal and backup path, which could
   be used as path protection or traffic engineering.

   Load balance flag indicates multiple next hop for the forwarding
   identifier, which is used for load balance.

   Keep alive time indicates the alive time for the item.

   Network management collects all of the VPN user information, and
   computes the forwarding path and Unified policy based on it.  Then it
   downloads the forwarding information to each ER/SR through I2RS Agent
   interface.

4.  Security Alliance among ER

   In the overlay network structure, the ER are full mesh.  This session
   provides a solution to setup SA(security Alliance) among ERs.  The
   security parameter negotiation could be finished through I2RS Client.

   As an example, let us consider the following figure(Figure 2).


                       +--------------+

   As shown in Figure 2, ER1 and ER2 need to establish SA(security
   Alliance), and adopt IPSec as the security transport channel.

   (1)  ER1 and ER2 connect to the controller(I2RS Client) via logical
        tunnels, and the controller download the IPSec SA parameters to
        them.  The parameters include: VPN Type(for example IPSec, L2VPN
        etc.), direction of AS(export or import), address family(IPv4 or
        IPv6), encapsulation mode, encapsulation protocol(AH or ESP),
        authentication algorithm (MD5 or SHA), ESP algorithm
        mode(Encryption or compression algorithm), Encryption mode, SA
        lifetime type, SA index, destination IP address of IPSec, Source
        IP address of IPSec, Secret key, Security parameter index
        information(SPI), and Access control list(ACL) configuration.

   (2)  ER1 and ER2 then establish IPSec security channel respectively.
        They negotiate the IPSec parameter with controller through IKE
        protocol.  By this way, the ERs and controller establish a
        security and reliable connection link.

   (3)  The controller downloads the necessary parameters to the ERs
        through network routing protocol(such as BGP) or Netconf
        protocol.

   (4)  ERs receives the packets with required parameters from the
        controller(I2RS Client), and decryption the packets, then write
        the IPSec parameters to SD table.

   (5)  The Security alliance between ER1 and ER2 is thereby
        established.

   (6)  When the Security alliance is expired, controller re-computes
        the secret key, and restarts the above steps in order to re-
        establish the security alliance.

5.  Network Virtualization(NV)

5.1.  Benefits of Network Virtualization

   (1)  NV reduces ER complexity and equipment costs.

   (2)  NV allows flexibility and rapid deployment of new services;
        services can also be quickly scaled up/down based on demands.

   (3)  NV offers seamless support of scalability and reliability

   (4)  NV allows flexibility and simplicity of function combination,
        for co-existence with hardware based network platform.  An ER

        could be utilized both as BRAS, Firewall, or NAT equipment on
        the same hardware platform.

5.2.  Applications and Requirements

   (1)  Tunnel gateway elements: IPSec/SSL VPN gateway.

   (2)  Traffic analytics: DPI, QoS measurement, SLA agent.

   (3)  Converged and network-wide functions: AAA Server, policy control
        and charging platform.

   (4)  Security function: Firewalls, virus scanners, instruction
        detection and prevention systems.

5.3.  Network Virtualization

   Edge routers can support network virtualization.  An ER can be a
   hardware based platform, and the other necessary adjunct functions
   can be supported via separate servers.  A programmable interface
   between functional server and edge router can be used to support this
   paradigm.  When there is new service, it is required to add a new
   server to support that service, and there may only be minimal or no
   changes required to the edge routers, as shown in Figure 3.
