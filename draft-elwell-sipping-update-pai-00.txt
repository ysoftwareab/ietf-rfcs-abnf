Abstract

   SIP has a mechanism for conveying the asserted identity of the
   originator of a request by means of the P-Asserted-Identity header
   field.  This header field is specified for use in requests using a
   number of SIP methods, in particular the INVITE method.  However, it
   is not specified for use in requests using the SIP UPDATE method.
   This document extends RFC 3325 by allowing use of the P-Asserted-

Internet-Draft       Asserted Identity in SIP UPDATE        October 2006


1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [2].


2.  Introduction

   SIP (RFC 3261 [1]) has a mechanism for conveying the asserted
   identity of the originator of a request by means of the P-Asserted-
   Identity header field (RFC 3325 [4]).  This header field is specified
   for use in requests using a number of SIP methods, in particular the
   INVITE method.  However, it is not specified for use in requests
   using the SIP UPDATE method (RFC 3311 [3]).  This document extends
   RFC 3325 by allowing use of the P-Asserted-Identity header field in
   UPDATE requests.


3.  Use cases

   There are several use cases that would benefit from the use of the
   P-Asserted-Identity header field in an UPDATE request.  These use
   cases apply within a trusted environment where the use of asserted
   identity is appropriate (see RFC 3325).

   In one example an established call passes through a gateway to the
   PSTN.  The gateway becomes aware that the remote party in the PSTN
   has changed, e.g., due to call transfer.  By including the
   P-Asserted-Identity header field in an UPDATE request, the gateway
   can convey the identity of the new remote party to the peer SIP UA.

      Note that the (re-)INVITE method could be used in this situation.
      However, this forces an offer-answer exchange, which typically is
      not required in this situation.  Also it involves 3 messages
      rather than 2.

   In another example, a B2BUA that provides third party call control
   (3PCC) wishes to join two calls together, one of which is still
   waiting to be answered and potentially is forked to different UAs.
   At this point in time it is not possible to trigger the normal offer-
   answer exchange between the two joined parties, because of the
   mismatch between a single dialog on the one side and potentially
   multiple early dialogs on the other side, so this action must wait
   until one of the called UAs answers.  However, it would be useful to
   give an early indication to each user concerned of the identity of
   the user to which they will become connected when the call is
   answered.  This can be achieved by the B2BUA sending an UPDATE

   request with a P-Asserted-Identity header field on the dialogs
   concerned.


4.  Behaviour

   This updates RFC 3325 by allowing a P-Asserted-Identity header field
   to appear in an UPDATE request.

4.1.  UAC Behaviour

   A UAC MAY include a P-Asserted-Identity header field in an UPDATE
   request to report the identity of the user on behalf of which the UAC
   is acting and whose identity the UAC is in a position to assert.
   This can be an UPDATE request sent specially for this purpose or an
   UPDATE request sent for some other purpose.

4.2.  Proxy Behaviour

   If a UAC receives an UPDATE request containing a P-Asserted-Identity
   header field, it MUST behave as for any other request in accordance
   with the rules of RFC 3325 for a proxy.

4.3.  UAS Behaviour

   If a UAC receives an UPDATE request containing a P-Asserted-Identity
   header field, it MUST behave as for any other request in accordance
   with the rules of RFC 3325 for a UAS.


5.  Security considerations

   The use of asserted identity raises a number of security
   considerations, which are discussed fully in RFC 3325 [4].  This
   document does not introduce any additional security considerations.
