 1. Abstract 
     
    This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management 
    Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in 
    the Internet community.  In particular, it describes managed 
    objects used for managing IP Multicast Routing for IPv4 and IPv6, 
    independent of the specific multicast routing protocol in use.  
     
 2. Introduction 
     
    This MIB describes objects used for managing IPv4 and IPv6 
    Multicast Routing[2],independent of the specific multicast routing 
    protocol [3,4,5,6,7] in use. This MIB extends the MIB proposed in 
    [8]. Managed objects specific to particular multicast routing 
    protocols are specified elsewhere.  Similarly, this MIB does not 
    support management of multicast routing for other address families. 
    Such management may be supported by other MIBs. 
     
 3. The SNMP Management Framework 
     
                                                                      1 
                 draft-thaler-idmr-multicast-routemib-1       June 2000 


     
    The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major 
    components:  
     
    o    An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [9].  
     
    o    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for 
    the purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of 
    Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in RFC 
    1155 [10], RFC 1212 [11] and RFC 1215 [12]. The second version, 
    called SMIv2, is described in RFC 2578 [13], RFC 2579 [14] and RFC 
    2580 [15].  
     
    o    Message protocols for transferring management information. The 
    first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and 
    described in RFC 1157 [16]. A second version of the SNMP message 
    protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is 
    called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [17] and RFC 1906 [18]. 
    The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and 
    described in RFC 1906 [18], RFC 2572 [19] and RFC 2574 [20].  
     
    o    Protocol operations for accessing management information. The 
    first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is 
    described in RFC 1157 [16]. A second set of protocol operations and 
    associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [21].  
     
     
    o    A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [22] 
    and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 
    [23].  
     
    Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
    termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB 
    are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.  
     
    This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A 
    MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate 
    translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically 
    equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no 
    translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable 
    information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in 
    SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine 
    readable information is not considered to change the semantics of 
    the MIB. 
     
 4. Overview 
     
     
    This MIB module contains one scalar and five tables.  The tables 
    are:

    (1)   the Multicast Route Table containing multicast routing 
    information for datagrams sent by particular sources to the 
    multicast groups known to a router.  
     
    (2)   the Multicast Routing Next Hop Table containing information 
    on the next-hops for the routing multicast datagrams.  Each entry 
    is one of a list of next-hops on outgoing interfaces for particular 
    qsources sending to a particular multicast group address.  
     
    (3)   the Multicast Routing Interface Table containing multicast 
    routing information specific to interfaces.  
     
    (4)   the Multicast Scope Boundary Table containing the boundaries 
    configured for multicast scopes [24].  
     
    (5)   the Multicast Scope Name Table containing human-readable 
    names of multicast scope.

                exceed the allowed length of this syntax, and thus be 
                impossible to represent with this syntax.  Sampling of 
                language tags in current use on the Internet suggests

 6. IANA Considerations 
    The ipMRouteRtProto, ipMRouteNextHopProtocol, 
    ipMRouteInterfaceProtocol, and ipMRouteProtocol use textual 
    conventions imported from the IANA-RTPROTO-MIB. The purpose of 
    defining these textual conventions in a separate MIB module is to 
    allow additional values to be defined without having to issue a new 
    version of this document. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority 
    (IANA) is responsible for the assignment of all Internet numbers, 
    including various SNMP- related numbers; it will administer the 
    values associated with these textual conventions. The rules for 
    additions or changes to the IANA-RTPROTO-MIB are outlined in the 
    DESCRIPTION clause associated with its MODULE-IDENTITY statement. 
    The current versions of the IANA-RTPROTO-MIB can be accessed from 
    the IANA home page at: "http://www.iana.org/".  
  

 7. Security Considerations 
     
    This MIB contains readable objects whose values provide information 
    related to multicast routing, including information on what 
    machines are sending to which groups.  There are also a number of 
    objects that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-
    create, such as those which allow an administrator to configure 
    multicast boundaries. 
     
    While unauthorized access to the readable objects is relatively 
    innocuous, unauthorized access to the write-able objects could 
    cause a denial of service, or could cause wider distribution of 
    packets intended only for local distribution.  Hence, the support 
    for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper 
    protection can have a negative effect on network operations. 
     
    SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the 
    network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, 
    there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to 
    access and SET (change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB. 
     
    It is recommended that the implementers consider the security 
    features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the 
    use of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [20] and the View-
    based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [23] is recommended. 
     
    It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP 
    entity giving access to this MIB, is properly configured to give 
    access to those objects only to those principals (users) that have 
    legitimate rights to access them.
