1.  Introduction

   This document defines how to use the WebRTC Data Channel mechanism
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel] in order to realize a data channel,
   referred to as a CLUE data channel, for transporting CLUE protocol
   messages between two CLUE entities.

Internet-Draft              CLUE Data Channel              November 2014


   The document defines how to describe the SCTPoDTLS association
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-encaps] used to realize the CLUE data
   channel using SDP, and defines usage of two mechanisms for
   establishing a CLUE data channel: the Data Channel Establishment
   Protocol (DCEP) [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-protocol] and the SDP-based
   "SCTP over DTLS" data channel negotiation mechanism
   [I-D.ejzak-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg].  This includes SCTP
   considerations specific to a CLUE data channel, the SDP Media
   Description (m- line) values, usage of SDP attributes and DCEP
   considerations (when DCEP is used) specific to a CLUE data channel.

   Details and procedures associated with the CLUE protocol, and the SDP
   Offer/Answer [RFC3264] procedures for negotiating usage of a CLUE
   data channel, are outside the scope of this document.

   Simultaneous usage of DCEP and the SDP-based "SCTP over DTLS" data
   channel negotiation mechanism for opening a CLUE data channel is
   outside the scope of this specification.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

   WebRTC Data Channel refers to a SCTPoDTLS association
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-encaps] that is used to transport non-media
   data between two entities, according to the procedures in
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel].

   CLUE data channel refers to a WebRTC Data Channel
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel] realization, with a specific set of
   SCTP characteristics, with the purpose of transporting CLUE protocol
   [I-D.ietf-clue-protocol] messages between two CLUE entities.

   CLUE entity refers to a SIP User Agent (UA) [RFC3261] that supports
   the CLUE data channel and the CLUE protocol.

   CLUE session refers to a SIP session [RFC3261] between to SIP UAs,
   where a CLUE data channel, associated with the SIP session, has been
   established between the SIP UAs.

   [RFC4960] defines an SCTP stream as a unidirectional logical channel
   established from one to another associated SCTP endpoint, within
   which all user messages are delivered in sequence except for those
   submitted to the unordered delivery service.

Internet-Draft              CLUE Data Channel              November 2014


   [RFC4960] defines an SCTP identifier as a unsigned integer, which
   identifies a SCTP stream.

3.  CLUE Data Channel

3.1.  General

   This section describes the realization of a CLUE Data Channel.  This
   includes a set of SCTP characteristics specific to a CLUE Data
   Channel, the values of the m- line describing the SCTPoDTLS
   association associated with the WEBRTC Data Channel, and the usage of
   either DCEP or SDP-based "SCTP over DTLS" data channel negotiation
   mechanism for creating the CLUE Data Channel.

   As described in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel], the SCTP streams
   realizing a WebRTC Data Channel must be associated with the same SCTP
   association.  In addition, both SCTP streams realizing the WebRTC
   Data Channel must use the same SCTP stream identifier value.  These
   rules also apply to a CLUE Data Channel.

   Within a given CLUE session, a CLUE entity MUST use a single CLUE
   Data Channel for transport of all CLUE messages towards its peer.

3.2.  SDP Considerations

3.2.1.  General

   This section defines how to construct the SDP Media Description (m-
   line) for describing the SCTPoDTLS association used to realize a
   WebRTC Data Channel.  The section also defines how to construct the
   SDP dcmap attribute, when the SDP-based "SCTP over DTLS" data channel
   negotiation mechanism is used for establishing a CLUE Data Channel on
   the SCTPoDTLS association.

   NOTE: Other protocols than SDP for negotiating usage of a SCTPoDTLS
   association for realizing a WebRTC Data Channel are outside the scope
   of this specification.

   [I-D.ietf-clue-signaling] describes the SDP Offer/Answer procedures
   for negotiating a CLUE session, including the CLUE controlled media
   streams and the CLUE Data Channel.

3.2.1.1.  SDP Media Description Fields

   As defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sctp-sdp], the field values of an m-
   line describing an SCTPoDTLS association are set as following:

Internet-Draft              CLUE Data Channel              November 2014


   +---------------+----------------+-------------+-------------------+

   | "application" | UDP port value | "DTLS/SCTP" | application usage |
   +---------------+----------------+-------------+-------------------+

                     Table 1: SDP "proto" field values

   As defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sctp-sdp], when the SCTPoDTLS
   association is used to realize a WebRTC data channel, the value of
   the application usage part is 'webrtc-datachannel'.

3.2.1.2.  SDP sctp-port Attribute

   As defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sctp-sdp], the SDP sctp-port attribute
   value is set to the SCTP port of the SCTPoDTLS association.

   NOTE: Usage of the SDP sctp-port attribute is optional.  As defined
   in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sctp-sdp], if the attribute is not present then
   the default value is 5000.

3.2.2.  SDP dcpmap Attribute

   If the the SDP-based "SCTP over DTLS" data channel negotiation
   mechanism is used to establish a CLUE data channel, the values of the
   SDP dcmap attribute [I-D.ejzak-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg],
   associated with the m- line describing the SCTPoDTLS association used
   to realize the WebRTC Data Channel, are set as following:

3.2.3.  SDP dcsa Attribute

   The SDP dcsa attribute [I-D.ejzak-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg] is not
   used when establishing a CLUE data channel.

3.2.4.  Example


           m=application 54111 DTLS/SCTP webrtc-datachannel
           a=dcmap:2 subprotocol="CLUE"


          Figure 1: SDP Media Description for a CLUE Data Channel

3.3.  DCEP Considerations

3.3.1.  General

   This section describes how to realize a CLUE data channel using DCEP.

3.3.2.  Open CLUE Data Channel

   Once the SCTPoDTLS association, used to realize a WebRTC Data Channel
   has been established, the offerer [RFC3264] is responsible for
   establishing the CLUE data channel.  The offerer MUST send a DCEP
   DATA_CHANNEL_OPEN message [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-protocol].  The value
   of the 'protocol' field MUST be "CLUE".  The value of the 'channel
   type' MUST be 'DATA_CHANNEL_RELIABLE'.

   Once the offerer has received the associated DCEP DATA_CHANNEL_ACK
   message [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-protocol], the CLUE data channel has
   been established.

   If the offerer receives a DCEP DATA_CHANNEL_OPEN message, for the
   purpose of establishing a CLUE data channel, the offerer MUST reset
   the SCTP stream, in order to prevent two CLUE data channels from
   being established within the same CLUE session.  The offerer MUST NOT
   send a DCEP DATA_CHANNEL_ACK message.

   NOTE: If another mechanism than SDP Offer/Answer is used to negotiate
   the SCTPoDTLS association used to realize the WebRTC Data Channel,
   that mechanism needs to describ which endpoint is responsible for
   sending the DCEP_CHANNEL_OPEN message, etc.

Internet-Draft              CLUE Data Channel              November 2014


3.3.3.  Close CLUE Data Channel

   DCEP [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-protocol] does not define a message for
   closing individual data channels.  As described in
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-protocol], in order to close a data channel, a
   SCTP reset message is sent, in order to close the SCTP stream
   associated with the data channel.  The SCTPoDTLS association, and
   other data channels established on the same association, are not
   affected by the SCTP reset message.

3.4.  SCTP Considerations

3.4.1.  SCTP Payload Protocol Identifier (PPID)

   As described in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-protocol], the PPID value 50 is
   used when sending a DCEP message on a SCTPoDTLS association used to
   realize a WebRTC Data Channel.

   A CLUE entity MUST use the PPID value 51 when sending a CLUE message
   on a CLUE data channel.

   NOTE: As described in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel], the PPID value
   51 indicates that the SCTP message contains data encoded in a UTF-8
   format.  The PPID value 51 does not indicate what application
   protocol the SCTP message is associated with, only the format in
   which the data is encoded.

                         +----------+------------+
                         | Protocol | PPID Value |
                         +----------+------------+
                         |   DCEP   |     50     |
                         |   CLUE   |     51     |
                         +----------+------------+

                  Table 3: CLUE Data Channel PPID Values

3.4.2.  Reliability

   The usage of SCTP for the CLUE Data Channel ensures reliable
   transport of CLUE protocol [I-D.ietf-clue-protocol] messages.

   A CLUE entity MUST NOT use the partial reliability and limited
   retransmission extensions defined in [RFC3758].

   NOTE: [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel] requires the support of the
   partial reliability extension defined in [RFC3758].  This is not
   needed for a CLUE Data Channel, as messages are required to always be
   sent reliably.  [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel] also mandates support

Internet-Draft              CLUE Data Channel              November 2014


   of the limited retransmission policy defined in
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctp-prpolicies].

3.4.3.  Order

   A CLUE entity MUST use the ordered delivery SCTP service, as
   described in section 6.6 of [RFC4960].

3.4.4.  Stream Reset

   A CLUE entity MUST support the stream reset extension defined in
   [RFC6525].

   The dynamic address reconfiguration extension defined in [RFC5061]
   MUST be used to signal the support of the stream reset extension
   defined in [RFC6525].  Other features of [RFC5061] MUST NOT be used.

3.4.5.  SCTP Multihoming

   SCTP multi-homing is not supported for SCTPoDTLS associations, and
   can therefor not be used for a CLUE data channel.

4.  Security Considerations

   This specification does not introduce new security considerations, in
   addition to those defined in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel] and
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-protocol].  Security considerations associated
   with the CLUE protocol are defined in [I-D.ietf-clue-protocol].

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  New WebRTC Data Channel Protocol Value

   [RFC EDITOR NOTE: Please replace RFC-XXXX with the RFC number of this
   document.]

   This document adds the 'CLUE' value to the "WebSocket Subprotocol
   Name Registry" as follows:


       Subprotocl Identifier:      CLUE
       Subprotocol Common Name:    CLUE
       Subprotocol Definition:     RFC-XXXX
