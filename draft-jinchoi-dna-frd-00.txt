Abstract

   This document presents RA Caching in AP for Fast Router Discovery.
   For seamless handoff, a mobile node MUST quickly discover its new
   access router.  In our proposal an AP caches a Router Advertisement
   message and sends it to a new mobile node as soon as new L2
   association is made.  We present a way for an AP to cache a suitable
   RA.  By putting 'RA Caching' and 'AP Notification' functionality on
   AP, we get the optimized result without IPv6 standard change.

Internet-Draft    Fast Router Discovery with RA Caching        July 2004


1.  Introduction

   The primary movement detection mechanism for Mobile IPv6 defined in
   [8] uses the facilities of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery [4], including
   Router Discovery and Neighbor Unreachability Detection.  A mobile
   node MUST quickly detect when it moves to a link served by a new
   access router, so that it can acquire a new care-of address and send
   Binding Updates quickly.  A mobile node MUST receive Router
   Advertisement from a new access router as soon as possible.

   There are several hindrances for sufficiently fast Router Discovery.
   First, Neighbor Discovery protocol [4] limits routers to a minimum
   interval of 3 seconds between sending unsolicited multicast Router
   Advertisement messages.  Second, it SHOULD delay the transmission for
   a random amount of time before a mobile node sends an initial Router
   Solicitation.  Third, a router MUST delay a response to a Router
   Solicitation by a random time too.  Though solutions are proposed by
   [8], [11], they require IPv6 standard [4] change.

   In our proposal AP (Access Point) caches a suitable RA (Router
   Advertisement) message , for example 'RA optimized for DNA' defined
   in [10], and sends it to a new mobile node as soon as L2 association
   is made.  We present a way for an AP to cache a suitable RA.  By
   putting 'RA Caching' and 'AP Notification' functionality on an Access
   Point, we get the optimized result without IPv6 standard change.  In
   our scheme, mobile node receives Router Advertisement just after L2
   association is made which is the earliest possible time under the
   current standard.

2.  Terminology

   Access Router (AR)

   An Access Network Router residing on the edge of an Access Network
   and offers IP connectivity to mobile nodes.

   Access Point (AP)

   An L2 entity that has station functionality and provides access to
   the distribution services, via the wireless medium for associated
   stations.

3.  Proposal Overview

   In 802.11 b Wireless LAN technology, when an MN (mobile node) arrives
   at a new link, it should associate with a new AP.

   In our proposal, an AP caches an RA message beforehand and sends it
   to a mobile node as soon as L2 association is made.

   We can cache an RA in an AP manually or use the following scheme.  An
   AR (Access Router) periodically multicasts an unsolicited RA, which
   goes through an AP.  So the AP can scan incoming L2 frames and cache
   a necessary RA.  the AP scans L2 frames either continuously or
   periodically to update a stored RA.  Moreover if an AR and an AP are
   under same network administration, they can be configured such that
   an AP caches an RA efficiently.

4.  Operation Description

   Our proposal consists of 'RA Caching' and 'AP Notification', RA
   Caching periodically scans incoming L2 frames for an unsolicited RA
   and stores it.  AP Notification sends a stored RA to a new MN as soon
   as L2 association is made.

4.1  RA Caching

   An AP scans incoming L2 frame for an unsolicited RA.

   First it scans L2 frame header to see whether it is a multicast
   frame.  If not, the AP sends that frame down link and scans a next L2
   frame.  If so, the AP looks IP header to check whether it contains an
   unsolicited RA.  If incoming L2 frame doesn't contain an unsolicited
   RA, the AP sends that frame down link and scans a next L2 frame.
   When the AP finds an unsolicited RA, it stores it and sends a copy
   down link.

   An AP can scan continuously, updating an old RA with a new RA.  Or if
   it costs too much for the AP to scan every incoming L2 frame, we can
   control the scanning rate.  For example, we can set timer and execute
   scanning every T seconds.  Or we can make the AP to be able to send
   Router Solicitation message.  Periodically the AP sends Router
   Solicitation.  Then an AR will reply an RA and the AP caches it.  It
   is noted that the AP doesn't need to have IP address since it can use
   unspecified address as its source address.

4.2  AP Notification

   When a new MN arrives at an AP, it sends an Association Request
   Message with its MAC address.  Then the AP grants association by
   sending an Association Response Message.  As soon as association is
   made, the AP sends a stored RA to a new MN with MAC address in
   Association Request message.  The MN receives an RA just after
   association is made which is the earliest possible time in current
   standard.

5.  IANA Considerations

   No new message formats or services are defined in this document.

6.  Security Considerations

   Since our proposal is based on Neighbor Discovery, its trust models
   and threats are similar to the ones presented in [4].

   If higher layer notification of connectivity is not available, and
   eager handoff strategies are in place, any node or router which
   advertises an RA with a false prefix will cause mobile nodes to
   perform spurious handover signalling and DAD operations.

   But above threats are inherent to all schemes which depends
   exclusively on Router Discovery for movement detection.  Our proposal
   doesn't incur any additional threats.  We will incorporate the
   solutions [12] developed in IETF SEND Working Group when available.
