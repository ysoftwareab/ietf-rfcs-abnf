            ECDHE_PSK with AES-GCM and AES-CCM Cipher Suites
                   for Transport Layer Security (TLS)
                  draft-mattsson-tls-ecdhe-psk-aead-03

Abstract

   This document defines several new cipher suites for the Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) protocol.  The cipher suites are all based on
   the Ephemeral Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman with Pre-Shared Key
   (ECDHE_PSK) key exchange together with the Authenticated Encryption
   with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithms AES-GCM and AES-CCM.  PSK
   provides light and efficient authentication, ECDHE provides perfect
   forward secrecy, and AES-GCM and AES-CCM provides encryption and
   integrity protection.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines new cipher suites that provide Pre-Shared Key
   (PSK) authentication, Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), and
   Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD).  The cipher
   suites are defined for version 1.2 or later of the the Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] protocol, as well as version 1.2 or
   later of the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol
   [RFC6347].

   Pre-Shared Key (PSK) Authentication is widely used in many scenarios.
   One deployment is 3GPP networks where pre-shared keys are used to
   authenticate both subscriber and network.  Another deployment is
   Internet of Things where PSK authentication is often preferred for
   performance and energy efficiency reasons.  In both scenarios the
   endpoints are owned/controlled by a party that provisions the pre-
   shared keys and makes sure that they provide a high level of entropy.

   Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) is a strongly recommended feature in
   security protocol design and can be accomplished by using an
   ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange method.  Ephemeral Elliptic
   Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) provides PFS with excellent performance
   and small key sizes.  ECDHE is mandatory to implement in both HTTP/2
   [RFC7540] and CoAP [RFC7252].

   AEAD algorithms that combine encryption and integrity protection are
   strongly recommended [RFC7525] and non-AEAD algorithms are forbidden
   to use in TLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13].  The AEAD algorithms
   considered in this document are AES-GCM and AES-CCM.  The use of AES-

   GCM in TLS is defined in [RFC5288] and the use of AES-CCM is defined
   in [RFC6655].

   [RFC4279] defines Pre-Shared Key (PSK) cipher suites for TLS but does
   not consider Elliptic Curve Cryptography.  [RFC4492] introduces
   Elliptic Curve Cryptography for TLS but does not consider PSK
   authentication.  [RFC5487] describes the use of AES-GCM in
   combination with PSK authentication, but does not consider ECDHE.
   [RFC5489] describes the use of PSK in combination with ECDHE but does
   not consider AES-GCM or AES-CCM.

2.  ECDHE_PSK with AES-GCM and AES-CCM Cipher Suites

   The cipher suites defined in this document are based on the AES-GCM
   and AES-CCM Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD)
   algorithms AEAD_AES_128_GCM, AEAD_AES_256_GCM, AEAD_AES_128_CCM, and
   AEAD_AES_256_CCM defined in [RFC5116], and AEAD_AES_128_CCM_8 defined
   in [RFC6655].  The following cipher suites are defined:

      TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256               = {TDB0,TDB1};
      TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384               = {TDB2,TDB3};
      TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256             = {TDB4,TDB5};
      TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_SHA256               = {TDB6,TDB7};
      TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CCM_SHA384               = {TDB8,TDB9};

   For the AES-128 cipher suites, the TLS Pseudorandom Function (PRF)
   with SHA-256 as the hash function SHALL be used and Clients and
   Servers MUST NOT negotiate curves of less than 255 bits.

   For the AES-256 cipher suites, the TLS PRF with SHA-384 as the hash
   function SHALL be used and Clients and Servers MUST NOT negotiate
   curves of less than 384 bits.

   When used in TLS 1.2, the keying material is derived as described in
   [RFC5489] and [RFC5246] and nonces are constructed as described in
   [RFC5288], and [RFC6655].  When used in TLS 1.3, the keying material
   is derived as described in [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13], and the nonces are
   constructed as described in [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13].

3.  Applicable TLS Versions

   The cipher suites defined in this document make use of the
   authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD) defined in TLS
   1.2 [RFC5246] and DTLS 1.2 [RFC6347].  Earlier versions of TLS do not
   have support for AEAD and consequently, these cipher suites MUST NOT
   be negotiated in TLS versions prior to 1.2.  Clients MUST NOT offer
   these cipher suites if they do not offer TLS 1.2 or later.  Servers,
   which select an earlier version of TLS MUST NOT select one of these

   cipher suites.  A client MUST treat the selection of these cipher
   suites in combination with a version of TLS that does not support
   AEAD (i.e., TLS 1.1 or earlier) as an error and generate a fatal
   'illegal_parameter' TLS alert.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines the following new cipher suites, whose values
   have been assigned in the TLS Cipher Suite Registry defined by
   [RFC5246].

      TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256               = {TDB0,TDB1};
      TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384               = {TDB2,TDB3};
      TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256             = {TDB4,TDB5};
      TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_SHA256               = {TDB6,TDB7};
      TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CCM_SHA384               = {TDB8,TDB9};

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in TLS 1.2 [RFC5246], DTLS 1.2 [RFC6347],
   TLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13], ECDHE_PSK [RFC5489], AES-GCM [RFC5288],
   and AES-CCM [RFC6655] apply to this document as well.

   All the cipher suites defined in this document provide
   confidentiality, mutual authentication, and perfect forward secrecy.
   The AES-128 cipher suites provide 128-bit security and the AES-256
   cipher suites provide at least 192-bit security.  However,
   AES_128_CCM_8 only provides 64-bit security against message forgery
   and AES_256_GCM and AES_256_CCM only provide 128-bit security against
   message forgery.

   Use of Pre-Shared Keys of limited entropy (for example, a PSK that is
   relatively short, or was chosen by a human and thus may contain less
   entropy than its length would imply) may allow an active attacker to
   perform a brute-force attack where the attacker attempts to connect
   to the server and tries different keys.  Passive eavesdropping alone
   is not sufficient.  For these reasons the Pre-Shared Keys used for
   authentication MUST have a security level equal or higher than the
   cipher suite used, i.e. at least 128-bit for the AES-128 cipher
   suites and at least 192-bit for the AES-256 cipher suites.
