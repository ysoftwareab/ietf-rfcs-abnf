1.  Introduction

   A number of virtual network security function instances typically
   exist in Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) framework
   [i2nsf-framework].  Since these NSF instances may have different
   security capabilities, it is important to register the security
   capabilities of each NSF instance into the security controller after
   they have been created.  In addition, it is required to instantiate
   NSFs of some required security capabilities on demand.  As an
   example, if additional security capabilities are required to meet the
   new security requirements that an I2NSF user requests, the security
   controller should be able to request the DMS to instantiate NSFs that
   have the required security capabilities.

   This document describes the information model which is required for
   the registration interface between security controller and
   developer's management system to support registration and
   instantiation of NSFs.  It further describes the procedure based on

Internet-Draft  Registration Interface Information Model    October 2017


   the information model which should be performed by the security
   controller and the developer's management system via the registration
   interface.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology described in
   [i2nsf-terminology][capability-im][i2nsf-framework]
   [nsf-triggered-steering].

   o  Network Security Function (NSF): A function that is responsible
      for specific treatment of received packets.  A Network Security
      Function can act at various layers of a protocol stack (e.g., at
      the network layer or other OSI layers).  Sample Network Security
      Service Functions are as follows: Firewall, Intrusion Prevention/
      Detection System (IPS/IDS), Deep Packet Inspection (DPI),
      Application Visibility and Control (AVC), network virus and
      malware scanning, sandbox, Data Loss Prevention (DLP), Distributed
      Denial of Service (DDoS) mitigation and TLS proxy
      [nsf-triggered-steering].

   o  Advanced Inspection/Action: As like the I2NSF information model
      for NSF-facing interface [capability-im], Advanced Inspection/
      Action means that a security function calls another security
      function for further inspection based on its own inspection result
      [nsf-triggered-steering].

   o  Network Security Function Profile (NSF Profile): NSF Profile
      specifies the security and performance capability of an NSF
      instance.  Each NSF instance has its own NSF Profile which
      describes the type of security service it can provide and its
      performance capability. [nsf-triggered-steering].

4.  Objectives

   o  Registering NSF instances from Developer's Management System:
      Depending on system's security requirements, it may require some
      NSFs by default.  In this case, DMS creates these default NSF
      instances without the need of receiving requests from Security
      Controller.  After creating them, DMS notifies Security Controller
      of those NSF instances via registration interface.




Hyun, et al.               Expires May 3, 2018                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft  Registration Interface Information Model    October 2017


   o  Creating an NSF instance to serve another NSF's inspection
      request: In I2NSF framework, an NSF can trigger another type of
      NSF(s) for more advanced security inspection of the traffic.  In
      this case, the next NSF is determined by the current NSF's
      inspection result and client's policy.  However, if there is no
      available NSF instance to serve the former NSF's request, we
      should create an NSF instance by requesting Developer's Management
      System (DMS) through registration interface.

   o  Creating NSF instances required to enforce security policy rules
      from Client: In I2NSF framework, users decide which security
      service is necessary in the system.  If there is no NSF instances
      to enforce the client's security policy, then we should also
      create the required instances by requesting DMS via registration
      interface.

5.  Information Model

   The I2NSF registration interface was only used for registering new
   NSF instances to Security Controller.  In this document, however, we
   extend its utilization to support on demand NSF instantiation/de-
   instantiation and describe the information that should be exchanged
   via the registration interface for the functionality.  Moreover, we
   also define the information model of NSF Profile because, for
   registration interface, NSF Profile (i.e., capabilities of an NSF)
   needs to be clarified so that the components of I2NSF framework can
   exchange the set of capabilities in a standardized manner.  This is
   typically done through the following process:

   1)  Security Controller first recognizes the set of capabilities
       (i.e., NSF Profile) or the signature of a specific NSF required
       or wasted in the current system.

   2)  Developer's Management System (DMS) matches the recognized
       information to an NSF based on the information model definition.

   3)  Developer's Management System creates or eliminates NSFs matching
       with the above information.

   4)  Security Controller can then add/remove the corresponding NSF
       instance to/from its list of available NSF instances in the
       system.

       Figure 1: The Registration Interface Information Model Design

   As illustrated in Figure 1, the information model for Registration
   Interface consists of two sub-models: instance management,
   registration sub-models.  The instance management functionality and
   the registration functionality use NSF Profile to achieve their
   goals.  In this context, NSF Profile is the capability objects that
   describe and/or prescribe inspection capability an NSF instance can
   provide.

5.1.  NSF Instance Managment Mechanism

   For the instance management of NSFs, Security Controller in I2NSF
   framework requires two types of requests: Instantiation Request and
   Deinstantiation Request.  Security Controller sends the request
   messages to DMS when required.  Once receiving the request, DMS
   conducts creating/eliminating the corresponding NSF instance and
   responds Security Controller with the results.

5.2.  NSF Registration Mechanism

   In order to register a new NSF instance, DMS should generate a
   Registration Message to Security Controller.  A Registration Message
   consists of an NSF Profile and an NSF Access Information.  The former

   describes the inspection capability of the new NSF instance and the
   latter is for enabling network access to the new instance from other
   components.  After this registration process, as explained in
   [capability-im], the I2NSF capability interface can conduct
   controlling and monitoring the new registered NSF instance.

5.3.  NSF Access Information

   NSF Access Information contains the followings that are required to
   communicate with an NSF: IPv4 address, IPv6 address, port number, and
   supported transport protocol(s) (e.g., Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN)
   [RFC 7348], Generic Protocol Extension for VXLAN (VXLAN-GPE)
   [draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe-04], Generic Route Encapsulation (GRE),
   Ethernet etc.).  In this document, NSF Access Information is used to
   identify a specific NSF instance (i.e.  NSF Access Information is the
   signature(unique identifier) of an NSF instance in the overall
   system).

5.4.  NSF Profile (Capabilities of an NSF instance)

   NSF Profile basically describes the inspection capabilities of an NSF
   instance.  In Figure 4, we show capability objects of an NSF
   instance.  Following the information model of NSF capabilities
   defiend in [capability-im], we share the same security capabilities:
   Network-Security Capabilities, Content-Security Capabilities, and
   Attack Mitigation Capabilities.  In addition, NSF Profile contains
   the performance capabilities and role-Based access control list (ACL)
   as shown in Figure 4.

5.4.1.  Performance Capabilities

   This information represents the processing capability of an NSF.
   This information can be used to determine whether the NSF is in
   congestion by comparing this with the workload that the NSF currently
   undergoes.  Moreover, this information can specify an available
   amount of each type of resources such as processing power which are
   available on the NSF.  (The registration interface can control the
   usages and limitations of the created instance and make the
   appropriate request according to the status.)  As illustrated in
   Figure 5, this information consists of two items: Processing and
   Bandwidth.  Processing information describes the NSF's available
   processing power.  Bandwidth describes the information about
   available network amount in two cases, outbound, inbound.  This two
   information can be used for the NSF's instance request.

5.4.2.  Role-based Access Control List

   This information specifies access policies of an NSF to determine
   whether to permit or deny the access of an entity to the NSF based on
   the role given to the entity.  Each NSF is associated with a role-
   based access control list (ACL) so that it can determine whether to
   permit or deny the access request from an entity.  Figure 6 and
   Figure 7 show the structure of the role-based ACL, which is composed
   of role-id, access-type, and permit/deny.  The role-id identifies
   roles of entities (e.g., administrator, developer etc.).  The access-
   type identifies the specific type of access requests such as NSF rule
   configuration/update and NSF monitoring.  Consequently, the role-
   based ACL in Figure 6 and Figure 7 specifies a set of access-types to
   be permitted and to be denied by each role-id.

6.  Security Considerations

   The information model of the registration interface is based on the
   I2NSF framework without any architectural changes.  Thus, this
   document shares the security considerations of the I2NSF framwork
   that are specified in [i2nsf-framework] for the purpose of achieving
   secure communication between components in the proposed architecture.

Appendix A.  Changes from draft-hyun-i2nsf-registration-interface-im-02

   The following changes are made from draft-hyun-i2nsf-registration-
   interface-im-02:

   o  We added the contents of role-based ACL to NSF profile.

   o  We simplified the performance capability by abstracting away the
      details of each type of resources.

   o  We replaced the existing dynamic life cycle management with the
      instance management.

   o  The references were updated to reflect the latest documents.
