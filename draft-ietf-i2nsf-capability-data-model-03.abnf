   o  If network manager wants to apply security policy rules about
      blocking malicious users, it is a tremendous burden to apply all
      of these rules to NSFs one by one.  This problem can be resolved
      by managing the capabilities of NSFs.  If network manager wants to
      block malicious users with IPv6, network manager sends the
      security policy rules about blocking the users to Network Operator
      Mgmt System using I2NSF user (i.e., a web browser or a software).
      When the Network Operator Mgmt System receives the security policy
      rules, it automatically sends that security policy rules to
      appropriate NSFs (i.e., NSF-m in Developer Mgmt System A and NSF-1
      in Developer Mgmt System B) which can support the capabilities
      (i.e., IPv6).  Therefore, I2NSF User need not consider NSFs where
      to apply the rules.

   o  If NSFs find the malicious packets, it is a tremendous burden for
      network manager to apply the rule about blocking the malicious
      packets to NSFs one by one.  This problem can be resolved by
      managing the capabilities of NSFs.  If NSFs find the suspicious
      packets with IPv4, they can ask the Network Operator Mgmt System
      for information about the suspicious packets with IPv4.  to alter
      specific rules and/or configurations.  When the Network Operator
      Mgmt System receives information, it inspects the information
      about the suspicious packets with IPv4.  If the suspicious packets
      are determined to be malicious packets, the Network Operator Mgmt
      System creates and sends the security policy rule against
      malicious packets to appropriate NSFs (i.e., NSF-1 in Developer
      Mgmt System A and NSF-1 and NSF-n in Developer Mgmt System B)
      which can support the capabilities (i.e., IPv4).  Therefore, the
      new security policy rule against malicious packets can be applied
      to appropriate NSFs without intervention of humans.
