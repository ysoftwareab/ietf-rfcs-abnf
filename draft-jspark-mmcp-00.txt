1. Introduction 

   This document is a part of the ITU-T Recommendation and ISO/IEC 
   International Standard, named the Mobile Multicast Communications 
   Protocol (MMCP). The MMCP is a protocol that can be used to support a 
   variety of multimedia multicasting services in the IP-based wireless 
   mobile networks. The MMCP is targeted at the real-time one-to-many 
   multicast services and applications over mobile communications 
   networks. 

   In MMCP, Session Manager is at the heart of multicast communications. 
   It is responsible for overall control by governing the session join 
   and handover support operations. 

   The MMCP has a characteristic as follows. The MMCP operates on the 
   IP-based network. The MMCP easy integrates the existing IP-based 
   schemes and protocols required for realization of the MMC services. 
   And MMCP has separation of the control channel from the data channel.

3. Protocol Overview 

   The MMCP is Mobile Multicast Control Protocol, which is based on the 
   Mobile Multicast Communications Framework (MMCF). MMCP designed to 
   support one-to-many multicast applications running over multicast-
   capable networks. MMCP operates over IPv4/IPv6 networks that have the 
   IP multicast forwarding capability with the help of IGMP and IP 
   multicast routing protocols. MMCP considers real-time service and 
   handover schemes. MMCP could possibly be provisioned over UDP or TCP.

   A Multicast Contents Server (MCS) transmits multicast data to many 
   Mobile Nodes (MNs) using the legacy UDP/IP multicasting. For the 
   control purpose of the multicast data transport, a MMCP session is 
   established between a Session Manager (SM) and MNs, possibly with one 
   or more Local Mobility Controllers (LMCs) between SM and MNs. The SM 
   is used to perform the overall control operations for the MMCP 
   session, and it shall be interworking with MCS. The LMC is used to 
   locally control a part of MNs participating in the session, which is 
   for scalability enhancement of the MMCP operations. Each MN 
   represents a receiving user for mobile multicast applications. 

    

4. Design Considerations 

   This section describes some considerations for the design of MMCP. 

4.1. Design Principles 

   This section describes the design of the MMCP for MMC services and 
   applications over wireless mobile networks as well as the fixed 
   communications networks. For this purpose, the MMCP shall be designed 
   with the following design principles: 

   -  Generic IP-based control schemes for MMC 

   -  Easy integration of legacy multicast applications with MMCP 

   -  Separation of the control channel from the data channel 

   -  Interworking with the conventional protocols for security and 
     authentication/authorization

4.2. Functional Entities 

4.2.1. Mobile Node (MN) 

   A Mobile Node represents a multicast receiving user for the mobile 
   multicast application in the MMC networks. A MN will receive the MMC 
   services from the Multicast Contents Server (MCS) in the network 
   using the MMCP. Each MN may connect to the MMC session from the 
   wireless or wired access networks. In either case, the identical MMC 
   services will be provided. 

4.2.2. Multicast Contents Server (MCS) 

   The Multicast Contents Server is a single multicast data sender in a 
   MMC session. When a MMC session starts, the MCS will begin to send 
   the multicast data to the promising MNs in the network, using IP 
   multicast. 

4.2.3. Session Manager (SM) 

   The Session Manager is a functional entity that performs the overall 
   control operations for a MMC session. The SM shall be interworking 
   with the corresponding MCS for the MMC session. The authentication 
   and authorization step for a newly joining MN will possibly be 
   implemented by interworking with an appropriate AAA server. 

   The SM may be implemented either on the same machine with MCS or 
   separately on the different machine. It is noted that the SM and MCS 
   perform the different functionality. SM manages the overall control 
   functionality for the MMC session, whereas the MCS is the multicast 
   sender in the data transport plane. 

4.2.4. Local Mobility Controller (LMC) 

   For scalability of the MMC functional operations and also for any 
   reason of deployment of MMC services, one or more Local Mobility 
   Controller may be used for the session. From the functionality point 
   of view, the SM and LMC are identical during the session. 

   When a MN contacts with the SM to join a MMC session, the SM may 
   assign an appropriate LMC to the MN, after processing the session 
   join procedure. After that, the MN will now contact with the LMC 
   instead of the SM for all of the MMC control operations. 

   That is, during the session, the LMC is responsible for the control 
   operations (status monitoring and mobility support) through

   interworking with the MNs. The monitored status information on the 
   session and MNs will be delivered to the SM. 

    

5. Packets 

   A MMCP packet contains a 12-byte base header together with body 
   packets. 

   In this section, we describe a brief sketch of the MMCP packet format. 

5.1. Base Header 

   The base header contains the following information: 

   Packet Type (8bits) 

   It indicates the type of this MMCP packet. The encoding values of the 
   MMCP packets are described in Table 1. 

   MMCP Version (4bits) 

   This field indicates the version of MMCP. At present, the value is 
   v.1 (0001). 

   MN Length (4bits) 

   This value indicates the length of the MMC user identification in 
   word. Unit of word is 4-bytes. 

   Payload Length (16bits) 

   This value indicates the total length of the body in byte, following 
   the base header. 

   Error Code (6bits) 

   It is an error code bit for representation of the MMCP protocol 
   error: 

   No Error (000000) 

   Session Join Reject (000001) 

   Monitoring Error (000010)

Internet-Draft    MMCP for IP Multicast in Mobile Networks     May 2007 
    

   Handover Error (000100) 

   N (1bit) 

   It is a flag bit for new LMC address. The use of this flag depends on 
   the packet types: 

   For the SJC (Session Join Confirm), the HIC (Handover Initiation 
   Confirm) packets, the N is set to 1 indicates that new Local Mobility 
   Controller address is exist. N is set to 0, otherwise. 

   F (1bit) 

   It is a flag bit for confirm message. The use of this flag depends on 
   the packet types: 

   For the SJC (Session Join Confirm), LJC (Local Join Confirm), ULC 
   (User Leave Confirm), HIC (Handover Initiation Confirm) packets, the 
   F is set to 1 indicates that each of the corresponding request is 
   accepted. F is set to 0, otherwise. 

   Reserved (24bits) 

   This field is reserved for future use. 

   Session ID (32bits) 

   This field is used to identify a MMCP session by the Mobile Node. It 
   may also be used to verify the session. In the session setup phase, 
   this information must first be informed by Session Manager. 

5.2. Packet Formats 

   MMCP defines the total 15 packet types. The following table 
   summarizes the packets used in MMCP.

6. Procedures 

6.1. Session Join 

   Session Join is procedure that MN receives multicast content from MCS. 
   After Session Join procedure is divided into two scenarios. It is 
   that either LMC exist or not. 

   First of all, the scenario is that LMC exist as follow. MN sends a 
   SJR message to the SM for Session Join. When the SM receives the SJR 
   message, the SM identifies an authenticated user from Authentication

Internet-Draft    MMCP for IP Multicast in Mobile Networks     May 2007 
    

   Server (AS) and database. Authentication processing is used by AS and 
   DB, which is out of scope. 

   If MN is an authenticated user, the SM sends a SJC message that 
   includes setting f flag to 1 at base header of packet and MCS, LMC 
   information at body of packet. The MN sends a LJR message to address 
   of received LMC. After join processing, the LMC sends corresponding 
   LJC message to MN. This procedure finishes a Session Join. If MN is 
   not an authenticated user, the SM sends a SJC message that includes 
   setting f flag to 0 at base header packet only. The Session Join 
   procedure is operating Join Waiting Time (JWT). The Session Join 
   procedures shall be finished until JWT timer is expired. If JWT timer 
   is expired, MN considers that Session Join procedure is failed. 

6.2. User Leave 

   User Leave is procedure that user leave session when receives content. 
   MN sends an ULR message to LMC. After leave processing, the LMC sends 
   an ULC message to MN. 

6.3. Status Monitoring 

   Status Monitoring is procedure for identifying status of the MNs or 
   LMCs and checking the handover information. And it sends QoS 
   information to upper controller. Status Monitoring is classified two 
   scenarios, LMC exist and LMC does not exist. 

   First of all, the scenario is that LMC exist as follow. MN sends an 
   USR message to the LMC for Status Monitoring. The MN sends 
   periodically the USR message to the LMC by Status Report Generation 
   Time (SCT) of the MN. When the LMC receives the USR message, the LMC 
   sends a SRA message to the MN for response. 

   In order to SM has information of MNs, the LMC sends an ASR message 
   to the SM. The ASR message is aggregated with information of MNs. The 
   LMC also sends periodically the ASR message to the SM by SGT timer of 
   the LMC. When the SM receives the ASR message, the SM sends a SRA 
   message to the LM for response. 

   The LMC and SM operate Status Probe Time (SPT). If the LMC does not 
   receive an USR message from the MN or the SM does not receive an ASR 
   message from the LMC by expired SPT timer, the LMC or SM will send 
   the USP message to the MN or LMC. If the responding USR or ASR 
   message has not arrived until RXT timer expires, the LMC or SM 
   retransmit USR or ASR message. The MN or LMC regards termination, if 
   MN or LMC does not response for four sending USR or ASR message.

6.4. Mobility Support 

   In handover operation, the MN will send a HIR message to old LMC and 
   waits for the HIC message until the Handover Waiting Time (HWT) 
   expires. The old LMC sends a HIP message to the MN and finds new LMC 
   for the information of the MN to transmit. The old LMC sends a HCT 
   message to new LMC and waits for the HTA message until the RXT timer 
   expires. The new LMC updates transmitted information of the MN from 
   old LMC, and then sends a HTA message to old LMC. The old LMC 
   receives the HTA message, then sends the HIC message to the MN if the 
   responding HIC message has not arrived until HWT timer expires, the 
   MN may send the HIR message again. And if the responding HTA message 
   has not arrived until RXT timer expires, the old LMC may send the HCT 
   message again. 

   The MN will send a LJR message to the new LMC and waits for the LJC 
   message until the RXT timer expires. When the new LMC received the 
   LJR message, the new LMC sends an ASR message to the SM at next 
   transmission time. The SM updates modified information of the new LMC, 
   and then sends a SPA message to the new LMC.

9. Conclusions 

   This document describes the Mobile Multicast Communications Protocol 
   (MMCP). The MMCP is a protocol that can be used to support a variety 
   of multimedia multicasting services in the IP-based wireless mobile 
   networks. The MMCP is targeted at the real-time one-to-many multicast 
   services and applications over mobile communications networks. The 
   MMCP benefits are that the MMCP is integrated with legacy multicast 
   applications and used for separation the control channel from the 
   data channel.

APPENDIX A: Timers 

   This appendix summarizes the timers used for MMCP for information. 

A.1. JWT (Join Waiting Time) 

   The JWT timer is used for session join procedures. When session 
   starts, MN will send a SJR packet to the SM. and the MN waits for the 
   SJC packet until the JWT timer expires. If LMC exist, MN will send a 
   LJR packet to the LMC. And the MN waits for the LJC packet until the 
   JWT timer expires. When the timer expires and the corresponding 
   packet has not arrived until then, it may consider that session join 
   procedure is failed. 

   A specific value of JWT timer depends on the implementation. 

A.2. SGT (Status Report Generation Time) 

   Each MN or LMC transmits the USR packet to its upper system every SGT 
   timer. If upper system does not receive the USR packet, upper system 
   will send an USP packet to the lower system. 

   A specific value of SGT timer depends on the implementation. 

A.3. SPT (Status Probe Time) 

   An USP packet is message that LMC or SM checks MN or LMC alive. If 
   the USR packet does not receive until SPT timer expires, USP packet 
   sends. 

   A specific value of SPT timer depends on the implementation. 

A.4. HWT (Handover Waiting Time) 

   The HWT timer is used by handover packet: HIR. When handover starts, 
   MN will send HIR packet to LMC or SM. And the MN waits for the HIC 
   packet until the HWT timer expires. When the timer expires and the 
   corresponding packet has not arrived until then, it may send the HIR 
   packet again. 

   A specific value of HWT timer depends on the implementation. 

A.5. RXT (Retransmission Time) 

   The RXT timer is used by the packet initiator to wait for the 
   corresponding confirm packet or ACK packet. For example, a joiner MN 
   sends SJR packet to SM and the MN waits for the SJC packet until the

   RXT timer expires. When the timer expires and the confirm packet has 
   not arrived until then, it may send the request packet again. 

   A specific value of RXT timer depends on the implementation.
