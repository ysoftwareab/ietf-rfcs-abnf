 Generic YANG Data Model for Connectionless Operations, Administration,
                     and Maintenance(OAM) protocols
               draft-ietf-lime-yang-connectionless-oam-05

Abstract

   This document presents a base YANG Data model for connectionless
   Operations Administration, and Maintenance(OAM) protocols.  It
   provides a technology-independent abstraction of key OAM constructs
   for connectionless protocols.  The base model presented here can be
   extended to include technology specific details.  This is leading to
   uniformity between OAM protocols and support both nested OAM
   workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at different or same levels
   through a unified interface).

1.  Introduction

   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) are important
   networking functions that allow operators to:

   1.  Monitor networks connections (Reachability Verification,
       Continuity Check).

   2.  Troubleshoot failures (Fault verification and localization).

   3.  Monitor Performance

   An overview of OAM tools is presented at [RFC7276].

   Ping and Traceroute [RFC792], [RFC4443] are well-known fault
   verification and isolation tools, respectively, for IP networks.
   Over the years, different technologies have developed similar tools
   for similar purposes.

   The different OAM tools may support connection-oriented technologies
   or connectionless technologies.  In connection-oriented technologies,
   a connection is established prior to the transmission of data.  In
   connectionless technologies, data is typically sent between end
   points without prior arrangement [RFC7276].  Note that the
   Connection-Oriented OAM YANG DATA model is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-lime-yang-oam-model].

   In this document, we presents a base YANG Data model for
   connectionless OAM protocols.  The generic YANG model for
   connectionless OAM only includes configuration data and state data.
   It can be used in conjunction with data retrieval method model
   [I-D.ietf-lime-yang-connectionless-oam-methods], which focuses on
   data retrieval procedures like RPC.  However it also can be used
   independently of data retrieval method model.

   o  data node

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC6020].

2.1.  Terminology

   TP - Test Point

   MAC - Media Access Control

   BFD - Bidirectional Forwarding Detection

   RPC - A Remote Procedure Call, as used within the NETCONF protocol

   CC - Continuity Check [RFC7276] , Continuity Checks are used to
   verify that a destination is reachable and therefore also referred to
   as reachability verification

3.  Overview of the Connectionless OAM Model

   At the top of the model, there is an 'cc-oper-data' container for
   session statistics.  Grouping is also defined for common session
   statistics and these are applicable for proactive OAM sessions.
   Multiple 'test-point-locations' keyed using technology specific keys
   (eg., IPv4 address for IPv4 locations) are possible by augmented
   network nodes which are defined in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo]
   to describe the network hierarchies and the inventory of nodes
   contained in a network.  Each 'test-point-location' is chosen based
   on 'location-type' which when chosen, leads to a container that
   includes a list of 'test-point-locations' keyed by technology
   specific keys.  Each test point location includes a 'test-point-
   location-info'.  The 'test-point-location-info' includes 'tp-
   technology', 'tp-tools', and 'connectionless-oam-layers'.  The
   groupings of 'tp-address' and 'tp-address-vrf' are kept out of 'test-
   point-location-info' to make it addressing agnostic and allow varied
   composition.  Depending upon the choice of the 'location-type'
   (determined by the 'tp-address-vrf'), the containers differ in its
   composition of 'test-point-locations' while the 'test-point-location-
   info', is a common aspect of every 'test-point-location'.  The vrf is
   used to describe the corresponding network instance.  The 'tp-
   technology' indicate OAM technology details.  The 'tp-tools' describe
   the OAM tools supported.  The 'connectionless-oam-layers' is used to
   describe the relationship of one test point with other test points.
   The level in 'oam-layers' indicate whether related OAM test point is
   The level in oam-layers indicate whether related oam test point is in
   client layer(lower layer described in section 3.3), server layer
   (upper layer described in section 3.3) or the same layer as the

   current test point under Test point Locations.  The model is
   augmented to "/nd:networks/nd:network/nd:node" using 'test-point-
   locations' defined below.

3.1.  TP Address

   In connectionless OAM, the tp address is defined with the following
   type:

   o  MAC address [RFC6136]

   o  IPv4 or IPv6 address

   o  TP-attribute

   o  System-id to represent the device or
      node.[I-D.ietf-spring-sr-yang]

   To define a forwarding treatment of a test packet, the 'tp-address'
   needs to be associated with additional parameters, e.g.  DSCP for IP
   or TC for MPLS.  In generic connectionless OAM YANG model, these
   parameters are not explicit configured.  The model user can add
   corresponding parameters according to their requirements.

3.2.  Tools

   The different OAM tools may be used in one of two basic types of
   activation: proactive and on-demand.  The proactive OAM refers to OAM
   actions which are carried out continuously to permit proactive
   reporting of fault.  The proactive OAM method requires persistent
   configuration.  The on-demand OAM refers to OAM actions which are
   initiated via manual intervention for a limited time to carry out
   diagnostics.  The on-demand OAM method requires only transient
   configuration.[RFC7276] [G.8013].  In connectionless OAM, 'session-
   type' is defined to indicate which kind of activation will be used by
   the current session.

   In connectionless OAM, the tools attribute is used to describe a
   toolset for fault detection and isolation.  And it can serve as a
   constraint condition when the base model be extended to specific OAM
   technology.  For example, to fulfill the ICMP PING configuration, the
   "../coam:continuity-check" should be set to "true", and then the lime
   base model should be augmented with ICMP PING specific details.

3.3.  OAM-layers

   As typical networks have a multi-layer architecture, the set of OAM
   protocols similarly take a multi-layer structure; each layer may has
   its own OAM protocol [RFC7276] and is corresponding to specific
   administrative domain or path and has associated test points.  OAM-
   layers is referred to a list of server layer, client layer that are
   related to current test point.  This allows users to easily navigate
   between related layer to efficiently troubleshoot a "loss of
   continuity defect".  In this model, we have kept level default as 0,
   when all test points are located at the same layer.  'Level' defines
   the relative technology level in a sequence of administrative
   domains, and is provided to allow correlation of faults in related
   OAM domains.  For example, there is a network in which data traffic
   between two customer edges is transported over three consecutive
   administrative domains, where the current test point is located in
   the second administrative domain.  In this scenario second
   administrative domain is acting as client to first administrative
   domain and server to third administrative domain.  For Test Point at
   second administrative domain, client level is "-1", i.e. third
   administrative domain and server level is "1", i.e. first
   administrative domain.  In another example, if the first
   administrative domain and the second are in same level then it's
   upstream or downstream administrative domain scenario and thus second
   administrative domain level is set to "0".

                list oam-layers {
                  key "index";
                  leaf index {
                     type uint16 {
                        range "0..65535";
                     }
                  }
                  leaf level {
                      type int32 {
                           range "-1..1";
                      }

                        "Level";
                  }

                     "List of related oam layers.";

3.4.  Test Point Locations Information

   This is a generic grouping for Test Point Locations Information.  It
   Provide details of Test Point Location using Tools, 'OAM-Layers'
   grouping defined above.

3.5.  Test Point Locations

   This is a generic grouping for Test Point Locations.  Choice
   statement is used to define locations types, for example 'ipv4-
   location-type', 'ipv6-location-type', etc.  Container is defined
   under each location type containing list keyed to test point address,
   Test Point Location Information defined in section above, and routing
   instance VRF name if required.

3.6.  Path Discovery Data

   This is a generic grouping for path discovery data model that can be
   retrieved by any data retrieval methods including RPCs.  Path
   discovery data output from methods, includes 'src-test-point', 'dst-
   test-point', 'sequence-number', 'hop-cnt', session statistics of
   various kinds, path verification and path trace related information.
   Path discovery includes data to be retrieved on a 'per-hop' basis via
   a list of 'path-trace-info-list' which includes information like
   'timestamps', 'ingress-interface', 'egress-interface' and 'app-meta-
   data'.  The path discovery data model is made generic enough to allow
   different methods of data retrieval.  None of the fields are made
   mandatory for that reason.  Noted that the retrieval methods are
   defined in [I-D.ietf-lime-yang-connectionless-oam-methods].

3.7.  Continuity Check Data

   This is a generic grouping for continuity check data model that can
   be retrieved by any data retrieval methods including RPCs.
   Continuity check data output from methods, includes 'src-test-point',
   'dst-test-point', 'sequence-number', 'hop-cnt' and session statistics
   of various kinds.  The continuity check data model is made generic
   enough to allow different methods of data retrieval.  None of the
   fields are made mandatory for that reason.  Noted that the retrieval
   methods are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-lime-yang-connectionless-oam-methods].

5.  Connectionless model applicability

   "ietf-connectionless-oam" model defined in this document provides
   technology-independent abstraction of key OAM constructs for
   connectionless protocols.  This model can be further extended to
   include technology specific details, e.g., adding new data nodes with
   technology specific functions and parameters into proper anchor
   points of the base model, so as to develop a technology-specific
   connectionless OAM model.

   This section demonstrates the usability of the connectionless YANG
   OAM data model to various connectionless OAM technologies, e.g., BFD,
   LSP ping.  Note that, in this section, we only present several
   snippets of technology-specific model extensions for illustrative

   purposes.  The complete model extensions should be worked on in
   respective protocol working groups.

5.1.  BFD Extension

5.1.1.  Augment Method

   The following sections shows how the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model
   can be extended to cover BFD technology.  For this purpose, a set of
   extension are introduced such as technology-type extension and test-
   point attributes extension.

   Note that in BFD WG, there is a BFD yang data model
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-yang] to be produced.  Users can choose to use "ietf-
   connectioless-oam" as basis and augment the "ietf-connectionless-oam"
   model with bfd specific details.  The bfd specific details can be the
   grouping defined in the BFD model.

5.1.1.1.  Technology type extension

   No BFD technology type has been defined in the "ietf-connectionless-
   oam" model.  Therefore a technology type extension is required in the
   model Extension.

   The snippet below depicts an example of augmenting "bfd" type into
   the ietf-connectionless-oam":

   augment "/nd:networks/nd:network/nd:node/"
   +"coam:location-type/coam:ipv4-location-type"
   +"/coam:test-point-ipv4-location-list/"
          +"coam:test-point-locations/coam:technology"
   +"/coam:technology-string"
   {
       leaf bfd{
      type string;
     }

5.1.1.2.  Test point attributes extension

   To support bfd technology, the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model can be
   extended and add bfd specific parameters under "test-point-location"
   list and/or add new location type such as "bfd over MPLS-TE" under
   "location-type".

5.1.1.2.1.  Define and insert new nodes into corresponding test-point-
            location

   In the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model, multiple "test-point-
   location" lists are defined under the "location-type" choice node.
   Therefore, to derive a model for some bfd technologies ( such as ip
   single-hop, ip multi-hops, etc), data nodes for bfd specific details
   need to be added into corresponding "test-point-locations" list.  In
   this section, we reuse some groupings which are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-yang] as following:

   The snippet below shows how the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model can
   be extended to support "BFD IP single-hop":

   augment "/nd:networks/nd:network/nd:node/"
   +"coam:location-type/coam:ipv4-location-type"
   +"/coam:test-point-ipv4-location-list/"
           +"coam:test-point-locations"
   {
           container session-cfg {
             description "BFD IP single-hop session configuration";
             list sessions {
               key "interface dest-addr";
               description "List of IP single-hop sessions";
               leaf interface {
                 type if:interface-ref;
                 description
                   "Interface on which the BFD session is running.";
               }
               leaf dest-addr {
                 type inet:ip-address;
                 description "IP address of the peer";
               }
               uses bfd:bfd-grouping-common-cfg-parms;
               uses bfd:bfd-grouping-echo-cfg-parms;
             }
           }
   }

   Similar augmentations can be defined to support other BFD
   technologies such as BFD IP multi-hop, BFD over MPLS, etc.

5.1.1.2.2.  Add new location-type cases

   In the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model, If there is no appropriate
   "location type" case that can be extended, a new "location-type" case
   can be defined and inserted into the "location-type" choice node.

   Therefore, the model user can flexibly add "location-type" to support
   other type of test point which are not defined in the "ietf-
   connectionless-oam" model.  In this section, we add a new "location-
   type" case and reuse some groupings which are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-yang] as follows:

   The snippet below shows how the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model can
   be extended to support "BFD over MPLS-TE":

   augment "/nd:networks/nd:network/nd:node/coam:location-type"{
    case te-location{
     list test-point-location-list{
      key "tunnel-name";
      leaf tunnel-name{
       type leafref{
    path "/te:te/te:tunnels/te:tunnel/te:name";
   }
   description
   "point to a te instance.";
      }
       uses bfd:bfd-grouping-common-cfg-parms;
           uses bfd-mpls:bfd-encap-cfg;
     }
    }
   }

   Similar augmentations can be defined to support other BFD
   technologies such as BFD over LAG, etc.

5.1.2.  Schema Mount

   And another alternative method is using schema mount mechanism
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-schema-mount] in the "ietf-connectionless-oam".
   Within the "test-point-location" list, a "root" attribute is defined
   to provide a mounted point for models mounted per "test-point-
   location".  Therefore, the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model can
   provide a place in the node hierarchy where other OAM YANG data
   models can be attached, without any special extension in the "ietf-
   connectionless-oam" YANG data models [I-D.ietf-netmod-schema-mount].
   Note that the limitation of the Schema Mount method is it is not
   allowed to specify certain modules that are required to be mounted
   under a mount point.

   The snippet below depicts the definition of "root" attribute.

          description

         }

   The following section shows how the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model
   can use schema mount to support BFD technology.

5.1.2.1.  BFD Modules be populated in schema-mount

5.2.  LSP ping extension

5.2.1.  Augment Method

   The following sections shows how the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model
   can be extended to support LSP ping technology.  For this purpose, a
   set of extension are introduced such as technology-type extension and
   test-point attributes extension.

   Note that in MPLS WG, there is a LSP Ping yang data model
   [I-D.zheng-mpls-lsp-ping-yang-cfg] to be produced.  Users can choose
   to use "ietf-connectioless-oam" as basis and augment the "ietf-
   connectionless-oam" model with LSP Ping specific details in the model
   extension.  The LSP Ping specific details can be the grouping defined
   in the LSP ping model.

5.2.1.1.  Technology type extension

   No lsp-ping technology type has been defined in the "ietf-
   connectionless-oam" model.  Therefore a technology type extension is
   required in the model extension.

   The snippet below depicts an example of augmenting the "ietf-
   connectionless-oam" with "lsp-ping" type:

   +"/coam:technology-string"
   {
      leaf lsp-ping{
      type string;
     }
   }

5.2.1.2.  Test point attributes extension

   To support lsp-ping, the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model can be
   extended and add lsp-ping specific parameters can be defined and
   under "test-point-location" list.

   User can reuse the attributes or groupings which are defined in
   [I-D.zheng-mpls-lsp-ping-yang-cfg] as follows:

   The snippet below depicts an example of augmenting the "test-point-
   locations" list with lsp ping attributes:

   augment "/nd:networks/nd:network/nd:node/"
   +"coam:location-type/coam:ipv4-location-type"
   +"/coam:test-point-ipv4-location-list/"
           +"coam:test-point-locations"
   {
   list lsp-ping {
            key "lsp-ping-name";
            leaf lsp-ping-name {
             type string {
               length "1..31";

   Note that the limitation of the Schema Mount method is it is not
   allowed to specify certain modules that are required to be mounted

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed via
   the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the
   secure transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is SSH [RFC6242].  The NETCONF access control model
   [RFC6536] provides the means to restrict access for particular
   NETCONF users to a pre-configured subset of all available NETCONF
   protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG module which are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g. <edit-config>)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.

   The vulnerable "config true" subtrees and data nodes are the
   following:

   /nd:networks/nd:network/nd:node/coam:location-type/coam:ipv4-
   location-type/coam:test-point-ipv4-location-list/coam:test-point-
   locations/

   /nd:networks/nd:network/nd:node/coam:location-type/coam:ipv6-
   location-type/coam:test-point-ipv6-location-list/coam:test-point-
   locations/

   /nd:networks/nd:network/nd:node/coam:location-type/coam:mac-location-
   type/coam:test-point-mac-address-location-list/coam:test-point-
   locations/

   id-location-type/coam:test-point-system-info-location-list/coam:test-
   point-locations/

   Unauthorized access to any of these lists can adversely affect OAM
   management system handling of end-to-end OAM and coordination of OAM
   within underlying network layers.  This may lead to inconsistent
   configuration, reporting, and presentation for the OAM mechanisms
   used to manage the network.
