Internet-Draft    LDAP Administrator Address Attribute       August 2006


Abstract

   Organizations running multiple directory servers need an ability for
   administrators to determine who is responsible for a particular
   server.  An attribute, conceptually similar to the 'sysContact'
   object of SNMP, is defined which can retrieved from the directory
   server using the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.

Internet-Draft    LDAP Administrator Address Attribute       August 2006


1.  Introduction

   This document defines an optional attribute for use in LDAP [1].

   This attribute was originally defined in the mid-1990s for inclusion
   in the LDAPv3 data model, but was omitted from the LDAPv3 root DSE
   specification as there was only one implementation of a server
   supporting that attribute at that time.

   The words "MUST", "SHOULD" and "MAY" are used as defined in RFC 2119
   [2].

   Please send comments to the author at mark.wahl@informed-control.com.

Internet-Draft    LDAP Administrator Address Attribute       August 2006


2.  The administratorsAddress attribute

   This attribute allows a server administrator to provide the contact
   information of the responsible party for an LDAP server or naming
   context.  This can be used by management clients which are, for
   example, checking the state of a replication or referral topology, to
   provide a way for the user of the management client to send email to
   manager of a particular server.

   The attribute is defined as follows (with lines wrapped for
   readability):

     ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.101.120.1 NAME 'administratorsAddress'
      SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.26
      USAGE directoryOperation )

   This attribute can contain one or more values, and each value is a
   URI [3].  Each URI is encoded using the IA5 string syntax [5].

   Unlike the labeledURI attribute [6], these values do not have a
   label.

   This document only specifies how a client can read this attribute.
   Some servers MAY support updating this attribute over protocol,
   subject to access control, however for many servers it is anticipated
   that the values of this attribute would be configured through the
   server's out-of-band management interface, such as in a configuration
   file.

   In existing practice, this URI is commonly of the 'mailto:' form
   identifying a role mail address, such as
   "mailto:helpdesk@example.com".

   To obtain the responsible party for a directory server, the attribute
   is read from the root DSE, using a baseObject search as described in
   RFC 4512 [4].

   To obtain the responsible party for a naming context, the attribute
   is read from the entry at the base of the naming context.  Note that
   these addresses need not be the same as that of the directory server
   administrator, or of a data administrator.

3.  Security Considerations

   The server's access control policy SHOULD allow this information to
   be visible to any suitable administrator in the same organization.
   Since one use of this attribute is to find who is responsible if the
   server is not making authentication decisions properly, it MAY be
   visible to all users who are permitted to access the directory
   server.  The administrator SHOULD choose addresses for use in this
   attribute that are already publically known within the organization,
   and SHOULD NOT encode passwords or other secret information within
   the URIs.
