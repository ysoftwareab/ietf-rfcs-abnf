1.  Introduction

   In the 5G era, great change of the basic wireless network
   architecture from RRU-BBU to AAU-DU-CU brings the change of 5G
   transport network from fronthaul-backhaul to fronthaul-middlehaul-
   backhaul network.  Moreover, to avoid excessive transmission
   bandwidth requirement, the CPRI interface evolves to eCPRI interface.

   Contemporaneously, the Centralized, Collaborative, Cloud and Clean
   Radio Access Network architecture (C-RAN) have been actively deployed
   instead of the previous D-RAN architecture by several operators.  For
   example, the medium-scale C-RAN centralized with 10 base stations
   will become the main scenario for 5G network, according to the
   statistics of different provinces in China.  It is noted that the
   transmission distance will be increased from a few hundred meters for
   D-RAN to up to 10km for C-RAN (typically 5~10km).  As the degree of
   centralization increases and the distance from AAU to DU becomes
   longer, the complexity of control and operation and maintenance will
   greatly increased.

   The traditional front-haul solutions will not meet the requirements
   of C-RAN, such as the traditional fibre direct connection solution
   which requires 12 fibres for six duplex modules of one base station
   and occupies large fiber resources for medium and large scale C-RAN.
   However, if using WDM technology, a basic fronthaul requirement of a
   5G base station with 12-channels can be satisfied by one fiber.  A
   lot of fiber resource would be saved.

   For 5G C-RAN front-haul network, several front-haul transport schemes
   based on WDM technology have been proposed to solve the lack of fiber
   core, including passive WDM, active WDM, and semi-active WDM.

   The passive WDM system is composed of WDM optical modules and a pair
   of passive de/multiplexer at both AAU and DU sides, which has the
   advantages of low cost, flexible deployment, etc.  However, the
   passive equipments cannot support on-line management.  The potential
   fault points should be manually processed one by one, including
   optical modules, WDM de/multiplexer, branch fibers between optical
   modules and WDM de/multiplexer, trunk fibers between a pair of WDM
   de/multiplexer.  This result in long fault detection and service
   disruption time.

   The active WDM scheme is composed of a pair of active WDM equipments
   at both AAU and DU sides and can perform powerful OAM functions, but
   the system cost is sharply increased and the deployment of the active
   equipment at AAU side is limited by power supply.

   The semi-active WDM solution with a passive AAU side and active DU
   side not only greatly reduces the pressure of optical fiber
   resources, but also has the advantages in cost (compared with the
   active solution), management and protection of the front-haul network
   (compared with the passive solution).  It helps operators to build 5G
   fronthaul networks with low cost, high bandwidth and fast deployment.
   A centralized transmission controller could manage all the semi-
   active WDM systems in a large zone.

2.  Architecture for Semi-active Front-haul WDM

   The semi-active WDM system is composed by a passive AAU side with
   colored optical modules and passive BiDi WDM like MUX/DEMUX, and an
   active DU side with active WDM equipment and modules.  The active WDM
   equipment should be composed by passive BiDi WDM, microprocessor unit
   and OAM modulation/demodulation unit.  There are some mangement
   challenges of semi-active WDM system that need to be resolved.  Since
   the the AAU and DU are both wireless devices and could not be managed
   by transmission controller, the management of optical modules at AAU/

   DU side is difficult and special.  Because of the passive AAU side,
   the management of passive AAU side have to be done through the active
   DU side.

   One of workable solutions is introduced below.  An OAM channel in the
   semi-active WDM solution could be implemented by service signal
   overhead or pilot tone with the low modulation depth of the optical
   channel signal.  The OAM channel is used to transmit management and
   control information between the AAU side and the DU side.  The active
   WDM equipment could send management requests to the AAU and manage
   the optical modules within the AAU, including query and
   configuration.  The optical modules within the AAU can receive
   management requests from the active WDM equipment and then send the
   OAM information of AAU and the optical modules to the active WDM
   equipment automatically or at regular time intervals once the optical
   modules are powered on, including the wavelength, driving voltage,
   driving current, launch power of the transmitter, transceiver optical
   receive power, etc.  The WDM optical modules can add the OAM
   information with the service signals and transport together in the
   same optical channel.  The detection unit in the active WDM equipment
   can demodulate the OAM information, obtain the transmission
   performance of AAU and modules, and then report it to the
   transmission controller.

   The centralized transmission controller for the semi-active WDM
   systems could display of the network topology, equipment, and module
   information, and support fault monitoring of the fronthaul network.
   Fig.2 shows the link failure monitoring functions.  These failures
   could be monitored at branch fibers between optical modules and WDM
   de/multiplexer in AAU side as 1 and 2, branch fibers between optical
   modules and WDM de/multiplexer in DU side as 4 and 5, fiber link as
   3, modules as 6 illustrated in Figure 2.

   There is also a requirement for protection in the semi-active WDM
   solution.  By introducing a splitter and a switch between the remote

   protection like capability.

3.  Model Relationship

   In the semi-active WDM solution, transmission controller is preferred
   to manage WDM equipments and the optical models on AAU and DU.
   Though there are some data models have been defined for the WDM
   management, consider that the AAU and DU are both wireless devices,
   some extensions are needed for the transmission controller to manage
   them.

   For a full-lifecycle management, the traditional NMS function and SDN
   control plane are both required, includes tunnel, topology,
   inventory, alarm and performance management.

   For daily maintenance, e.g. fault location, there is a requirement of
   viewing the whole signal flow.  So the tunnel and topology model are
   necessary in the semi-active WDM system management.  The WDM related
   models existing, like RFC9094, draft-ietf-ccamp-wson-tunnel-model and
   draft-ietf-ccamp-flexgrid-yang etc. are all considered useable in
   semi-active WDM system management.

   It is suggested that the solution and data model in draft-yg3bp-
   ccamp-optical-inventory-yang can be used for inventory management.
   The inventory model is in the first I-D draft version state, let's
   keep tracing on this model.

   Solution and data model in RFC8632 should be used for alarm
   management.  We will do more research on whether is there special
   requirements of semi-active system on alarm management.

   For the performance management, e.g.  OAM and loop-back operations,
   is also required for the semi-active WDM system management.  The
   draft-ietf-teas-actn-pm-telemetry-autonomics defines a generic
   performance management framework.  And the draft-zheng-ccamp-client-
   pm-yang defines an Ethernet over OTN service level performance
   monitoring.  We consider that both of these two models can be used in
   the semi-active WDM management model in the future.

4.  YANG Tree

   We will provide some augmentations on the existing tunnel, topology,
   inventory, alarm and performance models based on our further
   investigation.

5.  YANG Code for Front-haul WDM

   We will provide some augmentations on the existing tunnel, topology,
   inventory, alarm and performance models based on our further
