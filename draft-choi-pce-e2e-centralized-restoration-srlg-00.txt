Abstract



   This draft describes the concept of the Shared Link Risk Group (SRLG) 
   based logical ring configuration and recovery method using ring 
   SRLG for the purpose of restoration in mesh networks. In this 
   restoration architecture, backup paths can be easily established 
   through the end-to-end path which follows from the logical ring 
   configuration. It guarantees the establishment of backup path disjoint 
   from the working path at all levels. To take advantage of bandwidth 
   considerations and fast restoration mechanisms, a centralized Controller 
   is used to provide dedicated protection to Optical Transport Networks 
   using the SRLG concept. The Controller determines the logical rings over 
   mesh optical networks and distributes information about primary and 
   backup paths to the nodes in the optical transport layer.

1. Introduction


   With the rapid growth of the Internet, the advance of wavelength division 
   multiplexing (WDM) technology, and the integration of various communication 
   technologies, the communication network is evolving to include huge 
   bandwidth-intensive network applications. Survivability refers to the ability 
   of the network to transfer the interrupted service onto spare network 
   capacity to circumvent a point of failure in the network and it is a critical 
   requirement for IP over WDM networks. In a WDM network, a link failure, 
   fiber cut, node down may be due to human error or natural disasters leading to 
   the loss of large amount of data and multiple failures of all the optical paths 
   that traverse the fiber. So, we have to develop appropriate recovery 
   architecture and strategies that minimize the data loss when a failure on a 
   path occurs in WDM based GMPLS (Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching)
   networks that will offer fast recovery, with speeds comparable to SONET, 
   and versatile survivable functions.  
  
   Recovery techniques are broadly classified by computation timing as 
   pre-computed and dynamic and by their type of rerouting as link-based, partial 
   path-based and path-based. In dynamic techniques, a search for backup path is

   initiated upon occurrence of a failure. A backup path is computed based on 
   availability of resource at that time of failure. While dynamic techniques 
   provide better resource utilization, they suffer from long delays to search and 
   reroute the traffic on to the backup path and there is no guarantee that the 
   connection can be restored upon failure. Dynamic techniques provide a best-effort 
   type of service. In protection techniques the primary and backup routes are 
   computed and resources are reserved for backup paths before the connection is 
   established. Upon occurrence of a failure the backup path is established and 
   traffic is immediately routed on to the backup path. A pre-computed method 
   avoids long delays in setting up backup paths upon failure. The pre-computed 
   techniques also provide guarantee that a connection can be restored in the 
   event of failure. According to range of rerouting, the recovery techniques 
   are classified into link-based, segment-wised based and path-based recovery. 
   Link-based techniques reroute disrupted traffic around the failed link. This 
   approach requires the ability to identify a failed link at both ends. It also 
   makes recovery more difficult in the event of a node failure. Furthermore, it 
   limits the choice of backup path and thus may use more capacity, while path-base 
   techniques replace the whole path between the two endpoints of a demand. The 
   path-based techniques have better resource utilization while span-based 
   techniques have better recovery time. Therefore, we focus on the path-based 
   recovery, called end-to-end recovery. 


   Most backbone networks have a mesh physical topology. However, the mesh-based 
   schemes have some shortcomings. They are not as fast in failure recovery as 
   ring-based schemes and complicated working path and backup path routing 
   arrangements are used to achieve optimality, and the optimization procedures 
   used for mesh-based schemes are very computationally intensive that are virtually 
   impossible to solve for very large networks. SONET networks are, for the most 
   part, protected in the form of rings. The rings are interconnected in order to 
   provide overall network connectivity and protection. It is possible to design 
   a fast and simple recovery strategy for ring network so ring protection 
   switching is well established and robust in these days. Therefore, we need 
   the ring concept in the mesh optical network. 


   This draft describes the Ring configuration based on SRLG information and the 
   approach of using a centralized Controller that enables fast restoration in

   optical transport networks. Using the centralized Controller guarantees the 
   establishment of a disjoint end-to-end restoration path from failed working 
   paths, and helps in achieving near real-time end-to-end restoration in optical 
   transport networks.

2.1 Introduction to the centralized Controller:


    This draft addresses the coordination of the IP and optical network survivability 
    based on a consolidated network element, the controller and a truly integrated 
    control plane. This centralized Controller enables an integrated network 
    architecture where each network layer can freely exchange topology and resource 
    information. This allows network performance to be globally optimized across all 
    layers. In addition, a single control plane and the central controller that 
    manages all network layers greatly simplify network management tasks.


   
    As far as control and management types are concerned, they can be classified 
    into three categories: centralized, distributed and hybrid control/management. 
    Each control and management type has its' own advantages and disadvantages, 
    but typical telecommunication networks and automatic switched optical networks 
    (ASON) defined in ITU-T follows a centralized control/management architecture in 
    which the control plane is separate from the data plane. In this draft, for path 
    establishment and protection, we consider the control plane to be separated 
    logically from the data plane. Separate Controllers or control/management networks 
    comprising of a series of Controllers could be connected to each other by through 
    signaling channels and appropriate control message exchanges. If the domains of 
    the control/management networks increase, a hierarchical control/management 
    structure could be applied. This can be fully realized in the centralized 
    Controller through logical functional blocks. We do not restrict the 
    interconnection architecture of the optical transport networks such as overlay 
    model, peer model and augmented model. There is a channel interface between the 
    Controller and any node in the optical transport network, and this can be realized 
    using a number of methods, like Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), 
    General Switch Management Protocol (GSMP) etc. In this architecture, the 
    Controller is responsible for path calculation and recovery. Some of the recovery 
    functions are also assigned to nodes in the optical network for the purpose of 
    control and load balancing.


2.2 Network Structure:


    In this draft, we develop the network architecture with a hierarchical structure 
    following the existing network management architecture. We focus on the backbone 
    part of networks where link capacity is at least OC-48 (2.5 Gb/s). Each network node 
    is assumed to have OXC and IP router capabilities in the same hardware setup, 
    which results in the support of multiple traffic types at the same location. The 
    traffic manager in each optical network node also manages multiple traffic types. 
    Each node can communicate directly with the centralized Controller to report its 
    status. As mentioned in Section 2.1, this could be achieved via a network management 
    standard, such as SNMP or GSMP. The Controller takes care of network nodes 
    within the same administrative domain. It also has the responsibility of 
    centralizing domain network management service and integrating the management of the 
    transport network in its respective domain. This structure permits scalability, 
    as well as internetworking of different administrative domains.

2.3 Control Structure:


    Network elements within each domain communicate with one another via a common 
    control plane. We assume a dedicated out-of-band control channel between two adjacent 
    nodes, and between each node and the centralized Controller. The common control plane 
    can be implemented based on the GMPLS standard. The Resource Reservation Protocol 
    (RSVP) and Constraint-Based Routing Label Distribution Protocol (CR-LDP)
    extensions to GMPLS can provide traffic engineering in this unified network 
    architecture. Moreover, neighbor discovery and link state update can employ 
    routing protocol Link State Advertisements (LSA), such as the Intermediate System 
    to Intermediate System (IS-IS) and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) extensions to GMPLS. 


2.4 Control Plane Hierarchy Architecture for SRLG Protection and Recovery:


    In the integrated control plane proposed here, three levels of functional control 
    hierarchy are mapped into one centralized Controller node and implemented as a 
    single unit. The functional blocks involved in the controller node are: the 
    network processor (the network management system with extended functionalities), 
    the domain processor (the network element management system with extended 
    functionalities), and the node processor. In the first level, the network processor 
    acts as an interface between users and all sub-network domains. Its main 
    functionality is to oversee the provisioning of new connections across multiple 
    sub-networks and to maintain the network-wide topological view. The domain 
    processor supervises tasks within a sub-network domain, such as service 
    provisioning and network status monitoring. It handles requests for connection 
    setup and teardown, and computes explicit paths that meet the SLA of each request. 
    The network monitor observes the overall network health and detects failure and 
    repair events. The databases maintained by the domain processor include the 
    domain topology, the domain link state database gathered via the LSA protocol 
    within its domain, and the domain connection database which keeps track of all 
    established connections in the domain. The node processor manages specific 
    functionalities that can be done in a distributed manner at each node, such as 
    overload handling, failure recovery, and status monitoring. It also detects 
    sudden link overloads, conducts a countermeasure and provides rapid protection and 
    restoration capability in times of failure. The databases maintained by the node 
    processor are the local link state and the local connection databases. The local 
    link state is obtained automatically via the neighbor discovery protocol, while the 
    list of local connections is obtained from all connections that traverse the node.


    The structure of the topology database may contain the combined IP and optical 
    layer topology in a unified form. The link state database contains information 
    not only about link connectivity, but also about the shared-risk link group (SRLG)

    it belongs to, the resources available on that link, the link protection type, and 
    the link status. This extra information is defined in the LSA extensions to 
    the GMPLS. 



3.  Logical ring configuration based on SRLG


    In this part, we describe some of the logical ring configuration methods for 
    optical networks and the functions of the centralized Controller in providing 
    real-time protection and recovery. Ring-based schemes are essentially some 
    extensions of self-healing ring in the mesh topology, and the study of logical 
    ring in mesh network has been developed.   


3.1 Logical Ring with SRLG:


    Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs) allow the definition of resources or groups 
    of resources that share the same risk of failure. [6] The knowledge of SRLGs 
    may be used to compute diverse paths that can be used for protection in 
    optical networks. The concept of SRLG has been used to compute a path that is 
    disjoint from a set of links sharing the same risk. When two or more links share 
    the same risk, it may be the case that when a link fails, the others fail at the 
    same time. Proper planning needs to be done for the network to recover from 
    failures due to these risks. The risks are generally represented by SRLGs. The 
    SRLG concept generates another dimension to the existing constraint-based path 
    computation methods traditionally used in hierarchical networks 
      
    Existing logical ring architectures for recovery do not consider the SRLG 
    information for survivability of working paths and backup paths and is generally 
    configured based on topology information and network characteristics. If the link 
    from the first ingress node is broken, the network cannot provide LSP SRLG 
    disjointness. This is a rather strong bottleneck to support survivability of 
    connections with different bandwidth requirements and QoS constraints. The 
    existing logical ring configuration does not take account into the probability 
    of resource failure and risk of the link. Therefore, the disjoint path may, 
    in some cases, have some problems in being computed and hence the probability of 
    backup path failure increases though the backup path may exist. We need to 
    consider the possibility of failure of the logical ring configuration at the 
    connection setup stage.  


    We propose the network architecture as the concept of the logical ring with the 
    SRLG for reliable transmission in pre-configuration stage using the centralized 
    Controller concept. The proposed network with ring-SRLG is the set of SRLGs with 
    contribution weights per link to avoid backup path failure and guarantee the 
    survivability of traffic. The controller manages the entire domain network, as 
    discussed in Section 2.4. The description follows a logical ring configuration 
    with SRLG for the purpose of restoration in mesh networks. In this architecture, 
    backup paths can be easily established end-to-end using the logical ring 
    configuration. It guarantees the establishment of a backup path that is disjoint 
    from a primary path that is set up. The logical ring with ring-SRLG has both a 
    primary path and a backup path in same ring with one ring-SRLG. Ring-SRLG must 
    support two-way-connectivity, which supports the logical ring architecture in 
    OXC based mesh network and helps in protection and recovery using the 
    centralized Controller concept. Based on a given SRLG table, which is 
    configured at each node by the centralized Controller, one can make rings 
    between a source node and a destination node and many intermediate nodes 
    between the two.

draft-choi-pce-e2e-centralized-restoration-srlg-00.txt                July 2004




    To extend network scalability, a distributed domain management system must be used, 
    which is determined by the centralized Controller. In order to configure the 
    SRLG-based logical ring, a control unit handling algorithm may be set up in the 
    centralized Controller which then configures the SRLG-based logical ring as well 
    as GMPLS signaling for LSP setups. Our restoration signaling on the SRLG-based 
    logical ring can allow dynamic network configuration instead of static 
    configuration by operators or management systems. The use of signaling with SRLG 
    via the centralized Controller vastly reduces the complexity of network 
    configuration. 


3.2 Segment wise logical ring using the centralized Controller:


    As a network becomes large, the possibility of the size of the ring pattern 
    also became large. So, applying ring does not promote efficiency in terms of 
    end-to-end delay and recovery time. In this section we propose the method, called 
    segment-wised ring [7] that can be effectively applied to real networks without 
    those problems. Additionally, it can support fast recovery and can care for 
    partially multiple simultaneous failures. 
        
    The main concept of segment-wised ring is to partition a large network into 
    several small networks to configure ring to each small network. This is one of 
    the major functionalities of the centralized Controller, which effectively 
    partitions the addressed domain using the three functional blocks, the 
    Network Processor, Domain Processor and Node Processor. Sub-networks are 
    chosen according to network provisioning such as physical layer conditioning, 
    call demands or QoS demands, which may arise from the user. The following shows 
    segment wise logical ring architecture, with the centralized Controller managing 
    the different sub-networks:

3.3 Resource allocation with SRLG by the Controller:


    The source node can pre-compute the ring configuration based on SRLG information 
    during the primary path setup that it receives from the centralized Controller. 
    The network architecture with the concept of logical ring with SRLG for reliable 
    transmission is established via pre-configuration.  


    To discuss about the survivability of logical topology, we consider that the 
    logical topology is redundant (two-connectivity); the logical topology remains 
    connected when a physical link goes down. The ingress nodes should have the 
    SRLG history and Ring-SRLG combined with logical ring. This can be received 
    from the centralized Controller, as described in Section 2.2 and 2.4. The 
    controller can pre-compute the ring architecture before a failure based on 
    network topology information and SRLG contribution weight factors and also 
    configure the ring architecture after failure by allocating resources via 
    signaling for backup purposes. This information is also conveyed to the 
    individual ingress nodes in the domain.


 
4.  Integrated Layer Survivability and Recovery Mechanisms:


    In this section we discuss of the integrated layer protection mechanisms 
    appropriate for the central Controller.


4.1 Protection and Recovery Mechanisms: 


    A request of LSP establishment from a client network is handled by the Domain 
    Processor of the centralized Controller, as described in Section 2.4. This is 
    mapped by the Controller to the optical transport network and conveyed to the 
    corresponding nodes. When the Controller receives the request, it will try to 
    compute a logical ring encompassing the ingress and the egress node based on 
    the requested traffic parameters and the SRLG properties. There can be two 
    cases what the Controller can do, based on the number of connection setup
    requests and the number of already established connections in a domain. It can
    either distribute the LSP mapping information to the participating nodes in 
    the optical transport domain and clear the domain link state database and
    domain connection database, or provide the mapping links to the participating
    nodes. 


    i) Distribution of direct mapping information to nodes in the optical network:


    In this method, the role of Controller is to find a logical ring, to distribute 
    the mapping table and SRLG information between a primary path and a backup path 
    to the nodes in the optical network, and to trigger the establishment of a

    backup path once a failure occurs. Each node is responsible for maintaining the 
    mapping table and establishment of primary and backup path by using signaling 
    messages. When a node detects a failure, it reports the failure to its 
    corresponding domain Controller. If an end-to-end path protection is used, 
    the Controller triggers the changeover from the primary path to the backup path 
    to the ingress nodes. If the backup path is already established, the ingress 
    node simply changes the direction of the traffic flow from the primary path to 
    the backup path. However, if there is not an established backup path, the 
    ingress node tries to set up a backup path in the network when it receives 
    the trigger from the Controller. Since the ingress node has been maintaining 
    the route object for the backup path received from the Controller, the path 
    setup message from the ingress node will propagate via a route that is disjoint 
    with the primary path. 


    ii) Distribution of mapping information link to nodes in the optical network:


    In this method, the nodes in the optical transport network performs failure 
    detection and switching operation based on the pointers provided by the forwarding
    table given by the corresponding domain processor. The Controller performs the 
    roles of finding a logical ring as well as signaling to establish a primary and 
    backup path. When a failure is reported from a node in the optical network to the 
    corresponding Controller, the Controller should look up its' internal table in 
    the domain link state and domain connection databases that maintains the backup 
    path mapped to the failed primary path. By using the Backup Route Object [7], 
    the Controller tries to establish the backup path. Once it is done, the setup 
    message of the backup path will be sent from the Controller managing the ingress 
    node domain to the Controller managing the egress node domain. When the backup 
    path is established through the logical ring configuration, each Controller on 
    the path should send the forwarding table to the corresponding node to configure 
    its' forwarding databases. GSMP could be adapted for this purpose and suitable 
    extensions proposed. 


4.2 Protocol based Ring Recovery Mechanisms using the Controller: 


    ITU-T G.otnpro.2 [9] provides protection switching by using logical ring 
    concept. However, it does not take account into the probability of resource 
    failure and risk of the link according to a lack of true diverse fiber routes. 
    We may need to consider the possibility of failure of the logical ring 
    configuration at the connection setup stage.

    The APS protocol (ITU-T G.otnpro.2) can be used between the Controller and the 
    optical network nodes in the ring topology. It is ideal to overcome the 
    bottleneck of the usual 50 ms communications delay between Controller and nodes 
    in the optical transport network. 



5.  Signaling and Integrated Service Provisioning: 


    A robust and efficient signaling protocol should be used to distribute the 
    mapping table from the Controller to the nodes in the optical transport network
    and for informing a failure from a node to the corresponding Controller. 
    Signaling for restoration is also needed along the primary path and the backup 
    path at the time of connection setup. GMPLS mechanisms are similar to those used 
    for setting up primary paths and backup paths. In order to support our mechanism, 
    GSMP or APS may be extended or a totally new protocol could be proposed. 


6.  Conclusion


    Network survivability is a critical requirement in high-speed networks. So, 
    recovery mechanisms that can provide fast recovery and efficient capacity are 
    needed. Our proposed network architecture using the centralized Controller 
    considered high survivability of backup path, called ring-SRLG that has grouped 
    traffic driven logical rings and shared resources in GMPLS based networks. 
    Ring-SRLG with the centralized Controller can guarantee the survivability 
    of backup paths with constraints to the other logical ring configuration. Our 
    proposed backup paths can be easily established through the end-to-end path, 
    which follows the logical ring configuration. It guarantees the establishment 
    of backup path disjoint from the working path. 


    We have shown that our proposed integrated provisioning, which combines 
    protection efforts from both IP and optical layers, is favorable over the 
    traditional provisioning approach. The integrated protection effort achieves 
    efficient resource allocation in terms of total bandwidth reservation, 
    bandwidth utilization, and connection blocking probability. The level of 
    improvement largely depends on the type of pre-configured underlying lightpath 
    protection. While we expect that the choice of lightpath protection should 
    depend on the nature of service requests, we leave it up to the service 
    provider to make this choice. The scheme takes advantage of information 
    sharing across network layers which is facilitated by GMPLS. The proposed 
    scheme uses GMPLS capabilities to provide end-to-end survivability against 
    network failures. This integrated provisioning scheme can deliver rapid 
    service provisioning dynamically on demand. The consolidated effort simplifies 
    the provisioning process and reduces network management complexity by 
    eliminating the cumbersome coordination of provisioning in separate network 
    layers.
