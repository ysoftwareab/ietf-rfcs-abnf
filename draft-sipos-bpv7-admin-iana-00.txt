                     draft-sipos-bpv7-admin-iana-00

Abstract

   This document clarifies that a Bundle Protocol Version 7 agent is
   intended to use an IANA sub-registry for Administrative Record types.
   It also makes a code point reservation for private or experimental
   use.

1.  Introduction

   The earlier Bundle Protocol (BP) Version 6 (BPv6) defined an IANA
   sub-registry for Administrative Record type code points under
   [IANA-BP].  When Bundle Protocol Version 7 (BPv7) was published in
   [I-D.ietf-dtn-bpbis] it included an explicit table of Administrative
   Record types but made no mention of an IANA registry nor a
   requirement for BPv7 agents to be extensible in how they handle
   Administrative Record types.  The BPv7 specification also did not
   discriminate between code point reservations and unassigned ranges
   for Administrative Record types.

   This document updates BPv7 to explicitly use the IANA Administrative
   Record type registry in Section 2.  This document also makes a
   reservation of high-valued code points for private or experimental
   use to avoid collisions with assigned code points.

1.1.  Scope

   This document describes updates to the IANA Administrative Record
   type sub-registry and how a BPv7 agent is supposed to use that
   registry for identifying Administrative Record types.

   This document does not specify how BPv6 and BPv7 can interoperate for
   overlapping code points or how a specific code point is to be
   interpreted either similarly or differently between Bundle Protocol
   versions.  It is up to each individual Administrative Record type
   specification to define how it relates to each BP version.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Administrative Record Types Registry

   This document updates the requirements in Section 6.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-dtn-bpbis] to use an existing IANA registry and updates
   that sub-registry in Section 4.1.

   Instead of using the explicit list of types in Table 3 of
   [I-D.ietf-dtn-bpbis], a BPv7 Agent SHALL interpret Administrative
   Record type code values in accordance with the IANA "Bundle
   Administrative Record Types" sub-registry under [IANA-BP] for entries
   having a "Bundle Protocol Version" of 7.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document does not define any requirements or structures which
   introduce new security considerations.

   The existing security considerations of [I-D.ietf-dtn-bpbis] still
   apply when using the IANA Administrative Record Types sub-registry.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This specification modifies a BPv6 sub-registry to extend BPv7.

4.1.  Bundle Administrative Record Types

   Within the "Bundle Protocol" registry [IANA-BP], the "Bundle
   Administrative Record Types" sub-registry has been updated to include
   a leftmost "Bundle Protocol Version" column.  The existing sub-
   registry entries have been updated to have BP versions as in the
   following table.
