 Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) for Segment Routing Policies
                        for Traffic Engineering
                   draft-ali-spring-bfd-sr-policy-01

Abstract

   Segment Routing (SR) allows a headend node to steer a packet flow
   along any path using a segment list which is referred to as a SR
   Policy.  Intermediate per-flow states are eliminated thanks to source
   routing.  The header of a packet steered in an SR Policy is augmented
   with the ordered list of segments associated with that SR Policy.
   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is used to monitor different
   kinds of paths between node.  BFD mechanisms can be also used to
   monitor the availability of the path indicated by a SR Policy and to
   detect any failures.  Seamless BFD (SBFD) extensions provide a
   simplified mechanism which is suitable for monitoring of paths that
   are setup dynamically and on a large scale.

   This document describes the use of Seamless BFD (SBFD) mechanism to
   monitor the SR Policies that are used for Traffic Engineering (TE) in
   SR deployments.

1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) ([RFC8402]) allows a headend node to steer a
   packet flow along any path for specific objectives like Traffic
   Engineering (TE) and to provide it treatment according to the
   specific established service level agreement (SLA) for it.
   Intermediate per-flow states are eliminated thanks to source routing.
   The headend node steers a flow into an SR Policy.  The header of a
   packet steered in an SR Policy is augmented with the ordered list of
   segments associated with that SR Policy.  SR Policy
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] specifies the concepts of SR
   Policy and steering into an SR Policy.

   SR Policy state is instantiated only on the head-end node and any
   intermediate node or the endpoint node does not require any state to
   be maintained or instantiated for it.  SR Policies are not signaled
   through the network nodes except the signaling required to
   instantiate them on the head-end in the case of a controller based
   deployment.  This enables SR Policies to scale far better than
   previous TE mechanisms.  This also enables SR Policies to be
   instantiated dynamically and on demand basis for steering specific
   traffic flows corresponding to service routes as they are signaled.
   These automatic steering and signaling mechanisms for SR Policies are
   described in SR Policy [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].

   There is a requirement to continuously monitor the availability of
   the path corresponding to the SR Policy along the nodes in the
   network and to signal any failures detected to the head-end node so
   that it could take corrective action to restore service.  The
   corrective actions may be either to invalidate the candidate path
   that has experienced failure and to switch to another candidate path
   within the same SR Policy OR to activate another backup SR Policy or
   candidate path for end-to-end path protection.  These mechanisms are
   beyond the scope of this document.

   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) mechanisms have been
   specified for use for monitoring of unidirectional MPLS LSPs via BFD
   MPLS [RFC5884].  Seamless BFD [RFC7880] defines a simplified
   mechanism for using BFD with a large proportion of negotiation
   aspects eliminated, thus providing benefits such as quick
   provisioning, as well as improved control and flexibility for network
   nodes initiating path monitoring.  When BFD or SBFD is used for
   verification of such unidirectional LSP paths, the reverse path is
   via the shortest path from the tail-end router back to the head-end
   router as determined by routing.

   The SR Policy is essentially a unidirectional path through the
   network.  This document describes the use of BFD and more
   specifically SBFD for monitoring of SR Policy paths through the
   network.  SR can be instantiated using both MPLS and IPv6 dataplanes.
   The mechanism described in this document applies to both these
   instantiations of SR Policy.

2.  Choice of SBFD over BFD

   BFD MPLS [RFC5884] describes a mechanism where LSP Ping [RFC8029] is
   used to bootstrap the BFD session over an MPLS TE LSP path.  The LSP
   Ping mechanism was extended to support SR LSPs via SR LSP Ping
   [RFC8287] and a similar mechanism could have been considered for BFD
   monitoring of SR Policies on MPLS data-plane.  However, this document

Internet-Draft         BFD for SR Policies for TE           October 2018


   proposes instead to use SBFD mechanism as it is more suitable for SR
   Policies.

   Some of the key aspects of SR Policies that are considered in
   arriving at this decision are as follows:

   o  SR Policies do not require any signaling to be performed through
      the network nodes in order to be setup.  They are simply
      instantiated on the head-end node via provisioning or even
      dynamically by a controller via BGP SR-TE
      [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy] or using PCEP (PCEP SR
      [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing], PCE Initiated [RFC8281], PCEP
      Stateful [RFC8231]).

   o  SR Policies result in state being instantiated only on the head-
      end node and no other node in the network.

   o  In many deployments, SR Policies are instantiated dynamically and
      on-demand or in the case of automated steering for BGP routes,
      when routes are learnt with specific color communities (refer SR
      Policy [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] for details).

   o  SR Policies are expected to be deployed in much higher scale.

   o  SR Policies can be instantiated both for MPLS and IPv6 data-planes
      and hence a monitoring mechanism which works for both is
      desirable.

   In view of the above, the BFD mechanism to be used for monitoring
   them needs to be simple, lightweight, one that does not result in
   instantiation of per SR Policy state anywhere but the head-end and
   which can be setup and deleted dynamically, on-demand and at scale.
   The SFBD extensions provide this support as described in Seamless BFD
   [RFC7880].  Furthermore, SBFD Use-Cases [RFC7882] clarifies the
   applicability in the Centralized TE and SR scenarios.

3.  Procedures

   The general procedures and mechanisms for SBFD operations are
   specified in Seamless BFD [RFC7880].  This section describes the
   specifics related to SBFD use for SR Policies.

   SR Policies are represented on a head-end router as <color,endpoint
   IP address> tuple.  The SRTE process on the head-end determines the
   tail-end node of a SR Policy on the basis of the endpoint IP address.
   In the cases where the SR Policy endpoint is outside the domain of
   the head-end node, this information is available with the centralized

   controller that computed the multi-domain SR Policy path for the
   head-end.

   In order to enable SBFD monitoring for a given SR Policy, the SBFD
   Discriminator for the tail-end node (i.e. one with the endpoint IP
   address) which is going to be the SBFD Reflector is required.  ISIS
   SBFD [RFC7883] and OSPF SBFD [RFC7884] describe the extensions to the
   ISIS and OSPF link state routing protocols that allow all nodes to
   advertise their SBFD Discriminators across the network.  BGP-LS SBFD
   [I-D.li-idr-bgp-ls-sbfd-extensions] describes extensions for
   advertising the SBFD discriminators via BGP-LS across domains and to
   a controller.  Thus, either the SRTE head-end node or the controller,
   as the case may be, have the SBFD Discriminator of the tail-end node
   of the SR Policy available.

   The SRTE Process can straightaway instantiate the SBFD mechanism on
   the SR Policy as soon as it is provisioned in the forwarding to start
   verification of the path to the endpoint.  No signaling or
   provisioning is required for the tail-end node on a per SR Policy
   basis and it just performs its role as a stateless SBFD Reflector.
   The return path used by SBFD is via the normal IP routing back to the
   head-end node.  Once the specific SR Policy path is verified via
   SBFD, then it is considered as active and may be used for traffic
   steering.

   The SBFD monitoring continues for the SR Policy and any failure is
   notified to the SRTE process.  In response to the failure of a
   specific candidate path, the SRTE process may trigger any of the
   following based on local policy or implementation specific aspects
   which are outside the scope of this document:

   o  Trigger path-protection for the SR Policy

   o  Declare the specific candidate path as invalid and switch to using
      the next valid candidate path based on preference

   o  If no alternate candidate path is available, then handle the
      steering over that SR Policy based on its invalidation policy
      (e.g.  drop or switch to best effort routing).

4.  IANA Considerations
