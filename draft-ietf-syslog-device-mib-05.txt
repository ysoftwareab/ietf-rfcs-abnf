Abstract

   This memo provides a MIB module that can be used to monitor and manage
   syslog processes. It defines objects that allow the collection of
   information related to syslog processes, it also defines objects that
   can be used to monitor and/or control syslog processes.

Internet Draft                                         February 16, 2004


1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, this document describes managed objects used for
   configuring and monitoring syslog processes that handle syslog
   messages.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

2. Background

   Operating systems, processes and applications generate messages
   indicating their own status or the occurance of events. These
   messages are useful for managing and/or debugging the network and its
   services. The BSD Syslog protocol is a widely adopted protocol that
   is used for transmission and processing of the messages.
   Essentially, a syslog process receives messages (from the kernel,
   processes, applications or other syslog processes) and processes
   those. The processing involves logging to a local file, displaying on
   console, user terminal, and/or relaying to syslog processes on other
   machines. The processing is determined by the "facility" that
   originated the message and the "severity" assigned to the message by
   the facility.

   This document defines a generic MIB that may be used to monitor and
   control one or more syslog processes running on a system.

   The syslogMIB will be used in conjunction with other MIBs - in
   particular the Host Resources MIB and the script MIB. The generic
   process related matters e.g. process control, status, resource usage

   etc. will be serviced by the corresponding entries in the Host
   Resources MIB. The configuration of the syslog process is not
   directly supported. The configuration process can be serviced by an
   implementation of a script MIB in which the configuration file is
   treated as the script which is interpreted by the syslog process,


                                    /
                          +------+ /
                          | SP-1 |------> SP-R1

                          +------+ \
                                    \

             Facility: Facility originating the message (locally)
           SyslogHost: Remote SyslogHost relaying a message
                   SP: Syslog Process


                   Fig.1 Syslog Process Model

   The syslog process modelled by the MIB is shown in Fig.1. One or more
   syslog processes running on a system receive syslog messages from the
   local facilities and from other syslog processes on other hosts. The
   syslog process receives the message and processes it depending on the
   processing mandated for the facility and severity of the message in
   its local message-process configuration table.


3. The MIB Design.

   The purpose of the SyslogMIB is to allow the monitoring and control
   of the syslog process(es) on a system. This requires MOs representing

   o  Statistics on messages, received, processed locally, relayed,
   o  Syslog system wide parameters that are available to all syslog
      processes.
   o  Syslog run time parameters for each syslog process e.g.
            - maximum message size,
            - sockets and/or type of transport, port numbers on which
              the process will listen for messages, etc.

            - etc.

   The MIB comprises of four groups
   o  The syslogSystem group handles the system wide parameters
      that applies to all the syslog processes served by the
      SNMP agent.
   o  The syslog process group consisting of the
      - syslogStatsTable which deals with statistical information about
        the syslog processes.
      - syslogParamsTable for monitoring and controlling syslog
        processes. It contains MOs representing the run-time parameters
        of the syslog processes.
   o  The conformance group that defines the compliance statements.

7.  Security Considerations


   Syslog plays a very important role in the computer and network
   security of an organization. SyslogMIB defines several managed
   objects that may be used to monitor configure and control syslog
   processes. As such improper manipulation of the objects represented
   by this MIB may lead to an attack on an important component of the
   computer and network security infrastructure.  The objects in
   syslogParamsTable, syslogAllowedHostsTable, syslogCtlSelectionTable,
   syslogCtlLogActionTable, syslogCtlUserActionTable
   syslogCtlFwdActionTable, syslogCtlPipeActionTable  may be
   misconfigured to cause syslog messages to be diverted or lost. A
   misconfiguration may also result in a DoS attack on a user or
   service.  There are a number of management objects defined in this
   MIB module with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
   Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
   network environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their

Internet Draft                                         February 16, 2004


   sensitivity/vulnerability:

       o  syslogParamsTable: the objects in this table describe the
          configuration of the syslog processes.
       o  syslogAllowedHostsTable: the objects in this table describe the hosts
          from which syslog messages will be accepted. Improper configuration may
          lead to loss of messages from an important source or a flood of messages
          from a, potentially rogue, source.


   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

       o  syslogProcTable: objects in this table carry sensitive information.  The
          counters may reveal information about the deployment and effectiveness
          of the relevant security systems. The counters may be analyzed to tell
          whether the security systems are able to detect an event or not.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
