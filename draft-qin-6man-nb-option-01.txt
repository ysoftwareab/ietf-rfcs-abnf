1.  Introduction

   This document describes an IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) option
   (called BFURL option) that can be used to provide configuration
   information for nodes to be booted from network instead of local
   media.

   IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) [RFC4862] and IPv6
   Neighbor Discovery (ND) [RFC4861] define ways to configure IPv6
   addresses, on-link prefix list, default routers and other parameters.

   The existing ND message (RA) is used to carry this network boot
   information.  Nodes can get the boot file url and parameters through
   RA messages via BFRUL option.  A boot file can be a boot-loader
   program or a minimal OS kernel.  The node firmware needs to download
   the boot file and execute it.

   This approach is useful in networks with no DHCPv6 infrastructure.
   The intention is to simplify the implementation of first-stage
   communicating functionalities of the nodes (i.e.  PXE firmware), and
   network.  The distribution of additional information and subsequent
   communications between the node and network side (e.g., an install
   server) should be handled by applications built in the boot file.

   The configuration of a Boot-File-URL would be required into routers
   sending RA messages.  The configuration mechanism ( manual or
   automatic) is out of scope of this document.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Option

   The option formats comply with ND options per [RFC4861]
   (Section 4.6).

2.1.  Boot File Uniform Resource Locator (URL) Option

   Routers send this option to nodes with a URL to a boot file.

   Fields description:

   Type                    TBD.

   Length                  The length of this option (including the Type
                           and Length fields) in units of 8 octets.

   Boot-File-URL           The URL for a boot file in string.  Its
                           format Must comply with [RFC3986].

3.  Implementation Considerations

   In the current format of BFURL option (Section 2.1), there is no
   field defined to identify the architectures of nodes to be booted
   from network.  Implementers should be aware of the details of their
   deployment environment and tailor the boot file to accommodate the
   network booting nodes of different types.

   A new IPv6 Router Solicitation (RS) option can be defined in the
   future for nodes to send the information of architecture types they
   support to the network side for the selection of appropriate boot
   file.

   Also, there is no field defined in the BFURL option nor any
   individual option specified in this document for the network booting
   parameters.  We recommend that, the basic parameters required should
   be embedded in the boot file itself.  That can ease the configuration

   of network booting functionality on the network devices.  After the
   boot file or the built-in application is successfully executed, they
   should take the responsibility of guiding the subsequent phases of
   installation.

   This document puts no constraints on the protocols used to download
   the boot file.  While it is possible that the downloading protocol is
   specified in the URL by syntax.

   Domain names may be used in the boot file URL rather than an IPv6
   address.  That requires the network booting nodes to support DNS
   implementation.  The DNS server information can be also distributed
   by RA options per [RFC8106].

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires a new ND option type to be allocated.

   Option Name                     Type

   Boot-File-URL                   TBD.

5.  Security Considerations

   Rogue RA messages with wrong URL information may be received in the
   untrusted environment and direct the network booting nodes to
   download boot file from an attacker's file server.  The Secure
   Neighbor Discovery (SEND) protocol [RFC3791] is designed to allow all
   ND options including the BFURL option specified in this document to
   be sent with digital signature, which prevent this kind of attack.

   To pretect the boot file downloading process, using protocols like
   HTTPS is recommended.  Further, security mechanisms can be
   implemented within the built-in application or the boot file to be
   executed, to secure the communications in the later stage.
