Internet-Draft          ECC Algorithms for MIKEY               June 2007


1.  Introduction

   This document describes additional algorithms for use in MIKEY.  The
   document assumes that the reader is familiar with the MIKEY protocol.

   The MIKEY protocol [RFC3830] defines three methods for transporting
   or establishing keys: with the use of a pre-shared key, public-key
   encryption (MIKEY-RSA), and Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange (MIKEY-
   DHSIGN).  This document extends MIKEY-DHSIGN to use Elliptic Curve
   Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) or Elliptic Curve German Digital
   Signature Algorithm (ECGDSA) as the signature algorithm and further
   extends MIKEY-DHSIGN to use Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)
   groups.  In addition, this document introduces two new methods based
   on the the Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES) and
   Elliptic Curve Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (ECMQV).  The ECIES method (MIKEY-
   ECIES) is similar to MIKEY-RSA method, and the ECMQV method (MIKEY-
   ECMQV) is similar to MIKEY-DHSIGN method.

   Implementations have shown that elliptic curve algorithms can
   significantly improve performance and security-per-bit over other
   recommended algorithms.  The purpose of this document is to expand
   the options available to implementers of MIKEY to take advantage of
   these benefits.

   In addition, elliptic curve algorithms are capable of providing
   security consistent with AES keys of 128, 192, and 256 bits without
   extensive growth in asymmetric key sizes.  The following table, taken
   from [HOF] and [LEN], gives approximate comparable key sizes for
   symmetric systems, ECC systems, and DH/DSA/RSA systems.  The
   estimates are based on the running times of the best algorithms known
   today.

                 Symmetric  |  ECC2N  |  ECP  |  DH/DSA/RSA
                     80     |   163   |  192  |     1024
                    128     |   283   |  256  |     3072
                    192     |   409   |  384  |     7680
                    256     |   571   |  521  |    15360

                       Table 1: Comparable key sizes

   Thus, for example, when securing a 192-bit symmetric key, it is
   prudent to use either 409-bit ECC2N, 384-bit ECP, or 7680-bit DH/DSA/
   RSA.  With smaller key sizes the symmetric keys would be
   underprotected.

   Section 2 describes the extension of MIKEY-DHSIGN to use the ECDSA or
   ECGDSA signature algorithm.  Section 3 describes the extension of
   MIKEY-DHSIGN to use ECDH groups.  Section 4 describes the MIKEY-ECIES

   describes additional payloads required to support these new methods.

2.  MIKEY-DHSIGN with ECDSA or ECGDSA

   MIKEY-DHSIGN is described in Section 3.3 of [RFC3830].  The
   Initiator's message includes SIGNi, a signature covering the
   Initiator's message.  As well, the Responder's message includes
   SIGNr, a signature covering the Responder's message.  According to
   Section 4.2.6 of [RFC3830], the signature algorithm applied is
   defined by, and dependent on the certificate used.  It is MANDATORY
   to support RSA PKCS#1, v1.5, and it is RECOMMENDED to support RSA
   PSS.  Instead of these signature algorithms, ECDSA or ECGDSA may be
   used to allow shorter and more efficient signatures.

   ECDSA signatures are detailed in [ANSI-X9.62] and ECGDSA signatures
   are detailed in [ISO-IEC-15946-2].  Curve selection and other
   parameters will be defined by, and dependent on the certificate used.
   When generating signatures, the hash function that MUST be used
   depends on the key size, as follows:

                       ECC2N  |  ECP  |  Hash To Use
                        163   |  192  |  SHA-1
                        233   |  224  |  SHA-224
                        283   |  256  |  SHA-256
                        409   |  384  |  SHA-384
                        571   |  521  |  SHA-512

                Table 2: Hash to use with ECDSA and ECGDSA

   The signature payload (SIGN) specified in Section 6.5 of [RFC3830]
   can be used without modification.  Two additional S types for ECDSA
   and ECGDSA are defined as follows:

         S type        | Value | Comments
         -------------------------------------
         ECDSA         |     2 | ECDSA signature [ANSI_X9.62]
         ECGDSA        |     3 | ECGDSA signature [ISO/IEC_15946-2]

   [RFC3279] describes algorithms and identifiers for Internet X.509
   certificates and CRLs.  It includes ECC algorithms and identifiers.

   To use the ECDSA or ECGDSA signature algorithm with Elliptic Curve
   Diffie-Hellman, this extension to MIKEY-DHSIGN may be combined with
   the extension described in Section 3.

3.  MIKEY-DHSIGN with ECDH

   MIKEY-DHSIGN is described in Section 3.3 of [RFC3830].  According to
   Section 4.2.7 of [RFC3830], the support for OAKLEY 5 is MANDATORY and
   support for OAKLEY 1 and OAKLEY 2 are OPTIONAL.  Instead of these
   Diffie-Hellman (DH) groups, elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)
   groups may significantly improve performance and security.

   The ECDH groups to be used by MIKEY are the groups recommended by
   NIST in FIPS 186-2 [FIPS-186-2].  Detailed descriptions of the ECDH
   groups can be found in each of FIPS 186-2 [FIPS-186-2] and SEC 2
   [SEC2].  The ECDH groups use elliptic curves over GF[2^N] with N
   prime or over GF[P] with P prime.  Eleven of the groups proposed here
   have been assigned identifiers by IANA [IANA] and the remaining five
   might later be assigned identifiers by IANA.  The group with IANA
   number 6 is described in [ANSI-X9.62] and [SEC2], with object
   identifier sect163r1, but it is not one of the fifteen curves that
   NIST recommends [FIPS-186-2].  The remaining NIST recommended groups
   are suggested and anticipated to be assigned IANA numbers as
   specified in Table 3.

   The ECDH groups in Table 3 are arranged into 5 classes, corresponding

   to approximately equivalent security strengths.  To encourage
   interoperability, implementations that support one of these classes,
   SHOULD support the one group in that class that is defined over a
   prime field (which will be one of P-192, P-224, P-256, P-384, or
   P-521).  Implementations SHOULD support one of P-256 or P-384.
   Implementations MAY support any set of groups.

   The DH data payload (DH) specified in Section 6.4 of [RFC3830] can be
   used without modification.  Additional DH-Group identifiers are
   required as follows:

               DH-Group                              | Value
               --------------------------------------|-------

   When using the ECDH groups, the DH-value in the DH data payload (DH)
   is the octet string representation specified in ANSI X9.62
   [ANSI-X9.62] and [SEC1].

   If the initiator chooses secret i and the responder chooses secret r,
   then the raw shared secret is the x-coordinate(only) of (ir)*G.

   To use ECDH and ECDSA signature algorithm or to use ECDH and ECGDSA
   signature algorithm, this extension to MIKEY-DHSIGN may be combined
   with the extension described in Section 2.

4.  MIKEY-ECIES

   The Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES) is a public-
   key encryption scheme based on ECC.  Section 3.2 of [RFC3830] already
   specifies a public-key encryption method (MIKEY-RSA).  Here we
   describe the new MIKEY-ECIES method.

      Initiator                                       Responder

      I_MESSAGE =
      HDR, T, RAND, [IDi|CERTi], [IDr], {SP},
          KEMAC, [CHASH], PKE, SIGNi          --->

                                                      R_MESSAGE =
                                             [<---]   HDR, T, [IDr], V

   As with the MIKEY-RSA case, the main objective of the Initiator's
   message is to transport one or more TGKs and a set of security
   parameters to the Responder in a secure manner.  In general, the
   MIKEY-ECIES and MIKEY-RSA methods are exactly the same, except that
   the supported signature algorithm and the public key encryption
   algorithm are different.

   The signature algorithm applied is defined by, and dependent on the
   certificate used.  The MIKEY-ECIES method supports ECDSA as described
   in [ANSI-X9.62] and ECGDSA as described in [ISO-IEC-15946-2].  The
   SIGNi will use either ECDSA or ECGDSA as a signature algorithm, as
   described in Section 2.

   The public key encryption algorithm applied is defined by, and
   dependent on the certificate used.  The MIKEY-ECIES method supports
   ECIES as described in detail in [SEC1].  For ECIES, the key
   derivation function that MUST be used is ANSI-X9.63-KDF as described
   in [SEC1].  As well, the MAC scheme that MUST be used is HMAC-SHA-1-
   160.  The 'standard' elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman primitive MUST be
   used (as opposed to 'cofactor').  The symmetric encryption scheme
   that MUST be used depends on the key size, as follows:

                 ECC2N  |  ECP  |  Symmetric Cipher To Use
                  163   |  192  |       3DES-CBC
                  233   |  224  |       AES-128-CBC
                  283   |  256  |       AES-128-CBC
                  409   |  384  |       AES-256-CBC
                  571   |  521  |       AES-256-CBC

5.  MIKEY-ECMQV

   ECMQV (Elliptic Curve Menezes-Qu-Vanstone) is defined in ANSI X9.63
   [ANSI-X9.63].  ECMQV provides mutual authentication between the
   communicating parties and key establishment for the secure transport
   of data.  Here we describe the new MIKEY-ECMQV method based on the
   2-pass protocol.

   Initiator                                      Responder

   I_MESSAGE =
   HDR, T, RAND, [IDi|CERTi], [IDr],
        {SP}, ECCPTi, SIGNi                --->

                                                  R_MESSAGE =
                                          [<---]  HDR, T, [IDr|CERTr],
                                                  IDi, ECCPTr, ECCPTi, V

   The MIKEY-ECMQV method is similar to the MIKEY-DHSIGN method, except
   that with MIKEY-ECMQV, a variable-length shared secret is created
   using ECMQV instead of a fixed-length shared secret.  Same as the
   MIKEY-DHSIGN method, this method cannot be used to create group keys;
   it can only be used to create single peer-to-peer keys.

   The MIKEY-ECMQV method create a variable-length shared secret.  From
   this shared secret, the TGK and the auth_key for the Responder's
   verification message are derived.  The first portion of the shared
   secret is the TGK, and the second portion of the shared secret is the
   auth_key.  The length of TGK is specified in ECCPT payload by the
   Initiator.  The length of auth_key is derived from the authentication
   algorithm, which is also specified in ECCPT payload by the Initiator.

   The main objective of the Initiator's message is to provide the
   Responder with its ephemeral public key represented by the elliptic
   curve point (ECCPTi), and a set of security protocol parameters.
   These parameters include the authentication algorithm for the
   Responder's verification message, the length of TGK, and the key
   validity information.

   The SIGNi is a signature covering the Initiator's message using the
   Initiator's signature key from the Initiator's certificate.  The
   signature algorithm applied is defined by, and dependent on the
   certificate used.  The MIKEY-ECMQV method supports ECDSA as described
   in [ANSI-X9.62] and ECGDSA as described in [ISO-IEC-15946-2].  The
   SIGNi will use either ECDSA or ECGDSA as a signature algorithm, as
   described in Section 2.

   Initiator with its ephemeral public key represented by the elliptic
   curve point (ECCPTr).  The set of security protocol parameters are
   the same as the one in the Initiator's message.

   If the Initiator's message is authenticated and accepted by the
   Responder, and the ECMQV shared secret is created successfully, then
   the verification message (V) is created using the auth_key.  V is
   calculated in the same way as in the MIKEY-PSA method (see Section
   5.2 of [RFC3830]).

   If the Responder does not support the set of parameters suggested by
   the Initiator, the error message SHOULD include the supported
   parameters (see Section 5.1.1 of [ANSI-X9.63]).

   The error message is formed as:

   HDR, T, {ERR}, {SP}, [SIGNr]

   In case of error, the ECMQV shared secret should not be computed.
   Without the shared secret, V cannot be generated.  As a result, the
   error message should include a SIGNr instead of V, in the cases when
   the Responder is able to authenticate the Initiator's message.

   The SIGNr is a signature covering the Responder's error message using
   the Responder's signature key from the Responder's certificate.  The
   signature algorithm applied is defined by, and dependent on the
   certificate used.  The MIKEY-ECMQV method support ECDSA as described
   in [ANSI-X9.62] and ECGDSA as described in [ISO-IEC-15946-2].  The
   SIGNi will use either ECDSA or ECGDSA as a signature algorithm, as
   described in Section 2.

   2-pass ECMQV is described in detail in ANSI X9.63 [ANSI-X9.63].

     values.

   * TGK len (16 bits): the length of the TGK (in bytes).

   * KV (4 bits): indicates the type of key validity period specified.
     This may be done by using an SPI (alternatively an MKI in SRTP) or
     by providing an interval in which the key is valid (e.g., in the
     latter case, for SRTP this will be the index range where the key
     is valid).  See Section 6.13 of [RFC3830] for pre-defined values.

   * KV data (variable length): This includes either the SPI/MKI or an
     interval (see Section 6.14 of [RFC3830]).  If KV is NULL, this
     field is not included.

7.  Security Considerations

   Since this document proposes new methods for use within MIKEY, many
   of the security considerations contained within [RFC3830] apply here
   as well.  Some of the methods proposed in this document offer higher
   cryptographic strength than those proposed in [RFC3830].  In
   particular, there are elliptic curves corresponding to each of the
   symmetric key sizes 80 bits, 128 bits, 192 bits, and 256 bits.  This
   allows the MIKEY key exchange to offer security comparable with
   higher-strength AES algorithms and SHA implementations.  The methods
   proposed in this document are among those standardized by NIST in
   FIPS 186-2 [FIPS-186-2], by the SECG in SEC2 [SEC2], and by ANSI in
   ANSI X9.62 [ANSI-X9.62] and X9.63 [ANSI-X9.63].

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document adds entries to existing MIKEY namespaces in Section 2
   (S types in signature payloads), Section 3 (DH Group identifier in DH
   payloads), Section 6.1 (ECCPT payload identifier), and Section 6.1
   (ECC curve).
