1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Protocol overview

   This is a simple protocol to periodically send and receive UDP
   multicast PDU that contains bgp transport information in the form of
   messages and TLVs.  Receiver could use this information to bootstrap
   the single hop bgp and/or loopback address bgp between directly
   connected bgp speakers.  The advertised information gets expired if
   it is not refreshed before the lifetime ends.

   This protocol does not provide any reliability of delivery and relies
   on UDP multicast and periodic send.  The current version of this
   protocol assumes the link MTU is good enough to encode BGP transport
   information or underlying IP implementation is able to fragment and
   reassemble for link local multicast PDU.  But this protocol is
   flexible enough to implement a future version of fragment TLV
   attachment.  This is to bypass smaller link MTU for a system or
   environment preventing IP fragment.

   Service Advertisement (SA) PDU has multiple types of messages.  This
   document defines 2 types of messages.  The primary/base messages are
   required for SA to operate and secondary type messages for BGP
   service advertisement.

3.  PUD layers

   The PDU contains a header followed by variable number of messages.
   Each message contains variable number of TLVs.

   SA uses type-length-value format.

   loopback addresses with link address.

   Type : 22

   Length: 4 for IPv4 address and 16 for IPv6 address 6 for mac address.

   Value:interface IPv4 or IPv6 or mac address .

5.  Protocol operation

   A sender should periodically send PDU to refresh the advertised
   information before its lifetime expires.  An implementation may send
   PDU well before the lifetime expires based on specific events.  These
   events could be a local config change or discovering a new
   advertiser.  Also, implementation could switch to fast refresh when
   content of the pdu changes and move back to regular refresh interval.
   The fast refresh will help in quicker discovery and may help update
   content in case of auto order delivery.  As stated above, this is
   purely an implementation technique than the protocol mandate.

   To discover multi-data(IPv4/IPv6) protocol environment(mixed
   transport mode in a single link) sender shall send both data-protocol
   pdu based on local configuration.  When sender choose to send both
   data protocol PDU it should make sure that semantic content of the
   messages should be same.  An implementation may choose to use
   preferred data protocol PDU as primary send PDU and only send other
   data protocol PDU during the interesting events.  This optimization
   is only possible when all the known advertisers participates in both
   data-protocol.

   A sender should send PDU to refresh before previously advertised
   lifetime expires.  If bgp is configured with only one transport
   address family(IPv4/v6) then sender shall only send corresponding
   data protocol PDU.  If both addresses are configured, then it shall
   use both data protocol PDUs.  PDUs are sent with source address as
   link primary address and destination is link local all- routers with
   TTL 255.  If authentication is enabled then add authentication TLV
   using the authentication procedure described in authentication
   section.  Populate other TLVs based on local preference and send the
   PDU on configured link.  Semantic content (transport and session
   information) of the PDU should be same irrespective of data protocol.

   Receiver resets the state when it accepts new PDU irrespective of the
   data protocol.  Receiver shall add a route for the address in local
   address TLV with nexthop as source address of the PDU if PDU(PUD)
   data protocol and local address is same address family.  Otherwise if
   link address is available, it could be used as nexthop for the
   address in local address TLV.  Receivers consolidate state from
   various TLVs and pass it on to BGP for the session opening.  An
   implementation could only notify if the state change from previous
   reported state to bgp or the configuration sequence number changes
   from the receiver.  How bgp uses this information is beyond the scope
   of the document.

5.1.  Transmit procedure

   PDUs are sent with source address as link's primary address and
   destination is link local all-routers with TTL 255.  PDU is sent to
   SA UDP port(179 if assigned).  After the header, SA Base message
   should be first message.  If authentication is enabled then add
   authentication TLV using the authentication procedure described in
   authentication section.  This authentication TLV should be first TLV
   of PDU.  Add lifetime and config sequence TLVs defined in this
   document.  Both these TLVs are mandatory TLVs.  After the SA base
   message, add bgp service advertisement message with appropriate TLVs.

5.2.  Receiver procedure

   When a SA PDU received, following sanity procedure must be followed.

   If TTL is not 255 then discard the PDU.

   If the version is not compatible (Only compatible version is 0) then
   discard the PDU.

   If the PDU length is greater than IP header length, then discard it.

   If the first message is not SA Base, then discard the pdu.

   If authentication is enabled and first TLV in the SA base message,
   then discard the PDU.

   If authentication is enabled, then follow the authentication
   procedure.

   If authentication is failed, then discard the PDU.

   With above steps, sanity of the PDU header is verified.  Receiver
   should start decoding the TLV information.  Once all the TLV sanity
   checked receiver shall keep the decoded information.  If the receiver
   decides to keep the information, then it should start a timer with
   specified lifetime or refresh lifetime with newer one.

   The identifier in PDU header uniquely identifies the advertisement.
   An implementation could either implement neighbor semantic or state
   semantic from the advertised information along with identifier.  This
   document does not recommend one or other.

   Received and decoded information shall be passed on to bgp if the
   content does not match with last received or the local config has
   changed.  This is a desired optimization, so that SA does not
   unnecessarily trigger failed bgp session open attempts.  How bgp uses
   this information is beyond the scope of the document.

5.3.  Transport endpoint reachability

   Advertised local address reachability can either be gathered from the
   source address or a link address TLV.  Source address of the PDU may
   not give reachability for all deployment(Sender using the IPv6 data
   protocol but prefer v4 transport).  In those cases, link address TLV
   will provide reachability.

5.4.  Protocol Authentication operation

   A sender that wants to authenticate Service messages should include
   Authentication TLV as part of SA base message.

   Sender needs to include all the fields of Authentication TLV as shown
   in section 4.1.3.  It needs to assign a unique KEY-ID to each
   authentication combination configured on the device.  Key-length
   needs to be set to configured key's length in bytes.  Sequence number
   is a 32-bit unsigned integer that may increment by one each time a
   new message is sent.  Any change in TLVs for a previously advertised
   local address needs to be sent with an incremented TLV.  Digest value
   can be of variable length depending upon type of authentication being
   used.  This value is calculated over all the contents of service
   message.

   Receiver on receiving this TLV has a sequential processing of
   individual fields of TLV.  Sequence number is read from TLV and is
   compared against any existing state from this sender.  If sequence
   number is lesser than previously received, this packet is dropped
   except when bgp session goes down.If last received sequence number
   was m and current received sequence number is n, n needs be in range
   of [m+1, m + 2^(32 - 1)].  This exception is needed to handle a

   restarted sender who is unable to retrieve earlier sequence number
   due to restart.  This is required when SA uses bigger lifetime.
   After getting KEY-id, it checks for a matching KEY-ID on it.  If it
   does not exist, packet is dropped.  Next Key-length of locally
   configured key is compared against key-length received in this TLV,
   if they do not match packet is dropped.  Similarly, a comparison is
   done for authentication types of locally configured key and received
   TLV.  If they do not match, packet is dropped.  After above checks,
   hash is computed for all the contents of service with locally
   configured key and compared against received hash value.  If they are
   same, authentication information matches with local configuration and
   messages can be further processed with protocol operations depending
   on type of this message.

8.  Security Considerations

   This security considerations for BGP [RFC4271] apply equally to this
   extension for BGP session establishment.

   BGP sessions transport end points discovered over this protocol can
   be protected against various attacks by using authentication for
   packets as described in Section 5.4.

   Usage of seqeunce number and authentication reduces likelihood of
   replay attacks.  As the protocol is not connection-oriented, it makes
   it feasible to change authentication parameters for protocol
   messages.  This further reduces the likelihood of replay-attacks.
