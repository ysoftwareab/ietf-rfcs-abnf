   Local Mobility Anchor Initiated Flow Binding for Proxy Mobile IPv6
             draft-sarikaya-netext-lma-init-flow-binding-00

Abstract

   In network based mobility, flow mobility also should be network
   based.  This document defines two new Mobility Headers for a Local
   Mobility Anchor to control flow binding in a mobile node.  The proxy
   binding update messages containing these mobility headers are
   exchanged with Mobile Access Gateways.

Internet-Draft    LMA Initiated Flow Binding for PMIPv6    February 2010


1.  Introduction

   In Mobile IPv6, [I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding] allows a mobile node to
   bind a particular flow to a care-of address without affecting other
   flows using the same home address.  Binding Update (BU)/Binding
   Acknowledgement (BA) messages are extended for the mobile node to
   forward or discard a flow binding in a home agent.  The operations
   are always initiated by the mobile node.

   In Proxy Mobile IPv6, mobility of the mobile node is managed by the
   network.  Managing flow mobility by the network is inline with the
   way mobility is managed in PMIPv6.  The local mobility anchor would
   like to initiate flow binding operations, e.g, the local mobility
   anchor revokes a flow binding because of accounting insufficiency of
   the mobile node; the local mobility anchor moves a flow binding from
   one interface to another based on network resource availability; the
   local mobility anchor provisions default flow binding rules to the
   mobile node based on the mobile node's default profile.

   Flow binding operations are sent to Mobile Access Gateway.  In some
   cases they are sent to more than one: the current and future
   destination MAGs.  How these operations are communicated to MNs are
   out of scope with this document.

   This document defines two new Mobility Headers and several operations
   for the local mobility anchor to control flow binding in the mobile
   node.  It is assumed that flow binding state is previously created by
   Mobile Access Gateways sending Proxy Binding Update (PBU) messages
   that contain Flow Identification Mobility Options with action field
   set to 'forward'.  LMA forwards such a flow to Proxy-CoA of the
   mobile node, i.e.  MAG's address.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The terminology in this document is based on the definitions in
   [RFC3775] and [I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding].


3.  Protocol Operation

   It is assumed that the local mobility anchor has already created
   Binding Cache entries for the mobile node before launching flow
   binding operations.  Mobile access gateways establish flow binding

Internet-Draft    LMA Initiated Flow Binding for PMIPv6    February 2010


   state making use of Proxy Binding Update (PBU) /Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement(PBA) signalling to forward or discard flow binding at
   the local mobility anchor as described in
   [I-D.xia-netext-flow-binding].

   In this document, two Mobility Headers are defined, that is, Proxy
   Flow Binding Indication (PFBI) in Section 7.1.1 and Proxy Flow
   Binding Acknowledgement (PFBA) in Section 7.1.2.  PFBI is used by the
   local mobility anchor to initiate flow binding operations, while PFBA
   is used for acknowledging PFBI.

3.1.  Adding flow bindings

   Adding the flow binding means associating a flow with a particular
   Proxy-CoA for the mobile node.  LMA determines this address as
   follows internally based on the flow and the technology of the
   interface.  LMA first determines Proxy-CoA and the searches the
   binding cache to find the corresponding care-of address of MN's
   interface that connects to this interface.  LMA must include Care-of
   address in Target Care-of-Address sub-option defined in
   Section 7.2.3.  PFBI is sent to Proxy-CoA.

   When adding a new flow binding, the local mobility anchor sends a
   PFBI with a Flow Attribute option to the MAG.  The Flow Attribute
   option includes a unique FID.  The PRO field of the option MUST
   indicate an add operation.  The FID needs only be unique for the
   mobile node that PFBI belongs, i.e. the same FID can be used across
   different mobile nodes to identify different flows.  A lifetime value
   is included to indicate the remaining lifetime of the flow binding.
   Target care-of address sub-option must be included.

3.2.  Deleting flow bindings

   When removing a flow binding, the local mobility anchor node sends a
   FBI with a Flow Attribute option whose PRO field indicates Delete
   operation.  The Flow Attribute option includes a unique FID that was
   assigned when the flow was created to locate the flow binding and
   remove it.

3.3.  Modifying flow bindings

   When modifying a flow binding (either care-of address or other
   attributes of the flow), the local mobility anchor sends to the MAG a
   PFBI message with Flow Attribute option.  The option includes the FID
   for the binding being modified.  A flow description option may come
   with the Flow Attribute option and contain the new attributes needed
   to classify the flow.  Hence, flow modification is essentially a
   process where an existing flow definition is removed and a new flow



Sarikaya & Xia           Expires August 5, 2010                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft    LMA Initiated Flow Binding for PMIPv6    February 2010


   (included in the option) is added and given the same FID as the flow
   that was removed.

3.4.  Refreshing flow bindings

   A flow binding is refreshed by simply including the Flow Attribute
   option with Refresh PRO field in the FBI message.  The message should
   be sent before the expiration of the flow binding.  The message
   updates existing bindings with new information.  Hence, all
   information previously sent in the last refresh message need to be
   resent, otherwise such information will be lost.

3.5.  Moving flow bindings

   The local mobility anchor can move a flow associated to one interface
   of the multi-interfaced mobile node to another by sending a FBI
   message to the MAGs.  A Flow Attribute option whose PRO field is Move
   is included.  The address of the target interface of MN is also
   included in the Flow Attribute option's Target Care-of-Address sub-
   option.  This message must be sent to both the current and future
   destination MAGs of the flow.  LMA finds MAG addresses by searching
   the binding cache for this MN.

3.6.  Switching flow bindings

   Here are some example scenarios where a local mobility anchor signal
   to the mobile node that it should acquire a new local mobility anchor
   for some specific flows:
   o  The local mobility anchor is overloaded.
   o  An operator may wish to balance the load among local mobility
      anchors.
   o  Operators do periodic maintenance in order to maintain reliability
   o  ... ...

   The local mobility anchor sends the MAG a PFBI with Flow Attribute
   option to indicate that the mobile node should bind a flow to a new
   local mobility anchor.  The Alternate Local Mobility Anchor sub-
   option is included for the MAG to initiate the flow binding to a new
   local mobility anchor.

3.7.  Acknowledging flow bindings

   The mobile access gateway sends PFBA message to acknowledge the
   reception of Add, Delete, Modify, Refresh, Move, or Switch a flow
   binding.  On receiving messages with Flow Attribute option(s), the
   mobile access gateway should copy each flow Attribute to the
   acknowledging message.

4.  Handling of the Flow Bindings List

   Flow bindings list defined in [I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding] consisting
   of flow attribute options for each flow associated with this mobile
   node ordered with FID-PRI and FID values needs to be modified after
   each protocol operation defined above as follows:

   If PFBI contains a flow binding add operation and if the
   corresponding PFBA has a status code equal to zero, local mobility
   anchor MUST add a new entry to the flow bindings list.  FID, Flow
   Descriptor, FID-PRI and Action fields are taken from the Flow
   Attribute Option.  Care-of address is taken from Target Care-of-
   Address sub-option.

   If PFBI contains a flow binding delete operation and if the
   corresponding PFBA has a status code equal to zero, local mobility
   anchor MUST locate the list entry corresponding to this flow and then
   delete the entry.

   If PFBI contains a flow binding modify operation and if the
   corresponding PFBA has a status code equal to zero, local mobility
   anchor MUST delete the list entry corresponding to this flow and then
   add a new entry setting the values as defined in the Flow Attribute
   Option with care-of address set to the value in Target Care-of
   Address sub-option.

   If PFBI contains a flow binding refresh operation and if the
   corresponding PFBA has a status code equal to zero, local mobility
   anchor MUST locate the list entry corresponding to this flow and then
   set Active/Inactive Flag to Active.

   If PFBI contains a flow binding move operation and if the
   corresponding PFBA has a status code equal to zero, local mobility
   anchor MUST locate the list entry corresponding to this flow and then
   change the careof address to the the value in Target Care-of Address
   sub-option.

   If PFBI contains a flow binding switch operation and if the
   corresponding PFBA has a status code equal to zero, local mobility
   anchor MUST locate the list entry corresponding to this flow and then
   delete the entry.


5.  Mobile Access Gateway Considerations

   MAG MUST keep flow bindings list.  Mobile Access Gateway receives
   Proxy Flow Binding Indication messages from local mobility anchor.
   MAG adds the flow to the list of PRO field is an add operation.  MAG



Sarikaya & Xia           Expires August 5, 2010                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft    LMA Initiated Flow Binding for PMIPv6    February 2010


   deletes the flow if PRO field is a delete operation.  MAG starts LMA
   switch operations if PRO field is a switch operation.

   MAG action for move operation depends on if the MAG is the source or
   the destination of the move.  If the MAG is the source then it
   deletes the flow from the list and if the MAG is the destination , it
   adds the flow to the list.  MAG searches the care-of address in the
   Target Care-of-Address sub-option in its binding update list for this
   MN to determine that the corresponding Proxy-CoA is this MAG's
   address.

   If the operation is modify, MAG searches flow bindings list and
   deletes the current entry and adds a new one and sets its parameters
   as given in the flow attribute option.

   After PFBI message is successfuly processed MAG sends a Proxy Flow
   Binding Acknowledgement message to the LMA that sent PFBI message and
   sets status field to zero.


6.  IPv4 Flow Mobility Support

   PMIPv6 supports IPv4-only mobile nodes as described in
   [I-D.ietf-netlmm-pmip6-ipv4-support].  LMA-initiated flow mobility
   protocol defined in this document also supports IPv4.

   Care-of addresses can IPv4.  This happens when the mobile node
   attaches to a MAG and gets an IPv4 address (IPv4-MN-HoA).  There
   could be IPv4 transport between MAG and LMA.  When this happens, MAG
   uses IPv4-Proxy-CoA.  In all these cases IPv4-MN-HoA and IPv4-Proxy-
   CoA are stored in the binding cache at the local mobility anchor and
   binding update list at the mobile access gateway.

   During PFBI and PFBA exchanges between local mobility anchor and
   mobile access gateway, LMA sets care-of address in Target Care-of
   Address sub-option to IPv4-MN-HoA if MN's interface is IPv4 and sends
   PFBI as an IPv6 packet encapsulated in an IPv4 header to IPv4-Proxy-
   CoA if the IPv4 transport is used.

      the Proxy Flow Binding Indication was processed successfully by
      the receiving node.  Values greater than or equal to 128 indicate
      that the Proxy Flow Binding Indication was rejected by the receiving node.
      The following status values are currently defined:

          0  success
          1  partial success

      Option Len

         Length of option in 8-octet units

      PRO

         This is a 4-bit field that describes the required processing
         for the option.  It can be assigned one of the following values:

          0  Reserved
          1  Add a flow binding
          2  Delete a flow binding
          3  Modify a flow binding
          4  Refresh a flow binding
          5  Move a flow binding
          6  Switch a flow binding  to alternative local mobility anchors
          All other values are reserved

      PRI

         This is a 8-bit priority field to indicate the priority of a
         particular option.  This field is needed in cases where two
         different flow descriptions in two different options overlap.
         The priority field decides which policy should be in those
         cases.  A lower number in this field indicates a higher

         priority.

      FID

         The Flow Identifier field is an 16-bit unsigned integer that
         includes the identifier for the flow binding.  This field is
         used to refer to an existing binding or to create a new
         binding.

      Status

         This field indicates the success or failure of the flow binding
         operation for the particular flow in the option. Values from 0
         to 127 indicate success; Values of 128 and higher indicate failure.
         This field is only relevant when included in the Proxy Flow Binding
         Acknowledgement message and must be ignored in the Proxy Flow Binding
         Indication message.

      Reserved

         This field is unused.  It MUST be initialized to zero by the
         sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

      Lifetime

         16-bit unsigned integer. One time unit is 4 seconds. Except Deleting
         and Switching processing which the lifetime field is ignored, the
         lifetime in other PROs has the following meanings:

            Add,  the time remaining before the flow binding expired
            Modify, the lifetime of the modified flow binding
            Refresh, the lifetime of the refreshed flow binding
            Move, the lifetime of the moved flow binding

      Sub-options

         One or more sub-options may be included. These variable length
         options are defined in later sections.

      Flow Description

         Variable length field including attributes defining a flow.
