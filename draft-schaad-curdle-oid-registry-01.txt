     IANA Registration for Donated Symantec Website Security Object
                            Identifier Range
                  draft-schaad-curdle-oid-registry-01

Abstract

   When the Curdle Security Working Group was chartered, a range of
   object identifiers was donated by Symantec Website Security for the
   purpose of registering the Edwards Elliptic Curve key agreement and
   signature algorithms.  This donated set of OIDs allowed for shorter
   values than would be possible using the existing S/MIME or PKIX arcs.
   This document describes the range of identifiers that were assigned
   in that donated range, transfers control of that range to IANA, and
   establishes IANA allocation policies for any future assignments
   within that range.

1.  Introduction

   When the Curdle Security Working Group was chartered, a range of
   object identifiers was donated by Symantec Website Security for use
   by that working group.  The use of these object identifiers allowed
   for the Edwards Ellitptic Curve key agreement [RFC7748] and signature
   [RFC8032] algorithms to be defined with encodings that are smaller
   than similar ones would be if assigned from the existing S/MIME or
   PKIX arcs.  These initial registrations from this arc were done while
   developing [I-D.ietf-curdle-pkix].  After those registrations were
   done, there were still some unused values that can be used for other
   security groups, there were still some unused values.

   Object identifiers are primarily used with Abstract Syntax Notation
   (ASN.1) [ASN.1].  The ASN.1 specifications continue to evolve, but
   object identifiers can be used with any and all versions of ASN.1.

   This document describes the object identifiers that were assigned in
   that donated range, transfers control of the range to IANA, and
   establishes IANA allocation policies for any future assignments.

   The donated range from Symantec Website Security is:

   first: { iso (1) identified-organization (3) thawte (101) 100 }
   last: { iso (1) identified-organization (3) thawte (101) 127 }

2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to create one new registry table.

2.1.  "SMI Security for Cryptographic Algorithms" Registry

   Within the SMI-numbers registry, add an "SMI Security for
   Cryptographic Algorithms" table with the three columns:

   +---------+-----------------------------+---------------------------+
   | Decimal | Description                 | References                |
   +---------+-----------------------------+---------------------------+
   | 100     | Reserved for child reg      |                           |
   |         |                             |                           |
   | 110     | id-X25519                   | [I-D.ietf-curdle-pkix]    |
   |         |                             |                           |
   | 111     | id-X448                     | [I-D.ietf-curdle-pkix]    |
   |         |                             |                           |
   | 112     | id-EdDSA25519               | [I-D.ietf-curdle-pkix]    |
   |         |                             |                           |
   | 113     | id-EdDSA448                 | [I-D.ietf-curdle-pkix]    |
   |         |                             |                           |
   | 114     | Reserved for id-            | [I-D.ietf-curdle-pkix]-03 |
   |         | EdDSA25519-ph               |                           |
   |         |                             |                           |
   | 115     | Reserved for id-EdDSA448-ph | [I-D.ietf-curdle-pkix]-03 |
   +---------+-----------------------------+---------------------------+

   The column 'Decimal' is required to be a number between 100 and 127
   inclusive.

   The value of 100 has been reserved so that a new arc below that point
   can be established in the future.  (I.e. starting at 1.3.101.100.1)
   If the new child registry is established, a name for this value is to
   be assigned at that point.  The experts can, at their discretion,
   assign an algorithm OID instead.

   Future updates to this table require both 'Specification Required'
   and 'Expert Review' as defineed in [RFC5226].

3.  Security Considerations

   This document populates an IANA registry, and it raises no new
   security considerations.  The protocols that specify these values
   include the security considerations associated with their usage.
