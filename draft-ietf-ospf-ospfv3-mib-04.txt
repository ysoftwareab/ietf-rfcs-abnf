   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major 
   components: 
    
   o    An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1]. 
    
   o    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events 
        for the purpose of management. The first version of this 
        Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 
        and described in STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 
        [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The second version, called SMIv2, 
        is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [5], RFC 2579 [6] and 
        RFC 2580 [7]. 
    
   o    Message protocols for transferring management 
        information. The first version of the SNMP message 
        protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC 
        1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message protocol, 
        which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is 
        called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 
        [10]. The third version of the message protocol is called 
        SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and 
        RFC 2574 [12]. 
    
   o    Protocol operations for accessing management information. 
        The first set of protocol operations and associated PDU 
        formats is described in STD 15, RFC 1157  [8].  A second 
        set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is 
        described in RFC 1905 [13]. 
    
   o    A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 
        [14] and the view-based access control mechanism 
        described in RFC 2575 [15]. 
    
   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management 
   Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [16]. 
 
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
   termed the Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the 
   MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI. 
 
   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the 
   SMIv2. A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through 
   the appropriate translations. The resulting translated MIB 
   must be semantically equivalent, except where objects or 
   events are omitted because no translation is possible (use of 
   Counter64). Some machine readable information in SMIv2 will be 
   converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the 
   translation process. However, this loss of machine readable 
   information is not considered to change the semantics of the 
   MIB.

3. Overview 
    
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
   for managing the Open Shortest Path First Routing Protocol for IPv6, 
   otherwise known as OSPF version 3 (OSPFv3). Though the fundamental 
   mechanisms of OSPF version 2 (OSPFv2) remain unchanged in OSPFv3, 
   some changes were necessary due to differences in IP address size and 
   in protocol semantics between IPv4 and IPv6. An attempt was made to 
   align the OSPFv3 MIB as closely as possible with the OSPFv2 MIB. The 
   following subsections highlight the major differences between the 
   OSPFv2 MIB and the OSPFv3 MIB. A detailed list of differences can be 
   found in Appendix A. 
    
   3.1. IPv6 Interfaces 
    
   IPv6 interfaces attach to links [17]. A link is roughly defined as 
   the layer below IPv6 (e.g. Ethernet, IPv4 Tunnel). One or more IPv6 
   prefixes can be associated with an IPv6 interface. IPv6 interfaces 
   and the prefixes associated with those interfaces can be configured 
   via the IPV6-MIB [20]. IPv6 interfaces are configured in the IPv6 
   Interface Table and IPv6 prefixes are configured in the IPv6 Address 
   Prefix Table. An IPv6 interface is identified by a unique index 
   value. IPv6 Address Prefix Table entries associated with an IPv6 
   interface reference the interface's index. 
    
   Whereas an interface identifier in OSPFv2 is a local IPv4 address or 
   MIB-2 interface index, an OSPFv3 interface identifier is an IPv6 
   interface index. For example, the index value of an OSPFv3 Interface 
   Table entry is the IPv6 interface index of the IPv6 interface over 
   which OSPFv3 is configured to operate. 
    
   3.2. Addressing Semantics 
    
   Router ID, Area ID and Link State ID remain at the OSPFv2 size of 32 
   bits, therefore, they cannot be assigned IPv6 addresses. A router 
   running both IPv4 and IPv6 concurrently can continue to use a local 
   IPv4 interface address as the OSPFv3 router ID. Otherwise, the router 
   ID must be selected using another method (e.g. administratively 
   assigned). The Link State ID has no addressing semantics in OSPFv3. 
    
   The syntax of Router ID, Area ID and Link State ID remains the same 
   as in the OSPFv2 MIB(i.e. ipAddress). The order of the Router ID and 
   Link State ID index components in Link State Database Tables are 
   reversed in OSPFv3 since the lack of addressing semantics in Link 
   State IDs make them less unique identifiers than the Router ID. It is 
   more useful to do partial OID lookups extending to the Router ID 
   rather than the LSID. 
     
   3.3. Authentication 
    
   In OSPFv3, authentication has been removed from the protocol itself. 
   MIB objects related to authentication are not carried forward from 
   the OSPFv2 MIB.

   3.4. Type of Service 
    
   OSPFv2 MIB objects related to Type of Service (ToS) are not carried 
   forward to the OSPFv3 MIB.  
    
   3.5. Flooding Scope 
    
   Flooding scope for LSAs has been generalized and is now explicitly 
   coded in the LSA's LS type field. The action to take upon receipt of 
   unknown LSA types is also coded in the LS type field [19]. The 
   OSPFv3 MIB defines three Link State Database tables, one each for 
   Area-scope LSAs, Link-scope LSAs and AS-scope LSAs. 
    
   3.6. Virtual Links 
    
   Since addressing semantics have been removed from router-LSAs in 
   OSPFv3, Virtual Links now need to be assigned an interface ID for 
   advertisement in Hello packets and in router-LSAs. An object has 
   been added to the Virtual Interface Table row entry for this 
   purpose. 
 
 
    
4. Structure of the OSPFv3 MIB 
    
   The MIB is composed of the following sections: 
    
        General Variables 
        Area Table 
        Area-Scope Link State Database 
        Link-Scope Link State Database 
        AS-Scope Link State Database 
        Host Table 
        Interface Table 
        Virtual Interface Table 
        Neighbor Table 
        Virtual Neighbor Table 
        Aggregate Range Table 
    
   4.1.  General Variables 
    
   The General Variables are global to the OSPFv3 Process. 
    
   4.2.  Area Table 
    
   The Area Data Structure describes the OSPFv3  Areas  that  the 
   router participates in. 
    
   4.3.   Area-Scope, Link-Scope and AS-Scope Link State Database 
    
   The Link State  Databases  are  provided  primarily  to  provide 
   detailed information for network debugging.

   4.4.  Host Table 
    
   The Host Table is  provided  to  view  configured  Host  Route 
   information. 
    
   4.5.  Interface Table 
    
   The Interface Table describes the various IPv6 links on  which 
   OSPFv3 is configured. 
    
   4.6.  Virtual Interface Table 
    
   The Virtual Interface Table describes virtual OSPFv3 links. 
    
   4.7.  Neighbor and Virtual Neighbor Tables 
    
   The Neighbor Table and the Virtual Neighbor Table describe the 
   neighbors to the OSPFv3 Process. 
    
   4.8.  Aggregate Range Table 
    
   The Aggregate Range Table describes prefixes  which  summarize 
   routing information for export outside of an Area.

                cast Extensions to OSPF. 
 
                Bit 0, if set, indicates that  the  router  can 
                forward  IPv6 multicast datagrams in the router's 
                directly attached areas (called intra-area mul- 
                ticast routing). 
 
                Bit 1, if set, indicates that  the  router  can 
                forward  IPv6  multicast  datagrams  between OSPFv3 
                areas (called inter-area multicast routing). 
 
                Bit 2, if set, indicates that  the  router  can 
                forward  IPv6  multicast  datagrams between Auto- 
                nomous Systems (called inter-AS multicast rout- 
                ing). 
 
                Only certain combinations of bit  settings  are 
                allowed,  namely: 0 (no multicast forwarding is 
                enabled), 1 (intra-area multicasting  only),  3 
                (intra-area  and  inter-area  multicasting),  5 
                (intra-area and inter-AS  multicasting)  and  7 
                (multicasting  everywhere). By default, no mul- 
                ticast forwarding is enabled."

8. Security Considerations 
    
   There are a number of management objects defined in  this  MIB 
   that  have  a  MAX-ACCESS  clause  of  read-write and/or read- 
   create.   Such  objects  may  be   considered   sensitive   or 
   vulnerable  in some network environments.  The support for SET 
   operations  in  a  non-secure   environment   without   proper 
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations. 

 

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network 
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is 
   no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and 
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB. 
    
   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security 
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use 
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View- 
   based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended. 
    
   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP 
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly 
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals 
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET 
   (change/create/delete) them.

A. Differences from RFC 1850 
    
     (1)  Textual Conventions are imported from IPV6-TC  and  OSPF- 
          MIB MIBs. 
 
     (2)  The  "ospf"  prefix  for  entity  names  is  changed   to 
          "ospfv3". 
 
     (3)  General Group object name ospfVersionNumber is changed to 
          ospfv3VersionNumber and its value is changed from 2 to 3. 
 
     (4)  General Group object name ospfExternLsaCount  is  changed 
          to  ospfv3AsScopeLsaCount  to  indicate  count of all AS-

          scoped LSAs in the database. 
 
     (5)  General  Group  object  name   ospfExternLsaCksumSum   is 
          changed  to ospfv3AsScopeCksumSum to indicate checksum of 
          all AS-scoped LSAs in the database. 
 
     (6)  Removed General Group object ospfTOSSupport. 
 
     (7)  Removed ospfAuthType object from Area entry. 
 
     (8)  Changed     object     names     ospfAreaLsaCount     and 
          ospfAreaLsaCksumSum    to   ospfv3AreaScopeLsaCount   and 
          ospfv3AreaScopeLsaCksumSum. 
 
     (9)  Removed OSPF Area Default Metric Table. 
 
     (10) Added object ospfv3StubMetric to Area entry as substitute 
          for Area Default Metric Table. 
 
     (11) Changed name of External  LSDB  Table  to  AS-Scope  LSDB 
          Table.   Replaced  object  name prefix "ospfExtLsdb" with 
          "ospfv3AsLsdb". 
 
     (12) Changed name of LSDB  Table  to  Area-Scope  LSDB  Table. 
          Replaced    object    name    prefix    "ospfLsdb"   with 
          "ospfv3AreaLsdb". 
 
     (13) Added ospfv3LinkLsdbTable  which  contains  all  LSAs  of 
          Link-Scope.    Index   of   ospfv3LinkLsdbTable  is  IPv6 
          interface index, LSA Type, Router ID and LSID. 
 
     (14) Re-ordered Router ID and LSID index  components  of  LSDB 
          table  entries.   Since  LSIDs  no longer have addressing 
          semantics, GET-NEXT operations on partial OIDs  are  more 
          useful when the Router ID component comes before the LSID 
          component. 
 
     (15) Address Range Table is removed. 
 
     (16) Removed  ospfHostTOS  from  Host  Table   entry.   Object 
          ospfHostIpAddress  changed  to ospfv3HostIpv6Address with 
          SYNTAX changed from IpAddress to Ipv6Address. 
 
     (17) The  MAX-ACCESS  value  of  object  ospfv3HostAreaID   is 
          changed to read-create. 
 
     (18) Objects  ospfIfIpAddress  and  ospfAddressLessIf  removed 
          from  Interface  entry and as Interface Table entry index 
          components. 
 
     (19) Object ospfv3IfIndex added to Interface Table entry  with 
          SYNTAX  Ipv6IfIndex.   It  replaces  ospfIfIpAddress  and 
          ospfAddressLessIf as the Interface Table entry index.

     (20) The  SYNTAX   of   objects   ospfIfDesignatedRouter   and 
          ospfIfBackupDesignatedRouter is changed from IpAddress to 
          RouterID. 
 
     (21) Objects ospfIfAuthType and ospfIfAuthKey are removed from 
          Interface and Virtual Interface entries. 
 
     (22) Added     objects      ospfv3IfLinkScopeLsaCount      and 
          ospfv3IfLinkLsaCksumSum to Interface entry. They maintain 
          the count of Link-Scope LSAs  and  the  checksum  of  the 
          Link-Scope LSA database associated with the interface. 
 
     (23) Removed  OSPF  Interface  Metric  Table.  Metric  is  now 
          accessed  via object ospfv3IfMetricValue in the Interface 
          entry. 
 
     (24) Added object ospfv3IfInstId to Interface entry to  enable 
          the  setting  of  the  interface  instance  value  of the 
          interface. The default value is zero. 
 
     (25) Added object ospfv3VirtIfIndex to Virtual Interface entry 
          which  is  used  to  assign  a  local interface ID to the 
          virtual interface. 
 
     (26) Added    objects    ospfv3VirtIfLinkScopeLsaCount     and 
          ospfv3VirtIfLinkLsaCksumSum  to  Virtual Interface entry. 
          They maintain  the  count  of  Link-Scope  LSAs  and  the 
          checksum  of  the Link-Scope LSA database associated with 
          the virtual interface. 
 
     (27) Removed objects ospfNbrIpAddr and ospfNbrAddressLessIndex 
          from Neighbor entry. 
 
     (28) Added object ospfv3NbrIfIndex to Neighbor  entry.   Index 
          components  ospfNbrIpAddr and ospfNbrAddressLessIndex are 
          replaced with ospfv3NbrIfIndex and ospfv3NbrIpv6Addr. 
 
     (29) Added object ospfv3NbrIfId to Neighbor entry. This object 
          contains  the  neighbor's  local interface index from the 
          neighbor's hellos advertised on the link. 
 
     (30) Added object  ospfv3VirtNbrIfIndex  to  Virtual  Neighbor 
          entry.  This  is  the interface index of the virtual link 
          over which the virtual neighbor is reached. 
 
     (31) Changed     object     name     ospfVirtNbrIpAddr      to 
          ospfv3VirtNbrIpv6Addr   and   SYNTAX  from  IpAddress  to 
          Ipv6Address. 
 
     (32) Added object ospfv3VirtNbrIfId to Virtual Neighbor entry. 
          This  is  the  virtual neighbor's local virtual interface 
          index  from  the  neighbor's  hellos  advertised  on  the

          virtual link. 
 
     (33) Added object ospfv3AreaAggregateIndex to  Area  Aggregate 
          entry.  This  allows  for  a  fixed length index for Area 
          Aggregate Table entries. 
 
     (34) Replaced      object      ospfAreaAggregateMask      with 
          ospfv3AreaAggregatePrefixLen. 
 
     (35) Replaced      object      ospfAreaAggregateNet       with 
          ospfv3AreaAggregatePrefix. 
 
     (36) Index  for  Area  Aggregate  Table  entry  changed   from 
          ospfAreaAggregateAreaID,       ospfAreaAggregateLsdbType, 
          ospfAreaAggregateNet,      ospfAreaAggregateMask       to 
          ospfv3AreaAggregateAreaID, 
          ospfv3AreaAggregateAreaLsdbType, 
          ospfv3AreaAggregateIndex. 
 
     (37) Conformance information  is  changed  to  reflect  object
