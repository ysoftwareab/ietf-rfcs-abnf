1.  Introduction

   This document profiles the Metadata Query Protocol
   [I-D.young-md-query] for use with SAML metadata [SAML2Meta].

   The Research and Education Federations group ([REFEDS]) is the voice
   that articulates the mutual needs of research and education identity
   federations worldwide.  It aims to represent the requirements of
   research and education in the ever-growing space of access and
   identity management.

   From time to time REFEDS will wish to publish a document in the
   Internet RFC series.  Such documents will be published as part of the
   RFC Independent Submission Stream [RFC4844]; however the REFEDS
   working group sign-off process will have been followed for these
   documents, as described in the REFEDS Participant's Agreement
   [REFEDS.agreement].

   This document is a product of the REFEDS Working Group process.

Internet-DraftSAML Profile for the Metadata Query Protocol    April 2014


1.1.  Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [BCP14].

   This document makes use of the Augmented BNF metalanguage defined in
   [STD68].

2.  Request Profile

2.1.  Content Type

   Requests compliant with this profile MUST include the following HTTP
   header to indicate that the metadata returned should be SAML metadata
   (see Appendix A of [SAML2Meta]):

   Accept: application/samlmetadata+xml

2.2.  Identifiers

   Each identifier in a request may be either:

   o  The unique identifier of an entity, corresponding to the
      "entityID" attribute of the entity's "EntityDescriptor" element in
      SAML metadata, or

   o  The responder-defined identifier of an arbitrary group of
      entities.

   SAML 2.0 [SAML2Core] includes profiles based on the transfer of an
   "artifact" containing the unique identifier of a SAML entity
   transformed by means of the SHA-1 [RFC3174] hash algorithm (see
   [SAML2Bind] sections 3.6 and 3.6.4).

   In order to support use cases in which clients may be in possession
   of only such a transformed representation of a SAML entity's unique
   identifier without any way to establish the original entity
   identifier, a responder compliant with this profile MUST accept an
   extended identifier matching the "sha1id" production in the following
   ABNF grammar as as equivalent to the corresponding untransformed
   identifier:

   SHA1     = %x73 %x68 %x61 %x31 ; lower case "sha1"
   DIGIT    = %x30-39
   HEXDIGIT = DIGIT | %x61-66 ; lower case a-f
   sha1id   = "{" SHA1 "}" sha1hex
   sha1hex  = 40*HEXDIGIT

Internet-DraftSAML Profile for the Metadata Query Protocol    April 2014


   In the above, the "sha1hex" component encodes the 20-octet (160-bit)
   binary SHA-1 hash value as a sequence of 40 lower case hexadecimal
   digits.

   For example, the identifier

   http://example.org/service

   transformed by means of SHA-1 hashing would become

   {sha1}11d72e8cf351eb6c75c721e838f469677ab41bdb

   Malformed SHA-1 transformed extended identifiers, for example where
   the string of characters following the "}" contains characters other
   than hexadecimal digits, or is other than exactly 40 characters in
   length, MUST result in an HTTP status code of 400 ("bad request").

3.  Response Profile

3.1.  Response Cardinality

   A request may return information for any number of entities,
   including none.  Responses compliant with this profile MUST use the
   appropriate representation described below depending on the number of
   "EntityDescriptor" elements returned.

3.1.1.  No Entity Descriptors Returned

   A response which returns no "EntityDescriptor" elements MUST be
   represented by an HTTP status code of 404 ("not found").

3.1.2.  One Entity Descriptor Returned

   A response which returns a single "EntityDescriptor" element MUST use
   that element as its document element.  The responder MUST NOT make
   use of a "EntitiesDescriptor" element in this situation (see
   [SAML2Meta] section 2.3).

   Such a response MUST include the following HTTP header to indicate
   that the metadata returned is SAML metadata:

   Content-Type: application/samlmetadata+xml

3.1.3.  More Than One Entity Descriptor Returned

   A response which returns more than one "EntityDescriptor" element
   MUST consist of a document element which is an "EntitiesDescriptor"
   element, containing the returned "EntityDescriptor" elements as

   children.  Responses MUST NOT contain nested "EntitiesDescriptor"
   elements.

   Such a response MUST include the following HTTP header to indicate
   that the metadata returned is SAML metadata:

   Content-Type: application/samlmetadata+xml

4.  Security Considerations

4.1.  Integrity

   As SAML metadata contains information necessary for the secure
   operation of interacting services it is strongly RECOMMENDED that a
   mechanism for integrity checking is provided to clients.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the integrity checking mechanism provided by a
   responder is a digital signature embedded in the returned metadata
   document, as defined by [SAML2Meta] section 3.

   Such digital signatures:

   o  SHOULD use an RSA keypair whose modulus is no less than 2048 bits
      in length.

   o  SHOULD NOT use the SHA-1 cryptographic hash algorithm as a digest
      algorithm.

   o  MUST NOT use the MD5 cryptographic hash algorithm as a digest
      algorithm.

   o  SHOULD otherwise follow current cryptographic best practices in
      algorithm selection.

4.2.  Use of SHA-1 in Transformed Identifiers

   This profile mandates the availability of a identifier synonym
   mechanism based on the SHA-1 cryptographic hash algorithm.  Although
   SHA-1 is now regarded as weak enough to exclude it from use in new
   cryptographic systems, its use in this profile is necessary for full
   support of the SAML 2.0 standard.

   Because the SHA-1 cryptographic hash is not being used within this
   profile in the context of a digital signature, it is not believed to
   introduce a security concern over and above that which already exists
   in SAML due to the possibility of a post-hash collision between
   entities whose "entityID" attributes hash to the same value.

Internet-DraftSAML Profile for the Metadata Query Protocol    April 2014


   Implementations may guard against this possibility by treating two
   entities whose "entityID" values have the same SHA-1 equivalent as an
   indicator of malicious intent on the part of the owner of one of the
   entities.

5.  IANA Considerations
