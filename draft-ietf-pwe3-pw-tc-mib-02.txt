2        Introduction
   
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
   community. In particular, it defines Textual Conventions used in
   IETF PW and PW-related MIBs.
   
   Comments should be made directly to the MPLS mailing list at
   pwe3@ietf.org.
   
   For an introduction to the concepts of Pseudo-Wires, see [PWREQ]
   and [FRMWK].
   
Conventions used in this document
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119
   [BCP14].
   

3       Terminology
   
   This document uses terminology from the document describing the PW
   framework [FRMWK].
   
4       The SNMP Management Framework
  
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].
