  The Time Zone Data Distribution Service (TZDIST) Geolocate Extension
                  draft-murchison-tzdist-geolocate-02

Abstract

   This document defines an extension to the Time Zone Data Distribution
   Service (RFC 7808) to allow a client to determine the correct time
   zone for a geographic point location using a 'geo' URI (RFC 5870).

1.  Introduction

   Clients using a Time Zone Data Distribution Service (TZDIST),
   particularly mobile clients, may not have prior knowledge of which
   time zone is appropriate for a particular geographic region.  This
   specification defines a new TZDIST service action to allow a client
   to query a server with a geographic point location and have that
   server determine if the location lies within the boundaries of an
   existing time zone and return the corresponding time zone identifier.

   This specification does not define the source of the time zone
   boundary data.  It is assumed that a reliable and accurate source is
   available.  One such source is the Time Zone Boundary Builder [TZBB].

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   This specification contains examples of HTTP requests and responses.
   In some cases, additional line breaks have been introduced into the
   request or response data to match maximum line-length limits of this
   document.

3.  "geolocate" Action

   Name:  geolocate

   Request-URI Template:
      {/service-prefix,data-prefix}/zones{?location}

   Description:  This action allows a client to query the time zone data
      distribution service for the time zone identifier corresponding to
      the given geographic point location, specified as a 'geo' URI
      [RFC5870].

      If the 'geo' URI specifies an uncertainty value (";u=" parameter),
      the server MUST return the time zone identifiers for all time
      zones whose boundary passes through the radius of uncertainty.  In
      the absence of a client-supplied uncertainty value, the server MAY
      use an implicit uncertainty to coincide with any uncertainty in
      the time zone boundary data that it uses.

      If the 'geo' URI specifies a coordinate reference system (";crs="
      parameter) that is unsupported by the server, the server SHOULD
      return a JSON "problem details" object [RFC7807] in the response
      body including a "type" member with an "invalid-location" error
      URN as defined below.

   Parameters:

      location=<geo-URI>  REQUIRED, and MUST occur only once.

   Response:  The response has the same format as the "list" and "find"
      actions (see [RFC7808] Section 6.2), with one result object for
      each geolocated time zone.  If for any reason the server can not
      determine a time zone in which the point is located (e.g.
      uninhabited location), it MUST return a "list" response containing
      zero time zone objects.

   Possible Error Codes

      urn:ietf:params:tzdist:error:invalid-location  The "location" URI
         query parameter has an incorrect or unsupported value or
         appears more than once.

3.1.  Examples: geolocate action

   The examples below presume that the timezone context path has been
   discovered (see [RFC7808] Section 4.2.1) to be "/tzdist".

   In this example the client asks for the time zone corresponding to
   the Royal Observatory, Greenwich [ROG].

   In this example the client asks for the timezone corresponding to the
   Niagara Falls [NF] with an uncertainty of 50m.  Note that the
   cataracts are located on the border of Ontario, Canada, and New York,
   United States, and therefore straddle a time zone boundary.

4.  Security Considerations

   This specification does not introduce any additional security
   concerns beyond those described in Section 8 of [RFC7808]

5.  Privacy Considerations

   A client that uses this extension will leak the precise location of a
   user's device.  The strategies described in Section 9 of [RFC7808]
   can be used to diminish the ability of an untrusted server or network
   observer to track the device.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Service Action Registration

   This document defines the following new TZDIST Service Action to be
   added to the registry defined in Section 10.3.1 of [RFC7808]:

                   +-------------+--------------------+
                   | Action Name | Reference          |
                   +-------------+--------------------+
                   | geolocate   | RFCXXXX, Section 3 |
                   +-------------+--------------------+

6.2.  Registration of invalid-location Error URN

   This section registers the "urn:ietf:params:tzdist:error:invalid-
   location" URN in the "TZDIST Identifiers" registry defined in
   Section 10.4 of [RFC7808].

   URN:  urn:ietf:params:tzdist:error:invalid-location

   Description:  Error code for incorrect use of the "location" URI
      query parameter.

   Specification:  RFCXXXX, Section 3
