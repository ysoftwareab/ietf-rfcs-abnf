TTL=2 uses UDP port 55002, etc.).  The mechanism described here uses
icmpSocket=socket(config.remoteAddr.ss_family, SOCK_DGRAM,
                         IPPROTO_ICMP); <<<

icmpSocket=socket(config.remoteAddr.ss_family, SOCK_RAW,
cc = recvfrom(sendsocket, receivepacket,
                       sizeof(receivepacket), 0,
                       (struct sockaddr *)&receiveaddr, (int*)&fromlen);
