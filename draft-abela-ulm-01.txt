Abstract

   This document presents a format to describe system events for logging
   purpose.  Some of the features presented here are in use with the
   common syslog facility, but most of them are lost in the crowd of
   syslog format freedom.

Introduction

   At the beginning, logs were scanned by the administrator after an
   incident to detect the failure cause. With the increasing concern on
   computer security, and wide area network manangement, the need for
   automated log examination, extraction and reporting has grown.  The
   Universal Logger Message (ULM) format presented here is a set of
   guidelines to formalize the semantics of such messages.

Syntax

   The ABNF for ULM is:

   log_file    = *(log_line LF)

   log_line    = field *(SP field)



Abela                                                           [Page 1]





INTERNET-DRAFT         Universal Logger Messages         22 January 1997


   field       = field_name "=" field_value

   field_name  = ALPHA *(ALPHA_EXT)
                   (Case is not significant)

   field_value = *(ALPHA_EXT) / string

   string      = QUOTE *(ANY) QUOTE
                   (inside quotes and backslashes
                   must be escaped with a backslash)

   ANY         = <any CHAR excluding all control characters
                   (US ASCII 0-31 inclusive)>

   ALPHA_EXT   = ALPHA / DIGIT / "." / "-" / "_"

   QUOTE       = <the double quote character (ASCII decimal code 34)>

   ALPHA       = <any one of the 52 alphabetic characters
                   (A through Z in upper case
                   and a through z in lower case)>

   DIGIT       = <any one of the 10 numeric characters (0 through 9)>

   LF          = <the line-feed character (ASCII decimal code 10)>

   SP          = <the space character (ASCII decimal code 32)>

   Due to the verbosity of ULM, field names should be chosen as short as
   possible: 4 characters are a maximum for a field name element.

   Here is a correct syslog message:

   Jan 20 00:05:03 myhost: 10.3.2.1 tuttle from space.foo-bar.com
   (10.3.3.5) 3456

   Its meaning is however context and reader dependant, and could not be
   parsed successfully without a precise knowledge of all the type of
   messages wich could happen. An ULM for this could be:

   DATE=19970120000503 HOST=itesec PRG=foo-gw LVL=debug PS=3456
   DST.IP=10.3.2.1 DST.USR=tuttle SRC.IP=10.3.3.5 SRC.FQDN=space.foo-
   bar.com

Mandatory Fields

   The following fields should be present in any ULM: LVL, HOST, PRG,
   DATE.  This requirement is not enforced through the examples of this

   document.

   LVL

       value.level = "Emergency" / "Alert" / "Error"
                      / "Warning" / "Auth" / "Security"
                      / "Usage" / "System" / "Important" / "Debug"

       The level (LVL) field specifies the importance and category of
       the ULM.  The meaning for the different values are:

       Emergency

           A panic condition. It should be broadcast to all users.

       Alert

           A condition that should be corrected immediately.

       Error

           A system error. This level and the previous ones are reserved
           for system conditions.

       Warning

           A program error. A program has detected an incorrect
           behaviour of his own. To clarify the differences between
           these last levels: Absence of a system configuration file is
           an Error, failed assert is a Warning, and erroneous data
           given by a user is never anything more than a Debug (except
           when asked for authentication pasphrase, see below).

       Auth

           An authentication happened.  Potential senders for such an
           ULM could be su and login.  The STAT field may give more
           informations; if not specified, an authentication failure is
           assumed, as in:

           PRG=su LVL=Auth PS=2894 SRC.USR=tuttle DST.USR=root

           PRG=su LVL=Auth PS=2895 SRC.USR=tuttle DST.USR=root
           STAT=Success

       Security

           A standard protection was raised against what could be an

INTERNET-DRAFT         Universal Logger Messages         22 January 1997


           intrusion.  A connection denial based on the remote network
           address falls into this category. The STAT field may give
           more informations; if not specified, a failure is assumed, as
           in:

           PRG=tcpwrapper LVL=Security SRC.NAME=evil.foo-bar.com

       Usage

           Normal, standard, authorized day-to-day usage information. If
           an application has to report delayed information about what
           is used, it should be reported as debugging information first
           (for crashproof logging), then summaried into an only usage
           message.

           DATE=19970120000503 PRG=www-client LVL=Debug STAT=Start

           DATE=19970120000551 PRG=www-client LVL=Debug STAT=End

           DATE=19970120000551 PRG=www-client LVL=Usage DUR=48

       System

           Tangible usage, but not traceable to any user. Automated
           processus or system batch jobs fall into this category.

           PRG=sshd LVL=System PS=175 MSG="RSA key generation" DUR=37

       Important

           Important information which could become critical, but is not
           yet.  A configuration change may be an important information.


       Debug

           The Debug level ULMs are not interesting at all in the normal
           course of life, they add no information when everything is in
           order.

   HOST

       value.host  = string

       The HOST field contains the name of the host which issues the
       ULM.

   PROG



Abela                                                           [Page 4]





INTERNET-DRAFT         Universal Logger Messages         22 January 1997


       value.prog  = string

       The PROG field contains the name of the software component which
       issues the ULM. If a software component is a member of a software
       suite, it should be expressed in a hierarchical, as in:
       "suite.component.subcomponent".

   DATE

       value.date  = <YYYY> <MM> <DD> <hh> <mm> <ss> [ ( '+' / '-' )
       <hh> <mm> ]

       The DATE field contains the instantaneous date of the event. If
       the event lasts a sufficient amount of time, different ULM sould
       be issued, each marked with its own date.

       The given date must either be in GMT, or include a timezone
       information.

Optional Fields

   The following fields could be added in any ULM. Any application
   reading log files should understand them: DUR, PS, ID, SRC.IP,
   SRC.FQDN, SRC.NAME, SRC.PORT, SRC.USR, SRC.MAIL, DST.*, REL.*, VOL,
   VOL.SENT, VOL.RCVD, CNT, CNT.SENT, CNT.RCVD, STAT, TTY, DOC, PROT,
   CMD, MSG.

   DUR

       value.duration = integer

       The DURATION indicates the duration (in seconds) of the event
       which end is given by the DATE field. This field is mandatory if
       the ULM announces the end of an event for which another ULM was
       issued at the beginning.

   PS

       value.process = integer

       In a multi-tasking environment, this field specifies the process
       id which issued the ULM. On some systems, this id may not be
       unique, but it should however be unique on the specified HOST,
       over the specified DUR, if appropriate.  Thus, the ULM announcing
       the end of a session should specify the duration of the session,
       and guarantee that all the ULM issued between the beginning of
       the session and this ULM with the same HOST value and the same PS
       values concern that session.

INTERNET-DRAFT         Universal Logger Messages         22 January 1997


   ID

       value.id = string

       The ID field is a system reference to the concerned document. It
       could be a mail or Usenet news message-id, or an incremented
       counter. It should not be mistaken with the DOC field, which a
       user-level name.

   SRC.IP

       value.source.ip   = ipv4 / ipv6

       The SRC.IP field contains the IP number of the source host.
       Other SRC.* fields could describe network source addresses in
       other realms (IPX, X25, ...).

       The SRC.* fields all contain informations about the connected,
       connecting, or trying to connect host.

   SRC.FQDN

       value.source.fqdn = string

       Fully Qualified Domain Name for the source host.

   SRC.NAME

       value.source.name = string

       Generic name qualifying the source: a host name if fqdn is not
       available, or a full user name.

   SRC.PORT

       value.source.port = integer

       Port number for TCP, UDP or another protocol.

   SRC.USR

       value.source.user = string

       User name or user id.

   SRC.MAIL

       value.source.mail = string

INTERNET-DRAFT         Universal Logger Messages         22 January 1997


       E-mail address.

   DST.IP DST.FQDN DST.NAME DST.PORT DST.USR DST.MAIL

       All the DST.* fields have the same meaning as the SRC.* fields,
       except that they qualify the destination.

   REL.IP REL.FQDN REL.NAME REL.PORT REL.USR REL.MAIL

       All the REL.* fields have the same meaning as the SRC.* fields,
       except that they qualify a proxy, or relayer, or some sort of
       man-in-the-middle.

   VOL VOL.SENT VOL.RCVD CNT CNT.SENT CNT.RCVD

       Volume (number of bytes) and count (of articles, files, events)
       sent, and received, from the source point of view. CNT=1 is
       always implicit.  These fields allow ULM to be merged together,
       in which case, the VOL and CNT fields may be added together, if
       the other ones match.

   STAT

       The STAT field describes the state or status of the designed
       process.  Possible values for this field may include "Failure",
       "Success", "Start", "End".

   TTY

       value.tty = string

       The tty field describes the user's physical connection to the
       host.

   DOC

       value.document = string

       The document (DOC) field is the name of an accessed document,
       like the path of an ftp file, the name of a newsgroup, or the
       non-host part of an URL.

   PROT

       value.protocol = string

       The protocol (PROT) field specifies the protocol used.

INTERNET-DRAFT         Universal Logger Messages         22 January 1997


       PRG=sendmail VOL=2238 PROT=ESMTP

       PRG=sshd PROT=RSA LVL=Auth STAT=Success

   CMD

       value.command = string

       The command (CMD) field is an issued command, as in:

       PRG=cron LVL=Usage SRC.USR=news CMD="/local/news/bin/news.daily
       expireover delayrm" DUR=927

       PRG=ftpd LVL=Usage PS=10359 CMD=RETR DOC=x11.tar.gz

   MSG

       value.message = string

       The message (MSG) field is the only field which should contain
       arbitrary data.  Any important information that doesn't fit any
       of the other standard fields may be stored here. Using the
       message field for information fitting in standard field is
       forbidden.


Other more fields

   Any other field of interest could be added, but it should be
   registered first to the Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA).

Security Considerations

   ULM includes no security functions. However, sites should worry about
   the vulnerabilites of their logging architecture, especially when
   networks are used to transport ULM, as these messages may be critical
   for the security.
