Abstract

This memo introduces three new e-mail (RFC 822) headers, Auto-Submitted,
Supersedes, and Expires.


Differences from previous version

Some minor wording changes in the definitions of what is and what is not
to be regarded as autosubmitted, otherwise no changes. If an automatic
message is generated whenever a file has been changed by a human, is
this auto-submitted or not? The spec now says that if the SMTP-sender of
such a notification is the human who changed the file, then this is not
auto-submitted, but otherwise it is. But the spec also says that this is
a borderline case, and that exact definitions of the border between
auto-submitted and not auto-submitted cannot always be made.

1.    Introduction

This memo introduces three new headers for Internet e-mail (RFC 822)
headers which will enhance the e-mail service in various ways. The names
of the new headers are: Auto-Submitted, Supersedes and Expires.


2.    Auto-Submitted

2.1   Syntax:

     auto-submitted-field     = "Auto-Submitted ":"
                                auto-submitted

     auto-submitted           = ( "no" / "auto-generated" /
                                "auto-replied" /
                                "x-" <private-extension> /
                                "<future-extension> )
                                <optional-parameter-list>

    <optional-parameter-list> = *( ";" <optional-parameter> )

Note 1: All the syntax specified above is case-insensitive. Thus
"Auto-Submitted: Auto-Replied" is identical to "auto-submitted:
auto-replied" or "aUTO-sUBMITTED: aUTO-rEPLIED".

Note 2: <private extension>, <future extension> and <optional-parameter>
are not defined in this standard, but their syntax is specified as
placeholders for future extensions. An implementation of this standard
which encounters such extensions, but which does not support them, can
simply ignore them.


2.2   Semantics

This field indicates whether the message was sent with or without
explicit human control.

Note 1: A similar header field is defined in X.420 [4].

Note 2: If a message does not have any Auto-Submitted header, no
assumption SHOULD be made of whether this message was automatically
generated or not.


2.3   Relation to NOTIFY ESMTP command

This standard does not specify handling of Delivery Status
Notifications. Such notifications are requested by the ESTMP NOTIFY
command [7] and DSNs themselves need not contain any auto-submitted
header, since their mode of submission is shown by the DSN format as
defined in the DSN standards [6].


2.4   Examples

2.4.1 Syntax examples without private extensions:

Example 1:   Auto-Submitted: auto-generated

Example 2:   Auto-Submitted: auto-replied

Example 3:   Auto-Submitted: no


2.4.2 Possible syntax examples with private or future extensions:

Example 4:   Auto-Submitted: x-ibm-transaction

Example 5:   Auto-Submitted: auto-replied ; bounced


2.4.3 Auto-Submitted: no or no Auto-Submitted header

In the following cases the "Auto-Submitted: no" header, or no
Auto-Submitted header shall be generated.

>  Ordinary e-mail messages written by a person.

>  A person interacts with a mail-generating client, e.g. instructs
   it to join a mailing list, and the client generates a message to a
   listserver with commands for subscribing to the list.

>  A person interacts with a World Wide Web form, such that the
   filled-in form is automatically sent to an e-mail address
   specified in the WWW form document.


2.4.4 Keep the field in forwarded message

In the following cases, an existing Auto-Submitted header on a
forwarded message SHOULD be kept as it is.

>  A moderator accepts messages to a moderated group, and forwards
   the accepted messages to the group members, possibly merged into
   a digest by software for producing digests.

>  Automatic forwarding by mailing list expanders or to a new
   e-mail address for the recipient.


2.4.5 Auto-Submitted: auto-generated

>  An automatic weather-station sends automatic messages with
   temperature, wind velocity, etc. to a weather data base server.

>  An automatically generated weather-report is sent once every
   three hours to subscribing customers.

>  An automatic computer process sends failure reports.

>  An automatic vote counter counts incoming votes and reports on
   the outcome of the vote.

>  A subscription service sends copies of a file every time the file
   is updated to people subscribing to such updates. If the
   subscription server wants notifications when the subscriber address
   is faulty, it can request them with the NOTIFY ESMTP command.

   Note: This is a borderline case. If the sent files has as SMTP-sender
   the person who modified this file, it should not be regarded as
   auto-submitted.


2.4.6 Auto-Submitted: auto-replied

>  A mail server responds to an incoming request message.

Many uses of this header field is for special kinds of notifications,
such as:

>  A notification asking you to confirm your subscription to a mailing
   list, which is sent to you automatically by the mailing-list-server
   every six month.

>  A vacation server sends a vacation notification in response to an
   incoming message for the person who is on vacation.

>  A notification that a message, after receipt, has been purged,
   forwarded or handled in some other special way.


3.    Supersedes

Syntax: supersedes-field = "Supersedes" ":" 1*msg-id

The message identifiers (msg-id) use the msg-id format, as defined in
RFC 822 [1].

Note that there is no comma between multiple values, and that each
Message-ID value is to be surrounded by angle brackets.

The Supersedes header identifies previous correspondence, which this
message supersedes. A user agent is expected to handle this field in
much the same way as the In-Reply-To and References header.

(a) Thus, this header does not imply any mandatory deletion of the
previous correspondence.

(b) User agents which provide user commands for getting from a reply to
the replied-to message (or for getting from a replied-to message to its
replies), MAY provide similar commands for getting from a superseding
message to the superseded message (or for getting from a superseded
message to its superseding version).

(c) User agents MAY normally show the recipient both the previous and
the superseding message. If, however, both the previous and the
superseding message have arrived, both having the same author, but the
user has not yet seen either of them, a user agent MAY show only the
superseding message, but also show the supersedes-field to inform the
recipient that this message supersedes a previous message.

(d) User agents might issue a warning if a superseding message arrives
with a different author than the author of the superseded message. This
can be done by checking the "From:" header, or, if PEM [9], PGP [10] or
MOSS [11] signatures are available, by checking the digital signature.

The above procedure is called a "soft supersedes".

Some user agents or servers may delete the old version of a message when
a new version arrives, which is called a "hard supersedes". Hard
supersedes is NOT RECOMMENDED practice, but common, especially in
netnews where servers want to save disk space.

When this is written (1997) some netnews softwares (servers and clients)
cannot handle Supersedes with more than one previous articles listed as
parameters. They usually ignore the Supersedes header in this case, and
treats the new article as a separate article, not related to the
superseded article. Implementors of netnews softwares SHOULD modify
their software to be able to handle Supersedes with more than one
previous article as parameter, but for some time, many softwares may not
be able to handle Supersedes with more than one parameter. A gateway
from e-mail to news MAY because of this delete all but the first
parameter of this attribute when conveying messages from e-mail to news,
BUT such a practice should be temporary only for one or two years until
news softwares have been modified.

Warning: This header MUST be spelled "Supersedes" and not "Supercedes".
Mailers MUST never generate "Supercedes" but MAY accept "Supercedes" in
input.

Note: The Message-ID of a superseding message MUST be different from the
Message-ID of the superseded message. The Message-ID of the superseded
message is used as value in the "Supersedes:" header, not in the
Message-ID of the superseding message.


4.    Expires:

Syntax: Expires-field = "Expires" ":" date-time

The Expires header indicates a date-time, at which this message expires.
The field can be used both to limit and to extend the life of a message.
User agents and servers which employ automatic purging of old messages
MAY let this field influence the purging process. There is no
requirement that a user agent must suppress expired messages or make
them inaccessible to their owners.

Note: This header is also defined, with similar meaning, in netnews [8]
and in X.420 [4].


5.    Relation to X.400 gateways versus Netnews

Similar headers to Supersedes and Expires are also defined in
recommendations for gatewaying [2] between X.400 [4] and Internet mail.
However, those recommendations are only valid for gateways. By defining
the fields here, the fields are made available for general Internet
e-mail usage. This document also gives fuller descriptions of the fields
than is given by the X.400 gatewaying recommendations [2]. Also an
Auto-Submitted feature has recently been added to X.400, with similar
definition as in this document.

Unfortunately, the two new headers Supersedes and Expires have different
names in  Internet-X.400 gatewaying standards [2] and in netnews.

RFC 1327 [2] gives the name "Obsoletes:" for what in netnews is usually
called "Supersedes:" (not specified in RFC 1036 [8] but in common
usage).

RFC 1327 gives the name "Expiry-Date:" for what in netnews is called
"Expires:" (as specified in RFC 1036).

Because compatibility with netnews is more important than with X.400,
the netnews names of these two fields are proposed here.

Future versions of RFC 1327 (the MIXER document) may choose to specify
the use of "Supersedes" and "Expires" also in gatewayed messages from
X.400.


6.    Security considerations

6.1   "Auto-Submitted" security considerations

"Auto-submitted:" raises no new security concerns, instead, it reduces
the risk to security of certain kinds of loops.


6.2   "Supersedes" security considerations

If a mail or news server or receiving user agent suppresses showing of
superseded messages, the "Supersedes:" feature might be used maliciously
to suppress messages written by other people. To reduce the risk for
this, it is RECOMMENDED that user agents give a warning to the recipient
when a superseding message has a different "From:" name than the
superseded message.

A moderately clever forger can of course circumvent this by sending
messages with falsified "From:" field and even falsified SMTP senders.
User agents supporting PEM [9] or PGP [10] can require and check digital
signatures to reduce also this risk.

Another possible risk with "Supersedes:" is that it allows people to
"change their minds", possibly changing the meaning of replies to them.
Example: A message with the text "Do you like your mother" gets the
reply "Yes, very much", and then the original message might be changed
to "Do you like Hitler", changing the meaning of the reply. Note,
however, that the "In-Reply-To" or "References" headers in the reply
refers to the Message-ID of the original message, not of the superseding
message. Thus, a user agent can avoid this problem by designing the user
interface so that replies are not shown as referring to the superseding
message, when they use the Message-ID of the superseded message.

Also, since "Supersedes:" in e-mail does not actually cause deletion of
the superseded message, recipients can look up the superseded message to
see if the author has changed his mind. In general, it is not illegal or
unethical to change your mind, rather, it shows your openness to new
ideas and willingness to listen to the arguments of other people.

The fact that Supersedes in e-mail does not enforce deletion of the
supersedes message, but that Supersedes in many existing netnews
implementations does enforce such deletion, may in some circumstances
cause security problems.


6.3   "Expires" security considerations

One intention of "Expires" is to help recipients avoid seeing messages
with information which is not any longer valid. There may of course be
cases where a user might want to see an expired message (e.g. a user
might sometimes want to be informed of a meeting, even after the time of
the meeting). This could possibly be solved by having different kinds of
"Expires" for different expiration causes, however, this complexity is
not felt needed at present. A user agent can of course be designed to
inform the recipient also of expired messages, and allow the recipient
the choice of reading them or not. This standard does, therefore, not
require user agents to make expired messages inaccessible.
