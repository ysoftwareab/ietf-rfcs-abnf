Abstract

   A Mobile IPv6 node requires a home agent address, a home address, and
   IPsec security association with its home agent before it can start
   utilizing Mobile IPv6 service.  RFC 3775 requires that some or all of
   these parameters are statically configured.  Ongoing work aims to
   make this information dynamically available to the mobile node.  An
   important aspect of the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping solution is to
   support interworking with existing authentication, authorization and
   accounting infrastructure.  This document defines a Diameter

Internet-Draft     Diameter MIPv6 Integrated Scenario      February 2006


1.  Introduction

   Mobile IPv6 specification [1] requires a Mobile Node (MN) to perform
   registration with a Home Agent with information about its current
   point of attachment (Care-of Address).  The Home Agent creates and
   maintains binding between the MN's Home Address and the MN's Care-of
   Address.

   In order to register with a Home Agent, the MN needs to know some
   information such as, the Home Link prefix, the Home Agent Address,
   the Home Address, the Home Link prefix Length and security related
   information in order to later secure the Binding Update.

   The aforementioned set of information may be statically provisioned
   in the MN.  However, static provisioning of this information has its
   drawbacks.  It increases provisioning and network maintenance burden
   for the operator.  Moreover, static provisioning does not allow load
   balancing, failover, opportunistic home link assignment etc.  For
   example, the user may be accessing the network from a location that
   may be geographically far away from the preconfigured home link; the
   administrative burden to configure the MN's with the respective
   addresses is large and the ability to react on environmental changes
   is minimal.  In these situations static provisioning may not be
   desirable.

   Dynamic assignment of Mobile IPv6 home registration information is a
   desirable feature for ease of deployment and network maintenance.
   For this purpose, the Diameter infrastructure, which is used for
   access authentication, can be leveraged to assign some or all of the
   necessary parameters.  The Diameter server in the Access Service
   Provider (ASP) or in the Mobility Service Provider's (MSP) network
   may return these parameters to the AAA client.  The AAA client might
   either be the NAS, in case of the integrated scenario, or the home
   agent, in case of the split scenario.  The terms integrated and split
   are described in the terminology section and were introduced in [2].

2.  Terminology and Abbreviations

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [3].

   General mobility terminology can be found in [4].  The following
   additional terms, as defined in [2], are used in this document:

   Access Service Authorizer (ASA):

      A network operator that authenticates a mobile node and
      establishes the mobile node's authorization to receive Internet
      service.

   Access Service Provider (ASP):

      A network operator that provides direct IP packet forwarding to
      and from the mobile node.

   Mobility Service Authorizer (MSA):

      A service provider that authorizes Mobile IPv6 service.

   Mobility Service Provider (MSP):

      A service provider that provides Mobile IPv6 service.  In order to
      obtain such service, the mobile node must be authenticated and
      authorized to obtain the Mobile IPv6 service.

   Split scenario:

      A scenario where the mobility service and the network access
      service are authorized by different entities.

   Integrated Scenario:

      A scenario where the mobility service and the network access
      service are authorized by the same entity.

3.  Overview

   This document addresses the authentication, authorization and
   accounting functionality required by for the MIPv6 bootstrapping as
   outlined in the MIPv6 bootstrapping problem statement document (see
   [2]).  This document focuses on the AAA functionality for the
   integrated scenario.  The AAA interaction for the split scenario seem
   to be much simpler and described in [10].

   The subsequent text outlines the AAA interaction between the
   participating entities in the integrated scenario.  In the integrated
   scenario MIPv6 bootstrapping is provided as part of the network
   access authentication procedure.  Figure 1 shows the participating
   entities.

   Figure 1: Mobile IPv6 Bootstrapping:     Integrated scenario

   In the typical Mobile IPv6 access scenario as shown above, the MN
   attaches in a Access Service Provider's network.  During this network
   attachment procedure, the NAS/Diameter client interacts with the
   mobile node.  As shown in Figure 1, the authentication and
   authorization happens via a Diameter infrastructure.

   At the time of authorizing the user for IPv6 access, the Diameter
   server in the MSA detects that the user is authorized for Mobile IPv6
   access.  Based on the MSA's policy, the Diameter server may allocate
   several parameters to the MN for use during the subsequent Mobile
   IPv6 protocol interaction with the home agent.

   Depending on the details of the solution interaction with the DHCPv6
   server may be required, as described in [5].

4.  Command Codes and AVPs

   This section defines command codes and AVPs for usage of Diameter for
   bootstrapping MIPv6 in the split scenario.

4.1.  Command Codes

   This document introduces four new command codes:

   o  MIPv6-Bootstrapping-Request (MBR) (Code TBD)

   o  MIPv6-Bootstrapping-Answer (MBA) (Code TBD)

   o  MIPv6-Home-Agent-Request (MHR) (Code TBD)

   o  MIPv6-Home-Agent-Answer (MHA) (Code TBD)

   In addition, the following Diameter Base protocol messages are used
   with this application:


   Command-Name                  Abbrev.        Code      Reference
   Accounting-Request             ACR            271       RFC 3588
   Accounting-Request             ACR            271       RFC 3588
   Accounting-Answer              ACA            271       RFC 3588
   Re-Auth-Request                RAR            258       RFC 3588
   Re-Auth-Answer                 RAA            258       RFC 3588
   Abort-Session-Request          ASR            274       RFC 3588
   Abort-Session-Answer           ASA            274       RFC 3588
   Session-Term-Request           STR            275       RFC 3588
   Session-Term-Answer            STA            275       RFC 3588

4.2.  Advertising Application Support

   Diameter nodes conforming to this specification MAY advertise support
   by including the value of (TBD) in the Auth-Application-Id or the
   Acct-Application-Id AVP of the Capabilities-Exchange-Request and
   Capabilities-Exchange-Answer command [6].

   The value of TBD MUST be used as the Application-Id in all MBR/MBA
   and MHR/MHA commands.

   The value of zero (0) SHOULD be used as the Application-Id in all
   STR/STA, ACR/ACA, ASR/ASA, and RAR/RAA commands, because these
   commands are defined in the Diameter base protocol and no additional
   mandatory AVPs for those commands are defined in this document.

4.3.  MIPv6-Bootstrapping-Request (MBR)

   The MIPv6-Bootstrapping-Request message (MBR) indicated by the
   Command- Code field (see Section 3 of [6]) set to TBD and 'R' bit set
   in the Command Flags field is used by Diameter clients to request
   home agent assignment, to authorize for mobility service usage and
   optionally to indicate the support of local home agent assignment.

   The MBR message MAY carry the DNS Update Mobility Option and the
   MIPv6 Bootstrapping Feature attribute.

   The message format, presented in ABNF form [7], is defined as
   follows:


    <MIPv6-Bootstrapping-Request> ::= < Diameter Header: XXX, REQ, PXY >
                         < Session-Id >
                         { Auth-Application-Id }
                         { Origin-Host }
                         { Origin-Realm }
                         { Destination-Realm }
                         { Auth-Request-Type }

4.4.  MIPv6-Bootstrapping-Answer (MBA)

   The MIPv6-Bootstrapping-Answer (MBA) message, indicated by the
   Command- Code field set to TBD and 'R' bit cleared in the Command
   Flags field is sent in response to the MIPv6-Bootstrapping-Request
   message (MBR).  If the mobility service is successfully authorized
   and the Diameter server was able to fulfill the bootstrapping request
   (if needed) then the response MAY include the DNS Update Mobility
   Option, Home Address, Home Link Prefix, Home Agent FQDN and the Home
   Agent Address AVP.

   The message format is defined as follows:

4.5.  MIPv6-Home-Agent-Request (MHR)

   The MIPv6-Home-Agent-Request (MHR) message, indicated by the Command-
   Code field set to TDB and 'R' bit set in the Command Flags field is
   used by Diameter entity (acting as a Diameter client) to interact
   with the home agent. (acting as a Diameter server).

   The message MUST carry the MIPv6 Security Association Parameters.
   Additionally, the Diameter client might provide the Home Address and
   the Home Link Prefix to the Diameter server.

   The message format is defined as follows:


    <MIPv6-Home-Agent-Request> ::= < Diameter Header: XXX, REQ, PXY >
                              < Session-Id >
                              { Auth-Application-Id }
                              { Origin-Host }
                              { Origin-Realm }
                              { Destination-Realm }
                              { Auth-Request-Type }
                              [ Destination-Host ]
                              [ Home Address ]

4.6.  MIPv6-Home-Agent-Answer (MHA)

   The MIPv6-Home-Agent-Answer (MHA) message, indicated by the Command-
   Code field set to TBD and 'R' bit cleared in the Command Flags field
   is sent in response to the MIPv6-Home-Agent-Request (MHR) message for
   confirmation of the result of MIPv6 HA bootstrapping.  This message
   MAY contain the Home Link Prefix and the Home Address.

   The message format is defined as follows:


     <MIPv6-Home-Agent-Answer (MHA)> ::= < Diameter Header: XXX, PXY >
                              < Session-Id >

                           *  [ AVP ]

4.7.  AVPs

4.7.1.  Home Agent Address AVP

   The Diameter server MAY decide to assign a Home Agent to the MN that
   is in close proximity to the point of attachment (e.g., determined by
   the NAS-ID).  There may be other reasons for dynamically assigning
   Home Agents to the MN, for example to share the traffic load.  The
   AVP also contains the prefix length so that the MN can easily infer
   the Home Link prefix from the Home Agent address.

4.7.2.  Home Agent FQDN AVP

   The Diameter server MAY assign an FQDN of the home address to the MN.
   The mobile node can perform DNS query with the FQDN to derive the
   home agent address.

4.7.3.  Home Link Prefix AVP

   For the same reason as the HA assignment, the Diameter server MAY
   assign a Home Link that is in close proximity to the point of
   attachment (NAS-ID).  The MN can perform [1] specific procedures to
   discover other information for Mobile IPv6 registration.

4.7.4.  Home Address AVP

   The Diameter server MAY assign a Home Address to the MN.  This allows
   the network operator to support mobile devices that are not
   configured with static addresses.  The attribute also contains the
   prefix length so that the MN can easily infer the Home Link prefix
   from the Home Agent address.

   server to perform a dynamic DNS update.  When this payload is
   included in the reverse direction, i.e., from the Diameter server to
   the Diameter client, it informs about the status of the dynamic DNS
   update.  When the payload is sent from the Diameter client to the
   Diameter server then the response MUST include the DNS Update
   Mobility Option AVP.

4.7.6.  MIPv6 Bootstrapping Feature Attribute

   By using this payload the Diameter client indicates to the Diameter
   server certain capabilities and features.  For example, the Diameter
   client might want to indicate that local Home Agent assignment can be
   provided.

   Local-Home-Agent-Assignment:

      This flag is set to 1 when the Diameter client knows that a local
      home agent can be provided for the mobile node.  Whether a local
      home agent can be provided depends on the functionality offered by
      the visited network and configured to the Diameter client.

4.7.7.  MIPv6 Security Association Parameters

   This payload is used by the Diameter entity to provision keying
   material in a push fashion to the home agent.  This AVP includes
   keying material, lifetime and key name information.  Security
   parameter bootstrapping can be provided for IKEv2 [8], IKEv1 or for
   the MIPv6-AUTH protocol.

   [Editor's Note: A future version of this document will provide
   detailed AVP formats.]

5.  Example Exchanges

   The following section shows a basic message flow with dynamic Home
   Agent assignment in the user's home network.  The MBR / MBA message
   exchange illustrates the communication between the Diameter client
   and the Diameter server to initiate the bootstrapping procedure.  The
   interaction between the Home Diameter server and the Home Agent (for
   HA bootstrapping in the home network) is depicted with the MHR / MHA
   exchange.

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the Diameter interaction required to
   accomplish the integrated scenario are described in [5] .
   Additionally, the security consideratios of the Diameter base
   protocol [6], Diameter NASREQ [11] / Diameter EAP [12] (with respect
   to network access authentication and the transport of keying
   material) are applicable to this document.

9.  Open Issues

   A number of open issues have been identified during the work on this
   document.  This document is incomplete since the AAA interaction for
   MIPv6 bootstrapping is still at an early stage.  The following
   aspects require further discussion:

   o  The details of the Diameter bootstrapping with respect to
      security.

   o  AVP formats are not yet provided and a table of occurance is
      missing.

   o  The IANA consideration section is empty.

   o  Diameter Client/Server Behavior needs to be specified explicitly.

   o  More examples are useful.

   o  Alignment with the ongoing RADIUS MIPv6 bootstrapping needs to be
      ensured.
