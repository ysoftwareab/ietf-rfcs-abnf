RDMA_MSG = 0         indicates that chunk lists and a Payload stream
                        follow.  The format of the chunk lists is
                        discussed below.

RDMA_NOMSG = 1       indicates that after the chunk lists there is no
                        Payload stream.  In this case, the chunk lists
                        provide information to allow the Responder to
                        transfer the Payload stream using explicit RDMA
                        operations.

RDMA_MSGP = 2        is reserved.

RDMA_DONE = 3        is reserved.

RDMA_ERROR = 4       is used to signal an encoding error in the RPC-
                        over-RDMA header.
