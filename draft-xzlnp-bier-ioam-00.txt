  Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) Encapsulation for In-situ OAM
                              (IOAM) Data
                        draft-xzlnp-bier-ioam-00

Abstract

   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) collects
   operational and telemetry information while the packet traverses a
   particular network domain.  Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is
   an architecture that provides optimal multicast forwarding through a
   "multicast domain", without requiring intermediate routers to
   maintain any per-flow state or to engage in an explicit tree-building
   protocol.  The BIER header contains a bit-string in which each bit
   represents exactly one egress router to forward the packet to.  This
   document outlines the requirements to carry IOAM data in BIER header
   and specifies how IOAM data fields are encapsulated in BIER header.

1.  Introduction

   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) collects
   operational and telemetry information while the packet traverses a
   particular network domain.  [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] defines
   different IOAM data fields used to record various telemetry data from
   the transit nodes.  The term "in-situ" refers to the fact that the
   IOAM data fields are added to the data packets rather than being sent
   within packets specifically dedicated to OAM.

   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER), as defined in [RFC8279], is an
   architecture that provides optimal multicast forwarding through a
   "multicast domain", without requiring intermediate routers to
   maintain any per-flow state or to engage in an explicit tree-building

   protocol.  The BIER header, as defined in [RFC8296], contains a bit-
   string in which each bit represents exactly one egress router to
   forward the packet to.

   This document outlines the requirements to carry IOAM data in BIER
   header and specifies how IOAM data fields are encapsulated in BIER
   header.

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Requirements to carry IOAM data in BIER header

   [I-D.ietf-bier-use-cases] lists many use cases for BIER.  There are
   many multicast flows in one network.  Some of the flows are sensitive
   for packet loss, delay and other factors, such as live video, real-
   time meeting.  The network administrator wants to know the real-time
   statistics for these flows, such as delay, sequence, the I/O
   interface, and the usage of buffer, and so on.

   So a method need to be used for measuring the packet real-time
   transportation guarantee.  OAM function defined in
   [I-D.ietf-bier-pmmm-oam] can be used for packet loss and delay
   detection.  This document attempts to provide a way to achieve on-
   path telemetry information collection through in-situ OAM.

4.  IOAM data fields encapsulation in BIER header

   The BIER header is defined in [RFC8279].  The BIER OAM header that
   follows BIER header is defined in [I-D.ietf-bier-ping].  IOAM-Data-
   Fields can either be carried in BIER using a new type of OAM message
   which follows the BIER OAM header (referred to as option 1), or be
   carried in BIER using a new next protocol header which immediately
   follows the BIER header (referred to as option 2).  In this document,
   option 2 is selected and the reason is discussed in Section 5.1.  An
   IOAM header is added containing the different IOAM-Data-Fields
   defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

   In an administrative domain where IOAM is used, insertion of the IOAM
   header in BIER is enabled at the BFIRs, which also serve as IOAM
   encapsulating nodes by means of configuration, deletion of the IOAM
   header in BIER is enabled at the BFERs, which also serve as IOAM
   decapsulating nodes by means of configuration.

   The Encapsulation format for IOAM over BIER is defined as follows:

              Figure 1: IOAM Encapsulation Format within BIER

   The BIER header and fields are defined in [RFC8296].  Within the BIER
   header, a 6-bit field as "Proto" (Next Protocol) is used to identify
   the type of the payload immediately following the BIER header, The
   "Proto" value is set to TBD when the IOAM header is present.

   The IOAM related fields in BIER are defined as follows:

      IOAM-Type: 8-bit field defining the IOAM Option Type, as defined
      in Section 7.2 of [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

      IOAM HDR Len: 8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the IOAM header
      in 4-octet units.

      Reserved: 10-bit reserved field MUST be set to zero upon
      transmission and ignored upon receipt.

Internet-Draft          BIER Encap for IOAM Data               July 2020


      Next Proto: 6-bit unsigned integer that identifies the type of
      payload immediately following this IOAM option.  The semantics of
      this field are identical to the "Proto" field in [RFC8296].

      IOAM Option and Data Space: IOAM option header and data is present
      as specified by the IOAM-Type field, and is defined in Section 4
      of [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

   Multiple IOAM-Option-Types MAY be included within the BIER
   encapsulation.  For example, if a BIER encapsulation contains two
   IOAM-Option-Types preceding a data payload, the Next Proto field of
   the first IOAM option will contain the value of TBD, while the Next
   Proto field of the second IOAM option will contain the "BIER Next
   Protocol" number indicating the type of the data payload.  Each IOAM
   Option-Type MUST occur at most once within the same BIER
   encapsulation header.

5.  Considerations

   This section summarizes a set of considerations on the overall
   approach taken for IOAM data encapsulation in BIER, as well as
   deployment considerations.

5.1.  Discussion of the encapsulation approach

   Both the options described in section 4 are supposed to be feasible,
   nevertheless this document needs to select one as standardized
   encapsulation for IOAM over BIER.  Considering the fact that the
   encapsulation format option 2 using a new next protocol header is
   more concise than option 1 using a new type of OAM message, and many
   other transport protocols, e.g.  GRE, use a new next protocol header
   to encapsulate IOAM data, the encapsulation format option 2 is
   selected as the standardized one.

5.2.  IOAM and the use of the BIER OAM bits

   [RFC8296] defines a two-bits long field, referred to as OAM.
   [I-D.ietf-bier-pmmm-oam] describes how to use the two-bits OAM field
   for alternate marking performance measurement method.  The BIER IOAM
   header and the BIER two-bits OAM field are orthogonal and can co-
   exist in the same packet header, i.e. a BIER packet with IOAM data
   can set the OAM field or not, and a BIER packet with OAM field set
   can also carry IOAM data or not.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not raise any additional security issues beyond
   those of the specifications referred to in the list of normative
   references.

7.  IANA Considerations

   In the "BIER Next Protocol Identifiers" registry defined in
   [RFC8296], a new Next Protocol Value for IOAM is requested from IANA
   as follows:

   +--------------------+---------------+-----------------+------------+
   | BIER Next Protocol | Description   | Semantics       | Reference  |
   | Identifier         |               | Definition      |            |
   +--------------------+---------------+-----------------+------------+
   | TBD                | In-situ OAM   | Section 4       | This       |
   |                    | (IOAM)        |                 | Document   |
