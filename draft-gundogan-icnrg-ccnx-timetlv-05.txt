 Alternative Delta Time Encoding for CCNx Using Compact Floating-Point

                draft-gundogan-icnrg-ccnx-timetlv-05

Abstract

   CCNx utilizes delta time for a number of functions.  When using CCNx
   in environments with constrained nodes and/or bandwidth constrained
   networks, it is valuable to have a compressed representation of delta
   time.  In order to do so, either accuracy or dynamic range has to be
   sacrificed.  Since the current uses of delta time do not require both
   simultaneously, one can consider a logarithmic encoding such as that
   specified in [IEEE.754.2019].  This document updates _CCNx messages
   in TLV Format_ (RFC8609) to specify this alternative encoding.

1.  Introduction

   CCNx utilizes time values for a number of functions.  Some of these
   are expressed as absolute time, others as delta time.  When using
   CCNx in environments with constrained nodes and/or bandwidth
   constrained networks, it is valuable to have a compact representation
   of time values.  For example [RFC9139] specifies a compression scheme
   useful over IEEE 802.15.4 networks.  However, any compact time
   representation has to sacrifice either accuracy or dynamic range or
   both.  For some time uses this is relatively straightforward to
   achieve, for other uses, it is not.  This document discusses the
   various cases, and proposes a compact encoding that is easily
   accommodated for delta times.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft              TimeTLV for CCNx                January 2022


   This document uses the terminology of [RFC8569] and [RFC8609] for
   CCNx entities.

   The following terms are used in the document and defined as follows:

   byte:         synonym for octet

   time value:   a time offset measured in seconds

   time code:    an 8-bit encoded time value

3.  Usage of Time Values in CCNx

3.1.  Relative Time in CCNx

   CCNx, as currently specified in [RFC8569], utilizes delta time for
   only the lifetime of an Interest message (see sections 2.1, 2.2,
   2.4.2, 10.3 of [RFC8569]).  It is a hop-by-hop header value, and is
   currently encoded via the T_INTLIFE TLV as a 64-bit integer
   ([RFC8609] section 3.4.1).  While formally an optional TLV, in all
   but some corner cases every Interest message is expected to carry the
   Interest Lifetime TLV, and hence having compact encoding is
   particularly valuable for keeping Interest messages short.

   Since the current uses of delta time do not require both accuracy and
   dynamic range simultaneously, one can consider a logarithmic encoding
   such as that specified in [IEEE.754.2019] and outlined in Section 4.
   This document updates CCNx messages in TLV Format ([RFC8609]) to
   permit this alternative encoding for selected time values.  See
   Section 6 for the specific actions needed to register this
   alternative compact representation of Interest Lifetime.

3.2.  Absolute Time in CCNx

   CCNx, as currently specified in [RFC8569], utilizes absolute time for
   various important functions.  Each of these absolute time usages
   poses a different challenge for a compact representation.  These are
   discussed in the following subsections.

3.2.1.  Signature Time and Expiry Time

   _Signature Time_ is the time the signature of a content object was
   generated (sections 8.2-8.4 [RFC8569]).  _Expiry Time_ indicates the
   expiry time of a content object (section 4 [RFC8569]).  Both values
   are content message TLVs and represent absolute timestamps in
   milliseconds since the UTC epoch (i.e., an NTP timestamp).  They are
   currently encoded via the T_SIGTIME and T_EXPIRY TLVs as 64-bit
   unsigned integers (see section 3.6.4.1.4.5 [RFC8609] and section



Gundogan, et al.          Expires 25 July 2022                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft              TimeTLV for CCNx                January 2022


   3.6.2.2.2 [RFC8609]).

   Both time values could be in the past, or in the future, potentially
   by a large delta.  They are also included in the security envelope of
   the message.  Therefore, it seems there is no practical way to define
   an alternative compact encoding that preserves its semantics and
   security properties; hence we don't consider it further as a
   candidate.

3.2.2.  Recommended Cache Time

   _Recommended Cache Time_ (RCT) for a content object (see section 4
   [RFC8569]) is a hop-by-hop header stating the expiration time for a
   cached content object in milliseconds since the UTC epoch (i.e., an
   NTP timestamp).  It is currently encoded via the T_CACHETIME TLV as a
   64-bit unsigned integer (see section 3.4.2 [RFC8609]).

   A recommended cache time could be far in the future, but cannot be in
   the past and is likely to be a reasonably short offset from the
   current time.  Therefore, this document allows the recommended cache
   time to be interpreted as a relative time value rather than an
   absolute time, since the semantics associated with an absolute time
   value do not seem to be critical to the utility of this value.  This
   document therefore updates the recommended cache time with the
   following rule set:

   *  Use absolute time as per [RFC8609]

   *  Use relative time, if the compact time representation is used (see
      Section 4 and Section 5)

4.  A Compact Time Representation with Logarithmic Range

   This document uses the compact time representation of ICNLoWPAN (see
   section 7 of [RFC9139]) that is inspired by [RFC5497] and
   [IEEE.754.2019].  Its logarithmic encoding supports a representation
   ranging from milliseconds to years.  Figure 1 depicts the logarithmic
   nature of this time representation.

    || |  |   |    |     |      |       |        |         |          |
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
    milliseconds                                                  years

       Figure 1: A logarithmic range representation allows for higher
       precision in the smaller time ranges and still supports large
                                time deltas.

   Time codes encode exponent and mantissa values in a single byte, but
   in contrast to the representation in [IEEE.754.2019], time codes only
   encode positive numbers and hence do not include an extra sign bit.
   Figure 2 shows the configuration of a time code: an exponent width of
   5 bits, and a mantissa width of 3 bits.

                 <---          one byte wide          --->
                 +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
                 |      exponent (b)      | mantissa (a) |
                 +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
                   0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7

        Figure 2: A time code with exponent and mantissa to encode a
                   logarithmic range time representation.

   The base unit for time values are seconds.  A time value is
   calculated using the following formula (adopted from [RFC5497] and
   [RFC9139]), where (a) represents the mantissa, (b) the exponent, and
   (C) a constant factor set to C := 1/32.

   Subnormal (b == 0):  (0 + a/8) * 2 * C

   Normalized (b > 0):  (1 + a/8) * 2^b * C

   The subnormal form provides a gradual underflow between zero and the
   smallest normalized number.  Eight time values exist in the subnormal
   range [0s,~0.054688s] with a step size of ~0.007812s between each
   time value.  This configuration also encodes the following convenient
   numbers in seconds: [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, ...].  Appendix A
   further includes test vectors to illustrate the logarithmic range.

   An example algorithm to encode a time value into the corresponding
   exponent and mantissa is given as pseudo code in Figure 3.  Not all
   time values can be represented by a time code.  For these instances,
   the closest time code is chosen that is smaller than the value to
   encode.

      input: float v    // time value
     output:   int a, b // mantissa, exponent of time code

     (a, b) encode (v):

         if (v == 0)
             return (0, 0)

         if (v < 2 * C)                              // subnormal
             a = floor (v * 4 / C)                   // round down
             return (a, 0)
         else                                        // normalized
             if (v > (1 + 7/8) * 2^31 * C)           // check bounds
                 return (7, 31)                      // return maximum
             else
                 b = floor (log2(v / C))             // round down
                 a = floor ((v / (2^b * C) - 1) * 8) // round down
                 return (a, b)

                    Figure 3: Algorithm in pseudo code.

   As an example: No specific time code for 0.063 exists, but this
   algorithm maps to the closest valid time code that is smaller, i.e.,
   exponent 1 and mantissa 0 (the same as for time value 0.0625).

5.  Protocol Integration of the Compact Time Representation

   A straightforward way to accommodate the compact time approach is to
   use a 1-byte length field to indicate this alternative encoding while
   retaining the existing TLV registry entries.  This approach has
   backward compatibility problems, but may still be considered for the
   following reasons:

   *  Both CCNx RFCs are experimental and not Standards Track, hence
      expectations for forward and backward compatibility are not as
      stringent.  "Flag day" upgrades of deployed CCNx networks, while
      inconvenient, are still feasible.

   *  The major use case for these compressed encodings are smaller-
      scale IoT and/or sensor networks where the population of
      consumers, producers, and forwarders is reasonably small.

   *  Since the current TLVs have hop-by-hop semantics, they are not
      covered by any signed hash and hence may be freely re-encoded by
      any forwarder.  That means a forwarder supporting the new encoding
      can translate freely between the two encodings.

Internet-Draft              TimeTLV for CCNx                January 2022


   *  The alternative of assigning new TLV registry values does not
      substantially mitigate the interoperability problems anyway.

   The following lists alternative approaches of integrating the compact
   time representation for time offsets in CCNx messages.  A further
   analysis, discussion, and decision on the best suited approach will
   be added as the document progresses.

   1.  Relative time TLVs (e.g., T_INTLIFETIME) include nested TLVs to
       hint at the used encoding.  This approach is the least intrusive
       integration, but adds a TLV overhead that negates the benefits of
       the compact time representation.

   2.  A new TLV type for T_INTLIFETIME with a compact time
       representation (T_INTLIFETIME_COMPACT) is defined.  The packet
       header grammar from [RFC8609] is updated to allow for
       T_INTLIFETIME_COMPACT at the same level of the currently defined
       T_INTLIFETIME with an exclusive or.

5.1.  Interest Lifetime

   The Interest Lifetime definition in [RFC8609] allows for a variable-
   length lifetime representation, where a length of 1 encodes the
   linear range [0,255] in milliseconds.  This document changes the
   definition to always encode 1-byte Interest lifetime values in the
   compact time value representation (Figure 4).

5.2.  Recommended Cache Time

   The Recommended Cache Time definition in [RFC8609] specifies an
   absolute time representation that is of a length fixed to 8 bytes.
   This document changes the definition to always encode 1-byte
   Recommended Cache Time values in the compact relative time value
   representation (Figure 5).

   The packet processing is adapted to calculate an absolute time from
   the relative time code based on the absolute reception time.  On
   transmission, a new relative time code is calculated based on the
   current system time.

6.  IANA Considerations

   Based on the approach of integration, certain TLV registries from
   [RFC8609] need to be updated.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document makes no semantic changes to [RFC8569], nor to any of
   the security properties of the message encodings of [RFC8609], and
   hence has the same security considerations as those two existing
   documents.
