Internet-Draft                   PIM MIB                    October 2005


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the
   Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) protocols (PIM-SM [I-D.ietf-pim-
   sm-v2-new] and BIDIR-PIM [I-D.ietf-pim-bidir]).

   This document is part of work in progress to obsolete RFC 2934
   [RFC2934].  RFC 2934 defined an experimental MIB module for managing
   the PIM protocols.  The MIB module defined by this document is a re-
   working of the MIB module from RFC 2934, with major changes that
   include the following.

   o  This MIB module is independent of IP version, whereas RFC 2934
      only supported IPv4.

   o  This MIB module includes support for managing BIDIR-PIM.

   o  This MIB module does not include support for managing PIM-DM.

   o  This MIB module does not include support for managing PIM-SM v1.

   o  This MIB module does not depend on the IPv4 Multicast Routing MIB
      defined in RFC 2932 [RFC2932].

   o  This MIB module includes support for configuring static RPs.

   o  This MIB module includes support for configuring anycast RPs
      [I-D.ietf-pim-anycast-rp]>.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580

   [RFC2580].

3.  Overview

   This MIB module contains the following tables.

   1.   The PIM Interface Table, which contains one row per IP version
        for each interface of the router which is running PIM.

   2.   The PIM Neighbor Table, which contains one row for each of the
        router's PIM neighbors.

   3.   The PIM Neighbor Secondary Address Table, which contains one row
        for each secondary address advertised by each of the router's
        PIM neighbors.

   4.   The PIM (*,G) State Table, which contains one row for each group
        for which PIM has (*,G) state.

   5.   The PIM (*,G,I) State Table, which contains one row for each
        group and interface for which PIM has interface-specific (*,G)
        state.

   6.   The PIM (S,G) State Table, which contains one row for each
        source and group for which PIM has (S,G) state.

   7.   The PIM (S,G,I) State Table, which contains one row for each
        source, group and interface for which PIM has interface-specific
        (S,G) state.

   8.   The PIM (S,G,rpt) State Table, which contains one row for each
        source and group for which PIM has (S,G,rpt) state.

   9.   The PIM (S,G,rpt,I) State Table, which contains one row for each
        source, group and interface for which PIM has interface-specific
        (S,G,rpt) state.

   10.  The PIM Bidir DF-Election Table, which contains one row per
        interface for each Rendezvous Point (RP) for which
        Bidirectional-PIM Designated Forwarder (DF) election state is
        maintained.

   11.  The PIM Static RP Table, which contains one row per range of
        multicast group addresses for which a particular configured RP
        should be used.

   12.  The PIM Group Mapping Table, which contains one row for each
        mapping from a multicast group address prefix to the PIM mode

        and RP address to use for groups within that group prefix,
        regardless of the source of the group mapping information.

   13.  The PIM Anycast-RP Set Table, which contains one row for each RP
        within each Anycast-RP set of which the local router is a
        member.

   This MIB module uses textual conventions defined in the IF-MIB
   [RFC2863], the INET-ADDRESS-MIB [RFC4001] and the IANA-RTPROTO-MIB.

            the local router.  Note that if using static RP

               created automatically by the router at startup, to
               correspond to the well-defined prefixes of link-local and
               unroutable group addresses.  These rows are never
               destroyed.

            -  Rows with a pimGroupMappingOrigin value of 'embedded' are
               created by the router to correspond to group prefixes
               that are to be treated as being in Embedded-RP format.

            -  Rows with a pimGroupMappingOrigin value of 'configRp' are
               created and destroyed as a result of rows in the
               pimStaticRPTable being created and destroyed.

            -  Rows with a pimGroupMappingOrigin value of 'configSsm'
               are created and destroyed as a result of configuration of
               SSM address ranges to the local router.

            -  Rows with a pimGroupMappingOrigin value of 'bsr' are
               created as a result of running the PIM Bootstrap Router
               (BSR) mechanism.  If the local router is not the elected
               BSR, these rows are created to correspond to group
               prefixes in the PIM Bootstrap messages received from the
               elected BSR.  If the local router is the elected BSR,
               these rows are created to correspond to group prefixes in
               the PIM Bootstrap messages that the local router sends.
               In either case, these rows are destroyed when the group
               prefixes are timed out by the BSR mechanism.

            -  Rows with a pimGroupMappingOrigin value of 'other' are
               created and destroyed according to some other mechanism
               not specified here.

            Given the collection of rows in this table at any point in
            time, the PIM mode and RP address to use for a particular
            group is determined using the following algorithm.

            1. From the set of all rows, the subset whose group prefix
               contains the group in question are selected.

            2. If there are no such rows, the behavior is undefined.

            3. If there is at least one such row, from the selected
               subset of rows, the subset that have the lowest value
               of pimGroupMappingPrecedence are selected.

            4. From the selected subset of rows, the subset that have
               the greatest value of pimGroupMappingGrpPrefixLength are
               selected.

            5. If there are multiple selected rows, the subset that have
               the highest precedence (the lowest numerical value for
               pimGroupMappingPrecedence) are selected.

            6. If there are multiple selected rows, the row selected is
               implementation dependent; the implementation might or
               might not apply the PIM hash function to select the row.

            7. The group mode to use is given by the value of
               pimGroupMappingPimMode from the single selected row; the
               RP to use is given by the value of

            different Group to RP mappings.

            This trap may also signify that this router believes the

            of the Register has implied ASM usage by sending this

            If the local router has no Group to RP mapping for this

            This trap may indicate a transient condition while new RP

            occurs repeatedly over an extended period, then there is a
            persisting configuration error that requires correction.

            The effect is that multicast data is being discarded,
            because this router discards the unexpected Register
            messages.  The discarded data is from a source directly
            connected to pimUnexpectedRegisterOrigin, and is addressed
            to pimUnexpectedRegisterGroup.

            The condition that causes this trap can occur very
            frequently.  Routers may choose to limit the rate at which

            If the local router has no Group to RP mapping for this
            group, them the object pimGroupMappingPimMode is absent.

            If the neighbor that sent this Join/Prune is known, then
            it is identified by pimNeighborUpTime.  Otherwise
            pimNeighborUpTime is absent.

            This trap may indicate a transient condition while new RP
            mappings are propagating through the network.  If it
            occurs repeatedly over an extended period, then there is a
            persisting configuration error that requires correction.

            The effect is that ASM multicast data will not reach
            listeners below the neighbor identified by pimNeighborUpTime
            because this router will ignore the Join/Prune request.

            The condition that causes this trap can occur very
            frequently.  Routers may choose to limit the rate at which
            pimUnexpectedJoinPrune is sent."

5.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   The following tables and objects could be employed to modify
   multicast routing behavior in a way that prevents or disrupts
   services provided by the network, including (but not limited to)
   multicast data traffic delivery.

   The following tables and objects may also be used to modify multicast
   routing behavior in order to intercept or subvert any information
   that is carried by the network.  For example, attacks can be
   envisaged that would pass nominated multicast data streams through a
   nominated location, without the sources or listeners becoming aware
   of this subversion.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   The following tables and objects could be employed to determine the
   topology, disposition, and composition of the network.  This
   information may be commercially sensitive, and may also be used in
   preparation for attacks, including any of the attacks described
   above.

   The following tables and objects may also be used to determine
   whether multicast data is flowing in the network, or has flowed
   recently.  They may also be used to determine the network location of
   senders and recipients.  An attacker can apply 'traffic analysis' to
   this data.  In some cases, the information revealed by traffic
   analyses can be as damaging as full knowledge of the data being
   transported.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

6.  IANA Considerations

   PIM-STD-MIB should be rooted under the mib-2 subtree.  IANA is
   requested to assign { mib-2 XXX } to the PIM-STD-MIB module specified
   in this document.

7.  Acknowledgements

   This MIB module is based on the original work in RFC 2934 [RFC2934]
   by K. McCloghrie, D. Farinacci, D. Thaler and W. Fenner and has been
   updated based on feedback from the IETF's Protocol Independent
   Multicast (PIM) Working Group.

   Jonathan Nicholas was the editor of early versions of this document.
