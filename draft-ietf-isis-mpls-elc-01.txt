             Signaling Entropy Label Capability Using IS-IS
                      draft-ietf-isis-mpls-elc-01

Abstract

   Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) has defined a mechanism to load
   balance traffic flows using Entropy Labels (EL).  An ingress LSR
   cannot insert ELs for packets going into a given tunnel unless an
   egress LSR has indicated that it can process ELs for that tunnel.
   This draft defines a mechanism to signal that capability using IS-IS.
   This mechanism is useful when the label advertisement is also done
   via IS-IS.

1.  Introduction

   Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) has defined a method in
   [RFC6790] to load balance traffic flows using Entropy Labels (EL).
   An ingress LSR cannot insert ELs for packets going into a given
   tunnel unless an egress LSR has indicated that it can process ELs for
   that tunnel.  [RFC6790] defines the signaling of this capability
   (a.k.a Entropy Label Capability - ELC) via signaling protocols.
   Recently, mechanisms are being defined to signal labels via link
   state Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP) such as IS-IS
   [I-D.ietf-isis-segment-routing-extensions].  In such scenario the
   signaling mechanisms defined in [RFC6790] are inadequate.  This draft
   defines a mechanism to signal the ELC using IS-IS.  This mechanism is
   useful when the label advertisement is also done via IS-IS.  In
   addition, in the cases where stacked LSPs are used for whatever
   reasons (e.g., SPRING-MPLS [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-mpls]),
   it would be useful for ingress LSRs to know each LSR's capability of
   reading the maximum label stack deepth.  This capability, referred to
   as Readable Label Deepth Capability (RLDC) can be used by ingress
   LSRs to determine whether it's necessary to insert an EL for a given
   LSP tunnel in the case where there has already been at least one EL
   in the label stack [I-D.ietf-mpls-spring-entropy-label] . Of course,
   even it has been determined that it's neccessary to insert an EL for

   a given LSP tunnel, if the egress LSR of that LSP tunnel has not yet
   indicated that it can process ELs for that tunnel, the ingress LSR
   MUST NOT include an entropy label for that tunnel as well.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC6790] and [RFC4971].

3.  Advertising ELC using IS-IS

   The IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV defined in [RFC4971] is used by IS-IS
   routers to announce their capabilities.  A new sub-TLV of this TLV,
   called ELC sub-TLV is defined to advertise the capability of the
   router to process the ELs.  It is formatted as described in [RFC5305]
   with a Type code to be assigned by IANA and a Length of zero.  The
   scope of the advertisement depends on the application but it is
   RECOMMENDED that it SHOULD be domain-wide.  If a router has multiple
   linecards, the router MUST NOT advertise the ELC unless all of the
   linecards are capable of processing ELs.

4.  Advertising RLDC using IS-IS

   A new sub-TLV of the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV, called RLDC sub-TLV
   is defined to advertise the capability of the router to read the
   maximum label stack depth.  It is formatted as described in [RFC5305]
   with a Type code to be assigned by IANA and a Length of one.  The
   Value field is set to the maximum readable label stack deepth in the
   range between 1 to 255.  The scope of the advertisement depends on
   the application but it is RECOMMENDED that it SHOULD be domain-wide.
   If a router has multiple linecards with different capabilities of
   reading the maximum label stack deepth, the router MUST advertise the
   smallest one in the RLDC sub-TLV.

5.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank Yimin Shen and George Swallow for
   their valuable comments on the draft.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes a request to IANA to allocate two sub-TLV types
   within the IS-IS Router Capability TLV.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security risk.
