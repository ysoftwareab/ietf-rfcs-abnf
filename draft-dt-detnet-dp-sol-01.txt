1.  Introduction

   Deterministic Networking (DetNet) is a service that can be offered by
   a network to DetNet flows.  DetNet provides these flows extremely low
   packet loss rates and assured maximum end-to-end delivery latency.
   General background and concepts of DetNet can be found in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture].

   This document specifies the DetNet data plane.  It defines how DetNet
   traffic is encapsulated at the network layer, and how DetNet-aware
   nodes can identity DetNet flows.  Two data plane definitions are
   given.

   o  PW-based: One solution is based on PseudoWires (PW) [RFC3985] and
      makes use of multi-segment pseudowires (MS-PW) [RFC6073] to map
      DetNet Relay and Edge Nodes [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture]
      [I-D.ietf-detnet-dp-alt] to PW architecture.  The PW-based data
      plane can be run over an MPLS [RFC4448] [RFC6658] Packet Switched
      Network (PSN).

   o  Native-IP: The other solution is based on IP header fields, namely
      on the IPv6 Flow Label and a new DetNet Control Word extension
      header option.  It is targeted for native IPv6 networks.

   It is worth noting that while PWs are designed to work over IP PSNs
   this document describes a native-IP solution that operates without
   PWs.  The primary reason for this is the benefit gained by enabling
   the use of a normal application stack, where transport protocols such
   as TCP or UDP are directly encapsulated in IP.

   This document specifies the encapsulation for DetNet flows, including
   a DetNet Control Word (CW).  Furthermore, it describes how DetNet
   flows are identified, how DetNet Relay and Edge nodes work, and how
   the Packet Replication and Elimination function (PREF) is implemented

   with these two data plane solutions.  This document does not define
   the associated control plane functions, or Operations,
   Administration, and Maintenance (OAM).  It also does not specify
   traffic handling capabilities required to deliver congestion
   protection and latency control to DetNet flows as this is defined to
   be provided by the underlying MPLS or IP network.

2.  Terminology

2.1.  Terms used in this document

   This document uses the terminology established in the DetNet
   architecture [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture] and the DetNet Data Plane
   Solution Alternatives [I-D.ietf-detnet-dp-alt].

   The following terms are also used in this document:

   DA-T-PE       MPLS based DetNet edge node: a DetNet-aware PseudoWire
                 Terminating Provider Edge (T-PE).

   DA-S-PE       MPLS based DetNet relay node: a DetNet-aware PseudoWire
                 Switching Provider Edge (S-PE).

   T-Label       A label used to identify the LSP used to transport a
                 DetNet flow across an MPLS PSN, e.g., a hop-by-hop
                 label used between label switching routers (LSR).

   S-Label       A DetNet node to DetNet node "service" label that is
                 used between DA-*-PE devices.

   PW Label      A PseudoWire label that is used to identify DetNet flow
                 related PW Instances within a PE node.

   Flow Label    IPv6 header field that is used to identify a DetNet
                 flow (together with the source IP address field).

   local-ID      An edge and relay node internal construct that uniquely
                 identifies a DetNet flow.  It may be used to select
                 proper forwarding and/or DetNet specific service
                 function.

   PREF          A Packet Replication and Elimination Function (PREF)
                 does the replication and elimination processing of
                 DetNet flow packets in edge or relay nodes.  The
                 replication function is essentially the existing 1+1
                 protection mechanism.  The elimination function reuses
                 and extends the existing duplicate detection mechanism

                 to operate over multiple (separate) DetNet member flows
                 of a DetNet compound flow.

4.  DetNet data plane overview

   This document describes how to use IP and/or MPLS to support a data
   plane method of flow identification and packet formwarding over
   layer-3.  Two different cases are covered: (i) the inter-connect
   scenario, in which IEEE802.1 TSN is routed over a layer-3 network
   (i.e., to enlarge the layer-2 domain), and (ii) native connectivity
   between DetNet-aware end systems.  Figure 1 illustrates an exemplary
   scenario.

   Figure 2 illustrates how DetNet can provide services for IEEE
   802.1TSN end systems over a DetNet enabled network.  The edge nodes
   insert and remove required DetNet data plane encapsulation.  The 'X'
   in the edge and relay nodes represents a potential DetNet flow packet
   replication and elimination point.  This conceptually parallels L2VPN
   services, and could leverage existing related solutions as discussed
   below.

                    Figure 2: IEEE 802.1TSN over DetNet

   Figure 3 illustrates how end to end PW-based DetNet service can be
   provided.  In this case, the end systems are able to send and receive
   DetNet flows.  For example, an end system sends data encapsulated in
   PseudoWire (PW) and in MPLS.  Like earlier the 'X' in the end
   systems, edge and relay nodes represents potential DetNet flow packet
   replication and elimination points.  Here the relay nodes may change
   the underlying transport, for example tunneling IP over MPLS, or
   simply interconnect network segments.

4.1.  DetNet data plane encapsulation requirements

   Two major groups of scenarios can be distinguished which require flow
   identification during transport:

   1.  DetNet function related scenarios:

       *  Congestion protection and latency control: usage of allocated
          resources (queuing, policing, shaping).

       *  Explicit routes: select/apply the flow specific path.

       *  Service protection: recognize DetNet compound and member flows
          for replication an elimination.

   2.  OAM function related scenarios:

       *  troubleshooting (e.g., identify misbehaving flows, etc.)

       *  recognize flow(s) for analytics (e.g., increase counters,
          etc.)

       *  correlate events with flows (e.g., volume above threshold,
          etc.)

       *  etc.

   Each node (edge, relay and transit) use a local-ID of the DetNet-
   (compound)-flow in order to accomplish its role during transport.

   Recognizing the DetNet flow is more relaxed for edge and relay nodes,
   as they are fully aware of both the DetNet service and transport
   layers.  The primary DetNet role of intermediate transport nodes is
   limited to ensuring congestion protection and latency control for the
   above listed DetNet functions.

   The DetNet data plane allows for the aggregation of DetNet flows,
   e.g., via MPLS hierarchical LSPs, to improved scaling.  When DetNet
   flows are aggregated, transit nodes may have limited ability to
   provide service on per-flow DetNet identifiers.  Therefore,
   identifying each individual DetNet flow on a transit node may not be
   achieved in some network scenarios, but DetNet service can still be
   assured in these scenarios through resource allocation and control.

   On each node dealing with DetNet flows, a local-ID is assumed to
   determine what local operation a packet goes through.  Therefore,
   local-IDs MUST be unique on each edge and relay nodes.  Local-ID MUST
   be unambiguously bound to the DetNet flow.

5.  DetNet data plane solution

5.1.  DetNet specific packet fields

   The DetNet data plane encapsulation should include two DetNet
   specific information element in each packet of a DetNet flow: (1)
   flow identification and (2) sequence number.

   The DetNet data plane encapsulation may consists further elements
   used for overlay tunneling, to distinguish between DetNet member
   flows of the same DetNet compound flow or to support OAM functions.

5.2.  DetNet encapsulation

   This document specifies two encapsulations for the DetNet data plane:
   (1) PseudoWire (PW) for MPLS PSN and (2) native IPv6 based
   encapsulation for IP PSN.

5.2.1.  PseudoWire-based data plane encapsulation

   Figure 5 illustrates a DetNet PW encapsulation over an MPLS PSN.  The
   PW-based encapsulation of the DetNet flows fits perfectly for the
   Layer-2 interconnect deployment cases (see Figure 2).  Furthermore,
   end to end DetNet service i.e., native DetNet deployment (see
   Figure 3) is also possible if DetNet-aware end systems are capable of
   initiating and termination MPLS encapsulated PWs.  It is also
   possible use the same encapsulation format with a Packet PW over MPLS
   [RFC6658].  Transport of IP encapsulated DetNet flows, see
   Section 5.2.2, over DetNet PWs is also possible.  Interworking

   between PW- and IPv6-based encapsulations is discussed further in
   Section 7.6.

   The PW-based DetNet data plane encapsulation consists of:

   o  DetNet control word (d-CW) containing sequencing information for
      packet replication and duplicate elimination purposes.  There is a
      separate sequence number space for each DetNet flow.

   o  PseudoWire Label (PW Label) that is a standard PW label
      identifying a DetNet flow and a PW Instance within a (DA-)T-PE or
      (DA-)S-PE device.

   o  An optional S-Label that represents DetNet Service LSP used
      between (DA-)T-PE or (DA-)S-PE nodes.  One possible use of an
      S-Label is to identify the different DetNet member flows used to
      provide protection to a DetNet composite flow, perhaps even when
      both LSPs appear on the same link for some reason.

   o  MPLS transport LSP label(s) (T-label) which may be a hop-by-hop
      label used between LSRs.

5.2.2.  Native IPv6-based data plane encapsulation

   Figure 7 illustrates a DetNet native IPv6 encapsulation.  The native
   IPv6 encapsulation is meant for end to end Detnet service use cases,
   where the end stations are DetNet-aware (see Figure 4).  Technically
   it is possible to use the IPv6 encapsulation to tunnel any traffic
   over a DetNet enabled network, which would make native IPv6
   encapsulation also a valid data plane choice for an interconnect use
   case (see Figure 2).

   The native IPv6-based DetNet data plane encapsulation consists of:

   o  IPv6 header as the transport protocol.

   o  IPv6 header Flow Label that is used to help to identify a DetNet
      flow (i.e., roughly an equivalent to the PW Label).  A Flow Label
      together with the IPv6 source address uniquely identifies a DetNet
      flow.

   o  DetNet Control Word IPv6 Destination Option containing sequencing
      information for packet replication and duplicate elimination
      function (PREF) purposes.  The DetNet Destination Option is
      equivalent to the DetNet Control Word.

   A DetNet-aware end station (a host) or an intermediate node
   initiating an IPv6 packet is responsible for setting the Flow Label,
   adding the required DetNet Destination Option, and possibly adding a
   routing header such as the segment routing option (for pre-defined
   paths [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header]).  The payload of the
   native IPv6 encapsulation is any payload protocol that can be
   identified using the Next Header field either in the IPv6 packet
   header or in the last IPv6 extension header.

   A DetNet-aware end station (a host) or an intermediate node receiving
   an IPv6 packet destined to it and containing a DetNet Destination

   Option does the appropriate processing of the packet.  This may
   involve packet duplication and elimination (PREF processing),
   terminating a tunnel or delivering the packet to the upper layers/

5.3.  DetNet flow identification for duplicate detection

   Duplicate elimination depends on flow identification.  Mapping
   between packet fields and Local-ID may impact the implementation of
   duplicate elimination.

5.3.1.  PseudoWire encapsulation

   RFC3985 Section 5.2.1. describes PW sequencing provides a duplicate
   detection service among other things.  This specification clarifies
   this definition as follows:

      DetNet flows that need to undergo PREF processing MUST have the
      same PW Label when they arrive at the DA-*-PE node.

   From the label stack processing point of view receiving the same
   label from multiple sources is analogous to Fast Reroute backup
   tunnel behavior [RFC4090].  The PW Label for a DetNet flow can be
   different on each PW segment.

5.3.2.  Native IPv6 encapsulation

   The DetNet flow identification is based on the IPv6 Flow Label and
   the source address combination.  The two fields uniquelly identify
   the end to end native IPv6 encapsulated DetNet flow.  Obviously, the
   identification fails if any intermediate node modifies either the
   source address or the Flow Label.

6.  PREF specific considerations

   This section applies equally to DetNet flows transported via IPv6 and
   MPLS.  While flow identification and some header related processing
   will differ between the two, the considerations covered in this
   section are common to both.

6.1.  PseudoWire-based data plane

6.1.1.  Forwarder clarifications

   The DetNet specific new functionality in an edge or relay node
   processing is the packet replication and duplication elimination
   function (PREF).  This function is a part of the DetNet-aware
   "extended" forwarder.  The PREF processing is triggered by the
   received packet of a DetNet flow.  Basically the forwarding entry has
   to be extended with a "PREF enabled" boolean configuration switch
   that is associated with the normal forwarding actions (e.g., in case
   of MPLS a swap, push, pop, ..).  The output of the PREF elimination
   function is always a single packet.  The output of the PREF
   replication function is always one or more packets (i.e., 1:M
   replication).  The replicated packets MUST share the same DetNet
   control word sequence number.

   The complex part of the DetNet PREF processing is tracking the
   history of received packets for multiple DetNet member flows.  These



Korhonen, et al.         Expires January 1, 2018               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft       DetNet Data Plane Encapsulation           June 2017


   ingress DetNet member flows (to a node) MUST have the same local-ID
   if they belong to the same DetNet-(compound)-flow and share the same
   sequence number counter and the history information.

   The edge and relay node internal procedures of the PREF are
   implementation specific.  The order of a packet elimination or
   replication is out of scope in this specification.  However, care
   should be taken that the replication function does not actually
   loopback packets as "replicas".  Looped back packets include
   artificial delay when the node that originally initiated the packet
   receives it again.  Also, looped back packets may make the network
   condition to look healthier than it actually is (in some cases link
   failures are not reflected properly because looped back packets make
   the situation appear better than it actually is).

6.1.2.  Edge node processing clarifications

   The DetNet data plane solution overloads the edge node with DetNet
   Edge Node functions.  Edge nodes are also aware of DetNet flows and
   may need to operate upon those.  Figure 9 illustrates the overall
   edge device functions.  The figure shows both physical attachment
   circuit (AC) (e.g., Ethernet [RFC4448]) connecting to the edge node,
   and a packet service connecting to the edge node via an embedded
   router function (similarly as described e.g., in [RFC6658]).  Whether
   traffic flow from a client AC and PSN tunnel receives DetNet specific
   treatment is up to a local configuration and policy.

                   Figure 9: DetNet Edge Node processing

   An edge node participates to the packet replication and duplication
   elimination.  Required processing is done within an extended
   forwarder function.  In the case the native service processing (NSP)
   is IEEE 802.1CB [IEEE8021CB] capable, the packet replication and
   duplicate elimination MAY entirely be done in the NSP and bypassing
   the DetNet flow encapsulation and logic entirely, and thus is able to
   operate over unmodified implementation and deployment.  The NSP
   approach works only between edge nodes and cannot make use of relay
   nodes (see Section 6.1.3).

   The DetNet-aware extended forwarder selects the egress DetNet member
   flow based on the DetNet forwarding rules.  In both "normal AC" and
   "Packet AC" cases there may be no DetNet encapsulation header
   available yet as it is the case with relay nodes (see Section 6.1.3).
   It is the responsibility of the extended forwarder within the edge
   node to push the DetNet specific encapsulation (if not already
   present) to the packet before forwarding it to the appropriate egress
   DetNet member flow instance(s).  The extended forwarder MAY copy the
   sequencing information from the native DetNet packet into the DetNet
   sequence number field and vice versa.  If there is no existing
   sequencing information available in the native packet or the

   forwarder chose not to copy it from the native packet, then the
   extended forwarder MUST maintain a sequence number counter for each
   DetNet flow (indexed by the DetNet flow identification).

6.1.3.  Relay node processing clarifications

   The DetNet data plane solution overloads a relay node with DetNet
   Relay node functions.  Relay node is aware of DetNet flows and may
   operate upon those.  Figure 10 illustrates the overall DetNet relay
   device functions.

   A DetNet Relay node participates to the packet replication and
   duplication elimination.  This processing is done within an extended
   forwarder function.  Whether an ingress DetNet member flow receives
   DetNet specific processing depends on how the forwarding is
   programmed.  For some DetNet member flows the relay node can act as a
   normal relay node and for some apply the DetNet specific processing
   (i.e., PREF).  It is also possible to treat the relay node as a
   transit node, see Section 7.3.  Again, this is entirely up to how the
   forwarding has been programmed.

   The DetNet-aware forwarder selects the egress DetNet member flow
   segment based on the flow identification.  The mapping of ingress
   DetNet member flow segment to egress DetNet member flow segment may
   be statically or dynamically configured.  Additionally the DetNet-
   aware forwarder does duplicate frame elimination based on the flow
   identification and the sequence number combination.  The packet
   replication is also done within the DetNet-aware forwarder.  During
   elimination and the replication process the sequence number of the
   DetNet member flow MUST be preserved and copied to the egress DetNet
   member flow.

7.  Other DetNet data plane considerations

7.1.  Class of Service

   Class and quality of service, i.e., CoS and QoS, are terms that are
   often used interchangeably and confused.  In the context of DetNet,
   CoS is used to refer to mechanisms that provide traffic forwarding
   treatment based on aggregate group basis and QoS is used to refer to
   mechanisms that provide traffic forwarding treatment based on a
   specific DetNet flow basis.  Examples of existing network level CoS
   mechanisms include DiffServ which is enabled by IP header
   differentiated services code point (DSCP) field [RFC2474] and MPLS
   label traffic class field [RFC5462], and at Layer-2, by IEEE 802.1p
   priority code point (PCP).

   CoS for DetNet flows carried in PWs and MPLS is provided using the
   existing MPLS Differentiated Services (DiffServ) architecture



Korhonen, et al.         Expires January 1, 2018               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft       DetNet Data Plane Encapsulation           June 2017


   [RFC3270].  Both E-LSP and L-LSP MPLS DiffServ modes MAY be used to
   support DetNet flows.  The Traffic Class field (formerly the EXP
   field) of an MPLS label follows the definition of [RFC5462] and
   [RFC3270].  The Uniform, Pipe, and Short Pipe DiffServ tunneling and
   TTL processing models are described in [RFC3270] and [RFC3443] and
   MAY be used for MPLS LSPs supporting DetNet flows.  MPLS ECN MAY also
   be used as defined in ECN [RFC5129] and updated by [RFC5462].

   CoS for DetNet flows carried in IPv6 is provided using the standard
   differentiated services code point (DSCP) field [RFC2474] and related
   mechanisms.  The 2-bit explicit congestion notification (ECN)
   [RFC3168] field MAY also be used.

   One additional consideration for DetNet nodes which support CoS
   services is that they MUST ensure that the CoS service classes do not
   impact the congestion protection and latency control mechanisms used
   to provide DetNet QoS.  This requirement is similar to requirement
   for MPLS LSRs to that CoS LSPs do not impact the resources allocated
   to TE LSPs via [RFC3473].

7.2.  Quality of Service

   Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms for flow specific traffic
   treatment typically includes a guarantee/agreement for the service,
   and allocation of resources to support the service.  Example QoS
   mechanisms include discrete resource allocation, admission control,
   flow identification and isolation, and sometimes path control,
   traffic protection, shaping, policing and remarking.  Example
   protocols that support QoS control include Resource ReSerVation
   Protocol (RSVP) [RFC2205] (RSVP) and RSVP-TE [RFC3209] and [RFC3473].
   The existing MPLS mechanisms defined to support CoS [RFC3270] can
   also be used to reserve resources for specific traffic classes.

   In addition to path pinning and packet replication and elimination,
   described in Section 5 above, DetNet provides zero congestion loss
   and bounded latency and jitter.  As described in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture], there are different mechanisms that
   maybe used separately or in combination to deliver a zero congestion
   loss service.  These mechanisms are provided by the either the MPLS
   or IP layers, and may be combined with the mechanisms defined by the
   underlying network layer such as 802.1TSN.

   A baseline set of QoS capabilities for DetNet flows carried in PWs
   and MPLS can provided by MPLS with Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE)
   [RFC3209] and [RFC3473].  TE LSPs can also support explicit routes
   (path pinning).  Current service definitions for packet TE LSPs can
   be found in "Specification of the Controlled Load Quality of
   Service", [RFC2211], "Specification of Guaranteed Quality of



Korhonen, et al.         Expires January 1, 2018               [Page 18]

Internet-Draft       DetNet Data Plane Encapsulation           June 2017


   Service", [RFC2212], and "Ethernet Traffic Parameters", [RFC6003].
   Additional service definitions are expected in future documents to
   support the full range of DetNet services.  In all cases, the
   existing label-based marking mechanisms defined for TE-LSPs and even
   E-LSPs are use to support the identification of flows requiring
   DetNet QoS.

   QoS for DetNet flows carried in IPv6 MUST be provided locally by the
   DetNet-aware hosts and routers supporting DetNet flows.  Such support
   will leverage the underlying network layer such as 802.1TSN.  The
   traffic control mechanisms used to deliver QoS for IP encapsulated
   DetNet flows are expected to be defined in a future document.  From
   an encapsulation perspective, and as defined in Section 5.2.2, the
   combination of the Flow Label together with the IP source address
   uniquely identifies a DetNet flow.

   Packets that are marked with a DetNet Class of Service value, but
   that have not been the subject of a completed reservation, can
   disrupt the QoS offered to properly reserved DetNet flows by using
   resources allocated to the reserved flows.  Therefore, the network
   nodes of a DetNet network SHOULD:

   o  Defend the DetNet QoS by discarding or remarking (to a non-DetNet
      CoS) packets received that are not the subject of a completed
      reservation.

   o  Not use a DetNet reserved resource, e.g. a queue or shaper
      reserved for DetNet flows, for any packet that does not carry a
      DetNet Class of Service marker.

7.3.  Cross-DetNet flow resource aggregation

   The ability to aggregate individual flows, and their associated
   resource control, into a larger aggregate is an important technique
   for improving scaling of control in the data, management and control
   planes.  This document identifies the traffic identification related
   aspects of aggregation of DetNet flows.  The resource control and
   management aspects of aggregation (including the queuing/shaping/
   policing implications) will be covered in other documents.  The data
   plane implications of aggregation are independent for PW/MPLS and IP
   encapsulated DetNet flows.

   DetNet flows transported via MPLS can leverage MPLS-TE's existing
   support for hierarchical LSPs (H-LSPs), see [RFC4206].  H-LSPs are
   typically used to aggregate control and resources, they may also be
   used to provide OAM or protection for the aggregated LSPs.  Arbitrary
   levels of aggregation naturally falls out of the definition for
   hierarchy and the MPLS label stack [RFC3032].  DetNet nodes which



Korhonen, et al.         Expires January 1, 2018               [Page 19]

Internet-Draft       DetNet Data Plane Encapsulation           June 2017


   support aggregation (LSP hierarchy) map one or more LSPs (labels)
   into and from an H-LSP.  Both carried LSPs and H-LSPs may or may not
   use the TC field, i.e., L-LSPs or E-LSPs.  Such nodes will need to
   ensure that traffic from aggregated LSPs are placed (shaped/policed/
   enqueued) onto the H-LSPs in a fashion that ensures the required
   DetNet service is preserved.

   DetNet flows transported via IP have more limited aggregation
   options, due to the available traffic flow identification fields of
   the IP solution.  One available approach is to manage the resources
   associated with a DSCP identified traffic class and to map (remark)
   individually controlled DetNet flows onto that traffic class.  This
   approach also requires that nodes support aggregation ensure that
   traffic from aggregated LSPs are placed (shaped/policed/enqueued) in
   a fashion that ensures the required DetNet service is preserved.

   In both the MPLS and IP cases, additional details of the traffic
   control capabilities needed at a DetNet-aware node may be covered in
   the new service descriptions mentioned above or in separate future
   documents.  Management and control plane mechanisms will also need to
   ensure that the service required on the aggregate flow (H-LSP or
   DSCP) are provided, which may include the discarding or remarking
   mentioned in the previous sections.

7.4.  Bidirectional traffic

   Some DetNet applications generate bidirectional traffic.  Using MPLS
   definitions [RFC5654] there are associated bidirectional flows, and
   co-routed bidirectional flows.  MPLS defines a point-to-point
   associated bidirectional LSP as consisting of two unidirectional
   point-to-point LSPs, one from A to B and the other from B to A, which
   are regarded as providing a single logical bidirectional transport
   path.  This would be analogous of standard IP routing, or PWs running
   over two reciprocal unidirection LSPs.  MPLS defines a point-to-point
   co-routed bidirectional LSP as an associated bidirectional LSP which
   satisfies the additional constraint that its two unidirectional
   component LSPs follow the same path (in terms of both nodes and
   links) in both directions.  An important property of co-routed
   bidirectional LSPs is that their unidirectional component LSPs share
   fate.  In both types of bidirectional LSPs, resource allocations may
   differ in each direction.  The concepts of associated bidirectional
   flows and co-routed bidirectional flows can be applied to DetNet
   flows as well whether IPv6 or MPLS is used.

   While the IPv6 and MPLS data planes must support bidirectional DetNet
   flows, there are no special bidirectional features with respect to
   the data plane other than need for the two directions take the same
   paths.  Fate sharing and associated vs co-routed bidirectional flows



Korhonen, et al.         Expires January 1, 2018               [Page 20]

Internet-Draft       DetNet Data Plane Encapsulation           June 2017


   can be managed at the control level.  Note, that there is no stated
   requirement for bidirectional DetNet flows to be supported using the
   same IPv6 Flow Labels or MPLS Labels in each direction.  Control
   mechanisms will need to support such bidirectional flows for both
   IPv6 and MPLS, but such mechanisms are out of scope of this document.
   An example control plane solution for MPLS can be found in [RFC7551].

7.5.  Layer 2 addressing and QoS Considerations

   The Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Task Group of the IEEE 802.1
   Working Group have defined (and are defining) a number of amendments
   to IEEE 802.1Q [IEEE8021Q] that provide zero congestion loss and
   bounded latency in bridged networks.  IEEE 802.1CB [IEEE8021CB]
   defines packet replication and elimination functions that should
   prove both compatible with and useful to, DetNet networks.

   As is the case for DetNet, a Layer 2 network node such as a bridge
   may need to identify the specific DetNet flow to which a packet
   belongs in order to provide the TSN/DetNet QoS for that packet.  It
   also will likely need a CoS marking, such as the priority field of an
   IEEE Std 802.1Q VLAN tag, to give the packet proper service.

   Although the flow identification methods described in IEEE 802.1CB
   [IEEE8021CB] are flexible, and in fact, include IP 5-tuple
   identification methods, the baseline TSN standards assume that every
   Ethernet frame belonging to a TSN stream (i.e.  DetNet flow) carries
   a multicast destination MAC address that is unique to that flow
   within the bridged network over which it is carried.  Furthermore,
   IEEE 802.1CB [IEEE8021CB] describes three methods by which a packet
   sequence number can be encoded in an Ethernet frame.

   Ensuring that the proper Ethernet VLAN tag priority and destination
   MAC address are used on a DetNet/TSN packet may require further
   clarification of the customary L2/L3 transformations carried out by
   routers and edge label switches.  Edge nodes may also have to move
   sequence number fields among Layer 2, PW, and IPv6 encapsulations.

7.6.  Interworking between PW- and IPv6-based encapsulations

   [Editor's note: add considerations for interworking between PW-based
   and native IPv6-based DetNet encapsuations.]

8.  Time synchronization

   [Editor's note: describe a bit of issues and deployment
   considerations related to time-synchronization within DetNet.  Refer
   to DT discussion and the slides that summarize different approaches




Korhonen, et al.         Expires January 1, 2018               [Page 21]

Internet-Draft       DetNet Data Plane Encapsulation           June 2017


   and rough synchronization performance numbers.  Finally, scope time-
   synchronization solution outside data plane.]

   When DetNet is used, there is an underlying assumption that the
   applicaton(s) require clock synchronization such as the Precision
   Time Protocol (PTP) [IEEE1588].  The relay nodes may or may not
   utilize clock synchronization in order to provide zero congestion
   loss and controlled latency delivery.  In either case, there are a
   few possible approaches of how synchronization protocol packets are
   forwarded and handled by the network:

   o  PTP packets can be sent either as DetNet flows or as high-priority
      best effort packets.  Using DetNet for PTP packets requires
      careful consideration to prevent unwanted interactions between
      clock-synchronized network nodes and the packets that synchronize
      the clocks.

   o  PTP packets are sent as a normal DetNet flow through network nodes
      that are not time-synchronized: in this approach PTP traffic is
      forwarded as a DetNet flow, and as such it is forwarded in a way
      that allows a low delay variation.  However, since intermediate
      nodes do not take part in the synchronization protocol, this
      approach provides a relatively low degree of accuracy.

   o  PTP with on-path support: in this approach PTP packets are sent as
      ordinary or as DetNet flows, and intermediate nodes take part in
      the protocol as Transparent Clocks or Boundary Clocks [IEEE1588].
      The on-path PTP support by intermediate nodes provides a higher
      degree of accuracy than the previous approach.  The actual
      accuracy depends on whether all intermediate nodes are PTP-
      capable, or only a subset of them.

   o  Time-as-a-service: in this approach accurate time is provided as-
      a-service to the DetNet source and destination, as well as the
      intermediate nodes.  Since traffic between the source and
      destination is sent over a provider network, if the provider
      supports time-as-a-service, then accurate time can be provided to
      both the source and the destination of DetNet traffic.  This
      approach can potentially provide the highest degree of accuracy.

   It is expected that the latter approach will be the most common one,
   as it provides the highest degree of accuracy, and creates a layer
   separation between the DetNet data and the synchronization service.

   It should be noted that in all four approaches it is not recommended
   to use replication and elimination for synchronization packets; the
   replication/elimination approach may in some cases reduce the

   synchronization accuracy, since the observed path delay will be
   bivalent.

9.  Management and control considerations

   While management plane and control planes are traditionally
   considered separately, from the Data Plane perspective there is no
   practical difference based on the origin of flow provisioning
   information.  This document therefore does not distinguish between
   information provided by a control plane protocol, e.g., RSVP-TE
   [RFC3209] and [RFC3473], or by a network management mechanisms, e.g.,
   RestConf [RFC8040] and YANG [RFC7950].

   [Editor's note: This section is a work in progress.  discuss here
   what kind of enhancements are needed for DetNet and specifically for
   PREF and DetNet zero congest loss and latency control.  Need to cover
   both traffic control (queuing) and connection control (control
   plane).]

9.1.  PW Label and IPv6 Flow Label assignment and distribution

   The PW label distribution follows the same mechanisms specified for
   MS-PW [RFC6073].  The details of the control plane protocol solution
   required for the label distribution and the management of the label
   number space are out of scope of this document.

   The IPv6 Flow Label distribution and the label number space are out
   of scope of this document.  However, it should be noted that the
   combination of the IPv6 source address and the IPv6 Flow Label is
   assumed to be unique within the DetNet-enabled network.  Therefore,
   as long as each node is able to assign unique Flow Labels for the
   source address(es) it is using the DetNet-enabled network wide flow
   identification uniqueness is guaranteed.

9.2.  Packet replication and elimination

   The control plane protocol solution required for managing the PREF
   processing is outside the scope of this document.

9.3.  Explicit paths

   [TBD: based on MPLS TE and SR.]

9.4.  Congestion protection and latency control

Appendix A.  Example of DetNet data plane operation

   [Editor's note: Add a simplified example of DetNet data plane and how
   labels etc work in the case of MPLS-based PSN and utilizing PREF.
   The figure is subject to change depending on the further DT decisions
   on the label handling..]
