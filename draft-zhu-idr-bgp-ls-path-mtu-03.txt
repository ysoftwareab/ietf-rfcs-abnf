               BGP-LS Extensions for Advertising Path MTU
                    draft-zhu-idr-bgp-ls-path-mtu-03

Abstract

   BGP Link State (BGP-LS) describes a mechanism by which link-state and
   TE information can be collected from networks and shared with
   external components using the BGP routing protocol.  The centralized
   controller (PCE/SDN) completes the service path calculation based on
   the information transmitted by the BGP-LS and delivers the result to
   the Path Computation Client (PCC) through the PCEP or BGP protocol.

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm, which can
   be directly applied to the MPLS architecture with no change on the
   forwarding plane and applied to the IPv6 architecture, with a new
   type of routing header, called SRH.  The SR uses the IGP protocol as
   the control protocol.  Compared to the MPLS tunneling technology, the
   SR does not require additional signaling.  Therefore, the SR does not
   support the negotiation of the Path MTU.  Since Multiple labels or
   SRv6 SIDs are pushed in the packets, it is more likely that the
   packet size exceeds the path mtu of SR tunnel.

   This document specify the extension to BGP Link State (BGP-LS) to
   carry maximum transmission unit (MTU) messages of link.  The PCE/SDN
   calculates the Path MTU while completing the service path calculation
   based on the information transmitted by the BGP-LS.

Internet-Draft BGP-LS Extensions for Advertising Path MTU      July 2020


1.  Introduction

   [RFC7752]describes the implementation mechanism of BGP-LS by which
   link-state and TE information can be collected from networks and
   shared with external components using the BGP routing protocol
   [RFC4271].  BGP-LS allows the necessary Link-State Database (LSDB)
   and Traffic Engineering Database (TEDB) information to be collected
   from the IGP within the network, filtered according to configurable
   policy, and distributed to the PCE as necessary.

   The appropriate MTU size guarantees efficient data transmission.  If
   the MTU size is too small and the packet size is large, fragmentation
   may occur too much and packets are discarded by the QoS queue.  If
   the MTU configuration is too large, packet transmission may be slow.
   PathMTU is the maximum length of a packet that can pass through a
   path without fragmentation.  [RFC1191] describes a technique for
   dynamically discovering the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of an
   arbitrary internet path.

   The traditional MPLS tunneling technology has signaling for
   establishing a path.  [RFC3988] defines the mechanism for
   automatically discovering the Path MTU of LSPs of LDP tunnels.  For a
   certain FEC, the LSR compares the MTU advertised by all downstream
   devices with the MTU of the FEC output interface in the local device,
   and calculates the minimum value for the upstream device.

   [RFC3209] specify the mechanism of MTU signaling in RSVP-TE.  The
   ingress node of the RSVP-TE tunnel sends a Path message to the
   downstream device.  The Adspec object in the Path message carries the
   MTU.  Each node along the tunnel receives a Path message, compares
   the MTU value in the Adspec object with the interface MTU value and
   MPLS MTU configured on the physical output interface of the local
   tunnel , obtains the minimum MTU value, and puts it into the newly
   constructed Path message and continues to send it to the downstream
   equipment.  Thus, the MTU carried in the Path message received by the
   Egress node is the minimum value of the path MTU.  The Egress node
   brings the negotiated Path MTU back to the Ingress node through the
   Resv message.

   Segment Routing (SR) described in [RFC8402] leverages the source
   routing paradigm.  Segment Routing can be directly applied to the
   MPLS architecture with no change on the forwarding plane [RFC8660]
   and applied to the IPv6 architecture with a new type of routing
   header called the SR header (SRH)
   [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header].
   [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-ls-segment-routing-ext] defines SR extensions to
   BGP-LS and specifies the TLVs and sub-TLVs for advertising SR

   information.  Based on the SR information reported by the BGP-LS, the
   SDN can calculate the end-to-end explicit SR-TE paths or SR Policies.

   Nevertheless, Segment Routing is a tunneling technology based on the
   IGP protocol as the control protocol, and there is no additional
   signaling for establishing the path. so the Segment Routing tunnel
   cannot currently support the negotiation mechanism of the MTU.
   Multiple labels or SRv6 SIDs are pushed in the packets.  This causes
   the length of the packets encapsulated in the Segment Routing tunnel
   to increase during packet forwarding.  This is more likely to cause
   packet size exceed than traditional MPLS packet size.

   This document specify the extension to BGP Link State (BGP-LS) to
   carry link maximum transmission unit (MTU) messages.

2.  Deploying scenarios

   This document suggests a solution to extension to BGP Link State
   (BGP-LS) to carry maximum transmission unit (MTU) messages.  The MTU
   information of the link is acquired through the process of collecting
   link state and TE information by BGP-LS.  Concretely, a router
   maintains one or more databases for storing link-state information
   about nodes and links in any given area.  The router's BGP process
   can retrieve topology from these LSDBs and distribute it to a
   consumer, either directly or via a peer BGP speaker (typically a
   dedicated Route Reflector).  [RFC7176] specifies the ISIS mechanism
   and extensions for link MTU Sub-TLV.

   As per [RFC7752], the collection of link-state and TE information and
   its distribution to consumers is shown in the following figure.

3.  BGP_LS Extensions for Path MTU

   [RFC7752] defines the BGP-LS NLRI that can be a Node NLRI, a Link
   NLRI or a Prefix NLRI.  The corresponding BGP-LS attribute is a Node
   Attribute, a Link Attribute or a Prefix Attribute.  [RFC7752] defines
   the TLVs that map link-state information to BGP-LS NLRI and the BGP-
   LS attribute.  Therefore, according to this document, a new sub TLV
   is added to the Link Attribute TLV.

   The format of the sub-TLV is as shown below.


         x  TYPE   - TBD
         x  LENGTH - Total length of the value field, it should be 2
         x  VALUE  - 2-byte MTU value of the link

   Whenever there is a change in MTU value represented by Link Attribute
   TLV, BGP-LS should re-originate the respective TLV with the new MTU
   value.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests assigning a new code-points from the BGP-LS
   Link Descriptor and Attribute TLVs registry as specified in sections
   3.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce security issues beyond those
   discussed in RFC7752.
