Abstract

   This document defines several SDP bandwidth attributes that can be
   used while establishing unicast multimedia sessions with SDP offer/
   answer model.  The defined SDP attributes can also be used to make
   optimized QoS resource allocation decisions over links in the end-to-
   end media path.

Internet-Draft    Bandwidth attributes in SDP O/A model        July 2007


1.  Introduction

   RFC 3264 defines the SDP Offer/answer model for unicast multimedia
   sessions where information from both participants is needed for the
   complete view of the session.  According to RFC 3264, bandwidth
   attribute present in the SDP offer signals the desired bandwidth that
   the offerer would like to receive.  Hence, bandwidth attributes "AS"
   and "TIAS" defined in RFC 3550 and RFC 3890 respectively can only be
   used as receive-only attributes in SDP offer/answer model.  A stream
   receiver (Offerer or Answerer) signals the value of "TIAS" based on
   maximum media bitrate it desires to receive.  The stream sender
   (Answerer or Offerer) may send media at a maximum bitrate much lower
   than "TIAS".  Knowing the sender's (smaller) maximum media bitrate
   and parameters like per packet protocol header overhead enables
   better resource allocation over first/last hop links.  An offerer
   usually does not have a good estimate of 'maxprate' defined in RFC
   3890.  This is due to the fact that the sender's packetization
   behavior is totally outside the control of the stream receiver.
   While using variable rate video codecs, the output RTP packet rate of
   a sender does not remain constant.  Any video bandwidth estimations
   based on maximum video packet rate can be misleading.  Advanced
   packet-switched wide area networks (e.g., 3GPP HSPA) have evolved
   towards providing elastic bandwidth capacity limits to their
   terminals.  Such terminals are allowed to operate in an elastic
   bandwidth zone between two bandwidth limits, the guaranteed bitrate
   (GBR) and the maximum bitrate (MBR).  For example, a video codec can
   adapt its video encoding rate in the elastic bandwidth zone enforced
   by the network.  This document defines two bandwidth attributes which
   capture the elastic media stream bandwidth limits enforced by a
   network on its terminals.

3.  Background

   SDP offer/answer model defined in RFC3264 does not define sufficient
   bandwidth attributes that can help optimized resource allocation over
   links in the end-to-end the media path.  Section 4 captures a use
   case which describes the need for additional SDP attributes.

   Section 5.8 of RFC 4566 defines the syntax for "b=" bandwidth
   attribute.  It also defines the bandwidth type "AS" as application's
   concept of maximum bandwidth.

   According to section 6.2 of RFC 3550, for RTP based applications,
   "AS" includes the header overhead due to lower layer transport and
   network protocols (e.g., UDP, IP ) and does not include the overhead
   due to link level headers.

   Section 6.2 of RFC 3890 defines the bandwidth type "TIAS".  In the
   context of RTP transport, "TIAS" provides the bandwidth for RTP
   payload which includes payload format header and payload data.
   "TIAS" does not include any other layer overhead including RTP layer.

   According to RFC3264, any bandwidth attribute present in an SDP offer
   signals the desired bandwidth that the offerer would like to receive.
   Hence, bandwidth attributes "AS" and "TIAS" defined in RFC 3550 and
   RFC 3890 respectively can only be used as receive-only attributes in
   SDP offer/answer model.

4.  Asymmetric bandwidth problem

   In SDP offer/answer model, the answerer's send bitrate for the stream
   in answerer->offerer direction depends on the value of "AS" or "TIAS"
   signaled in the SDP offer.  The answerer may send media at a bit-rate
   much lower than "AS" or "TIAS" signaled by the offerer.  This could
   be due to several reasons including QoS resource limitation over the
   answerer's first hop link.  Similarly, offerer's send bitrate for the
   stream in offerer->answerer direction may be much lower than "AS" or
   "TIAS" signaled in the SDP answer.

   Wireless wide area networks commonly have some type of QoS
   negotiation enabling the sending device to learn the maximum bitrate
   available over the first hop link (uplink).  Signaling the maximum
   media send bitrate to the receiving device can be beneficial to
   allocate proper QoS resources over the media path.  Such signaling is
   especially useful in preventing resource over allocation over last
   hop wireless link.

   Bandwidth inequality over first and last hop links can also arise
   when the offerer and answerer are attached to different types of
   networks. e.g., Offerer is a cellular device and answerer is a PC
   phone with a more restrictive first hop link speed.

   The 'MSR' bandwidth modifier defined in the following section can be
   used to specify the maximum media bitrate in 'send' direction of a
   stream.  For an example usage, see Section 5.4.

5.  The MSR Bandwidth Modifier

5.1.  Definition

   MSR bandwidth modifier is defined as shown below:

   b=MSR: <bandwidth-value> ; see [7] for ABNF definition.

   The Maximum Send Rate (MSR) bandwidth modifier specifies the maximum
   media bitrate in 'send' direction of a stream in SDP offer/answer
   model.  'MSR' has an integer bit-rate value in bits per second.  A
   fractional bandwidth value SHALL always be rounded up to the next
   integer.  The bandwidth value is the maximum bit-rate without
   counting the protocol header bytes from IP or other transport layers
   like TCP,UDP and RTP.

5.2.  Usage Rules

   'MSR' bandwidth modifier is intended to be used only at the SDP media
   level.  It MUST not be used with a 'recvonly' stream.

5.3.  ABNF Definition

   The bandwidth modifier:

   MSR-bandwidth-def = "b" "=" "MSR" ":" bandwidth-value CRLF

   bandwidth-value = 1*DIGIT

5.4.  Example

   Alice offers a receive only stream to Bob with maximum receive media
   bitrate ("TIAS") 128000bps (H.263 profile 0 level 45).  Bob responds
   with SDP answer by marking the stream as sendonly.  Note that the SDP
   answer from Bob does not include any bandwidth attribute as it
   contains a sendonly stream.


   [Offer from Alice]
   m=video 34564 RTP/AVP 96
   a=rtpmap:96 h263-1998/90000
   a=fmtp:96 profile=0; level=45;
   b=TIAS:128000
   a=maxprate:20
   a=recvonly

   [Answer from Bob]
   m=video 46236 RTP/AVP 96
   a=rtpmap:96 h263-1998/90000
   a=fmtp:96 profile=0;level=45;
   a=sendonly

   Due to QoS limitation on its first hop link, Bob can send media at
   maximum bitrate of 64000bps only.  Unaware of Bob's maximum media
   bitrate, Alice overallocates QoS resources on its access (last hop)
   link.  Signaling Bob's maximum media bitrate in the SDP answer can
   help Alice reserve correct QoS resources in its access (last hop)
   link.  The complete offer/answer example with proposed bandwidth
   attribute 'MSR' is shown below.

6.  Additional bandwidth attributes for optimized QoS resource
    allocation

   Note that 'MSR' attribute alone is not sufficient to capture the end
   to end QoS requirement for a unicast media stream.  A media sender is
   not aware of the actual bit-rate that results over the last hop
   downlink of the receiver.  Signaling per packet overhead (PPO) at the
   receiver's downlink can help a sender estimate the resulting bit-rate
   over the receiver's downlink.  The attributes defined in the
   following section can help both sender and receiver compute the
   bitrate that results over first and last hop links.  An underlying
   assumption is that the media bit-rate (excluding the header overhead)
   will not change end to end.  There might be changes in the protocol
   header overhead as the media traverses different types of networks
   (E.g.,IPv4 to IPv6 cloud).

6.1.  MSPR

   Maximum Send Packet Rate (MSPR) is defined as the maximum RTP packet
   rate at a stream sender.  This is a send only attribute and it is
   signaled by media sender.  An intermediate node (Gateway or a SIP
   B2BUA) which performs protocol layer translation (e.g., IPv4 to IPv6)
   can use this attribute to estimate the total stream bandwidth,
   including protocol overhead, that is required in the destination
   network.

6.2.  PPO

   Per Packet Overhead (PPO) is defined as the average per packet
   overhead counted in bytes, measured from layer 'X' to the RTP media
   layer (including the RTP header), where layer 'X' can be any layer
   below RTP.  This is a receive only attribute and it is signaled by
   media receiver.

6.3.  RB

   Receive Bit-rate (RB) is defined as the last hop's maximum receiver
   bit-rate at layer 'X'.  'RB' will be same as 'AS' if 'X' is IP layer
   and there is no compression above IP layer.  This is a receive only
   attribute and it is signaled by media receiver.  According to
   RFC3550, the bandwidth attribute "AS" can be used only when IP/UDP/
   RTP headers are not compressed.  "RB" is useful in environments where
   a link in the media path uses header compression.

6.4.  Bit-rate over the last and first hop links

   Using the attributes defined in the above sections and using the
   following formula, a sender can calculate the resulting bit-rate over



Desineni & Leung        Expires January 19, 2008                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft    Bandwidth attributes in SDP O/A model        July 2007


   the receiver's last hop link, at the same layer 'X' at which RB was
   computed.

   br-last-hop is the maximum media bit-rate over the last hop link.

   br-last-hop = MSR + (MSPR * PPO)

   To prevent exceeding the capacity of the last hop link, a media
   sender can choose a combination of MSR and MSPR such that the value
   of br-last-hop does not exceed the value of RB signaled by the media
   receiver.

   (MSR+(MSPR * PPO)) <= RB

   A sender may not send at RB due to bandwidth limitations over its
   immediate first hop link.  Under such circumstances, signaling the
   value of br-last-hop can benefit the receiver to allocate only
   necessary QoS resources over its downlink. br-last-hop can be
   signaled using the attribute 'SB' (Send Bandwidth).  A sender has the
   freedom to choose a combination of actual media bit-rate and actual
   packet rate as long as the resulting value of SB does not exceed the
   value of RB.  A media sender will choose SB such that SB <= RB.  SB
   can be calculated using the following formula:

   SB = (Actual MSR + Actual packet rate * PPO over the receiver's
   downlink)

   Note that both SB and RB denote the bit-rate at the same protocol
   layer 'X' on the receiver's link as selected by the receiver when
   reporting its PPO value.  This document recommends stream receivers
   to signal the SDP attributes 'RB' and 'PPO' at layer 'X', and TIAS.
   It recommends stream senders to signal the attributes 'SB' also at
   layer 'X' and 'MSR'.

6.5.  Example offer/answer exchange

   Alice make the following SDP offer Bob. Alice's downlink has 40 bytes
   of per packet protocol overhead and it can support video at a maximum
   bit-rate of 140800bps (including protocol overhead).  Alice can send
   video at a maximum bit rate of 64000bps (excluding protocol
   overhead).


   m=video <>
   b=TIAS:128000 (bps)
   b=RB:140800   (bps)
   a=PPO:40  (bytes)
   b=MSR:64000 (bps)

   Bob sends the following SDP answer in response to the SDP offer from
   Alice.  Bob's downlink can provide the QoS resources required to
   support Alice's video stream.  Bob's uplink video stream requires
   less QoS resources than offered over Alice's downlink.

7.  Obsolete the RFC3890 mandated usage of 'maxprate' with 'TIAS'

   Per RFC3890, it is mandatory to signal 'maxprate' with 'TIAS'.  The
   following are some of the disadvantages of this approach.

   An encoder implementation for an application typically only supports
   a limited number of packetization rates.  For example, a speech
   service usually has a fixed frame duration and video encoders may be
   optimized for only generating a certain number of video slices per
   video frame at certain video frame rates.  Without knowledge of these
   implementation limitations, a media receiver may easily set a
   maxprate value that does not match any of the sender's packetization
   rates.  This can result in unnecessarily restrictive operation as the
   sender has to use a lower packetization rate, thus underutilizing the
   bandwidth at the receiver's link.  This could even result in no
   usable packetization rate if maxprate is set below the encoder's
   minimum rate.

   Furthermore, the purpose of maxprate is for the receiver to use this
   along with the TIAS parameter to limit the total stream bandwidth
   (including overhead) the sender would send over the receiver's link.
   However, compared to the 'PPO' and 'RB' parameters specified in
   sections 6.2 and 6.3 of this document, this approach is unnecessarily
   restrictive for achieving a bandwidth limit at the receiver.  This
   prevents the sender from choosing among all combinations of media bit
   rates and packetization rates that would meet the receiver's
   bandwidth restrictions.

   Due to the above reasons, the mandatory usage of 'maxprate' with
   ''TIAS' in offer/answer model is obsoleted by this document.  Note
   that a streaming session is still allowed to use 'maxprate' with
   'TIAS' in a declarative manner.  (Note: At the time of writing this
   document, per the knowledge of the authors, there are no offer/answer
   implementations of 'maxprate' with 'TIAS'.  There are only
   declarative TIAS implementations in the offer/answer model)

8.  Elastic bit-rate limits

   A flow is elastic if its source can handle the transport of its data
   over varying transport conditions such as variations in available
   bandwidth.  To enable time-sensitive elastic applications such as
   packet-switched multimedia services to make more accurate use of
   elastic bandwidth capacity, some type of networks(e.g., 3GPP) are
   signalling both minimum guaranteed bandwidth and maximum elastic
   bandwidth limits to terminals in their network.

   The following parameters (ERB,ESB) enable end-terminals to coordinate
   and negotiate the elastic bandwidth limits provided by their
   respective networks.  ERB and ESB shall always be set to the
   bandwidth values granted by the access network.  Note that ERB and
   ESB are bit-rate values at the same protocol layer 'X' at which PPO
   attribute was signaled by the media receiver.

8.1.  ERB

   ERB: Same as "RB" except that it indicates maximum receivable elastic
   throughput including media and overhead to protocol layer X. This is
   set based on a maximum elastic throughput limit communicated to the
   receiver by its network (Downlink MBR in 3GPP network).  Combined
   with ERB information a sender can choose what combinations of media
   rate and packetization rate could fit through the receiver's "maximum
   receivable elastic bandwidth" constraint at layer X. This is a
   receive only attribute and hence signaled by only a media receiver.

8.2.  ESB

   ESB: Same as "SB" except that it indicates maximum sending elastic
   throughput including media and overhead at protocol layer X. Layer
   'X' is same as the layer at which ERB is signaled.  This is set based
   on a maximum elastic throughput limit communicated to the sender by
   its network (Uplink MBR in 3GPP network).  This is a sendonly
   attribute and hence signaled by only a media sender.  Note that this
   attribute is sent only in response to "ERB" attribute received from a
   media receiver.

8.3.  Example

   SDP offer from Alice to Bob: Using ERB, Alice signals the bandwidth
   granted by its access network.
