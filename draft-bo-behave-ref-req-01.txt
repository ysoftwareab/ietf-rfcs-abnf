Internet-Draft            Referral Requirements             October 2009


1.  Introduction

   Mobile operators are using referrals in their network to make
   entities reachable straightforward.  However, this simple approach is
   failed by deployment of firewall and translator (like NAT) in the
   network, in which causes the translation function happened during the
   communication.  This document is intended to discuss about the
   requirements that need to be met by the potential referral
   modifications in the mobile network.

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Requirements of referral design

2.1.  R1 Standard referral format

   The referral formats need to be standardized.  Applications can
   understand the meaning of referral informed, such as IP address,
   possibly protocol and port numbers.  However, there is an open
   question whether this standard referral design should be use for new
   applications only, or including all existing applications.

2.2.  R2 Simplify ALG during NAT traversal

   There are middle boxes, like firewalls and translators, exist in the
   mobile network, which cause applications need to do translations,
   especially ALG.  The cost of translation functions included ALG is
   huge for the mobile operator in terms of implementation, performance.
   Standard referral could simplify ALG implementation during NAT
   traversal in the mobile network.

2.3.  R3 Network inspection consideration

   Operators sometimes need to inspect information or details during
   communication for administration motivations.  If referral format is
   standardized, it is easy for operator to capture and investigate the
   communication information they required.
