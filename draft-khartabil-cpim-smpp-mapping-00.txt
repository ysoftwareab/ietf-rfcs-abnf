Abstract 
 
   Messaging is the fastest growing means of communication in the 
   world. Mobile telephony and SMS have also been growing at an 
   enormous rate, eventually bound to edge out traditional telephony 
   systems in volumes and importance. 
    
   Presence and Instant Messaging have become the cornerstones of 
   modern communication. Mobile Presence integrates the concepts of 
   presence over fixed and wireless networks for a wide variety of 
   terminals. 
    
   This memo introduces protocol mapping between CPIM [1], an IETF 
   presence and messaging protocol, and SMPP [2], an SMS protocol. This 
   brings the Presence and Instant Messaging service to the mobile 
   user.

1.0 Introduction 
 
   Until today, presence updates can only be done through accessing a 
   PC or a PDA. The problem arises when a person needs to update 
   his/her presence information whilst they are in a public place, on a 
   street or any other place where there is no access to a PC. Also, 
   PDA are very expensive and are very scarce in the market today.  The 
   average user on the street needing to update the presence 
   information does not have means of doing so. 
    
   This memo introduces protocol mapping between CPIM [1], an IETF 
   presence and messaging protocol, and SMPP [2], an SMS protocol, 
   through some Gateway. This brings the Presence and Instant Messaging 
   service to the mobile user. 
    
   CPIM complaint client users want to send IMÆs to Mobile phones (GSM 
   numbers) and the Mobile users need to be able to send replies back 
   to the CPIM complaint client user by pushing just the REPLY button 
   in their mobile phone. Therefore the IMs (SMSs) need to be sent 
   between two legitimate GSM numbers.

Internet Draft         CPIM to UCP/EMI Mapping           January 2002 
   An example below shows a CPIM message, according to [4]: 
    
    
         m: Content-type: Message/CPIM 
         s: 
         h: From: Hisham Khartabil <im:hisham.khartabil@hosip.com>  
         h: To: Tarek El Diab <im:tarek.diab@hotsip.com>  
         h: Date: 2001-12-23T14:40:00-08:00 
         s: 
         e: Content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8 
         e: Content-ID: 1234567890@hotsip.com 
         e: 
         e: Here is the text of my message. 
    
   The relevant parts from the CPIM message are the From-header, To-
   header and the Message-content. 
    
   The following SMPP message example shows the result of the mapping 
   from the above CPIM message: 
    
   00 00 00 37 00 00 00 04 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 00 01 00 01 01 33 35 
   38 30 30 36 37 38 39 30 00 01 01 33 35 38 30 30 30 31 32 33 34 35 00 
   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 
    
   More generic: 
   Header = 32 bytes 
   00 00 00 37  =  Command-Length 
   00 00 00 04  =  Command-ID 
   00 00 00 00  =  Command-Status 
   00 00 00 01  =  Sequence-No. 
    
   Message-Body : Contains source and destination address and message 
   amongst other parameters 
   00 01 00 01 01 33 35 38 30 30 36 37 38 39 30 00 01 01 33 35 38 30 30 
   30 31 32 33 34 35 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 
    
 
3.1 From-header mapping 
    
   There are two options here: 
    
   An ENUM [3] lookup is performed on the URL in the from-header. This 
   lookup returns a phone number that is to be used.  This phone number 
   is stored in the SMPP's Source-addr header. 
    
   The second option is assigning a temporary number to the SMPP 
   Source-addr, this helps the gateway map any replies by the recipient 
   to the original message. 
    
3.2 To-header mapping 
    
   An ENUM [3] lookup is performed on the URL in the to-header. This 
   lookup returns a phone number that is to be used.  This phone number 
   is stored in the SMPP's Destination-addr header. 
 
Khartabil                                                     [Page 3] 

Internet Draft         CPIM to UCP/EMI Mapping           January 2002 
    
   If a phone number is already in the user-name portion of the im URL, 
   this number can be used as the Destination-addr number. 
    
3.3 Message-content mapping 
    
   The CPIM Message-content is encoded according to [2] then copied 
   directly into the SMPP's Short-message header if the CPIM Message-
   content length is smaller than 160 characters. 
    
   When the CPIM message Message-content is greater than 160 
   characters, there needs to be multiple SMPP messages sent out. This 
   is due to the limitations of the GSM SMS.  
    
   The multiple SMPP messages will have the same Source-addr and 
   Destination-addr, but the Sequence-No. value would increment for 
   every message with the different Message-content. For example, if a 
   message with content-length 430 is being sent from: Hisham Khartabil 
   <im:hisham.khartabil@hotsip.com> to: Tarek El Diab 
   <im:tarek.eldiab@hotsip.com> who is on a GSM phone connected to a 
   SMPP enabled SMSC, then that message needs to be mapped to a SMPP 
   message(s). The first 160 characters will be in the first mapped 
   SMPP message with an Source-addr value of Hisham's GSM number, 
   Destination-addr value of TarekÆs GSM number. The Sequence-No. value 
   of, say, 37 is assigned. The second mapped SMPP message will have 
   the same Source-addr and Destination-addr values of the first 
   message, with the message content from 161 to 320. The Sequence-No. 
   value will be 38. The final mapped SMPP message will have the same 
   Source-addr and Destination-addr values with the last characters 321 
   to 430 with a Sequence-No. value of 39. 
    
4.0 SMPP-side Originated Instant Message (SMS) 
    
4.1 Source-addr mapping 
    
   The SMPP Source-addr field will be in the form of a mobile phone 
   number. This is made into a CPIM From-header by: 
    
   - Either attaching the host name at the end of the number, and by 
   adding the string ôim:ö in front of the number, or 
   - Performing an ENUM lookup on the number and retrieving the im 
   address of the intended recipient. 
    
4.2 Destination-addr mapping 
    
   The SMPP Destination-addr field will be in the form of a mobile 
   phone number. This is made into a CPIM To-header by: 
    
   - Either attaching the host name at the end of the number, and by 
   adding the string ôim:ö in front of the number, or 
   - Performing an ENUM lookup on the number and retrieving the im 
   address of the intended recipient. 
    
4.3 Short-message mapping 
 
Khartabil                                                     [Page 4] 

Internet Draft         CPIM to UCP/EMI Mapping           January 2002 
    
   The message content of the SMPP message stored in the Short-message 
   field is converted into ASCII, UTF-8 or any other desired character 
   set. It is then copied into the CPIM message-content field. 
    
5.0 CPIM-Side Originated NOTIFY 
    
   The from-header and to-header mapping are exactly as defined in 
   section 3.1 and 3.2 respectively. This section will only talk about 
   the message-content mapping. 
    
   According to [5], a CPIM NOTIFY looks like this: 
    
         m: Content-type: Message/CPIM 
         s: 
         h: From: Tarek Eldiab <im:tarek.eldiab@hotsip.com> 
         h: To: Hisham Khartabil <im:hisham.khartabil@hosip.com>  
         h: Date: 2001-12-13T13:40:00-08:00 
         s: 
         e: Content-type: application/cpim-pidf+xml 
         e: Content-ID: 1234567890@hotsip.com 
         e: Content-Length: .. . 
    
          <presence xmlns="urn:ietf:params:cpim-presence:"> 
            <presentity id="pres:tarek.eldiab@hotsip.com"> 
            <tuple id="mobile-phone"> 
              <status> 
                <value>open</value> 
              </status> 
              <contact priority="9">tel:09012345678</contact> 
              <note>Call me please!</note> 
            </tuple> 
          </presence> 
    
   Short-message is build from 3 components of the pidf mime body: 
   presentity id, value and note. 
    
   The final SMS could look like: "tarek.eldiab@hotsip.com (open, Call 
   me please!)" 
    
   Or to save some SMS characters, you could represent is as follows: 
   "tarek eldiab (+, Call me please!)". 
    
6.0 UCP-Side Originated NOTIFY 
    
   The Source-addr and Destiantion-addr mapping are exactly as defined 
   in section 4.1 and 4.2 respectively. This section will only talk 
   about the Short-message mapping. 
    
   The short-message could look like "hisham.khartabil@hotsip.com 
   (closed, sleeping)" or "Hisham (-, sleeping)" 
    
   Building this is easy: 
   - tuple id is mobile-phone 
 
Khartabil                                                     [Page 5] 

Internet Draft         CPIM to UCP/EMI Mapping           January 2002 
   - presentity id is found like the from-header (by ENUM lookup), or 
   by just copying the from-header 
   - value is closed (the - signed means closed) 
   - contact is the originator's mobile phone number as a tel-url 
   - note is also copied from the SMS itself. 
    
   The final presence document would look like: 
    
          <presence xmlns="urn:ietf:params:cpim-presence:"> 
            <presentity id="pres:hisham.khartabil@hotsip.com"> 
            <tuple id="mobile-phone"> 
              <status> 
                <value>closed</value> 
              </status> 
              <contact priority="9">tel:0407654321</contact> 
              <note>sleeping</note> 
            </tuple> 
          </presence>
