               draft-geib-ippm-connectivity-monitoring-03

Abstract

   Within a Segment Routing domain, segment routed measurement packets
   can be sent along pre-determined paths.  This enables new kinds of
   measurements.  Connectivity monitoring allows to supervise the state
   and performance of a connection or a (sub)path from one or a few
   central monitoring systems.  This document specifies a suitable
   type-P connectivity monitoring metric.

1.  Introduction

   Within a Segment Routing domain, measurement packets can be sent
   along pre-determined segment routed paths [RFC8402].  A segment
   routed path may consist of pre-determined sub paths, specific router-
   interfaces or a combination of both.  A measurement path may also
   consist of sub paths spanning multiple routers, given that all
   segments to address a desired path are available and known at the SR
   domain edge interface.

   A Path Monitoring System or PMS (see [RFC8403]) is a dedicated
   central Segment Routing (SR) domain monitoring device (as compared to
   a distributed monitoring approach based on router-data and -functions
   only).  Monitoring individual sub-paths or point-to-point connections
   is executed for different purposes.  IGP exchanges hello messages
   between neighbors to keep alive routing and swiftly adapt routing to
   topology changes.  Network Operators may be interested in monitoring
   connectivity and congestion of interfaces or sub-paths at a timescale
   of seconds, minutes or hours.  In both cases, the periodicity is
   significantly smaller than commodity interface monitoring based on

   router counters, which may be collected on a minute timescale to keep
   the processor- or monitoring data-load low.

   The IPPM architecture was a first step to that direction [RFC2330].
   Commodity IPPM solutions require dedicated measurement systems, a
   large number of measurement agents and synchronised clocks.
   Monitoring a domain from edge to edge by commodity IPPM solutions
   increases scalability of the monitoring system.  But localising the
   site of a detected change in network behaviour may then require
   network tomography methods.

   The IPPM Metrics for Measuring Connectivity offer generic
   connectivity metrics [RFC2678].  These metrics allow to measure
   connectivity between end nodes without making any assumption on the
   paths between them.  The metric and the type-p packet specified by
   this document follow a different approach: they are designed to
   monitor connectivity and performance of a specific single link or a
   path segment.  The underlying definition of connectivity is partially
   the same: a packet not reaching a destination indicates a loss of
   connectivity.  An IGP re-route may indicate a loss of a link, while
   it might not cause loss of connectivity between end systems.  The
   metric specified here enables link-loss detection, if the change in
   end-to-end delay along a new route is differing from that of the
   original path.

   A Segment Routing PMS which is part of an SR domain is IGP topology
   aware, covering the IP and (if present) the MPLS layer topology
   [RFC8402].  This allows to steer PMS measurement packets along
   arbitrary pre-determined concatenated sub-paths, identified by
   suitable segments.  Basically, a number of overlaid measurement paths
   is set up.  The delays of packets sent along each on of these paths
   is measured.  Single changes in topology cause correlated changes in
   the measurement packet delay (or packet loss) of different
   measurement paths.  By a suitable set up, the number of measurement
   paths may be limited to one per connection (or sub-path) to be
   monitored.  In addition to information revealed by a commodity ICMP
   ping measurement, the metric and method specified here identify the
   location of a congested interface.  To do so, tomography assumptions
   and methods are combined to first plan the overlaid SR measurement
   path set up and later on to evaluate the captured delay measurements.

   This document specifies a type-p metric determining properties of an
   SR path which allows to monitor connectivity and congestion of
   interfaces and further allows to locate the path or interface which
   caused a change in the reported type-p metric.  This document is
   focussed on the MPLS layer, but the methodology may be applied within
   SR domains or MPLS domains in general.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  A brief segment routing connectivity monitoring framework

   The Segment Routing IGP topology information consists of the IP and
   (if present) the MPLS layer topology.  The minimum SR topology
   information consists of Node-Segment-Identifiers (Node-SID),
   identifying an SR router.  The IGP exchange of Adjacency-SIDs [I-
   D.draft-ietf-isis-segment-routing-extensions], which identify local
   interfaces to adjacent nodes, is optional.  It is RECOMMENDED to
   distribute Adj-SIDs in a domain operating a PMS to monitor
   connectivity as specified below.  If Adj-SIDs aren't availbale,
   [RFC8029] provides methods how to steer packets along desired paths
   by the proper choice of an MPLS Echo-request IP-destination address.
   A detailed description of [RFC8029] methods as a replacement of Adj-
   SIDs is out of scope of this document.

   A round trip measurement between two adjacent nodes is a simple
   method to monitor connectivity of a connecting link.  If multiple
   links are operational between two adjacent nodes and only a single
   one fails, a single plain round trip measurement may fail to identify
   which link has failed.  A round trip measurement also fails to
   identify which interface is congested, even if only a single link
   connects two adjacent nodes.

   Segment Routing enables the set-up of extended measurement loops.
   Several different measurement loops can be set up.  If these form a
   partial overlay, any change in the network properties impacts more
   than a single loop's round trip time (or causes drops of packets of
   more than one loop).  Randomly chosen loop paths including the
   interfaces or paths to be monitored may fail to produce unique result
   patterns.  The approach picked here uses specified measurement loop
   and path overlay design.  A centralised monitoring approach benefits
   from keeping the number of required measurement loops low.  This
   improves scalability by minimising the number of measurement loops.
   This also keeps the number of required packets and results to be
   evaluated and correlated low.

   An additional property of the measurement path set-up specified below
   is that it allows to estimate the packet round trip and the one way
   delay of a monitored link (or path).  The delay along a single link
   is not perfectly symmetric.  Packet processing causes small delay
   differences per interface and direction.  These cause an error, which
   can't be quantified or removed by the specified method.  Quantifying

   this error requires a different measurement set-up.  As this will
   introduce additional measurements loops, packets and evaluations, the
   cost in terms of reduced scalability is not felt to be worth the
   benefit in measurement accuracy.  IPPM however honors precision more
   than accuracy and the mentioned processing differences are relatively
   stable, resulting in relatively precise delay estimates.

   An example SR domain is shown below.  The PMS shown should monitor
   the connectivity of all 6 links between nodes L100 and L200 one one
   side and the connected nodes L050, L060 and L070 on the other side.
   The round trip times per measurement loop are assumed to exhibit
   unique delays.

   The SID values are picked for convenient reading only.  Node-SID: 100
   identifies L100, Node-SID: 300 identifies L300 and so on.  Adj-SID

   Adj-SID 60200: Adjacency L60 to L200

   Monitoring the 6 links between Ln00 and L0m0 nodes requires 6
   measurement loops, each of which has the following properties:

   o  Each loop follows a single round trip from one Ln00 to one L0m0
      (e.g., between L100 and L050).

   o  Each loop passes two more links: one between that Ln00 and another
      L0m0 and from there to the other Ln00 (e.g., between L100 and L060
      and then L060 to L200)

   o  Every link is passed by a single round trip per measurement loop
      only once and only once unidirectional by two other loops, and the

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                  July 2020


      latter two pass along opposing directions (that's three loops
      passing each single link, e.g., one having a round trip L100 to
      L050 and back, a second passing L100 to L050 only and a third loop
      passing L050 to L100 only).

   Note that any 6 links between two to six nodes can be monitored that
   way too (if multiple parallel links between two nodes are monitored,
   the differences in delay may require a sufficiently high clock
   resulotion, if applicable).

   This results in 6 measurement loops for the given example (the start
   and end of each measurement loop is PMS to L300 to L100 or L200 and a
   similar sub-path on the return leg.  It is ommitted here for
   brevity):

   1.  M1 is the delay along L100 -> L050 -> L100 -> L060 -> L200

   2.  M2 is the delay along L100 -> L060 -> L100 -> L070 -> L200

   3.  M3 is the delay along L100 -> L070 -> L100 -> L050 -> L200

   4.  M4 is the delay along L200 -> L050 -> L200 -> L060 -> L100

   5.  M5 is the delay along L200 -> L060 -> L200 -> L070 -> L100

   6.  M6 is the delay along L200 -> L070 -> L200 -> L050 -> L100

   An example for a stack of a loop consisting of Node-SID segments
   allowing to caprture M1 is (top to bottom): 100 | 050 | 100 | 060 |
   200 | PMS.

   An example for a stack of Adj-SID segments the loop resulting in M1
   is (top to bottom): 100 | 10050 | 50100 | 10060 | 60200 | PMS.  As
   can be seen, the Node-SIDs 100 and PMS are present at top and bottom
   of the segment stack.  Their purpose is to transport the packet from
   the PMS to the start of the measurement loop at L100 and return it to
   the PMS from its end.

   The measurement loops set up as shown have the following properties:

   o  If the loops are set up using Node-SIDs only, any single complete
      loss of connectivity caused by a failing single link between any
      Ln00 and any L0m0 node briefly disturbs (and changes the measured
      delay) of three loops.  Traffic to Node-SIDs is rerouted.

   o  If the loops are set up using Adj-SIDs only (and Node-SIDs only to
      send the packet from PMS to the loop starting point and from the
      loop end back to the PMS), any single complete loss of

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                  July 2020


      connectivity caused by a failing single link between any Ln00 and
      any L0m0 node terminates the traffic along three loops.  The
      packets of these loops will be dropped, until the link gets back
      into service.  Traffic to Adj-SIDs is not rerouted.

   o  Any congested single interface between any Ln00 and any L0m0 node
      only impacts the measured delay of two measurement loops.

   o  As an example, the formula for a single Round Trip Delay (RTD) is
      shown here 4 * RTD_L100-L050-L100 = 3 * M1 + M3 + M6 - M2 - M4 -
      M5

   A closer look reveals that each single event of interest for the
   proposed metric, which are a loss of connectivity or a case of
   congestion, uniquely only impacts a single a-priori determinable set
   of measurement loops.  If, e.g., connectivity is lost between L200
   and L050, measurement loops (3), (4) and (6) indicate a change in the
   measured delay.

   As a second example, if the interface L070 to L100 is congested,
   measurement loops (3) and (5) indicate a change in the measured
   delay.  Without listing all events, all cases of single losses of
   connectivity or single events of congestion influence only delay
   measurements of a unique set of measurement loops.

   A congestion event adding latency to two specific measurement loops
   allows calculation of the delay added by the queue at the congested
   interface.  Thus, the resulting RTD increase can be assigned to a
   single interface.

      from which the sample Path-Connectivity-and-Congestion metric is
      taken MUST all be of the same length.

   o  MLA, a Monitoring Loop Address information ensuring that a

      and -_c MUST NOT be identical.

   o  P, the specification of the packet type, over and above the source
      and destination addresses

   o  DS, a constant time interval between two type-P packets

3.3.  Metric Units

   A sequence of consecutive time values.

3.4.  Definition

   A moving average of AV time values per measurement path is compared
   by a change point detection algorithm.  The temporal packet spacing
   value DS represents the smallest period within which a change in
   connectivity or congestion may be detected.

   A single loss of connectivity of a sub-path between two nodes affects
   three different measurement paths.  Depending on the value chosen for
   DS, packet loss might occur (note that the moving average evaluation
   needs to span a longer period than convergence time; alternatively,
   packet-loss visible along the three measurement paths may serve as an
   evaluation criterium).  After routing convergence the type-p packets
   along the three measurement paths show a change in delay.

   A congestion of a single interface of a sub-path connecting two nodes
   affects two different measurement paths.  The the type-p packets
   along the two congested measurement paths show an additional change
   in delay.

3.5.  Discussion

   Detection of a multiple losses of monitored sub-path connectivity or
   congestion of a multiple monitored sub-paths may be possible.  These
   cases have not been investigated, but may occur in the case of Shared
   Risk Link Groups.  Monitoring Shared Risk LinkGroups and sub-paths
   with multiple failures abd congestion is not within scope of this
   document.

3.6.  Methodologies

   For the given type-p, the methodology is as follows:

   o  The set of measurement paths MUST be routed in a way that each
      single loss of connectivity and each case of single interface
      congestion of one of the sub-paths passed by a type-p packet
      creates a unique pattern of type-p packets belonging to a subset
      of all configured measurement paths indicate a change in the
      measured delay.  As a minimum, each sub-path to be monitored MUST
      be passed

   o

      *  by one measurement_path_1 and its type-p packet in
         bidirectional direction

      *  by one measurement_path_2 and its type-p packet in "downlink"
         direction

      *  by one measurement_path_3 and its type-p packet in "uplink"
         direction

   o  "Uplink" and "Downlink" have no architectural relevance.  The
      terms are chosen to express, that the packets of
      measurement_path_2 and measuremnt_path_3 pass the monitored sub-
      path unidirectional in opposing direction.  Measuremnt_path_1,
      measurement_path_2 and measurement_path_3 MUST NOT be identical.

   o  All measurement paths SHOULD terminate between identical sender
      and receiver interfaces.  It is recommended to connect the sender
      and receiver as closely to the paths to be monitored as possible.
      Each intermediate sub-path between sender and receiver one one
      hand and sub-paths to be monitored is an additional source of
      errors requiring separate monitoring.

   o  Segment Routed domains supporting Node- and Adj-SIDs should enable
      the monitoring path set-up as specified.  Other routing protocols
      may be used as well, but the monitoring path set up might be
      complex or impossible.

   o  Pre-compute how the two and three measurement path delay changes
      correlate to sub-path connectivity and congestion patterns.
      Absolute change valaues aren't required, a simultaneous change of
      two or three particular measurement paths is.

   o  Ensure that the temporal resolution of the measurement clock
      allows to reliably capture a unique delay value for each



Geib                     Expires January 4, 2021                [Page 9]

      configured measurement path while sub-path connectivity is
      complete and no congestion is present.

   o  Synchronised clocks are not strictly required, as the metric is
      evaluating differences in delay.  Changes in clock synchronisation
      SHOULD NOT be close to the time interval within which changes in
      connectivity or congestion should be monitored.

   o  At the Src host, select Src and Dst IP addresses, and address
      information to route the type-p packet along one of the configured
      measurement path.  Form a test packet of Type-P with these
      addresses.

   o  Configure the Dst host access to receive the packet.

   o  At the Src host, place a timestamp, a sequence number and a unique
      identifier of the measurement path in the prepared Type-P packet,
      and send it towards Dst.

   o  Capture the one-way delay and determine packet-loss by the metrics
      specified by [RFC7679] and [RFC7680] respectively and store the
      result for the path.

   o  If two or three subpaths indicate a change in delay, report a
      change in connectivity or congestion status as pre-computed above.

   o  If two or three sub paths indicate a change in delay, report a
      change in connectivity or congestion status as pre-computed above.

   Note that monitoring 6 sub paths requires setting up 6 monitoring
   paths as shown in the figure above.

3.7.  Errors and Uncertainties

   Sources of error are:

   o  Measurement paths whose delays don't indicate a change after sub-
      path connectivity changed.

   o  A timestamps whose resolution is missing or inacurrate at the
      delays measured for the different monitoring paths.

   o  Multiple occurrences of sub path connectivity and congestion.

   o  Loss of connectivity and congestion along sub-paths connecting the

3.8.  Reporting the Metric

   The metric reports loss of connectivity of monitored sub-path or
   congestion of an interface and identifies the sub-path and the
   direction of traffic in the case of congestion.

   The temporal resolution of the detected events depends on the spacing
   interval of packets transmitted per measurement path.  An identical
   sending interval is chosen for every measurement path.  As a rule of
   thumb, an event is reliably detected if a sample consists of at least
   5 probes indicating the same underlying change in behavior.
   Depending on the underlying event either two or three measurement
   paths are impacted.  At least two consecutively received measurement
   packets per measurement path should suffice to indicate a change.
   The values chosen for an operational network will have to reflect
   scalability constraints of a PMS measurement interface.  As an
   example, a PMS may work reliable if no more than one measurement
   packet is transmitted per millisecond.  Further, measurement is
   configured so that the measurement packets return to the sender
   interface.  Assume always groups of 6 links to be monitored as
   described above by 6 measurements paths.  If one packet is sent per
   measurement path within 500 ms, up to 498 links can be monitored with
   a reliable temporal resolution of roughly one second per detected
   event.

   Note that per group measurement packet spacing, measurement loop
   delay difference and latency caused by congestion impact the
   reporting interval.  If each measurement path of a single 6 link
   monitoring group is addressed in consecutive milliseconds (within the
   500 ms interval) and the sum of maximum physical delay of the per
   group measurement paths and latency possibly added by congestion is
   below 490 ms, the one second reports reliably capture 4 packets of
   two different measurement paths, if two measurement paths are
   congested, or 6 packets of three different measurement paths, if a
   link is lost.

   A variety of reporting options exist, if scalability issues and
   network properties are respected.

4.  Singleton Definition for Type-P-SR-Path-Round-Trip-Delay-Estimate

   This section will be added in a later version, if there's interest in
   picking up this work.

5.  IANA Considerations

   If standardised, the metric will require an entry in the IPPM metric
   registry.

6.  Security Considerations

   This draft specifies how to use methods specified or described within
   [RFC8402] and [RFC8403].  It does not introduce new or additional SR
   features.  The security considerations of both references apply here
   too.
