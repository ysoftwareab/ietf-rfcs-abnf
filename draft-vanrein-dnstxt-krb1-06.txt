         Declaring Kerberos Realm Names in DNS (_kerberos TXT)
                      draft-vanrein-dnstxt-krb1-06

Abstract

   This specification defines a method to determine Kerberos realm names
   for services that are known by their DNS name.  Currently, such
   information can only be found in static mappings or through educated
   guesswork.  DNS can make this process more flexible, provided that
   DNSSEC is used to ensure authenticity of resource records.

1.  Introduction

   When a Kerberos client contacts a service, it needs to obtain a
   service ticket, and for that it needs to contact the KDC for a realm
   under which the service is run.  To map a service name into a realm
   name and then into a KDC, clients tend to use static mappings or
   educated guessing; the client's KDC may or may not be involved in
   this process.  Through DNS, the static mappings could be made more
   dynamic, and be moved from local client configuration into the hands
   of the party administrating a server's presence in DNS.  This permits
   more flexibility than under the current practice.

   Two mappings are needed for the given scenario.  One is a mapping
   from the FQDN of a service to its realm name; the other is a mapping
   from the realm name to the Kerberos-specific services such as the
   KDC.  The latter mapping is published in SRV records [RFC4120] and
   such traffic is protected by the Kerberos protocol itself.  The first
   mapping however, has hitherto not been standardised and is ill-
   advised over unsecured DNS because the published information is then
   neither validated by DNS nor does it lead to a protocol that could
   provide end-to-end validation for it.

   With the recent uprise of DNSSEC, it is now possible to make a
   reliable judgement on the authenticity of data in DNS, which enables
   the standardisation of the first mapping in the form of resource
   records under DNSSEC.

   This specification defines how to publish and process Kerberos realm
   names using a hitherto non-standardised use of TXT resource records.
   These records hold a case-sensitive string with the realm name.
   Multiple TXT records may be defined as alternatives in contexts that

   welcome this; they suggest iterating over them until a ticket can be
   procured.

   It is suggested to use the name "_kerberos TXT" to informally refer
   to the style of using DNS that is introduced in this specification.

2.  Defining _kerberos TXT Resource Records

   This specification uses the TXT resource record type in DNS to
   represent one or more Kerberos realm names.  The corresponding RDATA
   format is as follows:

   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
   /                   REALMNAME                   /
   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

   The REALMNAME is represented as a <character-string> [RFC1035] which
   starts with a single-byte length, followed by as many bytes of realm
   name as the length byte's value.  The RDATA field therefore has a
   length of 1 up to 256 bytes, to hold a realm name of 0 up to 255
   bytes.  For instance, a realm EXAMPLE.ORG would be represented with
   the same RDATA as the following generic RDATA section that is also
   used for unkonwn resource record types [RFC3597]:

   \# 12 ( 0b 45 58 41 4d 50 4c 45 2e 4f 52 47 )

   The REALMNAME represents a Kerberos realm name, not a DNS name;
   invalid names MUST be ignored.  The empty string is considered an
   invalid REALMNAME, and it should be noted that a REALMNAME may exceed
   the size constraints of a DNS name.  The Kerberos realm name MUST NOT
   have an additional trailing dot unless it is actually part of the
   Kerberos realm name.  The realm name is never relative to the DNS
   name at which the TXT record was found.  Finally, there is no
   required relationship (such as partial overlap) between the realm
   name and the DNS name at which the TXT record was found.

   The TXT record can hold one or more <character-string> values in an
   ordered sequence, and implementations of this specification MUST NOT
   reject TXT records with multiple <character-string>s.  This
   specification only describes the meaning of the first <character-
   string> as a REALMNAME, and leaves the interpretation of further
   <character-string>s to future specifications.  Until these
   specifications are adopted, master zone files SHOULD NOT introduce
   these extra <character-string>s.  If such future specifications
   intend to not specify a realm name, then they can mention an invalid
   realm name such as an empty <character-string>.

   Realm names in Kerberos are often domain-styled [Section 6.1 of
   [RFC4120]], in which case they look like DNS names but are case
   sensitive; unlike the DNS names used as lookup keys in the DNS
   hierarchy, the REALMNAME format follows the <character-string> format
   in being case-sensitive.

   In fact, the <character-string> format is a binary format, and DNS
   notation \DDD [Section 5.1 of [RFC1035]] exists to put arbitrary
   bytes in the string notation.  This binary format leaves the door
   ajar for future internationalisation of Kerberos realm names.  Realm
   names are defined with the KerberosString type [Section 5.2.1 of
   [RFC4120]] which is an ASN.1 GeneralString, but its specification
   currently advises to constrain the use of this string type to an
   IA5String (basically using only the first 128 codes of the ASCII
   table) to avoid interoperability problems.  After the <character-
   string>'s length byte, the REALMNAME holds the value of the
   GeneralString, but not the corresponding ASN.1 tag and length.

   It is worth noting that the ESC "%" "G" prefix [TODO:xref
   target="ISO2022"/] can be used to introduce an UTF8String in a
   GeneralString, and that implementations exist that insert UTF8String
   values in KerberosString fields without even that escape.  All this
   precedes formal standardisation of internationalisation, but it
   suggests that the RDATA definition for TXT can be supportive of
   future internationalisation of realm names, even if its current
   advised use is limited to the value of an IA5String.

   The format for the resource data in master zone files is standard for
   DNS [RFC1035].  The TXT record is a general record and was not
   especially designed for this purpose.  The reason to use it
   nonetheless is that too many middle boxes suppress unknown DNS
   resource record types; we distinguish the particular use specified
   here by always prefixing a fixed _kerberos label to the DNS name that
   is being investigated.  An example declaration of realm name
   EXAMPLE.ORG for a server named imap.example.org would be:

   _kerberos.imap.example.org.  IN TXT  "EXAMPLE.ORG"

   The RDATA for this TXT record has already been shown above, in the
   generic RDATA section notation.

   As an alternative, the IMAP server may be specified through SRV
   records [RFC2782], in which case the domain holding those records
   needs to hold the TXT record, rather than the pointed-to server name,
   for example:

   _imap._tcp.example.org.  IN SRV  10 10 143  imap.example.org.
   _kerberos.example.org.   IN TXT  "EXAMPLE.ORG"

Internet-Draft                _kerberos TXT                 October 2015


   In operational contexts where both the SRV record resolution as the
   direct host name may be applied, it is also possible to define both
   kinds of TXT records; it depends on the application and its
   configuration in which single location it will look for the Kerberos
   realm name.

   Multiple TXT records may be supplied for the same _kerberos-prefixed
   DNS name; these represent alternatives that can be tried by the DNS
   client.  Since DNS delivers the resource records as a set without any
   particular order, the DNS client can choose freely in what order to
   process these records.

   It is possible to create a TXT record for any _kerberos-prefixed DNS
   name, but this specification only provides query procedures for host
   names and domain names.  The use with a domain name has the
   additional use of denoting the precise spelling for a realm name
   under its DNS-mapped name.  DNS-mapped names currently would not
   modify more than the case of a DNS name, and even that is only done
   as the result of DNS compression [RFC4343]; but in a future with
   internationalised realm names there might be more to guess, in which
   case this facility is likely to be helpful.  Since TXT records in
   general pose no constraints on the relation between the contained
   realm name and the DNS name at which it is found, it may be useful
   for mapping of DNS name to a Kerberos realm name to map the realm
   name back to a DNS name and compare the result.

3.  Querying Kerberos Realm Names

   This sections defines a procedure for finding Kerberos realm names
   for the servers, as well as for a DNS-mapped realm name.

   When applications directly know their server host name, perhaps
   because it is mentioned in a URL or in a ticket as a service
   principal name, they will lookup the TXT record at the server host
   name, prefixed with a _kerberos label.

   When applications locate their servers through a domain name, for
   example via MX [RFC1035] or SRV records [RFC2782], a choice between
   the use of the domain name or the appointed server host names is to
   be made.  In these situations, the TXT query MUST use only the domain
   name, without adding prefixes such as _Service._Proto for SRV
   records, but with an additional label _kerberos prefixed.  The
   appointed servers for a domain service MUST NOT be used to locate TXT
   records, since these may reside under operational control foreign to
   the service domain.  In addition, their possible shared use by many
   domains would mean that they may have to specify many alternatives,
   where it is not even certain that clients will be able to process
   more than one such alternative.  The domain name is closer to the

   client's context and provides a better-targeted location for the TXT
   record.

   Since DNS in general cannot be considered secure, the client MUST
   validate DNSSEC and it MUST dismiss any DNS responses that are
   Insecure, Bogus or Indeterminate [Section 5 of [RFC4033]].  Only the
   remaining Secure responses are to be taken into account.  This
   specification does not require that the client validates the
   responses by itself, but a client deployment SHOULD NOT accept DNS
   responses from a trusted validating DNS resolver over untrusted
   communication channels.

   To give one possible implementation, a Kerberos client or its KDC may
   send DNS queries with the Authentic Data (AD) bit set to enable
   DNSSEC [Section 5.7 of [RFC6840]], and thereby request that the
   Authenticated Data bit is set in the response to indicate [RFC3655]
   the Secure state for answer and authority sections of the response.
   When the DNS traffic to and from the validating resolver is
   protected, for instance because the validating resolver is reached
   over a loopback interface, then the Kerberos client or its KDC has
   implemented the requirements for Secure use of the answer and
   authority sections in DNS responses.

   When no Secure DNS responses are received when the DNS query times
   out, then the TXT query MUST be terminated without extracting realm
   names from DNS.  This termination MAY be done immediately upon
   receiving Secure denial for the requested TXT record.  TXT query
   termination need not be fatal; non-DNS procedures may exist to find a
   realm name, including the current practice of static mappings and
   educated guessing.

4.  Publishing Kerberos Realm Names

   TXT records should generally be published at the domain names and
   server host names that a Kerberos application may want to approach.
   Their location is prefixed with an extra _kerberos label to
   distinguish the specific use of the TXT record defined herein.

   As an exception to this general rule, server host names may be
   exempted if they are always looked up through a domain name.  Note
   however, that most query mechanisms that lookup domain names through
   special resource record types have fallbacks to plain server host
   name lookups.  When such direct server host names are supported in a
   deployment of those applications, usually meaning that these server
   host names may occur in Kerberos service principal names, and when
   the realm name cannot be detected through a preferred mechanism for
   such server host names, then an additional TXT record located at the
   server name is also going to be helpful.

Internet-Draft                _kerberos TXT                 October 2015


   There may be situations where a domain represents a Kerberos realm,
   but uses domain-style references such as MX and SRV records to point
   to foreign server host names.  Such foreign server host names are
   often unsuitable to accompany with a TXT record, so it is advisable
   to either not refer to the server host names directly in service
   tickets, or to see to it that a realm name is always attached by the
   KDC.

   These instructions are somewhat flexible, as a result of the pre-
   existing static mechanisms for finding a realm name for a given
   service principal name.  Assuming that the more flexible approach of
   TXT records is preferred, a useful functionality test would be to
   access the targeted applications from Kerberos clients without static
   configuration.

   Zones that intend to provide applications with Kerberos realm names
   through TXT records MUST be protected by DNSSEC to make them usable
   to those applications.

   Note that TXT records with wildcard names will not work.  All host
   names and most domain names define at least one resource record (of
   any type) with the name that the wildcard should cover.  These
   defined names cause the wildcards to be suppressed [RFC4592] from DNS
   responses, even when querying a non-existent TXT record.

5.  Efficiency Considerations

   TXT records are intended to define realm names for servers whose DNS
   information is not statically mapped in a Kerberos setup.  This may
   simplify operational control of such static mappings.  It may also
   introduce more dynamicity, which is exptected to be useful for such
   things as realm crossover.

   The lookup of TXT records can be done by the Ticket Granting Service
   of a KDC, which can respond with a Server Referral [Section 8 of
   [RFC6806]] to Kerberos clients that enable canonicalization.  This
   can be used for clients that are not setup to query DNS as specified
   above, and that will assume that a service is running under the
   client's realm.  The cached DNS records, their validation and
   possibly realm-crossover caching at the KDC can all benefit the
   response time for future lookups by other Kerberos clients.

   The use of TXT records helps the Kerberos client and/or its KDC to
   focus on the realm for which a service ought to have a name defined.
   This generally provides a clearer path, with less guessing.

   The definition of TXT records under a domain rather than under a
   server host name (for cases where a choice exists, such as for



Van Rein                  Expires April 4, 2016                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                _kerberos TXT                 October 2015


   applications that use SRV or MX records) should limit the choice of
   realm names, because the domain is not farther away from the client's
   domain/realm than the server host name.

   Constraining the number of paths to a target realm to one is
   especially useful for situations with realm crossover when this
   involves public-key cryptography, because such algorithms are much
   slower than the symmetric algorithms that are normally used for
   Kerberos.

6.  Privacy Considerations

   The information contained in a TXT record for a domain is barely more
   than the domain's DNS name already holds; the TXT record spells out
   the case-sensitive realm name, and implies the use of Kerberos.  The
   use of Kerberos is usually also implied by the presence of certain
   SRV records.

   The TXT records also marks the names of Kerberised servers.  Internal
   use may prohibit such disclosure, but in those use cases it is often
   possible to rely on existing mechanisms for guessing a realm name,
   including simply using the realm name under which a client logged on
   with Kerberos.

7.  Security Considerations

   There is no restriction for TXT records to mention realm names that
   map back to DNS names in a disjoint part of the DNS hierarcy.  The
   records could therefore specify realm names for a service even if the
   service is not recognised by the realm.  The KDC for the appointed
   realm would be very clear about that when trying to procure a service
   ticket, so there is no security issue with such misguided use of TXT
   records.

   The general point is that the use of DNSSEC makes Kerberos rely on
   the party that publishes the TXT record, and that party could specify
   improper realm names or drop realm names that are vital to the
   client.  This is not expected to be a security risk either; the party
   publishing the TXT record is the same party that publishes the
   service's records, namely the DNS operator.  By publishing the
   service's record in DNS, this operator already has potential control
   over service denial and other man-in-the-middle attacks, so the TXT
   record does not add any new abusive powers.

   When an external attacker would be permitted to spoof a TXT record in
   a victim's DNS, then it could be possible for that attacker to
   convince the client that the attacker is the authentic provider for
   the service.  Additional spoofing of host name references could then

   complete the attack.  This has been mitigated by strictly requiring
   Secure validation results from a DNSSEC-aware resolver for all TXT
   records.
