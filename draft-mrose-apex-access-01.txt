1. Introduction

   This memo describes a access service that is built upon the APEX[1]
   "relaying mesh". The APEX access service is used to control use of
   both the relaying mesh and other APEX services.

   APEX, at its core, provides a best-effort datagram service. Although
   additional APEX services are co-resident with each relay within an
   administrative domain, they are logically provided on top of the
   relaying mesh, i.e.,

      +----------+     +----------+    +----------+    +---------+
      |   APEX   |     |   APEX   |    |   APEX   |    |         |
      |  access  |     | presence |    |  report  |    |   ...   |
      | service  |     |  service |    | service  |    |         |
      +----------+     +----------+    +----------+    +---------+
           |                |               |               |
           |                |               |               |
   +----------------------------------------------------------------+
   |                                                                |
   |                            APEX core                           |
   |                                                                |
   +----------------------------------------------------------------+

   That is, applications communicate with an APEX service by exchanging
   data with a "well-known endpoint" (WKE).

   APEX applications communicate with the access service by exchanging
   data with the well-known endpoint "apex=access" in the corresponding
   administrative domain, e.g., "apex=access@example.com" is the
   endpoint associated with the access service in the "example.com"
   administrative domain.

   Note that within a single administrative domain, the relaying mesh
   makes use of the APEX access service in order to determine if an
   originator is allowed to transmit data to a recipient (c.f., Step 5.3
   of Section 4.4.4.1 of [1]).

2. Management of Access Information

   Management of access information falls into two categories:

   o  applications may retrieve the access entry associated with an
      endpoint; and,

   o  applications may modify the access entry associated with an
      endpoint.

   Each is now described in turn.

2.1 Retrieval of Access Information

   When an application wants to retrieve the access entry associated
   with an endpoint, it sends a "get" element to the service, e.g.,

       +-------+                  +-------+
       |       | -- data -------> |       |
       | appl. |                  | relay |
       |       | <--------- ok -- |       |
       +-------+                  +-------+

     C: <data content='#Content'>
            <originator identity='fred@example.com' />
            <recipient identity='apex=access@example.com' />
            <data-content Name='Content'>
                <get owner='fred@example.com' transID='1' />
            </data-content>
        </data>
     S: <ok />

   The service immediately responds with a set operation containing the
   access entry and the same transaction-identifier, e.g.,

                                  +-------+                  +-------+
                                  |       | <------- data -- |       |
                                  | relay |                  |access |
                                  |       | -- ok ---------> |  svc. |
                                  +-------+                  +-------+

     C: <data content='#Content'>
            <originator identity='apex=access@example.com' />
            <recipient identity='fred@example.com' />
            <data-content Name='Content'>
                <set owner='fred@example.com' transID='1'
                    timeStamp='14 May 2000 13:32:00 -0800'>
                    <access owner='fred@example.com'
                            lastUpdate='14 May 2000 13:02:00 -0800'>
                        <entry actor='*@example.com'
                               actions='core:data presence:subscribe' />
                        <entry actor='*@*' actions='core:data' />
                    </access>
                </set>
            </data-content>
        </data>
     S: <ok />

2.2 Update of Access Information

   When an application wants to modify the access entry associated with
   an endpoint, it sends a "set" element to the service, e.g.,

       +-------+                  +-------+
       |       | -- data -------> |       |
       | appl. |                  | relay |
       |       | <--------- ok -- |       |
       +-------+                  +-------+

     C: <data content='#Content'>
            <originator identity='fred@example.com' />
            <recipient identity='apex=access@example.com' />
            <data-content Name='Content'>
                <set owner='fred@example.com' transID='1'
                    timeStamp='14 May 2000 13:32:00 -0800'> ... </set>
            </data-content>
        </data>
     S: <ok />

   The service immediately responds with a reply operation containing
   the same transaction-identifier, e.g.,

                                  +-------+                  +-------+
                                  |       | <------- data -- |       |
                                  | relay |                  |access |
                                  |       | -- ok ---------> |  svc. |
                                  +-------+                  +-------+

     C: <data content='#Content'>
            <originator identity='apex=access@example.com' />
            <recipient identity='fred@example.com' />
            <data-content Name='Content'>
                <reply code='250' transID='1' />
            </data-content>
        </data>
     S: <ok />

   Note that Step 5 of Section 4.3 requires that the "lastUpdate"
   attribute of an access entry be supplied in order to update that
   entry; accordingly, applications must successfully retrieve an access
   entry prior to trying to update that entry.

3. Format of Access Entries

   Each administrative domain is responsible for maintaining an "access
   entry" for each of its endpoints (regardless of whether those
   endpoints are currently attached to the relaying mesh).

   Section 6 defines the syntax for access entries. Each access entry
   has an "owner" attribute, a "lastUpdate" attribute, and contains one
   or more "entry" elements:

   o  the "owner" attribute specifies the endpoint associated with the
      access entry;

   o  the "lastUpdate" attribute specifies the date and time that the
      service last updated the access entry; and,

   o  each "entry" element specifies, with respect to the owner's
      endpoint, an actor and zero or more allowed actions for that
      actor.

   Within an entry, actions are specified as service/operation pairs,
   (e.g., "presence:publish" refers to the "publish" operation of the
   "presence" service). To refer to all services and/or all operations,
   the reserved value "all" is used (e.g., "all:data", "presence:all",
   and so on). Note that the service specified as "core" is reserved for
   use by the relaying mesh, e.g., the "core:data" action is consulted
   by the relaying mesh (c.f., Step 3.3 of Section 4.4.3.1 of [1]).

   An actor is an APEX endpoint and is specified using the "addr-spec"
   syntax specified in Section 3.4.1 of [2], i.e., the familiar
   "local@domain" syntax. However, both the "local" and "domain" parts
   may contain limited wildcarding:

   o  The "local" part is either:

      *  a literal string (e.g., "fred"); or,

      *  the value "apex=*", specifying all APEX services; or,

      *  the value "*", specifying any endpoint other than an APEX
         service.

   o  The "domain" part is either:

      *  a FQDN (e.g., "example.com"); or,

      *  the value "*", specifying all administrative domains.

Internet-Draft           The APEX Access Service           December 2000


   Regardless of the "entry" elements present in an access entry, four
   additional elements are always considered to exist at the end of the
   access entry:

     <entry actor='apex=*@domain' actions='all:all' />
     <entry actor='apex=*@*'      actions='core:data' />
     <entry actor='local@domain'  actions='all:all' />
     <entry actor='*@*'           actions='' />

   where "local@domain" specifies the endpoint associated with the
   access entry.

   Ordering of "entry" elements within an access element is significant:
   a process examining an access element selects the first "entry"
   element that matches the actor in question. For example, consider
   this access entry:

       <access owner='fred@example.com'
               lastUpdate='14 May 2000 13:02:00 -0800'>
           <entry actor='wilma@example.com' actions='all:all' />
           <entry actor='mr.slate@example.com' actions='core:data' />
           <entry actor='*@example.com'
                actions='core:data presence:subscribe presence:watch' />
           <entry actor='*@*' actions='core:data' />
       </access>

   Briefly:

   o  For endpoints within the "example.com" administrative domain:

      *  "fred", "wilma", and all APEX services, are allowed access to
         all operations for all APEX services;

      *  "mr.slate" is allowed access only to send data through the
         relaying mesh; and,

      *  any other endpoint is allowed access to send data and invoke
         the "subscribe" and "watch" operations of the APEX presence
         service.

   o  For any endpoint outside the "example.com" administrative domain,
      the endpoint is allowed access to send data, regardless of whether
      it is an APEX service.

   Note that although the four additional elements are always present,
   the ordering semantics cause the final element to be unused.

4. The Access Service

   Section 5 contains the APEX service registration for the access
   service:

   o  Within an administrative domain, the service is addressed using
      the well-known endpoint of "apex=access".

   o  Section 6 defines the syntax of the operations exchanged with the
      service.

   o  A consumer of the service initiates communications by sending data
      containing either the get or set operation.

   o  The service replies to these operations, and does not initiate
      communications.

   An implementation of the service must maintain information about
   access entries in persistent storage.

   Consult Section 6.1.1 of [1] for a discussion on the properties of
   long-lived transaction-identifiers.

4.1 Use of XML and MIME

   Section 4.1 of [1] describes how arbitrary MIME content is exchanged
   as a BEEP[3] payload. For example, to transmit:

       <data content='...'>
           <originator identity='fred@example.com' />
           <recipient identity='apex=access@example.com' />
       </data>

   where "..." refers to: <get owner='fred@example.com' transID='1' />

   then the corresponding BEEP message might look like this:

       C: MSG 1 2 . 42 1234
       C: Content-Type: multipart/related; boundary="boundary";
       C:               start="<1@example.com>";
       C:               type="application/beep+xml"
       C:
       C: --boundary
       C: Content-Type: application/beep+xml
       C: Content-ID: <1@example.com>
       C:
       C: <data content='cid:2@example.com'>
       C:     <originator identity='fred@example.com' />
       C:     <recipient identity='apex=access@example.com' />
       C: </data>
       C: --boundary
       C: Content-Type: application/beep+xml
       C: Content-ID: <2@example.com>
       C:
       C: <get owner='fred@example.com' transID='1' />
       C: --boundary--
       C: END

   or this:

       C: MSG 1 1 . 42 267
       C: Content-Type: application/beep+xml
       C:
       C: <data content='#Content'>
       C:     <originator identity='fred@example.com' />
       C:     <recipient identity='apex=access@example.com' />
       C:     <data-content Name='Content'>
       C:         <get owner='fred@example.com' transID='1' />
       C:     </data-content>
       C: </data>
       C: END

4.2 The Get Operation

   When an application wants to retrieve the access entry associated
   with an endpoint, it sends a "get" element to the service.

   The "get" element has an "owner" attribute, a "transID" attribute,
   and no content:

   o  the "owner" attribute specifies the endpoint associated with the
      access entry; and,

   o  the "transID" attribute specifies the transaction-identifier
      associated with this operation.

   When the service receives a "get" element, we refer to the "owner"
   attribute of that element as the "subject", and the service performs
   these steps:

   1.  If the subject is outside of this administrative domain, a
       "reply" element having code 553 is sent to the originator.

   2.  If the subject does not refer to a valid endpoint, a "reply"
       element having code 550 is sent to the originator.

   3.  If the subject's access entry does not contain a "access:get"
       token for the originator, a "reply" element having code 537 is
       sent to the originator.

   4.  Otherwise, a "set" element, corresponding to the subject's access
       entry, is sent to the originator.

   Regardless of whether a "set" or "reply" element is sent to the
   originator, the "transID" attribute is identical to the value found
   in the "get" element sent by the originator.

4.3 The Set Operation

   When an application wants to modify the access entry associated with
   an endpoint, it sends a "set" element to the service.

   The "set" element has an "owner" attribute, a "transID" attribute, a
   "timeStamp" attribute, and contains an "access" element:

   o  the "owner" attribute specifies the endpoint to be associated with
      the access entry;

   o  the "transID" attribute specifies the transaction-identifier
      associated with this operation;

   o  the "timeStamp" attribute specifies the application's notion of
      the current date and time; and,

   o  the "access" element contains the desired access entry for the
      endpoint.

   When the service receives a "set" element, we refer to the "owner"
   attribute of that element as the "subject", and the service performs
   these steps:

   1.  If the "owner" attribute of the "set" element doesn't match the
       "owner" attribute of the "access" element contained in the "set"
       element, a "reply" element having code 503 is sent to the
       originator.

   2.  If the subject is outside of this administrative domain, a
       "reply" element having code 553 is sent to the originator.

   3.  If the subject does not refer to a valid endpoint, a "reply"
       element having code 550 is sent to the originator.

   4.  If the subject's access entry does not contain a "access:set"
       token for the originator, a "reply" element having code 537 is
       sent to the originator.

   5.  If the "lastUpdate" attribute of the "set" element is not
       semantically identical to the "lastUpdate" attribute of the
       subject's access entry, a "reply" element having code 555 is sent
       to the originator. (This allows a basic mechanism for atomic
       updates.)

   6.  Otherwise:

       1.  The subject's access entry is updated from the "set" element.

       2.  The "lastUpdate" attribute of the access entry is set to the
           service's notion of the current date time.

       3.  A "reply" element having code 250 is sent to the originator.

   When sending the "reply" element, the "transID" attribute is
   identical to the value found in the "set" element sent by the
   originator.

4.4 The Reply Operation

   While processing operations, the service may respond with a "reply"
   element. Consult Sections 10.2 and 6.1.2 of [1], respectively, for
   the syntax and semantics of the reply operation.
