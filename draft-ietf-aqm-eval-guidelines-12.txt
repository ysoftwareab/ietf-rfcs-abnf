Abstract

   Unmanaged large buffers in today's networks have given rise to a slew
   of performance issues.  These performance issues can be addressed by
   some form of Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanism, optionally in
   combination with a packet scheduling scheme such as fair queuing.
   This document describes various criteria for performing
   characterizations of AQM schemes, that can be used in lab testing
   during development, prior to deployment.

1.  Introduction

   Active Queue Management (AQM) addresses the concerns arising from
   using unnecessarily large and unmanaged buffers to improve network
   and application performance, such as presented in the section 1.2 of
   the AQM recommendations document [RFC7567].  Several AQM algorithms
   have been proposed in the past years, most notably Random Early
   Detection (RED), BLUE, and Proportional Integral controller (PI), and
   more recently CoDel [I-D.ietf-aqm-codel] and PIE [I-D.ietf-aqm-pie].
   In general, these algorithms actively interact with the Transmission
   Control Protocol (TCP) and any other transport protocol that deploys
   a congestion control scheme to manage the amount of data they keep in

   the network.  The available buffer space in the routers and switches
   should be large enough to accommodate the short-term buffering
   requirements.  AQM schemes aim at reducing buffer occupancy, and
   therefore the end-to-end delay.  Some of these algorithms, notably
   RED, have also been widely implemented in some network devices.
   However, the potential benefits of the RED scheme have not been
   realized since RED is reported to be usually turned off.

   A buffer is a physical volume of memory in which a queue or set of
   queues are stored.  When speaking of a specific queue in this
   document, "buffer occupancy" refers to the amount of data (measured
   in bytes or packets) that are in the queue, and the "maximum buffer
   size" refers to the maximum buffer occupancy.  In switches and
   routers, a global memory space is often shared between the available
   interfaces, and thus, the maximum buffer size for any given interface
   may vary over the time.

   Bufferbloat [BB2011] is the consequence of deploying large unmanaged
   buffers on the Internet -- the buffering has often been measured to
   be ten times or hundred times larger than needed.  Large buffer sizes
   in combination with TCP and/or unresponsive flows increases end-to-
   end delay.  This results in poor performance for latency-sensitive
   applications such as real-time multimedia (e.g., voice, video,
   gaming, etc).  The degree to which this affects modern networking
   equipment, especially consumer-grade equipment's, produces problems
   even with commonly used web services.  Active queue management is
   thus essential to control queuing delay and decrease network latency.

   The Active Queue Management and Packet Scheduling Working Group (AQM
   WG) was chartered to address the problems with large unmanaged
   buffers in the Internet.  Specifically, the AQM WG is tasked with
   standardizing AQM schemes that not only address concerns with such
   buffers, but also are robust under a wide variety of operating
   conditions.  This document provides characterization guidelines that
   can be used to assess the applicability, performance and
   deployability of an AQM, whether it is candidate for standardization
   at IETF or not.

   AQM algorithm implemented in a router can be separated from the
   scheduling of packets sent out by the router as discussed in the AQM
   recommendations document [RFC7567].  The rest of this memo refers to
   the AQM as a dropping/marking policy as a separate feature to any
   interface scheduling scheme.  This document may be complemented with
   another one on guidelines for assessing combination of packet
   scheduling and AQM.  We note that such a document will inherit all
   the guidelines from this document plus any additional scenarios
   relevant for packet scheduling such as flow starvation evaluation or
   impact of the number of hash buckets.

1.1.  Reducing the latency and maximizing the goodput

   The trade-off between reducing the latency and maximizing the goodput
   is intrinsically linked to each AQM scheme and is key to evaluating
   its performance.  To ensure the safety deployment of an AQM, its
   behaviour should be assessed in a variety of scenarios.  Whenever
   possible, solutions ought to aim at both maximizing goodput and
   minimizing latency.

1.2.  Goals of this document

   This document recommends a generic list of scenarios against which an
   AQM proposal should be evaluated, considering both potential
   performance gain and safety of deployment.  The guidelines help to
   quantify performance of AQM schemes in terms of latency reduction,
   goodput maximization and the trade-off between these two.  The
   document presents central aspects of an AQM algorithm that should be
   considered whatever the context, such as burst absorption capacity,
   RTT fairness or resilience to fluctuating network conditions.  The
   guidelines also discuss methods to understand the various aspects
   associated with safely deploying and operating the AQM scheme.  Thus,
   one of the key objectives behind formulating the guidelines is to
   help ascertain whether a specific AQM is not only better than drop-
   tail (i.e. without AQM and with a BDP-sized buffer) but also safe to
   deploy: the guidelines can be used to compare several AQM proposals
   with each other, but should be used to compare a proposal with drop-
   tail.

   This memo details generic characterization scenarios against which
   any AQM proposal should be evaluated, irrespective of whether or not
   an AQM is standardized by the IETF.  This documents recommends the
   relevant scenarios and metrics to be considered.  The document
   presents central aspects of an AQM algorithm that should be
   considered whatever the context, such as burst absorption capacity,
   RTT fairness or resilience to fluctuating network conditions.

   These guidelines do not define and are not bound to a particular
   deployment scenario or evaluation toolset.  Instead the guidelines
   can be used to assert the potential gain of introducing an AQM for
   the particular environment, which is of interest to the testers.
   These guidelines do not cover every possible aspect of a particular
   algorithm.  These guidelines do not present context-dependent
   scenarios (such as 802.11 WLANs, data-centers or rural broadband
   networks).  To keep the guidelines generic, a number of potential
   router components and algorithms (such as DiffServ) are omitted.

   The goals of this document can thus be summarized as follows:

   o  The present characterization guidelines provide a non-exhaustive
      list of scenarios to help ascertain whether an AQM is not only
      better than drop-tail (with a BDP-sized buffer), but also safe to
      deploy; the guidelines can also be used to compare several AQM
      proposals with each other.

   o  The present characterization guidelines (1) are not bound to a
      particular evaluation toolset and (2) can be used for various
      deployment contexts; testers are free to select a toolset that is
      best suited for the environment in which their proposal will be
      deployed.

   o  The present characterization guidelines are intended to provide
      guidance for better selecting an AQM for a specific environment;
      it is not required that an AQM proposal is evaluated following
      these guidelines for its standardization.

1.3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.4.  Glossary

   o  application-limited traffic: a type of traffic that does not have
      an unlimited amount of data to transmit.

   o  AQM: the Active Queue Managment (AQM) algorithm implemented in a
      router can be separated from the scheduling of packets sent by the
      router.  The rest of this memo refers to the AQM as a dropping/
      marking policy as a separate feature to any interface scheduling
      scheme [RFC7567].

   o  BDP: Bandwidth Delay Product.

   o  buffer: a physical volume of memory in which a queue or set of
      queues are stored.

   o  buffer occupancy: amount of data that are stored in a buffer,
      measured in bytes or packets.

   o  buffer size: maximum buffer occupancy, that is the maximum amount
      of data that may be stored in a buffer, measured in bytes or
      packets.

   o  IW10: TCP initial congestion window set to 10 packets.

   o  latency: one-way delay of packets across Internet paths.  This
      definition suits transport layer definition of the latency, that
      shall not be confused with an application layer view of the
      latency.

   o  goodput: goodput is defined as the number of bits per unit of time
      forwarded to the correct destination minus any bits lost or
      retransmitted [RFC2647].  The goodput should be determined for
      each flow and not for aggregates of flows.

   o  SQRT: the square root function.

   o  ROUND: the round function.

2.  End-to-end metrics

   End-to-end delay is the result of propagation delay, serialization
   delay, service delay in a switch, medium-access delay and queuing
   delay, summed over the network elements along the path.  AQM schemes
   may reduce the queuing delay by providing signals to the sender on
   the emergence of congestion, but any impact on the goodput must be
   carefully considered.  This section presents the metrics that could
   be used to better quantify (1) the reduction of latency, (2)
   maximization of goodput and (3) the trade-off between these two.
   This section provides normative requirements for metrics that can be
   used to assess the performance of an AQM scheme.

   Some metrics listed in this section are not suited to every type of
   traffic detailed in the rest of this document.  It is therefore not
   necessary to measure all of the following metrics: the chosen metric
   may not be relevant to the context of the evaluation scenario (e.g.,
   latency vs. goodput trade-off in application-limited traffic
   scenarios).  Guidance is provided for each metric.

2.1.  Flow completion time

   The flow completion time is an important performance metric for the
   end-user when the flow size is finite.  The definition of the flow
   size may be source of contradictions, thus, this metric can consider
   a flow as a single file.  Considering the fact that an AQM scheme may
   drop/mark packets, the flow completion time is directly linked to the
   dropping/marking policy of the AQM scheme.  This metric helps to
   better assess the performance of an AQM depending on the flow size.
   The Flow Completion Time (FCT) is related to the flow size (Fs) and
   the goodput for the flow (G) as follows:

   FCT [s] = Fs [Byte] / ( G [Bit/s] / 8 [Bit/Byte] )




Kuhn, et al.            Expires December 12, 2016               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft       AQM Characterization Guidelines           June 2016


   Where flow size is the size of the application-level flow in bits and
   goodput is the application-level transfer time (described in
   Section 2.5).

   If this metric is used to evaluate the performance of web transfers,
   it is suggested to rather consider the time needed to download all
   the objects that compose the web page, as this makes more sense in
   terms of user experience than assessing the time needed to download
   each object.

2.2.  Flow start up time

   The flow start up time is the time between the request has been sent
   from the client and the server starts to transmit data.  The amount
   of packets dropped by an AQM may seriously affect the waiting period
   during which the data transfer has not started.  This metric would
   specifically focus on the operations such as DNS lookups, TCP opens
   and SSL handshakes.

2.3.  Packet loss

   Packet loss can occur en-route, this can impact the end-to-end
   performance measured at receiver.

   The tester should evaluate loss experienced at the receiver using one
   of the two metrics:

   o  the packet loss ratio: this metric is to be frequently measured
      during the experiment.  The long-term loss ratio is of interest
      for steady-state scenarios only;

   o  the interval between consecutive losses: the time between two
      losses is to be measured.

   The packet loss ratio can be assessed by simply evaluating the loss
   ratio as a function of the number of lost packets and the total
   number of packets sent.  This might not be easily done in laboratory
   testing, for which these guidelines advice the tester:

   o  to check that for every packet, a corresponding packet was
      received within a reasonable time, as presented in the document
      that proposes a metric for one-way packet loss across Internet
      paths [RFC2680].

   o  to keep a count of all packets sent, and a count of the non-
      duplicate packets received, as discussed in RFC that presents a
      benchmarking methodology [RFC2544].

Internet-Draft       AQM Characterization Guidelines           June 2016


   The interval between consecutive losses, which is also called a gap,
   is a metric of interest for VoIP traffic [RFC3611].

2.4.  Packet loss synchronization

   One goal of an AQM algorithm is to help to avoid global
   synchronization of flows sharing a bottleneck buffer on which the AQM
   operates ([RFC2309],[RFC7567]).  The "degree" of packet-loss
   synchronization between flows should be assessed, with and without
   the AQM under consideration.

   Loss synchronization among flows may be quantified by several
   slightly different metrics that capture different aspects of the same
   issue [HASS2008].  However, in real-world measurements the choice of
   metric could be imposed by practical considerations -- e.g., whether
   fine-grained information on packet losses at the bottleneck is
   available or not.  For the purpose of AQM characterization, a good
   candidate metric is the global synchronization ratio, measuring the
   proportion of flows losing packets during a loss event.  This metric
   can be used in real-world experiments to characterize synchronization
   along arbitrary Internet paths [JAY2006].

   If an AQM scheme is evaluated using real-life network environments,
   it is worth pointing out that some network events, such as failed
   link restoration may cause synchronized losses between active flows
   and thus confuse the meaning of this metric.

2.5.  Goodput

   The goodput has been defined as the number of bits per unit of time
   forwarded to the correct destination interface, minus any bits lost
   or retransmitted, such as proposed in the secton 3.17 of the RFC
   describing the benchmarking terminology for firewall performances
   [RFC2647].  This definition requires that the test setup needs to be
   qualified to assure that it is not generating losses on its own.

   Measuring the end-to-end goodput provides an appreciation of how well
   an AQM scheme improves transport and application performance.  The
   measured end-to-end goodput is linked to the dropping/marking policy
   of the AQM scheme -- e.g., the fewer the number of packet drops, the
   fewer packets need retransmission, minimizing the impact of AQM on
   transport and application performance.  Additionally, an AQM scheme
   may resort to Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) marking as an
   initial means to control delay.  Again, marking packets instead of
   dropping them reduces the number of packet retransmissions and
   increases goodput.  End-to-end goodput values help to evaluate the
   AQM scheme's effectiveness of an AQM scheme in minimizing packet

   drops that impact application performance and to estimate how well
   the AQM scheme works with ECN.

   The measurement of the goodput allows the tester to evaluate to which
   extent an AQM is able to maintain a high bottleneck utilization.
   This metric should also be obtained frequently during an experiment
   as the long-term goodput is relevant for steady-state scenarios only
   and may not necessarily reflect how the introduction of an AQM
   actually impacts the link utilization during at a certain period of
   time.  Fluctuations in the values obtained from these measurements
   may depend on other factors than the introduction of an AQM, such as
   link layer losses due to external noise or corruption, fluctuating
   bandwidths (802.11 WLANs), heavy congestion levels or transport
   layer's rate reduction by congestion control mechanism.

2.6.  Latency and jitter

   The latency, or the one-way delay metric, is discussed in [RFC2679].
   There is a consensus on an adequate metric for the jitter, that
   represents the one-way delay variations for packets from the same
   flow: the Packet Delay Variation (PDV) serves well all use cases
   [RFC5481].

   The end-to-end latency includes components other than just the
   queuing delay, such as the signal processing delay, transmission
   delay and the processing delay.  Moreover, the jitter is caused by
   variations in queuing and processing delay (e.g., scheduling
   effects).  The introduction of an AQM scheme would impact end-to-end
   latency and jitter, and therefore these metrics should be considered
   in the end-to-end evaluation of performance.

2.7.  Discussion on the trade-off between latency and goodput

   The metrics presented in this section may be considered in order to
   discuss and quantify the trade-off between latency and goodput.

   With regards to the goodput, and in addition to the long-term
   stationary goodput value, it is recommended to take measurements
   every multiple of the minimum RTT (minRTT) between A and B.  It is
   suggested to take measurements at least every K x minRTT (to smooth
   out the fluctuations), with K=10.  Higher values for K can be
   considered whenever it is more appropriate for the presentation of
   the results, since the value for K may depend on the network's path
   characteristics.  The measurement period must be disclosed for each
   experiment and when results/values are compared across different AQM
   schemes, the comparisons should use exactly the same measurement
   periods.  With regards to latency, it is recommended to take the
   samples on per-packet basis whenever possible depending on the

Internet-Draft       AQM Characterization Guidelines           June 2016


   features provided by hardware/software and the impact of sampling
   itself on the hardware performance.

   From each of these sets of measurements, the cumulative density
   function (CDF) of the considered metrics should be computed.  If the
   considered scenario introduces dynamically varying parameters,
   temporal evolution of the metrics could also be generated.  For each
   scenario, the following graph may be generated: the x-axis shows
   queuing delay (that is the average per-packet delay in excess of
   minimum RTT), the y-axis the goodput.  Ellipses are computed such as
   detailed in [WINS2014]: "We take each individual [...] run [...] as
   one point, and then compute the 1-epsilon elliptic contour of the
   maximum-likelihood 2D Gaussian distribution that explains the points.
   [...] we plot the median per-sender throughput and queueing delay as
   a circle. [...] The orientation of an ellipse represents the
   covariance between the throughput and delay measured for the
   protocol."  This graph provides part of a better understanding of (1)
   the delay/goodput trade-off for a given congestion control mechanism
   (Section 5), and (2) how the goodput and average queue delay vary as
   a function of the traffic load (Section 8.2).

3.  Generic setup for evaluations

   This section presents the topology that can be used for each of the
   following scenarios, the corresponding notations and discusses
   various assumptions that have been made in the document.

                     Figure 1: Topology and notations

   Figure 1 is a generic topology where:

   o  traffic profile is a set of flows with similar characteristics -
      RTT, congestion control scheme, transport protocol, etc.;

   o  senders with different traffic characteristics (i.e., traffic
      profiles) can be introduced;

   o  the timing of each flow could be different (i.e., when does each
      flow start and stop);

   o  each traffic profile can comprise various number of flows;

   o  each link is characterized by a couple (one-way delay, capacity);

   o  sender A_i is instantiated for each traffic profile.  A
      corresponding receiver B_i is instantiated for receiving the flows
      in the profile;




Kuhn, et al.            Expires December 12, 2016              [Page 12]

Internet-Draft       AQM Characterization Guidelines           June 2016


   o  flows sharing a bottleneck (the link between routers L and R);

   o  the tester should consider both scenarios of asymmetric and
      symmetric bottleneck links in terms of bandwidth.  In case of
      asymmetric link, the capacity from senders to receivers is higher
      than the one from receivers to senders; the symmetric link
      scenario provides a basic understanding of the operation of the
      AQM mechanism whereas the asymmetric link scenario evaluates an
      AQM mechanism in a more realistic setup;

   o  in asymmetric link scenarios, the tester should study the bi-
      directional traffic between A and B (downlink and uplink) with the
      AQM mechanism deployed on one direction only.  The tester may
      additionally consider a scenario with AQM mechanism being deployed
      on both directions.  In each scenario, the tester should
      investigate the impact of drop policy of the AQM on TCP ACK
      packets and its impact on the performance (Section 9.2).

   Although this topology may not perfectly reflect actual topologies,
   the simple topology is commonly used in the world of simulations and
   small testbeds.  It can be considered as adequate to evaluate AQM
   proposals [I-D.irtf-iccrg-tcpeval].  Testers ought to pay attention
   to the topology that has been used to evaluate an AQM scheme when
   comparing this scheme with a newly proposed AQM scheme.

3.2.  Buffer size

   The size of the buffers should be carefully chosen, and may be set to
   the bandwidth-delay product; the bandwidth being the bottleneck
   capacity and the delay the largest RTT in the considered network.
   The size of the buffer can impact the AQM performance and is a
   dimensioning parameter that will be considered when comparing AQM
   proposals.

   If a specific buffer size is required, the tester must justify and
   detail the way the maximum queue size is set.  Indeed, the maximum
   size of the buffer may affect the AQM's performance and its choice
   should be elaborated for a fair comparison between AQM proposals.
   While comparing AQM schemes the buffer size should remain the same
   across the tests.

3.3.  Congestion controls

   This document considers running three different congestion control
   algorithms between A and B

   o  Standard TCP congestion control: the base-line congestion control
      is TCP NewReno with SACK [RFC5681].



Kuhn, et al.            Expires December 12, 2016              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft       AQM Characterization Guidelines           June 2016


   o  Aggressive congestion controls: a base-line congestion control for
      this category is TCP Cubic [I-D.ietf-tcpm-cubic].

   o  Less-than Best Effort (LBE) congestion controls: an LBE congestion
      control 'results in smaller bandwidth and/or delay impact on
      standard TCP than standard TCP itself, when sharing a bottleneck
      with it.': a base-line congestion control for this category is
      LEDBAT [RFC6817].

   Other transport congestion controls can OPTIONALLY be evaluated in
   addition.  Recent transport layer protocols are not mentioned in the
   following sections, for the sake of simplicity.

4.  Methodology, Metrics, AQM Comparisons, Packet Sizes, Scheduling and
    ECN

4.1.  Methodology

   A description of each test setup should be detailed to allow this
   test to be compared with other tests.  This also allows others to
   replicate the tests if needed.  This test setup should detail
   software and hardware versions.  The tester could make its data
   available.

   The proposals should be evaluated on real-life systems, or they may
   be evaluated with event-driven simulations (such as ns-2, ns-3,
   OMNET, etc).  The proposed scenarios are not bound to a particular
   evaluation toolset.

   The tester is encouraged to make the detailed test setup and the
   results publicly available.

4.2.  Comments on metrics measurement

   The document presents the end-to-end metrics that ought to be used to
   evaluate the trade-off between latency and goodput in Section 2.  In
   addition to the end-to-end metrics, the queue-level metrics (normally
   collected at the device operating the AQM) provide a better
   understanding of the AQM behavior under study and the impact of its
   internal parameters.  Whenever it is possible (e.g., depending on the
   features provided by the hardware/software), these guidelines advise
   to consider queue-level metrics, such as link utilization, queuing
   delay, queue size or packet drop/mark statistics in addition to the
   AQM-specific parameters.  However, the evaluation must be primarily
   based on externally observed end-to-end metrics.






Kuhn, et al.            Expires December 12, 2016              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft       AQM Characterization Guidelines           June 2016


   These guidelines do not aim to detail on the way these metrics can be
   measured, since the way these metrics are measured is expected to
   depend on the evaluation toolset.

4.3.  Comparing AQM schemes

   This document recognizes that these guidelines may be used for
   comparing AQM schemes.

   AQM schemes need to be compared against both performance and
   deployment categories.  In addition, this section details how best to
   achieve a fair comparison of AQM schemes by avoiding certain
   pitfalls.

4.3.1.  Performance comparison

   AQM schemes should be compared against the generic scenarios that are
   summarized in Section 13.  AQM schemes may be compared for specific
   network environments such as data centers, home networks, etc.  If an
   AQM scheme has parameter(s) that were externally tuned for
   optimization or other purposes, these values must be disclosed.

   AQM schemes belong to different varieties such as queue-length based
   schemes (ex.  RED) or queueing-delay based scheme (ex.  CoDel, PIE).
   AQM schemes expose different control knobs associated with different
   semantics.  For example, while both PIE and CoDel are queueing-delay
   based schemes and each expose a knob to control the queueing delay --
   PIE's "queueing delay reference" vs. CoDel's "queueing delay target",
   the two tuning parameters of the two schemes have different
   semantics, resulting in different control points.  Such differences
   in AQM schemes can be easily overlooked while making comparisons.

   This document recommends the following procedures for a fair
   performance comparison between the AQM schemes:

   1.  similar control parameters and implications: Testers should be
       aware of the control parameters of the different schemes that
       control similar behavior.  Testers should also be aware of the
       input value ranges and corresponding implications.  For example,
       consider two different schemes - (A) queue-length based AQM
       scheme, and (B) queueing-delay based scheme.  A and B are likely
       to have different kinds of control inputs to control the target
       delay - target queue length in A vs. target queuing delay in B,
       for example.  Setting parameter values such as 100MB for A vs.
       10ms for B will have different implications depending on
       evaluation context.  Such context-dependent implications must be
       considered before drawing conclusions on performance comparisons.
       Also, it would be preferable if an AQM proposal listed such



Kuhn, et al.            Expires December 12, 2016              [Page 15]

Internet-Draft       AQM Characterization Guidelines           June 2016


       parameters and discussed how each relates to network
       characteristics such as capacity, average RTT etc.

   2.  compare over a range of input configurations: there could be
       situations when the set of control parameters that affect a
       specific behavior have different semantics between the two AQM
       schemes.  As mentioned above, PIE has tuning parameters to
       control queue delay that has a different semantics from those
       used in CoDel.  In such situations, these schemes need to be
       compared over a range of input configurations.  For example,
       compare PIE vs. CoDel over the range of target delay input
       configurations.

4.3.2.  Deployment comparison

   AQM schemes must be compared against deployment criteria such as the
   parameter sensitivity (Section 8.3), auto-tuning (Section 12) or
   implementation cost (Section 11).

4.4.  Packet sizes and congestion notification

   An AQM scheme may be considering packet sizes while generating
   congestion signals [RFC7141].  For example, control packets such as
   DNS requests/responses, TCP SYNs/ACKs are small, but their loss can
   severely impact application performance.  An AQM scheme may therefore
   be biased towards small packets by dropping them with lower
   probability compared to larger packets.  However, such an AQM scheme
   is unfair to data senders generating larger packets.  Data senders,
   malicious or otherwise, are motivated to take advantage of such AQM
   scheme by transmitting smaller packets, and could result in unsafe
   deployments and unhealthy transport and/or application designs.

   An AQM scheme should adhere to the recommendations outlined in the
   best current practive for dropping and marking packets document
   [RFC7141], and should not provide undue advantage to flows with
   smaller packets, such as discussed in the section 4.4 of the AQM
   recommendation document [RFC7567].  In order to evaluate if an AQM
   scheme is biased towards flows with smaller size packets, traffic can
   be generated, such as defined in Section 8.2.2, where half of the
   flows have smaller packets (e.g. 500 bytes packets) than the other
   half of the flow (e.g. 1500 bytes packets).  In this case, the
   metrics reported could be the same as in Section 6.3, where Category
   I is the set of flows with smaller packets and Category II the one
   with larger packets.  The bidirectional scenario could also be
   considered (Section 9.2).

Internet-Draft       AQM Characterization Guidelines           June 2016


4.5.  Interaction with ECN

   ECN [RFC3168] is an alternative that allows AQM schemes to signal
   receivers about network congestion that does not use packet drop.
   There are benefits of providing ECN support for an AQM scheme
   [WELZ2015].

   If the tested AQM scheme can support ECN, the testers must discuss
   and describe the support of ECN, such as discussed in the AQM
   recommendation [RFC7567].  Also, the AQM's ECN support can be studied
   and verified by replicating tests in Section 8.1 with ECN turned ON
   at the TCP senders.  The results can be used to not only evaluate the
   performance of the tested AQM with and without ECN markings, but also
   quantify the interest of enabling ECN.

4.6.  Interaction with Scheduling

   A network device may use per-flow or per-class queuing with a
   scheduling algorithm to either prioritize certain applications or
   classes of traffic, limit the rate of transmission, or to provide
   isolation between different traffic flows within a common class, such
   as discussed in the section 2.1 of the AQM recommendation document
   [RFC7567].

   The scheduling and the AQM conjointly impact on the end-to-end
   performance.  Therefore, the AQM proposal must discuss the
   feasibility to add scheduling combined with the AQM algorithm.  It
   can be explained whether the dropping policy is applied when packets
   are being enqueued or dequeued.

   These guidelines do not propose guidelines to assess the performance
   of scheduling algorithms.  Indeed, as opposed to characterizing AQM
   schemes that is related to their capacity to control the queuing
   delay in a queue, characterizing scheduling schemes is related to the
   scheduling itself and its interaction with the AQM scheme.  As one
   example, the scheduler may create sub-queues and the AQM scheme may
   be applied on each of the sub-queues, and/or the AQM could be applied
   on the whole queue.  Also, schedulers might, such as FQ-CoDel
   [HOEI2015] or FavorQueue [ANEL2014], introduce flow prioritization.
   In these cases, specific scenarios should be proposed to ascertain
   that these scheduler schemes not only helps in tackling the
   bufferbloat, but also are robust under a wide variety of operating
   conditions.  This is out of the scope of this document that focus on
   dropping and/or marking AQM schemes.

5.  Transport Protocols

   Network and end-devices need to be configured with a reasonable
   amount of buffer space to absorb transient bursts.  In some
   situations, network providers tend to configure devices with large
   buffers to avoid packet drops triggered by a full buffer and to
   maximize the link utilization for standard loss-based TCP traffic.

   AQM algorithms are often evaluated by considering Transmission
   Control Protocol (TCP) [RFC0793] with a limited number of
   applications.  TCP is a widely deployed transport.  It fills up
   available buffers until a sender transfering a bulk flow with TCP
   receives a signal (packet drop) that reduces the sending rate.  The
   larger the buffer, the higher the buffer occupancy, and therefore the
   queuing delay.  An efficient AQM scheme sends out early congestion
   signals to TCP to bring the queuing delay under control.

   Not all endpoints (or applications) using TCP use the same flavor of
   TCP.  Variety of senders generate different classes of traffic which
   may not react to congestion signals (aka non-responsive flows in the
   section 3 of the AQM recommendation document [RFC7567]) or may not
   reduce their sending rate as expected (aka Transport Flows that are
   less responsive than TCP, such as proposed in the section 3 of the
   AQM recommendation document [RFC7567], also called "aggressive
   flows").  In these cases, AQM schemes seek to control the queuing
   delay.

   This section provides guidelines to assess the performance of an AQM
   proposal for various traffic profiles -- different types of senders
   (with different TCP congestion control variants, unresponsive,
   aggressive).

5.1.  TCP-friendly sender

5.1.1.  TCP-friendly sender with the same initial congestion window

   This scenario helps to evaluate how an AQM scheme reacts to a TCP-
   friendly transport sender.  A single long-lived, non application-
   limited, TCP NewReno flow, with an Initial congestion Window (IW) set
   to 3 packets, transfers data between sender A and receiver B.  Other
   TCP friendly congestion control schemes such as TCP-friendly rate
   control [RFC5348] etc may also be considered.

   For each TCP-friendly transport considered, the graph described in
   Section 2.7 could be generated.

Internet-Draft       AQM Characterization Guidelines           June 2016


5.1.2.  TCP-friendly sender with different initial congestion windows

   This scenario can be used to evaluate how an AQM scheme adapts to a
   traffic mix consisting of TCP flows with different values of the IW.

   For this scenario, two types of flows must be generated between
   sender A and receiver B:

   o  A single long-lived non application-limited TCP NewReno flow;

   o  A single application-limited TCP NewReno flow, with an IW set to 3
      or 10 packets.  The size of the data transferred must be strictly
      higher than 10 packets and should be lower than 100 packets.

   The transmission of the non application-limited flow must start first
   and the transmission of the application-limited flow starts after the
   non application-limited flow has reached steady state.  The steady
   state can be assumed when the goodput is stable.

   For each of these scenarios, the graph described in Section 2.7 could
   be generated for each class of traffic (application-limited and non
   application-limited).  The completion time of the application-limited
   TCP flow could be measured.

5.2.  Aggressive transport sender

   This scenario helps testers to evaluate how an AQM scheme reacts to a
   transport sender that is more aggressive than a single TCP-friendly
   sender.  We define 'aggressiveness' as a higher increase factor than
   standard upon a successful transmission and/or a lower than standard
   decrease factor upon a unsuccessful transmission (e.g., in case of
   congestion controls with Additive-Increase Multiplicative-Decrease
   (AIMD) principle, a larger AI and/or MD factors).  A single long-
   lived, non application-limited, TCP Cubic flow transfers data between
   sender A and receiver B.  Other aggressive congestion control schemes
   may also be considered.

   For each flavor of aggressive transports, the graph described in
   Section 2.7 could be generated.

5.3.  Unresponsive transport sender

   This scenario helps testers to evaluate how an AQM scheme reacts to a
   transport sender that is less responsive than TCP.  Note that faulty
   transport implementations on an end host and/or faulty network
   elements en-route that "hide" congestion signals in packet headers
   may also lead to a similar situation, such that the AQM scheme needs
   to adapt to unresponsive traffic (see the section 3 of the AQM

   recommendation document [RFC7567]).  To this end, these guidelines
   propose the two following scenarios.

   The first scenario can be used to evaluate queue build up.  It
   considers unresponsive flow(s) whose sending rate is greater than the
   bottleneck link capacity between routers L and R.  This scenario
   consists of a long-lived non application limited UDP flow transmits
   data between sender A and receiver B.  Graphs described in
   Section 2.7 could be generated.

   The second scenario can be used to evaluate if the AQM scheme is able
   to keep the responsive fraction under control.  This scenario
   considers a mixture of TCP-friendly and unresponsive traffics.  It
   consists of a long-lived UDP flow from unresponsive application and a
   single long-lived, non application-limited (unlimited data available
   to the transport sender from application layer), TCP New Reno flow
   that transmit data between sender A and receiver B.  As opposed to
   the first scenario, the rate of the UDP traffic should not be greater
   than the bottleneck capacity, and should be higher than half of the
   bottleneck capacity.  For each type of traffic, the graph described
   in Section 2.7 could be generated.

5.4.  Less-than Best Effort transport sender

   This scenario helps to evaluate how an AQM scheme reacts to LBE
   congestion controls that 'results in smaller bandwidth and/or delay
   impact on standard TCP than standard TCP itself, when sharing a
   bottleneck with it.'  [RFC6297].  There are potential fateful
   interactions when AQM and LBE techniques are combined [GONG2014];
   this scenario helps to evaluate whether the coexistence of the
   proposed AQM and LBE techniques may be possible.

   A single long-lived non application-limited TCP NewReno flow
   transfers data between sender A and receiver B.  Other TCP-friendly
   congestion control schemes may also be considered.  Single long-lived
   non application-limited LEDBAT [RFC6817] flows transfer data between
   sender A and receiver B.  We recommend to set the target delay and
   gain values of LEDBAT respectively to 5 ms and 10 [TRAN2014].  Other
   LBE congestion control schemes may also be considered and are listed
   in the IETF survey of LBE protocols [RFC6297].

   For each of the TCP-friendly and LBE transports, the graph described
   in Section 2.7 could be generated.

6.  Round Trip Time Fairness

6.1.  Motivation

   An AQM scheme's congestion signals (via drops or ECN marks) must
   reach the transport sender so that a responsive sender can initiate
   its congestion control mechanism and adjust the sending rate.  This
   procedure is thus dependent on the end-to-end path RTT.  When the RTT
   varies, the onset of congestion control is impacted, and in turn
   impacts the ability of an AQM scheme to control the queue.  It is
   therefore important to assess the AQM schemes for a set of RTTs
   between A and B (e.g., from 5 ms to 200 ms).

   The asymmetry in terms of difference in intrinsic RTT between various
   paths sharing the same bottleneck should be considered, so that the
   fairness between the flows can be discussed.  In this scenario, a
   flow traversing on shorter RTT path may react faster to congestion
   and recover faster from it compared to another flow on a longer RTT
   path.  The introduction of AQM schemes may potentially improve the
   RTT fairness.

   Introducing an AQM scheme may cause the unfairness between the flows,
   even if the RTTs are identical.  This potential unfairness should be
   investigated as well.

6.2.  Recommended tests

   The recommended topology is detailed in Figure 1.

   To evaluate the RTT fairness, for each run, two flows are divided
   into two categories.  Category I whose RTT between sender A and
   receiver B should be 100ms.  Category II which RTT between sender A
   and receiver B should be in the range [5ms;560ms] inclusive.  The
   maximum value for the RTT represents the RTT of a satellite link
   [RFC2488].

   A set of evaluated flows must use the same congestion control
   algorithm: all the generated flows could be single long-lived non
   application-limited TCP NewReno flows.

6.3.  Metrics to evaluate the RTT fairness

   The outputs that must be measured are: (1) the cumulative average
   goodput of the flow from Category I, goodput_Cat_I (Section 2.5); (2)
   the cumulative average goodput of the flow from Category II,
   goodput_Cat_II (Section 2.5); (3) the ratio goodput_Cat_II/
   goodput_Cat_I; (4) the average packet drop rate for each category
   (Section 2.3).

7.  Burst Absorption

   "AQM mechanisms need to control the overall queue sizes, to ensure
   that arriving bursts can be accommodated without dropping packets"
   [RFC7567].

7.1.  Motivation

   An AQM scheme can face bursts of packet arrivals due to various
   reasons.  Dropping one or more packets from a burst can result in
   performance penalties for the corresponding flows, since dropped
   packets have to be retransmitted.  Performance penalties can result
   in failing to meet SLAs and be a disincentive to AQM adoption.

   The ability to accommodate bursts translates to larger queue length
   and hence more queuing delay.  On the one hand, it is important that
   an AQM scheme quickly brings bursty traffic under control.  On the
   other hand, a peak in the packet drop rates to bring a packet burst
   quickly under control could result in multiple drops per flow and
   severely impact transport and application performance.  Therefore, an
   AQM scheme ought to bring bursts under control by balancing both
   aspects -- (1) queuing delay spikes are minimized and (2) performance
   penalties for ongoing flows in terms of packet drops are minimized.

   An AQM scheme that maintains short queues allows some remaining space
   in the buffer for bursts of arriving packets.  The tolerance to
   bursts of packets depends upon the number of packets in the queue,
   which is directly linked to the AQM algorithm.  Moreover, an AQM
   scheme may implement a feature controlling the maximum size of
   accepted bursts, that can depend on the buffer occupancy or the
   currently estimated queuing delay.  The impact of the buffer size on
   the burst allowance may be evaluated.

7.2.  Recommended tests

   For this scenario, tester must evaluate how the AQM performs with a
   traffic mixed that could be composed of (from sender A to receiver
   B):

   o  Burst of packets at the beginning of a transmission, such as web
      traffic with IW10;

   o  Applications that send large bursts of data, such as bursty video
      frames;

   o  Background traffic, such as Constant Bit Rate (CBR) UDP traffic
      and/or A single non application-limited bulk TCP flow as
      background traffic.

   Figure 2 presents the various cases for the traffic that must be
   generated between sender A and receiver B.

   A new web page download could start after the previous web page
   download is finished.  Each web page could be composed by at least 50
   objects and the size of each object should be at least 1kB. 6 TCP
   parallel connections should be generated to download the objects,
   each parallel connections having an initial congestion window set to
   10 packets.

   For each of these scenarios, the graph described in Section 2.7 could
   be generated for each application.  Metrics such as end-to-end
   latency, jitter, flow completion time may be generated.  For the
   cases of frame generation of bursty video traffic as well as the
   choice of web traffic pattern, these details and their presentation
   are left to the testers.

8.  Stability

8.1.  Motivation

   The safety of an AQM scheme is directly related to its stability
   under varying operating conditions such as varying traffic profiles
   and fluctuating network conditions.  Since operating conditions can
   vary often the AQM needs to remain stable under these conditions
   without the need for additional external tuning.

   Network devices can experience varying operating conditions depending
   on factors such as time of the day, deployment scenario, etc.  For
   example:





Kuhn, et al.            Expires December 12, 2016              [Page 23]

Internet-Draft       AQM Characterization Guidelines           June 2016


   o  Traffic and congestion levels are higher during peak hours than
      off-peak hours.

   o  In the presence of a scheduler, the draining rate of a queue can
      vary depending on the occupancy of other queues: a low load on a
      high priority queue implies a higher draining rate for the lower
      priority queues.

   o  The capacity available can vary over time (e.g., a lossy channel,
      a link supporting traffic in a higher diffserv class).

   Whether the target context is a not stable environment, the ability
   of an AQM scheme to maintain its control over the queuing delay and
   buffer occupancy can be challenged.  This document proposes
   guidelines to assess the behavior of AQM schemes under varying
   congestion levels and varying draining rates.

8.2.  Recommended tests

   Note that the traffic profiles explained below comprises non
   application-limited TCP flows.  For each of the below scenarios, the
   graphs described in Section 2.7 should be generated, and the goodput
   of the various flows should be cumulated.  For Section 8.2.5 and
   Section 8.2.6 they should incorporate the results in per-phase basis
   as well.

   Wherever the notion of time has explicitly mentioned in this
   subsection, time 0 starts from the moment all TCP flows have already
   reached their congestion avoidance phase.

8.2.1.  Definition of the congestion Level

   In these guidelines, the congestion levels are represented by the
   projected packet drop rate, had a drop-tail queue was chosen instead
   of an AQM scheme.  When the bottleneck is shared among non
   application-limited TCP flows. l_r, the loss rate projection can be
   expressed as a function of N, the number of bulk TCP flows, and S,
   the sum of the bandwidth-delay product and the maximum buffer size,
   both expressed in packets, based on Eq. 3 of [MORR2000]:

   l_r = 0.76 * N^2 / S^2

   N = S * SQRT(1/0.76) * SQRT (l_r)

   These guidelines use the loss rate to define the different congestion
   levels, but they do not stipulate that in other circumstances,
   measuring the congestion level gives you an accurate estimation of
   the loss rate or vice-versa.

Internet-Draft       AQM Characterization Guidelines           June 2016


8.2.2.  Mild congestion

   This scenario can be used to evaluate how an AQM scheme reacts to a
   light load of incoming traffic resulting in mild congestion -- packet
   drop rates around 0.1%. The number of bulk flows required to achieve
   this congestion level, N_mild, is then:

   N_mild = ROUND (0.036*S)

8.2.3.  Medium congestion

   This scenario can be used to evaluate how an AQM scheme reacts to
   incoming traffic resulting in medium congestion -- packet drop rates
   around 0.5%. The number of bulk flows required to achieve this
   congestion level, N_med, is then:

   N_med = ROUND (0.081*S)

8.2.4.  Heavy congestion

   This scenario can be used to evaluate how an AQM scheme reacts to
   incoming traffic resulting in heavy congestion -- packet drop rates
   around 1%. The number of bulk flows required to achieve this
   congestion level, N_heavy, is then:

   N_heavy = ROUND (0.114*S)

8.2.5.  Varying the congestion level

   This scenario can be used to evaluate how an AQM scheme reacts to
   incoming traffic resulting in various levels of congestion during the
   experiment.  In this scenario, the congestion level varies within a
   large time-scale.  The following phases may be considered: phase I -
   mild congestion during 0-20s; phase II - medium congestion during
   20-40s; phase III - heavy congestion during 40-60s; phase I again,
   and so on.

8.2.6.  Varying available capacity

   This scenario can be used to help characterize how the AQM behaves
   and adapts to bandwidth changes.  The experiments are not meant to
   reflect the exact conditions of Wi-Fi environments since it is hard
   to design repetitive experiments or accurate simulations for such
   scenarios.

   To emulate varying draining rates, the bottleneck capacity between
   nodes 'Router L' and 'Router R' varies over the course of the
   experiment as follows:



Kuhn, et al.            Expires December 12, 2016              [Page 25]

Internet-Draft       AQM Characterization Guidelines           June 2016


   o  Experiment 1: the capacity varies between two values within a
      large time-scale.  As an example, the following phases may be
      considered: phase I - 100Mbps during 0-20s; phase II - 10Mbps
      during 20-40s; phase I again, and so on.

   o  Experiment 2: the capacity varies between two values within a
      short time-scale.  As an example, the following phases may be
      considered: phase I - 100Mbps during 0-100ms; phase II - 10Mbps
      during 100-200ms; phase I again, and so on.

   The tester may choose a phase time-interval value different than what
   is stated above, if the network's path conditions (such as bandwidth-
   delay product) necessitate.  In this case the choice of such time-
   interval value should be stated and elaborated.

   The tester may additionally evaluate the two mentioned scenarios
   (short-term and long-term capacity variations), during and/or
   including TCP slow-start phase.

   More realistic fluctuating capacity patterns may be considered.  The
   tester may choose to incorporate realistic scenarios with regards to
   common fluctuation of bandwidth in state-of-the-art technologies.

   The scenario consists of TCP NewReno flows between sender A and
   receiver B.  To better assess the impact of draining rates on the AQM
   behavior, the tester must compare its performance with those of drop-
   tail and should provide a reference document for their proposal
   discussing performance and deployment compared to those of drop-tail.
   Burst traffic, such as presented in Section 7.2, could also be
   considered to assess the impact of varying available capacity on the
   burst absorption of the AQM.

8.3.  Parameter sensitivity and stability analysis

   The control law used by an AQM is the primary means by which the
   queuing delay is controlled.  Hence understanding the control law is
   critical to understanding the behavior of the AQM scheme.  The
   control law could include several input parameters whose values
   affect the AQM scheme's output behavior and its stability.
   Additionally, AQM schemes may auto-tune parameter values in order to
   maintain stability under different network conditions (such as
   different congestion levels, draining rates or network environments).
   The stability of these auto-tuning techniques is also important to
   understand.

   Transports operating under the control of AQM experience the effect
   of multiple control loops that react over different timescales.  It
   is therefore important that proposed AQM schemes are seen to be



Kuhn, et al.            Expires December 12, 2016              [Page 26]

Internet-Draft       AQM Characterization Guidelines           June 2016


   stable when they are deployed at multiple points of potential
   congestion along an Internet path.  The pattern of congestion signals
   (loss or ECN-marking) arising from AQM methods also need to not
   adversely interact with the dynamics of the transport protocols that
   they control.

   AQM proposals should provide background material showing control
   theoretic analysis of the AQM control law and the input parameter
   space within which the control law operates as expected; or could use
   another way to discuss the stability of the control law.  For
   parameters that are auto-tuned, the material should include stability
   analysis of the auto-tuning mechanism(s) as well.  Such analysis
   helps to understand an AQM control law better and the network
   conditions/deployments under which the AQM is stable.

9.  Various Traffic Profiles

   This section provides guidelines to assess the performance of an AQM
   proposal for various traffic profiles such as traffic with different
   applications or bi-directional traffic.

9.1.  Traffic mix

   This scenario can be used to evaluate how an AQM scheme reacts to a
   traffic mix consisting of different applications such as:

   o  Bulk TCP transfer

   o  Web traffic

   o  VoIP

   o  Constant Bit Rate (CBR) UDP traffic

   o  Adaptive video streaming (either unidirectional or bidirectional)

   Various traffic mixes can be considered.  These guidelines recommend
   to examine at least the following example: 1 bi-directional VoIP; 6
   Web pages download (such as detailed in Section 7.2); 1 CBR; 1
   Adaptive Video; 5 bulk TCP.  Any other combinations could be
   considered and should be carefully documented.

   For each scenario, the graph described in Section 2.7 could be
   generated for each class of traffic.  Metrics such as end-to-end
   latency, jitter and flow completion time may be reported.






Kuhn, et al.            Expires December 12, 2016              [Page 27]

Internet-Draft       AQM Characterization Guidelines           June 2016


9.2.  Bi-directional traffic

   Control packets such as DNS requests/responses, TCP SYNs/ACKs are
   small, but their loss can severely impact the application
   performance.  The scenario proposed in this section will help in
   assessing whether the introduction of an AQM scheme increases the
   loss probability of these important packets.

   For this scenario, traffic must be generated in both downlink and
   uplink, such as defined in Section 3.1.  The amount of asymmetry
   between the uplink and the downlink depends on the context.  These
   guidelines recommend to consider a mild congestion level and the
   traffic presented in Section 8.2.2 in both directions.  In this case,
   the metrics reported must be the same as in Section 8.2 for each
   direction.

   The traffic mix presented in Section 9.1 may also be generated in
   both directions.

10.  Example of multi-AQM scenario

10.1.  Motivation

   Transports operating under the control of AQM experience the effect
   of multiple control loops that react over different timescales.  It
   is therefore important that proposed AQM schemes are seen to be
   stable when they are deployed at multiple points of potential
   congestion along an Internet path.  The pattern of congestion signals
   (loss or ECN-marking) arising from AQM methods also need to not
   adversely interact with the dynamics of the transport protocols that
   they control.

   Figure Figure 3 describes topology options for evaluating multi-AQM
   scenarios.  The AQM schemes are applied in sequence and impact the
   induced latency reduction, the induced goodput maximization and the
   trade-off between these two.  Note that AQM schemes A and B
   introduced in Routers L and M could be (I) same scheme with identical
   parameter values, (ii) same scheme with different parameter values,
   or (iii) two different schemed.  To best understand the interactions
   and implications, the mild congestion scenario as described in
   Section 8.2.2 is recommended such that the number of flows is equally
   shared among senders A and B.  Other relevant combination of
   congestion levels could also be considered.  We recommend to measure
   the metrics presented in Section 8.2.

11.  Implementation cost

11.1.  Motivation

   Successful deployment of AQM is directly related to its cost of
   implementation.  Network devices can need hardware or software
   implementations of the AQM mechanism.  Depending on a device's
   capabilities and limitations, the device may or may not be able to
   implement some or all parts of their AQM logic.

   AQM proposals should provide pseudo-code for the complete AQM scheme,
   highlighting generic implementation-specific aspects of the scheme
   such as "drop-tail" vs. "drop-head", inputs (e.g., current queuing
   delay, queue length), computations involved, need for timers, etc.
   This helps to identify costs associated with implementing the AQM
   scheme on a particular hardware or software device.  This also
   facilitates discsusions around which kind of devices can easily
   support the AQM and which cannot.

11.2.  Recommended discussion

   AQM proposals should highlight parts of their AQM logic that are
   device dependent and discuss if and how AQM behavior could be
   impacted by the device.  For example, a queueing-delay based AQM
   scheme requires current queuing delay as input from the device.  If
   the device already maintains this value, then it can be trivial to
   implement the their AQM logic on the device.  If the device provides
   indirect means to estimate the queuing delay (for example:
   timestamps, dequeuing rate), then the AQM behavior is sensitive to
   the precision of the queuing delay estimations are for that device.
   Highlighting the sensitivity of an AQM scheme to queuing delay
   estimations helps implementers to identify appropriate means of
   implementing the mechanism on a device.

12.  Operator Control and Auto-tuning

12.1.  Motivation

   One of the biggest hurdles of RED deployment was/is its parameter
   sensitivity to operating conditions -- how difficult it is to tune
   RED parameters for a deployment to achieve acceptable benefit from
   using RED.  Fluctuating congestion levels and network conditions add
   to the complexity.  Incorrect parameter values lead to poor
   performance.

   Any AQM scheme is likely to have parameters whose values affect the
   control law and behaviour of an AQM.  Exposing all these parameters
   as control parameters to a network operator (or user) can easily
   result in a unsafe AQM deployment.  Unexpected AQM behavior ensues
   when parameter values are set improperly.  A minimal number of
   control parameters minimizes the number of ways a user can break a
   system where an AQM scheme is deployed at.  Fewer control parameters
   make the AQM scheme more user-friendly and easier to deploy and
   debug.

   "AQM algorithms should not require tuning of initial or configuration
   parameters in common use cases." such as stated in the section 4.3 of
   the AQM recommendation document [RFC7567].  A scheme ought to expose
   only those parameters that control the macroscopic AQM behavior such
   as queue delay threshold, queue length threshold, etc.

   Additionally, the safety of an AQM scheme is directly related to its
   stability under varying operating conditions such as varying traffic
   profiles and fluctuating network conditions, as described in
   Section 8.  Operating conditions vary often and hence the AQM needs
   to remain stable under these conditions without the need for
   additional external tuning.  If AQM parameters require tuning under
   these conditions, then the AQM must self-adapt necessary parameter
   values by employing auto-tuning techniques.

12.2.  Recommended discussion

   In order to understand an AQM's deployment considerations and
   performance under a specific environment, AQM proposals should
   describe the parameters that control the macroscopic AQM behavior,
   and identify any parameters that require tuning to operational
   conditions.  It could be interesting to also discuss that even if an
   AQM scheme may not adequately auto-tune its parameters, the resulting
   performance may not be optimal, but close to something reasonable.






Kuhn, et al.            Expires December 12, 2016              [Page 30]

Internet-Draft       AQM Characterization Guidelines           June 2016


   If there are any fixed parameters within the AQM, their setting
   should be discussed and justified, to help understand whether a fixed
   parameter value is applicable for a particular environment.

   If an AQM scheme is evaluated with parameter(s) that were externally
   tuned for optimization or other purposes, these values must be
   disclosed.

13.  Summary

   Figure 4 lists the scenarios and their requirements for an extended
