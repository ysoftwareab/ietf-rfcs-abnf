Abstract

     The provider provisioned VPN solutions has attracted a great deal
     of interest. Memos proposing different and overlapping solution
     have been discussed on the PPVPN mailing list and in the Working
     Group meetings. This has lead to a development of a partly new
     set of concepts used to describe the set of VPN services. To a
     certain extent there are more than one term covering the same
     concept and sometimes the same term covers more than on concept.
     The terminology needs to be made clearer and more intuitive. This
     document seeks to fill at least part of that need.

1.      Introduction

        There are a comparatively large number of memos being submitted to
        the former PPVPN, and L2VPN, L3VPN and PWE3 working groups that
        all addresses the same problem space, provider provisioned virtual
        private networking for end customers. The memos address a wide
        range of services, but there is also a great deal of commonality
        among the proposed solutions.

Andersson / Madsen              Expires March 2004                 [Page 4]

      This has lead to a development of a partly new set of concepts
      used to describe this set of VPN services. To a certain extent
      there are more than one term covering the same concept and
      sometimes the same term covers more than one concept. The
      terminology needs to be made clearer and more intuitive.

      This document seeks to fill at least part of the need and proposes
      a foundation for a unified terminology for the L2VPN, L3VPN
      working groups; in some cases the parallel concepts within the
      PWE3 working group is used as references.


2.    PPVPN Terminology

      The concepts and terms in this list are gathered from Internet
      Drafts sent to the L2VPN and L3VPN mailing lists (earlier PPVPN
      mailing list) and RFCs relevant to the L2VPN and L3VPN working
      groups. The focus is on terminology and concepts that are specific
      to the PPVPN area, but this is not strictly enforced, e.g. there
      are concepts and terms within the PWE3 and (Generalized) MPLS
      areas that are closely related. We've tried to find the earliest
      use of terms and concepts.

      This document intends to fully cover the concepts within five core
      documents from the L2VPN and L3VPN working groups the "Generic
      Requirements for Provider Provisioned VPN" [GENERIC], the "A
      Framework for Layer 3 Provider Provisioned Virtual Private
      Networks" [L3VPN-frmwrk], the "Service requirements for Layer 3
      Provider Provisioned Virtual Private Networks" [PPVPN-req], the
      "L2VPN Framework [L2VPN-frmwrk] and "Service Requirements for
      Layer 2 Provider Provisioned Virtual Private Networks" [L2VPN-
      req]. The intention is to create a comprehensive and unified set
      of concepts for these documents, and by extension for the entire
      PPVPNarea.Todosoitisalsonecessarytogivesomeofthe
      development the concepts of the area have been through.

      The document is structured in four major sections. Section 4 lists
      the different services that has been/will be specified, Section 5
      lists the building blocks that is used to specify those services,
      section 6 lists the functions needed in those services and section
      7 list some typical devices used in customer and provider
      networks.

3.    Provider Provisioned Virtual Private Network services

      In this section we define the terminology that relates the set of
      services to solutions specified by the L2VPN and L3VPN working
      groups. The concept "pseudo wire" that belongs to the PWE3 working
      group is included for reference purposes. For requirements in
      provider provisioned VPNs see [PPVPN-req].

      In this section all abbreviations are listed in alphabetic order.

3.1 IP-only LAN-like Service (IPLS)

      An IPLS is very like a VPLS (see 3.8), except that:

        - it is assumed that the CE devices (see 5.1) are hosts or
           routers, not switches

        - it is assumed that the service will only need to carry IP
           packets, and supporting packets such as ICMP and ARP;
           otherwise layer 2 packets which do not contain IP are not
           supported.

      While this service is a functional subset of the VPLS service, it
      is considered separately because it may be possible to provide it
      using different mechanisms, which may allow it to run on certain
      hardware platforms that cannot support the full VPLS functionality
      [PPVPN-L2-frmwrk].

3.2 Layer 2 VPN (L2VPN)

      Three types of L2VPNs are described in this document, Virtual
      Private Wire Service (VPWS) (section 3.11), VPLS Virtual Private
      LAN Service (VPLS)(section 3.8), and IP-only LAN-like Service
      (IPLS).

3.3 Layer 3 VPN (L3VPN)

      An L3VPN is a solution that interconnects several sets of hosts
      and routers and allows them to communicate based on L3 addresses,
      see [L3VPN-frmwrk].

3.4 Pseudo Wire (PW)

      The PWE3 working group within IETF specifies the pseudo wire
      technology. A pseudo wire is an emulated point-to-point
      connectivity over a packet switched network that gives the
      possibility to interconnect two nodes with any L2 technology. The


INTERNET-DRAFT    draft-ietf-l3vpn-ppvpn-terminology-00.txt         25.09.03



Andersson / Madsen              Expires March 2004             [Page 6]

     PW shares some of the building blocks and architecture constructs
     with the point to multipoint solutions, e.g. PE (see 5.2) and CE
     (see 5.1). An early solution for PWs is described in [martini-
     tran]. Encapsulation formats readily used in VPWS, VPLS and PWs
     are described in [martini-encap]. Requirements for PWs are found
     in [PWE3-req] and [PWE3-frmwrk] present an architectural framework
     for PWs.

3.5 Transparent LAN Service (TLS)

     TLS was an early name used to describe the VPLS service, it was
     used e.g. in the now dated draft-lasserre-tls-mpls-00.txt. It has
     been replaced by VPLS, which is the current term.

3.6 Virtual LAN (VLAN)

     A VLAN is a way of separating traffic on a LAN, e.g. between
     different departments within a company. This acronym is not
     defined by former PPVPN working group, but is defined by IEEE
     802.1Q. The VLANID is used to mark an Ethernet frame with a tag to
     create user groups on a LAN.

3.7 Virtual Leased Line Service (VLLS)

     The VLLS has been replaced by VPWS. It was used in now dated
     draft-ppvpn-metrics.00.txt.

3.8 Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)

     A VPLS is a provider service that emulates the full functionality
     of a traditional Local Area Network. A VPLS makes it possible to
     interconnect several LAN segments over a packet switched network
     (PSN) and makes the remote LAN segments behave as one single LAN.
     For an early work on defining a solution and protocol for a VPLS
     see [L2VPN-req], [Lasserre-vkompella], and [Kompella-VPLS].

     In a VPLS the provider network emulates a learning bridge and
     forwarding decisions are taken based on MAC addresses or MAC
     addresses and VLAN tag.

3.9 Virtual Private Network (VPN)

     VPN is a generic term that covers the use of public or private
     networks to create groups of users that are separated from other
     network users and may communicate among them as if they were on a
     private network. The level of separation is possible to enhance
     e.g. by end-to-end encryption, this is however outside the scope


INTERNET-DRAFT    draft-ietf-l3vpn-ppvpn-terminology-00.txt    25.09.03



Andersson / Madsen               Expires March 2004              [Page 7]

      of IETF VPN working group charters. This VPN definition is from
      [RFC2764].

      In the [L3VPN-frmwrk] the term VPN is used to refer to a specific
      set of sites as either an intranet or an extranet that have been
      configured to allow communication. Note that a site is a member of
      at least one VPN, and may be a member of many VPNs.

      In this document "VPN" is also used as a generic name for all
      services listed in section 3.

3.10 Virtual Private Switched Network (VPSN)

      A VPSN is replaced by VPLS. The VPSN abbreviation was used e.g. in
      the now dated draft-vkompella-ppvpn-vpsn.reqmts-00.txt.

3.11 Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS)

      A Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) is a point-to-point circuit
      (link) connecting two Customer Edge devices. The CE in the
      customer network is connected to a PE in the provider network via
      an Attachment Circuit (see 6.1); the Attachment Circuit is either
      a physical or a logical circuit.

      The PE's in the core network is connected via a PW.

      The CE devices can be routers, bridges, switches or hosts. In some
      implementations a set of VPWSs is used to create a multi-site
      L2VPN network. An example of a VPWS solution is described in
      [L2VPN].

      A VPWS differs from a VPLS (section 4.8) in that the VPLS is point
      to multipoint, while the VPWS is point to point. See [L2VPN-
      frmwrk].


4.    Classification of VPNs

      The terminology used in [GENERIC] is defined based on the figure
      below.

     The figure above presents a taxonomy of PPVPN technologies. Some
     of the definitions are given below:

     CE-based VPN: A VPN approach in which the shared service provider
     network does not have any knowledge of the customer VPN. This
     information is limited to CE equipment. All the VPN-specific
     procedures are performed in the CE devices, and the PE devices are
     not aware in any way that some of the traffic they are processing
     is VPN traffic (see also [L3VPN-frmwrk]).

     PE-Based VPNs: A Layer 3 VPN approach in which a service provider
     network is used to interconnect customer sites using shared
     resources. Specifically the PE device maintains VPN state,
     isolating users of one VPN from users of another VPN. Because the
     PE device maintains all required VPN state, the CE device may
     behave as if it were connected to a private network. Specifically,
     the CE in a PE-based VPN must not require any changes or
     additional functionality to be connected to a PPVPN instead of a
     private network.

     The PE devices know that certain traffic is VPN traffic. They
     forward the traffic (through tunnels) based on the destination IP
     address of the packet, and optionally on based on other
     information in the IP header of the packet. The PE devices are
     themselves the tunnel endpoints. The tunnels may make use of
     various encapsulations to send traffic over the SP network (such
     as, but not restricted to, GRE, IP-in-IP, IPsec, or MPLS
     tunnels)[L3VPN-frmwrk].


     Virtual Router (VR) style: A PE-based VPN approach in which the PE
     router maintains a complete logical router for each VPN that it
     supports. Each logical router maintains a unique forwarding table



INTERNET-DRAFT    draft-ietf-l3vpn-ppvpn-terminology-00.txt        25.09.03



Andersson / Madsen                Expires March 2004               [Page 9]

      and executes a unique instance of the routing protocols. These
      VPNs are described in [PPVPN-VR].

      RFC 2547 Style: A PE-based VPN approach in which the PE router
      maintains separate forwarding environment for each VPN and a
      separate forwarding table for each VPN. In order to maintain
      multiple forwarding table instances while running only a single
      routing protocol instance, RFC 2547 style VPNs mark route
      advertisements with attributes that identify their VPN context.
      These VPNs are based on the approach described in [RFC2547bis].


5.    Building blocks

      Starting with specifications of L3VPNs, e.g. the 2547
      specification [RFC2547] and [RFC2547bis] and Virtual Routers
      [PPVPN-VR], a way of describing the building blocks and allocation
      of functions in VPN solutions was developed. The building blocks
      are often in day-to-day talk treated as if it were physical boxes,
      common for all services.

      However, for different reasons this is to over-simplify. Any of
      the building blocks could be implemented across more than one
      physical box. How common the use of such implementations will be
      is beyond the scope of this document.

5.1 Customer Edge device (CE)

      A CE is the name of the device with the functionality needed on
      the customer premises to access the services specified by the
      former PPVPN working group.

      There are two different aspects that need to be considered in
      naming CE devices. One could start with the type of device that is
      used to implement the CE (see section 5.1.1). It is also possible
      to use the service the CE provides and with the result it will be
      a set of "prefixed CEs", (see section 5.1.2).

      It is common practice to use "CE" to indicate any of these boxes,
      since it is very often unambiguous in the specific context.

5.1.1 Device based CE naming


5.1.1.1 Customer Edge Router (CE-R)

      A CE-R is a router in the customer network interfacing the
      provider network. There are many reasons to use a router in the


INTERNET-DRAFT    draft-ietf-l3vpn-ppvpn-terminology-00.txt        25.09.03



Andersson / Madsen                Expires March 2004            [Page 10]

       customer network, e.g. in an L3VPN using private IP addressing
       this is the router that is able to do forwarding based on the
       private addresses. Another reason to require the use of a CE-R on
       the customer side is that one want to limit the number on MAC-
       addresses that needs to be learnt in the provider network.

       A CE-R could be used to access both L2 and L3 services.


5.1.1.2 Customer Edge Switch (CE-S)

       A CE-S is a service aware L2 switch in the customer network
       interfacing the provider network. In a VPWS or a VPLS it is not
       strictly necessary to use a router in the customer network, a
       layer 2 switch might very well do the job.

5.1.2 Service based CE naming

       The list below is just examples and it will be extended as the
       number of services increases.


5.1.2.1 L3VPN-CE

       An L3VPN-CE is the device or set of devices on the customer
       premises that attaches to a provider provisioned L3VPN, e.g. a
       2547bis implementation.


5.1.2.2 VPLS-CE

       A VPLS-CE is the device or set of devices on the customer premises
       that attaches to a provider provisioned VPLS.


5.1.2.3 VPWS-CE

       A VPWS-CE is the device or set of devices on the customer premises
       that attaches to a provider provisioned VPWS.

5.2 Provider Edge (PE)

       A PE is the name of the device or set of devices at the edge of
       the provider network with the functionality that is needed to
       interface the customer. PE, without further qualifications, is
       very often used for naming the devices since it is made
       unambiguous by the context.




INTERNET-DRAFT      draft-ietf-l3vpn-ppvpn-terminology-00.txt     25.09.03



Andersson / Madsen               Expires March 2004             [Page 11]

       In naming PEs there are three aspects that we need to consider,
       the service they support, whether the functionality needed for
       service is distributed across more than one device and the type of
       device they are build on.

5.2.1 Device based PE naming

       Both routers and switches may be used to implement PEs, however
       the scaling properties will be radically different depending which
       type of equipment that is chosen.


5.2.1.1 Provider Edge Router (PE-R)

       A PE-R is a L3 device that participates in the PSN (see section 8)
       routing and forwards packets based on the routing information.


5.2.1.2 Provider Edge Switch (PE-S)

       APE-SisaL2devicethatparticipatesine.g.aswitched
       Ethernet taking forwarding decision packets based on L2 address
       information.

5.2.2 Service based PE naming


5.2.2.1 L3VPN-PE

       An L3VPN-PE is a device or set of devices at the edge of the
       provider network interfacing the customer network, with the
       functionality needed for an L3VPN.


5.2.2.2 VPWS-PE

       A VPWS-PE is a device or set of devices at the edge of the
       provider network interfacing the customer network, with the
       functionality needed for a VPWS.


5.2.2.3 VPLS-PE

       A VPLS-PE is a device or set of devices at the edge of the
       provider network interfacing the customer network, with the
       functionality needed for a VPLS.

5.2.3 Distribution based PE naming

       For scaling reasons it is in the VPLS/VPWS cases sometimes desired
       to distribute the functions in the VPLS/VPWS-PE across more than
       one device, e.g. is it feasible to allocate MAC address learning
       on a comparatively small and in-expensive device close to the
       customer site, while participation in the PSN signalling and set
       up of PE to PE tunnels are done by routers closer to the network
       core.

       When distributing functionality across devices a protocol is
       needed to exchange information between the Network facing PE (N-
       PE) see section 5.2.3.1 and the User facing PE (U-PE) see section
       5.2.3.2.


5.2.3.1 Network facing PE (N-PE)

       The N-PE is the device to which the signalling and control
       functions are allocated when a VPLS-PE is distributed across more
       than one box.


5.2.3.2 User facing PE (U-PE)

       The U-PE is the device to which the functions needed to take
       forwarding or switching decision at the ingress of the provider
       network.

5.3 Core

5.3.1 Provider router (P)

       ThePisdefinedasarouterinthecorenetworkthatdoesnot
       have interfaces directly towards a customer. Hence a P router does
       not need to keep VPN state and is VPN un-aware.

5.4 Naming in specific Internet drafts

5.4.1 Layer 2 PE (L2PE)

       L2PE is the joint name of the devices in the provider network that
       implement L2 functions needed for a VPLS or a VPWS.

5.4.2 Logical PE (LPE)

       The term Logical PE (LPE) originates from a dated Internet Draft
       "VPLS/LPE L2VPNs: Virtual Private LAN Services using Logical PE
       Architecture" and was used to describe a set of devices used in a
       provider network to implement a VPLS. In a LPE, VPLS functions are
       distributed across small devices (PE-Edges/U-PE) and devices
       attached to a network core (PE-Core/N-PE). In an LPE solution the
       PE-edge and PE-Core can be interconnected by a switched Ethernet
       transport network(s) or uplinks. The LPE will appear to the core
       network as a single PE. In this document the devices that
       constitutes the LPE is called N-PE and U-PE.

5.4.3 PE-CLE

       An alternative name for the U-PE suggested in now dated Internet
       Draft "VPLS architectures".

5.4.4 PE-Core

       See the origins and use of this concept in section 5.4.2.

5.4.5 PE-Edge

       See the origins and use of this concept in section 5.4.2.

5.4.6 PE-POP

       An alternative name for the U-PE suggested in now dated Internet
       Draft "VPLS architectures".

5.4.7 VPLS Edge (VE)

       The term VE originates from a dated Internet Draft on a
       distributed transparent LAN service and was used to describe the
       deviceusedbyaprovidernetworktohandoffaVPLStoa
       customer. In this document the VE is called a VPLS-PE.

       This name has dated.


6.     Functions

       In this section we have grouped a number of concepts and terms
       that has to be performed to make the VPN services work.

Andersson / Madsen                Expires March 2004              [Page 14]

6.1 Attachment Circuit (AC)

       In a Layer 2 VPN the CE is attached to PE via an Attachment
       Circuit (AC). The AC may be a physical or logical link.


6.2 Backdoor Links

       Backdoor Links are links between CE devices that are provided by
       the end customer rather than the SP; may be used to interconnect
       CE devices in multiple-homing arrangements [L3VPN-frmwrk].

6.3 Endpoint discovery

       Endpoint discovery is the process by which the devices that are
       aware of a specific VPN service will find all customer facing
       ports that belong to the same service.

       The requirements on endpoint discovery and signalling are
       discussed in [PPVPN-req]. It was also the topic in a now dated
       Internet Draft reporting from a design team activity on VPN
       discovery.

6.4 Flooding

       Flooding is a function related to L2 and L3 services; when a PE
       receives a frame with an unknown destination MAC-address, that
       frame is send out over (flooded) every other interface.

6.5 MAC address learning

       MAC address learning is a function related to L2 services; when PE
       receives a frame with an unknown source MAC-address the
       relationship between that MAC-address and interface is learnt for
       future forwarding purposes. In a layer 2 VPN solution from the
       L2VPN WG, this function is allocated to the VPLS-PE.

6.5.1 Qualified learning

       In qualified learning, the learning decisions at the U-PE are
       based on the customer Ethernet frame's MAC address and VLAN tag,
       if a VLAN tag exists. If no VLAN tag exists, the default VLAN is
       assumed.

Andersson / Madsen             Expires March 2004                [Page 15]

6.5.2 Unqualified learning

       In unqualified learning, learning is based on a customer Ethernet
       frame's MAC address only.

6.6 Signalling

       Signalling is the process by which the PEs that have VPNs behind
       them exchange information to set up PWs, PSN tunnels and tunnel
       multiplexers. This process might be automated through a protocol
       or done by manual configuration. Different protocols may be used
       to establish the PSN tunnels and exchange the tunnel multiplexers.




7.     'Boxes'

       We list a set of boxes that will typically be used in an
       environment that supports different kinds of VPN services. We have
       chosen to include some names of boxes that originate outside the
       protocol specifying organisations.

7.1 Aggregation box

       The aggregation box is typically an L2 switch that is service
       unaware and is used only to aggregate traffic to more function
       rich points in the network.

7.2 Customer Premises Equipment (CPE)

       The CPE equipment is the box that a provider places with the
       customer. It serves two purposes, giving the customer ports to
       plug in to and making it possible for a provider to monitor the
       connectivity to the customer site. The CPE is typically a low cost
       box with limited functionality and in most cases not aware of the
       VPN services offered by the provider network.

       The CPE equipment is not necessarily the equipment to which the CE
       functions are allocated, but is part of the provider network and
       used for monitoring purposes.

       The CPE name is used primarily in network operation and deployment
       contexts, and should not be used in protocol specifications.

Andersson / Madsen                Expires March 2004            [Page 16]

7.3 Multi Tenant Unit (MTU)

       An MTU [DTLS] is typically an L2 switch placed by a service
       provider in a building where customers of that service provider
       are located.

       The MTU device name is used primarily in network operation and
       deployment contexts, and should not be used in protocol
       specifications, as it is also a used abbreviation for Maximum
       Transmit Units.


8.     Packet Switched Network (PSN)

       A PSN is the network through which the tunnels supporting the VPN
       services are set up.

8.1 Route Distinguisher (RD)

       A Route Distinguisher [RFC2547bis] is an 8-byte value that
       togetherwitha4byteIPv4addressidentifiesaVPN-IPv4address
       family. If two VPNs use the same IPv4 address prefix, the PEs
       translates these into unique VPN-IPv4 address prefixes. This
       ensures that if the same address is used in two different VPNs, it
       is possible to install two completely different routes to that
       address, one for each VPN.

8.2 Route Reflector

       A route reflector is a network element owned by a Service Provider
       (SP) that is used to distribute BGP routes to the SP's BGP-enabled
       routers [L3VPN-frmwrk].

8.3 Route Target (RT)

       A Route Target attribute [RFC2547bis] can be thought of as
       identifying a set of sites, or more precisely a set of VRFs (see
       section 8.8).

       Associating a particular Route Target with a route, allows that
       route to be placed in all VRFs that are used for routing traffic
       received from the corresponding sites.

       A Route Target attribute is also a BGP extended community used in
       [RFC2547], and [BGPVPN-auto]. A Route Target community is used to
       constrain VPN information distribution to the set of VRFs. A route

Andersson / Madsen                 Expires March 2004           [Page 17]

       target can be perceived as identifying a set of sites, or more
       precisely a set of VRFs.

8.4 Tunnel

       A tunnel is connectivity through a PSN that is used to send
       traffic across the network from one PE to another. The tunnel
       provides a mechanism to transport packets from one PE to another,
       separation of one customer's traffic from another customer's
       traffic is done based on tunnel multiplexers (see section 8.4).
       How the tunnel is established depends on the tunnelling mechanisms
       provided by the PSN, i.e. the tunnel could be based on e.g. the
       IP-header, an MPLS label, the L2TP Session ID, or on the GRE Key
       field.

8.5 Tunnel multiplexor

       A tunnel multiplexor is an entity that is sent with the packets
       traversing the tunnel to make possible to decide to which instance
       of a service a packet belongs and from which sender it was
       received. In [L2VPN] the tunnel multiplexor is formatted as an
       MPLS label.

8.6 Virtual Channel (VC)

       A VC is transported within a tunnel and identified by its tunnel
       multiplexer. A virtual channel is identified by a VCI (Virtual
       Channel Identifier). In the PPVPN context a VCI is a VC label or
       tunnel multiplexer and in the Martini case it is equal to the
       VCID.

8.7 VC label

       In an MPLS enabled IP network a VC label is an MPLS label, used to
       identify traffic within a tunnel that belongs to a particular VPN,
       i.e. the VC label is the tunnel multiplexer in networks that uses
       MPLS labels.

8.8 Inner label

       "Inner label" is another name for VC label (see section 8.6).

8.9 VPN Routing and Forwarding (VRF)

       In networks running 2547 VPN's [RFC2547], PE routers maintain
       VRF's. A VRF is a per-site forwarding table. Every site to which



INTERNET-DRAFT        draft-ietf-l3vpn-ppvpn-terminology-00.txt      25.09.03



Andersson / Madsen             Expires March 2004             [Page 18]

       the PE router is attached is associated with one of these tables.
       A particular packet's IP destination address is looked up in a
       particular VRF only if that packet has arrived directly from a
       site, which is associated with that table.

8.10 VPN Forwarding Instance (VFI)

       VPN Forwarding Instance (VFI) is a logical entity that resides in
       a PE that includes the router information base and forwarding
       information base for a VPN instance [L3VPN-frmwrk].

8.11 Virtual Switch Instance (VSI)

       In a layer 2 context a VSI is a virtual switching instance that
       serves one single VPLS [L2VPN-frmwrk]. A VSI performs standard LAN
       (i.e., Ethernet) bridging functions. Forwarding done by a VSI is
       based on MAC addresses and VLAN tags, and possibly other relevant
       information on a per VPLS basis. The VSI is allocated to VPLS-PE
       or in the distributed case to the U-PE.

8.12 Virtual Router (VR)

       A Virtual Router (VR) is software and hardware based emulation of
       a physical router. Virtual routers have independent IP routing and
       forwarding tables and they are isolated from each other, see
       [PPVPN-VR].
