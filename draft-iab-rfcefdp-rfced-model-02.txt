            RFC Series Policy Definition and Implementation
                    draft-iab-rfcefdp-rfced-model-02

Abstract

   This document describes updated processes for defining and
   implementing policies regarding the RFC Series.  As specified here,
   the model divides the responsibilities for the RFC Series into two
   high-level functions: policy definition governing the RFC Series as a
   whole, and policy implementation for publication of documents in the
   RFC Series.  The policy definition function is the responsibility of
   the RFC Series Working Group (RSWG), which produces policy proposals
   that are subject to approval by the RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB).
   The policy implementation function is primarily the responsibility of
   the RFC Production Center (RPC), under the ultimate authority of the
   IETF Administration Limited Liability Company (IETF LLC).

   This document reflects experience gained with version 1 of the RFC
   Editor Model as specified in RFC 5620 and with version 2 as specified
   in RFC 6635 and RFC 8728.

   This document obsoletes RFC 8728.

1.  Introduction

   As described in RFCs have been published continually since 1969
   [RFC8729], the Request for Comments (RFC) Series is the archival
   series dedicated to documenting Internet technical specifications,
   including general contributions from the Internet research and
   engineering community as well as standards documents.[RFC8700].

   The processes and organizational models for publication of RFCs have
   changed significantly over the years.  Most recently, in 2009
   [RFC5620] defined the RFC Editor Model (Version 1) and in 2012
   [RFC6635] defined the RFC Editor Model (Version 2), since modified
   slightly in 2020 by [RFC8728].  Following historical precedent, these
   documents used the term "RFC Editor function" or "RFC Editor" to
   identify the collective set of responsibilities for publishing
   documents in the RFC series.

   In order to provide a sustainable basis for ongoing publication of
   the RFC series, this document divides the responsibilities for the
   RFC Series into two high-level functions: policy definition governing
   the Series as a whole, and policy implementation through publication
   of documents in the Series.  The policy definition function is the
   responsibility of the RFC Series Working Group (RSWG), which produces
   policy proposals that are subject to approval by the RFC Series
   Approval Board (RSAB).  The policy implementation function is
   primarily the responsibility of the RFC Production Center (RPC),
   under the ultimate authority of the IETF Administration Limited
   Liability Company (LLC) [RFC8711].  Therefore this document
   introduces new functions and in some cases makes significant changes
   to the responsibilities of existing bodies and functions (see
   Section 7 of this document for a summary of the changes).

   This document obsoletes RFC 8728.

2.  Overview of the Model

   Version 2 of the RFC Editor Model [RFC8728] specified a structure
   consisting of the RFC Series Editor, the RFC Production Center, and
   the RFC Publisher, with oversight provided by the RFC Series
   Oversight Committee (RSOC) on behalf of the Internet Architecture
   Board (IAB).

Internet-Draft              RFC Series Policy             September 2021


   Discussion within the RFCED-Future Program has led in the direction
   of a more consensus-oriented structure (similar in some respects to
   the structure of technical work within the IETF or IRTF) that retains
   roles for specialized expertise in document editing and publication.

   The policy definition function is performed by the RFC Series Working
   Group (RSWG), which produces policy proposals that are subject to
   approval by the RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB), after which such
   policies are formally established through publication in the
   Editorial Stream within the RFC Series.  The RSWG is an open working
   group (as described below) that seeks input and participation from a
   wide range of persons who have an interest in the RFC Series.  The
   RSAB consists of appointed members who represent the various RFC
   streams [RFC8728] as well as an expert in technical publishing, the
   RFC Series Editor/Advisor (RSEA).

   The policy implementation function is performed by the RFC Production
   Center (RPC), under the ultimate authority of the IETF Administration
   Limited Liability Company (IETF LLC).

   In short:

   *  The RSWG proposes policies that govern the RFC Series as a whole,
      with input from the community, the RSAB, and the RSEA.

   *  The RSAB considers those proposals and approves them, returns them
      to the RSWG for further consideration, or declines to publish
      them, as appropriate.

   *  If approved, such proposals are published as RFCs in the Editorial
      Stream and thus define the policies to be followed by the RSWG,
      RSAB, RSEA, and RPC.

   *  The RSEA provides expert advice to the RPC and RSAB on how to
      implement established policies on an ongoing and operational
      basis, which can include raising issues or initiating proposed
      policy changes within the RSWG.

   *  The RPC implements the policies defined by the Editorial Stream in
      its day-to-day editing and publication of RFCs from other streams.

   *  If issues arise with the implementation of particular policies,
      the RPC brings those issues to the RSAB, which interprets the
      policies and provides interim guidance to the RPC, informing the
      RSWG of those interpretations.

   The remainder of this document describes the model in greater detail.

Internet-Draft              RFC Series Policy             September 2021


3.  Policy Definition Function

   Policies governing the RFC series as a whole are defined in the open
   through proposals that are generated by and discussed within the RFC
   Series Working Group (RSWG) and then approved by the RFC Series
   Approval Board (RSAB).

   Policies under the purview of the RSWG and RSAB might include but are
   not necessarily limited to document formats, processes for
   publication and dissemination of RFCs, and overall management of the
   RFC series.

3.1.  Structure and Roles

3.1.1.  RFC Series Working Group (RSWG)

   NOTE: There is discussion within the RFCED-Future Program regarding
   the appropriate name for this entity; provisionally "RFC Series
   Working Group" (RSWG) is used here, but the name might change in
   future versions of this document.

   The RFC Series Working Group (RSWG) shall formulate proposals
   regarding policies that govern the RFC series.  The intent is that
   the RSWG operate in a way similar to working groups in the IETF and
   research groups in the IRTF.  Therefore, all RSWG meetings shall be
   open to any participant, and all RSWG contributions shall be subject
   to intellectual property policies, which must be consistent with
   those of the IETF as specified in BCP 78 [RFC5378] and BCP 79
   [RFC8179].

   The RSWG shall operate by rough consensus, a mode of operation
   informally described in [RFC7282].

   When the RSWG is formed, all discussions shall take place on an open
   email discussion list.  Subsequently, the RSWG may decide by rough
   consensus to also use additional tooling (e.g., GitHub as specified
   in [RFC8874]), forms of communication (e.g., in-person or online
   meetings), and working methods (e.g., design teams) as long as they
   are consistent with [RFC2418].

Internet-Draft              RFC Series Policy             September 2021


   All interested persons are welcome to participate in the RSWG
   (subject to anti-harassment policies as described below).  This
   includes participants in the IETF and IRTF, IAB and IESG members,
   individuals who use RFCs in procurement decisions, authors of RFCs
   and Internet-Drafts, developers of tools used to authors RFCs, and
   the like.  The IETF LLC Board members, staff, and the IETF Executive
   Director are invited to participate as community members in the RSWG
   to the extent permitted by any relevant IETF LLC policies.  Members
   of the RSAB are also expected to participate actively.

   The RSWG shall have two chairs, one appointed by the IESG and the
   other appointed by the IAB.  When the RSWG is formed, the chair
   appointed by the IESG shall serve for a term of one (1) year and the
   chair appointed by the IAB shall serve for a term of two (2) years;
   thereafter, chairs shall serve for a term of two (2) years, with no
   term limits on renewal.  The appointing bodies shall determine their
   own processes for making these appointments, such as provision for an
   open nominations period.  Community members who have concerns about
   the performance of an RSWG chair should direct their feedback to the
   relevant appointing body.  Each appointing body shall have the power
   to replace its appointed chair at its discretion at any time, with
   the replacement serving the remainder of the original chair's term.

   It is the responsibility of the chairs to encourage rough consensus
   within the RSWG and to follow that consensus in their decision
   making, for instance regarding acceptance of new proposals and
   advancement of proposals to the RSAB.

   Absent specific guidance in this document regarding the roles and
   responsibilities of the chairs, the general guidance provided in
   Section 6.1 of [RFC2418] should be considered appropriate.

Internet-Draft              RFC Series Policy             September 2021


3.1.2.  RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB)

   The RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB) shall act as the approving body
   for proposals generated within the RSWG.  The sole function of the
   RSAB is to review policy proposals generated by the RSWG; it shall
   have no independent authority to formulate policy on its own.  It is
   expected that the RSAB will respect the rough consensus of the RSWG
   wherever possible, without ceding its review function.

   The voting members of the RSAB shall be as follows:

   *  One delegate representing the IETF stream, appointed by the IESG

   *  One delegate representing the IAB stream, appointed by the IAB

   *  One delegate representing the IRTF stream, appointed by the IRTF
      Chair

   *  The Independent Submissions Editor [RFC8730]

   *  The RFC Series Editor/Advisor

   The appointing bodies shall determine their own processes for
   appointing delegates, such as provision for an open nominations
   period.  If it becomes necessary to replace such a delegate for any
   reason, then for the sake of continuity the appointing body should
   name a new delegate to complete the former delegate's term.

   To ensure the smooth functioning of the RFC Series, the RSAB shall
   include the IETF Executive Director as a non-voting member since the
   IETF LLC is ultimately responsible for the operation of the policy
   implementation function.  The RSAB may at its discretion include
   additional non-voting members, for instance a liaison from the RPC.

   Whenever a new stream is created, the document that creates the
   stream shall specify if a voting member representing that stream
   shall also be added to the RSAB, along with any rules and processes
   related to that representative (e.g., whether the representative is a
   member of the body responsible for the stream or an appointed
   delegate thereof).  In effect, the RSEA is the voting member
   representing the Editorial Stream.

   The RSAB shall annually choose a chair from among its members using a
   method to be determined by the RSAB.  If the chair position is
   vacated during the chair's term, the RSAB should choose a new chair
   from among its members.

Internet-Draft              RFC Series Policy             September 2021


   The RSAB is expected to operate via email, in-person meetings,
   teleconferencing systems, and any additional tooling it deems
   necessary.

   The RSAB shall keep a public record of its proceedings, including
   minutes of all meetings and a record of all decisions.

   The RSAB shall announce plans and agendas for their meetings on the
   RFC Editor website and by email to the RSWG at least a week before
   such meetings.  The meetings shall be open for public attendance and
   the RSAB may consider allowing open participation.  If the RSAB needs
   to discuss a confidential matter in executive session, that part of
   the meeting shall be private to the RSAB, but must be noted on the
   agenda, and must be documented in the minutes with as much detail as
   confidentiality requirements permit.

   (https://github.com/intarchboard/program-rfced-future/issues/9),
   ISSUE #38 (https://github.com/intarchboard/program-rfced-future/

   (https://github.com/intarchboard/program-rfced-future/issues/71).

3.2.  Process

3.2.1.  Intent

   The intent is to provide an open forum by which policies related to
   the RFC series are defined and evolved.  The general expectation is
   that all interested parties will participate in the RSWG, and that
   only under extreme circumstances should RSAB members need to hold
   "CONCERN" positions as described below.

   Because policy issues can be difficult and contentious, RSWG
   participants and RSAB members are strongly encouraged to work
   together in a spirit of good faith and mutual understanding to
   achieve rough consensus (see [RFC7282]).  In particular, RSWG members
   are encouraged to take RSAB concerns seriously, and RSAB members are
   encouraged to clearly express their concerns early in the process and
   to be responsive to the community.  All parties are encouraged to
   respect the value of each stream and the long-term health and
   viability of the RFC series.

   This process is intended to be one of continuous consultation.  RSAB
   members should consult with their constituent stakeholders (e.g.,
   authors, editors, tool developers, and consumers of RFCs) on an
   ongoing basis, so that when the time comes to consider a proposal,

Internet-Draft              RFC Series Policy             September 2021


   there should be no surprises.  Appointing bodies are expected to
   establish whatever processes they deem appropriate to facilitate this
   goal.

3.2.2.  Specifics

   The following process shall be used to formulate or modify processes
   related to the RFC series:

   1.  An individual participant in the RSWG generates a proposal in the
       form of an Internet-Draft, which is submitted in full conformance
       with the provisions of BCP 78 [RFC5378] and BCP 79 [RFC8179].

   2.  If (following procedures for rough consensus) the chairs
       determine that there is sufficient interest in the proposal, the
       RSWG may adopt the proposal as a draft proposal of the RSWG, in
       much the same way a working group of the IETF or research group
       of the IRTF would (see [RFC2418]).

   3.  The RSWG shall then further develop the proposal.  Members of the
       RSAB are expected to participate in discussion relating to such
       proposals so that they are fully aware of proposals early in the
       policy definition process and so that any issues or concerns that
       they have will be raised during the development of the proposal
       (not be left until the RSAB review period).  The RWSG chairs are
       also expected to participate as individuals.

   4.  At some point, if the RSWG chairs believe there may be rough
       consensus for the proposal to advance, they will issue a last
       call for comment within the working group.

   5.  After a comment period of suitable length, the RSWG chairs will
       determine whether rough consensus for the proposal exists (taking
       their own feedback as individuals into account along with
       feedback from other participants).  If comments have been
       received and substantial changes have been made, additional last
       calls may be necessary.

   6.  Once consensus is established in the RSWG, the RSAB shall issue a
       community call for comments as further described below.  If
       substantial comments have been received, the RSWG will again
       consider those comments and make revisions as they see fit.  At
       this same time, the RSAB will also consider the proposal.

   7.  If substantial changes have been made, additional community calls
       for comment should be issued by the RSAB, and again comments
       considered by the RSWG.

Internet-Draft              RFC Series Policy             September 2021


   8.  Once all comments have been addressed, the RSWG chairs will
       submit the proposal to the RSAB for its consideration.

   9.  Within a reasonable period of time, the RSAB will then poll among
       its members regarding the proposal.  Positions may be as follows:

       *  "YES": the proposal should be approved

       *  "CONCERN": the proposal raises substantial concerns that must
          be addressed

       *  "RECUSE": the person holding the position has a conflict of
          interest

   Any RSAB member holding a "CONCERN" position must explain their
   concern to the community in detail.  The explanation might or might
   not be actionable.

   A CONCERN may be made for two reasons:

   *  The proposal represents a serious problem for the stream or group
      that a particular member represents.

   *  The RSAB member believes that the proposal would cause serious
      harm to the overall series, including harm to the long term health
      and viability of the series.

   Because RSAB members should have been participating in discussions
   within the RSWG, no position of CONCERN should ever come as a
   surprise to the RSWG.

   1.  If a CONCERN exists, discussion will take place within the RSWG.
       Again, all RSAB members are expected to participate.

   2.  A proposal without any CONCERN positions is approved.  If
       substantial changes have been made in order to address CONCERN
       positions, an additional call for community input might be
       needed.

   3.  If, after a suitable period of time, any CONCERN positions
       remain, a formal vote of the RSAB is taken.  If a majority of
       RSAB members vote to approve, the proposal is approved.
       Otherwise, it is returned to the RSWG.  In the case of a tie, the
       proposal is approved.

   4.  When a proposal is approved, a notification is sent to the

       an RFC within the Editorial Stream.

Internet-Draft              RFC Series Policy             September 2021


   NOTE: This section is intended to address ISSUE #45
   (https://github.com/intarchboard/program-rfced-future/issues/45) and
   ISSUE #69 (https://github.com/intarchboard/program-rfced-future/
   issues/69).

3.2.3.  Community Calls for Comment

   When a community call for comment is made, the RSAB sends a notice
   containing:

   *  A subject line beginning with 'Call for Comment:'

   *  A clear, concise summary of the proposal

   *  A URL for the proposal document

   *  Any commentary or questions for the community that the RSAB deems
      necessary (using their usual decision-making procedures)

   *  Clear instructions on how to provide public comments

   *  A deadline for comments

   Notices will always be sent to the rfc-interest mailing list.  The
   RSAB and RSWG should also send notices to other communities that may
   be interested in or impacted by a proposal as they see fit, following
   policies for those communities as appropriate.  Notices are also to
   be made available and archived on the rfc-editor.org web site.  In
   addition, other communication channels can be established for notices
   (e.g., using an RSS feed or social media).

   A comment period will not last less than two weeks.  Comments will be
   publicly archived on the rfc-editor.org web site.

   NOTE: This section is intended to address ISSUE #67
   (https://github.com/intarchboard/program-rfced-future/issues/67).

3.2.4.  Appeals

   Appeals of RSWG decisions shall be made to the RSAB.  Decisions of
   the RSWG can be appealed only on grounds of failure to follow the
   correct process.  Appeals should be made within 30 days of any
   action, or in the case of failure to act, of notice having been given
   to the RSWG.  The RSAB will then decide if the process was followed
   and will direct the RSWG chairs as to what procedural actions are
   required.

Internet-Draft              RFC Series Policy             September 2021


   Appeals of RSAB decisions shall be made to the IAB and should be made
   within thirty (30) days of public notice of the relevant RSAB
   decision (typically, when minutes are posted).  The IAB shall decide
   whether a process failure occurred and what if any corrective action
   should take place.

   NOTE: This section is intended to address ISSUE #16
   (https://github.com/intarchboard/program-rfced-future/issues/16) and
   ISSUE #36 (https://github.com/intarchboard/program-rfced-future/
   issues/36).

3.2.5.  Anti-Harassment Policy

   The IETF anti-harassment policy
   (https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/anti-harassment-
   policy/) also applies to the RSWG and RSAB, which strive to create
   and maintain an environment in which people of many different
   backgrounds are treated with dignity, decency, and respect.
   Participants are expected to behave according to professional
   standards and to demonstrate appropriate workplace behavior.  See
   also [RFC7154], [RFC7776], and [RFC8716].

4.  RFC Series Editor/Advisor (RSEA)

   NOTE: Discussion continues within the RFCED-Future Program regarding
   the appropriate title for an expert in technical publication
   processes.  To retain flexibility, this document temporarily refers
   to the individual as the "RFC Series Editor/Advisor" ("RSEA").

   The RFC Series Editor/Advisor (RSEA) is a senior technical publishing
   professional who will apply their deep knowledge of technical
   publishing processes to the RFC series.

   The primary responsibilities of the RSEA are as follows:

   *  Serve as a voting member on the RSAB

   *  Identify problems with the RFC publication process and
      opportunities for improvement

   *  Provide expert advice regarding policy proposals within the RSWG

   *  If requested, provide expert advice to the RPC and IETF LLC

   Matters on which the RSEA might be consulted could include proposed
   changes to the RFC style guide [RFC7322], RFC formatting in general,
   web presence for the RFC Series, copyright matters, archiving policy,
   and dissemination and cataloguing of RFCs.

Internet-Draft              RFC Series Policy             September 2021


   The IETF LLC is responsible for the method of and management of the
   engagement of the RSEA.  Therefore, whether the RSEA role is
   structured as a contractual or employee relationship is a matter for
   the IETF LLC and the IETF Executive Director to determine.

   NOTE: This section is intended to address ISSUE #12
   (https://github.com/intarchboard/program-rfced-future/issues/12) and
   ISSUE #24 (https://github.com/intarchboard/program-rfced-future/
   issues/24).

4.1.  RSEA Selection

   The IETF LLC will form a selection committee, including members from
   the community, that will be responsible for making a recommendation
   to the IETF LLC for the RSEA role.  The selection committee will take
   into account the role definition (https://github.com/intarchboard/
   program-rfced-future/blob/master/Issue12-RSE-role.md) as well as any
   other information that the committee deems necessary or helpful in
   making its decision.  The IETF LLC is responsible for contracting or
   employment of the RSEA.

4.2.  RSEA Performance Evaluation

   Periodically, the IETF LLC will evaluate the performance of the RSEA,
   including a call for confidential input from the community.  The IETF
   LLC will produce a draft performance evaluation for the RSAB (not
   including the RSEA), which will provide feedback to the IETF LLC.

5.  Policy Implementation Function

5.1.  Roles and Processes

   Publication of RFCs shall is handled by the RFC Production Center
   (RPC).

   In general, the RPC is instructed by RFCs published in the Editorial
   Stream (i.e., not directly by the RSWG, RSAB, or RSEA), is advised by
   the RSAB and has a duty to ask for that advice under specific
   circumstances, and is contractually overseen by the IETF LLC to
   ensure that it performs in accordance with contracts in place.

   Within these parameters, at a high level the RPC is tasked with the
   following activities:

   *  Editing documents from the streams and publishing them as RFCs.

   *  Participating in the creation of new Editorial Stream RFCs that
      impact the RPC, at least in an advisory capacity.



Saint-Andre               Expires 18 March 2022                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft              RFC Series Policy             September 2021


   *  Providing reports to the community on its performance and plans.

   *  Consulting with the community on its plans.

   *  Negotiating its resources with the IETF LLC.

   All matters of budget, timetable and impact on its performance
   targets, are between the RPC and IETF LLC.

   The RPC shall report regularly to the IETF LLC, RSAB, RSWG, and
   broader community regarding its activities and any key risks or
   issues affecting it.

   In the event that the RPC is required to make a decision without
   consultation that would normally deserve consultation, or makes a
   decision against the advice of the RSAB, the RPC must notify the
   RSAB.

   This document does not specify the exact relationship between the
   IETF LLC and the RPC; for example, the work of the RPC could be
   performed by a separate corporate entity under contract to the IETF
   LLC, it could be performed by employees of the IETF LLC, or the IETF
   LLC could engage with independent contractors for some or all aspects
   of such work.  The exact relationship is a matter for the IETF LLC
   and the IETF Executive Director to determine.

   The IETF LLC is responsible for the method of and management of the
   engagement of the RPC.  Therefore, the IETF LLC has authority over
   negotiating performance targets for the RPC and also has
   responsibility for ensuring that those targets are adhered to.  The
   IETF LLC is empowered to appoint a manager or to convene a committee
   to complete these activities.

   If individuals or groups within the community have concerns about the
   performance of the RPC, they can request that the IETF LLC look into
   the matter.  Even if the IETF LLC opts to delegate this activity,
   concerns should be raised with the IETF LLC.  The IETF LLC is
   ultimately responsible to the community via the mechanisms outlined
   in its charter.

5.2.  Editorial and Publication Policies

   Under and consistent with the high-level policies defined for the RFC
   Series in general or particular streams, the RPC shall define more
   particular policies regarding matters related to the editorial
   preparation and final publication and dissemination of RFCs.
   Examples include:




Saint-Andre               Expires 18 March 2022                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft              RFC Series Policy             September 2021


   *  Maintenance of a style guide that defines editorial standards to
      which RFCs must adhere (see [RFC7322] and the style guide web page
      (https://www.rfc-editor.org/styleguide/)).

   *  Policies regarding the file formats that are accepted as input to
      the editing and publication process.

   *  Policies regarding the final structure and layout of published
      documents.  In the context of the XML vocabulary ([RFC7991]), such
      policies could include matters such as the exact XML elements and
      attributes used to capture the semantic content of RFCs.  More
      generally, such policies could address the readability and
      presentation of information in RFCs.

5.3.  Resolution of Disagreements between Authors and the RPC

   During the process of editorial preparation and publication,
   disagreements can arise between the authors of an RFC-to-be and the
   RPC.  Where an existing policy clearly applies, typically such
   disagreements are handled in a straightforward manner through direct
   consultation between the authors and the RPC, sometimes in
   collaboration with other individuals such as a document shepherd,
   IETF working group chair, IRSG research group chair, or IETF Area
   Director.

   However, if it is unclear whether an existing policy applies, or if
   the interpretation of an existing policy is unclear, the parties may
   need to consult with additional individuals or bodies (e.g., RSAB,
   IESG, IRSG, or stream manager) to help achieve a resolution.  The
   following points are intended to provide more particular guidance.

   *  If there is a conflict with a policy for a particular stream, the
      RPC should consult with the relevant stream manager to help
      achieve a resolution, if needed also conferring with a per-stream
      body such as the IESG or IRSG.

   *  If there is a conflict with a cross-stream policy, the RPC should
      consult with the RSAB to achieve a resolution.

   *  If the disagreement raises a new issue that is not covered by an
      existing policy or that cannot be resolved through consultation
      between the RPC and other relevant individuals and bodies (as
      described above), the issue should be brought to the RSWG in order
      to formulate a new policy.  However, in the interest of time the
      disagreement may be resolved as the parties best see fit while the
      RSWG formulates a more general policy.

   (https://github.com/intarchboard/program-rfced-future/issues/6) and
   ISSUE #59 (https://github.com/intarchboard/program-rfced-future/
   issues/59).

5.4.  Administrative Implementation

   The exact implementation of the administrative and contractual
   activities described here are a responsibility of the IETF LLC.  This
   section provides general guidance regarding several aspects of such
   activities.

   NOTE: This section is intended to address ISSUE #25
   (https://github.com/intarchboard/program-rfced-future/issues/25),
   ISSUE #57 (https://github.com/intarchboard/program-rfced-future/

   future/issues/61), ISSUE #62 (https://github.com/intarchboard/
   program-rfced-future/issues/62), and ISSUE #63
   (https://github.com/intarchboard/program-rfced-future/issues/63),

5.4.1.  Vendor Selection for the RFC Production Center

   Vendor selection is done in cooperation with the streams and under
   the final authority of the IETF LLC.

   The IETF LLC develops the work definition (the Statement of Work) for
   the RPC and manages the vendor selection process.  The work
   definition is created within the IETF LLC budget and takes into
   account the needs of stream managers as well as community input.

   The process to select and contract for an RFC Production Center and
   other RFC-related services is as follows:

   *  The IETF LLC establishes the contract process, including the steps
      necessary to issue an RFP when necessary, the timing, and the
      contracting procedures.

   *  The IETF LLC establishes a selection committee, which will consist
      of the IETF Executive Director and other members selected by the
      IETF LLC in consultation with the stream managers.  The committee
      shall select a chair from among its members.

   *  The selection committee selects the vendor, subject to the
      successful negotiation of a contract approved by the IETF LLC.  In
      the event that a contract cannot be reached, the matter shall be
      referred to the selection committee for further action.

5.4.2.  Budget

   The expenses discussed in this document are not new expenses.  They
   have been and remain part of the IETF LLC budget.

   The RFC Series portion of the IETF LLC budget shall include funding
   to support the RSEA, the RFC Production Center, and the Independent
   Stream.

   The IETF LLC has the responsibility to approve the total RFC Editor
   budget (and the authority to deny it).  All relevant parties must
   work within the IETF LLC budgetary process.

6.  Streams

   This document creates the Editorial Stream.  Any and all future
   documents produced by the RSWG and approved by the RSAB shall be
   published in the Editorial Stream.  Documents pubished in the
   Editorial Stream shall have a status of Informational.  The Editorial
   Stream is not authorized to publish RFCs that are Standards Track or
   Best Current Practice, since such RFCs are reserved to the IETF
   Stream [RFC8729].

   The Editorial Stream will be used only to specify and update the
   strategy, policy, and procedures of the RFC Series itself; no other
   use of the Editorial Stream is authorized by this memo and no other
   streams are so authorized.  This policy may be changed only by
   agreement of the IAB, IESG, and IETF LLC.

   The requirements and process for creating any additional RFC streams
   are outside the scope of this document.

   NOTE: This section is intended to address ISSUE #22
   (https://github.com/intarchboard/program-rfced-future/issues/22),
   ISSUE #35 (https://github.com/intarchboard/program-rfced-future/
   issues/35), ISSUE #63 (https://github.com/intarchboard/program-rfced-
   future/issues/63), and ISSUE #73 (https://github.com/intarchboard/
   program-rfced-future/issues/73).

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines several functions related to the RFC Series and
   places the responsibility for coordination of registry value
   assignments with the RPC.  The IETF LLC facilitates management of the
   relationship between the RPC and IANA.

   This document does not create a new registry nor does it register any
   values in existing registries, and no IANA action is required.

Internet-Draft              RFC Series Policy             September 2021


8.  Security Considerations

   The same security considerations as those in [RFC8729] apply.  The
   processes for the publication of documents must prevent the
   introduction of unapproved changes.  Since the RFC Editor maintains
   the index of publications, sufficient security must be in place to
   prevent these published documents from being changed by external
   parties.  The archive of RFC documents, any source documents needed
   to recreate the RFC documents, and any associated original documents
   (such as lists of errata, tools, and, for some early items, originals
   that are not machine-readable) need to be secured against any kind of
   data storage failure.

   The IETF LLC should take these security considerations into account
   during the implementation and enforcement of any relevant contracts.

9.  Changes from RFC 8728

9.1.  RFC Series Editor

   The RSWG and RSAB together provide a public process by which policies
   for the RFC Series can be defined.  It is expected that these bodies
   will therefore cover some of the responsibilities of the RFC Series
   Editor function as defined by RFC 8728.

9.2.  RFC Series Oversight Committee (RSOC)

   In practice, the relationships and lines of authority and
   responsibility between the IAB, RSOC, and RSE have proved unwieldy
   and somewhat opaque.  To overcome some of these issues, this document
   dispenses with the RSOC.

10.  Updates to RFC 8729

   This document incorporates some text directly from [RFC8729] and also
   makes the following updates:

   *  This document creates the Editorial Stream.

   *  Future changes to policies governing the RFC Series as a whole now
      occur through documents defined by the RSWG and approved by the
      RSAB.

   *  As described above, several responsibilities previously assigned
      to the "RFC Editor function" are now performed by the RSWG, RSAB,
      RPC, and IETF LLC (alone or in combination).  These include
      aspects of operational oversight (Section 3.3 of [RFC8729]),
      policy oversight (Section 3.4 of [RFC8729]), the editing,

      processing, and publication of documents (Section 4.2 of
      [RFC8729]), and series-wide guidelines and rules (Section 4.4 of
      [RFC8729]).

      In addition, some details regarding these responsibilities have
      been modified to accord with the new framework defined in this
      document.

11.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
