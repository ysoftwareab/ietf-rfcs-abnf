        2.  Abstract
        
        This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
        (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-
        based internets.  In particular, it defines objects for
        managing Data Compression over a Frame Relay virtual circuit.
        This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet
        community.
        

        
        3.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
        
        The major components of the SNMPv2 Network Management
        framework are described in the documents listed below.
        
        o    RFC 1902 [1] defines the Structure of Management
             Information (SMI), the mechanisms used for describing and
             naming objects for the purpose of management.
        
        o    STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] defines MIB-II, the core set of
             managed objects (MO) for the Internet suite of protocols.
        
        o    RFC 1905 [3] defines the protocol used for network access
             to managed objects.
        
        o    RFC 1315 [4] defines the protocol used for managing
             Frame Relay DTE's.

        The framework is adaptable/extensible by defining new MIBs to
        suit  the requirements of specific
        applications/protocols/situations.
        
        Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
        the  MIB.  Objects  in  the  MIB  are  defined  using the
        subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the
        SMI. In particular, each object type is named by an OBJECT
        IDENTIFIER, which is an administratively assigned name. The
        object  type  together  with  an  object  instance  serves  to
        uniquely  identify  a  specific  instantiation  of the object.
        For human convenience, often a textual string, termed the
        descriptor, is  used  to refer to the object type.

        
	4.  Overview
        
        4.1.  Frame Relay Data Compression

        This MIB addresses the instances needed to be able to manage the
        Frame Relay Forum's Implementation agreements for 
        Data Compression (FRF.9).
