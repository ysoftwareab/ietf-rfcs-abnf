    Abstract 

       In this draft, WCMT-SCTP(WCMT:Wireless Concurrent Multi-path 
       Transfer)is proposed to allow a host to improve the transmission 
       throughput in wireless multi-hop networks using simultaneous multi-
       path transmission of Stream Control Transmission Protocol. Relevant

       issues of WCMT-SCTP included are: (1) data transmission mode and path 
       selection, (2) path management and, (3) multi-path handover mechanism. 
       Transmission modes of WCMT-SCTP, and the path handover mechanism, are 
       designed to enhance the transmission throughput and solve the receive 
       buffer blocking problem of different wireless link status. Since the 
       transmission paths used for WCMT-SCTP may differ when an WCMT-SCTP 
       host moves, the multi-path handover problem is defined, and a 
       handover mechanism is proposed.

    1. Introduction 

    1.1.Wireless mobile sctp 

       Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)[1]is a transport layer 
       protocol that supports multihoming in nature. The SCTP ADDIP 
       Extention[2] enables an SCTP endpoint to dynamically add a new IP 
       address and delete an unnecessary IP address, and change the primary 
       IP address used for the association without terminating the 
       correspongding association. A new SCTP chunk type that the SCTP 
       Address Reconfiguration introduces is the SCTP ASCONF(Address 
       Configuration Change)chunk type. The SCTP ASCONF chunk is used to 
       notify the corresponding event to the remote endpoint when one of the 
       events such as ADD (to add a new IP address), DELETE (to delete 
       anunnecessary IP address), or CHANGE (to change the primary path) 
       occurs in an ongoing association. With the functions provided by SCTP 
       ADDIP Extension, SCTP becomes more powerful when it is adopted in 
       wireless mobile networks. The changed sctp protocol which is enabled 
       the address reconfiguration is called mobile sctp(msctp). Some 
       researches of mSCTP, which is based on the SCTP ADDIP Extension, are 
       also proposed to enable the mobility support of SCTP [3][4]. 

    1.2. SCTP multi-path transmission 

       Currently, some researchers are proposed to enable SCTP to transmit 
       data through multiple paths to improve transmission throughput, e.g., 
       IPCC-SCTP, LS-SCTP, Westwood SCTP, cmpSCTP, and mmpSCTP. 

    1.3. Wireless mobile Multi-path transmission using SCTP 

       The main scope of this draft is to investigate relevant issues of 
       multi-path transmission using SCTP in wireless multi-hop mobile 
       networks, and try to propose a protocol extension of SCTP, namely, 
       WCMT-SCTP. In this draft, a concurrent multi-path transmission 
       mechanism is proposed to improve the throughput under different 
       wireless network status. Furthermore, a possible path selection 
       policy that is used to select the paths used by WCMT-SCTP is also 
       proposed in this draft. 

       The scope of this draft also includes the path handover managements 
       of WCMT-SCTP. i.e., the substitute paths selection of WCMT-SCTP.

    2. Head-of-line blocking and receive buffer blocking: Problem 
       Description 

    2.1. Example Description 

       We present a specific example which illustrates the head-of-line 
       blocking and receive buffer blocking problem in the concurrent multi-
       path transfer. 

       Consider the architecture shown below: 

              -------                _________                  _____ 

             |      |                /         \               |      | 

             |      |A1 <============== Path 1 ============> B1|      | 

             |      |<------------->|           |<------------>|      |

             |      |               |           |              |      |

             |      |A2 <============== Path 2 ============> B2|      | 

             |      |                \_________/               |      | 

              ------                                            ------ 

                          Figure 1: Example Architecure 

       SCTP endpoints A and B have an association between them. Both 
       endpoints are multihomed, A posses network interfaces A1 and A2,and B 
       posses interfaces B1 and B2. More precisely, A1, A2, B1 and B2 are 
       associated with link layer interfaces. A1 and B1, A2 and B2 are bound 
       to one SCTP association. in this example, We assume that the data 
       traffic are transmitted through these four interfaces simultaneously. 
       Thus it forms two paths: path1 is the data traffic from A to B1 which 
       is routed through A1, and path2 is the data traffic from A to B2 
       which is routed through A2. Both path1 and path2 have a certain  
       packet loss rate. Each host has one transport receive buffer. 

       Now, consider the following sequence of events: 
     
     
    Zhang                  Expires March 16, 2009                 [Page 4]

       1) 
  The sender (host A) initially sends data to the receiver (host B) 
          using both destination address B1 and B2. 
       2) 
  Because there is only one receive buffer, if there is a path 
          failure or packet error occurred on the path1, the receiver has to 
          wait for retransmissions to come through, and is unable to deliver 
          subsequent TSNs to the application (some of which were sent over 
          path1). These subsequent TSNs (time sequence number) are held in 
          the transport layer receive buffer and the peer-rwnd(receive 
          window) is reduced sharply, so the path2 gets into congestion. 
          Thus path2 causes blocking of the receive buffer, preventing data 
          from being sent on either path and reduce over all throughput. 

       3) 
 If there are multiple data streams exist in one SCTP association, 
          consecutive TSN number may be assigned to different streams. For 
          example, stream1 is assigned TSN number 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and stream2 
          is assigned TSN number 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. If receiver receives data 
          packets with TSN number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, it can deliver 
          the data of the stream 1 to application absolutely, because data 
          stream is SCTP protocol is completely logic independently. But in 
          real transfer process in traditional transport protocol, the 
          receiver has to wait data packet with TSN number 6 and 8. This 
          instance causes the head-of-line blocking problem. 

    2.2. Discussion 

       The receive buffer blocking and head-of-line blocking problems are 
       existed in all traditional CMT transfer. The essential of this 
       problem is that all paths using a shared buffer and global variable 
       TSN is used to calculate the receive order of each path. 

    3. 
       Transmission mechanism and path selection of WCMT-SCTP 

    3.1.Transmission mechanism of WCMT-SCTP 

       WCMT-SCTP protocol has the following characters: 

       1) WCMT-SCTP has multi send buffers and multi receive buffers. 

       2) WCMT-SCTP has a per-path congestion control mechanism. The 
       original SCTP only allows for CWND adjustments when the association 
       cumulative TSN Ack point is updated by an incoming SACK. This is 
       correct when at most one path is used at any given time and 
       consecutive packets arrive in order at the receiver, but in the CMT 
       situation, the assumption of ordered reception does not hold anymore, 
       and SACKs, may acknowledge one or more chunks that were received in 
       order on different paths, which do not update the association

       cumulative TSN Ack point. This problem can be easily solved by 
       introducing a per-path Ack point and updating it after processing a 
       meaningful SACK. 

       3) In order to solve the receive buffer blocking and head-of-line 
       blocking problems in the CMT situation, it proposed to bind one of 
       multiple data streams with one of the multi-path. The sender can 
       transfer multiple data streams in the same time, but if there is no 
       path failure packet loss is reported, the certain data stream can 
       only be transferred on the certain path. 

       4) In WCMT-SCTP, the protocol uses stream identifier (SID) and path 
       sequence number (PSN) instead of TSN as the adjustment of CWND. 
       Because the data stream is bind with the path, so using these two 
       parameters can uniquely identify per-path CWND. 

       5) The retransmission mechanism of WCMT-SCTP protocol is different as 
       used in original SCTP protocol. It depends on types of packet loss. 

    3.2.The retransmission mechanism of WCMT-SCTP protocol 

    3.2.1 Distinguish different types of packet loss 

       In wireless network, packet losses can be categorized as three major 
       types. 

       Congestion loss: It occurs in the transmit nodes in wireless networks 
       because of bandwidth and buffer limitations that result in buffer 
       over-flows. In wireless network, it could not be the main reason of 
       packet loss. 

       Error Loss: It occurs at random over a wireless channel due to 
       transmission errors, caused mainly by impairments such as noise, 
       interference and multi-path fading.  

       Path failure loss: It occurs in the situation that the original path 
       is inexistence and packets are re-routed to the new path. Consecutive 
       packets may be lost due to futile transmissions over old path. Path 
       failure loss is also one of the main sources of packet losses in 
       wireless communication. 

       The difference between path failure loss and congestion loss as well 
       as error loss is that path failure loss is usually detected by a time 
       out, while error loss and congestion loss are detected by a sender 
       receiving duplicate SACKs.

    3.2.2 Retransimission Mechanism of WCMT-SCTP 

       When the packet loss is detected by receiving duplicate SACKs, a 
       WCMT-SCTP sender uses a failure detection threshold called DMR (data 
       max  retransmission).  When  a  sender  experiences  more  than  DMR 
       consecutive retransmission of the same loss packets and no one is 
       succeed, it will try to reach other active destination, the original 
       destination is marked as failed. Only heartbeats are sent to the 
       failed destination. The original destination returns to the active 
       state when the sender receives a heartbeat ack from the destination 
       again. The default DMR value of WCMT-SCTP is 3. The finite state 
       machine is shown below:  

                      ----------------------- 
                     |    Path is "Active"   |<-----

                     ----------------------         | 
                                |                   | 
                                | Yes               | 
                               \|/                  | 
                      ----------------------    No  |

                      ---------------------- 
                                | 
                                | Yes 
                               \|/ 
                     ------------------------ 
                   /     Path is "Failure"    \ 
                   |   Change to a New Path   | 
                   \                          / 
                     ------------------------ 
        

       When the path is failure, the packet loss is detected by timeout. In 
       this situation, if twice consecutive timeout is happened, the 
       original destination is marked as failed immediately, and the sender 
       will try to reach a new active destination. The status of failed 
       destination turns into active is as same as that of error loss 
       process. The finite state machine is shown below:

    3.3.Path selection 

    3.3.1 The trigger of path selection 

       When the total number of available transmission paths is more than the 
       number of paths that needs to be used for WCMT-SCTP, i.e., the path 
       number is larger than the number of data streams. a path selection 
       mechanism is needed to select which paths should be used. The path 
       selection mechanism can be triggered in the following conditions: 

        1. Association initiation: the initial setup of an association in a 
           multihomed host to start the data transmission. 

        2. New path added: a new path is discovered as available and added 
           into the association. 

        3. Path inactive: A path that is used by WCMT-SCTP is determined as 
           "inactive" by the association. 

     3.3.2 Path selection mechanism 

       In condition "Association Initiation", when the multihomed host is 
       going to setup an association, the multihomed host connects to its 
       peer endpoint using one of its available addresses. Then the 
       multihomed host exchanges the information of all available IP 
       addresses with its peer endpoint in initialization. When the

       initialization is complete, WCMT-SCTP triggers the path selection 
       mechanism to select the paths which has the minimum RTT time to use 
       for the following transmission. If the number of data streams is 
       smaller than or equal to the path number, one path will bind with one 
       data streams. If the number of data streams is less than the path 
       number, some of the largest bandwidth paths will bind with more than 
       one data streams. 

       Condition "New path added" occurs when the multihomed host added a 
       new IP and found a new path between source and receiver. The path 
       selection mechanism can be triggered to determine whether the newly 
       added transmission path is better than the one that is currently used. 

       Condition "Path inactive" occurs when one of the transmit paths 
       repeatlly fails and determined as "inactive" by the association. Thus, 
       WCMT-SCTP will trigger the path selection mechanism to select another 
       transmission path to replace the failed path. 

    4. 
       Modifications to SCTP 

       On the basis of the aforementioned issues and design, some 
       modifications must be made to SCTP to solve the problems and support 
       the new features of WCMT-SCTP. 

    4.1.Chunks format modifications 

       A new parameter path sequence number (PSN) is used to substitute 
       transmit sequence number (TSN). PSN represents sequence of SCTP data 
       chunk transmitted through a path, it has similar function as TSN in 
       standard SCTP.  

       The data chunk format of WCMT-SCTP is defined as follows: 

        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-++-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

       The time stamp is used to determine the order of the SACKs, the 
       receiver of the old SACK does not update its view of the rwnd of the 
       peer.  

    4.2.Congestion control mechanism changed in WCMT-SCTP 

     PSN is used in WCMT-SCTP for congestion control. The sender keeps a 
     mapping relationship table between stream identifiers (SID) and the 
     corresponding paths. So the protocol can use PSN and SID instead of TSN 
     to achieve the congestion control mechanism on each path. 

      The CWND updating mechanism and gap report process of WCMT-SCTP is as 
      follows : 

     Sender Side Behavior: 

    (1)CWND updating on SACKs 

         On receipt of a SACK 

          for each destination di 

           for each PSN being acked by the SACK and yet not been acked do

    Internet-Draft               <WCMT-SCTP>                September 2008 
        

               if PSN.dst=di     then 

               di.num_acked_PSN_old=di.num_acked_PSN 

               increment di.num_acked_PSN by1; 

               if(SIDi_PSNn_outstanding=TRUE)    then 

               Decrement di.num_out_SIDi by 1; 

                  end 

               end 

           end 

       increment di.CWND by min(di.num_acked_PSN-di.num_acked_PSN_old,PMTU); 

        end 

        

    (2)GAP Report Process 

       On receipt of a SACK with GAP reports: 

          for each SIDi_PSNm that are reported as missing do 

             if(SIDi_PSNn_outstanding=TRUE&&di_num_out_SIDi!=0)  then 

                increment the missing report count for SIDi_SSNm; 

             else  

                do not increment the missing report count for SIDi_PSNm; 

             end 

       end 

    4.3.Path handover notification changed in WCMT-SCTP 

       The SCTP ADDIP Extention allows an SCTP host to dynamically add, 
       delete, and change the primary address of ongoing association without 
       interrupting it. But the ADDIP Extention function is only used for 
       the situation of one primary path used. In multiple primary paths 
       situation,new chunk type to announce which primary path has to be

       replaced.(this need a new chunk type, we can discuss the format of 
       the new chunk)  

    4.4.Other modifications have to be taken in WCMT-SCTP 

       In order to avoid spurious retransmission, SACKs must be sent to the 
        new destination address after the path handover occurs at the sender. 

       The CWND of the sender should not grow when receiving the 
        acknowledgments of the PSNs that are transmitted through the old 
        path after the path handover occurs at the sender. 

    5. 
       Further considerations 

        For the practical implementation of WCMT-SCTP, path selection should 
        be performed for each type of the wireless access technology. But 
        the WCMT-SCTP can not know which access technology the host use, so 
        the probability solution is using cross layer design. For example, 
        in the process of association established, the initial transport 
        packet can take some information of routing layer or PHY/MAC layer. 
        Thus the path selection mechanism can be successful performed.
