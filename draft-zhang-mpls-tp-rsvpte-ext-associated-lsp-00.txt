Internet-Draft    RSVP-TE Extentions of Associated LSP        March 2010


1.  Introduction

   According to [RFC5654], the MPLS-TP's control plane MUST support
   establishing associated bidirectional P2P LSP.  Furthermore, this
   requirement is elaborated as follows, and repeated in
   [tp-cp-framework]:

   10 All nodes on the path of a co-routed bidirectional transport path
   in the same (sub)layer as the path MUST be aware of the pairing
   relationship of the forward and the backward directions of the
   transport path.

   11 The end points of an associated bidirectional transport path MUST
   be aware of the pairing relationship of the forward and reverse paths
   used to support the bidirectional service.

   12 Nodes on the path of an associated bidirectional transport path
   where both the forward and backward directions transit the same node
   in the same (sub)layer as the path SHOULD be aware of the pairing
   relationship of the forward and the backward directions of the
   transport path.

   Although the co-routed bidirectional LSP always exists in transport
   networks, but the forward and backward paths are signalled/routed
   independently in IP/MPLS networks.  In this situation, the
   association is useful for protection switching, for OAM that requires
   a reply (from MIP or MEP), and for defect correlation.

   The ASSOCIATION object, as defined in [RFC4872] and [RFC4873]
   respectively, is used to provide end-to-end and segment recovery.
   This document extends the ASSOCIATION object to realize dynamic
   binding control of associated bidirectional LSP.


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119.


3.   Extension to the ASSOCIATION object.

   The ASSOCIATION object is used to associate LSPs with each other.

   The IPv4 ASSOCIATION object (Class-Num of the form 11bbbbbb with
   value = 199, C-Type = 1) has the format:

                     Figure 2: IPv6 ASSOCIATION object

   Now, the following values of the Association Type have been defined.


                         Value      Type
                         -----      ----
                         0         Reserved

                         2         Resource sharing


   In order to bind two reverse unidirectional LSPs to be an associated
   bidirectional LSP, this document defined two new values:





Zhang, et al.           Expires September 2, 2010               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft    RSVP-TE Extentions of Associated LSP        March 2010


                  Value      Type
                  -----      ----
                  3       Association (master/slave mode)
                  4       Association (peer mode)


   Just likes the other two types, these newly defined Association Types
   are only carried in PATH messages also, such identification only
   takes place based on PATH state.

   An ASSOCIATION object with an Association Type set to the value
   "Association" is used to bind two reverse unidirectional LSP to be an
   associated bidirectional LSP.  Any node originating a LSP need to be
   bound MUST insert an ASSOCIATION object with the following setting:

   The Association Type MUST be set to the value "Association" in the
   Path message of the LSP.

   The Association ID MUST be set to be set to a value that uniquely
   identifies the association of LSPs, this SHOULD be set to the Tunnel
   ID of the bound LSP (master/slave mode) or the Tunnel ID of the
   binding LSP (peer mode).

   The (IPv4/IPv6) Association Source SHOULD be set to the Tunnel Sender
   Address of the bound LSP (master/slave mode) or the Tunnel Sender
   Address of the binding LSP (peer mode), MAY be set to the Tunnel End
   Point Address.

   Terminating (the same transit) nodes MUST (SHOULD) use received
   ASSOCIATION object(s) with the Association Type set to the value
   "Association" to bind the two reverse unidirectional LSPs together.

   Once included, an ASSOCIATION object with an Association Type
   "Association" SHOULD NOT be removed from the PATH messages associated
   with an LSP.

   Any node processing a PATH message which contains an ASSOCIATION
   object with an Association type, examines existing LSPs for matching
   Association Type, Association Source, and Association ID values.  If
   any match is found, then dynamic binding of the two reverse LSPs
   SHOULD be provided.


4.  Operation

   Consider the following example:

Internet-Draft    RSVP-TE Extentions of Associated LSP        March 2010


                             A-------D-------B
                              \     /
                               \   /
                                \ /
                                 C


           Figure 3: An Example of Associated Bidirectional LSP

   Two reverse unidirectional LSPs are established, the forward LSP1 is
   from A to B over [A,D,B], and the associated backward LSP2 is from B
   to A over [B,D,C,A].

4.1.  Master/slave mode

   In this mode, the ingress node sends the PATH message, inserting
   ASSOCIATION object; and the egress node sets up a backward LSP
   triggered by the ASSOCIATION object.  That is to say, the ingress
   node can actively setup the forward LSP and trigger the egress node
   to setup backward LSP.

   The procedure can be as follows::

   (1) Node A sends PATH message of LSP1, inserting the ASSOCIATION
   object.  Association Type is set to Association, Association ID is
   the Tunnel ID of LSP1, and Association Source is the Tunnel Sender
   Address, for example, the IP address of Node A.

   (2) When node D receives the PATH message of LSP1, it needs to check
   ASSOCIATION object.  If it does not know this Association Type, just
   ignore it and forward it to the next node.  Of course, Node D can
   send PathErr Message indicating that it does not know this
   Association Type, but this would increase the failed possibility of
   establishing LSP1.  If the Association Type is Association, it
   indicates that Node D should bind one backward LSP with LSP1 to form
   an associated bidirectional LSP if it is the same node of these two
   LSPs.

   (3)Similarly with node D, when node B receives the PATH message of
   LSP1, it needs to check ASSOCIATION object also.  For node B is the
   end point of LSP1 with master/slave mode, and it SHOULD be triggered
   to set up the backward LSP2 to bind it with LSP1.  So it sends PATH
   message of LSP2, inserting the ASSOCIATION object, which has the same
   value as it is in the PATH message of LSP1.  In other words,
   Association Type is Association, Association ID is Tunnel ID1,
   Association Source is the IP address of node A.

   (4) When node D receives the PATH message of LSP2, it checks

Internet-Draft    RSVP-TE Extentions of Associated LSP        March 2010


   ASSOCIATION object and finds that it needs to bind LSP2 with another
   LSP, examining existing LSPs for matching Association Type,
   Association ID and Association Source.  Obviously, LSP1 and LSP2
   match with each other, so they will be bound together.

   (5) For node C, because it is not the same middle node of LSP1 and
   LSP2, so it can not find matched LSPs, but this does not affect the
   setting up of the two reverse unidirectional LSPs.

   (6)Node A behaves the same with node D, except that it is the end
   point of LSP2.

4.2.  Peer mode

   In this mode, the ingress node sends the PATH message, inserting
   ASSOCIATION object, indicating to bind which backward LSP with the
   forward LSP.  Then the egress node sets up the corresponding backward
   LSP with the Tunnel ID carried in the ASSOCIATION object of the
   forward LSP, and there is no need to insert the ASSOCIATION object in
   the PATH message of the backward LSP.  Ingress/egress and the same
   transit node compare the Tunnel ID carried in the ASSOCIATION object
   of the forward LSP and the Tunnel ID of the backward LSP, and bind
   them together if the two Tunnel IDs are the same.

4.3.  Acknowledgement of the binding

   In the description above, The Ingress node do not know whether the
   binding of the Egress and the same transit nodes are successful or
   not.  This can be done by putting the ASSOCIATION object in the RESV
   refresh message of the bound LSP if the binding is successful.


5.   IANA Considerations

   Within the current document, a new Association Type is defined.


6.  Security Considerations

   TBD.


7.  Acknowledgement

   The author would like to thank Xihua, Fu and Bo, Wu for their useful
   discussion.
