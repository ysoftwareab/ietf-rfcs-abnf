2. Abstract

   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [1] is an inter-Autonomous System
   routing protocol. The primary function of a BGP speaking system is to
   exchange network reachability information with other BGP systems.

   It has recently been discovered that in particular configurations,
   the BGP scaling mechanisms defined in "BGP Route Reflection - An
   Alternative to Full Mesh IBGP" [2] and "Autonomous System
   Confederations for BGP" [3] will introduce persistent BGP route
   oscillation[4].  This document discusses the two types of persistent
   route oscillation that have been identified, describes when these
   conditions will occur, and provides some network design guidelines to

   avoid introducing such occurrences.

3. Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [5].

4. Introduction

   It has been known for some time that in particular configurations,
   the BGP scaling mechanisms defined in "BGP Route Reflection - An
   Alternative to Full Mesh IBGP" [2] and "Autonomous System
   Confederations for BGP" [3] will introduce persistent BGP route
   oscillation.

   The persistent route oscillation behavior is deterministic and can be
   avoided by employing some rudimentary BGP network design principles
   until protocol enhancements resolve the problem.

   In the following sections a taxonomy of the types of oscillations is
   presented and a description of the set of conditions that will
   trigger route oscillations is given.  We continue by providing
   several network design alternatives that remove the potential for
   this to occur.

   It is the intent of the authors that this document serve to increase
   operator awareness of the problem, as well as to trigger discussion
   and subsequent proposals for potential protocol enhancements that
   remove the possibly for this to occur.

   The oscillations are classified into Type I and Type II depending
   upon criteria documented below.

5. Type I Discussion

   In the following two subsections we provide configurations under
   which Type I Churn will occur.  We begin with a discussion of the
   problem when using Route Reflection, and then discuss the problem as
   it relates to AS Confederations.

   In general, Type I Churn occurs only when BOTH of the following
   conditions are met:

    1) a single-level Route Reflection or AS Confederations
       design is used in the network AND

    2) the network accepts the BGP MULTI_EXIT_DISC (MED)

       attribute from two or more ASs for a single prefix
       and the MED values are unique.

   It is also possible for the non-deterministic ordering of paths to
   cause the route oscillation problem.  [1] does not specify that paths
   should be ordered based on MEDs but it has been proven that non-
   deterministic ordering can lead to loops and inconsistent routing
   decisions.   Most vendors have either implemented deterministic
   ordering as default behavior, or provide a knob that permits the
   operator to configure the router to order paths in a deterministic
   manner based on MEDs.


5.1. Route Reflection and Type I Churn

   We now discuss Type I oscillation as it relates to Route Reflection.
   To begin, consider the topology depicted in Figure 1:

       Figure 1: Example Route Reflection Topology




   In Figure 1 AS1 contains two Route Reflector Clusters, Clusters 1 and
   2.  Each Cluster contains one Route Reflector (RR) (i.e., Ra and Rd,
   respectively).  An associated 'RR' in parentheses represents each RR.
   Cluster 1 contains two RR Clients (Rb and Rc), and Cluster 2 contains
   one RR Client (Re).  An associated 'C' in parentheses indicates RR
   Client status.  The dotted lines are used to represent BGP peering
   sessions.

   The number contained in parentheses on the AS1 EBGP peering sessions
   represents the MED value advertised by the peer to be associated with
   the 10.0.0.0/8 network reachability advertisement.

   The number proceeding each '*' on the IBGP peering sessions

   represents the additive IGP metrics that are to be associated with
   the BGP NEXT_HOP attribute for the concerned route.  For example, the
   Ra IGP metric value associated with a NEXT_HOP learned via Rb would
   be 5; while the metric value associated with the NEXT_HOP learned via
   Re would be 13.

   Table 1 depicts the 10.0.0.0/8 route attributes as seen by routers
   Rb, Rc and Re, respectively.  Note that the IGP metrics in Figure 1
   are only of concern when advertising the route to an IBGP peer.


     Router  MED  AS_PATH
     --------------------
     Rb       10   10 100
     Rc        1    6 100
     Re        0    6 100

     Table 1: Route Attribute Table


   For the following steps 1 through 5 the best path will be marked with
   a '*'.

     1) Ra has the following installed in its BGP table with
        the path learned via AS2 marked best:

                       NEXT_HOP
        AS_PATH  MED   IGP Cost
        -----------------------
          6 100    1          4
       * 10 100   10          5

        The '10 100' route should not be marked as best, though
        this is not the cause of the persistent route oscillation.
        Ra realizes it has the wrong route marked as best since the
        '6 100' path has a lower IGP metric.  As such, Ra makes this
        change and advertises an UPDATE message to its neighbors to
        let them know that it now considers the '6 100, 1, 4' route
        as best.

     2) Rd receives the UPDATE from Ra, which leaves Rd with the
        following installed in its BGP table:

                       NEXT_HOP
        AS_PATH  MED   IGP Cost
        -----------------------
       *  6 100    0         12
          6 100    1          5



McPherson, Gill, Walton, Retana                        	[Page 5]

INTERNET DRAFT                                            December 2000


        Rd then marks the '6 100, 0, 12' route as best because it has
        a lower MED.  Rd sends an UPDATE message to its neighbors to
        let them know that this is the best route.


     3) Ra receives the UPDATE message from Rd and now has the
        following in its BGP table:

                       NEXT_HOP
        AS_PATH  MED   IGP Cost
        -----------------------
          6 100    0         13
          6 100    1          4
       * 10 100   10          5

        The first route (6 100, 0, 13) beats the second route (6 100,
        1, 4) because of lower MED, then the third route (10 100, 10,
        5) beats the first route because of lower IGP metric to
        NEXT_HOP.  Ra sends an UPDATE message to its peers to let them
        know its new best route.


     4) Rd receives the UPDATE message from Rc, which leaves Rd with the
        following BGP table:

                       NEXT_HOP
        AS_PATH  MED   IGP Cost
        -----------------------
          6 100    0         12
       * 10 100   10          6

        Rd selects the '10 100, 10, 6' path as best because of the IGP
        metric.  Rd sends an UPDATE/withdraw to its peers to let them
        know this is its best route.


     5) Ra receives the UPDATE message from Rd, which leaves Ra with the
        following BGP table:

                       NEXT_HOP
        AS_PATH  MED   IGP Cost
        -----------------------
          6 100    1          4
       * 10 100   10          5

        Ra received a withdraw for '6 100, 0, 13', which changes what is
        considered the best route for Ra.
        This is why Ra has the '10 100, 10, 5' route selected as best in

        Step 1, even though '6 100, 1, 4' is actually better.


   At this point, we've made a full loop and are back at Step 1.  The
   router realizes it is using the incorrect best path, and the cycle
   repeats.  This is an example of Type I Churn when using Route Reflec-
   tion.

5.2. AS Confederations and Type I Churn

   We'll now provide an example of Type I Churn occurring with AS Con-
   federations.  To begin, consider the topology depicted in Figure 2:

   For example, the Ra IGP metric value associated with a NEXT_HOP
   learned via Rb would be 5; while the metric value associated with the
   NEXT_HOP learned via Re would be 13.

   Table 2 depicts the 10.0.0.0/8 route attributes as seen by routers
   Rb, Rc and Re, respectively.  Note that the IGP metrics in Figure 2
   are only of concern when advertising the route to an IBGP peer.

    Table 2: Route Attribute Table


   For the following steps 1 through 6 the best route will be marked
   with an '*'.

     1) Ra has the following BGP table:


                               NEXT_HOP
                AS_PATH  MED   IGP Cost

                  6 100    1          2

        The '10 100' route is selected as best and advertised to
        Rd, though this is not the cause of the persistent route
        oscillation.

     2) Rd has the following in its BGP table:

                AS_PATH  MED   IGP Cost
        -------------------------------

       * (65000) 10 100    10         4

        The "(65000) 10 100' route is selected as best because it has
        the lowest IGP metric.  As a result, Rd sends an UPDATE/withdraw
        to Ra for the '6 100' route that it had previously advertised.

     3) Ra receives the withdraw from Rd.  Ra now has the following in

        its BGP table:

                               NEXT_HOP
                AS_PATH  MED   IGP Cost
        -------------------------------
       *         10 100   10          3
                  6 100    1          2

        Ra received a withdrawal for '(65001) 6 100', which changes what
        is considered the best route for Ra.  Ra does not compute the
        best path for a prefix unless its best route was withdrawn.
        This is why Ra has the '10 100, 10, 3' route selected as best,
        even though the '6 100, 1, 2' route is better.

     4) Ra realizes that the '6 100' route is better because of the
        lower IGP metric.  Ra sends an UPDATE/withdraw to Rd for the '10
        100' route since Ra is now using the '6 100' path as its best
        route.

        Ra's BGP table looks like this:

                               NEXT_HOP
                AS_PATH  MED   IGP Cost
        -------------------------------
                 10 100   10          3
       *          6 100    1          2

     5) Rd receives the UPDATE from Ra and now has the following in
        its BGP table:

                               NEXT_HOP
                AS_PATH  MED   IGP Cost
        -------------------------------
          (65000) 6 100    1          4
       *          6 100    0          5

        Rd selects the '6 100, 0, 5' route as best because of the lower
        MED value.  Rd sends an UPDATE message to Ra, reporting that
        '6 100, 0 5' is now its best route.

     6) Ra receives the UPDATE from Rd.  Ra now has the following in its
        BGP table:

                               NEXT_HOP
                AS_PATH  MED   IGP Cost
        -------------------------------
       *         10 100   10          3
          (65001) 6 100    0          7

       At this point we have made a full cycle and are back to step 1.
       This is an example of Type I Churn with AS Confederations.

5.3. Potential Workarounds for Type I Churn

   There are a number of alternatives that can be employed to provide
   workarounds to this problem:

    1) When using Route Reflection make sure that the inter-Cluster
       links have a higher IGP metric than the intra-Cluster links.
       This is the preferred choice when using Route Reflection. Had
       the inter-Cluster IGP metrics been much larger than the intra-
       Cluster IGP metrics, the above would not have occurred.

    2) When using AS Confederations ensure that the inter-Sub-AS
       links have a higher IGP metric than the intra-Sub-AS links.
       This is the preferred option when using AS Confederations.
       Had the inter-Sub-AS IGP metrics been much larger than the
       intra-Sub-AS IGP metrics, the above would not have occurred.

    3) Do not accept MEDs from peers (this may not be a feasible
       alternative).

    4) Utilize other BGP attributes higher in the decision process
       so that the BGP decision algorithm never reaches the MED
       step.  As using this completely overrides MEDs, Option 3 may make
       more sense.

    5) Always compare BGP MEDs, regardless of whether or not they were
       obtained from a single AS.  This is probably a bad idea since
       MEDs may be derived in a number of ways, and are typically done
       so as a matter of operator-specific policy.  As such, comparing
       MED values for a single prefix learned from multiple ASs is
       ill-advised.  Of course, this mostly defeats the purpose of MEDs,
       and as such, Option 3 may be a more viable alternative.

    6) Use a full IBGP mesh.  This is not a feasible solution for
       ASs with a large number of BGP speakers.

6. Type II Discussion

   In the following subsection we provide configurations under which
   Type II Churn will occur when using AS Confederations.  For sake of
   brevity, we avoid similar discussion of the occurrence when using
   Route Reflection.

   In general, Type II churn occurs only when BOTH of the following con-
   ditions are met:

    1) More than one tier of Route Reflection or Sub-ASs
       is used in the network AND

    2) the network accepts the BGP MULTI_EXIT_DISC (MED)
       attribute from two or more ASs for a single prefix
       and the MED values are unique.

6.1. AS Confederations and Type II Churn

   Let's now examine the occurrence of Type II Churn as it relates to AS
   Confederations.  Figure 3 provides our sample topology:

     Figure 3: Example AS Confederations Topology



   In Figure 3 AS N contains three Sub-ASs, 65500, 65501 and
   65502. No RR is used within the Sub-AS, and as such, all routers
   within each Sub-AS are fully meshed. Ra and Rb are members of Sub-AS
   65501.  Rc and Rd are members of Sub-AS 65500. Ra and Rg are EBGP
   peering with AS Y, router Rf has an EBGP peering with AS X. The
   dotted lines are used to represent BGP peering sessions.

   The number proceeding each '*' on the BGP peering sessions
   represents the additive IGP metrics that are to be associated with
   the BGP NEXT_HOP.  The number contained in parentheses on each AS N
   EBGP peering session represents the MED value advertised by the peer
   to be associated with the network reachability advertisement(s).

   Rc, Rd and Re are the primary routers involved in the churn, and as
   such, will be the only BGP tables that we will monitor step by step.

   For the following steps 1 through 8 each routers best route will be

                   * Y    1          2


        Re will advertise his new best path to Rd.

     2) The 'Y0' path was passed from Ra to Rb, and then from Rb
        to Rc.  Rd learns the 'Y1' path from Re.  Rc selects 'Y0',
        Rd selects 'Y1'.

                   * Y    1          2


     3) Rc and Rd advertise their best paths to each other;
        Rd selects 'Y0' because of MED.

                   * Y    1          2


        Rd has a new best path so he will send an advertisement
        to Re and send a withdraw for 'Y1' to Rc.


     4) Re selects 'X' per 'Y0' beats 'Y1' because of the MED.
        'X' beats 'Y0' because of IGP metric.

       MEDs may be derived in a number of ways, and are typically done
       so as a matter of operator-specific policy and largely a function
       of available metric space provided by the employed IGP.  As such,
       comparing MED values for a single prefix learned from multiple
       ASs is ill-advised.  This mostly defeats the purpose of MEDs;
       Option 1 may be a more viable alternative.

    4) Future drafts will propose other solutions for Type II Churn

7. Future Works

   It should be stated that protocol enhancements regarding this problem
   must be pursued.  Imposing network design requirements such as those
   outlined above are clearly an unreasonable long-term solution.  Prob-
   lems such as this should not occur under 'default' configurations.
