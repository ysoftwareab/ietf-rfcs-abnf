Internet-Draft         DetNet Data Plane Framework              May 2019


1.  Introduction

   Deterministic Networking (DetNet) provides a capability to carry
   specified unicast or multicast data flows for real-time applications
   with extremely low packet loss rates and assured maximum end-to-end
   delivery latency.  A description of the general background and
   concepts of DetNet can be found in [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture].

   This document describes the concepts needed by any DetNet data plane
   specification and provides considerations for any corresponding
   implementation.  It covers the building blocks that provide the
   DetNet service, the forwarding sub-layer functions, and the flow
   identification as described in the DetNet Architecture.

   The DetNet Architecture models the DetNet related data plane
   functions decomposed into two sub-layers: a service sub-layer and a
   forwarding sub-layer.  The service sub-layer is used to provide
   DetNet service protection and reordering.  The forwarding sub-layer
   is used to provide congestion protection (low loss, assured latency,
   and limited reordering) and leverages Traffic Engineering mechanisms.

   As part of the service sub-layer functions, this document describes
   typical DetNet node data plane operation.  It describes the function
   and operation of the Packet Replication (PRF) Packet Elimination
   (PEF) and the Packet Ordering (POF) functions within the service sub-
   layer.  It also describes the forwarding sub-layer that is used to
   eliminate (or reduce) contention loss and provide bounded latency for
   DetNet flows.

   DetNet flows may be carried over network technologies that can
   provide the DetNet required level of service.  For example, DetNet
   MPLS flows can be carried over IEEE 802.1 Time Sensitive Network
   (TSN) [IEEE802.1TSNTG] sub-networks.  However, IEEE 802.1 TSN support
   is not required and some of the DetNet benefits can be gained by
   running over a data link layer that has not been specifically
   enhanced to support TSN.

   Different traffic types, or application flows, can be mapped on top
   of DetNet.  DetNet can optionally reuse header information provided
   by, or shared with, applications.  An example of shared header fields
   can be found in [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip].

   This document also covers concepts related to the controller plane
   and Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) functions.

3.  DetNet Data Plane Overview

   This document describes how application flows, or app-flows, are
   carried over DetNet networks.  The DetNet Architecture,
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture], models the DetNet related data plane
   functions decomposed into two sub-layers: a service sub-layer and a
   forwarding sub-layer.

   Figure 1 reproduced from the [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture],shows a
   logical DetNet service with the two sub-layers.

                Figure 1: DetNet data plane protocol stack

   The DetNet forwarding sub-layer may be directly provided by the
   DetNet service sub-layer, for example by IP or MPLS.  Alternatively
   an overlay approach may be used in which the packet is natively
   carried between key nodes within the DetNet network (say between
   PREOF nodes) and a sub-layer is used to provide the information
   needed to reach the next hop in the overlay.

   This forwarding sub-layer provides the quality underpin needed by the
   DetNet Service sub-layer.  It may do this directly through the use of
   queuing techniques and traffic engineering methods, or it may do this
   through the assistance of its underlying connectivity.  For example
   it may call upon Ethernet TSN capabilities defined in IEEE 802.1 TSN
   [IEEE802.1TSNTG].

   The service sub-layer provides additional support beyond the
   connectivity function of the forwarding sub-layer.  An example of

   this is Packet Replication, Elimination, and Ordering (PREOF)
   function see Section 4.5.

   The method of instantiating each of the layers is specific to the
   particular DetNet data plane method.  There may be more than approach
   that is applicable to a given bearer network type.

3.1.  Data Plane Characteristics

   There are two major characteristics to the data plane:

   1.  How the data plane is constructed: The DetNet service sub-layer
       provides its functions for the DetNet application flows by using
       or applying existing standardized headers and/or encapsulations.
       The Detnet forwarding sub-layer may provide capabilities
       leveraging that same header or encapsulation technology e.g.
       Figure 2 or it may be achieved by other standardized technologies
       e.g.  Figure 3.

   2.  Extensibility of that Data Plane: Whether or not the DetNet data
       plane includes the facility to carry additional information
       (metadata) that can be used to provide an enhanced service to the
       DetNet packet.

Internet-Draft         DetNet Data Plane Framework              May 2019


3.2.  Encapsulation

   The encapsulation of the DetNet flows allows them to be sent over a
   data plane of a type other than their native type.  Encapsulation is
   essential if, for example, it is required to send Ethernet TSN stream
   as a DetNet Application over a data plane such as MPLS.  Figure 3
   illustrates some encapsulation combinations.

   The use of encapsulation is also required if additional information
   (meta-data) is needed by the DetNet data plane and their is either no
   ability to include it in the client data packet, or the specification
   of the client data plane does not permit the modification of the
   packet to include additional data.  An example of such meta-data is
   the inclusion of a sequence number required by the PREOF function.

   Encapsulation is also needed if the DetNet flow or aggregate flow is
   not easily recognised from its encapsulation.

3.3.  Metadata

   Metadata can be a useful way of identifying packets that need to be
   treated as a flow or flow aggregate.  It is also useful as a way of
   including a sequence number the packet for use by the PREOF function
   or as a place to carry OAM indications or OAM information to
   instrument DetNet data plane operation.

   Explicit inclusion of metadata is possible through the use of IP
   options or IP extension headers.  New IP options are almost
   impossible to get standardized or to deploy in an operational network
   and will not be discussed further in this text.  IPv6 extensions
   headers are finding popularity in current IPv6 development work,
   particularly in connection with Segment Routing of IPv6 (SRv6) and IP
   OAM.  The design of a new IPv6 extension header or the modification
   of an existing one is a technique available in the tool box of the
   DetNet IP data plane designer.

   Explicit inclusion of metadata in an IP packet is also possible
   through the inclusion of an MPLS label stack and the MPLS DetNet
   Control Word using one of the methods for carrying MPLS over IP
   [I-D.mpls-over-udp-ip].  This is described in more detail in
   Section 3.6.4.

   Implicit metadata can be included through the use of the network
   programming paradigm [I-D.spring-srv6-network-programming] in which
   the suffix of an IPv6 address is used to encode additional
   information for use by the network of the receiving host.  Examples
   of such information include the sequence number for use by the PREOF
   function, or even all the essential information being included into

   the DetNet over MPLS label stack (the DetNet Control Word and the
   DetNet Service label).

3.4.  DetNet IP Data Plane

   An IP data plane may operate natively or through the use of an
   encapsulation.  There are many IP encapsulations that may be
   interposed between the DetNet data plane IP header and the DetNet
   payload, and it is anticipated that more than one encapsulation may
   be deployed.

   One method of operating an IP DetNet data plane without encapsulation
   is to use "6-tuple" based flow identification, where "6-tuple" refers
   to information carried in IP and higher layer protocol headers.
   General background on the use of IP headers, and "5-tuples", to
   identify flows and support Quality of Service (QoS) can be found in
   [RFC3670].  [RFC7657] also provides useful background on the delivery
   differentiated services (DiffServ) and "tuple" based flow
   identification.  DetNet flow aggregation may be enabled via the use
   of wildcards, masks, prefixes and ranges.  The operation of this
   method is described in detail in [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip].

   The DetNet forwarding plane may use explicit route capabilities and
   traffic engineering capabilities to provide a forwarding sub-layer
   that is responsible for providing resource allocation and explicit
   routes.  It is possible to include metadata in a native IP packet
   explicitly, or implicitly.

3.5.  DetNet MPLS Data Plane

   MPLS provides the ability to forward traffic over implicit and
   explicit paths to the point in the network where the next DetNet
   service sub-layer action needs to take place.  It does this through
   the use of a stack of one or more labels with various forwarding
   semantics.

   MPLS also provides the ability to identify a service instance that is
   used to process the packet through the use of a label that maps the
   packet to a service instance.

   In cases where metadata is needed to process an MPLS encapsulated
   packet at the service sub-layer, this has been been provided through
   the use of a shim layer also called a control word (CW) [RFC4385].
   Although such CWs are frequently 32 bits long, there is no
   architectural constraint on its size of this structure, only the
   requirement that it is fully understood by all parties operating on
   it in the DetNet service sub-layer.  The operation of this method is
   described in detail in [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls].

3.6.  Further DetNet Data Plane Considerations

   This section needs further work.

   This section provides informative considerations related to providing
   DetNet service to flows which are identified based on their header
   information.  At a high level, the following are provided on a per
   flow basis:

   Reservation and Allocation of resources:

      Reservation of resources can allocate resources to specific DetNet
      flows.  This can eliminate packet contention and loss for DetNet
      traffic.  This also can reduce jitter for the DetNet traffic.
      DetNet flows are assumed to behave with respect to the reserved
      traffic profile.  If other traffic shares the link resources, the
      use of (queuing, policing, shaping) policies can be used to ensure
      that the allocation of resources reserved for DetNet is met.
      Queuing and shaping of DetNet traffic could be required to ensure
      that DetNet traffic does not exceed its reserved profile but this
      would impact the DetNet service characteristics.

   Explicit routes:

      Use of a specific path for a flow.  This allows control of the
      network delay by steering the packet with the ability to influence
      the physical path.  Explicit routes complement reservation by
      ensuring that a consistent path can be associated with its
      resources for the duration of that path.  Coupled with the traffic
      mechanism, this limits misordering and bounds latency.  Explicit
      route computation can encompass a wide set of constraints and
      optimize the path for a certain characteristic e.g. highest
      bandwidth or lowest jitter.  In these cases the "best" path for
      any set of characteristics may not be a shortest path.  The
      selection of path can take into account multiple network metrics.
      Some of these metrics are measured and distributed by the routing
      system as traffic engineering metrics.

   Service protection:

      Use of multiple packet streams using multiple paths, for example
      1+1 or 1:1 linear protection.  For DetNet this primarily relates
      to packet replication and elimination capabilities.  Changing the
      explicit path after a failure is detected to an already
      established path in order to restore delivery of the required
      DetNet service characteristics is another protection mechanism for
      example MPLS hitless protection.  Path changes, even in the case
      of failure recovery, can lead to the out of order delivery of data



Varga, et al.           Expires November 6, 2019                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft         DetNet Data Plane Framework              May 2019


      requiring packet ordering functions either within the DetNet
      service or at a high layer in the application traffic.
      Establishment of new paths after a failure is out of scope for
      DetNet services.

   Network Coding:

      Network Coding, not to be confused with network programming,
      comprises several techniques where multiple data flows are
      encoded.  These resulting flows can then be sent on different
      paths.  The encoding operation can combine flows and error
      recovery information.  When the encoded flows are decoded and
      recombined the original flows can be recovered.  Note that Network
      coding uses an alternative to packet by packet PREOF.  Therefore,
      for certain network topologies and traffic loads, Network Coding
      can be used to improve a network's throughput, efficiency,
      latency, and scalability, as well as resilience to partition,
      attacks, and eavesdropping, as compared to traditional methods.
      DetNet could utilized Network coding as an alternative to other
      protection means.  Network coding is often applied in wireless
      networks and is being explored for other network types.

   Load sharing:

      Use of packet by packet distribution of the same DetNet flow over
      multiple paths is not recommended except for the cases listed
      above where PREOF is utilized to improve protection of traffic and
      maintain order.  Packet by packet load sharing, e.g., via ECMP or
      UCMP, impacts ordering and possibly jitter.

   Troubleshooting:

      Since Detnet leverages many different forwarding sub-layers, those
      technologies also support a number of tools to troubleshoot
      connectivity for example, to support identification of misbehaving
      flows.  At the service layer again there are existing mechanisms
      to troubleshoot or monitor flows.  Many of these mechanisms exist
      for IP and MPLS networks.  A client of a DetNet service can
      introduce any monitoring applications which can detect and monitor
      delay and loss.

   Recognize flow(s) for analytics:

      To a large degree this follows the logic in the previous section.
      Analytics can be inherited from the two sub-layers.  At the DetNet
      service edge packet and bit counters e.g. sent, received, dropped,
      and out of sequence are maintained.

Internet-Draft         DetNet Data Plane Framework              May 2019


   Correlate events with flows:

      The provider of a DetNet service may allow other capabilities to
      monitor flows such as more detail loss statistics and time
      stamping of events.  The details of these capabilities are
      currently out of scope for this document.

   Several of these capabilities are expanded upon in more detail below.

3.6.1.  Service Protection

   Service protection allow DetNet services to increase reliability and
   maintain a DetNet Service Assurance in the case of network congestion
   or some failures.  Detnet relies on the underlying technology
   capabilities for various protection schemes.  Protection schemes
   enable partial or complete coverage of the network paths and active
   protection with combinations of PRF, PRE, and POF.

3.6.1.1.  Linear Service Protection

   An example DetNet MPLS network fragment and packet flow is
   illustrated in Figure 4.



            1      1.1       1.1      1.2.1    1.2.1      1.2.2
         CE1----EN1--------R1-------R2-------R3--------EN2-----CE2
                  \           1.2.1 /                   /
                   \1.2     /-----+                   /
                    +------R4------------------------+
                              1.2.2

         Figure 4: Example Packet Flow in DetNet protected Network

   In Figure 4 the numbers are used to identify the instance of a
   packet.  Packet 1 is the original packet, and packets 1.1, and 1.2
   are two first generation copies of packet 1.  Packet 1.2.1 is a
   second generation copy of packet 1.2 etc.  Note that these numbers
   never appear in the packet, and are not to be confused with sequence
   numbers, labels or any other identifier that appears in the packet.
   They simply indicate the generation number of the original packet so
   that its passage through the network fragment can be identified to
   the reader.

   Customer Equipment CE1 sends a packet into the DetNet enabled
   network.  This is packet (1).  Edge Node EN1 encapsulates the packet
   as a DetNet Packet and sends it to Relay node R1 (packet 1.1).  EN1




Varga, et al.           Expires November 6, 2019               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft         DetNet Data Plane Framework              May 2019


   makes a copy of the packet (1.2), encapsulates it and sends this copy
   to Relay node R4.

   Note that along the path from EN1 to R1 there may be zero or more
   nodes which, for clarity, are not shown.  The same is true for any
   other path between two DetNet entities shown in Figure 4 .

   Relay node R4 has been configured to send one copy of the packet to
   Relay Node R2 (packet 1.2.1) and one copy to Edge Node EN2 (packet
   1.2.2).

   R2 receives packet copy 1.2.1 before packet copy 1.1 arrives, and,
   having been configured to perform packet elimination on this DetNet
   flow, forwards packet 1.2.1 to Relay Node R3.  Packet copy 1.1 is of
   no further use and so is discarded by R2.

   Edge Node EN2 receives packet copy 1.2.2 from R4 before it receives
   packet copy 1.2.1 from R2 via relay Node R3.  EN2 therefore strips
   any DetNet encapsulation from packet copy 1.2.2 and forwards the
   packet to CE2.  When EN2 receives the later packet copy 1.2.1 this is
   discarded.

   The above is of course illustrative of many network scenarios that
   can be configured.  Between a pair of relay nodes there may be one or
   more transit nodes that simply forward the DetNet traffic, but these
   are omitted for clarity.

   This example also illustrates 1:1 protection scheme meaning there is
   traffic and path for each segment of the end to end path.  Local
   DetNet relay nodes determine which packets are eliminated and which
   packets are forwarded.  A 1+1 scheme where only one path is used for
   traffic at a time, could use the same topology.  In this case there
   is no PRF function and traffic is switched upon detection of failure.
   An OAM scheme that monitors the paths detects the loss of path or
   traffic is required to initiate the switch.  A POF may still be used
   in this case to prevent misordering of packets.  In both cases the
   protection paths are established and maintained for the duration of
   the DetNet service.

3.6.1.2.  Ring Service Protection

   Ring protection may also be supported if the underlying technology
   supports it.  Many of the same concepts apply however Rings are
   normally 1+1 protection for data efficiency reasons.  [RFC8227] is an
   example of MPLS-TP data plane that supports Ring protection.

3.6.2.  Aggregation Considerations

   The DetNet data plane also allows for the aggregation of DetNet
   flows, to improved scaling by reducing the state per hop.  How this
   is done is data plane or control plane dependent.  When DetNet flows
   are aggregated, transit nodes provide service to the aggregate and
   not on a per-DetNet flow basis.  When aggregating DetNet flows the
   flows should be compatible i.e. the same or very similar QoS and CoS
   characteristics.  In this case, nodes performing aggregation will
   ensure that per-flow service requirements are achieved.

   If bandwidth reservations are used, the sum of the reservations
   should be the sum of all the individual reservations, in other words,
   the reservations should not create an over subscription of bandwidth
   reservation.  If maximum delay bounds are used the system should
   ensure that the aggregate does not exceed the delay bounds of the
   component flows.

   DetNet encapsulation is a data plane mechanism that can be used to
   aggregate traffic.  Encapsulation can either be in the same service
   type or in a different service type see Figure 3 for examples.  When
   an encapsulation is used the choice of reserving a maximum resource
   level and then tracking the services in the aggregated service or
   adjusting the aggregated resources as the services are added is
   implementation and technology specific.

   DetNet flows at edges must be able to handle rejection to an
   aggregation group due to lack of resources as well as conditions
   where general requirements are not satisfied.

3.6.2.1.  IP Aggregation

   IP aggregation has both data plane and controller plane aspects.  For
   the data plane flows may be aggregated for treatment based on shared
   characteristics such as 5-tuple.  Alternatively, an IP encapsulation
   may be used to tunnel an aggregate number of DetNet Flows between
   relay nodes.

3.6.2.2.  MPLS Aggregation

   MPLS aggregation similarly has data plane and controller plane
   aspects.  In the case of MPLS flows are often tunneled in a
   forwarding sub-layer and reservation is associated with that MPLS
   tunnel.

Internet-Draft         DetNet Data Plane Framework              May 2019


3.6.3.  End-System Specific Considerations

   Data-flows requiring DetNet service are generated and terminated on
   end-systems.  Encapsulation depends on application and its
   preferences.  For example, a DetNet MPLS domain the DN functions use
   the d-CWs, S-Labels and F-Labels to provide DetNet services.
   However, an application may exchange further flow related parameters
   (e.g., time-stamp), which are not provided by DN functions.

   As a general rule, DetNet domains are capable of forwarding any
   DetNet flows and the DetNet domain does not mandate the end-system or
   edge system encapsulation format.  Unless there is a proxy of some
   form present, end-systems peer with similar end-systems using the
   same application encapsulation format.  For example, as shown in
   Figure 5, IP applications peer with IP applications and Ethernet
   L2VPN applications peer with Ethernet L2VPN applications.

3.6.4.  Sub-Network Considerations

   Any of the DetNet service types may be transported by another DetNet
   service.  MPLS nodes may interconnected by different sub-network
   technologies, which may include point-to-point links.  Each of these
   sub-network technologies need to provide appropriate service to
   DetNet flows.  In some cases, e.g., on dedicated point-to-point links
   or TDM technologies, all that is required is for a DetNet node to
   appropriately queue its output traffic.  In other cases, DetNet nodes

   will need to map DetNet flows to the flow semantics (i.e.,
   identifiers) and mechanisms used by an underlying sub-network
   technology.  Figure 6 shows several examples of header formats that
   can be used to carry DetNet MPLS flows over different sub-network
   technologies.  L2 represent a generic layer-2 encapsulation that
   might be used on a point-to-point link.  TSN represents the
   encapsulation used on an IEEE 802.1 TSN network, as described in
   [I-D.mpls-over-tsn].  UDP/IP represents the encapsulation used on a
   DetNet IP PSN, as described in [I-D.mpls-over-udp-ip].

4.  Controller Plane (Management and Control) Considerations

4.1.  DetNet Controller Plane Requirements

   While the definition of controller plane for DetNet is out of the
   scope of this document, there are particular considerations and
   requirements for such that result from the unique characteristics of
   the DetNet architecture [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture] and data plane
   as defined herein.

   The primary requirements of the DetNet controller plane are that it
   must be able to:

   o  Instantiate DetNet flows in a DetNet domain (which may include
      some or all of explicit path determination, link bandwidth
      reservations, restricting flows to IEEE 802.1 TSN links, node
      buffer and other resource reservations, specification of required
      queuing disciplines along the path, ability to manage
      bidirectional flows, etc.) as needed for a flow.




Varga, et al.           Expires November 6, 2019               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft         DetNet Data Plane Framework              May 2019


   o  In the case of MPLS Manage DetNet S-Label and F-Label allocation
      and distribution, where the DetNet MPLS encapsulation is in use
      see Section 4.4.

   o  The ability to support DetNet flow aggregation.

   o  Advertise static and dynamic node and link resources such as
      capabilities and adjacencies to other network nodes (for dynamic
      signaling approaches) or to network controllers (for centralized
      approaches).

   o  Scale to handle the number of DetNet flows expected in a domain
      (which may require per-flow signaling or provisioning).

   o  Provision flow identification information at each of the nodes
      along the path.  Flow identification may differ depending on the
      location in the network and the DetNet functionality (e.g. transit
      node vs. relay node).

   These requirements, as stated earlier, could be satisfied using
   distributed control protocol signaling (such as RSVP-TE), centralized
   network management provisioning mechanisms (such as BGP, PCEP, YANG
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-flow-information-model], etc.) or hybrid
   combinations of the two, and could also make use of MPLS-based
   segment routing.

   In the abstract, the results of either distributed signaling or
   centralized provisioning are equivalent from a DetNet data plane
   perspective - flows are instantiated, explicit routes are determined,
   resources are reserved, and packets are forwarded through the domain
   using the DetNet data plane.

   However, from a practical and implementation standpoint, they are not
   equivalent at all.  Some approaches are more scalable than others in
   terms of signaling load on the network.  Some can take advantage of
   global tracking of resources in the DetNet domain for better overall
   network resource optimization.  Some are more resilient than others
   if link, node, or management equipment failures occur.  While a
   detailed analysis of the control plane alternatives is out of the
   scope of this document, the requirements from this document can be
   used as the basis of a later analysis of the alternatives.

4.2.  Generic Controller Plane Considerations

   This section covers control plane considerations that are independent
   of the data plane technology used for DetNet service delivery.





Varga, et al.           Expires November 6, 2019               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft         DetNet Data Plane Framework              May 2019


   While management plane and control planes are traditionally
   considered separately, from the Data Plane perspective there is no
   practical difference based on the origin of flow provisioning
   information, and the DetNet architecture
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture] refers to these collectively as the
   'Controller Plane'.  This document therefore does not distinguish
   between information provided by distributed control plane protocols,
   e.g., RSVP-TE [RFC3209] and [RFC3473], or by centralized network
   management mechanisms, e.g., RestConf [RFC8040], YANG [RFC7950], and
   the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] or any combination
   thereof.  Specific considerations and requirements for the DetNet
   Controller Plane are discussed in Section 4.1.

4.2.1.  Flow Aggregation Control

   Flow aggregation includes aggregation accomplished through the use of
   hierarchical LSPs in MPLS and tunnels, in the case of IP, MPLS and
   TSN, both of which aggregate multiple DetNet flows into a single new
   DetNet flow.  It can also be grouping of IP flows that share 5-tuple
   of 6-tuple attributes or flow identifiers at the DetNet sub-layer.

   Control of aggregation involves a set of procedures not necessarily
   in a strict order:

   o  Traffic engineering resource collection and distribution:

         Available resources are tracked through control plane or
         management plane databases and distributed amongst controllers
         or nodes that can manage resources.

   o  Path computation and resource allocation:

         When DetNet services are provisioned or requested one or more
         paths meeting the requirements are selected and the resources
         verified and recorded.

   o  Resource assignment and data plane co-ordination:

         The assignment of resources along the path depends on the
         technology and it includes assignment of specific links and
         coordination of the queuing and other traffic management
         capabilities.

   o  Assigned Resource recording and updating:






Varga, et al.           Expires November 6, 2019               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft         DetNet Data Plane Framework              May 2019


         Depending on the specific technology the assigned resources are
         updated and distributed in the databases preventing over
         subscription.

4.2.2.  Explicit Routes

   Explicit routes are used to ensure that packets are routed through
   the resources that have been reserved for them, and hence provide the
   DetNet application with the required service.  A requirement for the
   DetNet Controller Plane will be the ability to assign a particular
   identified DetNet IP flow to a path through the DetNet domain that
   has been assigned the required nodal resources.  This provides the
   appropriate traffic treatment for the flow and also includes
   particular links as a part of the path that are able to support the
   DetNet flow.  For example, by using IEEE 802.1 TSN links (as
   discussed in [I-D.mpls-over-tsn] ) DetNet parameters can be
   maintained.  Further considerations and requirements for the DetNet
   Controller Plane are discussed in Section 4.1.

   Whether configuring, calculating and instantiating these routes is a
   single-stage or multi-stage process, or in a centralized or
   distributed manner, is out of scope of this document.

   There are several of approaches that could be used to provide
   explicit routes and resource allocation in the DetNet forwarding sub-
   layer.  For example:

   o  The path could be explicitly set up by a controller which
      calculates the path and explicitly configures each node along that
      path with the appropriate forwarding and resource allocation
      information.

   o  The path could use a distributed control plane such as RSVP
      [RFC2205] or RSVP-TE [RFC3473] extended to support DetNet IP
      flows.

   o  The path could be implemented using IPv6-based segment routing
      when extended to support resource allocation.

   See Section 4.1 for further discussion of these alternatives.  In
   addition, [RFC2386] contains useful background information on QoS-
   based routing, and [RFC5575] discusses a specific mechanism used by
   BGP for traffic flow specification and policy-based routing.

4.2.3.  Contention Loss and Jitter Reduction

   As discussed in Section 1, this document does not specify the
   mechanisms needed to eliminate packet contention, packet loss or
   reduce jitter for DetNet flows at the DetNet forwarding sub-layer.
   The ability to manage node and link resources to be able to provide
   these functions is a necessary part of the DetNet controller plane.
   It is also necessary to be able to control the required queuing
   mechanisms used to provide these functions along a flow's path
   through the network.  See [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip] --> and Section 4.1
   for further discussion of these requirements.

4.2.4.  Bidirectional Traffic

   DetNet applications typically generate bidirectional traffic.  IP and
   MPLS typically treat each direction separately and do not force
   interdependence of each direction.  MPLS has considered bidirectional
   traffic requirements and the MPLS definitions from [RFC5654] are
   useful to illustrate terms such as associated bidirectional flows and
   co-routed bidirectional flows.  MPLS defines a point-to-point
   associated bidirectional LSP as consisting of two unidirectional
   point-to-point LSPs, one from A to B and the other from B to A, which
   are regarded as providing a single logical bidirectional forwarding
   path.  This is analogous to standard IP routing.  MPLS defines a
   point-to-point co-routed bidirectional LSP as an associated
   bidirectional LSP which satisfies the additional constraint that its
   two unidirectional component LSPs follow the same path (in terms of
   both nodes and links) in both directions.  An important property of
   co-routed bidirectional LSPs is that their unidirectional component
   LSPs share fate.  In both types of bidirectional LSPs, resource
   reservations may differ in each direction.  The concepts of
   associated bidirectional flows and co-routed bidirectional flows can
   also be applied to DetNet IP flows.

   While the DetNet IP data plane must support bidirectional DetNet
   flows, there are no special bidirectional features with respect to
   the data plane other than the need for the two directions of a co-
   routed bidirectional flow to take the same path.  That is to say that
   bidirectional DetNet flows are solely represented at the management
   and control plane levels, without specific support or knowledge
   within the DetNet data plane.  Fate sharing and associated or co-
   routed bidirectional flows, can be managed at the control level.

   DetNet's use of PREOF may increase the complexity of using co-routing
   bidirectional flows, since if PREOF is used, then the replication

   functions in one direction may not match the optimal points in the
   other subsequent to the network and traffic constraints.

   Control and management mechanisms need to support bidirectional
   flows, but the specification of such mechanisms are out of scope of
   this document.  An example control plane solution for MPLS can be
   found in .  Related control plan mechanisms have been defined in
   [RFC3473] , [RFC6387] and [RFC7551].

   This is further discussed in Section 4.1.

4.3.  IP-Specific Controller Plane Considerations

   This section covers IP data plane specific control plane
   considerations.

4.3.1.  Flow Identification and Aggregation

   Section 3 discussed the use of the IP "6-tuple" for flow
   identification, and goes on to discuss how identified flows use
   specific QoS mechanisms for flow-specific traffic treatment,
   including path control and resource allocation.  [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip]
   contains detailed DetNet IP flow identification procedures.  Flow
   identification will play an important role for the DetNet controller
   plane.

   Section 3.6.2 and Section 3.6.2.1 discuss the use of flow aggregation
   in DetNet.  Flow aggregation can be accomplished using any of the
   6-tuple fields defined in [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip] , using a DSCP
   identified traffic class or other field.  It will be the
   responsibility of the DetNet controller plane to be able to properly
   provision the use of these aggregation mechanisms.  These
   requirements are included in Section 4.1.

4.4.  MPLS-Specific Controller Plane Considerations

   This section covers MPLS data plane specific control plane
   considerations.  This section needs generalizing.

4.4.1.  S-Label and F-Label Assignment and Distribution

   [Editor's note - we may need additional text on resource allocation
   in this section.]

   DetNet S-Labels [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls] for their definition) are
   similar to other MPLS service labels that denote the contents of the
   MPLS packet payload such as a layer 2 pseudowire, an IP packet that




Varga, et al.           Expires November 6, 2019               [Page 20]

Internet-Draft         DetNet Data Plane Framework              May 2019


   is routed in a VPN context with a private address, or an Ethernet
   virtual private network (EVPN) service.

   S-Labels are expected to be allocated in the same manner as any other
   service labels.  S-Labels uniquely identify a particular DetNet flow,
   and are local to the node on which the label is allocated.  In the
   DetNet service sub-layer the explicit route consists of the set of
   Relay Nodes that the DetNet flow must traverse.  They can be used to
   identify the DetNet flow that a packet belongs to as it traverses a
   particular node in a DetNet domain.  Because labels are local to each
   node rather than being a global identifier within a domain, they must
   be advertised to their upstream DetNet service-aware peer nodes
   (e.g., a DetNet MPLS End System or a DetNet Relay or Edge Node and
   interpreted in the context of their received F-Label.

   As discussed in Section 3, the forwarding sub-layer uses one or more
   F-Labels to forward DetNet packets between DetNet service-aware nodes
   along explicitly defined routes at the DetNet forwarding sub-layer,
   which in the context of this document is MPLS.  F-Labels can also
   provide context for an S-Label.  In the DetNet Forwarding (MPLS) sub-
   layer the explicit route consists of the set of DetNet nodes which
   are LSRs, links, and possibly link bundle members and queues that the
   DetNet packets of a flow must traverse between nodes in the DetNet
   service sub-layer (i.e. between a specific Edge Node and the next hop
   Relay Node, between specific Relay Nodes, and between a specific
   Relay node and the egress Edge Node.  Resource allocation
   corresponding to the set of Services supported over the forwarding
   sub-layer, which may or may not include aggregation, is required at
   this sub-layer.  Explicit routes are used to ensure that packets are
   routed through the resources that have been reserved for them, and
   hence provide the DetNet application with the required service.
   Multiple F-Labels may be pushed after an S-Label and there is no
   requirement for all F-Labels to be controlled via the same controller
   mechanisms.  For example in EVPN, some labels are distributed using
   BGP while others are distributed using LDP or RSVP.

   Whether configuring, calculating and instantiating these routes is a
   single-stage or multi-stage process, or in a centralized or
   distributed manner, is out of scope of this document.

   There are a number of approaches that could be used to provide
   explicit routes and resource allocation in the MPLS forwarding sub-
   layer:

   o  The path could be explicitly set up by a controller which
      calculates the path and explicitly configures each node along that
      path with the appropriate forwarding and resource allocation
      information.



Varga, et al.           Expires November 6, 2019               [Page 21]

Internet-Draft         DetNet Data Plane Framework              May 2019


   o  The path could be set up using RSVP-TE signaling.

   o  The path could be implemented using MPLS-based segment routing
      when extended to support resource allocation.

   Much like other MPLS labels, there are a number of alternatives
   available for DetNet S-Label and F-Label advertisement to an upstream
   peer node.  These include distributed signaling protocols such as
   RSVP-TE, centralized label distribution via a controller that manages
   both the sender and the receiver using NETCONF/YANG, BGP, PCEP, etc.,
   and hybrid combinations of the two.  The details of the controller
   plane solution required for the label distribution and the management
   of the label number space are out of scope of this document, but as
   mentioned above, there are particular DetNet considerations and
   requirements that are discussed in Section 4.1.

4.5.  Packet Replication, Elimination, and Ordering (PREOF)

   The controller plane protocol solution required for managing the
   PREOF processing is outside the scope of this document.  That said,
   it should be noted that the ability to determine, for a particular
   flow, optimal packet replication and elimination points in the DetNet
   domain requires explicit support.  There are be capabilities that can
   be used, or extended, for example GMPLS end-to-end recovery [RFC4872]
   and GMPLS segment recovery [RFC4873].

4.6.  Contention Loss and Jitter Reduction

   As discussed in Section 1, this document does not specify the
   mechanisms needed to eliminate contention loss or reduce jitter for
   DetNet flows at the DetNet forwarding sub-layer.  The ability to
   manage node and link resources to be able to provide these functions
   will be a necessary part of the DetNet controller plane.  It will
   also be necessary to be able to control the required queuing
   mechanisms used to provide these functions along a flow's path
   through the network.  See Section 4.1 for further discussion of these
   requirements.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of DetNet in general are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture] and [I-D.sdt-detnet-security].  Other
   security considerations will be added in a future version of this
   draft.
