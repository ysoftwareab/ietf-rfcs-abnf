  <h1 id="rfc.section.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> <a href="#intro" id="intro">Introduction</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">The deployment of IPv6 <a href="#RFC2460">[RFC2460]</a> is now in progress, and users with no IPv4 access are likely to appear in increasing numbers in the coming years. Any provider of content or application services over the Internet will need to arrange for IPv6 access or else risk losing large numbers of potential customers. The time for action is now, while the number of such customers is small, so that appropriate skills, software and equipment can be acquired in good time to scale up the IPv6 service as demand increases. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">It is important that the introduction of IPv6 service should not make service for IPv4 customers worse.  In some circumstances, technologies intended to assist in the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 are known to have negative effects on the user experience. A deployment strategy for IPv6 must avoid these effects as much as possible. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">The purpose of this document is to provide guidance and suggestions for Internet Content Providers (ICPs) and Application Service Providers (ASPs) who wish to offer their service to both IPv6 and IPv4 customers.  For simplicity, the term ICP is mainly used in the body of this document, but the guidance also applies to ASPs. Although specific managerial and technical approaches are described, this is not a rule book; each provider will need to make its own plan, tailored to its own services and customers. </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> <a href="#strat" id="strat">General Strategy</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">The most importance advice here is to actually have a general strategy. Adding support for a second network layer protocol is a new departure for most modern organisations, and it cannot be done casually on a day-by-day basis. Even if it is impossible to write a precisely dated plan, the intended steps in the process need to be defined well in advance. There is no single blueprint for this. The rest of this document is meant to provide a set of topics to be taken into account in defining the strategy. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.2">In determining the urgency of this strategy, it should be noted that the central IPv4 registry (IANA) ran out of spare blocks of IPv4 addresses in February 2011 and the various regional registries are expected to exhaust their reserves over the next one to two years. After this, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) will run out at dates determined by their own customer base. No precise date can be given for when IPv6-only customers will appear in commercially significant numbers, but - particularly in the case of mobile users - it may be quite soon. Complacency about this is therefore not an option for any ICP that wishes to grow its customer base over the coming years. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.3">The only rational strategy for an ICP is to provide dual stack services - both IPv4 and IPv6 on an equal basis - to cover both existing and future customers. This is the recommended strategy in <a href="#RFC6180">[RFC6180]</a> for straightforward situations. Within the dual stack model, two approaches could be adopted, sometimes referred to as "outside in" and "inside out":</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Outside in: start by providing external users with an IPv6 public access to your services, for example by running a reverse proxy that handles IPv6 customers (see <a href="#proxy">Section 7</a> for details).  Progressively enable IPv6 internally. </li>
<li>Inside out: start by enabling internal networking infrastructure, hosts, and applications to support IPv6. Progressively reveal IPv6 access to external customers. </li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.5">Which of these approaches to adopt depends on the precise circumstances of the ICP concerned.  "Outside in" has the benefit of giving interested customers IPv6 access at an early stage, and thereby gaining precious operational experience, before meticulously updating every piece of equipment and software. For example, if some back-office system, that is never exposed to users, only supports IPv4, it will not cause delay. "Inside out" has the benefit of completing the implementation of IPv6 as a single project. Any ICP could choose this approach, but it might be most appropriate for a small ICP without complex back-end systems. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.6">A point that must be considered in the strategy is that some customers will remain IPv4-only for many years, others will have both IPv4 and IPv6 access, and yet others will have only IPv6. Additionally, mobile customers may find themselves switching between IPv4 and IPv6 access as they travel, even within a single session. Services and applications must be able to deal with this, just as easily as they deal today with a user whose IPv4 address changes (see the discussion of cookies in <a href="#appl">Section 8.2</a>). </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.7">An important first step in every strategy is to determine from every hardware and software supplier details of their planned dates for providing full IPv6 support in their products and services. </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.3">3.</a> <a href="#edu" id="edu">Education and Skills</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">Some older staff may have experience of running multiprotocol networks, which were common twenty years ago before the dominance of IPv4. However, IPv6 will be new to them, and also to younger staff brought up on TCP/IP. It is not enough to have one "IPv6 expert" in a team.  On the contrary, everybody who knows about IPv4 needs to know about IPv6, from network architect to help desk responder. Therefore, an early and essential part of the strategy must be education, including practical training, so that all staff acquire a general understanding of IPv6, how it affects basic features such as the DNS, and the relevant practical skills.  To take a trivial example, any staff used to dotted-decimal IPv4 addresses need to become familiar with the colon-hexadecimal format used for IPv6. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.2">There is an anecdote of one IPv6 deployment in which prefixes including the letters A to F were avoided by design, to avoid confusing sysadmins unfamiliar with hexadecimal notation.  This is not a desirable result. There is another anecdote of a help desk responder telling a customer to "disable one-Pv6" in order to solve a problem. It should be a goal to avoid having untrained staff who don't understand hexadecimal or who can't even spell "IPv6". </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.3">It is very useful to have a small laboratory network available for training and self-training in IPv6, where staff may experiment and make mistakes without disturbing the operational IPv4 service. This lab should run both IPv4 and IPv6, to gain experience with a dual-stack environment and new features such as having multiple addresses per interface. </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.4">4.</a> <a href="#isp" id="isp">Arranging IPv6 Connectivity</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">There are, in theory, two ways to obtain IPv6 connectivity to the Internet. </p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Native. In this case the ISP simply provides IPv6 on exactly the same basis as IPv4 - it will appear at the ICP's border router(s), which must then be configured in dual-stack mode to forward IPv6 packets in both directions.  This is by far the better method. An ICP should contact all its ISPs to verify when they will provide native IPv6 support, whether this has any financial implications, and whether the same service level agreement will apply as for IPv4. Any ISP that has no definite plan to offer native IPv6 service should be avoided. </li>
<li>Tunnel. It is possible to configure an IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnel to a remote ISP that offers such a service. A dual-stack router in the ICP's network will act as a tunnel end-point, or this function could be included in the ICP's border router.  <br><br> A tunnel is a reasonable way to obtain IPv6 connectivity for initial testing and skills acquisition. However, it introduces an inevitable extra latency compared to native IPv6, giving users a noticeably worse response time for complex web pages.  It is also likely to limit the IPv6 MTU size. In normal circumstances, native IPv6 will provide an MTU size of at least 1500 bytes, but it will almost inevitably be less for a tunnel, possibly as low as 1280 bytes (the minimum MTU allowed for IPv6).  Apart from the resulting loss of efficiency, there are cases in which Path MTU Discovery fails, therefore IPv6 fragmentation fails, and in this case the lower tunnel MTU will actually cause connectivity failures for customers.  <br><br> For these reasons, ICPs are strongly recommended to obtain native IPv6 service before attempting to offer a production-quality service to their users. </li>

<a href="#rfc.section.5.1">5.1.</a> Address and subnet assignment</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.1">An ICP must first decide whether to apply for its own Provider Independent (PI) address prefix for IPv6. The default is to obtain a Provider Aggregated (PA) prefix from each of its ISPs, and operate them in parallel. Both solutions are viable in IPv6. However, the wide area routing system (BGP4) can only support a limited number of routes for PI prefixes, so only the largest providers can justify the bother and expense of obtaining a PI prefix and convincig their ISPs to route it.  Millions of enterprise networks will use PA prefixes. In this case, a change of ISP would necessitate a change of the corresponding PA prefix, using the procedure outlined in <a href="#RFC4192">[RFC4192]</a>.  <br><br> An ICP that has multiple connections via multiple ISPs will have multiple PA prefixes. This commonly results in multiple PA-based addresses for the servers.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.2">An ICP may also choose to operate a Unique Local Address prefix <a href="#RFC4193">[RFC4193]</a> for internal traffic only, as described in <a href="#RFC4864">[RFC4864]</a>. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.3">Depending on its projected future size, an ICP might choose to obtain /48 PI or PA prefixes (allowing 16 bits of subnet address) or longer PA prefixes, e.g. /56 (allowing 8 bits of subnet address).  Clearly the choice of /48 is more future-proof. Advice on the numbering of subnets may be found in <a href="#RFC5375">[RFC5375]</a>. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.4">Since IPv6 provides for operating multiple prefixes simultaneously, it is important to check that all relevant tools, such as address management packages, can deal with this. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.5">Theoretically, it would be possible to operate an ICP's IPv6 network using only Stateless Address Autoconfiguration <a href="#RFC4862">[RFC4862]</a>. In practice, an ICP of reasonable size will probably choose to operate DHCPv6 <a href="#RFC3315">[RFC3315]</a> and use it to support stateful and/or on-demand address assignment. </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.5.2">5.2.</a> Routing</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.1">In a dual stack network, IPv4 and IPv6 routing protocols operate quite independently and in parallel.  The common routing protocols all exist in IPv6 versions, such as OSPFv3 <a href="#RFC5340">[RFC5340]</a>.  For trained staff, there should be no particular difficulty in deploying IPv6 routing without disturbance to IPv4 services. </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.5.3">5.3.</a> DNS</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.1">This is largely a case of "just do it." Each externally visible host (or virtual host) that has an A record for its IPv4 address needs an AAAA record <a href="#RFC3596">[RFC3596]</a> for its IPv6 address, and a reverse entry if applicable. One important detail is that some clients (especially Windows XP) can only reslove DNS names via IPv4, even if they can use IPv6 for application traffic. It is therefore advisable for all DNS servers to respond to queries via both IPv4 and IPv6. </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.6">
<a href="#rfc.section.6">6.</a> <a href="#load" id="load">Load Balancers</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.1">It is to be expected that IPv6 traffic will initially be low, i.e. a small percentage of IPv4 traffic. For this reason, updating load balancers to fully support IPv6 can perhaps be delayed; however, such an update needs to be planned in anticipation of significant growth over a period of several years. The same would apply to TLS or HTTP proxies used for load balancing purposes. </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7">
<a href="#rfc.section.7">7.</a> <a href="#proxy" id="proxy">Proxies</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.1">An HTTP proxy <a href="#RFC2616">[RFC2616]</a> can readily be configured to handle incoming connections over IPv6 and to proxy them to a server over IPv4. Therefore, a single proxy can be used as the first step in an outside-in strategy, as shown in the following diagram: </p>

<p id="rfc.section.7.p.2">In this case, the AAAA record for the service would provide the IPv6 address of the proxy.  This approach will work for any HTTP or HTTPS applications that operate successfully via a proxy, as long as IPv6 load remains low. </p>

</h1>
<h1 id="rfc.section.8.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.8.1">8.1.</a> Network Stack</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.1">The TCP/IP network stacks in popular operating systems have supported IPv6 for many years. In most cases, it is sufficient to enable IPv6 and possibly DHCPv6; the rest will follow. Servers inside an ICP network will not need to support any transition technologies beyond a simple dual stack, with a possible exception for 6to4 mitigation noted below in <a href="#xition">Section 9</a>. </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.8.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.8.2">8.2.</a> <a href="#appl" id="appl">Application Layer</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.2.p.1">Basic HTTP servers have been able to handle an IPv6-enabled network stack for some years, so at the most it will be necessary to update to a more recent software version. The same is true of generic applications such as email protocols. No general statement can be made about other applications, especially proprietary ones, so each ASP will need to make its own determination. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.2.p.2">One important recommendation here is that all applications should use domain names, which are IP-version-independent, rather than IP addresses. Applications based on middlware platforms which have uniform support for IPv4 and IPv6, for example Java, may be able to support both IPv4 and IPv6 naturally without additional work. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.2.p.3">A specific issue for HTTP-based services is that IP address-based cookie authentication schemes will need to deal with dual-stack clients. Servers might create a cookie for an IPv4 connection or an IPv6 connection, depending on the setup at the client site and on the whims of the client operating system. There is no guarentee that a given client will consistently use the same address family, especially when accessing a collection of sites rather than a single site. If the client is using privacy addresses <a href="#RFC4941">[RFC4941]</a>, the IPv6 address (but not its /64 prefix) might change quite frequently. Any cookie mechanism based on 32-bit IPv4 addresses will need significant remodelling. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.2.p.4">Generic considerations on application transition are discussed in <a href="#RFC4038">[RFC4038]</a>, but many of them will not apply to the dual-stack ICP scenario. An ICP that creates and maintains its own applications will need to review them for any dependency on IPv4. </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.8.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.8.3">8.3.</a> Geolocation</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.3.p.1">As time goes on, it is to be assumed that geolocation methods and databases will be updated to fully support IPv6 prefixes. There is no reason they will be more or less accurate in the long term than those available for IPv4. However, we can expect many more clients to be mobile as time goes on, so geolocation based on IP addresses alone may become problematic. Initially, at least, ICPs may observe some weakness in geolocation for IPv6 clients. </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.9">
<a href="#rfc.section.9">9.</a> <a href="#xition" id="xition">Coping with Transition Technologies</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.1">As mentioned above, an ICP should obtain native IPv6 connectivity from its ISPs. In this way, the ICP can avoid most of the complexities of the numerous IPv4-to-IPv6 transition technologies that have been developed; they are all second-best solutions.  However, some clients are sure to be using such technologies. An ICP needs to be aware of the operational issues this may cause and how to deal with them. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.2">In some cases, clients may reach an ICP service via a network-layer translator between IPv4 and IPv6. ICPs who are offering a dual stack service, as recommended in this document, should not normally see traffic from NAT64 translators <a href="#RFC6146">[RFC6146]</a>. Exceptionally, such traffic could arrive via IPv4 from an IPv6-only client whose DNS resolver failed to receive the ICP's AAAA record, but this would be indistinguishable from a regular IPv4-via-NAT customer. Similarly, ICPs who are offering a dual stack service might exceptionally see IPv6 traffic translated from an IPv4-only client that somehow failed to receive the ICP's A record. This would only be an issue if the ICP was offering any service that depends on the assumption of end-to-end IPv6 address transparency. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.3">In other cases, clients may reach the IPv6 network via some form of IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnel.  In this case a variety of problems can arise, the most acute of which affect clients connected using the Anycast 6to4 solution <a href="#RFC3068">[RFC3068]</a>. Advice on how ICPs may mitigate these 6to4 problems is given in Section 4.5. of <a href="#RFC6343">[RFC6343]</a>.  For the benefit of all tunnelled clients, it is essential to verify that Path MTU Discovery works correctly (i.e., the relevant ICMPv6 packets are not blocked) and that the server-side TCP implementation correctly supports the Maximum Segment Size (MSS) negotiation mechanism <a href="#RFC2923">[RFC2923]</a> for IPv6 traffic. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.4">Some ICPs have implemented an interim solution to mitigate transition problems by limiting the visibility of their AAAA records to users with validated IPv6 connectivity <a href="#I-D.ietf-v6ops-v6-aaaa-whitelisting-implications">[I-D.ietf-v6ops-v6-aaaa-whitelisting-implications]</a>. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.5">Another approach taken by some ICPs is to offer IPv6-only support via a specific DNS name, e.g., ipv6.example.com, if the primary service is www.example.com. In this case ipv6.example.com would have an AAAA record only. This has some value for testing purposes, but is otherwise only of interest to hobbyist users willing to type in special URLs. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.6">There is little an ICP can do to deal with client-side or remote ISP deficiencies in IPv6 support, but it is hoped that the "happy eyeballs" <a href="#I-D.ietf-v6ops-happy-eyeballs">[I-D.ietf-v6ops-happy-eyeballs]</a> approach will improve the ability for clients to deal with such problems. </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.10">
<a href="#rfc.section.10">10.</a> <a href="#cdn" id="cdn">Content Delivery Networks</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.1">DNS-based techniques for diverting users to Content Delivery Network (CDN) points of presence (POPs) will work for IPv6, if AAAA records are provided as well as A records. In general the CDN should follow the recommendations of this document, especially by operating a full dual stack service at each POP. Additionally, each POP will need to handle IPv6 routing exactly like IPv4, for example running BGP4+ <a href="#RFC4760">[RFC4760]</a> if appropriate. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.2">Note that if an ICP supports IPv6 but its CDN does not, its clients will continue to use IPv4 and any IPv6-only clients will have to use a transition solution of some kind. This is not a desirable situation, since the ICP's work to support IPv6 will be wasted. The converse is not true: if the CDN supports IPv6 but the ICP does not, dual-stack and IPv6-only clients will obtain IPv6 access. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.3">An ICP might face a complex situation, if its CDN provider supports IPv6 at some POPs but not at others. IPv6-only clients could only be diverted to a POP supporting IPv6. There are also scenarios where a dual-stack client would be diverted to a mixture of IPv4 and IPv6 POPs for different URLs, according to the A and AAAA records provided and the availability of optimisations such as "happy eyeballs." These complications do not affect the viability of relying on a dual-stack CDN, however. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.4">The CDN itself faces related complexity: "As IPv6 rolls out, it's going to roll out in pockets, and that's going to make the routing around congestion points that much more important but also that much harder," stated John Summers of Akamai in 2010.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.11">
<a href="#rfc.section.11">11.</a> <a href="#oam" id="oam">Operations and Management</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.1">Whatever management, monitoring and logging is performed for IPv4 is also needed for IPv6. Therefore, all products and tools used for these purposes must be updated to fully support IPv6. Note that since an IPv6 network may operate with more than one IPv6 prefix and therefore more than one address per host, the tools must deal with this as a normal situation. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.2">As far as possible, however, mutual dependency between IPv4 and IPv6 operations should be avoided.  A failure of one should not cause a failure of the other. One precaution to avoid this is that back-end systems such as network management databases should themselves be dual stacked.  It should be possible to use IPv4 connectivity to repair IPv6 configurations, and vice versa. </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.12">
<a href="#rfc.section.12">12.</a> <a href="#security" id="security">Security Considerations</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.12.p.1">Essentially every threat that exists for IPv4 exists or will exist for IPv6. Therefore, it is essential to update firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and security auditing technology to fully support IPv6. Otherwise, IPv6 will become an attractive target for attackers. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.12.p.2">In a dual stack operation, there may be a risk of cross-contamination between the two protocols. For example, a successful IPv4-based denial of service attack might also deplete resources needed by the IPv6 service, or vice versa. This risk strengthens the argument that IPv6 security must be up to the same level as IPv4. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.12.p.3">A general overview of techniques to protect an IPv6 network against external attack is given in <a href="#RFC4864">[RFC4864]</a>. Assuming an ICP has native IPv6 connectivity, it is advisable to block incoming IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel traffic using IPv4 protocol type 41. Outgoing traffic of this kind should be blocked except for the case noted in Section 4.5 of <a href="#RFC6343">[RFC6343]</a>. ICMPv6 traffic should only be blocked in accordance with <a href="#RFC4890">[RFC4890]</a>; in particular, Packet Too Big messages, which are essential for PMTU discovery, must not be blocked. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.12.p.4">Scanning attacks to discover the existence of hosts are much less likely to succeed for IPv6 than for IPv4 <a href="#RFC5157">[RFC5157]</a>. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.12.p.5">Transport Layer Security version 1.2 <a href="#RFC5246">[RFC5246]</a> and its predecessors work correctly with TCP over IPv6, meaning that HTTPS-based security solutions are immediately applicable. The same should apply to any other transport-layer or application-layer security techniques. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.12.p.6">If an ICP or ASP uses IPsec <a href="#RFC4301">[RFC4301]</a> and IKE <a href="#RFC5996">[RFC5996]</a> in any way to secure connections with clients, these too are fully applicable to IPv6, but only if the software stack at each end has been appropriately updated. </p>
