1.  Introduction

   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) toolset provides
   methods for fault management and performance monitoring in each layer
   of the network, in order to improve their ability to support services
   with guaranteed and strict Service Level Agreements (SLAs) while
   reducing operational costs.

   The interpretation of the fields is as following:

      The Version reflects the current version.  The version number is
      to be incremented whenever a change is made that affects the
      ability of an implementation to correctly parse or process control
      packet.

      The Global Flags is a bit vector field

      The Message Type filed reflects the type of the packet.  Value
      TBA2 identifies Echo Request and TBA3 - Echo Reply

      The Reply Mode defines the type of the return path requested by
      the sender of the Echo Request.

      Return Codes and Subcodes can be used to inform the sender about
      result of processing its request.

      The Sender's Handle is filled in by the sender, and returned
      unchanged by the receiver in the Echo Reply.

      The Sequence Number is assigned by the sender and can be (for
      example) used to detect missed replies.

      TLVs (Type-Length-Value tuples) have the two octets long Type
      field, two octets long Length field that is length of the Value
      field in octets.

2.1.  Overlay Echo Request Transmission

   Overlay Echo Request control packet MUST use the appropriate
   encapsulation of the monitored overlay network.  Overlay network
   encpsulation MUST identify Echo Request as OAM packet.  Overlay
   encapsulation uses different methods to identify OAM payload
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe], [I-D.ietf-nvo3-gue],
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve],
   [I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh],[I-D.ietf-bier-mpls-encapsulation].  Overlay
   network's header MUST be immediately followed by the Overlay OAM
   Header [I-D.ooamdt-rtgwg-ooam-header].  Message Type field in the
   Overlay OAM Header MUST be set to Overlay Echo Request value (TBA2).

   Value of the Reply Mode field MAY be set to:

   o  Do Not Reply (TBA4) if one-way monitoring is desired.  If Echo
      Request is used to measure synthetic packet loss, the receiver MAY
      report loss measurement results to a remote node.

   o  Reply via an IPv4/IPv6 UDP Packet (TBA5) value likely will be the
      most used.

   o  Reply via Application Level Control Channel (TBA6) value if the
      overlay network MAY have bi-directional paths.

   o  Reply via Specified Path (TBA7) value in order to enforce use of
      the particular return path specified in the included TLV to verify
      bi-directional continuity and also increase robustness of the
      monitoring by selecting more stable path.

2.2.  Overlay Echo Request Reception

2.3.  Overlay Echo Reply Transmission

   The Reply Mode field directs whether and how the Echo Reply message
   should be sent.  The sender of the Echo Request MAY use TLVs to
   request that corresponding Echo Reply be sent using the specified
   path.  Value TBA3 is referred as "Do not reply" mode and suppresses
   transmission of Echo Reply packet.  Default value (TBA5) for the
   Reply mode field requests the responder to send the Echo Reply packet
   out-of-band as IPv4 or IPv6 UDP packet.  [Selection of destination
   and source IP addresses and UDP port numbers to be provided in the
   next update.]

4.  Security Considerations

   Overlay EchoRequest/Replay operates withing the domain of the overlay
   network and thus inherits any security considerations that apply to
   the use of that overlay technology and, consequently, underlay data
   plane.  Also, the security needs for Overlay Echo Request/Reply are
   similar to those of ICMP ping [RFC0792], [RFC4443] and MPLS LSP ping
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-rfc4379bis].

   There are at least three approaches of attacking a node in the
   overlay network using the mechanisms defined in the document.  One is
   a Denial-of-Service attack, by sending Overlay ping to overload a
   node in the overlay network.  The second may use spoofing, hijacking,
   replaying, or otherwise tampering with Overlay Echo Requests and/or
   Replies to misrepresent, alter operator's view of the state of the
   overlay network.  The third is an unauthorized source using an
   Overlay Echo Request/Reply to obtain information about the overlay
   and/or underlay network.

Internet-Draft    On-demand CC/CV for Overlay Networks      October 2016


   To mitigate potential Denial-of-Service attacks, it is RECOMMENDED
   that implementations throttle the Overlay ping traffic going to the
   control plane.

   Replay and spoofing attacks involving faking or replaying Overlay
   Echo Reply messages would have to match the Sender's Handle and
   Sequence Number of an outstanding Overlay Echo Request message which
   is highl unlikely.  Thus the non-matching replay would be discarded.
   But since "even a broken clock is right twice a day" implementions
   MAY use Timestamp control block [I-D.ooamdt-rtgwg-ooam-header] to
   validate the TimeStamp Sent by requiring an exact match on this
   field.

   To protect against unauthorized sources trying to obtain information
   about the overlay and/or underlay an implementation MAY check that
   the source of the Echo Request is indeed part of the overlay domain.
