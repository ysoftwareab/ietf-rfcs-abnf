                                 ABSTRACT


         This note describes two RTP payload formats for in-band telephony 
signal events (TSE) such as DTMF, dial-tone, ring-tone, off-hook, SIT, etc. 
One payload is designed to carry a named signal, and the other is designed 
carry a compact representation of actual audio waveform cadence to be played.
The two formats are independent, but they can be used together very usefully
within redundant audio payloads; this enables highly efficient and robust 
transport of telephony network signal events along with a representation of 
the actual audio media associated to the signal events.


Acknowledgements: This internet draft is an extension of H. Schulzrinne's
draft ietf-avt-dtmf-00.txt and borrows heavily from it (including copying 
actual text). The main extensions appearing in this draft are as follows:

a) many other telephony call progress tones and signal events have been 
added to the original DTMF and flash-hook of ietf-avt-dtmf-00.txt (an 
attempt has been made to align this with [MGCP] and [E.180 supp2]
b) a second payload is defined which carries a highly compact 
frequency representation of the audio waveform of the signal;
c) a few clarifications about reliability and redundancy, including how 
the two payloads will work together.

Acknowledgement is also due to [MGCP]; part of this draft is an attempt 
to use RTP to provide the signal transport required by MGCP, in a way 
which can be reused by a large class of applications.

Internet Draft                  TSE Payload                17 Nov, 1998

1 Introduction

   This memo defines two payload formats for carrying in-band telephony 
   signal events (TSE) within RTP packets. These are events such as 
   DTMF tones, MF tones, on-hook, off-hook, flash-hook events, ring 
   tones and ring-back tones, continuity tones, busy tones, call waiting 
   tones, etc. A complete list is given in section 2. It is desirable to 
   transport these signals with a separate payload type for several reasons:

a) low-rate voice codecs cannot be guaranteed to accurately reproduce the 
audio waveforms, while special tone generators can be driven by a special 
payload type;
b) defining a separate payload type permits higher redundancy than for 
other payload types in the audio stream;
c) It removes the need for complicated tone detection algorithms in 
equipment that receives the new payload type;
d) it enables the separation of the detection of the signal tones in media 
gateways from the semantic interpretation of the tones in signalling 
gateways and "call agents" (see [MGCP]).

   The payload type must be suitable for both gateway and end-
   to-end scenarios. In gateway scenarios, a gateway connecting a
   packet voice network with the PSTN recreates the signal events 
   and then injects them into the PSTN, or detects the signal events and
   then re-encodes them with the new payload format. Since the detection 
   may take several tens of milliseconds, careful time and power (volume)
   alignment is needed to avoid generating spurious events for some 
   applications. For other applications, such as MGCP Call Agents [MGCP]
   or interactive voice response (IVR) systems directly connected to the
   packet voice network, time alignment and volume levels are not
   important, since the unit will not perform any signal analysis to
   detect the signal events from the audio stream.


   When these telephony signal events are carried in-band as part of the 
   audio stream, such as is the case with DTMF digits,  etc.
   senders SHOULD use the same sequence number and time-stamp base as the 
   regular audio channel to simplify recreation of analog audio at a gateway.

   The default clock frequency is 8000 Hz, but the clock frequency can
   be redefined when assigning the dynamic payload type.

   This format achieves a higher than the method proposed for the Voice over
   Frame Relay Implementation Agreement [1], even in the case of
   sustained packet loss.


   Note that these telephony signal events are often sent as audio 
   waveforms within the ordinary audio stream. In these cases,  
   a source MAY send a TSE payload and coded audio packets for the same

   time instants, using TSE as the redundant encoding for the audio
   stream, or it MAY block outgoing audio while the TSE tones are active
   and only send TSE as both the primary and redundant encodings. 
   For signal events which are not normally sent as audio waveforms (such
   as on-hook, flash-hook, etc.), the regular audio SHOULD be blocked for
   the duration of the TSE. 

   In this note we define two independent payload formats: 

a) a payload for named signal events (NSE). This payload is useful when 
there is no need to send any encoding of the audio waveforms that are used
within the telephone network to represent the signal events, or when no 
such audio waveforms exist.

b) a payload for signal tone frequencies (STF). This payload is useful 
when it is desired to transmit the actual audio media associated to the 
telephone signal event. 

Each of these payloads can be viewed as a special type of audio compression.
Just as there are codecs which are highly optimised (say) for human speech,
these payloads are highly optimised for the special audio which signals 
certain events within telephone networks. 

When the transmitter and receiver both agree (via non RTP means) on the audio 
interpretation of the TSE, the transmitter SHOULD use the named signal events
payload. For example, this is usually the case for two PSTN gateways within
a single country: "dial tone" is the same in all parts of the United States.
When the RTP transmitter needs finer control over the actual audio media to 
be played at the receiver, it SHOULD use the signal tone frequencies payload. 
For example, since ringback is different in Mexico than in the United States, 
a Mexican gateway which used the named signal events payload to transmit 
ringback from Mexico to the United States might result in an incorrect audio
signal ("USA ringback") being generated at the handset of the caller. The RTP
transmitter MAY use the named signal events payload as a primary payload 
type and the tone frequencies payload as a secondary payload type within a 
redundant audio payload type (see section 4). This will allow the transmitter
to send the semantic information present in the named signal ("ringback")
along with the representation of the audio.

Some of the named signal events are very long (on the order of several seconds).
If a gateway waits to detect the named signal event before transmitting it 
within an NSE packet, a substantial delay might result. A gateway MAY to 
transmit the audio within an ordinary encoded audio payload, or within
a signal tone frequency payload. The NSE payload can then be used as a 
redundant audio type as soon as detection is accomplished.

   volume: The power level of the digit, expressed in dBm0 after
        dropping the sign, with range from 0 to -63 dBm0. The range of
        valid DTMF is from 0 to -36 dBm0 (must accept); lower than -55
        dBm0 must be rejected (TR-TSY-000181, ITU-T Q.24A). Thus, larger
        values denote lower volume.

   Note: since the acceptable dip is 10 dB and the minimum detectable
   loudness variation is 3 dB, this field could be compressed by at
   least a bit by reducing resolution to 2 dB, if needed.

   duration: Duration of this digit, in timestamp units. (For a sampling
        rate of 8000 Hz, this field is sufficient to express digit
        durations of upto approximately 8 seconds; the minimum
        permissible digit length is 40 ms.)

   R: This field is reserved for future use. The sender MUST set it to
        zero, the receiver MUST ignore it.

 

event: The event name identifies the actual telephone signal event. The 
events are encoded as follows (these events are extracted from [E.180Supp2] 
and [MGCP]):

Answer Supervision:

Reorder Tone:
     (120 Impulses per minute tone).


Calling Card Service Tone:
     60 ms of 941 + 1477 Hz and 940 ms of 350 + 440 Hz (dial tone),
     decaying exponentially with a time constant of 200 ms.


   If a gateway is detecting signal events for re-encoding within this NSE
   Payload format, it SHOULD start transmitting event packets as soon
   as it recognizes the event and every multiple of a frame
   period or, for sample-based codecs, every 50 ms thereafter. If an
   event continues for more than one period, it should send a new NSE
   packet with the RTP timestamp value corresponding to the beginning of
   the event and the duration of the digit increased correspondingly.
   (The RTP sequence number is incremented by one for each packet.) 
   Note that the RTP timestamp value corresponding to the beginning of the 
   digit ( perhaps combined with the SSRC) can be used to avoid a mistaken
   interpretation of two separate tones and the creation of spurious tones 
   at the receiver, in the case of packet loss.


        Events are sent incrementally to avoid having the
        receiver wait for the completion of the event. Since some
        tones are very long, this would incur a substantial
        delay.

3 Signal Tone Frequency Format


    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   modulation  |R R|  volume   |          duration             |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |  mul  |          freq1        |R R R R|         freq2         |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   

volume and duration are as in the signal tone frequency format. 
freq1 and freq2 are values from 0Hz to 4096Hz. 
Modulation is a value from 0Hz to 255Hz.
mul is a value from 0 to 15

Freq1 must be present; the presence of freq2 is optional.
(Is there some reason to prefer a fixed-length payload??)

The tone to be played is a sum of the frequencies freq1 and freq2, modulated
By Func(modulation, mul), where Func is defined as follows:


Petrack                                                       [Page 8]







Internet Draft                  TSE Payload                17 Nov, 1998

Func (x, y) =  x * y / 3

([E.180 supp. 2] defines modulation frequencies which go from 16Hz to 450Hz, 
including a few fractional values such as 16 1/3 and 20 2/3).

Standard tone cadences can be built up using this RTP payload very easily. 
Receivers which receive a consecutive sequence of STF packets MUST play 
them out with a smoothly interpolated phase.

(Is there a need to include a bit for phase reversal??).


As a simple example, ringing tone in the United States is a tone of 420Hz
modulated by a sine wave of 25Hz, playing for 2 seconds, followed by silence
for 4 seconds, and then recycling. In France, ringing tone is an unmodulated
440Hz tone, playing for 1.5 seconds, followed by a silence for 3.5 seconds,
then recycling. When a call is placed from a phone in the USA to a phone in
France, the TSF format SHOULD be transmitted by the French 
PSTN gateway back to an American gateway, in order to ensure that French
ringback tone is heard. (If some non RTP signalling had been used to convey
the information to the American gateway that the remote end is in France, 
and the American gateway knew French tone cadences, it would be possible 
to transmit the telephone signal events via the simpler TSE payload format).


4 Reliability

   To achieve reliability even when the network loses packets, the audio
   redundancy mechanism described in [RFC 2198] is used. The effective data
   rate is !r! times 64 bits (32 bits for the redundancy header and 32
   bits for the DTMF payload) every 50 ms or !r! times 1280 bits/second,
   where !r! is the number of redundant events carried in each
   packet. The value of !r! is an implementation trade-off, with a value
   of 5 suggested.

   Each TSE event SHOULD be retransmitted at least three times to ensure 
   some measure of reliability.

        The timestamp offset in RFC2198 has 14 bits,
        so that it allows a single packet to "cover" 2.048 seconds
        of events at a sampling rate of 8000 Hz. Including the
        starting time of previous events allows precise
        reconstruction of the tone sequence at a gateway. The
        scheme is resilient to consecutive packet losses spanning
        this interval of 2.048 seconds or !r! events, whichever is
        less. Note that for previous events, only an average
        loudness can be represented.

   An encoder MAY treat either TSE payload as a highly-compressed version
   of the current audio frame. In that mode, each RTP packet during a
   TSE tone would contain the current audio codec rendition (say,
   G.723.1 or G.729) of this event as well as the representation
   described in Section 2, plus any previous digits as before.

Petrack                                                       [Page 9]





Internet Draft                  TSE Payload                17 Nov, 1998



        This approach allows dumb gateways that do not understand
        this format to function. It also allows the actual audio 
        waveform to be sent with no extra delay, and then to be
        covered by the TSE format when the transmitter detects the
        signal event.

It is possible to mix these two audio telephony payload formats, in 
order to adapt to network conditions and the shared knowledge of the
participants in the RTP session.


3.1 Example

3.1.1 NSE format

   A typical RTP packet, where the user is just dialing the last digit
   of the DTMF sequence "911". The first digit was 200 ms long and
   started at time 0, the second digit lasted 250 ms and started at time
   800 ms, the third digit has just been pressed for 100 ms, at time 1.5
   s. The frame duration is 50 ms. To make the parts recognizable, the
   figure below ignores byte alignment. Timestamp and sequence number
   are assumed to have been zero at the beginning of the first digit.

3.1.2 Mixed NSE and STF format

   Here is a typical packet which might be sent from a French PSTN 
gateway back to a PSTN gateway in the USA, during the transmission of
ringback tone (event number 106). This packet would be sent back 1.5 
seconds into the transmission of the ringback tone. At this point, the 
receiver should have heard 1.5 seconds of 440Hz tone:
