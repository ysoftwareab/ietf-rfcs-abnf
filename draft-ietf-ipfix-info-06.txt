1.  Introduction

   The IP Flow Information eXport (IPFIX) protocol serves for
   transmitting information related to measured IP traffic over the
   Internet.  The protocol specification in [IPFIX-PROTO] defines how
   information elements are transmitted.  For information elements, it
   specifies the encoding of a set of basic data types.  However, the
   list of fields that can be transmitted by the protocol, such as flow
   attributes (source IP address, number of packets, etc.) and
   information about the Metering and Exporting Process (packet
   Observation Point, smapling rate, flow timeout interval, etc.), is
   not specified in [IPFIX-PROTO].

   This document complements the IPFIX protocol specification by
   providing the IPFIX information model.  IPFIX-specific terminology
   used in this document including terms such as 'IP Traffic Flow',
   'Observation Point', 'Metering Process', 'Exporting Process', and
   'Collecting Process' is defined in [IPFIX-PROTO].

   The main part of this document is Section 5 defining the (extensible)
   list of fields to be transmitted by the IPFIX protcol.  Section 2
   defines a template for specifying IPFIX fields that is used in
   Section 4.  Section 3 defines the set of abstract data types that are
   available for IPFIX fields.  Section 5 discusses extensibility of the
   IPFIX information model.

   The main bodies of Sections 2, 3 and 4 were generated from XML
   documents.  The XML-based specification of template, abstract data
   types and IPFIX fields can be used for automatically checking
   syntactical correctness of the specification of IPFIX fields.  It can
   further be used for generating IPFIX protocol implementation code
   that deals with processing IPFIX fields.  Also code for applications
   that further process traffic information transmitted via the IPFIX
   protocol can be generated with the XML specification of IPFIX fields.

   For that reason, the XML document that served as source for Section 4
   and the XML schema that served as source for Sections 2 and 3 are
   attached to this document in Appendices A and B.

   Note that although partially generated from the attached XML
   documents, the main body of this document is normative while the
   appendices are informational.

2.  Properties of IPFIX Protocol Information Elements

   Fields in messages of the IPFIX protocol carrying information about
   traffic measurement are modeled as elements of the IPFIX information
   model and specified in Section 4.  For defining these information
   elements, a template is used that is specified below.

   All information elements specified for the IPFIX protocol either in
   this document or by any future extension MUST have the following
   properties defined:
   name - A unique and meaningful name for the information element.  The
      preferred spelling for the name is to use mixed case if the name
      is compound, with an initial lower case letter, e.g.,
      "sourceIpAddress".
   fieldId - A numeric identifier administered by IANA.  This is used
      for compact identification of an information item when encoding
      templates in the protocol.
   description - The semantics of this information element.  Describes
      how this field is derived from the flow or other information
      available to the observer.
   dataType - One of the types listed in section 3.1 of this document or
      in an extension of the information model.  The type space for
      attributes is constrained to facilitate implementation.  The
      existing type space does however encompass most basic types used
      in modern programming languages, as well as some derived types
      (such as IPAddress) which are common to this domain and useful to
      distinguish.
   applicability - This propoerty of an information element indicates in
      which kind of records the element can be used.  Allowed values for
      this property are 'data', 'option', and 'all'.
   status - The status of the specification of this information element.
      Allowed values are 'current', 'deprecated', and 'obsolete'.

   All information elements specified for the IPFIX protocol either in
   this document or by any future extension MAY have the following
   properties defined:
   enterpriseId - When extension is done outside of the scope of the
      IANA IPFIX fieldId range, a enterpriseId MUST be provided.  Valid
      values for the enterpriseId are defined by IANA as SMI network
      management private enterprise code.  They are defined at
      http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers.
   dataTypeSemantics - The integral types may be qualified by additional
      semantic details.  Valid values for the data type semantics are
      specified in section 3.2 of this document or in an extension of
      the information model.

Internet-Draft          IPFIX Information Model            February 2005


   units - If the field is a measure of some kind, the units identify
      what the measure is.
   enumeratedRange - Some items may have a specific set of numeric
      identifiers associated with a set of discrete values this element
      may take.  The meaning of each discrete value and a human readable
      name should be assigned.
   range - Some elements may only be able to take on a restricted set of
      values which can be expressed as a range (e.g.  0 through 511
      inclusive).  If this is the case, the valid inclusive range should
      be specified.
   reference - Identifies additional specifications which more precisely
      define this item or provide additional context for its use.

3.  Type Space

   This section describes the abstract data types that can be used for
   the specification of IPFIX fields in Section 4.  Section 3.1
   describes the set of data types.  For the integral data types octet,
   unsigned16, unsigned32, and unsigned64 also data type semantics can
   be specified, such as, for example, 'counter', 'identifier' or
   'flags'.  Data type semantics are specified in section 3.2.

3.1  Data Types

   This section describes the set of valid data types of the IPFIX
   information model.  Note that further data types may be specified by
   protocol extensions.

3.1.1  octet

   The type "octet" represents a non-negative integer value in the range
   of 0 to 255.

3.1.2  unsigned16

   The type "unsigned16" represents a non-negative integer value in the
   range of 0 to 65535.

3.1.3  unsigned32

   The type "unsigned32" represents a non-negative integer value in the
   range of 0 to 4294967295.

3.1.4  unsigned64

   The type "unsigned64" represents a non-negative integer value in the
   range of 0 to 18446744073709551615.

3.1.5  float32

   The type "float32" corresponds to an IEEE single-precision 32-bit
   floating point type.

3.1.6  boolean

   The type "boolean" represents a binary value.

3.1.7  octetArray

   The type "octetArray" represents a finite length string of octets.

3.1.8  string

   The type "string" represents a finite length string of valid
   characters from the Unicode character encoding set.  Unicode allows
   for ASCII and many other international character sets to be used.  It
   is expected that strings will be encoded in UTF-8 format, which is
   identical in encoding for USASCII characters, but also accomodates
   other Unicode multibyte characters.

3.1.9  dateTimeSeconds

   The type "dateTimeSeconds" represents a time value having a precision
   of seconds and normalized to the GMT timezone.  Such types are in
   common use on many operating systems and have the advantage that they
   can be stored in 32-bit integers.

3.1.10  dateTimeMicroSeconds

   The type "dateTimeSeconds" represents a time value having a precision
   of microseconds and normalized to the GMT timezone.

3.1.11  ipv4Address

   The type "ipv4Addr" represents a value of an IPv4 address.  These
   addresses are typically stored as 32-bit integers.

3.1.12  ipv6Address

   The type "ipv6Addr" represents a value of an IPv6 address.


3.2  Data Type Semantics

   This section describes the set of valid data type semantics of the
   IPFIX information model.  Note that further data type semantics may
   be specified by protocol extensions.

3.2.1  quantity

   A quantity value represents a discrete measured value pertaining to
   the record.  This is distinguished from counters which represent an
   ongoing measured value whose "odometer" reading is captured as part
   of a given record.  If no semantic qualifier is given, the integral
   fields should behave as a quantity.

3.2.2  totalCounter

   A measurement which is ongoing from the perspective of the Exporter.

Internet-Draft          IPFIX Information Model            February 2005


   Basically the same semantics as counters in SNMP.  Counters are
   unsigned and wrap back to zero after reaching the limit of the type.
   For example, an unsigned64 with counter semantics will continue to
   increment until reaching the value of 2**64 - 1.  At this point the
   next increment will wrap its value to zero and continue counting from
   zero.  A running counter counts independent of the export of its
   value.

3.2.3  deltaCounter

   A measurement which is ongoing from the perspective of the Exporter.
   Basically the same semantics as counters in SNMP.  Counters are
   unsigned and wrap back to zero after reaching the limit of the type.
   For example, an unsigned64 with counter semantics will continue to
   increment until reaching the value of 2**64 - 1.  At this point the
   next increment will wrap its value to zero and continue counting from
   zero.  A delta counter is reset to zero each time its value is
   exported.

3.2.4  identifier

   An integral value which serves as an identifier.  Specifically
   mathematical operations on two identifiers (aside from the equality
   operation) are meaningless.  For example, Autonomous System Id 1 *
   Autonomous System Id 2 is meaningless.

3.2.5  flags

   An integral value which actually represents a set of bit fields.
   Logical operations are appropriate on such values, but not other
   mathematical operations.  Flags should always be of an unsigned type.

4.  Information Element Identifiers

   The elements of this information model are identified by the
   combination of a field identifier and an optional enterprise
   identifier.

   Standardized information elements defined in section 5 of this
   document or in extensions of the IPFIX information model have their
   values assigned by IANA.  These values are in the range of 1 - 32767.
   In this range, the value of the most significant bit in a
   16-bit-representation always equals 0.

   Enterprise-specific field IDs are in the range of 32768 - 65535.  In
   this range, the value of the most significant bit in a
   16-bit-representation always equals 1.  This choice of ranges allows
   a Collecting Process to clearly and easily distinguished standardized
   fields from enterprise-specific fields by just checking a single bit.

   +---------------------------------+---------------------------------+
   | Field ID Range                  | Description                     |
   +---------------------------------+---------------------------------+
   | 0                               | reserved                        |
   |                                 |                                 |
   | 1 - 127                         | standardized field IDs          |
   |                                 | compatible to NetFlow version 9 |
   |                                 |                                 |
   | 128 - 32767                     | standardized field IDs assigned |
   |                                 | by IANA                         |
   |                                 |                                 |
   | 32768 - 65535                   | enterprise-defined field IDs    |
   +---------------------------------+---------------------------------+

   Enterprise-specific IDs can be chosen by an enterprise arbitrarily
   within the given range.  The same ID may be assigned by different
   enterprises for different purposes.  In order to ensure that
   Collecting Processes can always identify information elements
   uniquely, enterprise-specific information elements are identified by
   the combination of a field ID and an enterprise ID.  Valid valuse for
   enterprise IDs are also assigned by IANA.  The IPFIX information
   model uses the SMI network management private enterprise code defined
   at http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers as the set of
   valid numbers for enterprise IDs.  Enterprise IDs used for
   identifying IPFIX information elements MUST be registered as SMI
   network management private enterprise code numbers at IANA.

   The following list gives an overview of field IDs used as identifiers
   of the information elements specified in section 5.

5.  Information Elements

   This section describes the flow attributes of the IPFIX information
   model.  The elements are grouped into 8 groups according to their
   semantics and their applicability.

5.1  IP Header Fields

   Information elements in this section indicate values of header fields
   or are derived from IP header field values in combination with
   further information.  These information elements can serve as part of
   a flow key used for mapping packets to flows.  But also they may
   contain values related to header fields that are not constant for a
   single flow.  For example a flow using a certain source IPv4 address
   as flow key has sourceAddressV4 as constant property but may have
   destinationAddressV4 as a property that changes from packet to
   packet.

   For information elements that are not constant for a flow, the value
   MUST be the value of the first packet observed for this flow.  This
   simple rule allows writing all information elements related to header
   fields once when the first packet of the flow is observed.  For
   further observed packets of the same flow, only the counters need to
   be increased.

   The set of information elements related to IP header fields includes
   the information elements listed in the table below.

   +-------+-------------------------+-------+-------------------------+
   |    ID | Field Name              |    ID | Field Name              |

   |    27 | sourceIPv6Address       |    31 | flowLabelIPv6           |

   |    29 | sourceIPv6Mask          |     4 | protocolIdentifier      |
   |    44 | sourceIPv4Prefix        |       |                         |
   |    12 | destinationIPv4Address  |       |                         |
   |    28 | destinationIPv6Address  |       |                         |

5.7  Per-Flow Counters

   Information elements in this section are counters all having integral
   values.  Their values may change for every report they are used in.
   They cannot serve as part of a flow key used for mapping packets to
   flows.  However, potentially they can be used for selecting exported
   flow, for example by only exporting flows with more than a thresholh
   number of observed octets.

   There are running counters and delta counters.  Delta counters are
   reset to zero for each time their values are exported.  Running
   counters continue counting independent of the Exporting Process.

   There are per-flow counters and counters related to the Metering
   Process and/or the Exporting Process.  Per-flow counters are flow
   properites that potentially change each time a packets belonging to
   the flow is observed.  Per-flow counters are flow properites that
   potentially change each time a packet belonging to the flow is
   observed.  The set of per-flow counters includes the information
   elements listed in the table below.

6.  Extending the Information Model

   A key requirement for IPFIX is to allow for extending the set of
   information items which are reported for flows.  This section defines
   the mechanism for extending this set.

   The IPFIX protocol carries flow records defined by a template.
   Multiple templates may be defined for a dialog between an Exporter
   and a Collector.  A given template identifies the information items
   and their order.  The means of identification of information items in
   a template is via a field ID.  Field Id's are unique identifiers
   administered by IANA.

   Extension is done by defining new Information elements, including the
   set of necessary information and possibly additional optional
   information for each element.  Each new information item MUST be
   assigned a unique fieldId as part of its definition.  These unique
   field ids are the connection between the record structure
   communicated by the protocol using templates and a consuming
   application.

   Enterprise-specific extensions may be made by enterprises with an SMI
   network management private enterprise code defined by IANA at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers.
   Enterprise-specific field IDs do not need to be registered by IANA.
   The definition of a enterprise-specific information element MUST
   specify the enterprise ID as well as the enterprise-specified field
   ID and other mandatory field properties.  Before creating
   enterprise-specific fields, the general applicability of such
   information elements should be considered.  For generally applicable
   fields using IETF and IANA mechanisms for extending the information
   model is recommended.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has to create a new registry for IPFIX field ID's.

   Appendix B defines an XML schema which may be used to create
   consistent machine readable extensions to the IPFIX information
   model.  This schema introduces a new namespace, which will be
   assigned by IANA according to RFC 3688.  Currently the name space for
   this schema is identified as http://www.ietf.org/ipfix.

8.  Security Considerations

   The IPFIX information model itself does not directly introduce
   security issues.  Rather it defines a set of attributes which may for
   privacy or business issues be considered sensitive information.

   The underlying protocol used to exchange the information described
   here must therefore apply appropriate procedures to guarantee the
   integrity and confidentiality of the exported information.  Such
   protocols are defined in separate documents, specifically the IPFIX
   Protocol document [IPFIX-PROTO].

Appendix A.  Formal Specification of IPFIX Fields

   This appendix contains a formal description of the IPFIX information
   model XML document.  Note that this appendix is of informational
   nature, while the text in section 4 generated from this appendix is
   normative.

   Using a formal and machine readable syntax for the Information model
   enables the creation of IPFIX aware tools which can automatically
   adapt to extensions to the information model, by simply reading
   updated information model specifications.

   The wide availability of XML aware tools and libraries for client
   devices is a primary consideration for this choice.  In particular
   libraries for parsing XML documents are readily available.  Also
   mechanisms such as the Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) allow for
   transforming a source XML document into other documents.  This draft
   was authored in XML and transformed according to RFC2629.

   It should be noted that the use of XML in Exporters, Collectors or
   other tools is not mandatory for the deployment of IPFIX.  In
   particular Exporting Processes do not produce or consume XML as part
   of their operation.  It is expected that IPFIX Collectors MAY take
   advantage of the machine readability of the Information Model vs.
   hardcoding their behavior or inventing proprietary means for
   accomodating extensions.
