          Path Aware Networking: A Bestiary of Roads Not Taken
                 draft-dawkins-panrg-what-not-to-do-01

Abstract

   At the first meeting of the proposed Path Aware Networking Research
   Group, Oliver Bonaventure led a discussion of our mostly-unsuccessful
   attempts to exploit Path Awareness to achieve a variety of goals,
   over the past decade.  At the end of that discussion, the research
   group agreed to catalog and analyze these ideas, to extract insights
   and lessons for path-aware networking researchers.

   This document contains that catalog and analysis.

1.  Introduction

   At IETF 99, the proposed Path Aware Networking Research Group [PANRG]
   held its first meeting [PANRG-99], and the first presentation in that
   session was "A Decade of Path Awareness" [PATH-Decade].  At the end
   of this discussion, two things were abundantly clear.

   o  The Internet community has accumulated considerable experience
      with many Path Awareness ideas over a long period of time, and

   o  Although some Path Awareness ideas have been successfully deployed
      (for example, Differentiated Services, or DiffServ [RFC2475]),
      most of these ideas haven't seen widespread adoption.  The reasons
      for this non-adoption are many, and are worthy of study.

   The meta-lessons from this experience are

   o  Path Aware Networking is more Research than Engineering, so
      establishing an IRTF Research Group for Path Aware Networking is
      the right thing to do [RFC7418], and

   o  Cataloging and analyzing our experience to learn the reasons for
      non-adoption is a great first step for the proposed Research
      Group.

   This document contains that catalog and analysis.

1.1.  About this Document

   This document is not intended to include every idea about Path Aware
   Networking that we can find.  Instead, we include enough ideas to
   provide background for new lessons to guide researchers in their
   work, in order to add those lessons to Section 2.

1.2.  A Note for Contributors (Consider removing after approval)

   There is no shame to having your idea included in this document.
   When these proposals were made, we were trying to engineer something
   that was research.  The document editor started with a subsection on
   his own idea.  The only shame is not learning from experience, and
   not sharing that experience with other networking researchers and
   engineers.

   This document is being built collaboratively.  To contribute your
   experience, please send a Github pull request to
   https://github.com/panrg/draft-dawkins-panrg-what-not-to-do.

   Discussion of specific contributed experiences and this document in
   general should take place on the PANRG mailing list.

1.3.  A Note for the Editor (Remove after taking these actions)

   The to-do list for upcoming revisions includes

   o  Rearrange the Summary of Lessons Learned so that it flows (the
      current revision is more or less in the order of contributions).

   o  Tag the Lessons Learned so that they are tied to one or more
      specific contributions.

1.4.  Architectural Guidance

   As background for understanding the Lessons Learned contained in this
   document, the reader is encouraged to become familiar with the
   Internet Architecture Board's documents on "What Makes for a



Dawkins                 Expires December 20, 2018               [Page 3]

   Successful Protocol?"  [RFC5218] and "Planning for Protocol Adoption
   and Subsequent Transitions" [RFC8170].

   Although these two documents do not specifically target path-aware
   networking protocols, they are helpful resources on successful
   protocol adoption and deployment.

2.  Summary of Lessons Learned

   This section summarizes the Lessons Learned from the contributed
   sections in Section 4.

   o  The benefit of Path Awareness has to be great enough to overcome
      entropy for already-deployed devices.  The colloquial American
      English expression, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" is in full
      flower on today's Internet.

   o  If intermediate devices along the path can't be trusted, it's
      difficult to rely on intermediate devices to drive changes to
      endpoint behaviors.

   o  If operators can't charge for a Path Aware technology in order to
      recover the costs of deploying it, the benefits must be really
      significant.

   o  Impact of a Path Aware technology on operational practices can
      prevent deployment of promising technology.

   o  Per-connection state in intermediate devices is an impediment to
      adoption and deployment.

   o  Providing benefits for early adopters is key - if everyone must
      deploy a technology in order for the topology to provide benefits,
      or even to work at all, the technology is unlikely to be adopted.

   o  The Internet is a distributed system, so the more a technology
      relies on information propagated from distant hosts and routers,
      the less likely that information is to be accurate.

   o  Transport protocol technologies may require information from
      applications, in order to work effectively, but applications may
      not know the information they need to provide.

3.  Template for Contributions

   There are many things that could be said about the Path Aware
   networking technologies that have been developed.  For the purposes
   of this document, contributors are requested to provide

   o  the name of a technology, including an abbreviation if one was
      used

   o  if available, a long-term pointer to the best reference describing
      the technology

   o  a short description of the problem the technology was intended to
      solve

   o  a short description of the reasons why the technology wasn't
      adopted

   o  a short statement of the lessons that researchers can learn from
      our experience with this technology.

4.  Contributions

   The editor has added some suggested subsections as a starting place,
   but others are solicited and welcome.

4.1.  Integrated Services (IntServ)

   The suggested references for IntServ are:

   o  RFC 1633 Integrated Services in the Internet Architecture: an
      Overview [RFC1633]

   o  RFC 2211 Specification of the Controlled-Load Network Element
      Service [RFC2211]

   o  RFC 2212 Specification of Guaranteed Quality of Service [RFC2212]

   o  RFC 2215 General Characterization Parameters for Integrated
      Service Network Elements [RFC2215]

   o  RFC 2205 Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) [RFC2205]

   In 1994, when the IntServ architecture document [RFC1633] was
   published, real-time traffic was first appearing on the Internet.  At
   that time, bandwidth was a scarce commodity.  Internet Service
   Providers built networks over DS3 (45 Mbps) infrastructure, and sub-
   rate (< 1 Mpbs) access was common.  Therefore, the IETF anticipated a
   need for a fine-grained QoS mechanism.

   In the IntServ architecture, some applications require service
   guarantees.  Therefore, those applications use the Resource
   Reservation Protocol (RSVP) [RFC2205] to signal bandwidth
   reservations across the network.  Every router in the network

Internet-Draft               What Not To Do                    June 2018


   maintains per-flow state in order to a) perform call admission
   control and b) deliver guaranteed service.

   Applications use Flow Specification (Flow Specs) [RFC2210] to
   describe the traffic that they emit.  RSVP reserves bandwidth for
   traffic on a per Flow Spec basis.

4.1.1.  Reasons for Non-deployment

   IntServ was never widely deployed because of its cost.  The following
   factors contributed to cost:

   o  IntServ must be deployed on every router within the QoS domain

   o  IntServ maintained per flow state

   As IntServ was being discussed, the following occurred:

   o  It became more cost effective to solve the QoS problem by adding
      bandwidth.  Between 1994 and 2000, Internet Service Providers
      upgraded their infrastructures from DS3 ( 45 Mbps ) to OC-48 ( 2.4
      Gbps )

   o  DiffServ [RFC2475] offered a more cost-effective, albeit less
      fine-grained, solution to the QoS problem.

4.1.2.  Lessons Learned.

   The following lessons were learned:

   o  Any mechanism that requires a router to maintain state is not
      likely to succeed.

   o  Any mechanism that requires an operator to upgrade all of its
      routers is not likely to succeed.

   IntServ was never widely deployed.  However, the technology that it
   produced was deployed for reasons other than bandwidth management.
   RSVP is widely deployed as an MPLS signaling mechanism.  BGP uses
   Flow Specs to distribute firewall filters.

4.2.  Quick-Start TCP

   Quick-Start [RFC4782] is an experimental TCP extension that leverages
   support from the routers on the path to determine an allowed sending
   rate, either at the start of data transfers or after idle periods.
   In these cases, a TCP sender cannot easily determine an appropriate
   sending rate, given the lack of information about the path.  The



Dawkins                 Expires December 20, 2018               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft               What Not To Do                    June 2018


   default TCP congestion control therefore uses the time-consuming
   slow-start algorithm.  With Quick-Start, connections are allowed to
   use higher sending rates if there is significant unused bandwidth
   along the path, and if the sender and all of the routers along the
   path approve the request.  By examining Time To Live (TTL) fields, a
   sender can determine if all routers have approved the Quick-Start
   request.  The protocol also includes a nonce that provides protection
   against cheating routers and receivers.  If the Quick-Start request
   is explicitly approved by all routers along the path, the TCP host
   can send at up to the approved rate; otherwise TCP would use the
   default congestion control.  Quick-Start requires modifications in
   the involved end-systems as well in routers.  Due to the resulting
   deployment challenges, Quick-Start has been being proposed in
   [RFC4782] for controlled environments such as intranets only.

   The Quick-Start protocol is a lightweight, coarse-grained, in-band,
   network-assisted fast startup mechanism.  The benefits are studied by
   simulation in a research paper [SAF07] that complements the protocol
   specification.  The study confirms that Quick-Start can significantly
   speed up mid-sized data transfers.  That paper also presents router
   algorithms that do not require keeping per-flow state.  Later studies
   [Sch11] comprehensively analyzes Quick-Start with a full Linux
   implementation and with a router fast path prototype using a network
   processor.  In both cases, Quick-Start could be implemented with
   limited additional complexity.

4.2.1.  Reasons for Non-deployment

   However, the experiments with Quick-Start in [Sch11] reveal several
   challenges:

   o  Having information from the routers along the path can reduce the
      risk of congestion, but it cannot avoid it entirely.  Determining
      whether there is unused capacity is not trivial in actual router
      and host implementations.  Data about available bandwidth visible
      at the IP layer may be imprecise, and due to the propagation
      delay, information can already be outdated when it reaches the
      sender.  There is a trade-off between the speedup of data
      transfers and the risk of congestion even with Quick-Start.

   o  For scalable router fast path implementation, it is important to
      enable parallel processing of packets, as this is a widely used
      method e.g. in network processors.  One challenge is
      synchronization of information between different packets, which
      should be avoided as much as possible.

   o  Only selected applications can benefit from Quick-Start.  For
      achieving an overall benefit, it is important that senders avoid

Internet-Draft               What Not To Do                    June 2018


      sending unnecessary Quick-Start requests, e.g. for connections
      that will only send a small amount of data.  This typically
      requires application-internal knowledge.  It is a mostly unsolved
      question how a sender can indeed determine the data rate that
      Quick-Start shall request for.

   After completion of the Quick-Start specification, there have been
   large-scale experiments with an initial window of up to 10 MSS
   [RFC6928].  This alternative "IW10" approach can also ramp up data
   transfers faster than the standard TCP congestion control, but it
   only requires sender-side TCP modifications.  As a result, this
   approach can be easier and incrementally deployed in the Internet.
   While theoretically Quick-Start can outperform "IW10", the absolute
   improvement of data transfer times is rather small in many cases.
   After publication of [RFC6928], most modern TCP stacks have increased
   their default initial window.  There is no known deployment of Quick-
   Start TCP.

4.2.2.  Lessons Learned

   There are some lessons learned from Quick-Start.  Despite being a
   very light-weight protocol, Quick-Start suffers from poor incremental
   deployment properties, both regarding the required modifications in
   network infrastructure as well as its interactions with applications.
   Except for corner cases, congestion control can be quite efficiently
   performed end-to-end in the Internet, and in modern TCP stacks there
   is not much room for significant improvement by additional network
   support.

4.3.  Triggers for Transport (TRIGTRAN)

   TCP [RFC0793] has a well-known weakness - the end-to-end flow control
   mechanism has only a single signal, the loss of a segment, and semi-
   modern TCPs (since the late 1980s) have interpreted the loss of a
   segment as evidence that the path between two endpoints has become
   congested enough to exhaust buffers on intermediate hops, so that the
   TCP sender should "back off" - reduce its sending rate until it knows
   that its segments are now being delivered without loss [RFC2581].
   More modern TCPs have added a growing array of strategies about how
   to establish the sending rate [RFC5681], but when a path is no longer
   operational, TCPs can wait many seconds before retrying a segment,
   even if the path becomes operational while the sender is waiting to
   retry.

   The thinking in Triggers for Transport was that if a path completely
   stopped working because its first-hop link was "down", that somehow
   TCP could be signaled when the first-hop link returned to service,




Dawkins                 Expires December 20, 2018               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft               What Not To Do                    June 2018


   and the sending TCP could retry immediately, without waiting for a
   full Retransmission Time Out (RTO).

4.3.1.  Reasons for Non-deployment

   Two TRIGTRAN BOFs were held, at IETF 55 [TRIGTRAN-55] and IETF 56
   [TRIGTRAN-56], but this work was not chartered, and there was no
   interest in deploying TRIGTRAN unless it was chartered in the IETF.

4.3.2.  Lessons Learned.

   The reasons why this work was not chartered provide several useful
   lessons for researchers.

   o  TRIGTRAN triggers are only provided when the first-hop link is
      "down", so TRIGTRAN triggers couldn't replace normal TCP
      retransmission behavior if the path failed because some link
      further along the network path was "down".  So TRIGTRAN triggers
      added complexity to an already complex TCP state machine, and
      didn't allow any existing complexity to be removed.

   o  The state of the art in the early 2000s was that TRIGTRAN triggers
      were assumed to be unauthenticated, so they couldn't be trusted to
      tell a sender to "speed up", only to "slow down".  This reduced
      the potential benefit to implementers.

   o  intermediate forwarding devices required modification to provide
      TRIGTRAN triggers, but operators couldn't charge for TRIGTRAN
      triggers, so there was no way to recover the cost of modifying,
      testing, and deploying updated intermediate devices.

4.4.  Shim6

   The IPv6 routing architecture [RFC1887] assumed that most sites on
   the Internet would be identified by Provider Assigned IPv6 prefixes,
   so that Default-Free Zone routers only contained routes to other
   providers, resulting in a very small routing table.

   For a single-homed site, this could work well.  A multi-homed site
   with only one upstream provider could also work well, although BGP
   multihoming from a single upstream provider was often a premium
   service (costing more than twice as much as two single-homed sites),
   and if the single upstream provider went out of service, all of the
   multi-homed paths could fail simultaneously.

   IPv4 sites often multihomed by obtaining Provider Independent
   prefixes, and advertising these prefixes through multiple upstream
   providers.  With the assumption that any multihomed IPv4 site would



Dawkins                 Expires December 20, 2018               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft               What Not To Do                    June 2018


   also multihome in IPv6, it seemed likely that IPv6 routing would be
   subject to the same pressures to announce Provider Independent
   prefixes, resulting in a global IPv6 routing table that exhibited the
   same problems as the global IPv4 routing table.  During the early
   2000s, work began on a protocol that would provide the same benefits
   for multihomed IPv6 sites without requiring sites to advertise
   Provider Independent prefixes into the global routing table.

   This protocol, called Shim6, allowed two endpoints to exchange
   multiple addresses ("Locators") that all mapped to the same endpoint
   ("Identity").  After an endpoint learned multiple Locators for the
   other endpoint, it could send to any of those Locators with the
   expectation that those packets would all be delivered to the endpoint
   with the same Identity.  Shim6 was an example of an "Identity/Locator
   Split" protocol.

   Shim6, as defined in [RFC5533] and related RFCs, provided a workable
   solution for IPv6 multihoming using Provider Assigned prefixes,
   including capability discovery and negotiation, and allowing end-to-
   end application communication to continue even in the face of path
   failure, because applications don't see Locator failures, and
   continue to communicate with the same Identity using a different
   Locator.

4.4.1.  Reasons for Non-deployment

   Note that the problem being addressed was "site multihoming", but
   Shim6 was providing "host multihoming".  That meant that the decision
   about what path would be used was under host control, not under
   router control.

   Although more work could have been done to provide a better technical
   solution, the biggest impediments to Shim6 deployment were
   operational and business considerations.  These impediments were
   discussed at multiple network operator group meetings, including
   [Shim6-35] at [NANOG-35].

   The technology issues centered around scaling concerns that Shim6
   relied on the host to track all the TCP connections and the file
   descriptions with associated HTTP state, while also tracking
   Identity/Locator mappings in the kernel, and tracking failures to
   recognize that a backup path has failed.

   The operator issues centered around concerns that operators were
   performing traffic engineering, but would have no visibility or
   control over hosts when they chose to begin using another path, and
   relying on hosts to engineer traffic exposed their networks to
   oscillation based on feedback loops, as hosts move from path to path.

Internet-Draft               What Not To Do                    June 2018


   At a minimum, traffic engineering policies must be pushed down to
   individual hosts.  In addition, the usual concerns about firewalls
   that expected to find a transport-level protocol header in the IP
   payload, and won't be able to perform firewalling functions because
   its processing logic would have to look past the Identity header.

   The business issues centered removing or reducing the ability to sell
   BGP multihoming service, which is often more expensive than single-
   homed connectivity.

4.4.2.  Lessons Learned

   It is extremely important to take operational concerns into account
   when a path-aware protocol is making decisions about path selection
   that may conflict with existing operational practices and business
   considerations.

   We also note that some path-aware networking ideas recycle.  Although
   Shim6 did not achieve significant deployment, the IETF chartered a
   working group to specify "Multipath TCP" [MP-TCP] in 2009, and
   Multipath TCP allows TCP applications to control path selection, with
   many of the same advantages and disadvantages of Shim6.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document describes ideas that were not adopted and widely
   deployed on the Internet, so it doesn't affect the security of the
   Internet.

   If this document meets its goals, we may develop new ideas for Path
