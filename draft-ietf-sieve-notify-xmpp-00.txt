1.  Introduction

1.1  Overview

   The [NOTIFY] extension to the [SIEVE] mail filtering language is a
   framework for providing notifications by employing URIs to specify
   the notification mechanism.  This document defines how xmpp URIs (see
   [XMPP-URI]) are used to generate notifications via the Extensible
   Messaging and Presence Protocol (see [XMPP]), also known as Jabber.

1.2  Terminology

   This document inherits terminology from [NOTIFY], [SIEVE], and
   [XMPP].

   The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
   "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [TERMS].

2.  Definition

   The xmpp mechanism results in the sending of an XMPP message to
   notify a recipient about an email message.  The notification MUST be
   an XMPP <message/> stanza.  The value of the XMPP 'type' attribute
   MUST be 'headline' or 'normal'.  The value of the XMPP 'from'
   attribute MUST be the XMPP address of the notification service.  The
   XMPP <message/> stanza MAY include a <subject/> child element whose
   value is either the ":subject" tag or, absent that, some configurable
   text indicating that the message is a Sieve notification.

   The format of the notify action is described in the following
   sections.

2.1  Notify ":method" tag

   The notify ":method" tag MUST be a URI that conforms to the xmpp URI
   scheme (as specified in [XMPP-URI]) and that identifies an XMPP
   account associated with the email inbox.  The URI MAY include the
   resource identifier portion of an XMPP address but SHOULD NOT include
   an authority component, query component, or fragment identifier
   component.  The processing application MUST extract an XMPP address
   from the URI in accordance with the processing rules specified in
   [XMPP-URI].  The resulting XMPP address MUST be encapsulated in XMPP
   syntax as the value of the XMPP 'to' attribute.

2.2  Notify ":priority" tag

   The notify ":priority" tag has no special meaning for this
   notification mechanism, and this specification puts no restriction on
   its use.  The value of the notify ":priority" tag MAY be transformed
   into XMPP syntax; if so, it SHOULD be encapsulated as the value of an
   [XMPP-SHIM] header named "Urgency", and the XML character of that
   header SHOULD be "high", "medium", or "low".

3.  Example

   Consider the following Sieve notify action:

   notify :method "xmpp:romeo@example.com"
          :id "some-id"
          :priority "high"
          :message "<juliet@example.org> Wherefore art thou?";

   The resulting XMPP <message/> stanza might be as follows:

   <message from='notify.example.com'
            to='romeo@example.com'
            xml:lang='en'>
     <subject>A Sieve instant notification!</subject>
     <body>&lt;juliet@example.org&gt; Wherefore art thou?</body>
     <headers xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/shim'>
       <header name='Priority'>urgent</header>
     </headers>
   </message>


4.  Internationalization Considerations

   Although an XMPP address may contain nearly any [UNICODE] character,
   the value of the ":method" tag MUST be a Uniform Resource Identifier
   (see [URI]) rather than an Internationalized Resource Identifier (see
   [IRI]).  The rules specified in [XMPP-URI] MUST be followed when
   generating XMPP URIs.

5.  Security Considerations

   Detailed security considerations for the relevant protocols profiled
   in this document are given in [NOTIFY], [SIEVE], and [XMPP]; this
   document introduces no new security concerns above and beyond those
   described in the foregoing specifications.
