Abstract

   This document defines the procedures for IANA to administer and
   maintain the Object Identifier (OID) tree under the rmon root. This
   memo also documents the currently assigned values.

1. Introduction

   The RMONMIB Working Group so far has maintained its own registry for
   OID assignments for new MIB modules under the root OID for rmon
   [RFC2819]. This has worked reasonably well, although errors had to be
   corrected at a late stage one or two times, and a few now defunct
   assignments have been made as well.

   It is also a somewhat non-standard way of doing things, because
   normally a new standards track MIB module will get a MIB root
   assigned at the time that the module is being published as part of an
   RFC.

   This document lists the currently assigned rmon OIDs. It also
   describes the procedures and rules for new assignments and asks IANA
   to take over the responsibility for existing andi future assignments.

   The current assignments are not all too logical. Initialy normal MIB
   OIDs were assigned under rmon, but at a later time the WG used the
   rmon root OID to create new MIB modules underneath it. Some people
   will claim 'an OID is just an OID', and while this is true, it does
   not make things easier if the organisation of OIDs is not logical.
   However, we cannot change what has been assigned in the past. From
   now on, only MODULE-IDENTITY macro (MIB root) assignments will be
   made (by IANA) under the 'rmon' node. Within a MIB module, the
   working group authors/editors can then assign their own OIDs
   according to normal procedures.

2. Currently assigned OIDs under the rmon root

   At the time of this writing, the following OIDs have been assigned
   and IANA is requested to pick up this information in their public
   registry of assigned values. These should be listed as part of the
   already existing smi-numbers registry at

       http://www.iana.org/assignments/smi-numbers.

       ...mib-2.rmon (1.3.6.1.2.1.16)

   The assignments under ...mib-2.rmon were maintained by the RMONMIB
   Working Group until publication of RFC XXXX. Some (early) assignments
   may not look all too logical. That is true, but that is history and
   cannot be changed. From now on, only MODULE-IDENTITY macro (MIB root)
   assignments will be made (by IANA) under the 'rmon' node.

3. How to request a new assignment for a MIB module

   When anyone is writing a internet-draft for which a new assignment is
   needed/wanted under the rmon OID, then the proper way to do so is as
   follows:

         EXAMPLE-MIB DEFINITIONS ::= BEGIN

         IMPORTS
           rmon          FROM RMON-MIB

           .. other imports ..

         exampleMIB  MODULE-IDENTITY

           ... other normal MODULE-IDENTITY stuff ...

         ::= { rmon nnn }  -- IANA: please assign nnn
                           -- RFC-Editor: replace nnn with IANA-assigned
                           --             number and remove this note

   IANA will assign the number as part of the RFC publication process.

4. Security Considerations

   This memo describes procedures for IANA assignment of OBJECT
   IDENTIFIER values, and has no impact on the security of the Internet.

5. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to pick up the initial set of assignments and
   integrate them into the existing registry for smi-numbers at

         http://www.iana.org/assignments/smi-numbers

   The list is presented in Section 2.

   IANA is also requested to maintain this registry for future
   assignments. New assignments can only be made via Standards Action as
   described in [RFC2434].

   IANA will assign the number as part of the RFC publication process.

6. Acknowledgments

   This document was produced as a result of discussion between the
   Operations and Management AD responsible for Network Management and
   the WG chair for the RMONMIB Working Group. Thanks to Andy Bierman
   for keeping and administering the registry up to this point in time.

   The document has been reviewed by the RMONMIB Working Group.
