     22 Aug 2002   Minor editorial changes and clean-up

                   Restored inetCidrRouteNextHopType variable (may be

     13 Jul 2002   Removed inetCidrRouteNextHopType.   
  
    Changes from draft-ops-rfc2096-update-00.txt: 
     
     12 Jul 2001   Renamed to IPNG working group draft

                   Added inetCidrRouteDiscards to replace 
                   ipRoutingDiscards 
                   Fixed some remaining ipCidr*/inetCidr* confusion in 
                   DESCRIPTIONs 
  
    Changes from first draft posted to v6mib mailing list:

                   Deleted inetCidrRouteTos, add inetCidrRouteInstance   
                   in INDEX of inetCidrRouteTable. 
                    
                   Used InterfaceIndex, InetAddressPrefixLength and 
                   InetAutonomousSystemNumber TC's, and limited the SIZE 
                   of inetCidrRouteDest and inetCidrRouteNextHop

    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in

 3  The Internet-Standard Management Framework 
     
    For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
    Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 
    of RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
     
    Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
    termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are 
    generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol 
    (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms 
    defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This 
    memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which 
    is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 
    [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580]. 
     
 4  Overview 
     
    The MIB consists of one current table and two current global 
    objects. 
     
         1. The object inetCidrRouteNumber indicates the number of 
            current routes.  This is primarily to avoid having to read 
            the table in order to determine this number. 
  
         2. The object inetCidrRouteDiscards counts the number of valid 
            routes that were discarded for any reason. 
     
         3. The inetCidrRouteTable provides the ability to display IP 
            version independent multipath CIDR routes. 
     
    In addition, there is one deprecated table and object, and one 
    obsolete table and object, representing previous revisions of this 
    MIB. 
     
         1. The obsolete object ipForwardNumber represents the number of 
            entries in the obsolete ipForwardTable. 
     
         2. The obsolete ipForwardTable updates the RFC 1213 
            ipRouteTable to display multipath IP Routes.  This is in 
            turn obsoleted by the ipCidrRouteTable. 
     
         3. The deprecated object ipCidrRouteNumber represents the 
            number of entries in the deprecated ipCidrRouteTable. 
     
         4. The deprecated ipCidrRouteTable updates the RFC 1213 
            ipRouteTable to display multipath IP Routes having the same 
            network number but differing network masks.

 6  Security Considerations 
  
    There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module 
    with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such 
    objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
    environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
    environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
    network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their 
    sensitivity/vulnerability: 
     
       1. The inetCidrRouteTable contains routing and forwarding 
         information that is critical to the operation of the network 
         node (especially routers).  Allowing unauthenticated write 
         access to this table can compromise the validity of the 
         forwarding information. 
  
    Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with 
    a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive 
    or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important 
    to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and 
    possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending 
    them over the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects 
    and their sensitivity/vulnerability: 
     
       1. The inetCidrRouteTable contains routing and forwarding 
         information that can be used to compromise a network.  
         Specifically, this table can be used to construct a map of the 
         network in preparation for a denial-of-service attack on the 
         network infrastructure. 
       2. The inetCidrRouteProto object identifies the routing protocols 
         in use within a network.  This information can be used to 
         determine how a denial-of-service attack should be launched. 
     
    SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.  
    Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), 
    even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is 
    allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the 
    objects in this MIB module. 
     
    It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features 
    as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), 
    including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for 
    authentication and privacy). 
     
    Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
    RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
    enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
    responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
    instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access 
    to the objects only to those principals (users) that have 
    legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
