0. Background

   In the ITU-T SG11 WP1 Kochi meeting held in January 1998, SG11 WP1,
   which has responsibility for the B-ISDN signaling protocol
   recommendation, decided to discuss B-ISDN signalling support for the
   Internet protocol based on draft-suzuki-git-uus-assignment-00.txt.

   In the ITU-T SG11 Geneva meeting held in May 1998, WP1 decided to
   enhance the Q.2941 Generic Identifier Transport based on draft-
   suzuki-git-uus-assignment-02.txt and developed the Awaiting-review
   text (initial draft) [4].  WP1 also decided to continue discussion on
   the User-to-user signaling support for the Internet protocol.
   Expected standard development process (fastest case) for the
   enhancement of the Generic Identifier is:

   November 1998: Enhance the Awaiting-review text based on inputs and
     develop the Cooling text (Draft Recommendations to be frozen in the
     next meeting, if no significant technical changes are proposed in
     that meeting).

   March 1999: Freeze the Draft Recommendations and letter ballot is
     requested.

   February 2000: The Draft Recommendations are decided (final
     approval).

   The purpose of this document is to specify the assignment of the
   information field and protocol identifier in the Q.2941 Generic
   Identifier and Q.2957 User-to-user Signaling for the Internet
   protocol.  To enable this specification, section 6 of this document
   clarifies amendments to the current User-to-user Signaling.  ITU-T
   SG11 will enhance the current User-to-user Signaling based on this
   clarification.

   Note that the assignment rule for Generic Identifer described in this
   document may be subject to change.

   Note that the assignment rule for the User-to-user Signaling
   described in this document may be subject to change, so it should not
   be implemented until ITU-T SG11 WP1 decides to enhance the User-to-
   user Signaling based on this request.

1. Purpose of Document

   The purpose of this document is to specify the assignment of the
   information field and protocol identifier in the Q.2941 Generic
   Identifier and Q.2957 User-to-user Signaling for the Internet
   protocol.

   The assignment, that is specified in section 4 of this document, is
   designed for advanced B-ISDN signaling support of the Internet
   protocol, especially the B-ISDN signaling support for the connection
   that corresponds to the session in the Internet protocol which is
   clarified in section 2.  Needless to say, the purpose of this
   specification is not limited to this support, and it should also be
   applicable to other purposes.

   This specification provides an indispensable framework for the
   implementation of long-lived session and QoS-sensitive session
   transfers over ATM.  Note that this document only specifies the
   assignment of the information field and protocol identifier, and that
   it may not specify complete protocol that enables interoperable
   implementation.  This is because it is beyond the scope of this
   document and will be specified in a separate document.


2. Session-related ATM Connection

   With the development of new multimedia applications on the current
   Internet, the demands for multimedia support are increasing in the IP
   network, which currently supports best effort communications.  In
   particular, demands to support QoS guaranteed communications are
   increasing with the development of voice, audio, and video
   communications applications.  And it may also be necessary to
   introduce the mechanism that can efficiently transfer the huge volume
   of traffic expected with these applications.

   The major features of B-ISDN are high speed, logical multiplexing
   with the VP/VC, and flexible QoS management per VC, so it is quite
   natural to use these distinctive functions of B-ISDN to implement a
   multimedia support mechanism in the IP network.  The flexible QoS
   management and logical multiplexing functions in B-ISDN are the
   expected method of implementing the QoS guaranteed communications in
   the Internet.  And when a long-lived session is supported by a
   particular VC, efficient packet forwarding may be possible using the
   high speed and logical multiplexing of B-ISDN.

   This section clarifies B-ISDN signaling functions that are required
   when the session is supported by the VC, for advanced B-ISDN
   signaling support of the Internet protocol.


2.1 Long-lived Session Signaling

   An example scenario for establishing a VC for a long-lived session is
   shown in Fig. 2.1.

   First, a session is multiplexed into the default VC connecting the
   routers.  Then, if a router detects that it is a long-lived session,
   it sets up a new VC for the session.  If the new VC is established
   successfully, the long-lived session is moved to the new VC.

   In this procedure involving an ATM VC setup, the B-ISDN signaling
   entity in the called side router must detect that the incoming call
   corresponds to a session of the Internet protocol and notify that
   fact to the IP layer entity.  Based on this information, the IP layer
   entity moves the session to the new VC.

   Therefore, to implement this signaling procedure, the B-ISDN
   signaling must include an session identifier as an information
   element.  The B-LLI, B-HLI, User-user, and Generic Identifier
   information elements are all capable of transferring this
   information.  Considering the original purposes of these information
   elements, the most appropriate one to use is the Generic Identifier
   information element.


2.2 QoS-sensitive Session Signaling

   The major difference between QoS-sensitive session signaling and
   long-lived session signaling is that call setup is not initiated by
   the detection of a long-lived session, but is explicitly initiated by
   the setup protocol such as ST2+ and RSVP.  To implement QoS-sensitive
   session signaling using ATM, the ATM network between the routers must
   forward not only the session identifier but also the setup protocol.

   There are two schemes for forwarding the setup protocol.  One is to
   multiplex the protocol into a default VC connecting the routers, or
   to forward the protocol through a particular VC.  In this case, the
   QoS-sensitive session and the ATM VC are established sequentially.
   The second scheme is to forward the setup protocol as an information
   element in the B-ISDN signaling.  In this case, the QoS-sensitive
   session and the ATM VC are established simultaneously.  The latter
   scheme has the following advantages compared with the former one.

   o Easier to implement.

     - Admission control is simplified, because admission control for
       the IP and ATM layers can be done simultaneously.

     - Watchdog timer processing is simplified, because there is no need
       to watch the IP layer establishment and ATM layer establishment
       sequentially.

   o If the setup protocol supports negotiation, then an ATM VC whose

     QoS is based on the result of negotiation can be established.

   However, the latter scheme, at least, cannot support a case where a
   PVC is used to support a QoS-sensitive session.  Therefore, both
   procedures should be taken into account.

   An example of a message sequence that simultaneously establishes a
   QoS-sensitive session and an ATM VC is shown in Fig. 2.2.

             ATM VC establishment.

   Both ST2+ and RSVP are currently proposed for the setup protocol and
   new setup protocols are likely to be developed in the near future.
   Therefore, to generalize the discussion, the procedure for the setup
   protocol in this example is the general connection setup procedure
   using confirmed service.

   To implement this signaling procedure, the B-ISDN signaling must
   include the User-user information element that the capacity is
   sufficient to forward the setup protocol.


3. Overview of the Generic Identifier and User-to-user Signaling

3.1 Overview of the Generic Identifier

   The Generic Identifier enables the transfer of identifiers between
   end-to-end users in the ATM network, and it is defined in the Q.2941
   Part 1 (Q.2941.1) and Part 2 (Q.2941.2) as an optional information
   element for the Q.2931 and Q.2971 UNI signaling protocol.  The SETUP,
   ALERTING, CONNECT, RELEASE, RELEASE COMPLETE, ADD PARTY, PARTY
   ALERTING, ADD PARTY ACK, ADD PARTY REJECT, DROP PARTY, and DROP PARTY
   ACK messages that are transferred between end-to-end users in the ATM
   network may contain up to three Generic Identifier information
   elements.  The ATM network transfers the Generic Identifier
   information element transparently if it contains no coding rule
   errors.

   The format of the Generic Identifier information element specified in
   the Q.2941 is shown in Fig. 3.1.

   Identifier related standard/application field for the Intenet
   protocol is as follows.  A leading 0x means hexadecimal.

     0x03: IPv4.

     0x04: ST2+.

     0x05: IPv6.

     0x06: MPLS.

   Note: DSM-CC, H.310/H.321, and AAL2 application are also supported.

   A transferred identifier is given by the combination of the
   Identifier type, length and value fields, and a Generic Identifier
   information element may contain multiple identifiers.

   Assignment of the Identifier type field for the Intenet protocol is
   as follows.  A leading 0x means hexadecimal.

     0x01: Session.

     0x02: Resource.

     0x03-0xFD: Reserved for IANA assignment.

     0xFE: Experiment/Organization specific.

   The maximum length of the Generic Identifier information element is
   63 octets. (See Draft Q.2941.2.)

   See the Q.2941.1 and Draft Q.2941.2 for detailed protocol
   specifications of the Generic Identifier.


3.2 Overview of the User-to-user Signaling

   The User-to-user Signaling enables the transfer of information
   between end-to-end users in the ATM network, and it is defined in
   Q.2957 and in Q.2971 annex D as an optional information element for
   the Q.2931 and Q.2971 UNI signaling protocol.  The SETUP, ALERTING,
   CONNECT, RELEASE, RELEASE COMPLETE, PROGRESS, ADD PARTY, PARTY
   ALERTING, ADD PARTY ACK, ADD PARTY REJECT, DROP PARTY, and DROP PARTY
   ACK messages that are transferred between end-to-end users in the ATM
   network may contain a User-user information element.  The ATM network
   transfers the User-user information element transparently if it
   contains no coding rule errors.

   From the viewpoint of B-ISDN signaling applications, it seems the
   Generic Identifier and User-to-user Signaling are similar functions.
   But their rules for processing exceptions are not completely the
   same, because their purposes are different. The Generic Identifier is
   designed for the transfer of identifiers between the c-planes, while
   the User-to-user Signaling is designed for the transfer of user data
   via the c-planes.  Another difference is that the latter supports
   interworking with the user-user information element in the Q.931 N-
   ISDN signaling, but the Generic Identifier does not.  Note that the

   The Identifier related standard/application field is the IPv4, ST2+,
   IPv6, or MPLS.

   The Identifier type field is the Session, Resource, or
   Experiment/Organization specific.

   The Identifier value field is assigned to Internet protocol related
   information which is identified by the Identifier related
   standard/application field and Identifier type field.  The following
   identifiers are specified.

                                     Std./app.               Id type

   As described in section 3.1, the B-ISDN signaling message transferred
   between end-to-end users may contain up to three Generic Identifier
   information elements.  These elements may contain multiple
   identifiers.  This document does not specify the order of identifiers
   when multiple identifiers appear in a signaling message.

   This document also does not specify the semantics when multiple
   identifiers having the same Identifier type appear in a signaling
   message, or when a signaling message contains a Generic Identifier
   information element that does not contain identifiers.

   When a B-ISDN signaling message containing a Generic Identifier
   information element enters an ATM network that does not support the
   Generic Identifier, the network clears the call, discards the
   information element, or discards the signaling message.  (See
   sections 4.5.1 and 5.6.8.1 of Q.2931 and section 9.3 of Q.2941.1 for
   details.)

   To enable reliable Generic Identifier information element transfer,
   when the calling party sends a SETUP or ADD PARTY message with up to
   three Generic Identifier information elements, the CONNECT or ADD
   PARTY ACK message returned by the called party must contain at least
   one Generic Identifier information element.  The called party may not
   respond with the same identifiers received from the calling party.

   The calling party should confirm that the response message contains
   at least one Generic Identifier information element.


4.1.2 IPv4 session identifier

   If the Identifier related standard/application field in the Generic

   Fig. 4.7: Principle of assignment in the User-user information element.

   The Protocol discriminator field is the Internet protocol/application
   (TBD).  In this case, the first 1 octet in the User information field
   is the Internet protocol/application identifier field.

   Assignment of the Internet protocol/application identifier field is
   as follows.  A leading 0x means hexadecimal.

     0x00: Reserved.

     0x01: ST2+ SCMP.

     0x02: RSVP message.

     0x03-0xFD: Reserved for IANA assignment.

     0xFE: Experiment/Organization specific.

5. Open Issues

   The following issues are still remain in this document.

   o Generic Identifier support for session aggregation.

     Session aggregation support may be needed in a backbone
     environment.  Wild card style aggregated session identifier may be
     feasible.  However, before specifying Generic Identifier support
     for it, session aggregation model in ATM VCs should be clarified.

   o Generic Identifier support for the IPv6 flow label and traffic
     classes.

     The IPv6 flow label and traffic classes support may be needed in
     future.  However, currently their semantics are not clear.


6. Required Amendments to the User-to-user Signaling

   The information field and protocol identifier assignment in the
   Generic Identifier information element and User-user information
   element, which are described in section 4, are required for advanced
   B-ISDN signaling support of the Internet protocol.

   To enable advanced B-ISDN signaling support for the Internet
   protocol, the following amendments should be applied to the Q.2957
   and Q.2971 annex D User-to-user Signaling.

   o Add the Internet protocol/application to the Protocol
     discriminator.

   o Increase the maximum length of the User-user information element to
     sufficiently long, e.g. 262 octets, to forward the setup protocol
     such as ST2+ and RSVP.  This amendment is not applied and remains
     133 octets when the User-user information element interworks with
     the N-ISDN user-user information element.


7. Security Considerations

   This document specifies the information field and protocol identifier
   assignment in the Q.2941 Generic Identifier and Q.2957 User-to-user
   Signaling for the Internet protocol, so these do not weaken the
   security of the B-ISDN signaling.

   In a called party of the B-ISDN signaling, if the incoming SETUP
   message contains the calling party number and if it is verified and
   passed by the ATM network or it is provided by the network, then it
   is feasible to use the calling party number for part of the calling
   party authentication to strengthen security.
