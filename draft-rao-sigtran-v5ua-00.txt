Abstract


This document defines a mechanism for backhauling of V5.2
messages over IP by extending the ISDN User Adaptation Layer
Protocol (<draft-ietf-sigtran-iua-03.txt>). The document
aims to become an Appendix to IUA and to be the base for a
V5.2 implementation.

Internet Draft V5.2				  July, 2000


1.  Introduction

This document describes a method of implementing V5.2 back-
haul messaging over IP using a modified version of the ISDN
User Adapation Layer Protocol (IUAP). The document aims to
become an Appendix to IUA and to be the base for the "appli-
cation guide".

1.1.  Scope

There is a need for a V5.2 backhaul to meet the following
access types:
	  - Analog telephone access
	  - ISDN Basic rate access
	  - ISDN Primary Rate access (V5.2)
	  - Other analog or digital accesses for semi-
	  permanent connections without associated outband
	  signaling information


1.2.  Terminology

Bearer Channel Connection (BCC) protocol - A protocol which
allows the LE to instruct the AN to allocate bearer chan-
nels, either singly or in multiples, on demand.

Communication channel (C-channel) - A 64 kbit/s time slot on
a V5.2 interface provisioned to carry communication paths.

Communication path (C-path) - Any one of the following
information types:
	  - The layer 2 data link carrying the Control pro-
	  tocol
	  - The layer 2 data link carrying the Link Control
	  protocol
	  - The layer 2 data link carrying the PSTN signal-
	  ling
	  - Each of the layer 2 data links carrying the pro-
	  tection protocol
	  - The layer 2 data link carrying the BCC protocol
	  - All the ISDN Ds-type data from one or more user
	  ports
	  - All the ISDN p-type data from one or more user
	  ports
	  - All the ISDN t-type data from one or more user
	  ports

Note: This definition includes the possibility that there is
more than one C-path of the same information type, each
allocated to a different logical C-channel.

Logical Communication channel (Logical C-channel) - A group
of one or more C-paths, all of different types, but exclud-
ing the C-path for the protection protocol.

Internet Draft V5.2				  July, 2000


Multi-link - A collection of more than one 2.048 kbit/s link
which together make up a V5.2 interface.

Multi-Slot - A group of more than one 64kbit/s channels pro-
viding 8Khz and time slot sequence integrity, generally used
together within an ISDN Primary Rate Access (ISDN-PRA) user
port, in order to supply a higher bit-rate service.

Physical Communication Channel (Physical C-channel) - A
64kbit/s time slot on a V5.2 interface which has been
assigned for carrying logical C-channels. A physical C-
channel may not be used for carrying bearer channels.

Primary Link - A 2.048 kbit/s link in a multi-link V5.2
interface whose physical C-channel in time slot 16 carries a
C-path for the protection protocol and, on V5.2 initializa-
tion, also the C-path for the control protocol, link control
protocol, and the BCC protocol. Other C-paths may also be
carried in the time slot 16.

Secondary Link	- A 2.048 kbit/s link in a multi-link V5.2
interface whose time slot 16 carries a C-path for the pro-
tection protocol, and, on V5.2 initialization, acts as the
standby C-channel for the control protocol, link control
protocol, and BCC protocol and any other C-paths initially
carried in time slot 16 of the primary link.




2.  V5.2 Overview

V5.2 is an industry standard ETSI interface (reference ETS
300 347-1) defined between a Local Exchange (LE) and an
Access Network (AN) providing access to the following types:
	  - Analog telephone access
	  - ISDN Basic rate access
	  - ISDN Primary Rate access (V5.2)
	  - Other analog or digital accesses for semi-
	  permanent connections without associated outband
	  signaling information


The original V5 specification uses 2048 kbps links, V5.2 may
use upto 16 such interface links.

	----------		----------	  o--o
	|	 |	E1	|	 |-------  /\
	|	 |--------------|	 |	   --
	|   LE	 |	E1	|  AN	 |
	|	 |--------------|	 |	  o--o
	|	 |		|	 |-------  /\
	----------		----------	   --

Internet Draft V5.2				  July, 2000


LE and AN are connected with up to 16 E1 (PCM30) links.
Channels 16, 15 and 31 on any E1 link can be reserved for
data communication between LE and AN. The channels reserved
for data are called "Communication Channels" or "C-
Channels."

The C-Channels are the physical media to exchange data
between the V5.2 protocol peer entities, as well as to
transfer the ISDN BRI D-Ch messages between the terminals
and the LE. A logical communication path between two peer
entities is called a "C-path".

The signaling information in V5.2 are defined as:
	  - Analog signals are carried by means of the V5
	  PSTN protocol (L3)
	  - ISDN/analog ports are controlled by the V5 Con-
	  trol protocol (L3)
	  - ISDN protocol messages are mapped to LAPD
	  frames, which are carried by means of LAPV5-EF
	  sublayer (L2)
	  - V5 protocol messages are mapped to LAPV5-DL
	  frames, which are carried by means of LAPV5-EF
	  sublayer (L2)

In order to support more traffic and dynamic allocation of
links, the V5.2 protocol has several additions:
	  - A bearer channel connection protocol establishes
	  and de-establishes bearer connections required on
	  demand, identified by the signalling information,
	  under the control of the Local Exchange.
	  - A link control protocol is defined for the
	  multi-link management to control link identifica-
	  tion, link blocking and link failure conditions.
	  - A protection protocol, operated on two separate
	  data links for security reasons, is defined to
	  manage the protection switching of communication
	  channels in case of link failures.

The following protocols are defined for the various protocol
layers:
	  - LAPV5-EF
	  - LAPV5-DL
	  - V5-Link Control
	  - V5-BCC
	  - V5-PSTN
	  - V5-Control
	  - V5-Protection

The EFA identifies a  C-path, which is a 13-bit number,
ranging from 0 to 8191 (decimal). An EFA uniquely identifies
one of the five V5.2 protocols, or an ISDN agent attached to
an AN. The following list contains the possible values for
the EFA

	Definition		Value
	----------		------
	ISDN_PROTOCOL		0 - 8175
