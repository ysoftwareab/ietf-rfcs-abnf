Abstract

   This document describes the 'val:' Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
   scheme for denoting and describing datatype values which are
   represented by a pairing of the datatype and a lexical form.

Internet-Draft            The 'val:' URI Scheme               March 2002


1. Overview

   XML Schema [6] defines a simple datatype as consisting of a value
   space (a set of values), a lexical space (a set of lexical forms, or
   strings), and an N:1 mapping from members of the lexical space to
   members of the value space.  Thus, in the context of a given
   datatype, a lexical form (member of the lexical space) denotes one
   and only one value (member of the value space).  Thus the pairing of
   a datatype and a lexical form unambiguously identifies a specific
   value of that datatype.

   The 'val:' URI scheme is intended to provide a simple but consistent
   means by which a lexical form can be paired with a datatype URI
   allowing one to denote the datatype value represented by that
   pairing.

   Note: this URI scheme was originally named 'tdl:' as defined in
   draft-pstickler-tdl-00 [4].  The definition contained herein
   supercedes that previous draft.

   Examples:

      val:(http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema%23integer)15
      val:(http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema%23lang)fi
      val:(http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema%23NMTOKENS)foo%20bar%20bas
      val:(http://dodo.xyz.net/x-token)foo
      val:(voc://john.doe@widgets.org/xyzcoord)28%20191%2011
      val:(uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6)392f291a093

   These examples are provided for illustrative purposes only and do not
   necessarily constitute actual URIs.  See the BNF definition below for
   an explicit definition of 'val:' URI syntax.

   'val:' URIs are particularly useful for applications such as RDF [5]
   where one may wish to make statements about such value resources.
   E.g.  to assign language specific labels to members of an
   enumeration:

      <rdf:Description rdf:about="val:(http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema%23lang)fi">
         <rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Finnish</rdfs:label>
         <rdfs:label xml:lang="fi">Suomi</rdfs:label>
         <rdfs:label xml:lang="se">Finska</rdfs:label>
         <rdfs:label xml:lang="fr">...</rdfs:label>
      </rdf:Description>

   There is the additional benefit in RDF whereby if canonical lexical
   forms are used, every datatype value represented by a 'val:' URI in
   an RDF graph will share a common graph node, which both provides a

   considerable amount of graph compression compared to other literal
   datatyping schemes as well as facilitates queries or inference based
   on equality of datatype values.

2. BNF for the 'val:' URI Scheme

   This is a BNF-like description of the 'val:' Uniform Resource
   Identifier syntax, using the conventions of RFC 822[2], except that
   "|" is used to designate alternatives, and brackets [] are used
   around optional or repeated elements.  Briefly, literals are quoted
   with "", optional elements are enclosed in [brackets], and elements
   may be preceded with <n>* to designate n or more repetitions of the
   following element; n defaults to 0.

   This BNF description adopts sub-definitions defined in RFC 2396
   "Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax" [1] which are
   not repeated here.


   val-URI       = "val:" "(" datatypeURI ")" lexicalForm
   datatypeURI   = absoluteURI [ "%23" fragment ]
   lexicalForm   = 1*uric

   absoluteURI   = <as defined by RFC 2396>
   fragment      = <as defined by RFC 2396>
   uric          = <as defined by RFC 2396>

   Any occurrences of the characters '(', ')', or '%' in either the
   absoluteURI or fragment segments must be URI escaped.  E.g.  the
   namespace URI "foo:abc(xyz)#def%23bar" with local name "zzz" would be
   encoded as "qname:(foo:abc%28xyx%29%23def%2523bar)zzz".

   Note that the URI scheme prefix "val:" is considered to be a valid
   URI denoting this URI scheme, though it is not itself a valid URI
   according to this URI scheme.

3. Security Considerations

   This document raises no known security issues.
