1. Introduction 

  This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base 
  (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet 
  community. In particular, it defines Textual Conventions used in 
  IETF PWE3 MIBs. 
      
  This document adopts the definitions, acronyms and mechanisms
  described in [RFC3985]. Unless otherwise stated, the mechanisms of
  [RFC3985] apply and will not be re-described here.

  Comments should be made directly to the PWE3 mailing list at
  pwe3@ietf.org.
   
  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
  NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
  "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
  [RFC2119].
   
2.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology from the document describing the PWE3
   architecture [RFC3985].


3. The Internet-Standard Management Framework  

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the

   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580

7.  Security Considerations 
   
  This module does not define any management objects. Instead, it 
  defines a set of textual conventions which may be used by other 
  MPLS MIB modules to define management objects.

  Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB

11.  IANA Considerations 



Nadeau & Zelig, Ed.          Expires February 2006          [Page 10]

Internet Draft                  PW-STD-MIB                  July 2005



   
  IANA is requested to make a MIB OID assignment under the 
  transmission branch, that is, assign the pwStdMIB under  
  { transmission TBD }. 
  -- RFC Editor: Please assign TBD based on IANA-requested assignment
   
  In the future, PWE3 related standards track PW modules should be 
  rooted under the pwStdMIB subtree.  The IANA is requested to manage 
  that namespace.  New assignments can only be made via a Standards 
  Action as specified in [RFC2434]. 
   

11.1  IANA Considerations for PW-TC-STD-MIB 

  This document also requests IANA to assign { pwStdMIB 1 } to the PW 
  MIB specified in this document.
