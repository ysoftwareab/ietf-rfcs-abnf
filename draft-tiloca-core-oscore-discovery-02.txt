      Discovery of OSCORE Groups with the CoRE Resource Directory
                 draft-tiloca-core-oscore-discovery-02

Abstract

   Group communication over the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
   can be secured by means of Object Security for Constrained RESTful
   Environments (OSCORE).  At deployment time, devices may not know the
   exact OSCORE groups to join, the respective Group Manager, or other
   information required to perform the joining process.  This document
   describes how CoAP endpoints can use the CoRE Resource Directory to
   discover OSCORE groups and acquire information to join them through
   their respective Group Manager.  A same OSCORE group may protect
   multiple application groups, which are separately announced in the
   Resource Directory as sets of endpoints sharing a pool of resources.
   This approach is consistent with, but not limited to, the joining of
   OSCORE groups based on the ACE framework for Authentication and
   Authorization in constrained environments.

1.  Introduction

   A set of CoAP endpoints may share a common pool of resources, hence
   composing an application group.  All the members of an application
   group may also be members of a same security group, hence sharing a
   common set of keying material to secure group communication.

   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252] supports group
   communication over IP multicast [RFC7390] to improve efficiency and
   latency of communication and reduce bandwidth requirements.  The
   method Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE)
   [I-D.ietf-core-object-security] enables end-to-end security for CoAP
   messages through CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) [RFC8152].

Internet-Draft   OSCORE group discovery with the CoRE RD      March 2019


   In particular, [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm] specifies how OSCORE
   protects CoAP messages in group communication contexts, so enabling
   OSCORE groups as security groups.  Typically, one application group
   relies on exactly one OSCORE group, while a same OSCORE group may be
   used by multiple application groups at the same time.

   A CoAP endpoint joins an OSCORE group via the responsible Group
   Manager (GM), in order to get the necessary group keying material.
   As in [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm-oscore], the joining process can be
   based on the ACE framework for Authentication and Authorization in
   constrained environments [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz], with the joining
   endpoint and the GM as ACE Client and Resource Server, respectively.
   That is, the joining endpoint accesses the join resource associated
   to the OSCORE group of interest and exported by the GM.

   Typically, devices are equipped with a static X509 IDevID certificate
   installed at manufacturing time.  This certificate is used at
   deployment time during an enrollment process that provides the device
   with an Operational Certificate, possibly updated during the device
   lifetime.  In the presence of secure group communication for CoAP,
   such an Operational Certificate may be accompanied by information
   required to join OSCORE groups.  This especially includes a reference
   to the join resources to access at the respective GMs.

   However, it is usually impossible to provide such precise information
   to freshly deployed devices as part of their (early) Operational
   Certificate.  This can be due to a number of reasons: the OSCORE
   group(s) to join and the responsible GM(s) are generally unknown at
   manufacturing time; an OSCORE group of interest is created, or the
   responsible GM is deployed, only after the device is enrolled and
   fully operative in the network; information related to existing
   OSCORE groups or to their GMs has been changed.  This requires a
   method for CoAP endpoints to dynamically discover OSCORE groups and
   their GM, and to retrieve updated information about those groups.

   This specification describes how CoAP endpoints can use the CoRE
   Resource Directory (RD) [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory] for
   discovering an OSCORE group and retrieving the information required
   to join that group through the responsible GM.  In principle, the GM
   registers as an endpoint with the RD.  The corresponding registration
   resource includes one link for each OSCORE group under that GM,
   specifying the path to the related join resource.

   More information about the OSCORE group is stored in the target
   attributes of the respective link.  This especially includes the
   identifiers of the application groups which use that OSCORE group.
   This enables a lookup of those application groups at the Resource

Internet-Draft   OSCORE group discovery with the CoRE RD      March 2019


   Directory, where they are separately announced by a Commissioning
   Tool (see Appendix A of [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory]).

   When querying the RD for OSCORE groups, a CoAP endpoint can further
   benefit of the CoAP Observe Option [RFC7641].  This enables
   convenient notifications about the creation of new OSCORE groups or
   the updates of information concerning existing ones.  Thus, it
   facilitates the early deployment of CoAP endpoints, i.e. even before
   the GM is deployed and the OSCORE groups of interest are created.

   The approach in this document is consistent with, but not limited to,
   the joining of OSCORE groups in [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm-oscore].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This specification requires readers to be familiar with the terms and
   concepts discussed in [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory] and
   [RFC6690].  Readers should also be familiar with the terms and
   concepts discussed in [RFC7252], [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm] and
   [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm-oscore].

   Terminology for constrained environments, such as "constrained
   device" and "constrained-node network", is defined in [RFC7228].

   This document also refers to the following terminology.

   o  OSCORE group: a set of CoAP endpoints that share a same OSCORE
      Common Security Context to protect group communication as
      described in [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm].  That is, an OSCORE
      group acts as security group for all its members.

   o  Application group: a set of CoAP endpoints that share a set of
      common resources.  Application groups are announced in the RD by a
      Commissioning Tool, according to the RD-Groups usage pattern (see
      Appendix A of [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory]).  An application
      group can be associated to a single OSCORE group, while different
      application groups can rely on the same OSCORE group.  Application
      groups MAY share resources.  Any two application groups associated
      to the same OSCORE group do not share any resource.

   o  Zeroed-epoch Group ID: this refers to the Group ID of an OSCORE
      group as stored in the RD.  The structure of such a stored Group

Internet-Draft   OSCORE group discovery with the CoRE RD      March 2019


      ID is as per Appendix C of [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm], with
      the "Group Epoch" part immutable and set to zero.

2.  Registration Resource for Group Managers

   With reference to Figure 3 of [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory], a
   Group Manager (GM) registers as an endpoint with the CoRE Resource
   Directory (RD).  The registration includes the links to the join
   resources at the GM, associated to the OSCORE groups under that GM.

   In particular, each link to a join resource includes:

   o  "target": URI of the join resource at the GM.

   o  target attributes, including:

      *  Resource Type (rt) with the value "core.osc.j" defined in
         Section 7.1 of this specification.

      *  The zeroed-epoch Group ID of the OSCORE group.

      *  One target attribute for each application group associated to
         the OSCORE group, specifying the name of that application
         group.

3.  Registration of Group Manager Endpoints

   Upon deployment, a GM finds the RD as described in Section 4 of
   [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory].  After that, the GM registers as
   an endpoint with the RD, as described in Section 5.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory].

   When doing so, the GM MUST also register all the join resources it is
   exporting at that point in time, i.e. one for each of its OSCORE
   groups.

   For each registered join resource, the GM MUST specify the following
   parameters in the payload of the registration request.

   o  'rt' = "core.osc.j" (see Section 7.1).

   o  'oscore-gid', specifying the zeroed-epoch Group ID of the OSCORE
      group of interest.  This parameter MUST specify a single value.

   o  'app-gp', specifying the name(s) of the application group(s)
      associated to the OSCORE group of interest.  This parameter MAY be
      included multiple times, and each occurrence MUST specify the name

Internet-Draft   OSCORE group discovery with the CoRE RD      March 2019


      of one application group.  A same application group MUST NOT be
      specified multiple times.

   The GM SHOULD NOT use the Simple Registration approach described in
   Section 5.3.1 of [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory].

   The example below shows a GM with endpoint name "gm1" and address
   2001:db8::ab that registers with the RD.  The GM specifies the link
   to one join resource for accessing the OSCORE group with zeroed-epoch
   Group ID "feedca570000" and used by one application group with name
   "group1".

   Request: GM -> RD

   Req: POST coap://rd.example.com/rd?ep=gm1
   Content-Format: 40
   Payload:
   </join/feedca570000>;ct=41;rt="core.osc.j";
   oscore-gid="feedca570000";app-gp="group1"

   Response: RD -> GM

   Res: 2.01 Created
   Location-Path: /rd/4521

4.  Addition and Update of OSCORE Groups

   The GM is responsible to keep its registration with the RD up to date
   with links to all its join resources.  This means that the GM has to
   update the registration within its lifetime as per Section 5.4.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory], and has to change the content of
   the registration when a join resource is added/removed or if its
   target attributes have to be changed, such as in the following cases.

   o  The GM creates a new OSCORE group and starts exporting the related
      join resource.

   o  The GM dismisses an OSCORE group and stops exporting the related
      join resource.

   o  Information related to an existing OSCORE group changes, e.g. the
      list of associated application groups.

   In order to perform an update to the set of links in its
   registration, the GM can re-register with the RD and fully specify
   all links to its join resources and their target attributes in the
   payload of the POST request.

   The example below shows the same GM from Section 3 that re-registers
   with the RD.  When doing so, it specifies:

   o  The same previous join resource associated to the OSCORE group
      with zeroed-epoch Group ID "feedca570000".

   o  A second join resource associated to the OSCORE group with zeroed-
      epoch Group ID "ech0ech00000" and used by one application group,
      namely "group2".

   o  A third join resource associated to the OSCORE group with zeroed-
      epoch Group ID "abcdef120000" and used by two application groups,
      namely "group3" and "group4".

   Request: GM -> RD

   Req: POST coap://rd.example.com/rd?ep=gm1
   Content-Format: 40
   Payload:
   </join/feedca570000>;ct=41;rt="core.osc.j";
   oscore-gid="feedca570000";app-gp="group1",
   </join/ech0ech00000>;ct=41;rt="core.osc.j";
   oscore-gid="ech0ech00000";app-gp="group2",
   </join/abcdef120000>;ct=41;rt="core.osc.j";
   oscore-gid="abcdef120000";app-gp="group3";app-gp="group4"

   Response: RD -> GM

   Res: 2.04 Changed
   Location-Path: /rd/4521

   Alternatively, the GM can perform a PATCH/iPATCH [RFC8132] request to
   the RD, as per Section 5.4.3 of [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory].
   This requires semantics to be defined in future standards, in order
   to apply a link-format document as a patch to a different one.

5.  Discovery of OSCORE Groups

   A CoAP endpoint that wants to join an OSCORE group, hereafter called
   the joining node, might not have all the necessary information at
   deployment time.  Also, it might want to know about possible new
   OSCORE groups created afterwards by the respective Group Managers.

   To this end, the joining node can perform a resource lookup at the RD
   as per Section 6.1 of [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory], in order to
   retrieve the missing pieces of information needed to join the OSCORE
   group(s) of interest.  The joining node can find the RD as described
   in Section 4 of [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory].

Internet-Draft   OSCORE group discovery with the CoRE RD      March 2019


   The joining node MUST consider the following search criteria for the
   lookup filtering.

   o  'rt' = "core.osc.j" (see Section 7.1).

   The joining node MAY additionally consider the following search
   criteria for the lookup filtering, depending on the information it
   has already available.

   o  'oscore-gid', specifying the zeroed-epoch Group ID of the OSCORE
      group of interest.  This parameter MUST specify a single value.

   o  'ep', specifying the identifier of the GM as endpoint registered
      with the RD.

   o  'app-gp', specifying the name(s) of the application group(s)
      associated to the OSCORE group of interest.  This parameter MAY be
      included multiple times, and each occurrence MUST specify the name
      of one application group.  A same application group MUST NOT be
      specified multiple times.

5.1.  Discovery Example #1

   Consistently with the examples in Section 3 and Section 4, the
   example below considers a joining node that wants to join the OSCORE
   group associated to the application group "group1", but that does not
   know the zeroed-epoch Group ID of the OSCORE group, the responsible
   GM and the join resource to access.

   Request: Joining node -> RD

   Req: GET coap://rd.example.com/lookup/res?rt=core.osc.j&app-gp=group1

   Response: RD -> Joining node

   Res: 2.05 Content
   Payload:
   <coap://[2001:db8::ab]/join/feedca570000>;rt="core.osc.j";
   oscore-gid="feedca570000";app-gp="group1";
   anchor="coap://[2001:db8::ab]"

   If it does not know the multicast IP address used in "group1", the
   joining node can retrieve it by performing an endpoint lookup as
   shown below.  The following assumes that the application group
   "group1" had been previously registered as per Appendix A of
   [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory], with ff35:30:2001:db8::23 as
   associated multicast IP address.

   Payload:
   </rd/501>;ep="group1";et="core.rd-group";\
   base="coap://[ff35:30:2001:db8::23]"

5.2.  Discovery Example #2

   Consistently with the examples in Section 3 and Section 4, the
   example below considers a joining node that wants to join the OSCORE
   group with zeroed-epoch Group ID "feedca570000", but that does not
   know the responsible GM, the join resource to access, and the
   associated application groups.

   The example also shows how the joining node uses observation
   [RFC7641], in order to be notified of possible changes in the join
   resource's target attributes.  This is also useful to handle the case
   where the OSCORE group of interest has not been created yet, so that
   the joining node can receive the requested information when available
   at a later point in time.

   Request: Joining node -> RD

   Req: GET coap://rd.example.com/lookup/res?rt=osc.j&\
   oscore-gid=feedca570000
   Observe: 0

   Response: RD -> Joining node

   Res: 2.05 Content
   Observe: 24
   Payload:
   <coap://[2001:db8::ab]/join/feedca570000>;rt="osc.j";
   oscore-gid="feedca570000";app-gp="group1";
   anchor="coap://[2001:db8::ab]"

   Depending on the used search criteria, the joining node performing
   the resource lookup can get a response whose payload is quite large
   in size.  This can happen, for instance, in case the lookup request
   targets all the join resources at a specified GM, or all the join
   resources of all the registered GMs, as in the example below.

   Request: Joining node -> RD

   oscore-gid="abcdef120000";app-gp="group3";app-gp="group4";
   anchor="coap://[2001:db8::cd]"

   Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that a joining node performing a
   resource lookup to discover OSCORE groups uses observation only when
   including the fine-grained seach criterion 'oscore-gid' in its GET
   request sent to the RD.

6.  Security Considerations
