Abstract

   The SIP Telephony Device Requirements in this document are aimed to
   enable users to procure SIP phones from various vendors and install
   them using a configuration process over the network, though still
   allowing manual configuration data input if desired.  SIP telephony
   devices are also required to be updated up automatically, without the
   intervention of the end user.  The requirements are aimed to allow

Internet-Draft      SIP Telephony Device Requirements      February 2002


   service providers to support large numbers of SIP telephony devices
   from different vendors and SHOULD be used as a checklist for
   developers of SIP phones.

   SIP telephony devices may support basic telephony as well as advanced
   services such as PBX and Centrex-like telephony, third party call
   control, presence based services, roaming and other applications.
   The requirements aim to insure multi-vendor interoperability over the
   Internet and in private IP networks for such services.

   User interface and display requirements aim for consistency for
   service provider personnel and also to minimize the need for end user
   training across various SIP telephony devices.

   Other requirements specify such capabilities as the supported codecs
   for voice and video and also power feeding over the Ethernet copper
   cable.

Internet-Draft      SIP Telephony Device Requirements      February 2002


1. Introduction

   SIP telephony devices, also referred to as SIP User Agents can be any
   type of IP networked computing device optimized for SIP based IP
   communications.  SIP telephony devices can be SIP phones, PCs,
   laptops, PDAs, mobile and cordless phones that support SIP
   functionality and may support various media such as text, voice,
   video, games and possibly other Web/Internet applications besides
   real time communications.  SIP telephony devices should meet the
   requirements in this document.

   The objectives of the requirements in this document are a minimum set
   of interoperability and multi-vendor supported core features across
   the Internet, so as to enable similar ease of purchase, installation
   and operation as found for standard PCs or feature phones.  Given the
   cost of some screen phones or enterprise phones approaches the cost
   of PCs, and the larger number of phones compared to PCs, similar ease
   of use is expected by both end users and network administrators.

2. Conventions Used In This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].   The
   syntax and semantics used here extend those defined in SIP,  (RFC
   2543-bis06 [2]).  SIP is described in an augmented Backus-Naur form
   (ABNF).  See [2], section 26 for an overview of ABNF.

3. Problem Statement

   It is desirable to purchase SIP phones similar to purchasing ordinary
   phones, plug them in and have them working.  SIP phones are however
   an advanced type of specialized networked computer device and they
   need to be configured accordingly.  Also, the software and firmware
   needs to be updated from time to time.

   Other challenges come from the fact that there are expected to be
   large number of SIP devices in the network, in a mix from various
   vendors and with various model specific capabilities.  It is
   therefore desirable for service providers to manage large numbers of
   SIP telephony devices in a consistent way without stifling innovation
   by vendors who may compete with enhanced features.

   Roaming/traveling users SHOULD be able to configure any convenient
   locally available SIP telephony device (compliant with these
   requirements) by downloading their personal configuration preferences
   and data from a home network server.

Internet-Draft      SIP Telephony Device Requirements      February 2002


3.1 Classes of Requirements

   Not all SIP devices are or should be equal or need to meet all
   requirements listed in this document.  Furthermore, location or
   market specific requirements are not the object of this document.
   Regional market specific requirements for some narrowband and feature
   types of Voice over IP Telephones have been published in [3], [4].
   User interface and network specific requirements are the core of the
   SIP device requirements in this document.

4. Protocol Requirements

   SIP devices MUST support as a minimum the following protocols:

   o  Link layer protocols: Ethernet, 802.11a, 3G wireless, etc.

   o  IPv4 [5]

   o  TCP

   o  UDP

   o  DNS

   o  TFTP - optional for backward compatibility

   o  HTTP

   o  RTP and RTCP

   o  SIP

   o  SDP

   o  NTP


5. Automatic Device Configuration and Configuration Data Profile

   In any network, a SIP end system needs to establish SIP-related
   configuration parameters, namely the outbound proxy.  There are many
   possible ways this information can be configured, but manual
   configuration is ill-advised.  It is RECOMMENDED that the end system
   obtain this information via the SIP server DHCP option [7].  In this
   approach, both local registrar and proxy server are assumed to be the
   same.  In the absence of DHCP or manual configuration, a SIP end
   system has to assume that there is no outbound proxy.

Internet-Draft      SIP Telephony Device Requirements      February 2002


   Device configuration SHOULD to be fully automatic by default.  Manual
   device configuration MUST also be possible, but SHOULD be hidden for
   non-technical users.

5.1 Independence of Device, User and Service Configuration Servers

   The requirements listed here are necessary to enable network managers
   and service providers to support various SIP telephony devices using
   the same server infrastructure for all brands of SIP devices.

   Within this infrastructure, separate configuration servers MAY be
   supported, so as to have a server for each device specific
   configuration.  The URLs are likely to be different, but the server
   may be the same for different SIP device types.  Server content for
   device software can thus be maintained for example by the device
   manufacturer and other server content can be hosted by the service
   provider for user and service specific data.

5.2 Configuration for Emergency Calling

   SIP devices MUST support emergency calling either by entering an
   emergency number (such as 911 in the USA) or have a preconfigured
   universal emergency URL for "SOS" [9].  Emergency calls have to be
   routed to the preconfigured SIP server for emergency service.  The
   SIP UA may also obtain the SIP capable public safety access point
   (PSAP in the USA) or a dedicated gateway port to the PSTN for PSAP as
   part of the configuration.

   In case of manual configuration, or when automatic configuration
   cannot supply the geographic location for desktop phones, a prompt
   should be displayed for entering the geographic location required for
   emergency calls.

5.3 Configuration Processes

   The following configuration processes are required for SIP devices
   [6]:

   o  Discovery of a configuration server

   o  Enrollment with a configuration server

   o  Retrieval of configuration data

   o  Change Notifications from the configuration server

   o  Configuration Upload from the SIP device to the configuration
      server.



Sinnreich, et al.        Expires August 22, 2002                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft      SIP Telephony Device Requirements      February 2002


   The content and format of the configuration data is not specified in
   this document and can be vendor specific.  Devices from different
   vendors may use different URLs for the configuration server.

   The detailed protocol requirements for exchanging SIP configuration
   are specified in [8].

5.3.1 Discovery of the Configuration Server

   A SIP device SHOULD support all of the listed discovery mechanisms of
   the configuration server (this is different from the outgoing SIP
   proxy) in the order shown here and MUST support at least one of them.

   o  The DHCP option - least costly in terms of look-up time [7]

   o  DNS A record

   o  Manual provisioning - last resort

   SIP devices MUST support manual configuration from a web browser.

   The default IP address of the web server to configure a SIP device
   should be a de facto standard address, such as used by small office
   and home firewalls, NATs and ISDN modems.  We propose 192.168.254.1
   for SIP devices as the initial factory default value.

   The concept of a device-specific HTTP URL is very useful and MUST be
   supported.  This is different from a user URL that may move or roam.
   The device specific URL lets you address a specific device (e.g.  the
   phone in the user's office, not the phone on which the user has his/
   her personal URLs registered from).  This is very important in the
   context of edge based 3rd party call control services using REFER.

   SIP devices MUST support two or more DNS resolver entries.  If the
   first DNS server does not respond, the second DNS server MUST be
   queried.

   SIP devices must have the capability to be configured with a User
   Name for DNS entry, in  case there is no permanent IP address for the
   device or when moving the device.

5.3.2 Enrollment and Configuration Change Notification

   The enrollment of the SIP device at the configuration server and
   notifications of change from the configuration server to the SIP
   device MAY use the Event Notification in SIP [10], [11].

   o  A SIP device MAY enroll with the configuration servers using the

Internet-Draft      SIP Telephony Device Requirements      February 2002


      SUBSCRIBE request.

   o  The configuration server MAY provide the Configuration Change
      using the NOTIFY request.

   SIP devices MAY make use of the Config-Allow header field as
   specified in [2].

5.3.3 Configuration Retrieval

   The SIP device MAY retrieve its configuration profile using the URLs
   specified by the configuration server in the NOTIFY request.

5.3.4 Configuration Upload

   The configuration server should support the ability to upload a
   changed configuration profile via the same URL the SIP device used to
   retrieve the configuration profile.

5.3.5 Firmware Upgrade

   The configuration server MUST provide the URL for the HTTP server for
   firmware upgrades.

5.3.6 Example of an Automatic Configuration Process with SUBSCRIBE/
      NOTIFY.

   The target automatic configuration process SHOULD use the SIP
   SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY messages.  We refer the reader to [8] for message
   flows and example messages for an automatic configuration process
   using SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY.  This configuration method does not require
   an HTTP client and has the advantage that the server from can push
   the configuration data, without being prompted by the user.

5.3.7 Example of an Automatic Configuration Process without SUBSCRIBE/
      NOTIFY

   Existing systems processes MAY use automatic configuration without
   SIP SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY on a temporary basis.  Such systems have the
   advantage of simplicity but have the disadvantage of requiring a
   different support infrastructure and different processes for each
   brand of SIP telephony device and may thus be a bigger operational
   burden for network managers and service providers.The method without
   SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY SHOULD only be used until SIP-aware equipment is
   available.  However, this method allows using existing NAT and
   firewall equipment.An example implementation would

   1.  acquire an Internet identity via DHCP or manual setup,



Sinnreich, et al.        Expires August 22, 2002                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft      SIP Telephony Device Requirements      February 2002


   2.  load a generic configuration from a http URL that has previously
       been setup, and then

   3.  load a device specific configuration from a http URL that
       contains device specific information like its MAC address, device
       type and time zone.

   The http URL for retrieving configuration data is one of the
   configuration parameters, so that an operator may control where
   configuration data is read from.  Generic configuration contain
   settings that apply to all devices that use this URL.  This mechanism
   can be used to control the phones of a specific manufacturer in the
   realm of one operator.Device specific information can be addressed
   with additional parameters in the URL and MAY contain settings like
   SIP identities for the device.  This way, a PERL script may set up
   the required device specific information.  After plugging a phone the
   first time, the manufacturer can redirect the configuration URL to
   the operator that will control the device.  For this purpose, the
   manufacturer has to maintain a database that lists which phone has
   been shipped to which operator.

6. Codecs and Media

6.1 Media Capabilities

   SIP devices MUST support at least one of the two basic media types:
   Text for IM and/or voice for the codecs listed in these requirements.

   SIP devices MAY support other media types such as video, whiteboard,
   data applications and games depending on the device type.

   SIP phones MUST have echo control, such as specified in the ITU-T
   G.165 Recommendation [13].

6.2 DTMF RTP Payload

   SIP phones should be able to send DTMF digits as specified by RFC
   2833 [14].

6.3 Local Ringing

6.3.1 Play Single Early Media Stream

   SIP phones should play the first RTP stream and ignore any other RTP
   media streams when a "183 Session Progress" response is received.

Internet-Draft      SIP Telephony Device Requirements      February 2002


6.3.2 Use Last 18x Message Received

   SIP phones should obey the last 18x message received when multiple
   18x responses are received.  If the last response is "180 Ringing,"
   the phone should generate local ringing.  If the last response is
   "183 Session Progress," the phone should play the RTP stream.

6.4 Media and RTP/RTCP Support for Device Based Conferencing

   SIP devices MUST support audio mixing for at least two other
   conferencing participants for endpoint conference hosting in a three-
   way call.

   SIP devices that are advertised as "supporting conferencing" MUST
   support:

   1.  RTCP receiver reports for performance checking by the service
       provider or network administrator, and

   2.  Advertise the RTCP Synchronization Source Identifier to reliably
       inform all other conference participants who else is in the
       conference at any given time.  This feature MUST be disabled in
       applications such as in call centers where the supervisor "barges
       in" to monitor agent handling of customers.


6.5 Codec Support and Negotiation

   SIP devices MUST support codec negotiation using SDP to accommodate
   various codec types and MAY support several of the available codecs
   from the list shown here.

   Silence suppression MUST be configurable, depending on the
   preferences of the service provider or the end user.

6.5.1 License Free Voice Codecs

   o  G.711: SIP devices MUST support the G.711 codec with some form of
      Packet Loss Concealment (PLC) on the receiver side.

   o  GSM Codec: SIP devices SHOULD support the GSM-EFR codec for mobile
      or otherwise bandwidth limited users.

   o  ILBR Codec: SIP devices SHOULD support the emerging Internet Low
      Bit Rate Codec [12].

Internet-Draft      SIP Telephony Device Requirements      February 2002


6.5.2 Voice Codecs and License Requirements

   o  G.711: All SIP devices MUST support the license-free G.711 codec.

   Other codecs listed here MAY also be supported.

   o  G.729: G.729A codec with silence suppression and Voice Activity
      Detections (VAD) MAY be supported.  There MAY be a capability to
      turn VAD on or off via the configuration options in the server, or
      by input in the SIP device.

   o  G.723.1: SIP devices MAY support G.723.1 codecs for users with
      narrowband access.

   o  G.722: SIP devices MAY support the G.722 wideband audio codec with
      16 kHz sampling rate or the GIPS wideband codec.


6.5.3 Video Codecs

   o  H.263: SIP video devices MUST support H.263 as the default codec.

   o  H.261: H.261 codecs MAY be also supported for interoperability
      with older systems.  QCIF size images (176x144) SHOULD be
      supported.


7. Acoustic Properties

   SIP audio devices, such as used for telephony and conferencing MUST
   support:

   o  Full phone to phone duplex communications when using the handset.
      Devices having a speakerphone may implement full duplex for the
      speakerphone function depending on the price-point of the device.

   o  Echo control as specified by ITU-T G.165.

   It is the responsibility of the SIP telephony device to provide echo
   control.  SIP telephony devices MUST NOT count on echo control in IP
   telephony gateways or elsewhere in the network.

   Acoustic properties for the headset, speakerphone and related
   features such as volume control and display of volume control depend
   on the class of device and on site specific requirements.
   Requirements for acoustic properties can be the object of site
   specific attachments to the generic requirements document.

8. SIP Services Support

   SIP devices used for commercial enterprise communications SHOULD
   support the call flows for the basic and enhanced SIP services:

   1.  SIP Call Flow Examples [15]

   2.  SIP Service Examples [16]

   3.  Third Party Call Control in SIP [17]

   4.  SIP call control features [16]

   5.  SIP devices MAY support conferencing services for voice and IM
       [17], so as to be able act as host for a 3-way conference at
       least.

   6.  Presence based services [18]

   7.  Caller and called party preferences [19]

   8.  Roaming users: SIP desk devices MAY allow roaming users to upload
       their identity so as to have access to their services and
       preferences from the home SIP server.  Examples of user data to
       be available for roaming users are: User service ID, the dialing
       plan, personal directory and user preferences.

   9.  The schema for uploading the identity from a PDA is outside the
       scope of these requirements.

   The call flows for items 1.  and 2.  assure not only minimal support
   for SIP phones, as required for PSTN-style  consumer services, but
   also for the most widely used Centrex-style and PBX-style services.

   3rd party call control enables many value added services, such as
   standard control of a SIP phone from a call manager application on
   the PC collocated on the desk with the SIP phone.

9. User Interface Requirements and Settings

   Installers and network administrators: Though the setup of SIP phones
   can be completely automatic and the device settings hidden from the
   end user, the device settings when made visible to installers and
   network administrators MUST use the terminology shown here.

   End users: SIP devices MUST comply with a minimal set of end user
   interface requirements, similar to those found in mobile phones or in
   automobiles, so that end users should be able to perform basic

Internet-Draft      SIP Telephony Device Requirements      February 2002


   operations without any device specific training.

   To minimize the training required by end users and network support
   engineers, the terminology used in the display of SIP devices,
   network configuration and management MUST use the terminology in the
   list.

9.1 Address Input by User (Dialing)

9.1.1 Dialing Phone Numbers

   The phone number dialing procedure MAY be identical with the
   procedure employed for mobile phones:

   o  A "backspace" or "clear" button SHOULD allow correcting mistaken
      entries,

   o  An "enter" or "OK" button MAY initiate the call setup,

   o  Overlap dialing MAY be supported.


9.1.2 Entering URLs

   SIP devices SHOULD have a convenient way of entering URLs in the form
   of e-mail style addresses.  Suggested methods for entering URLs:

   o  URL-guessing: From call history and/or from phone book

   o  Auxiliary keyboard

   o  Handwriting and/or keyboard on touch-screen

   o  From a desktop PC, laptop or PDA

   o  Voice recognition in the device or in the network

   o  "Multitap" entry using the 12 key phone keypad, similar to mobile
      phones.  Multitap is the least desirable fallback method for
      entering URLs


9.1.3 Emergency (911) Calling

   SIP devices SHOULD support emergency (911) calling either by entering
   an emergency number such as 911 (in the USA) or with a dedicated
   button.  Emergency calls have to be routed to a preconfigured SIP
   server for emergency service.  See par.  5.2 on setting of the Public

Internet-Draft      SIP Telephony Device Requirements      February 2002


   Safety Access Point (PSAP) URL.

   The URL for emergency calls MUST use the universal emergency SIP URL

   sip:sos@domain

   in the SIP INVITE message, as specified in [8].  The SIP device MUST
   be able to make a DNS lookup to use the SIP URL for emergency
   calling.

9.2 Display and Settings for SIP Devices

9.2.1 General Behavior

   The display of the settings MAY become visible with a few keystrokes
   and SHOULD NOT be visible at all times.

   o  Language: Specifies the language.  SIP phones SHOULD display the
      local language and also MAY display the settings in English.
      Network and SIP parameters MUST be displayed exactly as they are
      used in relevant IETF documents.

   o  Date and Time: Displays the current date and time for a given time
      zone.  SIP devices SHOULD use a network time server.

   o  Phone Type: Identifies the phone as SIP Phone, SIP version,
      Manufacturer and Type.  Serial number MAY also be displayed.  The
      software version MUST also be displayed.

   o  User ID and Password: Displays the fields for user name and
      password required to access the embedded web server in the SIP
      phone.  The entered password MUST be concealed.

   o  Phone Name: Displays the name of the phone used in SIP signaling.


9.2.2 Network Settings

   o  MAC Address: The read only MAC address of the device.

   o  Configuration Server: Displays the URL for the configuration file.
      Can be HTTP (default) or TFTP.  Examples: http://
      phonesettings.isp.com/ http://settings.profispdevices.com/

   o  SIP Proxy: Displays the URL for the requests to the outgoing SIP
      server.

   o  IP Address: Displays the IP address of the device.

Internet-Draft      SIP Telephony Device Requirements      February 2002


   o  Network Mask: Displays the mask for the IP address of the device.

   o  DNS Domain: Displays the domain for DNS searching.

   o  DNS Server(s): Displays one or more DNS servers used by the SIP
      device.

   o  Update Server: Displays the URL of the server for software
      updates.

   o  DHCP: Displays if DHCP is turned "ON" or "OFF".

   o  Gateway: Displays the default router, not a VoIP gateway.

   o  Time Server(s): Displays the URL of the network time server(s).


9.2.3 SIP Settings

   o  User Real Name: This is the name displayed on the SIP phone owned
      by the user.

   o  User (remote) Display Name: This is the name that is conveyed in
      the request URL, for example sip:John.Doe@sip3.isp.com

   o  SIP Registrar Server: Displays the SIP registrar server in the
      request URI, for example in sip:John.Doe@sip3.isp.com, the
      registrar server is sip3.isp.com.

   o  Contact Preference Q: Q indicates the order of preference in a
      list of contacts.  Q can have values between 0.0 and 1.0.  The
      value Q=1.0 expresses the highest preference.

   o  Expire the Registration: The proposed expiration time for the
      registration.

   o  User SIP URL: The SIP URL associated with the sip user, not the
      device.

   o  Authentication Realm, User and Password: Displays the tuple for
      the SIP registrar and proxy authentication.  The realm depends on
      the service provider.  User name and password are provisioned on
      the SIP registrar.

   o  Outgoing SIP Proxy: Displays the URL of the SIP proxy used for
      outgoing calls.

   o  SIP retry timers T1 and T2: Should be set to 500 ms and 4,000 ms



Sinnreich, et al.        Expires August 22, 2002               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft      SIP Telephony Device Requirements      February 2002


      respectively.

   o  Trace: For devices with logging capability.  Can be set to true or
      false.

   o  Session Timer: Displays the session timer in seconds.  0 disables
      the session timer, 3,600 is the default value.

   o  SIP Refer: Displays the use of REFER.  This flag can be set to
      "true" or "false".


9.2.4 Called Party Preferences

   These parameters SHOULD reflect the features in the Internet Draft on
   Caller Preferences [19].  Feature rich SIP phones that support Called
   Party Preferences SHOULD enable the caller to instruct the outgoing
   SIP server for which URI's to proxy or redirect to, whether to fork
   or not, whether to search recursively or not and whether to search in
   parallel or sequentially.  The specific display to the user of the
   menu for caller preferences is beyond the objective of this document.

   Redirect Event: Can be "all" for redirect always, "none" for never,
   "busy" when encountering busy or "time" after the redirect timer
   times out.

9.2.5 Codec Settings

   SIP devices SHOULD display the available codecs, such as G.711,
   G.723.1, G.729, G.722, GSM, GIPS and their variants.  Though codec
   negotiation is automatic, there SHOULD be the provision to select a
   certain codec as default or on a per call basis.

9.2.6 Redirection of Fax Calls

   SIP telephony devices MAY by configured with the users preferred fax
   URL.  With this feature, incoming fax calls can be forwarded to the
   users fax machine.

9.2.7 Diagnostics

   SIP telephony devices MAY feature a log file for the most recent
   call, accessible to expert users, to determine for example why a call
   has failed.

9.2.8 Dedicated Announcement Lamps/Display Windows

   SIP devices SHOULD be provided with dedicated announcement lamps or



Sinnreich, et al.        Expires August 22, 2002               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft      SIP Telephony Device Requirements      February 2002


   announcement windows on display screens, such as for:

   o  Call Waiting indicator

   o  Message Waiting indicator

   o  Single Line Extension using Presence [9].

   Frugal SIP devices that do not have some of these announcement lamps
   and no screen, SHOULD alert users of message waiting and call waiting
   with tones or speech alerts.

10. Security

   SIP devices exposed to the public Internet SHOULD support HTTP over
   TLS [20] for device configuration messages.

   SIP phones exposed to the public Internet MUST support SIP Digest
   Authentication.

11. Network Management for SIP Telephony Devices

   Large organizations may require advanced systems to manage SIP
   devices in an efficient manner.  For this reason, at least high-end
   SIP devices such as agent workstations, executive desktop phones, and
   conference room audio/video systems MUST provide adequate network
   management support.  High-end SIP devices SHOULD support SNMP and
   standard MIBs for SIP [21] and RTP [22].

   High-end SIP devices MAY generate RTCP receiver reports for the
   network management system and make them also accessible to the end
   user of the SIP telephony device.

12. Wired and Wireless LAN Support

12.1 Wired LAN Support

   Desktop SIP telephony devices MUST support 802.3 Ethernet LAN
   connectivity and MAY support other link layers as well.

   802.3 Ethernet LAN connectivity SHOULD be manually configurable for:

   o  10 Mb/s - 100 Mb/s LAN speed

   o  Half duplex and full duplex setting at both speeds,

   o  Auto-sensing MAY be supported

Internet-Draft      SIP Telephony Device Requirements      February 2002


12.2 Wireless LAN Support

   Cordless SIP devices and PDAs MAY support wireless Ethernet 802.11b
   LANs and MAY also support emerging 802.11a wireless LANs.

   Besides the link layers listed here, SIP telephony devices MAY
   support any other wired and wireless link layers, especially those
   for existing and emerging mobile services.

13. Power for SIP Desk Phones

   SIP desk phones SHOULD be able to obtain operating electrical power
   be supplied via the Ethernet cable from the Ethernet hub or switch,
   where available [23].

   Power for all SIP desktop devices MUST be able to be powered by an AC
   power supply.  AC power supplies MAY have universal 110/220 V, 50-60
   Hz power input that requires no location specific configuration.
