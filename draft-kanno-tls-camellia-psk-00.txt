           Pre-Shared Key Cipher Suites for Camellia for TLS
                    draft-kanno-tls-camellia-psk-00

Abstract

   This document specifies new Camellia cipher suites for the Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) protocol to support authentication based on Pre-
   Shared Key (PSK).  This document realizes compatibility with RFC4297,
   RFC5487, and RFC5489 specified in AES cipher suites.

Internet-Draft     PSK Camellia Cipher Suites for TLS       January 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies new Camellia cipher suites for the Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) protocol to support authentication based on Pre-
   Shared Key (PSK).  These PSK is symmetric key, shared in advance
   among the communicating parties.  This document realizes a
   compatibility with RFC4297 [3], RFC5487 [5], and RFC5489 [4]
   specified in AES cipher suites.

   The Camellia algorithm and its properties are described in [2].

1.1.  Applicability Statement

   The cipher suites defined in this document can be negotiated,
   whatever the negotiated TLS version is.

   The cipher suites defined in Section 3 and 4 for SHA-256/384 can be
   negotiated in TLS version 1.2 or higher.

   The applicability statement in RFC4297 [3] applies to this document
   as well.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [1].

6.  Security Considerations

   For security considerations of PSK for TLS, this document refers to
   Section 7 of RFC4297 [3], Section 4 of RFC5487 [5], and Section 5 of
   RFC5489 [4].

   At the time of writing this document there are no known weak keys for
   Camellia.  And no security problem has been found on Camellia (see
   [6], [7], and [8]).
