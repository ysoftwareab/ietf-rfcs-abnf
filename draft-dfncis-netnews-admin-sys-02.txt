Abstract

   The Netnews Administration System (NAS) is a	framework to simplify
   the administration and usage	of network news	on the Internet. Data
   for the administration of newsgroups	and hierarchies	are kept in a
   distributed hierarchical database, and are available	through	a
   client-server-protocol.

   The database	is accessible by news servers and news administrators as
   well	as by news readers. News servers can update their configuration
   automatically; administrators are able to get the data manually. News
   reader programs are able to get certain information from an NAS
   server, automatically or at a user's	discretion, to provide detailed
   information about groups and	hierarchies to the user.

   NAS is usable in coexistence	with the current, established process of

   control messages; an	unwanted interference is impossible.
   Furthermore,	NAS is able to reflect the somewhat chaotic structure of
   Usenet in a hierarchical database. NAS can be used without
   modification	of existing news relay,	news server or news reader
   software, however, some tasks will be better	accomplished with NAS
   compliant software.

1.  Introduction

   The increasing number of newsgroups,	hierarchies and	articles has
   made	the administration of news servers a complex and time consuming
   task. The tools for the administration have remained	unchanged for
   nearly ten years and	are no longer appropriate. Many	hierarchies are
   inconsistent, many new newsgroups are not created or	only with a huge
   delay, removed groups keep lurking in the configuration files for a
   long	period of time.	There is no administration tool	that utilizes
   the power of	the Internet, and it is	not possible to	check the
   consistency of the news server at a given point of time.

   Users find it difficult to get an overview of the newsgroups, the
   charter of a	particular one,	which language is preferred, or	whether
   a group is moderated	or not.	Renaming, the status change from
   moderated to	unmoderated or vice versa, and the splitting of	a group
   into	several	others are dynamic processes. These processes are common
   use,	but it takes a long time until every news server is aware of
   these changes.

   An increasing number	of faked control messages has appeared in the
   last	few years. Purposely or	accidentally control messages were sent
   to foreign news servers to create or	remove a certain group,	although
   this	task was not approved by the rules of the hierarchy in question.
   Due to this fact, on	many news servers the automatic	creation is
   disabled and	several	dead groups have not been deleted. It is very
   difficult for users to determine the	status of a group, and therefore
   the propagation of articles is affected by this fact.

   It is the design goal of NAS	to provide an out-of-band system that
   helps to maintain, propagate, and deliver the required information.
   There will not be any interference with current protocols and
   standards. It is not	intended to make use of	control	messages or some
   special NNTP	commands. The advantage	of NAS is that it provides more
   information in a more structured format than	control	messages. Not
   only	news server administrators but also Usenet users can get more
   detailed information	about newsgroups and hierarchies.

   Due to the fact that	a client connects to a server, and the server
   asks	for authentication, this is a more reasonable procedure	of
   transmitting	information than control messages. Furthermore,	it is
   possible to check for changes on a regular basis at customized
   intervals to	keep local data	up-to-date.

2.  Overview

   NAS is based	on a database, which contains information belonging to
   certain groups and hierarchies. This	database is structured in a
   hierarchical	manner,	distributed to various servers and is able to
   receive queries at any time.	The service is comparable to directory
   services like DNS, LDAP or NIS. The NAS protocol is inspired	by
   protocols like NNTP and SMTP.  The port 991 is reserved for NAS and
   registered by the Internet Assigned Number Authority	(IANA) [IANA-
   PN].

   The organizational structure	of NAS is hierarchical,	that means a NAS
   root	server collects	data from the subservers that are authoritative
   for certain hierarchies. The	root server signs the data and
   distributes it authoritatively. Replication of database entries is
   possible. The hierarchical structure	can consist of multiple	levels.
   Usage of the	database is possible for news servers, news readers and
   special client programs. The	communication is based on TCP and UDP.

   Taking the real world into account, there might be some policy
   problems with a single root server. But it is possible to establish a
   structure like the current Usenet system, where some	hierarchies have
   a good administration with a	well-defined system of rules and some
   are not well	maintained. The	goal is	to get as much information as
   possible under one hat, but there can be no "official" force	to
   achieve this.

   During the startup phase it is quite	likely that there will be a root
   server, handling just hierarchies with strict rules and accepted
   authorities (like BIG8, de.*, us.*, bln.*, fr.*, it.*, etc.).

   However, it is also imaginable to have some NAS servers providing
   data	on - for example - alt.!binaries, some providing data on alt.*,
   and even some providing alt.*  following special policies or	sets of
   rules.

   An administrator using NAS will have	the choice to use just one root
   server (and all its data) and/or to use another NAS server for
   special hierarchies.

				 Figure	1


   NAS contains	information about newsgroups as	well as	complete
   hierarchies.	Furthermore, it	contains information about the
   hierarchies'	inheritable entries and	default	values for a single
   newsgroup.


3.  Protocol Level

   It is expected that the real	life use of NAS	will change the
   requirements	for the	Netnews	Administration System. On one hand the
   protocol has	to be extensible and flexible in order to implement
   improvements. On the	other hand it must ensure compatibility	between
   different versions. A simultaneous migration	of all sites using NAS
   to a	new protocol version is	not likely to happen. To solve this
   problem, NAS	has a protocol level. This protocol level describes the
   current functionality. The protocol level, being a number between 1
   and 32767, is negotiated at connection setup.  Enhancements and
   modifications must use a different protocol level than their
   predecessors. (Usually the protocol level is	incremented by 1 with
   every new version of	the protocol specification.) Every current or
   future implementation MUST be compatible with the protocol level 1,
   in order to fall back to this level if communication	on a higher
   level fails.

   An implementation of	higher protocol	levels should be able to emulate



Grau, Heinau, Schlichting				        [Page 6]

Internet Draft	     Netnews Administration System	   November 2000


   the behavior	of lower levels, even if this implies a	loss of
   features. The negotiation of	the protocol level between client and
   server is described in the specification of the command VERS. If
   there is no agreement on the	protocol level,	only commands of the
   protocol level 1 MUST be used. Documents enhancing or modifying the
   NAS standard	MUST specify from which	level these changes take place
   and how the behavior	should be in other protocol levels.

   This	document describes protocol level 1.


4.  Description	of Functions

   In order to use an NAS server, a connection must be opened by the
   client. The NAS server can be located in the	same domain or somewhere
   else	on the Internet.

   The NAS system is hierarchical. The idea is to have an NAS root
   server like the DNS root servers.  The root server distributes the
   data	collected from client NAS servers that are authoritative servers
   for their hierarchy.	 The maintenance of the	authoritative data is
   possible on any system. The root server collects the	data and makes
   them	available to other servers, which also can distribute these data
   to other servers. The administrator has the opportunity to make use
   of either all data or only parts of the database. NAS servers can ask
   multiple NAS	servers	for data. An attached time stamp provides the
   possibility to distinguish between new and old data and to avoid
   loops in the	propagation.

   To describe the NAS in greater detail, it is	necessary to emphasize
   the hierarchical design of the NAS system.  The following picture
   shows the propagation of data along the server hierarchy. There are
   two kinds of	data collection: In first place	the authoritative data
   for a newsgroup or a	hierarchy are collected, and written into a
   database. This database is made available to	a local	NAS server. The
   data	will then be collected by the upstream NAS server.

				 Figure	2

   Requests to an NAS server originating at a client as	well as	another
   server are accomplished in several steps, as	there are:  Establishing
   a connection, authentication	(optional), negotiating	a protocol level
   (optional), queries on the database,	and termination.


5.  Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"	in this
   document are	to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

6.  Specification of the NAS Protocol (TCP)

6.1.  Responses

6.1.1.	Overview


   An answer starts with a response code (a three digit	number),
   optionally followed by white	space and a textual message. Then the
   actual Text/Data follows. Text is sent as a series of successive
   lines of textual matter, each terminated with CRLF. A single	line
   containing only a single period ('.') is sent to indicate the end of
   the text (i.e. the server will send a CRLF at the end of the	last
   line	of text, a period, and another CRLF).

   Answer = Status [answertext]	CRLF
	    text CRLF
	    "."	CRLF

   If the original text	contains a period as the first character of the
   text	line, that first period	is doubled. Therefore, the client must
   examine the first character of each line received, and for those
   beginning with a period, determine either that this is the end of the
   text	or whether to collapse the doubled period to a single one.

   Example:

   <-- INFO
   --> 101 Information follows
       Server: nas.fu-berlin.de	(160.45.11.141)
       Uptime: 2 weeks,	3 days,	5 hours, 9 minutes
       Software: NAS 1.0
       Client: waran.cis.fu-berlin.de (160.45.11.136)
       Connection: 9 minutes
       Highest protocol	level supported: 1
       Requested protocol level: 1
       Protocol	level used: 1
       .


6.1.2.	Response Code Values, Structure	and Meaning

   The first digit of the response code	indicates the message type,
   i.e., information, success, warning,	error, or data:

   1xx Information
   2xx Request successful
   3xx Request successful, data	follow



Grau, Heinau, Schlichting				        [Page 9]

Internet Draft	     Netnews Administration System	   November 2000


   4xx Request accepted, but no	operation possible
   5xx Request is wrong	(syntax	error),	not implemented, or leads to an
       internal	error
   6xx Request successful, data	follow until end mark

   The second digit specifies the message category:

   x0x connection related stuff
   x1x queries,	answers, or data
   x2x server-server communication
   x3x authentication, authorization
   x8x non-standard extensions
   x9x debugging output

   The actual response code for	a specific command is listed in	the
   description of the commands.	Answers	of the type 1xx, 2xx, 4xx, and
   5xx can have	a text after the numerical code. 3xx answers contain one
   or more parameters with data; the exact format is explained in the
   description of the commands.

   An answer to	an incorrect request may be longer than	one line.


6.2.  Connection Setup

   NAS typically uses port 991,	which is reserved by IANA [IANA-PN].  If
   a connection	is set up by the client, the server answers immediately
   (without a request) with the	greeting message, which	will start with
   code	200:

   --> 200 Welcome!
       nas.fu-berlin.de	ready
       .

   If a	connection is refused because the client has no	permission
   to access the server, the answer code is 434. When the server
   is currently	out of service,	the answer code	is 404.

    Examples:

   434 You have	no permission to retrieve data.	Good bye.
   404 Maintenance time

   After sending a 404 or 434 message the connection will be closed.

Internet Draft	     Netnews Administration System	   November 2000


6.3.  Commands

6.3.1.	Structure

   A command consists of a command word, sometimes followed by a
   parameter. Parameters are separated from the	command	word by	white
   space.

   Commands used in the	NAS protocol are not case sensitive. A command
   word	or parameter may be upper case,	lower case, or any mixture of
   upper and lower case.

   The length of a command line	is not limited.

   The protocol	level described	in this	document uses command words with
   a length of exactly four characters each.

   In examples,	octets sent to the NAS server are preceded by "<-- " and
   those sent by the NAS server	by "-->	". The indicator is omitted if
   the direction of the	dialog does not	change.


6.3.2.	Overview

   The commands	described below	are defined using the Augmented	Backus-
   Naur	Form (ABNF) defined in [RFC2234]. The definitions for `ALPHA',
   `CRLF', `DIGIT', `WSP' and `VCHAR' are taken	from appendix A	of
   [RFC2234] and not repeated here.

   The following ABNF definitions comprise the set of NAS commands which
   can be sent from the	client to an NAS server.






6.3.3.	Detailed Description

   Some	overall	definitions:

   text	      =	%d1-9 /		  ; all	octets except
		%d11-12	/	  ; US-ASCII NUL, CR and LF
		%d14-255

   answertext =	WSP *(ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "-"	/ "/" /	"_" /
		    "="	/ "?" /	"!" / SP)




Grau, Heinau, Schlichting			               [Page 11]

Internet Draft	     Netnews Administration System	   November 2000


   utc-time   =	14DIGIT	 ; The date and	time of	the server in UTC
			  ; YYYYMMDDhhmmss

   Newsgroup names and hierarchy names are defined according to	the
   following ABNF definitions. Since a hierarchy name can be the same as
   a newsgroup name (e.g., hierarchy bln.announce.fub.*	and newsgroup
   name	bln.announce.fub) there	is no difference between the two.

   hierarchy-name      =  newsgroup-name ; these two are identical
   newsgroup-name      =  plain-component *("."	component)
   component	       =  plain-component / encoded-word
   encoded-word	       =  lowercase / DIGIT
		       =/ "+" /	"-" / "/" / "_"	/ "=" /	"?"
   plain-component     =  first-component-start	component-rest
   first-component-start = lowercase
   component-start     =  lowercase / digit
   lowercase	       =  %x61-7a ; letter a-z lowercase
   component-rest      =  component-start / "+"	/ "-" /	"_"

NOTE: This definition of a newsgroup name is according to
son-of-1036-draft [SON1036]. When the current draft "News Article
Format"	[USRFOR] is established	as an RFC, its definitions should be
integrated into	a higher protocol level	of NAS.

6.3.3.1.  HELP

   Description

   This	command	prints a short help text on a given command.  If called
   without parameters, it will display a complete list of commands.

   help-cmd = "HELP" [WSP commandname] CRLF

6.3.3.3.  DATE

   Description

   Prints the current time of the server in UTC	(Universal Coordinated
   Time) in the	format YYYYMMDDhhmmss, followed	by an optional comment.
   The DATE command is only for	informational use and to check the
   server time.	For regular transmission of time over the network, the
   NTP protocol	[RFC1305] should be used.

6.3.3.4.  VERS

   Description

   The VERS command is used to determine the protocol level used between
   client and server. The parameter is a protocol level	that the client
   supports and	wants to use. The server will respond with the highest
   level accepted. This	version	number MUST not	be higher than requested
   by the client. Client and server MUST only use commands from	the
   level that the server has confirmed.	It is possible,	but seldom
   necessary, to change	the protocol level during a session by client
   request (VERS [protocol level]). When no option is given, the current
   protocol level will be printed. When	no protocol level is negotiated,
   the protocol	level 1	will be	used. Commands of a higher level are not
   allowed without successful negotiation. The protocol	level can be
   followed by an optional comment.

6.3.3.6.  LIST

   Description

   To obtain a list of newsgroups and subhierarchies in	the requested
   hierarchies the command LIST	is used. The status of the hierarchies
   is also given. The highest level consists of	all top-level
   hierarchies and is labeled "*". It can be obtained this way,	too.

   The response	code 610 is followed by	white space and	the end	mark.
   The last line of the	data stream must begin with the	end mark. The
   end mark will be checked case insensitive. Comments after the
   separating white space are allowed.

   The data consist of a newsgroup- or hierarchy-name/status indicator
   pair	per line. Name and status indicator must be separated by at
   least one white space. The status indicator is one letter (see
   section 6.3.5). The interpretation is not case sensitive.

   list-cmd =  "LIST" (	WSP "*"	/ 1*(WSP hierarchy-name)) CRLF

   Possible answers

   401:	Permission denied

6.3.3.7.  LSTR

   Description

   To obtain a recursive list of newsgroups and	subhierarchies in the
   named hierarchy, the	command	LSTR is	used. The status of the
   hierarchies is also given. The highest level	consists of all	top-
   level hierarchies and is labeled "*". It can	be obtained this way,
   too.

   The use of wildmat patterns is also possible; so a "LSTR de.a*" would
   return a list of all	newsgroup starting with	de.a*.

Note: This is according	to wildmat(3) from libinn; it SHOULD be	possible
to issue requests in the style of the newsfeeds(5) pattern for newsgroup
syntax.

6.3.3.8.  HIER

   Description

   The command HIER lists all information available about the hierarchy.
   With	data header "Name" a new data block for	each hierarchy is
   started. The	header "Name" gives the	name of	the hierarchy. The data
   headers are described in section 6.3.4. The default is to transmit
   all available information. It can be	limited	to a list of desired
   headers ("Name" and "Status"	are always given). A set of comma
   separated headers, as an option to the HIER command will return the
   requested header fields.

   hier-cmd =  "HIER" [WSP range] 1*(WSP hierarchy-name) CRLF

   Description

   The GETL command is intended	for server-server communication; it will

   package is the complete information available for a hierarchy or
   newsgroup, i.e. all entries that have a value including PGP keys. The
   format of the data is the same as for the commands "HIER" and "LIST".

   The server will send	a list of ditributable hierarchy packages
   available.

6.3.3.11.  GETP

   Description

   GETP	requests the data for the hierarchy specified by the parameter
   "hierarchy-name". If	"*" is given as	hierarchy name,	all data the
   server is offering will be transmitted. The "timestamp" is the date
   and time the	package	was last obtained by the client, so the	server
   can check if	the data on the	client side is still valid or if it is
   too old. If the data	on the client side is still valid a 213	answer
   is sent, so the client knows	that his data is ok. If	the serial is
   "0",	the server is forced to	transmit the data.

Internet Draft	     Netnews Administration System	   November 2000


   The data for	a successful request are sent in ASCII armor according
   to [RFC2440], so a client has the possibility to check the signature
   or to ignore	it. The	actual data will be surrounded by an indicator
   that	specifies the signing method, the beginning mark, and the end
   mark. These specifications will be included in the signed text block.

   getp-cmd =  "GETP" WSP password WSP timestamp

   Description

   The GETA command is used for	server-server communication; it	will
   request packages that the server is authoritative for. A package is
   the authoritative data either for a newsgroup or a hierarchy. Each
   package has a serial	number attached	to control the age of the
   package.  The "timestamp" is	the date of the	last known modification
   of the package data in UTC format. A	serial of "0" indicates	that the
   package MUST	be retrieved. If the retrieving	client has a recent
   package (i.e. no modification on the	authoritative server), the
   server sends	only a 215 response.  The format of the	data is	the same
   as for the commands "HIER" and "LIST".

6.3.3.13.  Unknown Commands and	Syntax Errors

   If a	command	is recognized as unknown, it MUST be ignored. If an
   error occurs	after the command string (e.g. a missing parameter) a
   530 return code is given.



6.3.4.	Data Headers

   The following paragraphs describe keywords and key terms which
   support retrieval and storing of information.  Every	header has a
   unique English name.

   The content of a header is inheritable within a hierarchy, as long as
   the header is marked	as inheritable.	The content is the default value
   for all downstream newsgroups and subhierarchies. For example in the
   hierarchy "de", the language	header has the value "DE" (German),
   therefore this value	is "DE"	for all	newsgroups in this hierarchy,
   except those	for which explicitly define a language code of their
   own.

   Hierarchies and newsgroups must have	 at least values for the headers
   "Name" and "Status".	Unknown	hierarchies get	the status "Incomplete"
   and unknown groups get the status "Unknown".

   The header used in the NAS protocol are not case sensitive. A header
   may be upper	case, lower case, or any mixture of upper and lower
   case. It is recommended that	the first letter of the	header and the
   first letter	after a	dash are uppercase while all other characters
   are lowercase.

   Types used to mark some properties of a news	hierarchy.  It is case-
   insensitive.

   Type		    Meaning
   --------------   ---------------------------------------------------
   Global	    international, global hierarchy
		    (e.g., the hierarchies comp, de, rec)
   Regional	    regional hierarchy
		    (e.g., the hierarchies ba, bln, tor)
   Alt		    alternative	hierarchy, simpler rules for
		    creating a group, no formal	structure
		    (e.g., the hierarchy alt)
   Non-Commercial   only for personal use, commercial use is prohibited
		    (e.g., the hierarchy de)
   Commercial	    commercial use permitted (e.g., the	hierarchy biz)
   Organization	    hierarchy bound to an organization
		    (e.g., the hierarchy gnu)
   --------------   ---------------------------------------------------



6.7.  PGP Keys

   PGP keys for	Ctrl-PGP-Key and Mod-PGP-Key are transmitted in	the
   following structure:

   PGP-answer =	"V" SP Version CRLF
		"U" SP User-ID CRLF
		"B" SP Bits CRLF
		"I" SP Key-ID CRLF
		"F" SP Finger CRLF
		*("L" SP Location CRLF)
		*("K-" Keyblock	CRLF)
		"K" SP Keyblock	CRLF


   Key	 Name	     Mandatory	 Description
   ---	 ---------   ---------	 --------------------------------------
   K	 Keyblock    yes	 public	key block in ASCII armor format
				 [RFC2440]
   V	 Version     yes	 PGP-Version
   U	 User-ID     no		 key user id
   B	 Bits	     no		 number	of bits

   I	 Key-ID	     no		 key id, without leading "0x"
   F	 Finger	     no		 fingerprint
   L	 Location    no		 URL that points to the	public key
   ---	 ---------   ---------	 --------------------------------------


   A hyphen following the code indicates that the block	is continued on
   the next line. In the last message row, there MUST be white space
   after the code; this	is also	true for a single line code.

7.  Specification of the NAS Protocol (UDP)

   UDP is intended for reading programs	(news readers),	it is not in the
   scope of this document, and the use of UDP for NAS will be described
   in a	separate paper.

8.  Security Considerations

   Security issues are only vital for the server-server	communication,
   since we want a strict hierarchical model of	the netnews
   administration system. So we	want to	be sure	that only authorized
   clients connect to an authoritative server.

   Every server	has the	possibility to deny some commands or the whole
   connection based on the client's IP number.

Note: A	stronger authentication	scheme will be provided	in a higher
protocol level.
