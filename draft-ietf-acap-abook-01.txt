Abstract

     IMAP [IMAP4] allows nomadic users to access their mailstore from
     any client, but it does not support storage of personal
     addressbooks.  Application Configuration Access Protocol [ACAP]
     provides an ideal mechanism for storage of personal addressbooks.
     While ACAP permits the definition of vendor specific solutions to
     this problem, having a standard addressbook dataset class permits
     clients from different vendors to interoperably share the same
     personal addressbooks.  This specification defines a standard
     dataset class for personal addressbooks.

1.   Conventions Used in this Document

     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY"
     in this document are to be interpreted as defined in "Key words for
     use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [KEYWORDS].

     The attribute syntax specifications use the Augmented Backus-Naur
     Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [ABNF].

     When UTF-8 [UTF8] is referred to in this document, it refers to
     Unicode version 2.0, and not Unicode version 1.1.

2.   Design Issues

     Although this is not a white pages service, in order to provide
     more consistancy, this was designed to match the Common Schema for
     Internet White Pages [WHITE-SCHEMA].  It was also designed to
     minimize email client complexity, provide a clean model for
     personal distribution lists and hierarchical addressbooks and
     permit storage of vCards [VCARD] for correspondants.

     Personal addressbooks differ from white pages services because all
     the attributes and entries are controlled by the user who owns the
     addressbook rather than a directory administrator.  The user or the
     clients he uses may add new attributes at any time and some of
     these attributes are not suitable for a white pages service.

3.   ACAP Personal Addressbooks

3.1. ACAP Addressbook Dataset Class

     Datasets whose names begin with "/addressbook" are assumed to
     contain addressbook entries as defined in this specification.

3.2. ACAP Addressbook Capability

     The "addressbook.Expand.Address" and "addressbook.Expand.Complete"
     attributes require active client or server support.  The attribute
     "capability.addressbook.expand" in the "/capability/~/addressbook"
     entry is non-NIL if they are supported.

3.3. ACAP Addressbook Hierarchy

     Hierarchical addressbooks SHOULD be represented using ACAP
     hierarchy.  Any entry in an addressbook can also be a hierarchy
     node by setting the "subdataset" attribute.  This structure is used
     to represent both sub-addressbooks and mailing lists.

3.   Recommended ACAP Attributes

     The following attributes MAY be used in an ACAP addressbook entry.
     An addressbook entry MUST have an "entry" attribute, and one or
     more of "addressbook.Alias", "addressbook.CommonName" and
     "addressbook.Email" attributes.  The purpose of this rule is to
     make it possible to easily select an attribute which can be
     displayed to a user.

     An addressbook entry MUST have at most one of the attributes
     "addressbook.List", "addressbook.Reference", and
     "addressbook.Email".  The purpose of this rule is to force each
     entry to be either a regular addressbook entry with an Email
     address, a pointer to another addressbook entry, or a distribution
     list.  In order to resolve ambiguities, if there is an
     "addressbook.List" attribute, both "addressbook.Email" and
     "addressbook.Reference" attributes MUST be ignored. If there is no
     "addressbook.List" attribute but there is an "addressbook.Email"
     attribute, then the "addressbook.Reference" attribute MUST be
     ignored. Beyond these rule, clients MAY choose any subset of these
     attributes as well as using registered private attributes.  Clients
     are encouraged to provide a way to view all textual attributes in
     an entry regardless of whether the client knows the special
     semantics associated with them.

     The ABNF defines the content of the attribute values prior to their
     encoding as an ACAP string.  Clients MUST conform to the syntax
     when generating these attributes, but MUST NOT assume that the
     attribute values will conform to this syntax on access.  Servers
     MUST NOT enforce the syntax.

     Unless otherwise stated, all attributes in this specification are
     single-valued and textual.

3.1. Basic Attributes

     These attributes are defined in ACAP [ACAP] and have meaning in all
     dataset classes.  This section describes how they are used in an
     addressbook dataset.

     entry
          The "entry" attribute is a unique string used to refer to an
          addressbook entry within an addressbook dataset.  It is client
          defined and may not be suitable for display to users.

     subdataset
          The "subdataset" attribute is used both for addressbook
          hierarchy and for addressbook distribution lists.  It



Newman                                                          [Page 2]

Internet Draft       ACAP Addressbook Dataset Class        November 1997


          indicates there is another addressbook dataset underneath this
          entry.  If there is also an "addressbook.List" attribute, then
          this entry is an email distribution list and the subdataset
          contains the members of that list.  If "subdataset" exists,
          then any "addressbook.Email" or "addressbook.Reference"
          attributes SHOULD be ignored.


4.2. Naming Attributes

     These attributes contain information about the name of the person
     or entity to which the entry refers.

     addressbook.CommonName
          The "addressbook.CommonName" attribute holds the full common
          name of the person or entity to which the addressbook entry
          refers.  If a person has multiple names, they may be stored in
          the "addressbook.AlternateNames" attribute.

          abook-common-name    = 1*TEXT-UTF8-CHAR

     addressbook.GivenName
          The "addressbook.GivenName" attribute holds the given name of
          the person to which the addressbook entry refers.

          abook-given-name     = 1*TEXT-UTF8-CHAR

     addressbook.Surname
          The "addressbook.Surname" attribute holds the surname (or
          family name) of the person to which the addressbook entry
          refers.

          abook-surname        = 1*TEXT-UTF8-CHAR

     addressbook.MiddleName
          This holds the middle name(s) or initial(s) of the person to
          which the addressbook entry refers.

          abook-middle         = 1*TEXT-UTF8-CHAR

     addressbook.Prefix
          This holds any prefixes (e.g., "Mr.", "Mrs.") for the person
          to which the addressbook entry refers.

          abook-prefix         = 1*TEXT-UTF8-CHAR

     addressbook.Suffix
          This holds any suffixes (e.g., "Jr.", "M.D.") for the person



Newman                                                          [Page 3]

Internet Draft       ACAP Addressbook Dataset Class        November 1997


          to which the addressbook entry refers.

          abook-suffix         = 1*TEXT-UTF8-CHAR

     addressbook.AlternateNames
          This is a multi-value attribute containing a list of alternate
          names for the entry.

          abook-alt-name       = 1*TEXT-UTF8-CHAR
                                 ;; multi-valued

     addressbook.Alias
          A shorthand way to refer to this entry (e.g. a nickname).
          Clients MUST NOT store characters which fall into the class of
          "white-space" or "specials" as defined in Internet Message
          Format [IMAIL] with the exception of period (".").  The alias
          is typically used by clients as as a way for users to quickly
          refer to a particular addressbook entry via a type-in field.
          For this to work best, clients are encouraged to avoid using
          the same alias in multiple entries within a dataset.

          abook-alias          = 1*<"." or any TEXT-UTF8-CHAR except
                               white-space or specials as defined in [IMAIL]>

     addressbook.CommonName.MIME
          This contains the CommonName encoded as a US-ASCII string
          according to the rules in MIME Headers [MIME-HDRS].  This is
          set when a personal addressbook entry is created from an
          Internet Mail Address [IMAIL] which uses MIME Header encoding
          for the common name portion of the address.  This is the
          preferred attribute to use for the phrase portion of the
          Internet Mail Address as it preserves the sender's preferred
          character set.  Otherwise, the phrase is constructed from the
          "addressbook.CommonName" field with all non US-ASCII
          characters encoded according to MIME headers using UTF-8.
          This attribute SHOULD be NIL if the CommonName is made up of
          only US-ASCII characters or the sender's preferred character
          set is UTF-8.

          abook-mime-hdr       = phrase
                                 ;; as defined in [IMAIL]


4.3. Reference Attribute







Newman                                                          [Page 4]

Internet Draft       ACAP Addressbook Dataset Class        November 1997


     addressbook.Reference
          This addressbook entry is a reference to another ACAP
          addressbook entry, or an LDAP white pages entry.  The
          reference is in the form of a relative URL.  Clients SHOULD
          support this attribute for the local ACAP server and MAY
          support it for other ACAP or LDAP servers.

          abook-reference      = relativeURL
                                 ;; as defined in [REL-URL]
                                 ;; ACAP relative URL is defined in [ACAP]


4.4. Computer Communication Attributes

     These attributes are related to computer communication.  The format
     for email addresses MUST be canonicalized so it is suitable for use
     in both [IMAIL] and [SMTP].  This restricts the format for an
     addr-spec as follows.  This uses terminals from [IMAIL], except
     that free insertion of linear-white-space is not permitted.

     canon-addr-spec      = canon-local-part "@" domain

     canon-local-part     = quoted-string / (atom *("." atom))


     addressbook.Email
          The primary email address for contacting this entry.
          Alternate email addresses may be indicated by appending an
          appropriate qualifer to the end of the attribute name, such as
          ".work" for a work-related email address, ".personal" for a
          personal email address, or ".alt" for a multi-valued list of
          alternate email addresses of equal weight.

          abook-email          = canon-addr-spec

     addressbook.List
          If both this attribute and the "subdataset" attribute exist
          then this entry is an email distribution list.  The entries in
          the subdataset are the members of the list.  When this
          attribute exists, then any "addressbook.Email" or
          "addressbook.Reference" attributes should be ignored. If this
          attribute exists but no "subdataset" attribute exists, then
          this attribute should be ignored.

          abook-list           = "1"

Internet Draft       ACAP Addressbook Dataset Class        November 1997


     addressbook.Expand.Address
          This is an operational attribute which is present if the ACAP
          server announces the ADDRESSBOOK capability.  It's value is
          computed by the ACAP server.  The result is a CRLF-separated
          list of all the addr-spec from the addressbook.Email
          attributes of this entry, any entry referred to by
          "addressbook.Reference" on the local server, and any entries
          contained in the "subdataset" on this server.  This expansion
          is recursive.

          abook-expand-addr    = canon-addr-spec *(CRLF canon-addr-spec)

     addressbook.Expand.Complete
          This is an operational attribute which is present if the ACAP
          server announces the ADDRESSBOOK capability.  It's value is
          computed by the ACAP server.  The result is a CRLF-separated
          list of all the Internet Mail Addresses as computed from the
          addressbook.Email, addressbook.CommonName, and
          addressbook.CommonName.MIME attributes.  The entry itself, any
          entry referred to by "addressbook.Reference" on the local
          server, and any entries contained in the "subdataset" on the
          local server are expanded.  This expansion is recursive.

          abook-expand-compl   = mailbox *(CRLF mailbox)
                                 ;; mailbox defined in [IMAIL] without folding

     addressbook.RequestAddress
          If the entry refers to a mailing list address rather than a
          person, then this attribute may be used to store the address
          used to subscribe or unsubscribe from the mailing list.  If
          not present, clients should default the value to the standard
          request address defined in [MBOX-NAMES].

          abook-request        = canon-addr-spec

     addressbook.Subscribed
          If this attribute is non-NIL, then the entry refers to a
          mailing list address to which the addressbook's owner is
          currently subscribed.

          abook-subscribed     = "1"










Newman                                                          [Page 6]

Internet Draft       ACAP Addressbook Dataset Class        November 1997


     addressbook.PreferredTextFormat
          This attribute contains the media type and parameters for the
          preferred text format of for the mailbox referred to by the
          "addressbook.Email" attribute.  The syntax does not permit
          free insertion of linear white space as defined in [IMAIL].
          Values can include "text/enriched", "text/html", "text/plain",
          "multipart/alternative".  There is no defined default value,
          although clients should be aware that the only format all
          recipients support is "text/plain; charset=us-ascii".

          abook-text-format    = type "/" subtype *(";" SPACE parameter)
                                 ;; as defined in [MIME-TYPES]

     addressbook.HomePage
          This contains the URL [BASIC-URL] to the home page describing
          the person or entity to which the addressbook entry refers.

          abook-home-page      = url
                                 ;; as defined in [BASIC-URL]


4.5. Telephone Number Attributes

     Fully qualified international form is preferred for telephone
     numbers
        +1 555 555 1234 ext 54
     but as these are likely to be human-entered any form is permitted.

     The character "$" is reserved as a separator and is used to
     describe the function of the telephone number.  The following
     functions are initialially defined:

       home       This is a residence phone number
       work       This is an office phone number
       msg        This number has voice messaging support
       cell       This is a cellular telephone number
       voice      This number is a voice number
       fax        This number has fax support
       modem      This number has modem support
       pager      This is a pager number

     Thus a number such as:

        +1 555 555 1234 ext 54$office$voice$msg

     Indicates an office voice phone with voice messaging.  Additional
     functions MAY be used as long as they match the functions defined
     in vCard [VCARD].

Internet Draft       ACAP Addressbook Dataset Class        November 1997


     The formal syntax is as follows:

     abook-phone          = 1*<Any TEXT-UTF8-CHAR except "$">
                            *("$" abook-use-attribute)

     abook-use-attribute  = "home" / "work" / "msg" / "cell" / "voice" /
                            "fax" / "modem" / "pager" / abook-use-ext

     abook-use-ext        = 1*ATOM-CHAR
                            ;; as defined by vCard [VCARD]


     addressbook.TelephonePrimary
          This is the primary telephone number for the person referred
          to by the entry.

     addressbook.TelephoneOther
          This multi-valued attribute may hold additional telephone
          numbers.


4.6. Postal Address Attributes

     Postal addresses should be in the same format that they appear on
     an envelope, preferably fully qualified.  The multiple lines are
     CRLF separated within the attribute.

     addressbook.Postal
          This contains the preferred postal address for the person or
          entity referred to by the entry.  A suffix such as ".work" or
          ".home" can be added to indicate alternate addresses.

          abook-postal        = 1*TEXT-UTF8-CHAR *(CRLF *TEXT-UTF8-CHAR)


4.7. Commentary Attributes

     These are free-form text attributes used to store commentary about
     the entry.

     addressbook.Comment
          This is a freeform comment field where the owner of the
          addressbook may put comments about the person or entity
          referred to by the entry.

          abook-comment        = 1*UTF8-CHAR

6.   Mapping vCards to ACAP addressbooks

     An ACAP addressbook is a perfect place to store vCards [VCARD].  It
     provides access to business cards of your contacts from any machine
     you use regularly, complete with the ability to annotate the
     contact information.  This section describes a preliminary mapping
     from vCards.  All vCard attributes which do not have equivalents in
     this specification can be mapped directly to an
     "addressbook.<attr>" entry where <attr> is the attribute name of
     the vCard attribute converted to all lower case.

     All vCard encodings are removed and vCard newlines are replaced
     with CRLF octet sequences when converting values.

6.1. Name Attributes

     The vCard attribute "FN" maps to "addressbook.CommonName".  The
     vCard attribute "N" is divided and saved in "addressbook.Surname",
     "addressbook.GivenName", "addressbook.MiddleName",
     "addressbook.Prefix" and "addressbook.Suffix".  This division
     permits more sophisticated searching.

Internet Draft       ACAP Addressbook Dataset Class        November 1997


6.2. Telephone Attributes

     The vCard "TEL" attribute is mapped to
     "addressbook.TelephonePrimary" if the "pref" type is specified or
     there is only one, and "addressbook.TelephoneOther" otherwise.
     Other TYPE property parameters are encoded after a "$" at the end
     of the value of the telephone number as specified above to simplify
     searching.

6.3. Other Attributes

     Other attributes are mapped directly and other property parameters
     may be encoded in the attribute name if appropriate.

8.   Security Considerations

     It is important to make sure that access controls are set correctly
     on personal addressbooks.  One should be careful of sharing
     information which might contain personal comments.

     If PGP public keys are stored in a personal addressbook it would be

     integrity protection.
