             Application Enabled Open Networking Use Cases
                     draft-eckel-aeon-use-cases-00

Abstract

   This document describes application enabled open networking use
   cases.  Application enabled open networking (AEON) is a framework in
   which applications explicitly signal their flow characteristics to
   the network.  This provides network nodes with visibility of the
   application flow characteristics, which enables them to apply the
   correct flow treatment and provide feedback to applications.

1.  Introduction

   Identification and treatment of application flows are critical for
   the successful deployment and operation of applications based on a
   wide range of signaling protocols.  Historically, this functionality
   has been accomplished to the extent possible using heuristics, which
   inspect and infer flow characteristics.  Heuristics may be based on
   port ranges, IP subnetting, or deep packet inspection (DPI), e.g.
   application level gateway (ALG).  Port based solutions suffer from
   port overloading and inconsistent port usage.  IP subnetting
   solutions are error prone and result in network management hassle.
   DPI is computationally expensive and becomes a challenge with the
   wider adoption of encrypted signaling and secured traffic.  An
   additional drawback of DPI is that the resulting insights are not
   available, or need to be recomputed, at network nodes further down
   the application flow path.

   Application enabled open networking (AEON) allows applications to
   explicitly signal their flow characteristics to the network.  This
   provides network nodes with visibility of the application flow
   characteristics.  These network nodes may take action based on this
   visibility and/or contribute to the flow description.  The resulting
   flow description may be communicated as feedback from the network to
   applications.

   This document describes a set of use cases addressable by AEON.
   Additional details on the AEON are provided in
   [I-D.eckert-intarea-flow-metadata-framework]

2.  Use Cases

   The following use cases have been identified.

   1.  Traffic Prioritization: Consistent experience of video
       conferencing with competing traffic.

   2.  Firewall Traversal: Identification of new applications.

   3.  Load Balancing: Identification of application for better load
       balancing without solely relying on inspection techniques.

   4.  Scavenger class: Creation of a scavenger class.  Use metadata to
       shift high-bandwidth, low priority traffic to off-peak hours.
       TODO: That drifts from a use-case to a solution ("use metadata to
       ...").  Also, it appears to mix two things: (a) scavenger class
       and (b) time-shifting traffic.  This is confusing.

   5.  Video Adaptation: Use client metadata to help video bit rate
       selection.

   6.  Mobile Host/App Metadata: Use metadata for troubleshooting and
       network planning.

   7.  Multi-interface selection: Use metadata to help interface
       selection or prioritization.

   In describing each use case, the following information is provided.

2.2.  Firewall Traversal: Identification of new applications

2.2.1.  Description of Problem

   Modern firewalls use application-layer gateways (ALGs) to perform
   policy enforcement.  For example firewalls implement SIP-aware
   Application Layer Gateway function, which examines the SIP signaling
   and opens the appropriate pinholes for the RTP media.  In particular
   firewall extracts media transport addresses, transport protocol and
   ports from session description and creates a dynamic mapping for
   media to flow through.  This model will not work in the following
   cases:

   1.  Session signaling is end-to-end encrypted (say, using TLS).

   2.  Firewall does not understand the session signaling protocol, or
       extensions to the protocol, used by the endpoints (e.g.  WebRTC
       signaling protocols).

   3.  Session signaling and media traverse different firewalls (e.g.,
       signaling exits a network via one firewall whereas media exits a
       network via a different firewall).

   Enterprise networks that use firewalls with restrictive policies
   block new applications like WebRTC and delay deployment of killer
   applications.

2.2.2.  Proposed Solution

   The above problems can be addressed by the host getting authorization
   from the Application Server trusted by the network in order to
   install flows and associated actions (e.g., policies).  PCP third
   party authorization (draft-wing-pcp-third-party-authz-01) solves this
   problem by associating the media session with the signaling session.
   This is done by sending a cryptographic token in the signaling which
   authorizes the firewall mapping for the media session.

2.2.3.  User Benefit

   Enterprise networks that use firewalls with restrictive policies can
   deploy new applications at a faster rate for user benefit.

2.2.4.  Operator Benefit

   Enterprise firewalls can enforce restrictive policies without the
   need to be enhanced to perform ALG on new applications.  For example
   Enterprise firewall could have granular policies to permit peer-to-
   peer UDP media session only when the call is initiated using the
   selected WebRTC server (Dr. Good) it trusts and block others (Dr.
   Evil).  PCP-aware firewalls can enforce such granular security
   policies without performing ALG on the session signaling protocols.
   This mechanism can be used by any other Application Function trusted
   by the network to permit time-bound, encrypted, peer-to-peer traffic.

2.2.5.  Flow characteristics provided by application

   The client requests dynamic mappings to permit flows required by the
   application.  This request includes a cryptographic token and
   characteristics of the flow, such as the anticipated bandwidth needs
   as well as the tolerance to delay, loss, and jitter.

2.2.6.  Action taken by firewall as result of receiving flow
        characteristics

   The firewall uses the client request to permit and prioritize the
   traffic associated with those flows.  The cryptographic token
   provides authorization for the flows and their prioritization.

2.2.7.  Feedback provided by firewall

   Firewall matches the authorization data with what is requested in the
   request sent by the client.  If the authorization sets match, the
   firewall processes the request made by the client.  If the token is
   invalid or the request exceeds what is authorized by the token then
   firewall rejects the request.

2.5.  Video Adaptation: Use client metadata to help video bit rate
      selection

   HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) is an umbrella term for various HTTP-
   based streaming technologies that allow a client to adaptively switch
   between multiple bitrates, depending on current network conditions.
   HAS client first requests and receives a Manifest File, and then,
   after parsing the information in the Manifest File, proceeds with
   sequentially requesting the chunks listed in the Manifest File.

2.5.1.  Description of Problem

   The problems with HAS are:

   o  HAS client selects the initial bitrate without knowing the current
      network conditions which could cause start-up delay and frame
      freezes while a lower bitrate chunk is being retrieved.  HAS
      client does not have a mechanism to signal the flow
      characteristics and flow priority to the network.

   o  HAS server can mark the packets appropriately but setting DSCP has
      limitations.  DSCP value may not be preserved or honored over the
      Internet and OS may not allow to set DSCP values.

   o  Content Providers may have agreements with ISPs and need a
      mechanism to convey the flow characteristics and flow priority to
      the ISP.  Existing mechanisms and the associated limitations are:

      1.  ISP can be configured with the IP addresses of content
          providers to prioritize the traffic originating from those
          servers.  The limitations with this approach are ISP has to
          keep track of content providers IP addresses.  With CDNI
          (Content Delivery Network InterConnection) content could be
          served either from uCDN (upstream CDN) or any of a number of
          dCDNs (downstream CDN) and it will not be possible to manually
          track the IP addresses of all the CDN surrogates.  There is
          also no way to differentiate content which could be available
          in different bitrates.

      2.  If HAS client is behind NAT and content provider uses RESTful
          API (OneAPI) to install differentiated QoS then ISP will
          struggle to find the pre-NAT information.  Content provider
          also needs to be aware of the ISP to which the client is
          attached and the IP address of the Policy Decision Point (PDP)
          in the ISP to which it needs to signal the flow
          characteristics.

   o  ISP can use DPI to prioritize one-way video streaming content but
      is expensive and fails if the traffic is encrypted.

2.5.2.  Proposed Solution

   If ISP has agreement with content provider then HAS client can use
   third party authorization to request network resources.  At a high
   level, this authorization works by the client first obtaining a
   cryptographic token from the authorizing network element, then
   including that token in the request along with relevant flow
   characteristics.  ISP validates the token and grants the request.

2.5.3.  User Benefit

   AEON helps increase the average play quality, reduces the start-up
   delay and frame freezes by avoiding attempt to retrieve a too high-
   bit rate chunk etc thus improving the quality of experience for end
   user.

2.5.4.  Operator Benefit

   Network Operators can recognize and prioritize one-way video
   streaming content.

2.5.5.  Flow characteristics provided by application

   HAS client signals the flow characteristics such as the anticipated
   bandwidth needs as well as the tolerance to delay, loss, and jitter.

2.5.6.  Action taken by network as result of receiving flow
        characteristics

   Subject to local policies, a network node might perform bandwidth
   counting, or reconfigure the underlying network so that additional
   bandwidth is made available for this particular flow, or might
   perform other actions.

2.5.7.  Feedback provided by network

   The network responds that the client request can be fully or
   partially accommodated.  It also notifies the client when conditions
   change.

2.7.  Multi-interface selection: Use metadata to help interface
      selection or prioritization

2.7.1.  Description of Problem

   An increasing number of hosts are operating in multiple-interface
   environments and a host with multiple interfaces needs to choose the
   best interface for communication.  Oftentimes, this decision is based
   on a static configuration and does not consider the link
   characteristics of that interface, which may affect the user
   experience.  The network interfaces may have different link
   characteristics, but that will not be known without the awareness of
   the upstream and downstream characteristics of the access link.

2.7.2.  Proposed Solution

   TODO

2.7.3.  User Benefit

   Applications can choose the best interface for communication using
   AEON.

2.7.4.  Operator Benefit

   The network that can provide the requested flow characteristics will
   be selected by the application thus increasing the subscriber base of
   the operator.

2.7.5.  Flow characteristics provided by application

   Application signals flow characteristics over multiple interfaces and
   based on the response from its various interfaces sorts the source
   addresses according to the link capacity characteristics.  Source
   addresses from the interface which best fulfills the desired flow
   characteristics are assigned the highest priority and would be tried
   first to communicate with the server or remote peer.  For example
   draft-reddy-mmusic-ice-best-interface-pcp-00 explains the mechanism
   where Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) agent on a host
   with multiple interfaces uses AEON to determine the link
   characteristics of the host's interfaces, which influences the ICE
   candidate priority.  Similarly draft-wing-mptcp-pcp-00 explains how
   Multipath TCP (MPTCP) can select the best path when multiple paths
   are available.
