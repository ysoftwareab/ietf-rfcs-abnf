Abstract

   Full internationalization of electronic mail requires not only the
   capability to transmit non-ASCII content, to encode selected
   information in specific header fields, and to use non-ASCII
   characters in envelope addresses.  It also requires being able to
   express those addresses and information based on them in mail header
   fields.  This document specifies an experimental variant of Internet
   mail that permits the use of Unicode encoded in UTF-8, rather than
   ASCII, as the base form for Internet email header field bodies.  This
   form is permitted in transmission only if authorized by an SMTP

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Role of this specification

   Full internationalization of electronic mail requires several
   capabilities:

   o  The capability to transmit non-ASCII content, provided for as part
      of the basic MIME specification [RFC2045], [RFC2046].
   o  The capability to express those addresses, and information related
      to and based on them, in mail header fields, defined in this
      document.And, finally,
   o  The capability to use international characters in envelope
      addresses, discussed in [EAI-overview] and specified in
      [EAI-SMTP-extension].

   This document specifies an experimental variant of Internet mail that
   permitsthe use of Unicode encoded in UTF-8 [RFC3629], rather than
   ASCII, as the base form for Internet email header fields.  This form
   is permitted in transmission, if authorized by the SMTP extension
   specified in [EAI-SMTP-extension] or by other transport mechanisms
   capable of processing it.


2.  Background and History

   Mailbox names often represent the names of human users.  Many of
   these users throughout the world have names that are not normally
   expressed with just the ASCII repertoire of characters, and would
   more or less like to use their real names in their mailbox names.
   These users are also likely to use non-ASCII text in their common
   names and subjects of email messages, both in what they send and what
   they receive.  This protocol specifies UTF-8 as the encoding to
   represent email header field bodies.

   The traditional format of email messages [RFC2822] allows only ASCII
   characters in the header fields of messages.  This prevents users
   from having email addresses that contain non-ASCII characters.  It
   further forces non-ASCII text in common names, comments, and in free
   text (such as in the Subject: field) to be encoded (as required by
   MIME format [RFC2047]).This specification describes a change to the
   email message format that is related to the SMTP message transport
   change described in the associated document [EAI-overview] and
   [EAI-SMTP-extension], and that allows non-ASCII characters most email
   header fields.  These changes affect SMTP clients, SMTP servers, mail
   user agents (MUAs), list expanders, gateways to other media, and all
   other processes that parse or handle email messages.

Internet-Draft             I18N Email Headers                 April 2007


   As specified in [EAI-SMTP-extension], an SMTP protocol extension
   "UTF8SMTP" is used to prevent the transmission of messages with UTF-8
   header fields to systems that cannot handle such messages.

   Use of this SMTP extension helps prevents the introduction of such
   messages into message stores that might misinterpret, improperly
   display, or mangle such messages.  It should be noted that using an
   ESMTP extension does not prevent to transfer email messages with
   UTF-8 header fields to other systems that use the email format for
   messages and that may not be upgraded, such as the POP and IMAP
   servers.  Those protocols also need to be changed in order to handle
   stored messages that have UTF-8 header fields.

   The objective for this protocol is to allow UTF-8 in email header
   fields.  Issues about how to handle messages that contain UTF-8
   header fields but are proposed to be delivered to systems that have
   not been upgraded to support this capability are discussed elsewhere,
   particularly in [EAI-downgrading].


3.  Terminology

   In this document, even ordinarg ASCII characters are UTF-8 characters
   if the bodies of those headers contain <utf8-xtra-char>s.

   Unless otherwise noted, all terms used here are defined in [RFC2821]
   or [RFC2822] or in [EAI-overview].

   The key words "MUST", "SHALL", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "RECOMMENDED",
   and "MAY" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   https://www1.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ima for information about
   subscribing.  The list's archive is at
   http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ima/index.html.


4.  Changes on Message Header Fields

   SMTP clients can send header fields in UTF-8 format, if the UTF8SMTP
   extension is advertised by the SMTP server or as permitted by other
   transport mechanisms.

   This protocol does NOT change the definition of header field names.
   That is, only the bodies of header fields are allowed to have UTF-8
   characters; the rules in [RFC2822] for header names are not changed.
   To permit UTF-8 characters in field values, the header definition in

Internet-Draft             I18N Email Headers                 April 2007


   [RFC2822] must be extended to support new format.  The following ABNF
   is defined to substitute those definition in [RFC2822].

   Those syntax rules not referred to this section remain as the
   original definition in [RFC2822].

4.1.  UTF8 Syntax

   UTF-8 characters can be defined in terms of octets using the
   following ABNF, taken from [RFC3629]:"

   UTF8-xtra-char  =   UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4

   UTF8-2          =   %xC2-DF UTF8-tail

   UTF8-3          =   %xE0 %xA0-BF UTF8-tail /
                       %xE1-EC 2(UTF8-tail) /
                       %xED %x80-9F UTF8-tail /
                       %xEE-EF 2(UTF8-tail)

   UTF8-4          =   %xF0 %x90-BF 2(UTF8-tail) /
                       %xF1-F7 3(UTF8-tail)

   UTF8-tail       =   %x80-BF

   These are taken from [RFC3629], but kept in this document for reasons
   of convenience.
   [Note in draft: Whether normalizing is needed or not will be place in
   here.]

4.2.  Changes on MIME headers

   The syntax of <value>, as defined in [RFC2045] is

   value   =       token / utf8-quoted-string

   To be able to use UTF-8 characters in MIME headers, <quoted-string>
   syntax is extended as

   qcontent = utf8-qtext / utf8-quoted-pair

   In all those header fields, Observe that such Content-Type and other
   header fields may be found both amongst the top-level fields of a
   message and also within multiparts; and also that a complete message
   conforming to this document may now appear as a message/rfc822 (in
   both cases, subject to downgrade when that is necessary)

Internet-Draft             I18N Email Headers                 April 2007


4.3.  Syntax extensions to RFC 2822

   The following rules are intended to extend the corresponding rules in
   [RFC2822] to allow UTF8 characters.

   ctext   /=  NO-WS-CTL /     ; all of <text> except
              %d33-39 /       ; SP, HTAB, "(", ")"
              %d42-91 /       ; and "\"
              %d93-126 /
              UTF8-xtra-char

   utext   =  NO-WS-CTL /     ; Non white space controls
              %d33-126 /      ; The rest of US-ASCII
              UTF8-xtra-char

   comment = "(" *([FWS] utf8-ccontent) [FWS] ")"

   word    = utf8-atom / utf8-quoted-string

   This means that all the [RFC2822] constructs that build upon these
   will permit UTF-8 characters, including comments and quoted strings.
   Besides, in order to allow UTF8 characters in <addr-spec> we have to
   change the syntax of <atext>.  However, it would also lead <msg-id>
   to allow UTF8 characters, which is not allowed due to the limitation
   described in Section 4.5.  So <utf8-atext> is added to meet this
   requirement.

   utf8-text   =  %d1-9 /         ; all UTF-8 characters except
              %d11-12 /       ; US-ASCII NUL, CR and LF
              %d14-127 /
              UTF8-xtra-char

   utf8-quoted-pair   = ("\" utf8-text) / obs-qp

              %d35-91 /        ; characters not including "\"
              %d93-126 /       ; or the quote character


   utf8-atext   =  ALPHA / DIGIT /
                   "!" / "#" /     ; Any character except
                   "$" / "%" /     ; controls, SP, and specials.
                   "&" / "'" /     ; Used for atoms
                   "*" / "+" /
                   "-" / "/" /
                   "=" / "?" /
                   "^" / "_" /
                   "`" / "{" /
                   "|" / "}" /
                   "~" /
                   UTF8-xtra-char

   utf8-atom     = [CFWS] 1*utf8-atext [CFWS]

   utf8-dot-atom = [CFWS] utf8-dot-atom-text [CFWS]

   utf8-dot-atom-text = 1*utf8-atext *("." 1*utf8-atext)

   [NOTE IN DRAFT: If any header needs to be restricted to disallow
   this, please raise the issue on the mailing list.]
   Note, however, this does not remove any constraint on the character
   set of protocol elements; for instance, all the allowed values for
   timezone in the Date: headers are still expressed in ASCII.  And
   also, none of this revised syntax affects what is allowed in a
   <message-id>, which will still remain in pure ASCII.

4.4.  Change on addr-spec syntax

   Internationalized email addresses are represented in UTF-8.  Thus,
   all header fields containing <mailbox>es are updated to permit UTF-8
   as well as an additional, optional all-ascii alternate address.  Note
   that MSAs and MTAs may need to downgrade internationalized messages.
   The procedure for doing so in described in [EAI-downgrading].

   mailbox        =  name-addr / addr-spec / utf8-addr-spec
   angle-addr = [CFWS] "<" utf8-addr-spec<alt-address>">" [CFWS] / \
                [CFWS] "<" utf8-addr-spec ">" [CFWS] / \
                            [CFWS] utf8-addr-spec [CFWS]
   utf8-addr-spec =  utf8-local-part "@" utf8-domain

   utf8-local-part=  utf8-dot-atom / utf8-quoted-string / obs-local-part

   utf8-domain    =  utf8-dot-atom / domain-literal / obs-domain

   alt-address    =  [CFWS] "<" addr-spec ">" [CFWS]

   Below list a few possible <mailbox> representation as example.


      "DISPLAY_NAME" <ASCII@ASCII>
         ; traditional mailbox format

      "DISPLAY_NAME" <non-ASCII@non-ASCII>
         ; UTF8SMTP but no ALT-ADDRESS parameter provided,
         ; message will bounce if UTF8SMTP extension is not supported

      non-ASCII@non-ASCII
             ; without DISPLAY_NAME and quoted string
             ; UTF8SMTP but no ALT-ADDRESS parameter provided,
         ; message will bounce if UTF8SMTP extension is not supported

      "DISPLAY_NAME" <non-ASCII@non-ASCII<ASCII@ASCII>>
         ; UTF8SMTP with ALT-ADDRESS parameter provided,
         ; ALT-ADDRESS can be used if downgrade is necessary

4.5.  Trace field syntax

   "For" fields containing internationalized addresses are allowed, by
   use of the new uFor syntax.  UTF-8 information in needed in Received
   fields and such information is therefore allowed, to preserve the
   integrity of those fields.  The uFor syntax retains the original
   UTF-8 email address between EAI-aware MTAs.  Note that, should
   downgrading be required, the uFor parameter is dropped per the
   procedure specified in [EAI-downgrading].

Internet-Draft             I18N Email Headers                 April 2007


   The "Return-Path" header provides the email returning address in the
   mail delivery.  Thus, it MUST able to carry UTF8 addresses (see the
   revised syntax of <angle-addr> in Section 4.3 of this document).
   This will not break the rule of trace fied integrity, because it is
   added at the last MTA.

4.6.  UTF8SMTP message

   Certain messages must be transmitted only if SMTP extension specified
   in [EAI-SMTP-extension] is supported or otherwise environment
   supports these messages.  These messages are called to UTF8SMTP
   messages.  Message is "UTF8SMTP message", if * it uses UTF-8 header
   as specified on this document on header of message, or * it uses
   UTF-8 header on MIME header blocks on body of message, or * it
   contains a message/rfc822 which is itself a UTF8SMTP message, or * it
   includes MIME parts with new MIME subtypes that are, by their
   definitions, only permitted in UTF8SMTP messages.

   the object defined in [EAI-dsn] is intended to be transportable as
   part of an ordinary [RFC2822] message.  This means that if message
   includes UTF8SMTP messages, with are carried on MIME subtypes of
   "message", message itself is UTF8SMTP messages.  And media type for
   UTF8SMTP message is defined on [EAI-dsn].


5.  Additional issues

   This section identifies issues that are not covered as part of this
   set of specifications, but that will need to be considered as part of
   UTF8SMTP deployment.

   This document does not specify any requirement for normalization.
   Prudent use of UTF-8 in identifiers will involve sharply restricted
   forms, for instance case-folded NFKC, but this document does not
   require such a form anywhere in the protocol.  [Note in draft:
   Whether this non-requirement is adequate is a subject for debate].

5.1.  Mailing list header fields

   All mailing list and mail redistribution related header are discussed
   in [EAI-mailing-list].


6.  Security Considerations

   If a user has a non-ASCII mailbox address and an ASCII mailbox
   address, a digital certificate that identifies that user may have
   both addresses in the identity.  Having multiple email addresses as

Internet-Draft             I18N Email Headers                 April 2007


   identities in a single certificate is already supported in PKIX and
   OpenPGP.

   Because UTF-8 often requires several octets to encode a single
   character, internationalized local parts may cause mail addresses to
   become longer.  As specified in [RFC2822], each line of characters
   MUST be no more 998 octets, excluding the CRLF.

   In this specification, a user could provide an ASCII alternative
   address for a non-ASCII address.  However, it is possible these two
   address go to different mailbox, or even different persons.  This
   might not be a protocol problem, but the user's personal choice or
   administration policy or even be a deliberate attempt to deceive or
   cause confusion.


7.  IANA considerations

   There are no IANA considerations in this document.
