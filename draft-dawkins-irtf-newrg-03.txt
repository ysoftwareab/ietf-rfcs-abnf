1.  Introduction and Scope

   This document provides a high-level description of things for
   Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) participants to consider when
   bringing proposals for new research groups into the Internet Research
   Task Force (IRTF).  This document emphasizes differences in
   expectations between the two organizations.

   IRTF research group guidelines and procedures are described in
   [RFC2014] (BCP 8), and this document does not change those guidelines
   and procedures in any way.

2.  The IRTF is not the IETF

   A number of proposals from experienced IETF participants for new IRTF
   research groups have encountered problems because the IETF
   participants were making proposals appropriate for the IETF, but not
   for the IRTF.  [RFC2014] describes the origin of IRTF research
   groups, but doesn't provide much detail about the process, which is
   intended to be flexible and accommodate new types of research groups.
   Lacking that detail, experienced IETF participants fall back on what
   they know, assume that chartering an IRTF research group will be
   similar to chartering an IETF working group, and follow the
   suggestions in [RFC6771] to gather a group of interested parties, and
   then follow the suggestions in [RFC5434] to prepare for a successful
   BOF and eventually, a chartered working group.

   Both of these documents are excellent references for proposals in the
   IETF, but their suggestions may result in a proposal that is almost
   the opposite of what the IRTF Chair is looking for in a proposal for
   an IRTF research group.  The mismatches fall into some consistent
   categories, and this document lists the ones that come up repeatedly.

   Researchers aren't likely to fall into this trap, so the target
   audience of this document is IETF participants.

   It's worth noting that the IRTF Chair has substantial autonomy on
   what research groups are chartered and how they reach that stage.
   This document reflects Lars Eggert as IRTF Chair.  If future chairs
   do things differently, revising this document would be a good plan.

2.1.  Research and Engineering

      "To me, the fundamental outcome of research is understanding, and
      the fundamental outcome of engineering is a product" - Fred Baker.

   In some ways, research is about a journey, and engineering is about a
   destination.  If a researcher answers a question in a way that opens
   another question, that can be success.  If an engineer keeps working
   on a product without finishing it, that is usually a failure.

   Research can be open-ended, while engineering can come to a stopping
   point when the result is "good enough" - good enough to ship.

      "If it has to work when you're finished, it wasn't research, it
      was engineering" - attributed to Dave Clark.

2.2.  Research Community Alternatives

   IRTF research groups are only one of several alternatives available
   to researchers.  Where there are already well-established relevant
   workshops and conferences, researchers might be less motivated to
   also participate in an IRTF research group.

   Starting an IRTF research group may still be the right thing to do,
   but will be more likely to succeed in attracting a stable community
   of researchers if it offers a venue that complements what's already
   available.  This isn't a requirement, but it is an opportunity for
   creative thinking.

   "Complementing" may take many different forms, reflecting the
   flexibility IRTF research groups have in organizing their work.  For
   instance, some IRTF research groups focus on applying theories that
   have been developed elsewhere to the Internet, while others focus on

   bringing researchers and engineers together, and in particular to
   "build bridges" between the practitioners and the theorists.

2.3.  Scope

   IRTF research groups have a scope large enough to interest
   researchers, attract them to the IRTF, and keep them busy doing
   significant work.  Their charters are therefore usually much broader
   than IETF working group charters, and research groups often discuss
   different topics underneath the charter umbrella at different times,
   based on current research interests in the field.

   IETF working groups are chartered with a limited scope and specific
   deliverables.  If deliverables and milestones are known, the proposal
   is likely too limited for the IRTF.

2.4.  Timeframes

   IRTF research groups bring researchers together to work on
   significant problems.  That takes time.  The effort required by a
   research group is likely to take at least three to five years,
   significantly longer than IETF working groups envision when they are
   chartered.

2.5.  Alternatives

   IRTF research groups are encouraged to explore more than one
   alternative approach to the chartered problem area.  There is no
   expectation that the research group will "come to consensus" on one
   approach.  The research group may publish multiple competing
   proposals as research produces results.

   Because IETF working groups focus on immediate needs, the emphasis is
   often on picking one approach, whether that means starting with an
   approach the working group participants agree on, or considering
   alternatives with a view to picking one before spending significant
   effort on alternatives that won't go forward.

   The IRTF as an organization may also charter multiple research groups
   with somewhat overlapping areas of interest, which the IETF tries
   very hard to avoid.

2.6.  Process

   All IRTF participants have the obligation to disclose IPR and
   otherwise follow the IRTF's IPR policies, which closely mirror the
   IETF's IPR policies, but in all other aspects, IRTF research group
   operation is much less constrained than IETF working group operation.

Internet-Draft            IRTF Primer for IETF                 July 2014


   Each IRTF research group is permitted (and encouraged) to agree on a
   way of working together that best supports the specific needs of the
   group.  This freedom allows IRTF research groups to bypass
   fundamental IETF ways of working, such as the need to reach at least
   rough consensus, which IRTF research groups need not do.  The mode of
   operation of IRTF research groups can therefore also change over
   time, for example, becoming more like IETF working group operation as
   the research the group has been progressing matures and nears
   potential standardization in the IETF.

2.7.  Charters

   The purpose of charters in the IRTF is to broadly sketch the field of
   research that a group is interested in pursuing, and to serve as an
   advertisement to other researchers who may be wondering if the group
   is the right place to participate.

   IETF working group charters tend to be very narrow, intended to
   constrain the work that the working group will be doing, and may
   contain considerable text about what the working group will not be
   working on.

2.8.  Deliverables

   There is no expectation that IRTF groups must publish any RFCs,
   although many occasionally do.  Some IRTF research groups produce
   IRTF-stream RFCs, while others produce Internet-Drafts that form the
   basis of IETF-stream RFCs, and still others may deliver reports,
   white papers, academic journal articles, or even carry out relevant
   high-level discussions that aren't ever published, but influence
   other research.  IRTF groups are successful when they stimulate
   discussion, produce relevant outputs and impact the research
   community.

   IETF working group deliverables tend to be specific protocol,
   deployment and operational specifications, along with problem
   statements, use cases, requirements and architectures that inform
   those specifications.

2.9.  Completion

   When IRTF research groups have produced the appropriate outputs,
   researchers may consider what they've learned from producing those
   outputs, and look for better solutions.

   IETF working groups will typically conclude when they meet their
   chartered milestones, allowing participants to focus on

   implementation and deployment, although the working group mailing
   list may remain open for a time.

3.  Now That You Know What Not To DO

   The current IRTF Chair, Lars Eggert, is fond of saying, "just act
   like an IRTF research group for a year, and we'll see if you are
   one".

   There are many ways to "act like an IRTF research group".  [RFC4440]
   contains a number of points to consider when proposing a new research
   group.  Beyond that - just e-mail the IRTF Chair and start the
   conversation.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document provides guidance about the IRTF chartering process to
   IETF participants and has no direct Internet security implications.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requests of IANA and the RFC Editor can safely
   remove this section during publication.

6.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks go to Lars Eggert, who became IRTF Chair in 2011 and has been
   carrying this information around in his head ever since.  Lars also
   provided helpful comments on early versions of this document.

   Thanks especially to Fred Baker for sharing thoughts about the
   motivations of research and engineering that resulted in a complete
   rewrite of Section 2.1.

   Thanks also to Scott Brim, David Meyer, and Stephen Farrell for
   helpful review comments, and to Denis Ovsienko for careful
   proofreading.
