Abstract

   This document gives the IESG's procedures for handling documents
   submitted for RFC publication via the RFC Editor, subsequent to the
   changes proposed by the IESG at the Seoul IETF, March 2004.

   NOTE IN DRAFT: These guidelines are proposed, not adopted. Comments
   are welcome - please send them to iesg@ietf.org.

1. Introduction and history

   There are a number of different methods by which an RFC is published,
   some of which include review in the Internet Engineering Task Force

   (IETF), and some of which include approval by the Internet
   Engineering Steering Group (IESG):
   o  IETF Working Group to Standards Track: Includes WG consensus,
      review in the IETF, IETF Last Call and IESG approval
   o  IETF Working Group to Experimental/Informational: Includes WG
      consensus, review in the IETF and IESG approval
   o  AD Sponsored to Standards Track: Includes review in the IETF, IETF
      Last Call and IESG approval
   o  AD Sponsored Individual to Experimental/Informational: Includes
      some form of review in the IETF and IESG approval
   o  Documents for which special rules exist, including IAB documents
      and April 1st RFCs, and republication of documents from other SDOs
      - the IESG and the RFC Editor keep a running dialogue on which
      documents these are
   o  RFC Editor documents to Experimental/Informational
   This memo is concerned with the IESG processing of the last category
   only.

   For the last few years, the IESG has reviewed all documents submitted
   by individuals to the RFC Editor for RFC publication ("RFC Editor
   documents") before publication. In 2003, this review was often a full
   scale review of technical content, with the ADs attempting to clear
   points with the authors, stimulate revisions of the documents,
   encourage the authors to contact appropriate working groups and so
   on. This was a considerable drain on the resources of the IESG, and
   since this is not the highest priority task the IESG members do, it
   often resulted in significant delays.

   In March 2004, the IESG decided to make a major change in this review
   model. The new review model will have the IESG take responsibility
   ONLY for checking for conflicts between the work of the IETF and the
   documents submitted; soliciting technical review is deemed to be the
   responsibility of the RFC Editor. If an individual IESG member
   chooses to review the technical content of the document, and finds
   issues, that member will communicate these issues to the RFC Editor,
   where they will be treated the same way as comments on the documents
   from other sources.

2. Background material

   The review of independent submissions by the IESG was prescribed by
   RFC 2026 [1] section 4.2.3. The procedure described in this document
   is compatible with that description.

   RFC 3710 [3] section 5.2.2 describes the spring 2003 review process;
   with the publication of this document, the procedure described in RFC
   3710 is no longer relevant to documents submitted via the RFC Editor.

3. Detailed description of IESG review

   The IESG will review all documents submitted through the RFC Editor
   for conflicts with the IETF standards process or work done in the
   IETF community. The review is initiated by a note from the RFC Editor
   specifying the draft name, the RFC Editor's belief about the
   document's present suitability for publication, and (if possible) the
   list of people who have reviewed the document for the RFC Editor.

   The IESG may return five different responses, all of which may be
   accompanied by an IESG note to be put on the document if the RFC
   Editor wishes to publish.

   1.  The IESG has not found any conflict between this document and
       IETF work.
   2.  The IESG thinks that this work is related to IETF work done in WG
       <X>, but this does not prevent publishing.
   3.  The IESG thinks that publication is harmful to the IETF work done
       in WG <X>, and recommends not publishing the document at this
       time.
   4.  The IESG thinks that this document violates IETF procedures for
       <X>, and should therefore not be published without IETF review.
   5.  The IESG thinks that this document extends an IETF protocol in a
       way that requires IETF review, and should therefore not be
       published without IETF review.

   The last two cases are included for the case where a document
   attempts to do things (such as URI scheme definition) that require
   IETF consensus or IESG approval (as these terms are defined in RFC
   2434 [2]), and the case where an IETF protocol is proposed to be
   changed or extended in an unanticipated way that may be harmful to
   the normal usage of the protocol, but where the protocol documents do
   not explicitly say that this type of extension requires IETF review.

   In the case of a document requiring IETF review, the IESG will offer
   the author the opportunity to ask for publication as an AD-sponsored
   individual document, which is subject to full IESG review including
   possible assignment to a WG or rejection. Redirection to the full
   IESG review path is not a guarantee that the IESG will accept the
   work item, or even that the IESG will give it any particular
   priority; it is a guarantee that the IESG will consider the document.

   The IESG will normally have review done within 4 weeks from the RFC
   Editor's notification. In the case of a possible conflict, the IESG
   may contact a WG or a WG chair for an outside opinion of whether
   publishing the document is harmful to the work of the WG, and in the
   case of a possible conflict with an IANA registration procedure, the
   IESG may contact the IANA expert for that registry.

   Note that judging the technical merits of submissions, including
   considerations of possible harm to the Internet, will become solely
   the responsbility of the RFC Editor. The IESG assumes that the RFC
   Editor will manage its own mechanisms for additional technical
   review.

4. Standard IESG note

   One of the following IESG notes will be sent to the RFC Editor for
   all documents for placement either in or immediately following the
   "Status of this Memo" section of the finished RFC, unless the IESG
   decides otherwise:
   1.  For documents that specify a protocol or other technology, and
       that have been considered in the IETF at one time:

       The content of this RFC was at one time considered by the IETF,
       and therefore it may resemble a current IETF work in progress or
       a published IETF work. This RFC is not a candidate for any level
       of Internet Standard. The IETF disclaims any knowledge of the
       fitness of this RFC for any purpose, and in particular notes that
       it has not had IETF review for such things as security,
       congestion control or inappropriate interaction with deployed
       protocols.  The RFC Editor has chosen to publish this document at
       its discretion. Readers of this RFC should exercise caution in
       evaluating its value for implementation and deployment. See RFC
       XXXX for more information.
   2.  For documents that specify a protocol or similar technology, and
       are independent of the IETF process:

       This RFC is not a candidate for any level of Internet Standard.
       The IETF disclaims any knowledge of the fitness of this RFC for
       any purpose, and in particular notes that it has not had IETF
       review for such things as security, congestion control or
       inappropriate interaction with deployed protocols.  The RFC
       Editor has chosen to publish this document at its discretion.
       Readers of this document should exercise caution in evaluating
       its value for implementation and deployment. See RFC XXXX for
       more information.
   3.  For documents that do not specify a protocol or similar
       technology:

       This RFC is not a candidate for any level of Internet Standard.
       The IETF disclaims any knowledge of the fitness of this RFC for
       any purpose, and notes that it has not had IETF review. The RFC
       Editor has chosen to publish this document at its discretion. See
       RFC XXXX for more information.
   NOTE TO RFC EDITOR: Please replace "RFC XXXX" with the actual RFC
   number of this document when published, and delete this sentence.

5. Examples of cases where publication is harmful

   This section gives a couple of examples where it might be appropriate
   to delay or prevent publishing of a document due to conflict with
   IETF work. It forms part of the background material, not a part of
   the procedure.

   Publish While Waiting: In 2003, the V6OPS WG was working on
   establishing evaluation criteria for the family of mechanisms known
   as "IPv6 transition mechanisms". The author of one of these
   mechanisms asked for publication as Experimental. The judgment of the
   WG chairs at the time was that publication of this document would
   remove sufficient energy from the group that the evaluation criteria
   work would not be finished, and the IETF would be unable to make a
   well thought out choice between mechanisms to pursue. Thus, the WG
   asked for this document not to be published at that time.

   Rejected Alternative Bypass: A WG is working on a solution to a
   problem, and a participant decides to ask for publication of a
   solution that the WG has rejected. Publication of the document will
   give the publishing party an RFC number to refer to before the WG is
   finished. It seems better to have the WG product published first, and
   have the non-adopted document published later, with a clear
   disclaimer note saying that "the IETF technology for this function is
   X". Example: Photuris (RFC 2522), which was published after IKE (RFC
   2409).

   Inappropriate Reuse of "free" Bits: In 2003, a proposal for an
   experimental RFC was published that wanted to reuse the high bits of
   the "fragment offset" part of the IP header for another purpose.
   There is no IANA consideration saying how these bits can be
   repurposed - but the standard defines a specific meaning for them.
   The IESG concluded that implementations of this experiment risked
   causing hard-to-debug interoperability problems, and recommended not
   publishing the document in the RFC series. The RFC Editor accepted
   the recommendation.

   Note: in general, the IESG has no problem with rejected alternatives
   being made available to the community; such publications can be a
   valuable contribution to the technical literature.  However, it is
   necessary to avoid confusion with the alternatives the working group
   did adopt.

   The RFC series is one of many available publication channels; this
   document takes no position on the question of which documents the RFC
   series is appropriate for - this is a matter for discussion in the
   IETF community.
