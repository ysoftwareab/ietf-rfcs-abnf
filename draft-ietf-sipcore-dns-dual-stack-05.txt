 Locating Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Servers in a Dual-Stack IP
                                Network
                  draft-ietf-sipcore-dns-dual-stack-05

Abstract

   RFC 3263 defines how a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   implementation, given a SIP Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), should
   locate the next-hop SIP server using Domain Name System (DNS)
   procedures.  As SIP networks increasingly transition from IPv4-only
   to dual-stack, a quality user experience must be ensured for dual-
   stack SIP implementations.  This document updates the DNS procedures
   described in RFC 3263 for dual-stack SIP implementations in
   preparation for forthcoming specifications for applying Happy
   Eyeballs principles to SIP.

1.  Introduction

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP, [RFC3261]) and the additional
   documents that extended it provide support for both IPv4 and IPv6.
   However, this support does not fully extend to the highly hybridized
   environments that are characteristic of the transitional migratory
   phase from IPv4 to IPv6 networks.  During this phase, many server and
   client implementations run on dual-stack hosts.  In such
   environments, a dual-stack host will likely suffer greater connection
   delay, and by extension an inferior user experience, than an

   IPv4-only host.  The need to remedy this diminished performance of
   dual-stack hosts led to the development of the Happy Eyeballs
   [RFC6555] algorithm, which has since been implemented in many
   protocols and applications.

   This document updates the DNS lookup procedures of RFC 3263 [RFC3263]
   in preparation for the specification of the application of Happy
   Eyeballs to SIP to provide enhanced performance, and consequently
   user experience, in highly hybridized dual-stack SIP networks.  The
   procedures described herein are such that a dual-stack client should
   look up both A and AAAA records in DNS and then select the best way
   to set up a network flow.  The details of how the latter is done is
   considered out of scope for this document.  See the Happy Eyeballs
   algorithm and implementation and design considerations in RFC 6555
   [RFC6555] for more information about issues with setting up dual-
   stack network flows.

   Section 4 of this document clarifies the interaction of [RFC3263]
   with [RFC6157].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   RFC 3261 [RFC3261] defines additional terms used in this document
   that are specific to the SIP domain such as "proxy", "registrar",
   "redirect server", "user agent server" or "UAS", "user agent client"
   or "UAC", "back-to-back user agent" or "B2BUA", "dialog",
   "transaction", and "server transaction".

   This document uses the term "SIP server" that is defined to include
   the following SIP entities: user agent server, registrar, redirect
   server, a SIP proxy in the role of user agent server, and a B2BUA in
   the role of a user agent server.

   This document also uses the following terminology to make clear
   distinction between SIP entities supporting only IPv4, only IPv6 or
   supporting both IPv4 and IPv6:

   IPv4-only UA/UAC/UAS:  An IPv4-only UA/UAC/UAS supports SIP signaling
      and media only on the IPv4 network.  It does not understand IPv6
      addresses.

   IPv6-only UA/UAC/UAS:  An IPv6-only UA/UAC/UAS supports SIP signaling
      and media only on the IPv6 network.  It does not understand IPv4
      addresses.

Internet-Draft      Locating SIP Servers in IPv4/IPv6         April 2016


   IPv4/IPv6 UA/UAC/UAS:  A UA/UAC/UAS that supports SIP signaling and
      media on both IPv4 and IPv6 networks; such a UA/UAC/UAS is known
      (and will be referred to in this document) as a "dual-stack"
      [RFC4213] UA/UAC/UAS.

   The term "address records" means the DNS records which translate a
   domain name into addresses within the address family(ies) that the
   entity supports (as A records provide IPv4 addresses and AAAA records
   provide IPv6 addresses), regardless of whether the address family was
   defined before or after this document was approved.

3.  DNS Procedures in a Dual-Stack Network

   This specification introduces two normative DNS lookup procedures.
   These are designed to improve the performance of dual-stack clients
   in IPv4/IPv6 networks.

3.1.  Dual-Stack SIP UA DNS Record Lookup Procedure

   Once the transport protocol has been determined, the procedure for
   discovering an IP address if the TARGET is not a numeric IP address
   but the port is explicitly stated in the URI, is detailed in
   Section 4.2 of RFC 3263 [RFC3263].  The piece relevant to this
   discussion is:

      If the TARGET was not a numeric IP address, but a port is present
      in the URI, the client performs an A or AAAA record lookup of the
      domain name.  The result will be a list of IP addresses, each of
      which can be contacted at the specific port from the URI and
      transport protocol determined previously.

   Section 4.2 of RFC 3263 [RFC3263] also goes on to describe the
   procedure for discovering an IP address if the TARGET is not a
   numeric IP address, and no port is present in the URI.  The piece
   relevant to to this discussion is:

      If no SRV records were found, the client performs an A or AAAA
      record lookup of the domain name.  The result will be a list of IP
      addresses, each of which can be contacted using the transport
      protocol determined previously, at the default port for that
      transport.  Processing then proceeds as described above for an
      explicit port once the A or AAAA records have been looked up.

   Happy Eyeballs [RFC6555] documents that looking up the "A or AAAA
   record" is not an effective practice for dual-stack clients and that
   it can add significant connection delay and greatly degrade user
   experience.  Therefore, this document makes the following normative
   addendum to the DNS lookup procedures of Section 4.2 of RFC 3263



Johansson, et al.       Expires October 17, 2016                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft      Locating SIP Servers in IPv4/IPv6         April 2016


   [RFC3263] for IPv4/IPv6 hybrid SIP networks and recommends it as a
   best practice for such dual-stack networks:

      The dual-stack client SHOULD look up all address records (i.e.,
      for all address family(ies) that it supports) for the domain name
      and add the resulting addresses to the list of IP addresses to be
      contacted.  A client MUST be prepared for DNS lookups to return
      addresses in families that it does not support; such addresses
      MUST be ignored as unusable and the supported addresses used as
      specified herein.

3.2.  Indicating Address Family Preference in DNS SRV Records

   The Happy Eyeballs algorithm [RFC6555] is particularly effective when
   dual-stack client applications have significant performance
   differences in their IPv4 or IPv6 network paths.  In this common
   scenario it is often necessary for a dual-stack client to indicate a
   preference for either IPv4 or IPv6.  A service may use DNS SRV
   records to indicate such a preference for an address family.  This
   way, a server with a high-latency and/or low-capacity IPv4 tunnel may
   indicate a preference for being contacted using IPv6.  A server that
   wishes to do this can use the lowest SRV priority to publish
   hostnames that only resolve in IPv6 and the next priority with host
   names that resolve in both address families.

4.  Clarification of RFC 6157

   Section 5 of [RFC6157] specifies that the addresses from the address
   records for a single target DNS name for a server's DNS name must be
   contacted in the order specified by the Source and Destination
   Address Selection algorithms defined in [RFC6724] (the successor of
   [RFC3484]).  Typically, this is done by using the getaddrinfo()
   function to translate the target DNS name into a list of IPv4 and/or
   IPv6 addresses in the order in which they are to be contacted, as
   that function implements [RFC6724].

   Thus, if SRV lookup on the server's DNS name is successful, the major
   ordering of the complete list of destination addresses is determined
   by the priority and weight fields of the SRV records (as specified in
   [RFC2782]) and the (minor) ordering among the destinations derived
   from the "target" field of a single SRV record is determined by
   [RFC6724].

   For example, consider a server with DNS name example.com, with TCP
   transport specified.  The relevant SRV records are:

      _sip._tcp.example.com.  300 IN SRV 10 1 5060 sip-1.example.com.
      _sip._tcp.example.com.  300 IN SRV 20 1 5060 sip-2.example.com.

Internet-Draft      Locating SIP Servers in IPv4/IPv6         April 2016


   The address records for sip-1.example.com, as ordered by [RFC6724],
   are

      sip-1.example.com.  300 IN AAAA 2001:0db8:58:c02::face
      sip-1.example.com.  300 IN AAAA 2001:0db8:c:a06::2:cafe
      sip-1.example.com.  300 IN AAAA 2001:0db8:44:204::d1ce
      sip-1.example.com.  300 IN A 192.0.2.45
      sip-1.example.com.  300 IN A 203.0.113.109
      sip-1.example.com.  300 IN A 198.51.100.24


   and the address records for sip-2.example.com, as ordered by
   [RFC6724], are:

      sip-2.example.com.  300 IN AAAA 2001:0db8:58:c02::dead
      sip-2.example.com.  300 IN AAAA 2001:0db8:c:a06::2:beef
      sip-2.example.com.  300 IN AAAA 2001:0db8:44:204::c0de
      sip-2.example.com.  300 IN A 192.0.2.75
      sip-2.example.com.  300 IN A 203.0.113.38
      sip-2.example.com.  300 IN A 198.51.100.140


   Thus, the complete list of destination addresses has this ordering:

      2001:0db8:58:c02::face
      2001:0db8:c:a06::2:cafe
      2001:0db8:44:204::d1ce
      192.0.2.45
      203.0.113.109
      198.51.100.24
      2001:0db8:58:c02::dead
      2001:0db8:c:a06::2:beef
      2001:0db8:44:204::c0de
      192.0.2.75
      203.0.113.38
      198.51.100.140


   In particular, the destination addresses derived from sip-
   1.example.com and those derived from sip-2.example.com are not
   interleaved; [RFC6724] does not operate on the complete list.  This
   would be true even if the two SRV records had the same priority and
   were (randomly) ordered based on their weights, as the address
   records of two target DNS names are never interleaved.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces two new normative procedures to the existing
   DNS procedures used to locate SIP servers.  While both of these
   procedures are optimizations designed to improve the performance of
   dual-stack clients, neither introduces any new security
   considerations.

   The specific security vulnerabilities, attacks and threat models of
   the various protocols discussed in this document (SIP, DNS, SRV
   records, Happy Eyeballs requirements and algorithm, etc.) are well
   documented in their respective specifications.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any actions by IANA.

8.2.  Changes from draft-ietf-sipcore-dns-dual-stack-03 to draft-ietf-
      sipcore-dns-dual-stack-04

   Changed the "updates" specification to add RFC 3263 and remove RFC
   6157.

   Added Simon Perreault to the acknowledgments.

   Minor wording changes.

8.3.  Changes from draft-ietf-sipcore-dns-dual-stack-02 to draft-ietf-
      sipcore-dns-dual-stack-03

   Described the relationship to RFC 3263 as "update", since the
   existing wording in 3263 is not what we want.  Arguably, the new
   wording is what was intended in 3263, but the existing wording either
   does not say that or says it in a way that is easily misunderstood.

   Described the relationship to RFC 6157 as "clarification", since the
   described interaction between 3263 and 6157 appears to be the only
   reasonable interpretation.

   Revised wording, punctuation, and capitalization in various places.

   Clarified that this draft does not document Happy Eyeballs for SIP,
   but is preparatory for it.

   Attempted to use "update" for text that is definitively a change to
   the preexisting text and "clarify" for text that is a more clear
   statement of the (presumed) intention of the preexisting text.

   Removed normative words from section 1, the introduction.

   Copied definition of "address records" from RFC 2782 (SRV records) to
   allow the specifications to expand automatically to include any new
   address families.

   Relocated the text requiring a client to ignore addresses that it
   discovers in address families it does not support from section 4.2
   (which describes why the situation arises) to section 4.1 (which
   describes how clients look up RRs).

   Clarified the interaction with RFC 6157 (source and destination
   address selection in IPv6) to specify what must have been intended:
   The major sort of the destinations is the ordering determined by
   priority/weight in the SRV records; the addresses derived from a
   single SRV record's target are minorly sorted based on RFC 6157.
