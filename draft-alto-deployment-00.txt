Internet-Draft    ISP ALTO Configuration and Monitoring     October 2010


1.  Introduction

   A basic service of ALTO is to provide information from network
   service providers to applications, in order to improve network
   efficiency and application performance.  Some applications start to
   or have shown interests to conduct integration with ALTO.  Some major
   ISPs (e.g., China Telecom) are in the process of deploying production
   ALTO services in some of their production networks.  As a result,
   more ISPs start to evaluate key issues in the deployment of ALTO in
   their networks.  Thus, a document highlighting some key issues that
   an ISP should consider in the deployment process can be a highly
   valuable reference.

   The objective of this document is to provide such a reference.  The
   document draws on many valuable discussions in the ALTO mailing list
   as well as the predecessor p2pi mailing list.  In addition, it draws
   on the trial experiences of multiple ISPs (e.g.,
   [CTTrial,ComcastTrial].

   The deployment of ALTO involves both ISPs and network applications.
   We can identify four major issues in ALTO deployment:

   1.  How does an ISP deploy and configure its ALTO servers?
       Specifically, an ALTO Server provides the Network Map and the
       Cost Map. How does an ISP configure these maps?  Where does an
       ISP deploy ALTO servers?

   2.  Which application entities fetch ALTO information?

   3.  How does an application integrate ALTO information into its
       decision process?

   4.  How does an ISP (potentially with collaboration from
       applications) monitor the deployment of ALTO, so that the ISP can
       better understand the status as well as the policy impacts of its
       ALTO deployment?

   This document focuses more on the ISP perspective.  Therefore, it
   focuses more on the first and fourth issues.  There are additional
   deployment documents in the ALTO working group.  For example, []
   focuses more on the second issue; [] focuses more on the third issue.
   Our document is complementary to these other documents.


2.  ALTO Server Placement and Configuration

2.1.  Server Placement

2.1.1.  Optimization Area

   An ISP deploys ALTO service to optimize traffic for a given network
   area.  We define a network area for which traffic need be optimized
   using the ALTO service as an optimization area.  A typical
   optimization objective of an ISP is to reduce the inbound and
   outbound traffic across the optimization area, due to the higher cost
   of such traffic.

   An optimization area can be an access network, a MAN, or a larger
   network consisting of both access works and MANs.  An ISP with a
   relatively small network can define a single optimization area and
   deploy an ALTO server for the area.

   An ISP with a larger network may partition its network into multiple
   optimization areas.  Each optimization area may include one or more
   MANs.  Alternatively, the ISP may choose to use a large optimization
   area and distribute a group of ALTO servers.

2.1.2.  Server Load Balancing and Fault Tolerance

2.2.  Network and Cost Map Configuration

   The key components for an ISP to configure when it deploys its ALTO
   service are the Network Map and Cost Map. They have impacts on both
   the load and the effectiveness of the service.

2.2.1.  Network Map and PID

   To define network map in real deployment, the tradeoff network scale
   is very important.  In the research and study point of view, the
   small grain of network map is beneficial to improve the optimization
   result of ALTO service.  But too small grain will lead to the
   complexity of ALTO service running and management.  There may be many
   tables and costs maintained in the ALTO server.  However, too large
   grain can reduce the optimization result of ALTO service, make ALTO
   service nonsense.

   In real network, the Internet is one combination network of multiple
   ISPs around world.  Every ISP operator has its own infrastructure and
   technology to build its ISP network.  Some ISPs only have access
   network, such as school network, enterprise network and so on.  Some
   ISPs have access networks, MAN or Core network, such as telecom
   operator, like China Telecom.

   So, the real network infrastructure can make some natural boundaries.

Internet-Draft    ISP ALTO Configuration and Monitoring     October 2010


   We can give some examples as below.

   1.  Usually, the school, enterprise or organization have their own
       network.  This kind of network is simple infrastructure,
       constituted with several switches and routers.  These networks
       always are connected to Internet through one telecom operator.
       One enterprise network can be identified by one PID.

   2.  The access network, using ADSL technology or Ethernet technology,
       which is very popular in current telecom operator's network or
       some small ISPs, has BAS server to provide access service for its
       subscribers.  Because all its subscribers' traffic must be
       transmitted through its BAS server, this kind of access network
       can be identified by one PID.  There is not necessary to divide
       smaller groups in this kind of access network.

   3.  The MAN usually is constituted with several access networks.  In
       big telecom network, all MANs are connected to Core network, and
       the Core network bandwidth resource is high-cost.  Deploying ALTO
       service in one or several MANs, the traffic can be limited in the
       local MAN, and the Core network resource can be saved.  In this
       scenario, one or several MANs can be identified by one PID.

2.2.2.  Cost Map


3.  ALTO Deployment Monitoring

3.1.  Problem Statement

   In current ALTO architecture, we have no method to understand the
   ALTO service running conditions.  For example, we know ALTO service
   can reduce network resource consumption and accelerate download rate,
   but we cannot know how much traffic can be reduced.  Also in ALTO
   service deployment, many policies can be tried to let ALTO service
   select the most effective policy in different network environment.
   To do this, we have to know the deployment result of different
   policies.

3.2.  Requrements

   To deal with problem above, some requirements are proposed, as below.

   1.  We should analyze which data or information are needed

   2.  Available data source should be studied, including using system
       already deployed or new monitoring system

   3.  Agile transport mechanism from multiple types of source to ALTO
       service

3.3.  Monitoring Metrics

   Currently ALTO service can be applied in multiple applications,
   including P2P, CDN and so on.  But only the scenario integrated with
   P2P application has been deployed in Comcast and CT.  So in this
   document, we mainly consider the P2P application.

   To understand ALTO service running condition or evaluate policies
   result, some data should be defined, which are named as Metric in
   this document.  We think through these metrics, the ALTO service
   deployment can be understood more exactly or even improved.

   First, we define domain as one or many groups of Endpoints.  That is,
   one domain includes one PID or some PIDs.  Endpoints and PID are
   defined in "draft-ietf-alto-protocol-05".

   From ISP's point of view, we can define some metrics as below:

   o  Metric 1 (Inter-domain IP traffic): To evaluate how ALTO service
      can reduce network resource consumption, the total traffic
      information has to known.  For example, before we deploy ALTO
      service in one domain of network, we should know the inbound and
      outbound traffic condition of this domain.  This traffic includes
      total traffic information, in current Internet, usually is IP
      traffic.

   o  Metric 2 (Inter-domain application traffic): The optimizing
      traffic in ALTO service is application layer traffic.  So this
      metric is very important in ALTO service.  ALTO service mainly
      reduces the inter-traffic between domains, so the inter-domain
      application traffic change condition before and after ALTO service
      deploying can give the result of ALTO service.  This metric is
      always used with Metric 1 and 3.

   o  Metric 3 (Inner-domain application traffic): One of the ALTO
      service primary functions is application traffic localization.
      This metric can provide the efficacy result of ALTO service and
      different policies.  This metric is always used with Metric 1 and
      2.

   From application service provider's point of view, we can define some
   metrics as below:

   o  Metric 4 (Peer user distribution in domain): This metric is only
      for P2P application.  In P2P overlay, peer distribution

Internet-Draft    ISP ALTO Configuration and Monitoring     October 2010


      information can provide some hints to understand this overlay
      architecture.  This information can be helpful to understand the
      P2P overlay.

   o  Metric 5 (Peer list condition): This metric is only for P2P
      application.  In P2P application, every p2p client need connect
      with other p2p clients.  The list of these p2p clients is named as
      peer list for one request peer client.  The ALTO service let peer
      list more localization.  So this metric can be helpful to give the
      efficacy result of ALTO service and different policies.

   o  Metric 6 (Global average download rate): This metric provides the
      application performance directly.  Download means inbound traffic
      to one user.  Global average means the average value of all users
      download rate in one or more domains.  We can compare this metric
      before and after deployment ALTO service in one domain to
      understand the ALTO service.

   o  Metric 7 (Global average connection hop): This metric provides the
      application performance indirectly.  One of ALTO protocol's aims
      is to reduce the network path hops of one data connection.  This
      metric gives the average hops of all connections in one or more
      domains.  We can compare this metric before and after deployment
      ALTO service in one domain to understand the ALTO service.

   o  Metric 8 (Global average cache time): This metric is for streaming
      application.  This metric means the time between the clients
      starting to download streaming packets and the streaming content
      starting to play in the player.  Global average means the average
      value of all cache time in one or more domains.  We can compare
      this metric before and after deployment ALTO service in one domain
      to understand the ALTO service.

   o  Metric 9 (jitter time)

3.4.  Monitoring Data Sources

   The metrics can be obtained come from multiple locations.  There are
   already some monitor and measurement methods deployed in current
   network, such as netflow, DPI and so on.  Also, we need add some new
   methods for monitor application performance.

   We identify four data sources are defined as below.

3.4.1.  Log Server

   Log Server of service providers' network architecture is used to
   monitor all running conditions of service operation.  Commonly,



Sun                      Expires April 15, 2011                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    ISP ALTO Configuration and Monitoring     October 2010


   service providers deploy Log Server to collect data of their
   operation condition by themselves, usually using private protocol.
   In our scenario, Log Server can provide more information about
   service operation, service using condition and more exact
   information.  For example, to one P2P service system, Log Server can
   provide some data, such as peer distribution information, peer list
   selection information and so on.

3.4.2.  P2P Clients

   In some P2P overlays, there is no central Log Server.  Also we can
   obtain some information from P2P client directly.  The information is
   same as Log Server.

3.4.3.  OAM

   OAM systems have been deployed in all networks, and mainly are used
   to monitor IP layer traffic condition.  OAM can provide the traffic
   information of every network device in its management area, including
   link physical bandwidth, traffic and so on.  In our scenario, some
   monitor points can be configured in OAM system to monitor IP layer
   traffic information, such as inter-domain IP layer traffic.

3.4.4.  DPI

   DPI systems have been deployed in large scale in may ISPs' network.
   ISPs use DPI system to understand their application layer traffic.
   Differ from OAM system, DPI system can provide application layer
   information of network traffic.  In our scenario, using DPI system,
   we can know P2P traffic condition exactly in the network, such as the
   P2P traffic proportion of overall IP traffic, or the traffic
   proportion information of different P2P service providers.

3.5.  New Entities

   Some new entities and transport protocol are added to current ALTO
   architecture.  Monitor Service usually is deployed in the ALTO
   service Provider, commonly in ISP network.  It is in charge of
   collecting data from all data resources.  Monitor Client usually is
   deployed in Service Provider, such as in P2P operator or CDN
   operator.  It can obtain raw data from Log Server or P2P clients
   locally, and transmits the data needed according to the protocol and
   format defined in this document.

3.6.  Monitoring Example

3.6.1.  Overview

   From analysis above, we can know there are multiple type sources.  To
   these sources, some have standard protocol and interface, such as
   OAM; some have private protocol; or even some have no transport
   protocol currently.  To deal with this condition, one agile transport
   protocol suite is needed.  It can use standard protocol in some data
   sources.  Also it can use new transport protocol in some data
   sources.

   Some new modules and transport protocol are added to current ALTO
   architecture.  Monitor Service usually is deployed in the ALTO
   service Provider, commonly in ISP network.  It is in charge of
   collecting data from all data resources.  Monitor Client usually is
   deployed in Service Provider, such as in P2P operator or CDN
   operator.  It can obtain raw data from Log Server or P2P clients
   locally, and transmits the data needed according to the protocol and
   format defined in this document.  We can give one example as below.

3.6.2.  Protocol

   Some data sources already have standard protocol and interface, and
   then we can also use this protocol.  To some data sources, which have
   no public transport protocols, the new protocol can be defined as
   below.

   Monitor Client sends message to Monitor Server to report defined
   information periodically.  The period time can be configured in the
   system.

   In the message body field of Data Report message, we can use the
   definition in draft "draft-ietf-alto-protocol-05".
