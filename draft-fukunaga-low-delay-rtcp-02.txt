1. Abstract

   Low delay feedback in RTP has gained a lot of interest recently in
   order to enhance the performance in RTP sessions with two or only a
   small number of participants. A recent document describes rules that
   enhance the functionality of the existing RTP timing and allow low
   delay feedback. While that document describes when it is allowed to
   send data, we describe here what kind of low delay feedback may be
   sent. Therefore we define three general RTCP feedback message types
   as well as some recommendations how the sender SHOULD react to
   certain feedback. The message types can either be used as is or they
   can be extended in payload or application specific ways.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [2].


3. Introduction

   RTP and its profile define strict rules on the timing behavior of
   RTCP feedback. It is very important for large multicast groups to
   define such rules, because the traffic on the feedback channel might
   explode otherwise. However for small multicast groups or even
   unicast, a frequently used application of RTP, the rules can be less
   strict.

   A new feedback timing behavior for RTP is defined in [8]. The
   document describes in certain scenarios when it is allowed to send
   feedback. These new timing rules scale from unicast connections,
   where feedback is possible anytime immediately to small multicast
   groups, where feedback can be sent with low delay according to a
   credit based scheduling scheme.

   While [8] describes the behavior when the receiver is allowed to
   send feedback, this document describes a framework what is going to
   be sent. Section 4 describes three general feedback packet types.
   General formats and semantics are given, but room is left for the
   extension to specific feedback messages. Section 5 describes some
   recommendations how the sender SHOULD react if certain feedback is
   received. Especially congestion control items are discussed.


4 Low Delay Feedback Packets

   In this document we define a framework of low delay RTCP feedback
   messages. Therefore three different types of messages are defined,
   which are categorized as follows:

   - Transport Layer Feedback Messages
   - Payload Specific Feedback Messages
   - Application Layer Feedback Messages

   Transport Layer Feedback Messages are used to transmit protocol
   related information from the receiver to the sender. This
   information could be a general acknowledgement (ACK) or negative-
   acknowledgement (NACK). It could be thought of other types of
   Transport Layer Feedback Messages, which can be registered later
   then.

   Payload Specific Feedback Messages transport information that is
   specific to certain payloads. The format and type of information is
   defined either directly within an RTP Payload Format or in
   additional feedback format documents.

   Application Layer Feedback Messages are used to transport
   application specific feedback directly from the receiver's
   application to the sender's application. These data that is sent
   between the applications is usually defined in the application's
   specification, e.g. NEWPRED messages are defined in MPEG-4
   specification. The data can be identified by the application and
   therefore needs no additional external information.

   The general syntax and semantics for the three packet types is
   described in the following subsections.


4.1 Transport Layer Feedback Messages

   This feedback messages are used to inform the sender's RTP protocol
   entity about certain events that the receiver detected. These events
   could be e.g. the reception of a packet or the detection of a packet
   loss.

   The generic format of the packet is as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   The various fields V, P, SSRC and length are defined in the RTP
   specification [3]. We summarize the meaning of all of the fields
   below:

   version (V): 2 bits
   This field identifies the RTP version.  The current version is 2.

   padding (P): 1 bit
   If set, the padding bit indicates that the packet contains
   additional padding octets at the end which are not part of the
   control information but are included in the length field.

   early packet (E): 1 bit
   This bit is set if the packet is sent early. A detailed description
   can be found in [8].

   feedback message type (FMT): 4 bits
   This field identifies the type of the feedback. The packet can be
   used for different purposes. The following types are defined (up to
   now):

      0:    forbidden
      1:    General NACK
      2:    General ACK
      3-15: reserved

   packet type (PT): 8 bits
   This is the RTCP packet type which identifies the packet as being an
   RTP Feedback Message.

   length: 16 bits
   The length of this packet in 32-bit words minus one, including the
   header and any padding. This conforms with the definition of the
   length field used in RTCP sender and receiver reports [3].

   SSRC of packet sender: 16 bits
   The synchronization source identifier for the originator of this
   packet.

   SSRC of media source: 16 bits
   The synchronization source identifier of the media source that this
   feedback is related to.

   feedback control information (FCI): variable length
   Format and semantic of the FCI varies for the different message
   types. See sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.2 for the definition of the syntax
   and the semantic of this field for the general NACK and ACK packets.


4.1.1 General NACK

   In this section the general NACK packet is described. As said above,
   the general NACK packet is of the type Transport Layer Feedback
   Message. The basic header of section 5.1 applies for this packet,
   where FMT is set to 1 (General NACK).

   The general NACK packet is used to indicate the loss of one or
   several RTP packets. Therefore the lost packet(s) are identified by
   the means of a packet identifier and a bitmask.

   The Feedback control information (FCI) field has the following
   syntax:

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Packet ID (PID): 16 bits
   The PID field is used to specify a lost packet.  RTP Payload Formats
   may decide how to identify a packet.  Typically RTP sequence number
   is used for PID as the default format.

   bitmask of following lost packets (BLP): 15 bits
   The BLP allows for reporting losses of any of the 15 RTP packets
   immediately following the RTP packet indicated by the PID.  The
   BLP's definition is identical to that given in [RFC2032].  Denoting
   the BLP's least significant bit as bit 1, and its most significant
   bit as bit 15, then bit i of the bitmask is set to 1 if the sender
   has not received RTP packet number PID+i (modulo 2^16) and the
   receiver decides this packet is lost; bit i is set to 0 otherwise.
   Note that the sender MUST NOT assume that a receiver has received a
   packet because its bitmask was set to 0.  For example, the least
   significant bit of the BLP would be set to 1 if the packet
   corresponding to the PID and the following packet have been lost.
   However, the sender cannot infer that packets PID+2 through PID+15
   have been received simply because bits 2 through 15 of the BLP are
   0; all the sender knows is that the receiver has not reported them
   as lost at this time.


4.1.2 General ACK

   The general ACK packet is also of the type Transport Layer Feedback
   Message and therefore uses the header as defined in section 5.1 with
   FMT=2 (general ACK).

   The general ACK packet is used to indicate that one or several RTP
   packets are received correctly. Therefore the received packet(s) are
   identified by the means of a packet identifier and a bitmask. Acking
   of a range of consecutive packets is also possible.

   The Feedback control information (FCI) field has the following
   syntax:

       0                   1                   2                   3

   Packet ID (1st PID): 16 bits
   This PID field is used to specify a correctly received packet. RTP
   Payload Formats may decide how to identify a packet. Typically RTP
   sequence number is used for PID as the default format.

   Range of ACKs (R): 1 bit
   The R-bit indicates that a range of consecutive packets are received
   correctly. The 1st PID field specifies the first packet of that
   range and the next field (BLP/PID) will carry the last PID of the
   range that is acknowledged.

   bitmask of following lost packets / Packet ID (BLP/PID): 15 bits
   The semantic of this field changes according to the value of the R-
   field. If R=1, this field is used to identify the last packet of the
   acknowledged packet range, as described above.
   If R=0, this field carries a bitmask. The BLP allows for reporting
   reception of any of the 15 RTP packets immediately following the RTP
   packet indicated by the PID.  The BLP's definition is identical to
   that given in [RFC2032].  Denoting the BLP's least significant bit
   as bit 1, and its most significant bit as bit 15, then bit i of the
   bitmask is set to 1 if the sender has received RTP packet number
   PID+i (modulo 2^16) and the receiver decides to ACK this packet; bit
   i is set to 0 otherwise.


4.2 Payload Specific Feedback Messages

   Packets of the type Payload Specific Feedback Messages are used to
   transport information from the receiver to the sender that is
   directly related to the payload of the forward stream. Messages of
   this type include e.g. Picture or Slice Loss Indications.

   The basic header format is described below.

       0                   1                   2                   3

   The various fields V, P, SSRC and length are defined in the RTP
   specification [3]. We summarize the meaning of all of the fields
   below:

   version (V): 2 bits
   This field identifies the RTP version.  The current version is 2.

   padding (P): 1 bit
   If set, the padding bit indicates that the packet contains
   additional padding octets at the end which are not part of the
   control information but are included in the length field.

   early packet (E): 1 bit
   This bit is set if the packet is sent early. A detailed description
   can be found in [8].

   feedback message type (FMT): 4 bits
   This field identifies the type of the feedback. Every RTP Payload
   Format has its own FMT number space, i.e. a certain FMT number can
   have different meanings for different payload types. It is therefore
   expected that either the RTP Payload Format documents itself or
   additional feedback format documents (related to one or several
   Payload Formats) define the FMT numbers and their meanings. FMT=0 is
   forbidden.

   packet type (PT): 8 bits
   This is the RTCP packet type which identifies the packet as being an
   Payload Specific Feedback Message.

   length: 16 bits
   The length of this packet in 32-bit words minus one, including the
   header and any padding. This conforms with the definition of the
   length field used in RTCP sender and receiver reports [3].

   SSRC of packet sender: 16 bits
   The synchronization source identifier for the originator of this
   packet.

   SSRC of media source: 16 bits
   The synchronization source identifier of the media source that this
   feedback is related to.

   RTP payload type (RTP PT): 7 bits
   This field indicates the payload format to which the feedback is
   related. It is important to use that field, because the session
   could be used with several payload formats on the forward direction
   and the semantics of the packet is different for different payload
   formats.

   feedback control information (FCI): variable length
   Format and semantic of the FCI varies for the different message
   types. The type of FCI that is used is indicated by the combination
   of FMT and RTP PT. The mapping of FMT numbers to FCIs is expected to

   be described in additional payload specific documents or the RTP
   Payload Formats.


4.2.1 Example

   This section describes a short example how the payload specific
   feedback messages can be defined and used.

   As an example we consider a predictive coded video application. If
   packet loss occurs, it is important that the sender gets this
   information, because it will otherwise send data, which the receiver
   might not be able to use.

   Therefore an additional document can describe a feedback message,
   which works as a picture or slice loss indication. If the sender
   receives this message, it might start with a new intra coded frame,
   which the receiver would be able to use properly.

   The document must specify the format of the FCI-field, one or
   several RTP payload formats, for which this should be used and a FMT
   number that is not allocated in all of these formats. A different
   possibility is to define the FMT number and FCI syntax directly in a
   video RTP Payload Format.


4.3 Application Layer Feedback Messages

   These messages are used to transport application defined data
   directly from the receiver's to the sender's application. The data
   that is transported is not identified by the feedback message.
   Therefore the application must be able to identify the messages
   payload.

   Usually applications define their own set of messages, e.g. NEWPRED
   messages in MPEG-4 or feedback messages in H.263/Annex N,U. These
   messages do not need any additional information from the RTCP
   message and thus this message has the following simple format:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   The various fields V, P, SSRC and length are defined in the RTP
   specification [3]. We summarize the meaning of all of the fields
   below:

   version (V): 2 bits
   This field identifies the RTP version.  The current version is 2.

   early packet (E): 1 bit
   This bit is set if the packet is sent early. A detailed description
   can be found in [8].

   padding (P): 1 bit
   If set, the padding bit indicates that the packet contains
   additional padding octets at the end which are not part of the
   control information but are included in the length field. The last
   octet of the padding is a count of how many padding octets should be
   ignored.

   feedback message type(FMT): 4 bits
   This field identifies the type of the feedback. The packet can be
   used for different purposes. No type is defined up to now:

      0:    forbidden
      1-15: reserved

   packet type (PT): 8 bits
   This is the RTCP packet type which identifies the packet as being an
   Application Feedback Message.


   length: 16 bits
   The length of this packet in 32-bit words minus one, including the
   header and any padding. This conforms with the definition of the
   length field used in RTCP sender and receiver reports [3].

   SSRC of packet sender: 16 bits
   The synchronization source identifier for the originator of this
   packet.

   SSRC of media source: 16 bits
   The synchronization source identifier of the media source that this
   feedback is related to.

   Application Message (FCI): variable length
   This field contains the original application message that should be
   transported from the receiver to the source. The format is
   application dependent. The length of this field is variable. If the
   application data is not four-byte aligned, padding must be added.

4.3.1 Example

   An example usage of the Application Feedback Message is NEWPRED for
   MPEG-4. The NEWPRED messages are defined in the MPEG-4
   specification. The MPEG-4 entity at the receiver sends the message,
   which is transported in the application feedback packet. It is then
   given to the MPEG-4 entity at the sender, which can identify the
   information as a NEWPRED message and knows what to do with it.

   Normally one NEWPRED message is mapped onto one AFM-RTCP packet, and
   several messages could be continuously mapped onto one AFM-RTCP
   packet. In the case several messages are mapped onto one AFM-RTCP
   packet, padding should only be required on the last individual
   message. One message SHALL NOT be fragmented into different AFM-RTCP
   packets.


5. Reaction to Feedback

   In the previous sections the feedback messages were defined as well
   as the timing rules when it is allowed to send these messages. We
   defined only the feedback messages, because we cannot foresee all
   purposes for which application designers would want to use the low
   delay feedback and thus the reaction to the messages is generally
   left to the application. However this section describes some rules
   and recommendations of what the sender SHOULD or MAY do in the event
   of receiving a low delay feedback message.


5.1 Congestion Control

   Congestion control for real-time or near real-time traffic,
   especially for unicast, is not new. Recently a mechanism called TFRC
   (TCP-Friendly-Rate-Control), [9], was introduced in the TSV working
   group for standardization. This mechanism controls the sending bit
   rate according to monitored network conditions in a TCP friendly
   way, i.e. in the long-term, the RTP traffic shares the bandwidth
   fair with TCP connections. Other mechanisms are subject of research
   everywhere and may be applicable for the use in RTP.

   Low delay feedback supports the use of these congestion control
   algorithms. Due to the frequent feedback messages, it is possible
   for the sender to monitor the network state closely and therefore it
   is possible to react to upcoming congestion in time. This minimizes
   the congestion related packet loss and serves the network stability.

   A congestion control algorithm that shares the available bandwidth
   fair with competing TCP connections, e.g. TFRC, SHOULD be used if
   the low delay RTP session is transmitted in an best effort
   environment.

5.2 Reactions to Feedback Messages

   As described in section 4 feedback messages are either processed
   directly by the RTP entity or the application that uses RTP. However
   the exact behavior is implementation, negotiation and environment
   dependent. In this section we describe how the sender may react and
   what he should not do.

   At reception of a Transport Layer Feedback Message, the RTP entity
   evaluates the message and reacts to it. At detection of a packet
   loss, either by receiving a NACK, missing an ACK or other means, the
   RTP entity MAY invoke error resilience features such as
   retransmissions. However if the session is transmitted in an best
   effort environment, the sender SHOULD NOT increase the sending bit
   rate at detection of a packet loss. Possible reactions are to
   retransmit important data, while non-important packets that were
   scheduled for transmission are discarded in the sender.

   At reception of a Payload Type or Application Defined Message the
   application related part is given to the application, while the
   attached receiver report (all feedback is sent at least in minimum
   compound packets) SHOULD be evaluated in the RTP entity and MAY
   serve as the input for the congestion control algorithm (see
   previous section for details about congestion control).
