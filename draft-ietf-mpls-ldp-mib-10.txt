INTERNET-DRAFT                MPLS LDP MIB                    April 2003


1.  Introduction

   This document defines 4 MIB Modules which together support the
   configuration and monitoring of the Label Distribution Protocol
   (LDP).  The Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) [RFC3036] is one type
   of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) protocols described in
   [RFC3031] and [RFC3032].  Utilizing all 4 MIB Modules allows an
   operator to configure LDP sessions using 3 different Layer 2 media.
   The Layer 2 media supported by the MIB Modules are Ethernet, ATM and
   Frame Relay as described in [RFC3036], [RFC3034] and [RFC3035].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

INTERNET-DRAFT                MPLS LDP MIB                    April 2003


3.  Structure of the MIB

   This section describes the structure of the LDP MIB.


3.1.  Overview

   There are 4 MIB Modules in this document.  These MIB Modules are the
   MPLS-LDP-MIB, the MPLS-LDP-GENERIC-MIB, the MPLS-LDP-ATM-MIB and the
   MPLS-LDP-FRAME-RELAY-MIB.  The MPLS-LDP-MIB defines objects which are
   common to all LDP implementations.  The MPLS-LDP-GENERIC-MIB defines
   Layer 2 Per Platform Label Space objects for use with the MPLS-LDP-
   MIB.  The MPLS-LDP-ATM-MIB defines Layer 2 Asynchronous Transfer Mode
   (ATM) objects for use with the MPLS-LDP-MIB.  The MPLS-LDP-FRAME-
   RELAY-MIB defines Layer 2 FRAME-RELAY objects for use with the MPLS-
   LDP-MIB.

   The MPLS-LDP-MIB Module MUST be implemented and at least one of the
   Layer 2 MIB Modules MUST be implemented.  As an example, if an LSR
   implementation wants to support LDP utilizing a Layer 2 of Ethernet,
   then the MPLS-LDP-MIB and the MPLS-LDP-GENERIC-MIB Modules would be
   implemented.  If an LSR implementation wants to support LDP utilizing
   a Layer 2 of ATM, then the MPLS-LDP-MIB Module MUST be implemented
   and the MPLS-LDP-ATM-MIB Module would be implemented.  If an LSR
   implementation wants to support LDP utilizing a Layer 2 of FRAME-
   RELAY, then the MPLS-LDP-MIB Module would be implemented and the
   MPLS-LDP-FRAME-RELAY-MIB Module would be implemented.  An LDP
   implementation that utilizes all 3 Layer 2 media (Ethernet, Frame-
   Relay, ATM) would support all 4 MIB Modules.  Each of the Modules
   will be discussed in detail in the following sections.

   There are 2 Compliance statements for each MIB Module.  One which is
   for FULL Compliance which includes configuration and monitoring via
   SNMP.  The other is a READ-ONLY Compliance which is only monitoring
   via SNMP.


3.2.  Future Considerations

   The LDP Specification [RFC3036] does not specify the use of VPNs or
   multicast for LDP, and thus, objects related to these areas have not
   been included in the MIB.

   This MIB does not include VP merge configuration either.  [RFC2684]
   does not yet describe this capability and so it has been excluded
   from the MIB.

INTERNET-DRAFT                MPLS LDP MIB                    April 2003


   These areas need to be specified in the LDP Specification or other
   specifications prior to being added in this or any other MIB.


3.3.  Interface Indexing

   Interface Indexes as specified in [RFC2863] are used in the MIB.  The
   descriptions of the ifIndexes denote which ifIndex is being used.
   NOTE:  the use of ifIndex is for actual existing connections.


3.4.  Differences from the LDP Specification

   Currently, there are 3 differences between this specification and the
   LDP Specification.  As previously mentioned, this MIB is almost
   entirely based on the LDP specification.  The differences are
   documented here in the hope to avoid any confusion between the two
   documents.

   The first difference is that the LDP Entity Table contains some
   DEFVAL clauses which are not specified explicitly in the LDP
   Specification.  These values, although not documented in the LDP
   Specification are widely used by existing LDP MIB implementations and
   thus, have been adopted within this MIB.  Please note, they can
   certainly be changed during row creation or a subsequent set request.

   A second difference is the mplsLdpEntityConfGenericLabelRangeTable.
   This table, although provided as a way to reserve a range of generic
   labels, does not exist in the LDP Specification.  It was added to the
   MIB due to a request from the working group and because this table
   was considered useful for reserving a range of generic labels.

   The third difference is documented by the TEXTUAL-CONVENTION,
   MplsAtmVcIdentifier which is in the MPLS-TC-MIB [MPLSTCMIB].  This TC
   was added to restrict vci values to be greater than 31 as described
   in RFC 3035 [RFC3035].


3.5.  The MPLS-LDP-MIB Module

   This MIB Module contains objects which are common to all LDP
   implementations.  This MIB Module MUST always be implemented along
   with one or more of the Layer 2 MIB Modules.

   NOTE, this table allows the Label Edge Router (LER) or the Label
   Switching router (LSR) to initiate and/or receive requests to

   establish LDP sessions.  As the LDP protocol distributes labels and
   establishes sessions with Peers most of the tables in this MIB are
   populated by the agent as instructed by the LDP protocol.  The
   exception is the mplsFecTable and the mplsLdpLspFecTable which can be
   configured by the operator to specify Forwarding Equivalence Class
   information for an LSP.

   Each table in this MIB Module is described in the following
   subsections.


3.5.1.  The LDP Entity Table

   The MPLS-LDP-MIB provides objects to configure/set-up potential LDP
   sessions on a specific LSR.  The mplsLdpEntityTable is used to
   configure potential LDP Sessions, where each row in the table
   represents a potential LDP Session.

   Each entry/row in this table represents a single LDP Entity.  There
   is no maximum number of LDP Entities specified.  However, there is an
   mplsLdpEntityIndexNext object which should be retrieved by the
   command generator prior to creating an LDP Entity.  If the
   mplsLdpEntityIndexNext object is zero, this indicates that the LSR is
   not able to create another LDP Entity at that time.


3.5.1.1.  Changing Values After Session Establishment

   One way to manually modify a session's parameters is by using SNMP to
   change the MIB objects related to that session.  Please note special
   care should be taken if MIB objects which are used in the MPLS LDP
   Session Initialization need to be modified.  If the modification of
   any of these MIB variables takes place anytime after the start of
   session intialization, then the entire session must be halted.  Any
   information learned by that session must be discarded. The objects
   should then be modified, and session initialization started.

   For example, assume that an operator wishes to change the
   configuration of a Label Range which is used by a Session that has
   already been established.  The operator should change the
   mplsLdpEntityAdminStatus to "disable(2)".  Setting the
   mplsLdpEntityAdminStatus to "disable(2)" will cause the session to be
   torn down (i.e. this will signal to LDP that it should send out tear
   down messages for that session).  Also, all information related to
   that session should be removed from this MIB by the Agent.  This
   includes Peer information (i.e. relevant row in the mplsPeerTable)


Expires October 2003                                            [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT                MPLS LDP MIB                    April 2003


   and Session statistics (i.e. releveant row in the mplsLdpSesTable).
   Also, if the LSR MIB is implemented and the optional Mapping Table
   objects are implemented, then all information related to the LSPs in
   this session should be removed from these MIBs. [For more information
   please see the section on "The Mapping Tables".]  At this point, the
   operator could modify the Label Range.  Lastly, the operator should
   set the mplsLdpEntityAdminStatus to "enable(1)".  At this point
   session initialization should occur.  The LDP Entity goes through the
   Session Initialization in order to communicate the new Label Ranges
   to the Peer and establish new LSPs.


3.5.2.  The LDP Entity Statistics Table

   The mplsLpdEntityStatsTable is a read-only table which contains
   statistical information related to failed attempts to establish
   sessions.  Each row in this table is related to a single LDP entity
   and this table AUGMENTS an mplsLdpEntityEntry.  This table could be
   used to give insight into how to reconfigure values so that a session
   could be successfully established.  For example, if the
   mplsLdpSesRejectedLRErrors Counter object was increasing, then this
   would indicate that the Label Range (LR) may need to be adjusted.


3.5.3.  The LDP Peer Table

   The LDP Peer Table is a read-only table which contains information
   about LDP Peers known to LDP Entities.  In other words, the Peer
   information is learned by LDP through initialization or discovery.
   This table should be populated by the agent as directed by the LDP
   protocol.

   A row in this table is related to one or more rows in the Hello
   Adjacency Table and related to a single row in the Session Table.
   The values in the Peer table are specific to a Peer and may or may
   not be the same values used in the session.  The reason is that the
   Peer and Entity negotiate certain values.  The Entity's values are
   configured in the mplsLdpEntityTable and the Peer's values are
   learned (and placed into the mplsLdpPeerTable).  The
   mplsLdpSessionTable shows the values used in establishing the
   session.

   One example, of when the Peer's values and the Session's values may
   differ is with the Peer's Path Limit information.  The Peer's Path
   Limit information is learned from the session initialization phase.
   The actual value for the Path Vector Limit is the Peer's value and


Expires October 2003                                            [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT                MPLS LDP MIB                    April 2003


   may not be the same value that appears in the session.  There could
   be a mismatch in this value between the Entity and the Peer. In the
   event of a mismatch, then the session will use the Path Limit set by
   the Entity (and not the Peer).

   The Peer Table information was placed in a separate table from the
   Session information to allow for a  more comprehensive and coherent
   MIB model.


3.5.4.  The LDP Session Table

   The LDP Session Table is a read-only table.  Each entry in this table
   represents a single session between an LDP Entity and a Peer. The
   mplsLdpSessionEntry AUGMENTS the mplsLdpPeerEntry.

   The information in this table is learned during session
   establishment.  NOTE: rows in this table will appear during session
   intialization.


3.5.5.  The LDP Session Statistics Table

   The MPLS LDP Session Stats Table is a read-only table which contains
   statistical information on sessions.


3.5.6.  The LDP Hello Adjacencies Table

   This is a table of all adjacencies between all LDP Entities and all
   LDP Peers.  A Session may have one or more adjacencies.  A session
   should not have zero adjacencies, because this indicates that the
   session has lost contact with the Peer.  A session which has zero
   Hello Adjacencies should be eventually removed.


3.5.7.  The LDP LSP Table

   The Label Information Base (LIB) contains information about labels
   learned by the LSR.  The LIB for LDP, CR-LDP and MPLS-RSVP (i.e. all
   currently defined MPLS protocols) is represented in the LSR MIB
   [LSRMIB].  The LIB is represented by the LSR MIB's mplsXCTable (mpls
   Cross Connect Table), mplsInSegmentTable (mpls In Segment Table) and
   the mplsOutSegmentTable (mpls Out Segment Table).  The mplsXCTable
   models the cross-connection of the ingress label with a specific
   egress label.  The mplsInSegmentTable stores the ingress label's


Expires October 2003                                            [Page 9]

INTERNET-DRAFT                MPLS LDP MIB                    April 2003


   information, and the mplsOutSegmentTable stores the egress label's
   information.

   The LDP Session that created the LSP and the LSP's (ingress label,
   egress label) pair along with other information is contained in the
   LSR MIB's mplsXCTable, the mplsInSegmentTable and the
   mplsOutSegmentTable.

   In order to utilize the LSR MIB's mplsXCTable, mplsInSegmentTable and
   mplsOutSegmentTable for LDP LSPs, there needs to be a mechanism to
   associate LDP sessions with LDP LSPs created as a result of those LDP
   sessions.  The mplsInSegmentLdpLspTable and mplsOutSegmentLdpLspTable
   in this MIB contain information to find the LDP LSP entries in the
   mplsInSegmentTable, mplsOutSegmentTable and the mplsXCTable.

   These two tables, the mplsInSegmentLdpLspTable and
   mplsOutSegmentLdpLspTable, have been made optional in the conformance
   section of the MIB.  They only need to be supported if the LSR MIBs
   mplsInSegmentTable, mplsOutSegmentTable and mplsXCTable are
   implemented.

   As discussed in the section, "Changing Values after Session
   Establishment", if a session is torn down, then all the information
   related to this session, must be removed from the both LDP MIB and,
   if implemented, from the LSR MIB.


3.5.8.  The FEC Table

   The FEC Table is a table which contains FEC (Forwarding Equivalence
   Class) information.  Each entry/row represents a single FEC Element.
   There is also an LDP LSP FEC Table, mplsLdpLspFecTable, which
   associates FECs with the LSPs.


3.5.9.  The LDP Session Peer Address Table

   The MPLS LDP Session Peer Address Table is a table which extends the
   mplsLdpSessionTable.  This table is a read-only table which stores
   Addresses learned after session initialization via Address Message
   advertisement.

INTERNET-DRAFT                MPLS LDP MIB                    April 2003


3.6.  LDP Notifications

   Currently, there are several notifications which are specific for
   LDP.  These are described in this section.

   The mplsLdpInitSesThresholdExceeded notification indicates to the
   operator that there may be a misconfigured mplsLdpEntityEntry because
   the session associated with this Entity is not being established, and
   the Entity keeps trying to establish the session.  A side effect of
   this situation is that a row in the mplsLdpSessionTable may not be
   reaching the operational state as indicated by the mplsLdpSesState
   object.  If the value of mplsLdpEntityInitSesThreshold is 0 (zero)
   then this is equal to specifying the value of infinity for the
   threshold, and the mplsLdpInitSesThresholdExceeded notification will
   never be sent.

   The mplsLdpPathVectorLimitMismatch notification is generated when
   there is a mismatch in the Path Vector Limits between the Entity and
   Peer during session initialization.  The session uses the value which
   is configured as the Entity's Path Vector Limit.  However, a
   notification should be generated to indicate that a mismatch
   occurred.  For further details, please see Section 3.5.3 of the LDP
   Specification [RFC3036].

   The mplsLdpSessionUp and mplsLdpSessionDown notifications are
   generated when there is an appropriate change in the mplsLdpSesState
   object, e.g. when sessions change state (Up to Down for the
   mplsLdpSessionDown trap, or Down to Up for the mplsLdpSessionUp
   trap).

             interpretted in conjunction with the
             mplsLdpEntityTargetPeer object.

             If the value of this object is 0: if the value of the
             mplsLdpEntityTargetPeer object is false(2), then this
             specifies that the Hold Time's actual default value is
             15 seconds (i.e. the default Hold time for Link Hellos
             is 15 seconds).  Otherwise if the value of the
             mplsLdpEntityTargetPeer object is true(1), then this
             specifies that the Hold Time's actual default value is
             45 seconds (i.e. the default Hold time for Targeted
             Hellos is 45 seconds).

             A value of 65535 means infinite (i.e. wait forever).

             All other values represent the amount of time in
             seconds to wait for a Hello Message.  Setting the
             hold time to a value smaller than 15 is not
             recommended, although not forbidden according

4.1.  The MPLS-LDP-ATM-MIB Module

   This MIB Module MUST be supported if LDP uses ATM as the Layer 2
   media.  There are three tables in this MIB Module.  Two tables are

   for configuring LDP to use ATM.  These tables are the
   mplsLdpEntityAtmParmsTable and the mplsLdpEntityAtmLabelRangeTable.

   The mplsLdpEntityAtmParmsTable provides a way to configure
   information which would be contained in the "Optional Parameter"
   portion of an LDP PDU Initialization Message.

   The mplsLdpEntityAtmLabelRangeTable provides a way to configure
   information which would be contained in the "ATM Label Range
   Components" portion of an LDP PDU Intialization Message, see
   [RFC3035] and [RFC3036].


4.1.1.  The LDP ATM Session Table

   The MPLS LDP ATM Session Table is a read-only table which contains
   session information specific to ATM.

           are UNIQUE and non-overlapping.  For example,
           for a specific LDP Entity index, there could
           be one entry having LowerBound vpi/vci == 0/32, and
           UpperBound vpi/vci == 0/100, and a second entry
           for this same interface with LowerBound
           vpi/vci == 0/101 and UpperBound vpi/vci == 0/200.
           However, there could not be a third entry with
           LowerBound vpi/vci == 0/200 and
           UpperBound vpi/vci == 0/300 because this label
           range overlaps with the second entry (i.e. both
           entries now have 0/200).

           A row will not be created unless a unique and
           non-overlapping range is specified.  Thus, row
           creation implies a one-shot row creation of
           LDP EntityID and LowerBound vpi/vci and
           UpperBound vpi/vci.  At least one label

4.2.  The MPLS-LDP-FRAME-RELAY-MIB Module

   This MIB Module MUST be supported if LDP uses FRAME RELAY as the
   Layer 2 media.  There are three tables in this MIB Module.  Two
   tables are to configure LDP for using Frame Relay.  These tables are
   the mplsLdpEntityFrameRelayParmsTable and the
   mplsLdpEntityFrameRelayLabelRangeTable.

   The mplsLdpEntityFrameRelayParmsTable provides a way to configure
   information which would be contained in the "Optional Parameter"
   portion of an LDP PDU Initialization Message.

   The mplsLdpEntityFrameRelayLabelRangeTable provides a way to
   configure information which would be contained in the "Frame Relay
   Label Range Components" portion of an LDP PDU Intialization Message,
   see [RFC3034] and [RFC3036].


4.2.1.  The LDP Frame Relay Session Table

   The MPLS LDP Frame Relay Session Table is a read-only table which
   contains session information specific to Frame Relay.

           is an optional parameter in the Initialization Message.

              unidirectional VC capability, meaning a given DLCI may appear
              in a label mapping for one direction on the link only.  When
              either or both of the peers specifies unidirectional VC
              capability, both LSRs use unidirectional VC label assignment

4.3.  The MPLS-LDP-GENERIC-MIB Module

   This MIB Module MUST be supported if LDP uses a Per Platform Label
   Space.  This MIB Module contains a Label Range (LR) table for
   configuring Mpls Generic Label Ranges.  This table is
   mplsLdpEntityGenericLabelRangeTable.  Although the LDP Specification
   does not provide a way for configuring Label Ranges for Generic
   Labels, the MIB does provide a way to reserve a range of generic
   labels because this was thought to be useful by the working group.

5.  Revision History

   NOTE TO RFC-Editor:  before publishing this document as an RFC,
   please remove this Revision History (change log) section.  sp

5.1.  Changes from <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-mib-09.txt>

   Added the new MIB boiler plate and associated MIB reference changes.

   Reworked the OID tree structure so that the Modules only have the
   mplsMIB subid dependency.  This was discussed in mpls wg email
   (discussion was mostly between Bert, Tom and Joan).

   Added IANA Considerations section.  This contains 4 subsections, one
   per MIB module.

   Updated and added new references as needed.

   Changed mplsMIB subid values to agree with the latest "Multiprotocol
   Label Switching (MPLS) Management Overview" document, [MPLSMGMT].

   Moved MIB modules around so that they would appear in subId order.
   The Generic MIB module is shown last, since the subid is 7 (which is
   the last (and largest) subid requested by IANA.



5.1.1.  Changes based on MIB Doctor Review Comments

   The following changes are based on comments from the MIB DR Review.
   The comments are from email to the mpls working group dated, Dec 6,
   2002.  These comments are quoted and prefaced by "REQ: comment goes
   here", and then followed by our resolution.

   "REQ: - missing IPR section".  RSP: it has been added.

   "REQ: - Security considerations probably needs more work
     Security ADs want you to explain what the vulnerabilities/risks
     are and what to do against them.
     Also for read only objects, pls list each (group of) object(s)
     and explain what sensitivity attributes they have".  RSP: Done. We
   added subsections here since the Security template is MIB Module
   based and it seemed to us more clear to do a subsection per MIB
   Module.

   "REQ: - pls do the consistency checking for descriptors and all

   that".  RSP: believe this to be done.  Changed Gen to Generic
   everywhere, changed Fr to FrameRelay, changed RO to ReadOnly.
   Changed Sessions to Ses everywhere.  Reviewed tables to make sure
   they were prefixed consistently.  Added more references, used more
   TCs and other stuff.

   "REQ: - sect 3.5 1st sentence, s/would be/are/ ??".  RSP: done.

   "REQ: - sect 3.5 2nd para first sentence  s/initiation/initiate/ ".
   RSP: done.

   "REQ: - section 3.5.2 s/mpsl/mpls/".  RSP: done.

   "REQ: - mplsXxxIndexNext
     See my comments on FTN MIB and LSR MIB on these type of objects
     Best to use something aka rfc3289 ".    RSP: We have imported the
   IndexInteger and IndexIntegerNextFree TCs (from rfc3289.txt).  NOTE:
   we do not like the names of these TCs because they use the term
   Integer when the values are Unsigned32.  Would prefer new TCs with
   IndexUnsigned32 and IndexUnsigned32NextFree.

   "REQ:- RowStatus and StorageType objects
     see my comments about similar objects in LSR MIB
     for StorageType might also want to add a DEFVAL ".    RSP: Added
   descriptive text to the RowStatus objects to specify which columns
   can be changed when row is active.  Added descriptive text to the
   StorageType objects to specify what happens when the StorageType is
   permanent.  Also added DEFVALs for the StorageType objects.

   "REQ: - mplsLdpNotifications ... { mplsLdpMib 2 }
     why not { mplsLdpMib 0} so that it is right away the prefix?
     I believe LSR MIB does it that way now. You may want to do
     it consistently for all notifications.
     I can live with either way, but prefer them to be shorter OIDs.".
   RSP: We changed this to follow what LSR MIB does (i.e.
   mplsLdpNotifications 0) for shorter OIDs..PP "REQ: -
   mplsXxxLastChange
     does that time stamp only get changed if an addition/deletion takes
     place? Not if something gets changed via a SNMP SET command?
     I think I'd prefer to also see changes (modifications) via SET.
     But in any event, be very explicit about if those are included or
     not.".    RSP:  All Last change object DESCRIPTIONs have been
   updated to be very specific.

   "REQ:- mplsLdpLspType
     All that stuff in the DESCRIPTION clause is just a repeat of the

     TC DESCRIPTION clause. Seems not needed to me. What if a value
     gets added later... how do you stay in sync?".    RSP: This has
   been fixed.

   "REQ: - mplsFecAddrLength
     Should that be of SYNTAX InetAddressPrefixLength as per RFC3291?".
   RSP: yes, fixed.

   "REQ: - mplsFecAddrFamily and mplsFecAddr
     These are strange. The DESCRIPTIONS are certainly not meeting the
     requirements as specified in RFC3291. At other places you do it
     correct, so you do understand what is required I think.". RSP:
   changed to have a better descriptions.  Should note that the TLVs in
   the LDP Specification use Address Family Numbers and are still
   referring to RFC1700.

   "REQ: - mplsLdpLspFecTable claims to be a read-only table.
     Yet you have a read-create RowStatus object in it.".    RSP: fixed.

   "REQ: - mplsLdpSessionUp and mplsLdpSessionDown
     Is it not better to just have one notification, namely a
     mplsLdpSessionStateChange and then the mplsLdpSesState object will
     explain what the change is?".    RSP:  We prefer to leave it this
   way. There are some 3rd Party applications that try to resolve
   Notifications, so you see one for down, then resolve this by seeing
   another one for up.  Granted, these 3rd party apps could be coded to
   parse the varbind within the trap, but then this requires coding
   whereas having 2 distinct notifications is easier on the developer.
   Granted, this maybe makes the MIB design more cumbersome.  If this is
   a blocking issue, then we will change it.

   "REQ:- COMPLIANCE section. I hope that INT ADs are OK with making
   IPv6
     addresses optional. Is that cause current LDP only supports IPv4?
     If so you may want to add that as an explanation.".    RSP: IPv6
   was made mandatory, also supported in MPLS LDP Spec (rfc3036.txt).

   Continue with MIB Dr Comments for the MPLS-LDP-GENERIC-MIB.

   "REQ:- same on mplsXXXIndexNext and RowStatus and STorageType
   objects".    RSP: These hdescriptions have been updated.  It should
   be noted, that these should be EXACTLY the same as the
   mplsLdpEntityTable since the LabelRange Tables extend the Entity
   Table.  "REQ:- this looks wierd:
       ::= { mplsMib 6 } -- to be assigned

       -- to be assigned by IANA
     and write something about it in an IANA Considerations Section if
     this is what you want.".    RSP: Added more comments, and added an
   IANA Considerations Section.  "REQ:- mplsGenModuleROCompliance
     I would call it mplsGenModuleReadOnlyCompliance
     You have used ReadOnly and Full in other places/mib modules and
     it is good to be clear and consistent".    RSP: done.

   MIB Doctor Review comments for ATM.

   "REQ:- s/Moduel/Module/".    RSP: done.

   "REQ:- same on mplsXXXIndexNext and RowStatus and STorageType
   objects".    RSP: done.

   "REQ:- this looks wierd:
       ::= { mplsMib 4 } -- to be assigned
     use cc instead of 4 if you want IANA to assign, and do tell
       -- to be assigned by IANA
     and write something about it in an IANA Considerations Section if
     this is what you want.".    RSP: done.

   "REQ:- See earlier remark on Notifications (use zero instead of 2
   right away)".    RSP:Removed this branch because there aren't any
   notifications in this MIB module.

   "REQ:- There are still some INTEGER enumerations that start with zero
     It is not a BLOCKING problem... but if acceptable, pls make it
   start
     at 1 (as you have done vor various others of these enumerations)".
   RSP: We would rather leave these enums starting with zero. (There are
   2 of them in the ATM Module).  The reason for leaving them is because
   the value zero is what the protocol uses.  We have added REFERENCES
   to these objects and more info in the descriptions themselves.  We
   believe it is in the best interest of developers to start enums at
   zero.  The INET-ADDRESS-MIB uses the value zero, and since we are
   already required to use that MIB, there is precedence for zero in an
   enum where it makes sense.  We believe the value of zero makes sense
   for where it is being used in this MIB module.

   "REQ:- mplsXxxxROCompliance  -> better mplsXxxxReadOnlyCompliance".
   RSP: done.

   "REQ:- some formatting problems with DEFVAL lines being split on 2
   lines?".    RSP: fixed.

   statement was added about this.  Also, used the DLCI TC from
   rfc2115.txt to make this more clear.  NOTE: the MPLS-LDP-ATM-MIB
   module uses an index of the VP which can also take on the value of
   zero.  A statement was added to this Index also.  "REQ:-

   done.



5.2.  Changes from <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-mib-08.txt>

   The following changes are from the IESG MIB review.

   Changed "Label Switch Router" to "Label Switching Router".

   Spelling errors fixed (unlabelled, atttempt, subsytem).

   Changed some of the enums to start at 1, instead of zero:
   mplsLdpPeerLoopDetectionForPV and mplsLdpEntityOperStatus.

   Added REFERENCE clauses.

   Added a timestamp object for mplsLdpSesState changes.

   Changed NMS to command generator as defined in RFC2571.

   Added a lastChange objects: mplsLdpEntityLastChange and
   mplsLdpPeerLastChange.

   Added TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONS for MplsLabelDistributionMethod and
   MplsRetentionMode.  These TCs have been incorporated into draft-ietf-
   mpls-tc-mib-04.txt.

   Divided up the one MIB MODULE into 3 additional modules for a total
   of 4 MIB MODULES: 1) mplsLdpMIB, 2) mplsLdpGenericMIB which includes
   objects pertaining to Ethernet as the L2, 3) mplsLdpAtmMIB which
   includes objects pertaining to ATM as the L2, and 4)
   mplsLdpFrameRelayMIB which includes objects pertaining to Frame Relay
   as the L2.

   Also, reduced the number of objects by creating the mplsLdpLspTable
   and removing the Mapping tables.

   In section 3.1 changed "where each row in the table initiates" to
   "where each row in the table represents".

   Updated Reference Section and divided them into Normative vs.
   Informative.

   Removed the MplsGenAddress TC and used the INET-ADDRESS-MIB's
   InetAddress TC.  Objects using this TC are:

   mplsLdpEntityTargetPeerAddr, mplsFecAddr, and
   mplsLdpSesPeerNextHopAddr and are noted in the conformance statements
   supporting: unknown(0), ipv4(1), and ipv6(2).

   Removed AddressFamilyNumbers TC and used InetAddressType TC from the
   INET-ADDRESS-MIB.  One of the MIB compilers as a warning because
   apparently one is expected to use InetAddressType and InetAddress
   together (although, think this restriction is too restrictive). Also,
   removed the reference for the Address Family Numbers MIB.

   Changed the name TargPeer to TargetPeer.

   Removed the Enable/Disable trap objects:
   mplsLdpEntityPVLMisTrapEnable, and mplsLdpSesUpDownTrapEnable.  RFC
   2573 should be used to eable/disable traps.

   Removed the import for "transmission" and instead, imported "mplsMIB
   from the MPLS-TC-MIB".

   Changed mplsLdpEntityPVL to mplsLdpEntityPathVectorLimit and updated
   the DESCRIPTION clause.  Also, the PVL abbreviation was expanded to
   PathVectorLimit for other objects.

   Combined the objects: mplsLdpPeerLoopDectionForPV and mplsLdpPeerPVL
   into one object: mplsLdpPeerPathVectorLimit and updated the
   DESCRIPTION clause.

   mplsLdpEntityTcpDscPort uses InetPortNumber TC from the INET-ADDRESS-
   MIB.  Likewise, mplsLdpEntityUdpDscPort uses the InetPortNumber TC
   from the INET-ADDRESS-MIB.  Also a REFERENCE clause was added.

   The mplsLdpEntityMaxPduLength object has the SYNTAX range changed to
   start at 256.  Also the DESCRIPTION clause was updated.

   The mplsLdpSesMaxPduLen object's name was changed to
   mplsLdpSesMaxPduLength and a UNITS clause was added, and the
   DESCRIPTION clause was updated.  This object is related to the
   mplsLdpEntityMaxPduLength object.

   The mplsLdpEntityKeepAliveHoldTimer and mplsLdpEntityHelloHoldTimer
   DESCRIPTION clause was changed from "The two octet value" to "The
   16-bit integer value".

   The mplsLdpEntityHelloHoldTimer object's DESCRIPTION clause was
   updated.

INTERNET-DRAFT                MPLS LDP MIB                    April 2003


   A range of Integer32(0..100) was added to the SYNTAX clause of the
   mplsLdpEntityInitSesThreshold object.  Also, the DESCRIPTION clause
   of this object was updated.

   The mplsLdpEntityOptionalParameters object was renamed to
   mplsLdpEntityLabelType.

   Updated the mplsLdpEntityAdminStatus and mplsLdpEntityRowStatus
   objects.  RowStatus now reflects the status of the row, and Admin
   status controls enabling/disabling the entry.

   Updated the DESCRIPTION clauses for the objects in the
   mplsLdpEntityStatsTable to refer to the
   mplsLdpEntityDiscontinuityTime object.

   Changed StorType to StorageType.


5.3.  Changes from <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-mib-07.txt>

   There were three types of changes:  the first change was that all the
   MPLS Textual Conventions from this MIB, the LSR and MPLS-TE MIBs were
   moved into a new document [MPLSTCMIB], "draft-ietf-mpls-tc-
   mib-00.txt".  The Textual Conventions are now IMPORTED from
   [MPLSTCMIB].  The second type of change was updates based on comments
   from the IESG.  These changes will be discussed below.  The third
   type of changes were based on minor editorial changes from the co-
   authors.

   The "Introduction" and "Structure of the MIB" sections were reworded
   since they were repetitive.

   The "Overview" was rearranged.

   References were added to "The LDP Entity ATM Objects" and "The LDP
   Entity Frame Relay Objects" Sections.

   The Working Group mailing list and Chairs were added to the CONTACT-
   INFO.

   Updated the DESCRIPTION clause for the "mplsLdpEntityLdpId" object.

   Updated the mplsLdpEntityProtocolVersion to include a range
   (1..65535).

   Updated the "References" Section.

   Running the MIB through the smilint MIB compiler showed that some
   object names were longer than 32 characters, these were shortened to
   32 characters or fewer.

   The following changes were from the co-authors.

   Other minor editorial changes such as fixing typographical errors,
   and removing MIB comments which are no longer meaningful.

   Page 17 (also page 46) the description was enhanced to describe the
   version field in the LDP header from RFC3036.

   Removed WellKnown from the tcp and upd port names.  It's the ports
   that get set, and the default value is the well known (actually the
   registered) port number.

   mplsLdpEntityInitSesTrapEnable object is useless and was removed
   since setting mplsLdpEntityInitSesThreshold=0 acheives the same
   thing.  Also removed it from the descriptive text in section 3.

   Page 47, mplsLdpSessionDiscontinuityTime The initial value of this
   was changed to be sysUpTime instead of zero.  sysUpTime for when the
   session starts is more meaningful and was added to the Session
   Up/Down Traps also.  Also, added the Session specific stats to the
   up/down traps.


5.4.  Changes from <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-mib-06.txt>

   All changes were from the second last call which took place Thursday,
   July 20th, until Thursday, July 27th, 2000 and are described in the
   remainder of this section.

   Remove the reference to the MPLS framework document.

   Add an mplsFecIndexNext type of object.

   Change the conformance of the FEC table objects to be part of the
   mplsLdpGeneralGroup.

   The mplsLdpEntityConfGenericTable is no longer needed because the
   functionality has been absorbed by the
   mplsLdpEntityConfGenericLabelRangeTable.  The
   mplsLdpEntityConfGenericTable has been removed and the front section
   was updated accordingly.

5.5.  Changes from <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-mib-05.txt>

   The majority of changes in this revision are based on Last Call
   comments which were received during the last call from Thursday,
   March 9, 2000 to Friday, March 17, 2000, or slightly thereafter.
   Also, changes were made to agree with the latest specifications.
   These changes are described in this section.

   Changes due to draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-07.txt and draft-ietf-mpls-
   ldp-08.txt. Specifically, removing references to IPv4/IP and using
   router id, as appropriate.

   Removed vpMerge and vpAndVcMerge choices from the object,
   mplsLdpEntityAtmMergeCap.  VP Merge is not described in [RFC3036].

   The LIB Table was removed and replaced by mapping tables to map LDP
   LSPs created by LDP sessions to the mplsInSegment, mplsOutSegment and
   mplsXC  tables in the LSR MIB.  The conformance section was updated
   to include a Mapping Group which is to be implemented iff these LSR
   MIB tables (mplsInSegmentTable, mplsOutSegmentTable and mplsXCTable)
   are implemented.

   The front section was updated to include information on the Generic
   label table.

   Added more in the front section on on Row
   Creation/adminStatus/OperStatus in the LDP Entity and related tables.

   Added a generic label range table. NOTE: there is NO corresponding
   LDP message which relates to the information in this table, however,
   this table does provide a way for a user to 'reserve' a generic label
   range.

   A new TEXTUAL-CONVENTION, MplsAtmVcIdentifier was added.  This TC has
   the same upper bounds as AtmVcIdentifier (from rfc2514) except that
   the lower bound is 32 (and not 0).  The lower bound is 32 since this
   value is specified by [RFC3035].

   Removed the scalar object mplsLsrLabelRetentionMode and added
   mplsLdpEntityLabelRetentionMode.  The change was made to allow
   configuring the retention mode on a per LDP Entity basis, as opposed
   for the entire LSR.

   Typo in section 3.5.2 was fixed.

   Typo in the mplsLdpSessionUp notification description was fixed.

   Section 'LDP Notifications' was expanded to cover both the
   'mplsLdpSessionUp' and 'mplsLdpSessionDown' traps.  Also, the objects
   which enable and disable these traps have been described in this
   Section:

   The 'mplsLdpEntityHopCountLoopDetection' object and the
   'mplsLdpEntityHopCount' object have been combined into the new
   object, 'mplsLdpEntityHopCountLimit'.

   MplsLabel has been updated to reflect the VPI value of 12 bits and
   not 8.

   Added DEFVAL clause to the 'mplsLdpEntityWellKnownDiscoveryPort'
   object.  The default value is 646.

   Added UNITS and DEFVAL clauses to the 'mplsLdpEntityMaxPduLength'
   object.  The default value is 4096 and the units is octets.

   Added DEFVAL clause to 'mplsLdpEntityProtocolVersion' object.  The
   default value is 1.

    Added DEFVAL clause to 'mplsLdpEntityKeepAliveHoldTimer' of 40
   seconds.

   Added DEFVAL clause to 'mplsLdpEntityInitSesThreshold' object.  The
   default value is 8.

   The mplsLdpEntityWellKnownDiscoveryPort was changed into two objects,
   one for TCP and one for UDP.  The names are

   The mplsLdpEntityPeerTable was (re-)named mplsLdpPeerTable.  The
   mplsLdpSessionTable now AUGMENTs the mplsLdpPeerTable in order to

   to the mplsLdpSessionEntry description and to the description for the
   mplsLdpPeerTable.

5.6.  Changes from <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-mib-04.txt>

   Editorial changes, fixing typo's, fixing wrapping lines, etc.

   Updated references for latest drafts, and added [RFC3032] and
   [RFC3034] to Reference Section.

   Added to the Acknowledgements Section.

   Changed the SYNTAX and DESCRIPTION of the
   'mplsLdpLsrLoopDetectionCapable' object, so that it will also support
   the loop detection by hop count.

   Combined the 'mplsLdpEntityLoopDetectionForPV' and 'mplsLdpEntityPVL'
   objects.  The functionality of the 'mplsLdpEntityLoopDectionForPV' is
   now denoted by the value of 0 (zero) in the 'mplsLdpEntityPVL'
   object.  This results in one less object
   'mplsLdpEntityLoopDectionForPV' but does not sacrifice functionality.

   Changed 'mplsLdpLibLabelType' into two objects:
   'mplsLdpLibInLabelType' and differ from the egress label type.  The
   MIB now reflects this.

   The following items were changed as a result of the Frame Relay Forum
   dropping support for 17-bit DLCIs:  the MplsLabel TC description has
   been modified, and other Frame Relay Object descriptions were also
   modified (as specified in this section).

   The MplsLabel TC was also modified and reference 3. was added to the
   REFERENCE Clause.

   MplsLdpLabelTypes TC was modified to use an enum.

   InterfaceIndex support was added to the Entity information.  This was
   specifically requested by several members of the working group.  An
   additional table, mplsLdpEntityConfGenericTable as a way to configure
   Generic Labels, and an object, 'mplsLdpConfGenericIfIndexOrZero was
   added to map the InterfaceIndex used by Generic Labels.  Objects were
   also added to the 'mplsLdpEntityAtmParmsTable' and the and
   'mplsLdpEntityFrIfIndex', respectively.

   Changed the name of the 'mplsLdpEntityMtu' object to be
   'mplsLdpEntityMaxPduLength' which is more consistent with the LDP
   Specification.  Also, the description and SYNTAX were changed.

   Changed the SYNTAX of the 'mplsLdpSessionMaxPduLength' to unsigned32

   and changed the Range from (0..65535) to (1..65535).

   Added and improved the front section discussion on SNMP
   Notifications.

   Also, modified the DESCRIPTION clause of the

   Added objects to enable/disable the sending of traps:

   Added an object to enable/disable sending traps for Sessions changing
   from Up to Down, or Down to Up.

   Added notifications to generate traps from session changing from Up
   to Down, or Down to up.

   Added a StorageType object to the Entity and associated tables which
   are configurable.

   Added a Discontinuity Time object to the Entity Table,

   Added discussion on row creation in the Entity and other associated
   Entity tables.  This is a new Section in the Front part of the
   document called:

   Removed the 'mplsLdpEntityControlMethod'.

   Made 'mplsLdpFecLspId' as part of the INDEX for the FEC table.  This
   is to allow FECs to map to multiple LSPs.  Also add a RowPointer to a
   row in the Session Table.

   Added an operation status object, 'mplsLdpLspOperStatus' and a last
   Change object, 'mplsLdpLspLastChangeto the LIB Table.  This will be
   used to detect whether an LSP has changed its status.

   Changed the name of the mplsLdpPeerTable to the
   mplsLdpEntityPeerTable.  This table contains information relevant to
   Peers which are known to specific Entities.  The indexing of this
   table has also changed to include the Row in the Entity Table that
   this Peer is known by.  The mplsLdpHelloAdjacencyTable and the
   mplsLdpSessionTable have been moved under this table.  Since Hello
   Adjacencies are related to Entity-Peer information and Sessions are
   related to Entity-Peer information this was seen as a comprehensive
   and coherent modelling.  Associated descriptions in the front section
   and in the tables have been changed to reflect this change.

   Moved the 'mplsLdpConfFrLen' object from the

   'mplsLdpEntityConfFrLabelRangeTable' to the
   'mplsLdpEntityFrameRelayParmsTable' since the Frame Relay
   interface/port can only use one header length at a time, i.e. a
   specific FR interface supports one address length for all VCs on that
   interface.  Also, changed the object so that it only supports 10 and
   23 bit DLCI lengths. (The 17 bit length was dropped by the Frame
   Relay Forum and thus, is no longer required.)  The name of this
   object was changed from 'mplsLdpConfFrLen' to 'mplsLdpEntityFrLen' to
   fit in with the 'mplsLdpEntityFrameRelayParmsTable'.

   Removed the seventeenDlciBits(1) value from the mplsLdpFrSessionLen
   object.  (The 17 bit length was dropped by the Frame Relay Forum and
   thus, is no longer required.)

   Corrected the range of the 'mplsLdpEntityIndexNext' object to include
   0 (zero).


5.7.  Changes from <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-mib-03.txt>

   Reworded the description of the mplsLdpAtmSessionTable to clarify
   that one or MORE label range intersection(s) is/are represented in
   this table.

   Reworded the description of the mplsLdpFrameRelaySessionTable to
   clarify that one or MORE label range intersection(s) is/are
   represented in this table.

   Added a new index, mplsLdpSessionPeerIndex, to the
   mplsLdpSessionPeerAddressTable.  This new index uniquely identifies
   the entry within a given session.  (Since  adding
   mplsLdpSessionPeerNextHopAddressType,
   mplsLdpSessionPeerNextHopAddress to the INDEX clause of the
   mplsLdpSessionPeerAddressTable leaves a table with only indices and
   no objects, the work around was to add a new index which uniquely
   differentiates an entry within a given session.)

   Quite a few changes to the mplsLdpPeerTable.  First, removed the
   mplsLdpPeerIndex from the mplsLdpPeerTable and other tables.  This
   index served no purpose, so was removed.  Second, removed the
   objects: mplsLdpPeerInternetworkAddrType, and
   mplsLdpPeerInternetworkAddr.  Third, reworded the description of this
   table to include information which is known during Session
   Intialization attempts, the specific information has to do with Loop
   Dection based on Path Vectors.  Since Section 3.5.3 of the LDP Spec
   when describing the PVLim says: "Although knowledge of a peer's path

   LSR to alert an operator to a possible misconfiguration." and the
   object mplsLdpPeerPVL is sent as a varbind in the mplsLdpPVLMismatch
   notification.

   Removed the mplsLdpPeerIndex from the mplsLdpHelloAdjacencyTable.

   Removed the "IANA Address Family Numbers" MIB section.

   Updated the boiler.me from the ops web page dated Weds., Dec 22,
   1999.

   Updated the Security Section from the ops web page.

   Added the following objects to the mplsLdpEntityTable:
   mplsLdpEntityControlMethod, mplsLdpEntityLoopDectionForPV, and
   mplsLdpEntityPathVectorLimit.

   Removed mplsLdpSessionLabelAdvertisement,
   mplsLdpSessionLoopDetectionForPV, and mplsLdpSessionPathVectorLimit
   from the mplsLdpSessionTable.

   Changed the mplsLdpPathVectorLimitMismatch Notification to send
   mplsLdpEntityPathVectorLimit (instead of
   mplsLdpSessionPathVectorLimit).

   Copied the MplsLabel TC from draft-ietf-mpls-lsr-mib-00.txt and
   replaced the MplsLdpGenAddr for mplsLdpLibInLabel and
   mplsLdpLibOutLabel with MplsLabel.

   The mplsLdpSessionIndex was removed throughout the MIB.  This was
   replaced by the object mplsLdpSessionDiscontinuityTime.  The
   motivation was to reduce the number of indices.

   The descriptions for the objects in the mplsLdpSessionStatsTable,
   mplsLdpSessionStatsUnknownMessageTypeErrors and
   mplsLdpSessionStatsUnknownTlvErrors, have been updated to include a
   reference to the mplsLdpSessionDiscontinuityTime object.

   mplsLdpEntityOperStatus, mplsLdpEntityTargetedPeer,
   mplsLdpEntityTargetedPeerAddrType, mplsLdpEntityTargetedPeerAddr, and
   mplsLdpEntityHelloHoldTimer.

   Changed the description of the mplsLdpEntityAtmParmsTable and added
   the following objects to this table: mplsLdpEntityAtmLsrConnectivity,
   mplsLdpEntityDefaultControlVpi, mplsLdpEntityDefaultControlVci,
   mplsLdpEntityUnlabTrafVpi, and mplsLdpEntityUnlabTrafVci.  NOTE:  the
   last four objects were in Version 01 of the MIB but were mistakenly
   omitted from Version 02. Now, they are back.

   Changed the indexing of the mplsLdpEntityConfAtmLabelRangeTable to
   include the minimum VPI/VCI.  This is to ensure that indices in this
   table are unique.

   Changed the indexing of the mplsLdpEntityConfFrLabelRangeTable, to
   include the minimum DLCI value.  This is to ensure that indices in
   this table are unique.

   Added [RFC3036] to Reference Section.


5.9.  Changes from <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-mib-01.txt>

   The MIB was updated to correspond to draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-06.txt of
   the LDP Specification [RFC3036].

   The front section was updated.

   The MIB was made to be less ATM-centric.  Essentially, the ATM
   specific objects where removed from the tables and placed in ATM
   specific Tables.  A type was added to the base tables and a row is to
   be created in the ATM/FR/etc.  type table.  Apropos compliance
   statements were added to reflect the separation of ATM and Frame
   Relay objects into their respective tables.

   Objects for Loop Detection were removed from describing the LDP
   implementation (i.e. the scalars were removed) and Loop Dection
   objects were added to the Session Table.  (Although as the LDP
   Specification indicates loop detection should be for an LSR within a
   domain.)

   The following tables were added:  mplsLdpEntityAtmParmsTable,
   mplsLdpEntityConfAtmLabelRangeTable, mplsLdpFrameRelayParmsTable,
   mplsLdpConfFrLabelRangeTable, mplsLdpAtmSessionTable,

   mplsLdpFrameRelaySessionTable, mplsLdpSessionPeerAddressTable,
   mplsLdpLibTable, and the mplsLdpFecTable.

   The following notifications were added:  notification for Session
   removal.

   The following objects were removed from the Session Table:
   mplsLdpSessionRole was removed (this can be determined by comparing
   LSR Ids and does not need to be explicitly in the MIB.)  ATM specific
   objects (mplsLdpSessionAtmLabelRangeLowerBoundVpi
   mplsLdpSessionAtmLabelRangeLowerBoundVci,
   mplsLdpSessionAtmLabelRangeUpperBoundVpi
   mplsLdpSessionAtmLabelRangeUpperBoundVci) were removed and put into a
   separate table.  Frame Relay objects were added in a separate table.

   Hello Adjacency Table was updated.

   The objects, mplsLdpSessionRejectedParamErrors,
   mplsLdpSessionRejectedNoHelloErrors, mplsLdpBadLdpIdentifierErrors,
   mplsLdpBadPduLengthErrors, mplsLdpBadMessageLengthErrors,
   mplsLdpBadTlvLengthErrors, mplsLdpMalformedTlvValueErrors,
   mplsLdpKeepAliveTimerExpiredErrors, mplsLdpShutdownNotifReceived, and
   mplsLdpShutdownNotifSent were added to the mplsLdpEntityStatsTable.

   The mplsLdpSessionStatsTable was added to count statics based on a
   per Session basis.

   The mplLdpPeerConfAtmLabelRangeTable has been removed.  There is no
   need to configure information for a Peer.  All information for a peer
   is learned, thus peer information is read-only.

   (Editorial) References were updated to reflect the documents which
   this version was based on.


5.10.  Changes from <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-mib-00.txt>

   Textual conventions were added for the LSR Identifier and the LDP
   Identifier.

   Top-level mib structure was added. The LDP MIB falls under a proposed
   hierarchy of mpls.mplsProtocols.

   The mib hierarchy within the LDP MIB was also changed.  A new branch,

9.1.  Security Considerations for MPLS-LDP-MIB

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their

   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o    the mplsLdpEntityTable contains objects to provision potential
        LDP sessions on the Label Switching Router (LSR) or Label Edge
        Router (LER).   The mplsLdpLspFecTable contains objects which
        associate an LSP with a FEC.  Unauthorized access to objects in
        these tables, could result in disruption of traffic on the
        network.  This is especially true if an LDP session has been
        established.  The use of stronger mechanisms such as SNMPv3
        security should be considered where possible.  Specifically,
        SNMPv3 VACM and USM MUST be used with any v3 agent which
        implements this MIB.  Administrators should consider whether
        read access to these objects should be allowed, since read
        access may be undesirable under certain circumstances.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module "i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible" may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o    the mplsLdpEntityTable, mplsLdpPeerTable, mplsLdpSesTable and
        mplsLdpSesStatsTable collectively show the LDP LSP network
        topology.  If an Administrator does not want to reveal the LDP
        LSP topology of the network, then these tables should be
        considered sensitive/vulnerable.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure "for example by using IPSec",
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET "read/change/create/delete" the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework "see [RFC3410], section 8",
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms "for
   authentication and privacy".

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals "users" that have legitimate

9.2.  Security Considerations for MPLS-LDP-ATM-MIB

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o    the mplsLdpEntityAtmTable and mplsLdpEntityAtmLRTable contain
        objects to provision potential LDP sessions on the Label
        Switching Router (LSR) or Label Edge Router (LER) over Layer 2
        of ATM.  These tables extend the mplsLdpEntityTable in the MPLS-
        LDP-MIB.  Unauthorized access to objects in these tables, could
        result in disruption of traffic on the network.  This is
        especially true if an LDP session has been established.  The use
        of stronger mechanisms such as SNMPv3 security should be
        considered where possible.  Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and USM
        MUST be used with any v3 agent which implements this MIB.
        Administrators should consider whether read access to these
        objects should be allowed, since read access may be undesirable
        under certain circumstances.

   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o    the mplsLdpEntityAtmTable and mplsLdpEntityAtmLRTable show the
        Label Ranges for ATM.  If an Administrator does not want to
        reveal this information then these tables should be considered
        sensitive/vulnerable and treated accordingly.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure "for example by using IPSec",
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET "read/change/create/delete" the objects
   in this MIB module.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o    the mplsLdpEntityFrameRelayTable and
        mplsLdpEntityFrameRelayLRTable contain objects to provision
        potential LDP sessions on the Label Switching Router (LSR) or
        Label Edge Router (LER) over Layer 2 of Frame Relay.  These
        tables extend the mplsLdpEntityTable in the MPLS-LDP-MIB.
        Unauthorized access to objects in these tables, could result in
        disruption of traffic on the network.  This is especially true
        if an LDP session has been established.  The use of stronger

9.4.  Security Considerations for MPLS-LDP-GENERIC-MIB

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure

   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

        Label Edge Router (LER) over Layer 2 of Ethernet.  This table
        extends the mplsLdpEntityTable in the MPLS-LDP-MIB.
        Unauthorized access to objects in these tables, could result in
        disruption of traffic on the network.  This is especially true
        if an LDP session has been established.  The use of stronger

10.  IANA Considerations

   As described in [MPLSMGMT] and as stated in the MPLS-TC-MIB
   [MPLSTCMIB], MPLS related standards track MIB modules should be
   rooted under the mplsMIB subtree.  There are 4 MPLS MIB Modules
   contained in this document, each of the following "IANA
   Considerations" subsections requests IANA for a new assignment under
   the mplsMIB subtree.  New assignments can only be made via a
