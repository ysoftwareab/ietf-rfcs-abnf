1. Abstract

This draft proposes a mechanism that allows an  incremental deployment
of IPv6 inside an IPv4 AS. It aims at automatically set up tunnels,
using EGP standard capabilities, in order to gradually introduce IPv6
connectivity within an initially IPv4 AS. From a scope point of view,
this technique must be considered as an intermediary between ISATAP and
interdomain techniques ([6to4], [BGP-tunnel]).

The connectivity between IPv6 islands within a domain is obtained by
the introduction of Routing Protocols Gateways (RPG). IPv6-specific
routing information  is transferred over the IPv4 routing
infrastructure and allows the automatic creation of tunnels between the
IPv6 islands.

First, the general mechanism of an RPG is explained. Then, an
instantiation of an RPG for OSPFv2/OSPFv3 is detailed and the structure
of a generic opaque LSA is specified.


2. Conventions and terminology used in this document

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].

Terminology:

o Routing Protocols Gateway RPG
		
A routing protocols gateway is a component able to transfer routing
information (e.g. IPv6 prefixes, metrics...) from a routing protocol to
another one.

3. Introduction


This draft proposes a mechanism that allows an  incremental deployment
of IPv6 inside an IPv4 AS. The mechanism is intended as a transition
tool used during the period of co-existence of IPv4 and IPv6. In a late
transition phase, the same mechanism can be applied to IPv4 islands in
an IPv6 domain.


In this document, an IPv6 island is a connected set of IPv6 nodes
surrounded by an IPv4 network, separated from other IPv6 networks. The
nodes inside an IPv6 island can be IPv6-only nodes, Dual Stack nodes,
or both can be mixed.  Internal nodes should only use their IPv6
capabilities. An island will be connected to the IPv4 routing
infrastructure with dual stack (IPv4/IPv6) routers.




4. Specification 

4.1 General case

   As previously said, this technique of transition is used to provide
 connectivity between IPv6 islands within the same IPv4 AS. The figure
 below illustrates the situation.

                    +--------------------------------+
                    |                                |
                    |   +-------+          +-------+ |
                    |   |IPv6   * -  -  - -* IPv6  | |
                    |   |island |          |island | |
                    |   +-------+          +-------+ |  
                    |                                |
                    |                                |
                    |       IPv4 AS domain           |  
                    +--------------------------------+

    Note : The dual stack routers integrating Routing Protocols gateways
are    represented with "*".

These IPv6 islands are connected to the IPv4 AS with dual stack
(IPv4/IPv6) routers containing an RPG.


RPGs could be developed for a lot of routing protocol combinations:
OSPFv3, ISISv6, etc running in the IPv6 islands and OSPFv2, ISISv4, RIP
in the IPv4 AS domain)

For the moment, we will only consider an RPG  for interconnecting
OSPFv3 and OSPFv2.


4.2 Connecting IPv6 islands running OSPFv3 over an IPv4 AS running OSPFv2.

This case is depicted below:

                    +--------------------------------+
                    |                                |
                    |   +-------+          +-------+ |
                    |   |IPv6   *- - - - - *IPv6   | |
                    |   |island |          |island | |
                    |   |OSPFv3 |          |OSPFv3 | |
                    |   +-------+          +-------+ |  
                    |                                |
                    |                                |
                    |   IPv4 AS domain  (OSPFv2)     |  
                    +--------------------------------+


RPGs transfer specific information  arriving via OSPFv2  to OSPFv3 and
vice versa. In this way, it passes information from one OSPFv3 island
to another OSPFv3 island  crossing one or multiple OSPFv2 areas.


To create tunnels between IPv6 islands the IPv6 prefixes of a particular
island will be passed by OSPFv3 to OSPFv2 via the RPG. The RPG will
construct an OSPFv2 message and will flood it to all other OSPFv2
nodes. An OSPF v2 handling specific routing protocol gateway message
will receive this message and pass it to OSPF v3 via the RPG.

This naturally drives to the definition of an OPAQUE-LSA for OSPF v2
that carries IPv6-specific information. The next section defines a
general opaque LSA format that will be used for this case.

4.3 Definition of a Multi-protocol opaque LSA

As specified in the RFC 2370, opaque LSAs consist of standard LSA
header followed by application specific information.  Opaque LSAs
provide a generalized mechanism to allow for the future extensibility
of OSPF. The information contained in Opaque LSAs may
be used directly by OSPF or indirectly by any application that wishes
information to be distributed throughout the OSPF domain.

   This draft applies for types (10 ,11) of opaque LSAs, according to the
selected scope.

The type 10 is used to connect two islands included in the same area.

The type 11 is used to connect two island included in the same
Autonomous System

   According to the packet format of the opaque LSA given in appendix A.2
of the RFC 2370 :
       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |            LS age             |     Options   |      10 or 11 |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  Opaque Type  |               Opaque ID                       |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                      Advertising Router                       |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                      LS Sequence Number                       |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |         LS checksum           |      Total Length             |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |            AFI                |    SAFI       | orig Rout prot| 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | Type          |  Length       | Value ...                     |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                              ...                              |

the solution is to use:


   o The Opaque Type to define the type of information carried by the
opaque LSA. Its value is registered by IANA. In that case it indicates
that it carries a tunnel end point value and transferred prefixes.

   o The opaque ID field is TBD

   o The AFI and SAFI contains the Address Family and Subsequent Address
  Family Identifiers that are carried by the opaque LSA. It allows to
  carry multi-protocol as defined by MP_BGP. These fields are already
  defined by IANA and are re-used in the opaque LSA, since it fits the
  same purpose.

The AFI and SAFI will express the characteristics of the originating
island.



   o The Originating Routing Protocol (8 bits) specifies the kind and the
 version of the routing protocol running inside the origin islands
 (e.g. OSPF v3,RIPng etc). An opaque LSA contains only one value
 specifying only one routing protocol. The value 0 is used when no IPv6
 routing protocol runs inside the IPv6 island. Other values should be
 defined for the other originating routing protocols.

   o Different TLVs described here under.  

For all TLV, eight bits are used to define Type, 8 bits are used to
define Length.

These TLVs are used:

Type 1: It corresponds to the tunnel end point address. The address
carried is unicast address, with a length corresponding to the address
length (128 for IPv6, 32 for IPV4)

Type 1 is mandatory in this opaque LSA and must appear only once in the
opaque LSA.

Type 2 :

The format of this type is :

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |    Type=2     |TLV Leng=1byte | cost (3 bytes)      ...       |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    | ... cost      | prefix length |    prefix of the island...    |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

This type is used to transfer one prefix of the island with the related
cost. This prefix will be ADDED in the routing database of the remote
island(s). The type 2 is  optional in this opaque LSA. A cost field has
been defined to contain cost from originating routing protocols.  If
AFI = IPV6, the prefix of the island will be encoded in a 128 bits
structure. If AFI = IPV4, the prefix of the island will be encoded in a
32 bits structure.

Type 3: To transfer and withdraw one prefix of the island. This prefix
will be WITHDRAWN in the routing database of the remote IPv6 island.

New TLVs can be added later.

4.4 Role of routing protocols gateways at emission and reception of
opaque LSA


The triggers for the emission of this opaque LSA for OSPF v2 are
implementation dependant and are not tackled in this document.
Nevertheless, the operations that have to be performed at emission and
reception of this opaque LSA are briefly detailed.



4.4.1 Emission of opaque LSA When the application of the IPv6 egress
router decides to send LSAs, it includes all the information inside the
opaque LSA with respect to the framework detailed previously specifying
the opaque ID and, the opaque Type. This opaque LSA is broadcasted
throughout the network (with the related scope).

Emission of WITHDRAWN happens when an OSPF node is not visible anymore.
The RPG is in charge of sending a specific WITHDRAWN with the impacted
prefixes.

4.4.2 Reception of opaque LSA When receiving this kind of opaque LSA, a
tunnel is created with the information given by the opaque LSA : the
TLV Type 1 giving the tunnel end point information and the TLVs Type 2
giving the prefixes information.

The way tunnel can be setup and used is implementation dependant. It can be automatic or configured tunnels.

At reception phase, the same process will be performed when the route
has to be withdrawn. The prefixes are withdrawn from the routing table
and the WITHDRAWN information is flooded into the island.

When reception of these opaque LSA are successfully completed, each
IPv6 island included in this IPv4 AS has the opportunity to communicate
with all the other IPv6 islands included in this AS.


4.4.3 OSPF cost use

In the Type 2 field, a cost has been designed. This field cost needs to
be refined here. Indeed, this field contains a OSPF-based metric, but
with modification due to the cross of different routing protocols.

|   +------------+                          +------------+  |
|   |            |                          |            |  |
|   |           RPG A                     RPG B          |  |
|   |  A...........................*..............................................................................*...............C      |  |
|   |   metric A |      metric B            | metric C   |  |
|   +------------+                          +------------+  |  
|                                                           |
|                  IPV4 AS domain  (OSPFv2)                 |  
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
 
RPG A is a member of IPv6 island A. It is an OSPFv2/v3 router. RPG A
calculates a path toward destination A in IPv6 island A with a cost
equal to metric A. It creates an opaque LSA for advertisement of this
prefix to IPv6 island B. This opaque LSA contains a TLV type 2 with
prefix A and a "metric A". Metric A is an OSPFv3 metric.

RPG B receives this opaque LSA. RPG B calculates a path to RPG A with a
cost equal to metric B: this is an OSPFv2 metric because the path
between RPG B and A crosses the IPv4 domain.

The total cost, from RPG B to RPG A is equal to metric A + metric B.
Since the two metrics come from different origins, the total cost from
RPG B to destination A is set to: metric A + metric B + DELTA. RPG B
advertises this prefix A, within IPv6 island B, with the cost: metric A
+ metric B + DELTA.

DELTA would be a fixed cost that allow to avoid problem when cost that
allow to give the RPG prefixes less specific than home network.


The value of DELTA is TBD: it probably will be a configurable
parameter.

  
+-----------------------------------------------------------+

|   |  A--met AA-*---------metric BA--------*            |  |
|   |   \-met CA-*---------metric BC------ /|            |  | 
|   |           RPG C                       |            |  |
|   +------------+                          +------------+  |  
|                                                           |
|                  IPV4 AS domain  (OSPFv2)                 |  
+-----------------------------------------------------------+

RPG A and RPG C both advertise prefix A with -respectively- metric AA
and metric CA. RPG knows the cost of the path to reach A and C
-respectively BA and BC. The costs of the two paths to A are:

    via RPG A: metric BA + metric AA + DELTA
    via RPG C: metric BC + metric CA + DELTA

RPG B (or any node within island B) can thus decide which of the two
paths is the best one. No loop is introduced and no configuration is
needed. RPG advertises the best of the two paths within IPv6 island B.



4.5 Routers requirements

All the routers present in the IPv4 AS, must be opaque-LSA capable in
order to assure the transfer of the opaque LSAs.


5. IANA Considerations

6. Number for opaque Type need to be registered at IANA 




7. Security considerations

The security mechanisms of the native routing protocols are used.
