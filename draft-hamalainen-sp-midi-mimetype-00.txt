Abstract 
    
   MIDI Manufacturers Association (MMA) and Association of Music 
   Electronics industry (AMEI) have recently produced the Scalable 
   Polyphony MIDI (SP-MIDI) standard [1]. The SP-MIDI standard has been 
   developed in particularly for mobile MIDI applications. SP-MIDI has 
   been approved for 3GPP standardization and a dedicated SP-MIDI 
   profile has been defined for 3GPP SP-MIDI devices [2]. Since MIDI 
   information is a very compact media type 3GPP is initially focusing 
   on the application of SP-MIDI for music downloading and messaging 
   applications that require MIME registration.

1 Introduction 
    
   MIDI content is commonly used in the Internet, however such use is 
   based on informal ad hoc MIME type definitions that have not been 
   registered by IETF. The present MIME type registration is harmonized 
   with the typical Internet usage of unregistered audio/midi and 
   audio/x-midi MIME types. Commonly MIDI information is stored in the 
   Standard MIDI File (SMF) format [3]. The present MIME type 
   registration also uses the SMF file format for the encapsulation of 
   SP-MIDI data. Whereas previous MIDI specifications have been based 
   on common minimum requirements for all playback devices supporting 
   the same specification, SP-MIDI is able to support a wider range of 
   playback devices because playback adaptations can be encoded in the 
   MIDI content. Due to these differences, a separate MIME type, 
   audio/sp-midi, needs to be registered to distinguish SP-MIDI 
   content. 
 
2 Registration of audio/sp-midi 
 
   MIME media type name: audio 
    
   MIME subtype name: sp-midi 
    
   Required parameters: none 
    
   Optional parameters: none 
    
   Encoding considerations:  
         
        sp-midi data is binary data and must be encoded for non-binary 
        transport; Base64 is suitable for Email 
    
   Security considerations: 
         
        Many synthetic audio compositions have associated intellectual 
        property rights. It is conceivable that rights owners of sp-
        midi content will want to protect their rights by applying 
        security mechanisms that prohibit the rendering of the content 
        without a legally acquired license to do so. These mechanisms 
        would be applied externally to the Content-Type defined here; 
        sp-midi content itself is not encrypted internally. sp-midi 
        streams do not contain executable content. 
    
 
   Interoperability considerations: 
         
        Scalable Polyphony MIDI (SP-MIDI) is a Musical Instrument 
        Digital Interface (MIDI) specification developed by MMA and 
        AMEI. SP-MIDI is based on the MIDI 1.0 specification [3] which 
        standardizes a protocol for the electronic transmission of 
        music as data suitable for communication between a transmitter

        and receiver using MIDI messages. SP-MIDI data is stored in 
        Standard MIDI Files (SMF) [3]. 
        The SP-MIDI format [1] provides scalable representation of MIDI 
        content which enables broadly interoperable music applications. 
        SP-MIDI files have encoded information about playback 
        requirements which allows SP-MIDI playback devices with 
        different device capabilities to play the same content 
        according to composerËs polyphony requirement and Channel 
        priority order definitions. SP-MIDI player requirements are 
        defined in separate SP-MIDI profile specifications [2] defining 
        the supported MIDI messages and device requirement. All SP-MIDI 
        profiles follow the definitions of the SP-MIDI specification 
        [1]. 
    
        MMA and AMEI have previously defined the General MIDI (GM) 
        system standards GM1 [4] GM2 [5], and GML [6]. These 
        specifications are technically related to the SP-MIDI 
        specification, but do not support polyphony scalability. Due to 
        the differences between GM and SP-MIDI systems GM synthesizers 
        do not support all SP-MIDI content, and likewise not all SP-
        MIDI synthesizers support all GM content. Thus a separate MIME 
        definition is needed to distinguish SP-MIDI, media from the 
        informally used audio/midi content. 
    
   Published specification: 
    
        There are no previous RFC documents on SP-MIDI.
