Introduction</h3>

<p>The original idea and the name of the mechanism (6rd) specified
   in this document is described in <a class='info' href='#I-D.despres-6rd'>draft-despres-6rd<span> (</span><span class='info'>Despres, R., &ldquo;IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4 infrastructures (6rd),&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.despres&#8209;6rd], which details a
   successful commercial "rapid deployment" of the 6rd mechanism by a
   residential Service Provider and is recommended background
   reading. This document describes the 6rd mechanism, extended for
   use in more general environments, and intended for advancement on
   the IETF Standards Track. Throughout this document, the term 6to4
   is used to refer to the mechanism described in <a class='info' href='#RFC3056'>[RFC3056]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Carpenter, B. and K. Moore, &ldquo;Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> and 6rd the mechanism defined herein.
</p>
<p>6rd specifies a protocol mechanism to deploy IPv6 to sites via a
   Service Provider's (SP's) IPv4 network.  It builds on 6to4 <a class='info' href='#RFC3056'>[RFC3056]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Carpenter, B. and K. Moore, &ldquo;Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>, with the key differentiator that it
   utilizes an SP's own IPv6 address prefix rather than a well known
   prefix (2002::/16). By using the SP's IPv6 prefix, the operational
   domain of 6rd is limited to the SP network and under its direct
   control. From the perspective of customer sites and the IPv6
   Internet at large, the IPv6 service provided is equivalent to
   native IPv6.
</p>
<p>6rd as described in this document relies upon an algorithmic
   mapping between the IPv6 and IPv4 addresses that are assigned for
   use within the SP network.  This mapping allows for automatic
   determination of IPv4 tunnel endpoints from IPv6 prefixes, allowing
   stateless operation of 6rd. 6rd views the IPv4 network as a link
   layer for IPv6 and supports an automatic tunneling abstraction
   similar to the Non-Broadcast Multiple Access (NBMA) model.
</p>
<p>A 6rd domain consists of 6rd Customer Edge (CE) routers and one
   or more 6rd BRs. IPv6 packets encapsulated by 6rd follow the IPv4
   routing topology within the SP network among CEs and BRs. 6rd BRs
   are traversed only for IPv6 packets that are destined to or are
   arriving from outside the SP's 6rd domain. As 6rd is stateless, BRs
   my be reached using anycast for failover and resiliency.
</p>
<p>On the "customer-facing" (i.e., "LAN") side of a CE, IPv6 is
   implemented as it would be for any native IP service delivered by
   the SP. On the "SP-Facing" (i.e., "WAN") side of the 6rd CE, the
   WAN interface itself, encapsulation over Ethernet, ATM or PPP, as
   well as control protocols such as PPPoE, IPCP, DHCP, etc. all
   remain unchanged from current IPv4 operation. Although 6rd was
   designed primarily to support IPv6 deployment to a customer site
   (such as a residential home network) by an SP, it can equally be
   applied to an individual IPv6 host acting as a CE.
</p>
<p>6rd relies on IPv4 and is designed to deliver production-quality
   IPv6 alongside IPv4 with as little change to IPv4 networking and
   operations as possible. Native IPv6 deployment within the SP
   network itself may continue for the SP's own purposes aside of
   delivering IPv6 service to sites supported by 6rd.  Once the SP
   network and operations can support fully native IPv6 access and
   transport, 6rd may be discontinued. IPv4 may then be discontinued
   entirely or tunneled over IPv6 as described in <a class='info' href='#I-D.durand-softwire-dual-stack-lite'>draft-ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite<span> (</span><span class='info'>Durand, A., Droms, R., Haberman, B., and J. Woodyatt, &ldquo;Dual-stack lite broadband deployments post IPv4 exhaustion,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.durand&#8209;softwire&#8209;dual&#8209;stack&#8209;lite].

Terminology</h3>

<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>6rd prefix</dt>
<dd>An IPv6 prefix selected by the Service
       Provider for use by a 6rd domain. There is exactly one 6rd
       Prefix for a given 6rd domain. An SP may deploy 6rd with a
       single 6rd domain or multiple 6rd domains.
</dd>
<dt>6rd Customer Edge</dt>
<dd>A 6rd CE is a device
       functioning as a Customer Edge in a 6rd deployment. In a
       residential broadband deployment this type of device is
       sometimes referred to as a "Residential Gateway (RG)," or
       "Customer Premises Equipment" (CPE). A typical CE router
       serving a residential site has one CE WAN Side interface, one
       or more CE LAN Side interfaces, and a virtual 6rd interface. A
       6rd CE may also be referred to simply as a "CE" within the
       context of 6rd. 
</dd>
<dt>6rd delegated prefix</dt>
<dd>The IPv6 prefix calculated
       by the CE for use by hosts within the customer site by
       combining the 6rd prefix and the CE IPv4 Address obtained via
       IPv4 configuration methods. This prefix can be considered
       logically equivalent to a DHCPv6 IPv6 delegated prefix <a class='info' href='#RFC3633'>[RFC3633]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Troan, O. and R. Droms, &ldquo;IPv6 Prefix Options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) version 6,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>. 
</dd>
<dt>6rd domain</dt>
<dd>A set of 6rd CEs and BRs connected to
       the same virtual 6rd link. A Service Provider may deploy 6rd
       with a single 6rd domain, or may utilize multiple 6rd
       domains. Each domain requires a separate 6rd prefix.
</dd>
<dt>CE LAN side</dt>
<dd> The functionality of a 6rd CE that
       serves the "Local Area Network (LAN)" or "Home-facing" side the
       CE. The CE LAN Side interface is fully IPv6 enabled.
</dd>
<dt>CE WAN side</dt>
<dd>
       The functionality of a 6rd CE that serves the "Wide Area
       Network (WAN)" or "Service Provider-facing" side of the CE. The
       CE WAN Side is IPv4-only.
</dd>
<dt>6rd Border Relay (BR)</dt>
<dd>A 6rd-enabled router
       managed by the service provider at the edge of a 6rd domain. The 6rd BR
       router has at least one of each of the following: an
       IPv4-enabled interface, a 6rd virtual interface acting as an
       endpoint for the 6rd IPv6 in IPv4 tunnel, and an IPv6 interface
       reachable outside of the 6rd domain. A 6rd BR may also be
       referred to simply as a "BR" within the context of 6rd.
</dd>
<dt>BR IPv4 address</dt>
<dd>The IPv4 address of the 6rd
       Border Relay for a given 6rd domain. This IPv4 address is used
       by the CE to send packets to a BR in order to reach IPv6
       destinations outside of the 6rd domain. Typically, the BR IPv4
       address will be an anycast address. 
</dd>
<dt>6rd virtual interface</dt>
<dd> Internal multi-point
       tunnel interface where 6rd encapsulation and decapsulation of
       IPv6 packets inside IPv4 occurs. A typical CE or BR
       implementation requires only one 6rd virtual interface. A BR
       operating in multiple 6rd domains may require more than one 6rd
       Virtual Interface, but no more than one per 6rd domain.
</dd>
<dt>CE IPv4 address</dt>
<dd>The IPv4 address given to the CE
       as part of normal IPv4 Internet access (i.e., configured via
       DHCP, PPP, or otherwise). This address may be global or private
       <a class='info' href='#RFC1918'>[RFC1918]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rekhter, Y., Moskowitz, R., Karrenberg, D., Groot, G., and E. Lear, &ldquo;Address Allocation for Private Internets,&rdquo; February&nbsp;1996.</span><span>)</span></a> within the 6rd domain. This
       address is used by a 6rd CE to create the 6rd delegated prefix
       as well as to send and receive IPv4 encapsulated IPv6
       packets.

6rd prefix delegation</h3>

<p>The 6rd delegated prefix for use at a customer site is created
   by combining the 6rd prefix and some or all of the CE IPv4
   Address. From these elements, the 6rd delegated prefix is
   automatically created by the CE for the customer site when IPv4
   service is obtained. This 6rd delegated prefix is used in the same
   manner as a prefix obtained via DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation <a class='info' href='#RFC3633'>[RFC3633]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Troan, O. and R. Droms, &ldquo;IPv6 Prefix Options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) version 6,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>In 6to4, a similar operation is performed by incorporating an
   entire IPv4 address at a fixed location within a well-known /16
   IPv6 prefix. In 6rd, the IPv6 prefix as well as the position and
   number of bits of the IPv4 address incorporated varies from one 6rd
   domain to the next. 6rd allows the SP to adjust the size of the 6rd
   prefix, bits used by the 6rd mechanism, and how many bits are left
   to be delegated to customer sites. To allow for stateless address
   auto-configuration on the CE LAN Side, a 6rd delegated prefix MUST
   be /64 or shorter.
</p>
<p>The 6rd delegated prefix is created by concatenating the 6rd
   prefix and a consecutive set of bits from the CE IPv4 address in
   order. The sum of the number of bits used by each determines the
   size of the prefix that is delegated to the CE.

<p>For example, if the 6rd prefix is /32 and 24 bits of the CE IPv4
   address is used (e.g all CE IPv4 addresses can be aggregated by a
   10.0.0.0/8), then the size of the 6rd delegated prefix for
   each CE is automatically calculated to be /56 (32 + 24 = 56).
</p>
<p>Embedding less than the full 32 bits of a CE IPv4 address is
   possible only when an aggregated block of IPv4 addresses is
   available for a given 6rd domain. This may not be practical with
   global IPv4 addresses, but is quite likely in a deployment where
   private addresses are being assigned to CEs. If private addresses
   overlap within a given 6rd deployment, the deployment may be
   divided into separate 6rd domains, likely along the same topology
   lines the NAT-based IPv4 deployment itself would require. In this
   case, each domain is addressed with a different 6rd prefix.
</p>
<p>Each 6rd domain may use a different encoding of the embedded
   IPv4 address, even within the same service provider. For example,
   if multiple IPv4 address blocks with different levels of
   aggregation are used at the same service provider, the number of
   IPv4 bits needed to encode the 6rd delegated prefix may vary
   between each block. In this case, a different 6rd prefix, and hence
   separate 6rd domain, may be used to disambiguate the different
   encodings. 
</p>
<p>Since 6rd delegated prefixes are selected algorithmically from
   an IPv4 address, changing the IPv4 address will cause a change in
   the IPv6 delegated prefix which would ripple through the site's
   network and could be disruptive. As such, the service provider should
   assign CE IPv4 addresses with relatively long lifetimes.
</p>
<p>6rd IPv6 address assignment and hence the IPv6 service itself is
   tied to the IPv4 address lease (whether set via DHCP, PPP, or
   otherwise), thus the 6rd service is also tied to this in terms of
   authorization, accounting, etc. For example, the 6rd delegated
   prefix has the same DHCP lease time as its associated IPv4
   address. The prefix lifetimes advertised in Router Advertisements
   or used by DHCP on the CE LAN Side MUST be equal to or shorter
   than the IPv4 address lease time.

Troubleshooting and Traceability</h3>

<p>A 6rd IPv6 address and associated IPv4 address for a given

   provider that operates the given 6rd domain.  This may be useful

Neighbor Unreachability Detection</h3>

<p>Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD) for tunnels is
     described in Section 3.8 of <a class='info' href='#RFC4213'>[RFC4213]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nordmark, E. and R. Gilligan, &ldquo;Basic Transition Mechanisms for IPv6 Hosts and Routers,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>.
     In 6rd, all CEs and BRs can be considered as connected to the
     same virtual link and therefore neighbors to each other. This
     section describes how to utilize neighbor unreachability
     detection without negatively impacting the scalability of a 6rd
     deployment.
</p>
<p>A typical 6rd deployment may consist of a very large number of
     CEs within the same domain. Reachability between CEs is based on
     IPv4 routing, and sending NUD or any periodic packets between 6rd
     CE devices beyond isolated troubleshooting of the 6rd mechanism
     is not recommended. 
</p>
<p>While reachability detection between a given 6rd CE and BR is
     not necessary for the proper operation of 6rd, in cases where a
     CE has alternate paths for BR reachability to choose from it
     could be useful. Sending NUD messages to a BR, in particular
     periodic messages from a very large number of CEs, could result
     in overloading of the BR control message processing path,
     negatively affecting scalability of the 6rd deployment. Instead,
     a CE that needs to determine BR reachability MUST utilize a
     method which allows reachability detection packets to follow a
     typical data forwarding path without special processing by the
     BR. One such method is described below.
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>The CE constructs a Payload of any size and content to be sent
     to the BR (e.g., a zero length null payload, a padded payload
     designed to test a certain MTU, a NUD message, etc.). The exact
     format of the message payload is not important as the BR will not
     be processing it directly.
</li>
<li>The desired Payload is encapsulated with the inner IPv6 and
     outer IPv4 headers as follows:

     
<ul class="text">
<li>The IPv6 Destination Address is set to an address from the
       CE's 6rd delegated prefix for which the CE itself will process
       (e.g., a CE "loopback" or other type of local interface
       address).
</li>
<li>The IPv6 Source Address is set to an address from the CE's
       6rd delegated prefix as well, including the same as used for
       the IPv6 Destination Address.
</li>
<li>The IPv4 header is then added as it normally would for any
       packet destined for the BR. That is, the IPv4 Destination
       Address is that of the BR, and Source Address is the CE IPv4
       Address.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The CE sends the constructed packet out the proper
     interface it is monitoring BR reachability on. On successful
     receipt at the BR, the BR MUST decapsulate and forward the packet
     normally. This is, the IPv4 header is decapsulated normally,
     revealing the IPv6 destination as the CE, which in turn results
     in the packet being forwarded to that CE via the 6rd mechanism
     (i.e., the IPv4 Destination is that of the CE that originated the
     packet, and the IPv4 Source is that of the BR).
</li>
<li>Arrival of the constructed IPv6 packet at the CE's IPv6
     address completes one round trip to and from the BR, without
     causing the BR to process the message outside of its normal data
     forwarding path. The CE then processes the IPv6 packet
     accordingly (updating keepalive timers, metrics, etc).
</li>
</ol>

<p>The payload may be empty, or could contain values that are
   meaningful to the CE. Sending a proper NUD message could be
   convenient for some implementations. Since the BR forwards the
   packet as any other data packet without any processing of the
   payload itself, the format of the payload is left as a choice to
   the implementer.

<a name="rfc.section.10"></a><h3>10.&nbsp;
Transition Considerations</h3>

<p>6rd is intended to deliver a production-level IPv6 service to
   customer sites. Once 6rd IPv6 access is available, the SP network
   can migrate to IPv6 at its own pace with little or no effect on the
   customer. When native IPv6 is fully available, the CE is
   provisioned with IPv6 on its WAN side. 6rd and native IPv6 can
   coexist for a time while the customer site adopts the new IPv6
   service, and then 6rd de-provisioned.
</p>
<p>6rd utilizes the same encapsulation and base mechanism as 6to4
   and could in fact be viewed as a superset of 6to4. 6to4 service can
   be made with 6rd by setting the 6rd prefix to 2002::/16. Unlike
   6to4, 6rd is for use only in an environment where a service
   provider cooperates closely to deliver the IPv6 service.  6to4
   routes with the 2002::/16 prefix may exist alongside 6rd in the 6rd
   CE router, and doing so may offer some efficiencies when
   communicating directly with 6to4 routers.

<a name="rfc.section.11"></a><h3>11.&nbsp;
IPv6 Address Space Usage</h3>

<p>As 6rd uses service provider address space, 6rd uses the normal
   address delegation a service provider gets from its RIR and no
   global allocation of a single 6rd IANA assigned address block like
   the 6to4 2002::/16 is needed.
</p>
<p>The service provider's prefix must be short enough to encode the
   unique bits of all IPv4 addresses within a given 6rd domain and
   still provide a production-quality IPv6 service to the residential
   site. Assuming a worst case scenario using the full 32 bits for the
   IPv4 address, assigning a /56 for customer sites would mean that
   each service provider using 6rd would require a /24 for 6rd in
   addition to other IPv6 addressing needs. Assuming that 6rd would be
   stunningly successful and taken up by almost all AS number holders
   (32K today) then the total address usage of 6rd would be equivalent
   to a /9. If the SP instead delegated /60s to sites the service
   provider would require a /28 and the total global address
   consumption by 6rd would be equivalent to a /13. Again, this
   assumes that 6rd is used by all AS number holders in the IPv4
   Internet today at the same time, none used any of 6rd's address
   compression techniques, and that none have moved to native IPv6 and
   reclaimed the 6rd space which was being used for other
   purposes.
</p>
<p>To alleviate concerns about address usage, 6rd allows for leaving out
   redundant IPv4 prefix bits in the encoding of the IPv4 address inside the
   6rd IPv6 address. This is most useful where the IPv4 address space is very
   well aggregated. For example to provide each customer with a /60, if a
   service provider has all its IPv4 customers under a /12 then only 20 bits
   needs to be used to encode the IPv4 address and the service provider would
   only need a /40 IPv6 allocation for 6rd. If private address space is used
   then a 10/8 would require a /36. If multiple 10/8 domains are used then up
   to 16 could be supported within a /32.
</p>
<p>The 6rd address block can be reclaimed when all users of it have
   transitioned to native IPv6 service. This may require
   renumbering of customer sites and use of additional address
   space during the transition period.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>A 6to4 relay router as specified in <a class='info' href='#RFC3056'>RFC
   3056<span> (</span><span class='info'>Carpenter, B. and K. Moore, &ldquo;Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3056] can be used as an open relay. It can be used to relay
   IPv6 traffic and as a traffic anonymizer. By restricting the 6rd
   domain to within a provider network a CE only needs to accept
   packets from a single or small set of known 6rd BR IPv4 Addresses. As
   such, many of the threats against 6to4 as described in <a class='info' href='#RFC3964'>RFC3964<span> (</span><span class='info'>Savola, P. and C. Patel, &ldquo;Security Considerations for 6to4,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3964] do not apply.
</p>
<p>When applying the receiving rules in <a class='info' href='#receiving_rules'>Section&nbsp;9.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Receiving Rules</span><span>)</span></a>, IPv6 packets are as well
   protected against spoofing as IPv4 packets are within an SP
   network.
</p>
<p>A malicious user that is aware of a 6rd domain and the BR IPv4
   address could use this information to construct a packet that would cause a
   Border Relay Router to reflect tunneled packets outside of the domain that
   it is serving. If the attacker constructs the packet accordingly, and can
   inject a packet with an IPv6 source address that looks as if it originates
   from within the 6rd domain of the second border relay, forwarding loops
   between 6rd domains may be created, allowing the malicious user to launch a
   packet amplification attack between 6rd domains.
</p>
<p>One possible mitigation for this is to simply not allow the BR IPv4
   address to be reachable from outside the SP's 6rd domain. In this case,
   carefully constructed IPv6 packets still may be reflected off a single BR,
   but the looping condition will not occur. Tunnelled packets with the BR
   IPv4 address as the source address may also be filtered to prohibit 6rd
   tunnels from exiting the 6rd domain.
</p>
<p>To avoid forwarding loops via other internal relays, the BR
   should employ outgoing and incoming IPv4 packets filters, filtering
   out all known relay addresses for internal 6rd BRs, ISATAP routers or 6to4
   relays, including the well known anycast address space for
   6to4.
</p>
<p>The BR MUST install a sink route for its 6rd delegated prefix
   created based on its BR IPv4 address, with the exception of the
   IPv6 Subnet-Router anycast address.
