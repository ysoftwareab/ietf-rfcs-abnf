                         DNS over DTLS (DNSoD)
                     draft-ietf-dprive-dnsodtls-03

Abstract

   DNS queries and responses are visible to network elements on the path
   between the DNS client and its server.  These queries and responses
   can contain privacy-sensitive information which is valuable to
   protect.  An active attacker can send bogus responses causing
   misdirection of the subsequent connection.

   To counter passive listening and active attacks, this document
   proposes the use of Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) for DNS,
   to protect against passive listeners and certain active attacks.  As
   DNS needs to remain fast, this proposal also discusses mechanisms to
   reduce DTLS round trips and reduce DTLS handshake size.  The proposed
   mechanism runs over port 853.

1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System is specified in [RFC1034] and [RFC1035].  DNS
   queries and responses are normally exchanged unencrypted and are thus
   vulnerable to eavesdropping.  Such eavesdropping can result in an
   undesired entity learning domains that a host wishes to access, thus
   resulting in privacy leakage.  DNS privacy problem is further
   discussed in [I-D.bortzmeyer-dnsop-dns-privacy].

   Active attackers have long been successful at injecting bogus
   responses, causing cache poisoning and causing misdirection of the
   subsequent connection (if attacking A or AAAA records).  A popular
   mitigation against that attack is to use ephemeral and random source
   ports for DNS queries [RFC5452].

   This document defines DNS over DTLS (DNSoD, pronounced "dee-enn-sod")
   which provides confidential DNS communication for stub resolvers,
   recursive resolvers, iterative resolvers and authoritative servers.

Internet-Draft            DNS over DTLS (DNSoD)            November 2015


   The motivations for proposing DNSoD are that

   o  TCP suffers from network head-of-line blocking, where the loss of
      a packet causes all other TCP segments to not be delivered to the
      application until the lost packet is re-transmitted.  DNSoD,
      because it uses UDP, does not suffer from network head-of-line
      blocking.

   o  DTLS session resumption consumes 1 round trip whereas TLS session
      resumption can start only after TCP handshake is complete.
      Although TCP Fast Open [RFC7413] can reduce that handshake, TCP
      Fast Open is not yet available in commercially-popular operating
      systems.

1.1.  Relationship to TCP Queries and to DNSSEC

   DNS queries can be sent over UDP or TCP.  The scope of this document,
   however, is only UDP.  DNS over TCP could be protected with TLS, as
   described in [I-D.ietf-dprive-dns-over-tls].

   DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC [RFC4033]) provides object integrity
   of DNS resource records, allowing end-users (or their resolver) to
   verify legitimacy of responses.  However, DNSSEC does not protect
   privacy of DNS requests or responses.  DNSoD works in conjunction
   with DNSSEC, but DNSoD does not replace the need or value of DNSSEC.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

3.  DTLS session initiation, Polling and Discovery

   Many modern operating systems already detect if a web proxy is
   interfering with Internet communications, using proprietary
   mechanisms that are out of scope of this document.  After that
   mechanism has run (and detected Internet connectivity is working),
   the DNSoD procedure described in this document should commence.  This
   timing avoids delays in joining the network (and displaying an icon
   indicating successful Internet connection), at the risk that those
   initial DNS queries will be sent without protection afforded by
   DNSoD.

   DNSoD MUST run over standard UDP port 853 as defined in Section 8.  A
   DNS server that supports DNSoD MUST listen for and accept DTLS
   packets on a designated port 853.

Internet-Draft            DNS over DTLS (DNSoD)            November 2015


   The host should determine if the DNS server supports DNSoD by sending
   a DTLS ClientHello message.  A DNS server that does not support DNSoD
   will not respond to ClientHello messages sent by the client.  The
   client MUST use timer values defined in Section 4.2.4.1 of [RFC6347]
   for retransmission of ClientHello message and if no response is
   received from the DNS server.  After 15 seconds, it MUST cease
   attempts to re-transmit its ClientHello.  If the DNS client receives
   a hard ICMP error [RFC1122], it MUST immediately cease attempts to
   re-transmit its ClientHello.  Thereafter, the client MAY repeat that
   procedure in the event the DNS server has been upgraded to support
   DNSoD, but such probing SHOULD NOT be done more frequently than every
   24 hours and MUST NOT be done more frequently than every 15 minutes.
   This mechanism requires no additional signaling between the client
   and server.

4.  Performance Considerations

   To reduce number of octets of the DTLS handshake, especially the size
   of the certificate in the ServerHello (which can be several
   kilobytes), DNS client and server can use raw public keys [RFC7250]
   or Cached Information Extension [I-D.ietf-tls-cached-info].  Cached
   Information Extension avoids transmitting the server's certificate
   and certificate chain if the client has cached that information from
   a previous TLS handshake.

   Multiple DNS queries can be sent over a single DTLS session and the
   DNSoD client need not wait for an outstanding reply before sending
   the next query.  The existing Query ID allows multiple requests and
   responses to be interleaved in whatever order they can be fulfilled
   by the DNS server.  This means DNSoD reduces the consumption of UDP
   port numbers, and because DTLS protects the communication between a
   DNS client and its server, the resolver SHOULD NOT use random
   ephemeral source ports (Section 9.2 of [RFC5452]) because such source
   port use would incur additional, unnecessary DTLS load on the DNSoD
   server.  When sending multiple queries over a single DTLS session,
   clients MUST take care to avoid Message ID collisions.  In other
   words, they MUST not re-use the DNS Message ID of an in-flight query.

   It is highly advantageous to avoid server-side DTLS state and reduce
   the number of new DTLS sessions on the server which can be done with
   [RFC5077].  This also eliminates a round-trip for subsequent DNSoD
   queries, because with [RFC5077] the DTLS session does not need to be
   re-established.

   Compared to normal DNS, DTLS adds at least 13 octets of header, plus
   cipher and authentication overhead to every query and every response.
   This reduces the size of the DNS payload that can be carried.  DNS
   client and server MUST support the EDNS0 option defined in [RFC6891]

   so that the DNS client can indicate to the DNS server the maximum DNS
   response size it can handle without IP fragmentation.  If the DNS
   sever's response exceeds the EDNS0 value, the DNS server sets the TC
   (truncated) bit.  On receiving a response with the TC bit set, the
   client establishes a DNS-over-TLS connection to the same server, and
   sends a new DNS request for the same resource record

   DNSoD puts an additional computational load on servers.  The largest
   gain for privacy is to protect the communication between the DNS
   client (the end user's machine) and its caching resolver.
   Implementing DNSoD on root servers is outside the scope of this
   document.

5.  Established sessions

   In DTLS, all data is protected using the same record encoding and
   mechanisms.  When the mechanism described in this document is in
   effect, DNS messages are encrypted using the standard DTLS record
   encoding.  When a user of DTLS wishes to send an DNS message, it
   delivers it to the DTLS implementation as an ordinary application
   data write (e.g., SSL_write()).  To reduce client and server
   workload, clients SHOULD re-use the DTLS session.  A single DTLS
   session can be used to send multiple DNS requests and receive
   multiple DNS responses.

   DNSoD client and server can use DTLS heartbeat [RFC6520] to verify
   that the peer still has DTLS state.  DTLS session is terminated by
   the receipt of an authenticated message that closes the connection
   (e.g., a DTLS fatal alert).

6.  Anycast

   DNS servers are often configured with anycast addresses.  While the
   network is stable, packets transmitted from a particular source to an
   anycast address will reach the same server that has the cryptographic
   context from the DNS over DTLS handshake.  But when the network
   configuration changes, a DNS over DTLS packet can be received by a
   server that does not have the necessary cryptographic context.  To
   encourage the client to initiate a new DTLS handshake, DNS servers
   SHOULD generate a DTLS Alert message in response to receiving a DTLS
   packet for which the server does not have any cryptographic context.
   Upon receipt of an un-authenicated DTLS alert, the DTLS client

Internet-Draft            DNS over DTLS (DNSoD)            November 2015


   validates the Alert is within the replay window, as usual
   (Section 4.1.2.6 of [RFC6347]).  It is difficult for the DTLS client
   to validate the DTLS alert was generated by the DTLS server in
   response to a request or was generated by an on- or off-path
   attacker.  Thus, upon receipt of an in-window DTLS Alert, the client
   SHOULD continue re-transmitting the DTLS packet (in the event the
   Alert was spoofed), and at the same time it SHOULD initiate DTLS
   session resumption.

7.  Downgrade attacks

   Using DNS privacy with an authenticated server is most preferred, DNS
   privacy with an unauthenticated server is next preferred, and plain
   DNS is least preferred.  This section gives a non-normative
   discussion on common behaviors and choices.

   An implementation MAY attempt to obtain DNS privacy by contacting DNS
   servers on the local network (provided by DHCP) and on the Internet,
   and make those attempts in parallel to reduce user impact.  If DNS
   privacy cannot be successfully negotiated for whatever reason, the
   client can do three things:

   1.  refuse to send DNS queries on this network, which means the
       client cannot make effective use of this network, as modern
       networks require DNS; or,

   2.  use opportunistic security, as described in [RFC7435]. or,

   3.  send plain DNS queries on this network, which means no DNS
       privacy is provided.

   Heuristics can improve this situation, but only to a degree (e.g.,
   previous success of DNS privacy on this network may be reason to
   alert the user about failure to establish DNS privacy on this network
   now).  Still, the client (in cooperation with the end user) has to
   decide to use the network without the protection of DNS privacy.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add the following value to the "Service Name and
   Transport Protocol Port Number Registry" registry in the System
   Range.  The registry for that range requires IETF Review or IESG
   Approval [RFC6335] and such a review has been requested using the
   Early Allocation process [RFC7120] for the well-known UDP port in
   this document.

       Reference               This document

9.  Security Considerations

   The interaction between a DNS client and DNS server requires Datagram
   Transport Layer Security (DTLS) with a ciphersuite offering
   confidentiality protection and guidance given in [RFC7525] must be
   followed to avoid attacks on DTLS.  Once a DNSoD client has
   established a security association with a particular DNS server, and
   outstanding normal DNS queries with that server (if any) have been
   received, the DNSoD client MUST ignore any subsequent normal DNS
   responses from that server, as all subsequent responses should be
   encrypted.  This behavior mitigates all possible attacks described in
   Measures for Making DNS More Resilient against Forged Answers
   [RFC5452].

   The DNS Fragment extension does not impact security of DTLS session
   establishment or application data exchange.  DNS Fragment provides
   fragmentation and reassembly of the encrypted DNS payload.

   A malicious client might attempt to perform a high number of DTLS
   handshakes with a server.  As the clients are not uniquely identified
   by the protocol and can be obfuscated with IPv4 address sharing and
   with IPv6 temporary addresses, a server needs to mitigate the impact
   of such an attack.  Such mitigation might involve rate limiting
   handshakes from a certain subnet or more advanced DoS/DDoS techniques
   beyond the scope of this paper.

9.1.  Authenticating a DNS Privacy Server

   DNS privacy requires encrypting the query (and response) from passive
   attacks.  Such encryption typically provides integrity protection as
   a side-effect, which means on-path attackers cannot simply inject
   bogus DNS responses.  However, to provide stronger protection from
   active attackers pretending to be the server, the server itself needs
   to be authenticated.

   To authenticate the server providing DNS privacy, the DNS client
   needs to be configured with the names or IP addresses of those DNS
   privacy servers.  The server certificate MUST contain DNS-ID
   (subjectAltName) as described in Section 4.1 of [RFC6125].  DNS names



Reddy, et al.             Expires May 27, 2016                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft            DNS over DTLS (DNSoD)            November 2015


   and IP addresses can be contained in the subjectAltName entries.  The
   client MUST use the rules and guidelines given in section 6 of
   [RFC6125] to validate the DNS server identity.

   This could be implemented by adding the certificate name to the /etc/
   resolv.conf file, such as below:

     nameserver 8.8.8.8
     certificate google-public-dns.google.com
     nameserver 208.67.220.220
     certificate resolver.opendns.com

   For DNS privacy servers that don't have a certificate trust chain
   (e.g., because they are on a home network or a corporate network),
   the configured list of DNS privacy servers can contain the Subject
   Public Key Info (SPKI) fingerprint of the DNS privacy server (i.e., a
   simple whitelist of name and SPKI fingerprint).  The public key is
   used for the same reasons HTTP pinning [RFC7469] uses the public key.
   Raw public key-based authentication mechanism defined in [RFC7250]
   can be also used to authenticate the DNS server.

   This could be implemented by adding the SPKI fingerprint to the /etc/
   resolv.conf file, such as below (line split for Internet Draft
   formatting):

     nameserver 192.168.1.1
     sha256 : "d6qzRu9zOECb90Uez27xWltNsj0e1Md7GkYYkVoZWmM="

   The only algorithm considered at this time is "sha256", i.e., the
   hash algorithm SHA256 [RFC6234]; additional algorithms may be allowed
   for use in this context in the future.  The quoted-string is a
   sequence of base 64 digits: the base64-encoded SPKI Fingerprint
   [RFC4648].
