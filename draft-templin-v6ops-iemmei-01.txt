Abstract


   The Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) connects
   IPv6 hosts/routers over IPv4 networks via automatic tunneling using a
   link abstraction similar to the Non-Broadcast, Multiple Access (NBMA)
   model. This document describes operational extensions for ISATAP that
   enable a dynamic tunnel endpoint management abstraction similar to
   the ATM Permanent/Switched Virtual Circuit model. Nodes can use these
   extensions to realize mobility, multihoming and efficiency

1. Introduction


   The Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) connects
   IPv6 hosts/routers over IPv4 networks via automatic tunneling using a
   link abstraction similar to the Non-Broadcast, Multiple Access (NBMA)
   model [RFC2491]. This document presents ISATAP Extensions for
   Mobility, Multihoming, and Efficiency Improvement (IEMMEI -
   pronounced: "i-am-i") that enable a dynamic tunnel endpoint
   management abstraction similar to the ATM Permanent/Switched Virtual
   Circuit model [RFC2492]. Nodes that use these extensions can realize
   mobility, multihoming and efficiency improvements.


2. Terminology


   The terminology of [ISATAP][RFC2460][RFC2461] applies to this
   document. The following additional terms are defined:


   site:
      the same as defined in ([RFC3582], section 2). In practical terms,
      a site consists of one or more routers and their associated hosts.


   ISATAP link:
      the extent of an ISATAP interface's attached site; neighbor-
      dependent, and may be asymmetric based on egress and ingress
      directions.


   embedded gateway:
      the same as defined in ([STD3], section 1.1.4).


   logical interface:
      the same as defined in ([STD3], section 3.3.4.1). Within the
      context of this document, a logical interface is an IPv6 address
      or a configured tunnel associated with an ISATAP interface.


   IEMMEI node:
      A node that observes the specifications in [ISATAP] and adds
      operational extensions as described in this document.


   IEMMEI daemon:
      an IEMMEI node's server application that uses an API for control
      plane signaling based on IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages, and
      provides an abstraction similar to IPv6 Tunnel Broker [RFC3053]
      for configuring/managing tunnel endpoints.

Internet-Draft                   IEMMEI                       April 2004



   IEMMEI driver:
      an IEMMEI node's network module that provides an API for control
      plane signaling and tunnel endpoint configuration/management. Also
      provides a packet encapsulation/decapsulation engine, and an
      embedded gateway function.


3. IEMMEI Conceptual Model


   ISATAP interfaces are IPv6 interfaces that provide a non-broadcast
   multi-access abstraction for automatic tunneling of IPv6 packets over
   IPv4 networks. They also provide a forwarding plane nexus (used by
   the IEMMEI driver) for forwarding packets on behalf of their
   associated logical interfaces, and a control plane nexus (used by the
   IEMMEI daemon) for sending and receiving IPv6 neighbor discovery
   messages.


   The IEMMEI driver encapsulates packets for transmission according to
   a logical interface's attributes. It also determines the correct
   logical interface to receive each tunneled packet after
   decapsulation, and provides an embedded gateway function.


   The IEMMEI daemon configures/manages tunnel endpoints using IPv6
   neighbor discovery messages for control plane signaling. Each such
   tunnel endpoint is managed as an ISATAP interface's associated
   logical interface and provides a nexus for multiple applications
   using IPv6 addresses as application identifiers. Each such
   application identifier provides a nexus for multiple sessions. In
   summary, each tunnel endpoint can support multiple applications and
   multiple instances of each application.

4. IEMMEI Node Extensions


   IEMMEI nodes observe the specifications in [ISATAP] and add
   operational extensions as described in the following subsections of
   this document.  Proper application of these extensions can expand the
   [ISATAP] domain of applicability to include all operational scenarios
   covered under the IETF v6ops working group analysis.

Internet-Draft                   IEMMEI                       April 2004



4.1 Interface Management


   IEMMEI nodes typically create ISATAP interfaces statically during
   system startup but can also create them dynamically during runtime,
   e.g., when an IPv4 interface is enabled/disabled. Each ISATAP
   interface configures a locator set that includes IPv4 address-to-
   interface mappings from a single site.


   IEMMEI nodes typically configure tunnel endpoints dynamically during
   runtime as an ISATAP interface's associated logical interface, e.g.,
   via IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages processed by the IEMMEI daemon.
   Each tunnel endpoint inherits the locator set of its associated
   ISATAP interface.


4.2 Mobility Management


   IEMMEI nodes use the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery mechanisms specified in
   ([ISATAP], section 8) to manage the IPv6 L3 address to IPv4 L2
   addresses mappings for tunnel endpoints.


   When an IEMMEI node changes its IPv4 network point of attachment, it
   can send authenticated IPv6 neighbor discovery messages (e.g.,
   unsolicited Neighbor Advertisement messages) that include Link Layer
   Address Options (LLAOs) encoding the new IPv4 address ([RFC2529],
   section 5).


   When an IEMMEI node receives authentic IPv6 neighbor discovery
   messages that include such LLAOs, it can update appropriate L3->L2
   address mappings in tunnel endpoints.


   Using these extensions, the set of tunnel endpoints associated with
   an IEMMEI node's ISATAP interface(s) provides a binding cache for
   mobility management, and IPv6 neighbor discovery messages that
   include LLAOs provide a mechanism to dynamically manage L3->L2
   address mappings.

Internet-Draft                   IEMMEI                       April 2004



4.3 Encapsulation


   The IEMMEI driver encapsulates IPv6 packets according to the
   encapsulation attributes of an ISATAP interface's associated logical
   interface (or, according to the encapsulation attributes of other
   tunnel interfaces).  Encapsulation methods can include ip-protocol-41
   (e.g., 6over4 [RFC2529], 6to4 [RFC3056], configured tunnels [MECH],
   isatap itself [ISATAP], etc.), UDP/IPv4 encapsulation (e.g., teredo
   [TEREDO], etc.) and others (e.g., UDP-Lite [UDPLITE], minimal
   encapsulation within IP [RFC2004], etc.).


   Security processing, upper layer fragmentation and header compression
   for the packet's inner headers are performed prior to encapsulation.


4.4 Flow Labels


   IPv6 packets that comprise a flow can carry non-zero values in the
   Flow Label field to aid Packet Classifiers [RFC3697], but the IPv6
   Neighbor Discovery specification [RFC2461] makes no mention of the
   use of the Flow Label field in IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages.


   To aid packet classifiers, IEMMEI nodes can set the Flow Label field
   in Neighbor Solicitation, Router Solicitation and Redirect messages
   to the same value that appears in the Flow Label field of messages
   that triggered the solicitation/redirect event. They can also set the
   Flow Label field in Neighbor Advertisement and Router Advertisement
   messages to the same value that appears in the Flow Label field of
   messages that triggered the advertisement.


4.5 ISATAP Link and NAT Interactions


   IEMMEI nodes should use simple ip-protocol-41 encapsulation whenever
   possible, since it provides sufficient functionality for tunneling
   packets between IPv6 neighbors attached to the same ISATAP link. From
   an IEMMEI node's perspective, the extent of an ISATAP link is
   neighbor-dependent and may be asymmetric based on egress and ingress
   directions.

Internet-Draft                   IEMMEI                       April 2004



4.5.1 Egress Edge of the ISATAP Link


   For an ip-protocol-41 packet sent on an ISATAP interface, the
   theoretical egress edge of the ISATAP link occurs at the first
   Network Address Translator (NAT) along the forward path that would
   rewrite the packet's IPv4 destination address (or, at the IPv6
   neighbor that would decapsulate the packet if there is no such NAT).
   The ISATAP link cannot extend beyond this theoretical edge, since
   this would entail crossing an administrative boundary into a
   different addressing realm, i.e., into a different site. Therefore,
   the NAT at the theoretical egress edge of the ISATAP link should be
   configured as a site border ISATAP router.


   In practice, any intermediate NATs along the forward path to the
   decapsulator that rewrite the packet's IPv4 source address (but not
   the destination address) would require a simple modification to
   support extension of the ISATAP link to its theoretical egress edge.
   In particular, each such intermediate NAT should also rewrite the
   embedded IPv4 address (if any) in the packet's IPv6 source address.
   When the source address is rewritten, the mapping should be cached
   for future reference based on the packet's Flow Label field (see:
   section 4.4).


4.5.2 Ingress Edge of the ISATAP Link


   For an ip-protocol-41 packet received on an ISATAP interface, the
   theoretical ingress edge of the ISATAP link occurs at the last NAT
   along the reverse path that rewrote the packet's IPv4 destination
   address (or, at the IPv6 neighbor that encapsulated the packet if
   there is no such NAT). This point may be topologically "closer" to
   the IEMMEI node than the theoretical egress edge.


   In practice, any NATs along the reverse path to the encapsulator that
   re-write the packet's IPv4 destination address would require a simple
   modification to support extension of the ISATAP link to this
   theoretical ingress edge. In particular, each such NAT should also
   rewrite the embedded IPv4 address (if any) in the packet's IPv6
   destination address. When the destination address is rewritten, the
   mapping should be determined by consulting previously cached values
   based on the packet's Flow Label field (see: sections 4.4 and 4.5.1).


4.5.3 Legacy NAT Traversal


   When legacy NAT boxes that do not support these simple modifications
   are in the forward or reverse paths, IEMMEI nodes should use
   encapsulations that provide explicit NAT traversal (e.g., [TEREDO]).

Internet-Draft                   IEMMEI                       April 2004



4.6 Tunnel MTU and Fragmentation


   Due to well-known issues with path MTU discovery [RFC2923],
   applications may see greater performance by either only sending
   packets that are no larger than 1280bytes or by operationally
   disabling path MTU discovery such that the IP layer will fragment
   large packets to the minimum IPv6 MTU of 1280bytes ([RFC3542],
   section 11). Even so, packets/fragments encapsulated by the IEMMEI
   driver that are no larger than 1280 bytes may still require host-
   based IPv4 fragmentation, e.g., when an underlying link has a small
   IPv4 MTU [BCP48]. While this host-based fragmentation is not
   considered harmful, unmitigated IPv4 fragmentation caused by the
   network can cause poor performance [FRAG]. For example, since the
   minimum IPv4 fragment size is only 8 bytes, network middleboxes could
   shred a single 1280 byte encapsulated packet into as many as 160 IPv4
   fragments with obvious negative performance implications.


   When an IEMMEI node experiences poor performance related to excessive
   network-based IPv4 fragmentation along a path, it can reduce the size
   of the tunneled packets it sends until a size that yields improved
   performance is found. A lower bound of 68 bytes is used in this
   packet size determination, since every Internet module is expected to
   forward 68 byte datagrams without further IPv4 fragmentation.


   Appendix B provides informative text on the derivation of the 1280
   byte IPv6 minimum MTU.


   Appendix C provides informative text on an optional IPv4 reassembly
   cache management procedure that decapsulators can use to improve
   efficiency.


4.7 Decapsulation/Filtering


   IEMMEI nodes typically arrange for the IEMMEI driver to receive all
   encapsulated packets (see: section 4.1.2) for which the node
   configures a matching tunnel endpoint. For each encapsulated packet
   received, the IEMMEI driver uses the decapsulation and filtering
   specifications associated with the given encapsulation type.

5. IEMMEI Node Deployment Considerations


   IEMMEI nodes should support "ad-hoc" deployment in arbitrary
   networked environments. In other words, IEMMEI nodes should be able
   to discover enough information about their environment at boot time
   to automatically configure themselves for operation. Such information
   includes the addresses of site border gateways, the addresses of DNS
   recursive name servers, etc. An IEMMEI node should also be prepared
   to act as a site border router/bridge (or, "RBridge"
   [RBRIDGE][NDPROXY]), as a mobile RBridge, or as a simple host
   depending on its situational orientation.


   IEMMEI nodes that connect to the global Internet (e.g., via an ISP, a
   3GPP network, etc.) should automatically configure themselves as site
   border RBridge/servers, i.e., they should configure themselves as
   IPv6 RBridges, and configure DHCPv6 services
   [RFC3315][RFC3633][RFC3736] to support their associated hosts.
   Similarly, IEMMEI nodes with associated hosts that do not connect
   directly to the global Internet should obtain configuration
   information from an upstream RBridge/server (including prefix
   delegations) and configure themselves as edge RBridge/servers for
   logical IP subnets (LISs) within the parent site, i.e., they should
   configure themselves as an IPv6 RBridge and configure DHCPv6 services
   to support nodes on their downstream links. In this way, IEMMEI nodes
   can automatically configure themselves as site border RBridge/servers
   for recursively-nested "sites within sites".


   When an IEMMEI node configures itself as a site border
   RBridge/server, but does not receive a prefix delegation from an
   upstream provider, it should configure a unique local prefix space
   [UNIQUE] for downstream delegation. Unique local prefixes should also
   be used for intra-site and/or intra-organizational communications.


   IEMMEI nodes that might encounter neighbors on a downstream link,
   including those not configured as site RBridge/servers, should
   provide a basic L2 packet forwarding service (i.e., an L2 bridging
   service) if possible within constraints such as memory, battery
   power, RF link quality, etc. In order to adapt to the dynamically-
   changing network neighborhood and provide the appropriate L2 packet
   forwarding service, capable IEMMEI nodes should enable packet
   forwarding and use an efficient dynamic route discovery protocol such
   as those developed in the IETF MANET working group
   [RFC3561][RFC3626][RFC3684][DSR]. Unification of aspects of these new
   protocols with an efficient flooding mechanism and existing
   routing/bridging protocols (including OSPF [RFC2740] and IEEE 802.1D
   spanning tree [STP]) is currently under investigation.

6. Native IPv6 vs IPv6-in-IPv4 Encapsulation


   IEMMEI nodes that connect to the same physical L2 media segment can
   use native IPv6 directly over the L2 media. Attachment to the same
   physical L2 media segment is detected based on whether/not a neighbor
   responds to native IPv6 neighbor discovery messages sent over the L2
   media.


   To normalize issues associated with bridging dissimilar media (e.g.,
   path MTU black holes), and to support IPv6 neighbor discovery
   security mechanisms, IEMMEI nodes should use IPv4 as the common
   logical L2 encapsulation layer for sending IPv6 packets to neighbors
   that do not attach to the same physical L2 media segment.


7. Security considerations


   When the operational extensions described in this document are used,
   the Security Considerations in their respective references apply.


   Securing mechanisms for IPv6 neighbor discovery messages (e.g.,
   [CGA], [SEND], etc.) are used according to the trust model
   appropriate for the given deployment scenario [SENDPS].

Appendix B. The IPv6 minimum MTU


   The 1280 byte IPv6 minimum MTU was agreed through working group
   consensus in November 1997 discussions on the IPv6 mailing list. The
   size was chosen to allow extra room for link layer encapsulations
   without exceeding the Ethernet MTU of 1500 bytes, i.e., the practical
   physical cell size of the Internet. The 1280 byte MTU also provides a
   fixed upper bound for the size of IPv6 packets/fragments with a
   maximum store-and-forward delay budget of ~1 second assuming worst-
   case link speeds of ~10Kbps [BCP48], thus providing a convenient
   value for use in reassembly buffer timer settings. Finally, the 1280
   byte MTU allows transport connections (e.g., TCP) to configure a
   large-enough maximum segment size for improved performance even if
   the IPv4 interface that will send the tunneled packets uses a smaller
   MTU.

Appendix C. Optional IPv4 Reassembly Cache Management Procedure


   Decapsulating IEMMEI nodes can provide greater efficiency for tunnels
   that incur excessive network-based IPv4 fragmentation by implementing
   a simple IPv4 reassembly cache management procedure. When the initial
   fragment of an encapsulated packet arrives, the packet's IPv4
   reassembly timer is set to 1 second (i.e., the worst case store-and-
   forward delay budget for a 1280 byte packet). If an encapsulated
   packet's IPv4 reassembly timer expires:


   -  If enough contiguous leading bytes of the packet have arrived
      (e.g., see: [UDPLITE]), reassemble the packet using zero-filled or
      heuristically-chosen replacement data bytes in place of any
      missing fragments. (Otherwise, garbage-collect the reassembly
      buffer and return from processing.)


   -  Mark the packet as "INCOMPLETE", and also mark it with an
      "ACTUAL_BYTES" length that encodes the actual number of data bytes
      in fragments that arrived.


   -  Deliver the packet to the IEMMEI driver, and do not send an ICMPv4
      "time exceeded" message.


      When the IEMMEI driver processes this "INCOMPLETE" packet, it can
      send a message (e.g., an IPv6 Router Advertisement with an MTU
      option) to inform the far end of the tunnel that network-based
      IPv4 fragmentation may be causing poor performance along the path.
      The "INCOMPLETE" packet can also be forwarded to the final
      destination since some applications might realize greater
      efficiency by accepting partial information and requesting
      selective retransmission of missing portions, e.g., when [UDPLITE]
      is used.
