Internet Draft                  syslogMIB                      July 2007


Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB),
   the Syslog MIB, for use with network management protocols
   in the Internet community. In particular, the Syslog MIB will be
   used to monitor and control syslog applications.

Internet Draft                  syslogMIB                      July 2007


1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

2. Background

   Operating systems, processes and applications, collectively termed
   "facilities" in the following, generate messages indicating their own
   status or the occurrence of events. These messages are handled by
   what has come to be known as the syslog application[RFCPROT].  A
   syslog application sends and/or receives syslog messages. The reader
   is referred to [RFCPROT] for a description of the various roles of a
   syslog application viz. "sender", "receiver" and "relay". The
   discussion in this document in general applies to a generic syslog
   application. For special cases the specific role of the syslog
   application will be mentioned.

   This document defines a set of managed objects (MOs) that can be used
   to monitor a group of syslog applications.

   The SYSLOG-MIB can be used in conjunction with other MIB modules - in
   particular the Host Resources MIB[RFC2790]. The generic process
   related matters e.g. control and monitoring for status, resource
   usage etc. can be serviced by the corresponding entries in the Host
   Resources MIB.

                 Fig.1 Syslog applications modeled by the SYSLOG-MIB

   The syslog applications modeled by the SYSLOG-MIB are shown in Fig.1.
   A syslog receiver receives syslog messages. A syslog sender sends
   syslog messages to other syslog applications. A syslog relay forwards
   some of the received syslog messages to other syslog applications. A
   syslog receiver receives a syslog message and processes it. The
   processing will depend on the internal configuration and may involve
   relaying the message to one or more syslog applications. Note that a
   syslog application may have multiple roles.  Multiple syslog
   applications may co-exist on the same host.


3. The MIB Design.

   The purpose of the SYSLOG-MIB is to allow the monitoring of a group
   of syslog applications. This requires managed objects representing
   the following elements.

   o  The configuration and status related details of each syslog
      application.
   o  The statistics on syslog messages received, processed
      locally, relayed by each syslog application.


   The MIB contains three subtrees.
   o  The syslogNotifications subtree defines the set of
      notifications that will be used to asynchronously report

      the change of status of a syslog application.
   o  The syslogObjects subtree contains three subtrees.
      - The syslogControlTable subtree deals with the
        configuration and control information for a syslog
        application.
      - The syslogOperationsTable subtree deals with operations
        and statistical information about syslog messages sent
        and/or received by a syslog application.
   o  The conformance subtree defines the compliance statements.

   The SYSLOG-MIB module uses textual conventions defined in INET-
   ADDRESS-MIB[RFC4001] and SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB[RFC3411].

5. Security Considerations


   Syslog plays a very important role in the computer and network
   security of an organization. SYSLOG-MIB defines several managed
   objects that may be used to monitor, configure and control syslog
   applications. As such improper manipulation of the objects
   represented by this MIB may lead to an attack on an important
   component of the computer and network security infrastructure. The
   objects in syslogControlTable, syslogPriorityTable and
   syslogRelayTable may be misconfigured to cause syslog messages to be
   diverted or lost.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

            o  syslogControlTable: The objects in this table
               describe the configuration of the syslog applications.
               It may be misconfigured to start up a very large
               number of syslog applications (processes) and deny the
               system of its resources.
            o  syslogControlBindAddr: This object may be
               misconfigured to bind syslog application to the wrong
               address. This will cause messages to be lost.
            o  syslogControlBindPort : This object may be
               misconfigured to bind syslog application to the wrong
               service (port). This will cause messages to be lost.
            o  syslogControlMaxMessageSize: This message may be
               misconfigured to set the wrong MaxMessageSize for the
               syslog application. It may cause syslog messages to be
               lost.
            o  syslogControlConfFileName: This object may be
               misconfigured to start the syslog application with the
               wrong (rogue) configuration.
            o  syslogControlStorageType: This object may be
               misconfigured to set the wrong storage type. That may
               cause confusion, operational errors and/or loss of
               information.
            o  syslogPriorityTable: The objects in this table
               link the priority value in a syslog message to the

Internet Draft                  syslogMIB                      July 2007


               entry in the syslogRelayTable corresponding to the
               syslog collector to which the syslog message should be
               relayed. The table may be misconfigured to redirect
               a syslog message to a potentially non-existent wrong
               destination and/or to redirect a large number of messages
               to a particular syslog collector.
            o  syslogRelayTable: The rows in this table represent
               the relays to which syslog messages will be relayed,
               depending on the priority value in the respective
               syslog messages. The table may be misconfigured to
               redirect a syslog message to a potentially non-existent
               wrong destination and/or redirect a large number of
               messages to a particular syslog collector.


   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

           o  syslogOperationsTable: Objects in this table carry
              sensitive information. The counters may reveal
              information about the deployment and effectiveness of
              the relevant security systems. The counters may be
              analyzed to tell whether the security systems are able
              to detect an event or not.

           o  syslogOperationsLastError: This object may contain
              sensitive information e.g. user-id, password etc.
              depending on the implementation of the syslog application.
              It may reveal details about the syslog implementation
              itself, e.g. version, OS etc.

           o  syslogPriorityTable: Objects in this table carry
              sensitive information. The objects reveal how the
              syslog messages are grouped, relayed and/or stored.

           o  syslogRelayTable: Objects in this table carry sensitive
              information. The objects reveal the destination of
              syslog messages.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP application giving access to
   an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access
   to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB modules in this document use the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

   Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
   ----------        -----------------------

   syslogMIB         { mib-2 YYYY }

   IANA Reg.: Please assign a value under the 'mib-2' subtree
              for the 'syslogMIB' MODULE-IDENTITY  and record
              the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.

   RFC Ed.: When the above assignments have been made, please
              - remove the above note
              - replace "YYYY" here with the assigned values and
              - remove this note.

   yables are added.
Changes from draft-ietf-syslog-device-mib-14.txt
          to draft-ietf-syslog-device-mib-15.txt

   and not a service name
   Renamed syslogControlService to syslogControlBindPort
2. Eliminated "entity" wording and used "syslog application".
