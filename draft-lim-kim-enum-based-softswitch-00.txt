Abstract 
    
   This document describes simple requirement for softswitch, which use 
   ENUM DNS to route a call on VoIP service. This requirement is one of 
   interim solution to maintain stability of on-going commercial 
   softswitch system while initial stage of ENUM service that does not 
   have sufficient data.

1. Introduction
    
   ENUM[1] is a mapping system based on DNS[3] that converts from 
   E.164[2] number to domain name using 'Naming Authority 
   Pointer(NAPTR)' resource record, which is able to store different 
   service types such as fax, email, homepage, and etc., for every E.164 
   number. It originally focused on how end-user could access to other 
   end-user's information through the Internet.  
    
      Recently, various discussions are needed about RFC3761[1], because 
   infrastructure ENUM that provides routing information between 
   carriers. 
    
      Specially, In case of VoIP service, VoIP carrier that wants to 
   integrate various protocols uses softswitch. However, It is 
   inefficient for interconnection and number portability between 
   carriers because softswitch does not have all numbers that carriers 
   dealing with and it has its own number translation method for E.164 
   that is not compatible to others. Therefore, carriers expect many 
   benefits If they use a ENUM for routing purpose on softswitch. 
    
      However, it is too difficult to establish complete ENUM system all 
   over the world simultaneously. Interim period, which fills up the 
   data to ENUM DNS and make sure regulation of each country with 
   NRA(National Regulatory Authority) is necessary.   
    
      During the interim period, a group of carriers, which willing to 
   gather their own call-routing data to one ENUM DNS are also needed to 
   route a call that can not find a answer on ENUM DNS.  
    
      So, this document introduces simple requirement about call-routing 
   on ENUM-based softswitch that operated by VoIP carriers.  
 
2. Terminology
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [6]. 
    
3. Call-Routing of Softswitch

                  ENUM-based Softswitch Requirement      October 2006 
 
 
   In the PSTN(Public Switched Telephone Network), Only hardware-typed 
   switch rules the network. Softswitch is the switch implemented on 
   computer system by software. It usually controls various signaling 
   protocols which are SIP[7], H.323[8], MGCP[9], and etc., to make call 
   connections for VoIP service on the boundary point between circuit 
   and packet network.  
    
      To make call routing, first of all, Softswitch translate the 
   number as vendor specific method to routing information, which can 
   find destination. Today, prefix-based number translation has not only 
   used in legacy PSTN switch, but also used in softswitch very widely. 
       
      This kind of vendor specific call routing is only reference to 
   their own routing information, so if there is a carrier wants to get 
   out or get in, rest of carriers make some change routing information 
   on their softswitch. It is not efficient on the aspect of number 
   management. 
      
   Today, many carriers dealing with VoIP for several years, faces same 
   difficulties of inefficiency. For example, carriers process various 
   signaling protocols, and interconnect to multiple carriers without 
   any centralized point. Therefore, if softswitches are able to 
   transform E.164 number to routing information by using ENUM DNS, it 
   will be more efficient on call routing. 
    
4. Requirement for ENUM-based Softswitch
    
   To use ENUM DNS, softswitch need to have ENUM module that converts 
   from E.164 number to ENUM domain name defined in RFC3761 and process 
   a query to ENUM DNS. ENUM module MUST follow the RFC3761. 
    
   However, initial stage of ENUM DNS shares call routing information 
   from limited carriers, so It makes problem that softswitch can't find 
   all of call routing information on ENUM DNS. To solve this problem, 
   ENUM-based softswitch MUST follow the below.    
    
       1. ENUM module of softswitch converts E.164 number comes from the 
          VoIP subscriber to domain name defined RFC3761. 
          
       2. ENUM module of softswitch as a stub resolver, send a query to 
          recursive name server with domain name described above. 
    
       3. If the 'Rcode' field is '3', which means 'non-existence 
          domain' in answer section of DNS message defined RCF1035[4], 
          softswitch MUST translate the number with its vendor specific 
          prefix-based translation subsequently.  
    
      Even if the interim period, carriers can use ENUM DNS for number 
   translation without any affect on their on-going commercial service.

   At the first time, most of calls queried to ENUM DNS is almost hard 
   to get the answer in case of small group of carriers, however it will 
   be getting more answer from ENUM DNS if group of carriers is getting 
   more bigger. 
    
   It seems like inefficient because administrator maintains two 
   management points of numbers which is ENUM DNS and softswitch itself. 
   However it will be able to minimize failure ratio of call routing 
   from transition period of ENUM, and hereafter if ENUM comes to fill, 
   there is single management point on ENUM without any major changes on 
   softswitch. 
    
5. e164.arpa' consideration 
    
   Today, some discussions about Infrastructure ENUM consideration based 
   on RFC3761, is related to new 'e164.arpa' tree. ENUM module embeded 
   on softswitch MUST follow the new e164.arpa tree when new branch 
   method of e164.arpa for Infrastructue ENUM is set. 
    
6. Security Considerations 
    
   If the recursive DNS handles ENUM queries from softswitch is 
   compromised by attacker, It will be able to make wrong call routing 
   or occur delay to call.  Therefore, recursive DNS MAY lets in the 
   local network as same as softswitch, and restrict access from outside 
   with proper access-list policy.
