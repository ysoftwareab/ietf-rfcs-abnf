1.  Introduction

   The Mobile Node Identifier Option for MIPv6 [RFC4283] has proved to
   be a popular design tool for providing identifiers for mobile nodes
   during authentication procedures with AAA protocols such as Diameter
   [RFC3588].  To date, only a single type of identifier has been
   specified, namely the MN NAI.  Other types of identifiers are in
   common use, and even referenced in RFC 4283.  In this document, we
   propose adding some basic types that are defined in various
   telecommunications standards, including types for IMSI
   [ThreeGPP-IDS], P-TMSI [ThreeGPP-IDS], IMEI [ThreeGPP-IDS], and GUTI
   [ThreeGPP-IDS].  In addition, we specify the IPv6 address itself and
   IEEE MAC-layer addresses as mobile node identifiers.  Defining
   identifiers that are tied to the physical elements of the device (

   MAC address etc.) help in deployment of Mobile IP because in many
   cases such identifiers are the most natural means for uniquely
   identifying the device, and will avoid additional look-up steps that
   might be needed if other identifiers were used.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

3.  New Mobile Node Identifier Types

   The following types of identifiers are commonly used to identify
   mobile nodes.  For each type, references are provided with full
   details on the format of the type of identifer.

                    Mobile Node Identifier Description

   +--------------+-----------------------------------+----------------+
   | Identifier   | Description                       | Reference      |
   | Type         |                                   |                |
   +--------------+-----------------------------------+----------------+
   | IPv6 Address |                                   | [RFC4291]      |
   | IMSI         | International Mobile Subscriber   | [ThreeGPP-IDS] |
   |              | Identity                          |                |
   | P-TMSI       | Packet-Temporary Mobile           | [ThreeGPP-IDS] |
   |              | Subscriber Identity               |                |
   | GUTI         | Globally Unique Temporary ID      | [ThreeGPP-IDS] |
   | EUI-48       | 48-bit Extended Unique Identifier | [IEEE802]      |
   | address      |                                   |                |
   | EUI-64       | 64-bit Extended Unique            | [IEEE802]      |
   | address      | Identifier-64 bit                 |                |
   | DUID         | DHCPv6 Unique Identifier          | [RFC3315]      |

4.  Descriptions of MNID types

   In this section descriptions for the various MNID types are provided.

4.1.  Description of the IPv6 address type

   The IPv6 address [RFC4291] is encoded as a 16 octet string containing
   a full IPv6 address which has been assigned to the mobile node.  The
   IPv6 address MUST be a unicast routable IPv6 address.  Multicast

Internet-Draft      MN Identifier Types for RFC 4283          March 2018


   addresses, link-local addresses, and the unspecified IPv6 address
   MUST NOT be used.  IPv6 Unique Local Addresses (ULAs) MAY be used, as
   long as any security operations making use of the ULA also take into
   account the domain in which the ULA is guaranteed to be unique.

4.2.  Description of the IMSI MNID type

   The International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) [ThreeGPP-IDS] is
   at most 15 decimal digits (i.e., digits from 0 through 9).  The IMSI
   MUST be encoded as a string of octets in network order (i.e., high-
   to-low for all digits), where each digit occupies 4 bits.  If needed
   for full octet size, the last digit MUST be padded with 0xf.  For
   example an example IMSI 123456123456789 would be encoded as follows:

      0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78, 0x9f

4.3.  Description of the EUI-48 address type

   The IEEE EUI-48 address [IEEE802-eui48] is encoded as 6 octets
   containing the IEEE EUI-48 address.

4.4.  Description of the EUI-64 address type

   The IEEE EUI-64 address [IEEE802-eui64] is encoded as 8 octets
   containing the full IEEE EUI-64 address.

4.5.  Description of the DUID type

   The DUID is the DHCPv6 Unique Identifier (DUID) [RFC3315].  There are
   various types of DUID, which are distinguished by an initial two-
   octet type field.  Clients and servers MUST treat DUIDs as opaque
   values and MUST only compare DUIDs for equality.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any security mechanisms, and does
   not have any impact on existing security mechanisms.

   Mobile Node Identifiers such as those described in this document are
   considered to be private information.  If used in the MNID extension
   as defined in [RFC4283], the packet including the MNID extension MUST
   be encrypted so that no personal information or trackable identifiers
   is inadvertently disclosed to passive observers.  Operators can
   potentially apply IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)
   [RFC4303], in transport mode, with confidentiality and integrity
   protection for protecting the identity and location information in
   Mobile IPv6 signaling messages.

Internet-Draft      MN Identifier Types for RFC 4283          March 2018


   Some MNIDs contain sensitive identifiers which, as used in protocols
   specified by other SDOs, are only used for signaling during initial
   network entry.  In such protocols, subsequent exchanges then rely on
   a temporary identifier allocated during the initial network entry.
   Managing the association between long-lived and temporary identifiers
   is outside the scope of this document.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The new mobile node identifier types defined in the document should
   be assigned values from the "Mobile Node Identifier Option Subtypes"
   registry.  The following values should be assigned.

                     New Mobile Node Identifier Types

               +-----------------+------------------------+
               | Identifier Type | Identifier Type Number |
               +-----------------+------------------------+
               | IPv6 Address    | 2                      |
               | IMSI            | 3                      |
               | P-TMSI          | 4                      |
               | EUI-48 address  | 5                      |
               | EUI-64 address  | 6                      |
               | GUTI            | 7                      |
               | DUID-LLT        | 8                      |
               | DUID-EN         | 9                      |
               | DUID-LL         | 10                     |
               | DUID-UUID       | 11                     |
               |                 | 12-15 reserved         |
               |                 | 16-255 unassigned      |
               +-----------------+------------------------+

                                  Table 2

   See Section 4 for additional information about the identifier types.
   Future new assignments are to be made only after Expert Review
   [RFC8126].  The expert must ascertain that the identifier type allows
   unique identification of the mobile device; since all MNIDs require
   encryption there is no additional privacy exposure attendent to the
   use of new types.

Appendix A.  RFID types

   The material in this non-normative appendix was originally composed
   for inclusion in the main body of the specification, but was moved
   into an appendix because there was insufficient support for
   allocating RFID types at this time.  It was observed that RFID-based
   mobile devices may create privacy exposures unless confidentiality is
   assured for signaling.  A specification for eliminating unauthorized
   RFID tracking based on layer-2 addresses would be helpful.

   Much of the following text is due to contributions from Hakima
   Chaouchi.  For an overview and some initial suggestions about using
   RFID with IPv6 on mobile devices, see [Using-RFID-IPv6].

   In the context of IoT and industry 4.0 vertical domain, efficient
   inventory and tracking items is of major interest, and RFID
   technology is the identification technology in the hardware design of
   many such items.

   The "TRACKIOT: Heterogeneous IoT control" project ([TRACK-IoT],
   [RFID-framework]) explored Mobile IPv6 as a mobility management
   protocol for RFID-based mobile devices.

   1.  Passive RFID tags (that have no processing resources) need to be
       handled by the gateway (likely also the RFID Reader), which is
       then the end point of the mobility protocol.  It is also the
       point where the CoA will be created based on some combination
       such as the RFID tag and the prefix of that gateway.  The point
       here is to offer the possibility to passive RFID items to get an
       IPv6 address and take advantage of the mobility framework to
       follow the mobile device (passive tag on the item).  One example
       scenario that has been proposed, showing the need for mobility
       management of passive RFID items, would be pieces of art tagged
       with passive tags that need to be monitored while transported.
   2.  Using active RFID tags (where processing resource is available on
       the tag), the end point of the mobility protocol can be pushed up
       to the RFID Active tag.  We name it also an identification
       sensor.  Use cases include active RFID tags for traceability of
       cold food respect during mobility (transport) of food.  Mobility
       of cars equiped with active RFID tags that we already use for
       toll payement can be added with mobility management.

   One major effort of connecting IETF efforts to the EPCGlobal (RFID
   standardisation) led to the ONS (DNS version applied for RFID logical
   names and page information retrieval).  Attempts have tried to
   connect IPv6 on the address space to RFID identifier format.  Other
   initiatives started working on gateways to map tag identifiers with
   IPv6 addresses and build signaling protocols for the application
   level.  For instance tracking of mobile items equipped with a tag can
   be triggered remotely by a remote correspondent node until a visiting
   area where a mobile item equipped with an RFID tag is located.  An
   RFID reader will be added with an IPv6 to RFID tag translation.  One
   option is to build a Home IPv6 address of that tagged item by using
   the prefix of the Home agent combined with the tag RFID identifier of
   the mobile item; as the tag ID is unique, the home IPv6 address of
   that item will be also unique.  Then the visiting RFID reader will
   compose the IPV6 care of address of the tagged mobile item by
   combining the prefix of the RFID reader with the tag ID of the item).

   MIPv6 can then provide normally the mobility management of that RFID
   tagged item.  A different useful example of tagged items involves
   items of a factory that can be tracked while they are transported,
   especially for real time localisation and tracking of precious items
   transported without GPS.  An automotive car manufacturer can assign
   IPv6 addresses corresponding to RFID tagged cars or mechanical car
   parts, and build a tracking dataset of the mobility not only of the
   cars, but also of the mechanical pieces.

   The Tag Data standard promoted by Electronic Product Code(TM)
   (abbreviated EPC) [EPC-Tag-Data] supports several encoding systems or
   schemes, which are commonly used in RFID (radio-frequency
   identification) applications, including

   o  RFID-GID (Global Identifier),
   o  RFID-SGTIN (Serialized Global Trade Item Number),
   o  RFID-SSCC (Serial Shipping Container),
   o  RFID-SGLN (Global Location Number),
   o  RFID-GRAI (Global Returnable Asset Identifier),
   o  RFID-DOD (Department of Defense ID), and
   o  RFID-GIAI (Global Individual Asset Identifier).

   For each RFID scheme except GID, there are three representations:

   o  a 64-bit binary representation (for example, SGLN-64) (except for
      GID)
   o  a 96-bit binary representation (SGLN-96)
   o  a representation as a URI

   The URI representation for the RFID is actually a URN.  The EPC
   document has the following language:

      All categories of URIs are represented as Uniform Reference Names
      (URNs) as defined by [RFC2141], where the URN Namespace is epc.

   The following list includes the above RFID types.

Internet-Draft      MN Identifier Types for RFC 4283          March 2018


A.1.  Description of the RFID types

   The General Identifier (GID) that is used with RFID is composed of
   three fields - the General Manager Number, Object Class and Serial
   Number.  The General Manager Number identifies an organizational
   entity that is responsible for maintaining the numbers in subsequent
   fields.  GID encodings include a fourth field, the header, to
   guarantee uniqueness in the namespace defined by EPC.

   Some of the RFID types depend on the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN)
   code defined in the General EAN.UCC Specifications [EANUCCGS].  A
   GTIN identifies a particular class of object, such as a particular
   kind of product or SKU.

   The EPC encoding scheme for SGTIN permits the direct embedding of
   EAN.UCC System standard GTIN and Serial Number codes on EPC tags.  In
   all cases, the check digit is not encoded.  Two encoding schemes are
   specified, SGTIN-64 (64 bits) and SGTIN-96 (96 bits).

   The Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC) is defined by the EAN.UCC
   Specifications.  Unlike the GTIN, the SSCC is already intended for
   assignment to individual objects and therefore does not require
   additional fields to serve as an EPC pure identity.  Two encoding
   schemes are specified, SSCC-64 (64 bits) and SSCC-96 (96 bits).

   The Global Location Number (GLN) is defined by the EAN.UCC
   Specifications.  A GLN can represent either a discrete, unique
   physical location such as a warehouse slot, or an aggregate physical
   location such as an entire warehouse.  In addition, a GLN can
   represent a logical entity that performs a business function such as
   placing an order.  The Serialized Global Location Number (SGLN)
   includes the Company Prefix, Location Reference, and Serial Number.

   The Global Returnable Asset Identifier (GRAI) is defined by the
   General EAN.UCC Specifications.  Unlike the GTIN, the GRAI is already
   intended for assignment to individual objects and therefore does not
   require any additional fields to serve as an EPC pure identity.  The
   GRAI includes the Company Prefix, Asset Type, and Serial Number.

   The Global Individual Asset Identifier (GIAI) is defined by the
   General EAN.UCC Specifications.  Unlike the GTIN, the GIAI is already
   intended for assignment to individual objects and therefore does not
   require any additional fields to serve as an EPC pure identity.  The
   GRAI includes the Company Prefix, and Individual Asset Reference.

   The DoD Construct identifier is defined by the United States
   Department of Defense (DoD).  This tag data construct may be used to

   encode tags for shipping goods to the DoD by a supplier who has
   already been assigned a CAGE (Commercial and Government Entity) code.

A.1.1.  Description of the RFID-SGTIN-64 type

   The RFID-SGTIN-64 is encoded as specified in [EPC-Tag-Data].  The
   SGTIN-64 includes five fields: Header, Filter Value (additional data
   that is used for fast filtering and pre-selection), Company Prefix
   Index, Item Reference, and Serial Number.  Only a limited number of
   Company Prefixes can be represented in the 64-bit tag.

A.1.2.  Description of the RFID-SGTIN-96 type

   The RFID-SGTIN-96 is encoded as specified in [EPC-Tag-Data].  The
   SGTIN-96 includes six fields: Header, Filter Value, Partition (an
   indication of where the subsequent Company Prefix and Item Reference
   numbers are divided), Company Prefix Index, Item Reference, and
   Serial Number.

A.1.3.  Description of the RFID-SSCC-64 type

   The RFID-SSCC-64 is encoded as specified in [EPC-Tag-Data].  The
   SSCC-64 includes four fields: Header, Filter Value, Company Prefix
   Index, and Serial Reference.  Only a limited number of Company
   Prefixes can be represented in the 64-bit tag.

A.1.4.  Description of the RFID-SSCC-96 type

   The RFID-SSCC-96 is encoded as specified in [EPC-Tag-Data].  The
   SSCC-96 includes six fields: Header, Filter Value, Partition, Company
   Prefix, and Serial Reference, as well as 24 bits that remain
   Unallocated and must be zero.

A.1.5.  Description of the RFID-SGLN-64 type

   The RFID-SGLN-64 type is encoded as specified in [EPC-Tag-Data].  The
   SGLN-64 includes five fields: Header, Filter Value, Company Prefix
   Index, Location Reference, and Serial Number.

A.1.6.  Description of the RFID-SGLN-96 type

   The RFID-SGLN-96 type is encoded as specified in [EPC-Tag-Data].  The
   SGLN-96 includes six fields: Header, Filter Value, Partition, Company
   Prefix, Location Reference, and Serial Number.

A.1.7.  Description of the RFID-GRAI-64 type

   The RFID-GRAI-64 type is encoded as specified in [EPC-Tag-Data].  The
   GRAI-64 includes five fields: Header, Filter Value, Company Prefix
   Index, Asset Type, and Serial Number.

A.1.8.  Description of the RFID-GRAI-96 type

   The RFID-GRAI-96 type is encoded as specified in [EPC-Tag-Data].  The
   GRAI-96 includes six fields: Header, Filter Value, Partition, Company
   Prefix, Asset Type, and Serial Number.

A.1.9.  Description of the RFID-GIAI-64 type

   The RFID-GIAI-64 type is encoded as specified in [EPC-Tag-Data].  The
   GIAI-64 includes four fields: Header, Filter Value, Company Prefix
   Index, and Individual Asset Reference.

A.1.10.  Description of the RFID-GIAI-96 type

   The RFID-GIAI-96 type is encoded as specified in [EPC-Tag-Data].  The
   GIAI-96 includes five fields: Header, Filter Value, Partition,
   Company Prefix, and Individual Asset Reference.

A.1.11.  Description of the RFID-DoD-64 type

   The RFID-DoD-64 type is encoded as specified in [RFID-DoD-spec].  The
   DoD-64 type includes four fields: Header, Filter Value, Government
   Managed Identifier, and Serial Number.

A.1.12.  Description of the RFID-DoD-96 type

   The RFID-DoD-96 type is encoded as specified in [RFID-DoD-spec].  The
   DoD-96 type includes four fields: Header, Filter Value, Government
   Managed Identifier, and Serial Number.

A.1.13.  Description of the RFID URI types

   In some cases, it is desirable to encode in URI form a specific
   encoding of an RFID tag.  For example, an application may prefer a
   URI representation for report preparation.  Applications that wish to
   manipulate any additional data fields on tags may need some
   representation other than the pure identity forms.

   For this purpose, the fields as represented the previous sections are
   associated with specified fields in the various URI types.  For
   instance, the URI may have fields such as CompanyPrefix,
