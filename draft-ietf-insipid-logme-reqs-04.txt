           Requirements for Marking SIP Messages to be Logged
                    draft-ietf-insipid-logme-reqs-04

Abstract

   SIP networks use signalling monitoring tools to debug customer
   reported problems and for regression testing if network or client
   software is upgraded.  As networks grow and become interconnected,
   including connection via transit networks, it becomes impractical to
   predict the path that SIP signalling will take between clients, and
   therefore impractical to monitor SIP signalling end-to-end.

   This draft describes requirements for adding an indicator to the SIP
   protocol data unit (PDU, or a SIP message) that marks the PDU as a
   candidate for logging.  Such marking will typically be applied as
   part of network testing controlled by the network operator and not
   used in regular client signalling.  However, such marking can be
   carried end-to-end including the SIP terminals, even if a session
   originates and terminates in different networks.

1.  Introduction

   Service providers who use SIP (see RFC 3261 [RFC3261]) in their
   networks need the ability to debug customer reported problems and
   also need to run regression tests if SIP client software/hardware is
   upgraded.  Such debugging and tests might be confined to a single
   service provider but might also be needed for customers who have
   different service providers, including providers in different
   countries that are interconnected through networks belonging to one
   or more third parties.

   A mechanism is needed to mark particular SIP sessions, i.e. those
   related to debugging or regression testing, as candidates for logging
   and this marking must be carried within the candidate SIP messages as
   they are routed across networks (and geographies) to enable logging

   at each SIP entity without having to know in advance the list of SIP
   entities through which the SIP signaling messages will traverse.
   Such marking must take into account that SIP messages might traverse
   different service providers, different countries, regions with
   different privacy requirements, and different trust domains.  This
   draft describes the requirements for such a "log me" marker for SIP
   signalling.

2.  Conventions Used in this Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Motivating Scenario

   Signalling for SIP session setup can cross several networks, and
   these networks may not have common ownership and also may be in
   different countries.  If a single operator wishes to perform
   regression testing or fault debugging end-to-end, the separate
   ownership of networks that carry the signalling and the explosion in
   the number of possible signalling paths through SIP entities from the
   originating to the terminating user make it impractical to pre-
   configure logging of an end-to-end SIP signalling of a session of
   interest.

   The figure below gives an example of a signalling path through
   multiple networks.

4.  Basic Debugging Procedure

   The debugging procedure steps are outlined below.  The entire SIP
   message (SIP headers and message body) MUST be logged using the SIP
   CLF format defined in RFC 6873 [RFC6873], with Vendor-ID = 00000000
   and Tag = 02 in the <OptionalFields> portion of the SIP CLF record
   (see RFC 6873 [RFC6873] clause 4.4).  Header fields MUST be logged in
   their long form and not the compact form described in RFC 3261
   [RFC3261] clause 7.3.3.

   o  The user's terminal is placed in debug mode.  The terminal logs
      its own signalling and inserts a "log me" marker into SIP requests
      for session setup.

   o  All SIP entities that the signalling traverses, from the first
      proxy the terminal connects to at the edge of the network to the
      destination client terminal, can detect that the "log me" marker
      is present and can log SIP requests and responses that contain the
      marker if configured to do so.

   o  Subsequent responses and requests in the same dialog are logged.

   o  Logging stops, either because the dialog has ended or because a
      'stop event', typically expiry of a certain amount of time,
      occurred.  The definition of stop event types and the
      configuration of stop events in the SIP entity is outside the
      scope of this document.

   o  When and how signalling logs are retrieved is out of scope of this
      document.  Logs might be retrieved by logging on to the SIP entity
      that contains the logs, by sending logs to a central server that
      is co-ordinating debugging, by storing them on removable media for
      later manual collection, or by some other method.

5.  Requirements for a "Log Me" Marker

   o  REQ1: It MUST be possible to mark a SIP request or response as of
      interest for logging by inserting a "log me" marker.  This is
      known as "log me" marking.

   o  REQ2: It MUST be possible for a "log me" marker to cross network
      boundaries.

   o  REQ3: A "log me" marker is most effective if it passes end-to-end.
      However, source networks should behave responsibly and not leave
      it to a downstream network to detect and remove a marker that it
      will not use.  A "log me" marker SHOULD be removed at trust domain
      boundaries.

   o  REQ4: The presence of a "log me" marker indicates that a request
      or response is part of debugging or regression testing.  SIP
      entities that support "log me" marking SHOULD log SIP requests or
      responses that contain a "log me" marker."  The SIP entity checks
      for the presence of a "log me" marker and writes any request or
      response that contains a "log me" marker to a log file.

Internet-Draft                log me marker                  August 2015


   o  REQ5: If a UA that supports "log me" marking receives a request
      with a "log me" marker, it MUST echo that "log me" marker in
      responses to that request.

   o  REQ6: A SIP proxy MAY insert a "log me" marker into requests and
      responses.  The typical case for which a proxy needs to insert a
      "log me" marker is for compatibility with UAs that have not
      implemented "logme" marking, i.e. when a UA has not marked a
      request or when responses received on a dialog of interest for
      logging do not contain an echoed "log me" marker.  In these cases,
      the entity that inserts a "log me" marker is stateful inasmuch as
      it must remember when a dialog is of interest for logging.  An
      entity that inserts a "log me" marker SHOULD also log the SIP
      request or response as per REQ4.

   o  REQ7: SIP proxies MAY be stateless in terms of logging of SIP
      requests that contain a "log me" marker, i.e. they MAY base the
      decision to log a SIP request or response solely on the presence
      of the "log me" marker.  For example, it is OPTIONAL for a SIP
      entity to maintain state of which SIP requests contained a "log
      me" marker in order to log responses to those requests.  Echoing a
      "log me" marker in responses is the responsibility of the UA that
      receives a request.

   o  REQ8: A "log me" marker MAY include an identifier that indicates
      the test case that caused it to be inserted, known as a test case
      identifier.  The test case identifier does not have any impact on
      session setup, it is used by the debugging server to collate all
      logged SIP requests and responses to the initial SIP request in a
      dialog or standalone transaction.  The Session-ID described in RFC
      7206 [RFC7206] and I-D.ietf-insipid-session-id-12
      [I-D.ietf-insipid-session-id] could be used as the test case
      identifier but it would be useful for the UA to log a human
      readable name together with this Session-ID when it performs "log
      me" marking of an initial SIP request.

   o  REQ9: "log me" marking of requests and responses MUST be applied
      on a per-dialog granularity.  If applied, "log me" marking MUST
      begin with the dialog-creating request and SHOULD continue to the
      dialog end. "log me" marking MUST NOT be stopped and re-started on
      a given dialog.

6.  Security Considerations

   In order to prevent any security implications of a "log me" marker,
   the marker itself MUST not contain any sensitive information,
   detecting its presence or absence MUST NOT reveal sensitive
   information, and maliciously adding a "log me" marker MUST NOT

   adversely affect a network.  This section analyses how to meet these
   requirements.

6.1.  Trust Domain

   Since a "log me" marker may cause a SIP entity to log the SIP header
   and body of a request or response, the "log me" marker SHOULD be
   removed at a trust domain boundary.  If a prior agreement to log
   sessions exists with the next hop network then the "log me" marker
   might not be removed.

6.2.  Security Threats

6.2.1.  "Log Me" Marking

   The "log me" marker MUST not convey any sensitive information,
   although the "log me" marker will sometimes be inserted because a
   particular device is experiencing problems.

   The presence of a "log me" marker will cause some SIP entities to log
   signalling.  Therefore, this marker must be removed at the earliest
   opportunity if it has been incorrectly inserted.

   Activating a debug mode affects the operation of a terminal,
   therefore debugging configuration must be supplied by an authorized
   server to an authorized terminal, debugging configuration must not be
   altered in transit, and must not be readable by an unauthorized third
   party.

   Logged signalling is privacy-sensitive data, therefore signalling
   logs must be passed to an authorized server, must not be altered in
   transit, and must not be readable by an unauthorized third party.

6.2.2.  Sending Logged Information

   A SIP entity that has logged information should encrypt it, such that
   it can be decrypted only by the debug server, before sending it to a
   debug server in order to protect the content of logs from a third
   party.
