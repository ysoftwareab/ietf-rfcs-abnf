Abstract

   The Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme "arib:" has been devised
   to allow acquiring the current or future scheduled publications of
   broadcast media content from the internet.  These broadcast media

   contents are distributed with the MPEG-2 TS [ISO/IEC 13818-1] on the
   ISDB (Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting) broadcast system,
   which is specified in the [ITU-R BT.1306] and [ITU-R BS.1114].

   The initial intended application is to acquire the digital TV/Radio
   broadcasting programme from the program guide in the internet or the
   digital broadcasting set-top box.

1.  Introduction

   The digital broadcasting service has been available to the home in
   recent years.  With the advent of digital broadcasting, each
   broadcasting program (A/V contents) became identifiable in the
   digital domain.  The TV/Radio broadcasting programme such as
   entertainment or news service providing audio visual content or
   private data module are delivered through the broadband internet as
   well as digital broadcasting.

   The digital broadcasting has made the EPG (Electronic Programming
   Guide) service available by which people are able to search-select
   and acquire the favorite programme.  The EPG also informs the user of
   the most interesting programs that fit specified viewing criteria,
   and the user can check program availability.  This programming guide
   is available to provide on the internet or on the service in the
   digital broadcasting.  As well as the programming guide (EPG) on the
   service in the digital broadcasting, the EPG service on the web is
   also required to identify the actual broadcasted programme material.

   This document defines the "arib" Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
   scheme for audio visual material that is transmitted in the MPEG-2
   systems over ISDB broadcasting mechanism [ITU-R BT.1306] and [ITU-R
   BS.1114] which was standardized in the Association of Radio
   Industries and Businesses (ARIB).  This "arib:" URI is formed in
   conformity with the URI generic syntax [RFC3986] to have high
   affinity with the internet.

2.  Scheme Definition

2.1  The Arib URI Scheme

   The "arib" URI scheme is used to refer to the audio visual material
   transmitted in the MPEG-2 transport stream over ISDB broadcast system
   as it specified in [ITU-R BT.1306] and [ITU-R BS.1114].

   The system overview of the audio/visual transmission mechanism is
   described as follows.  Audio/Visual or Private data components for
   constituting the Radio/TV program (service) compose the MPEG-2
   Transport Stream which is represented in the level 2 of the ISO/OSI
   reference model.  Composed transport stream is transmitted over the
   satellite or terrestrial media in the form of including associated
   service information.

                Conceptual Transmission Model


2.1.1  scheme definition

   The "arib" URI takes the form

      aribURI            = "arib" ":" path

      path               = [ "//" broadcaster_domain ] comp_path

   The comp_path can not start with two slash ("//") characters when
   broadcaster_domain is not present.

2.1.1.1  broadcaster_domain

   < broadcaster_domain > is considered as the unique broadcast
   authority in the domestic digital broadcasting network.  Each
   authority governs name space ( < comp_path >) of their audio visual
   material and private data module.  The broadcaster_domain component,
   consists of a sequence of characters separated by ".", is preceded by
   a double slash ("//") and is terminated by the next slash ("/").

      broadcaster_domain = 0*255 ( unreserved / sub-delims )

      unreserved         = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"



Aoki & Kawamori          Expires August 8, 2005                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft         draft-aoki-arib-uri-01.txt          February 2005


      sub-delims         = "!" / "$" / "&" / "'" / "(" / ")" / "*"
                         / "+" / "," / ";" / "="

   This element (< broadcaster_domain >) consists of unique name in the
   whole digital broadcasting network in the country to which
   administration of the country assigns conforming to the URI.

2.1.1.2  comp_path

   <comp_path> consists of a sequence of characters separated by a slash
   ("/") character for defining the audio visual component tag number
   and private data module ID within the scope of the URI's scheme and
   naming authority (<broadcaster_domain>).

      comp_path          = *( "/" segment )
      segment            = *pchar
      pchar              = unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / ":" / "@"

   This <comp_path> , organized in hierarchical form or the
   non-hierarchical form, serves to identify an audio visual material or
   private data resource in the MPEG-2 system over ISDB digital
   broadcasting mechanism.

3.  Examples

3.1  broadcaster_domain

   The normative description of < broadcaster_domain > corresponds to
   the information of the broadcaster who transmits the broadcasting
   program by the MPEG-2 transport stream.

      broadcaster_domain   = original_network_id "." transport_stream_id
                          "." service_id [ "." event_id ]
                           [ ";" content_id ]

      original_network_id  = 0*6 ( ALPHA / DIGIT )
      transport_stream_id  = 0*6 ( ALPHA / DIGIT )
      service_id           = 0*6 ( ALPHA / DIGIT )
      content_id           = 0*10 ( ALPHA / DIGIT )
      event_id             = 0*6 ( ALPHA / DIGIT )


3.2  Normal examples

   Examples of valid "arib" URI.

   For example, both

      arib://ORIGNT.TSNUMB.SERVCE/FF/0000

   and

      arib://ORIGNT.TSNUMB.SERVCE.EVENT/FF/0000

   The "arib" URI string on which < broadcaster_domain > was omitted, is
   transformed to its target URI with default broadcaster_domain name.

      arib:/FF/0000 = arib://broadcaster_domain/FF/0000


4.  Security Considerations

   The "arib" URI scheme syntax is subject to the same security
   considerations with the generic URI syntax [RFC3986].

   The "arib" URI provides a resolution mechanism to acquire the
   audio/visual data transmitting in MPEG-2 transport stream over ISDB
   system.  The software that resolves "arib" URI for acquiring the
   audio/visual material is supposed to have the function of decoding
   the MPEG-2 transport stream over ISDB broadcast system.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This section provides the information required to register the arib:
   URI scheme with following registration template in accordance with
   [RFC 2717].  The IANA registry for URI schemes should be updated to
   include the arib: URI scheme when the arib: URI scheme is accepted
   for the publication of an RFC.

    Registration Template

         URL scheme name: arib
         URL scheme syntax: Section 2
         Character encoding considerations: conformance with RFC3986,
                                            no special considerations.
         Intended usage: Sections 1
