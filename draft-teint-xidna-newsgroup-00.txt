             An X-IDNA Profile for Network News Group Names
                     draft-teint-xidna-newsgroup-00

Abstract

   Traditional Network News (Netnews) systems handle only ASCII
   characters in newsgroup names used in NNTP commands and message
   headers.

   This memo defines an extension to allow Internationalised Newsgroup
   Names, the characters of which can be drawn from the large Unicode
   repertoire, based on the Extending IDNA to Other Protocols (X-IDNA)
   base specification.

Status of this Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted to IETF in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

Internet-Draft     X-IDNA Profile for Newsgroup Names         March 2010


1.  Introduction

   The X-IDNA base specification ([I-D.teint-xidna-base]) provides a
   generic framework for internationalisation of addresses, based on
   IDNA.  This memo defines an X-IDNA Profile for use with Netnews
   newsgroup names.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  The X-IDNA Profile for Network News Group Names

2.1.  Applicability

   This X-IDNA Profile ([I-D.teint-xidna-base]) applies to newsgroup
   names defined in [RFC3977] and [RFC5536], i.e. to the following
   syntax elements:
   o  the <newsgroup-name> and <wildmat> syntax elements defined in
      Section 9.8 of [RFC3977] (includes the "group" and "wildmat"
      parameters to the "GROUP", "LISTGROUP", "NEWNEWS" and "LIST"
      commands).
   o  the <newsgroup-name> defined in Section 3.1.4 of [RFC5536]
   It also applies to other specifications based on these definitions
   (or their precedessors) if the elements are to be used as newsgroup
   names.

2.2.  Normalisation

   Newsgroup names do not require normalisation.

2.3.  Validation

   Validation of internationalised newsgroup names is the responsibility
   of whoever creates a newsgroup:
   o  for distributed newsgroups, the person sending out the "newgroup"
      and "checkgroup" control messages (Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.3 of
      [RFC5537])
   o  for local newsgroups, the person creating the newsgroup on the
      server

   The following types newsgroup names SHOULD not be created:
   o  newsgroup names containing R-LDH-Labels and fake A-Labels
   o  newsgroup names containing uppercase ASCII characters and extended
      characters

3.  Submitting Messages to Moderators

      This section is non-normative.

   A common method for deriving the email address of the moderator of a
   group, which is described in a NOTE in section 3.5.1 of [RFC5537], is
   forming the submission address for a moderated group by replacing
   each "." in the newsgroup name with "-" and then using that value as
   the <local-part> of a <mailbox> formed by appending a set domain.

   When a forwarding service supports newsgroups the name of which is
   internationalised, they ought to provide two different addresses to
   accomodate both X-IDNA-aware and X-IDNA-unaware users:
   o  the result of replacing "." with "-" in the U-Address form of the
      newsgroup name
   o  the result of replacing "." with "-" in the A-Address form of the
      newsgroup name, which will usually result in fake A-Labels
   NOTE: This method not only produces fake labels, which are
   discouraged in [I-D.teint-xidna-email], but can also produce clashes
   where newsgroup names only differ in "-" and "." characters.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  Visually Similar Characters

   By using visually similar characters, an attacker can create
   newsgroup names that are confusingly similar to other newsgroup names
   and newsgroup hierarchies that are confusingly similar to other
   hierarchies.

   This may not only create a denial of service situation, where
   communication fails because users are tricked into posting into
   different groups, but may also create a leak for information where
   the distribution of the "fake" newsgroup is wider than that of the
   indented group.

   This issue most prominently occurs if a single newsgroup servers
   carries multiple confusingly similar addresses.  However, it can also
   occur if a user agent combines newsgroup lists from multiple servers,
   such as a private intranet NNTP server and a public, less trusted
   server, into a single list.  Furthermore, even if the user agent
   clearly identifies the server carrying the group, users might still
   confuse the newsgroups when they see the familiar name and don't pay
   attention to the server identification.

   It is suggested that Netnews server operators take care not to carry
   hierarchies that exploit confusingly similar newsgroup names.

   In addition, user agent implementations ought to provide visual
   indications where a domain name contains multiple scripts, especially
   when the scripts contain characters that are easily confused
   visually, such as an omicron in Greek mixed with Latin text.

   See Section 4.4 of [I-D.ietf-idnabis-defs] for further information on
   visually similar characters.

5.2.  Other Issues

   See the Security Considerations of [I-D.ietf-idnabis-defs] and
   [I-D.ietf-idnabis-bidi] for information on other issues.
