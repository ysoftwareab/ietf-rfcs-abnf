           Stable iBGP Decision Process with Route-Reflection
                    draft-jakma-idr-stable-bgp-rr-00

Abstract

   This document describes a simple modification to the BGP decision
   process, which solves the issue of oscillation in iBGP seen when
   route-reflection is used.

1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   Route-reflection[RFC4456] is commonly used to enhance the scalability
   of iBGP, by reducing full-meshing requirements.  It is well-known
   that its use can introduce convergence problems, particularly
   oscillations.  Even with coherent intra-AS policy and IGP
   configuration such problems can occur due to the effect of the MED
   attribute[RFC3345].

   This document follows from the work of [Flavel, Roughan] which shows
   iBGP oscillations can be solved by a slight modification to the iBGP
   route selection process, and provably so by the application of the
   routing algebra of [Sobrinho].  Indeed, where iBGP follows the
   underlying topology, (that is, iBGP sessions never transit through
   other iBGP routers) with this modification iBGP provably converges on
   optimal routes.

   [RFC4456] introduces a CLUSTER_LIST attribute, to record which route-
   reflectors a route passes through.  Further, [RFC4456] modifies the
   route decision process described in [RFC4271] to consider the
   CLUSTER_LIST length in between steps f) and g).

   The suggested solution is to instead insert the CLUSTER_LIST tie-
   break step in between b) and c) of [RFC4271].  That is, the iBGP hop-
   count - which CLUSTER_LIST reflects - is used to select between
   routes before considering MEDs.  This ensures that routes are ordered
   such that iBGP will converge, rather than oscillate.

   The semantics of the MED obviously then are weakened as it now can be
   overridden by details of the iBGP topology.  As a consequence
   different speakers within an AS may select different routes to a
   neighbouring AS, where normal [RFC4271] speakers would select the
   same route based on MED values.  This is perhaps a small price to pay
   for having a convergent iBGP, and the preferable outcome for most.
   Further, RR hierarchies can already cause MEDs to be ignored in such
   a way.

   In practical terms, this means MED can no longer can be used where
   ASes wish to distinguish between primary and solely secondary, backup
   links with a neighbour, such that the backup link should normally
   never be used.  Instead, some other mechanism must be used, such as

   community-based preference adjustments.

   This proposal would also affect any cases where MEDs are set on
   ingress as an intra-AS metric for routes with equal AS_PATH lengths #
   to steer traffic to preferred egress points.  Such scenarios would
   imply always comparing MED values, regardless of which neighbouring
   AS a route was received from.  In such cases, presuming MED values
   are never reset when routes are propagated, it is safe to instead put
   the CLUSTER_LIST length check after the MED check.  Safer still would
   be to define a specific attribute to carry an interior egress
   preference metric, to be evaluated after the AS_PATH length and
   defined to be monotonic.


3.  Modifications to BGP Route Reflection

   Section 9 of [RFC4456] describes a new step to be added to the
   [RFC4271] route decision process as follows:

      a BGP Speaker SHOULD prefer a route with the shorter CLUSTER_LIST
      length.  The CLUSTER_LIST length is zero if a route does not carry
      the CLUSTER_LIST attribute.

   [RFC4456] is modified such that the step above is instead inserted
   between steps b and c of [RFC4271].

   Implementations SHOULD provide a means to allow the operator to
   configure whether to use this behaviour, or that of [RFC4456].


4.  Security Considerations

   No new considerations are raised by this document.
