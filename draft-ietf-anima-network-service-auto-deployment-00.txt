    An Autonomic Mechanism for Resource-based Network Services Auto-
                               deployment
          draft-ietf-anima-network-service-auto-deployment-00

Abstract

   This document specifies an autonomic mechanism for resource-based
   network services deployment through the Autonomic Control Plane (ACP)
   in a network.  This mechanism uses the GeneRic Autonomic Signaling
   Protocol (GRASP) in [RFC8990] to exchange the information among the
   autonomic nodes so that the resource along the service path can be
   coordinated.

1.  Introduction

   With the network development, a class of services with resource
   requirements (such as bandwidth, queue, and priority) are already
   emerging, such as video, LR, VR, and so on.  To ensure the normal
   operation of these services, the network needs to divide enough
   resources.  An autonomous network must have an appropriate mechanism
   to negotiate the network resource.

   From the network perspective, this kind of service has a source IP
   address and a destination IP address.  Therefore, once the kind of
   service is delivered by a domain network, this service clearly has an
   access node and a departure node in the network.  In an autonomic
   resources negotiation mechanism, the resources are being negotiated
   between the access node and departure node.  The original purpose of
   this document was to validate the design of the Autonomic Networking
   Infrastructure (ANI) for a realistic use case.  It shows how the ANI
   can be applied to negotiate the resource information for network
   service auto-deployment.

Internet-Draft  An Autonomic Mechanism for Resource-base   December 2021


   The goal of this document is to complete the resource-based self-
   adaptation among service and network nodes via GRASP.  This document
   defines an autonomic technical objective for resource-based network
   services auto-deployment.  The document reduces human operation
   difficulty and avoids the problem of specification limitation and
   slow response in centralized systems, to improve service deployment
   efficiency.  The GeneRic Autonomic Signaling Protocol (GRASP) is
   specified by [RFC8990] and can make use of the technical objective to
   provide a solution for resource-based network services auto-
   deployment.  The present document is to use it for validating the
   design of GRASP and other components of the ANI as described in
   [RFC8993].

3.  Terminology & Abbreviations

   RRM ASA: Requester ResourceManager ASA.  A kind of ResourceManager
   ASA which start to request resource in the network.

   PRM ASA: Provider ResourceManager ASA.  A kind of ResourceManager ASA

   domain scenario.  It may also be a PE node.

4.  Resource-based Network Services Auto-deployment Solution

   This section describes the internal architecture of resource-based
   network services auto-deployment.  As noted in Section 1, this is not
   a complete description of a solution, which will depend on the
   detailed design of the relevant Autonomic Service Agents (ASAs).  It
   uses the generic discovery and negotiation protocol defined by
   [RFC8990] and the relevant GRASP objectives are defined in Section 5.



Dang, et al.              Expires 30 June 2022                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft  An Autonomic Mechanism for Resource-base   December 2021


   The procedures described below are carried out by an ASA in each
   device that participates in the solution.  We will refer to this as
   the ResourceManager ASA.  If a device containing a ResourceManager
   ASA is used up its resource, it can request more resources according
   to its requirements.  It should decide the type and value of the
   requested resource and request it via the mechanism described in
   Section 6.

4.1.  ResourceManager ASA Discovery

   A ResourceManager ASA that needs additional resources should firstly
   discover peers that may be able to provide extra resources.  The ASA
   should send out a GRASP Discovery message that contains a
   ResourceManager Objective option to discover peers also supporting
   that option.

   A GRASP device that receives a Discovery message with a
   ResourceManager Objective option should respond with a GRASP Response
   message if it contains a ResourceManager ASA.  If it does not contain
   ResourceManager ASA, the device ignores this message.  Further
   details of the discovery process are described in Section 2.5.4 of
   [RFC8990].

4.2.  Resource Negotiation

   After the discovery step, the RRM ASA (Requesting ResourceManager
   ASA) will act as a GRASP negotiation initiator by sending a GRASP
   Request message with a ResourceManager Objective option.  The RRM ASA
   indicates in this option the value of the requested resource.  And
   ResourceManager GRASP Objective allows multiple types of resources to
   be requested simultaneously.

   When the PRM ASA (Provider ResourceManager ASA) receives a subsequent
   Request message, it should conduct a GRASP negotiation sequence,
   using Negotiate, Confirm Waiting, and Negotiation End messages as
   appropriate.  The Negotiate messages carry a ResourceManager
   Objective option, which will indicate the resource type and value
   offered to the requesting ASA.

Internet-Draft  An Autonomic Mechanism for Resource-base   December 2021


   During the negotiation, the RRM ASA will decide at each step how
   large a resource needs to offer.  That decision, and the decision to
   end the negotiation, are implementation choices.  As to the PRM ASA
   responses how large resources they can offer and reserve enough
   resources during this negotiation step.  A resource shortage may
   cause a device to indicate the existing available value within a
   ResourceManager Objective option to the RRM ASA.  The RRM ASA
   compares whether the resource data received is the same locally.  If
   they are not the same, the RRM ASA might decide whether to accept the
   request of the resource.  If not, the RRM ASA might terminate the
   negotiation via Negotiation End messages with an error code string.

   As described in Section 2.8.8 of [RFC8990], negotiation will continue
   until either end stops it with a Negotiation End message.  If the
   negotiation succeeds, the ASA that provides the resource will remove
   the negotiated resource from its pool, and the requesting ASA will
   add it.  If the negotiation fails, the party sending the Negotiation
   End message may include an error code string.

4.3.  Behavior after Negotiation

   Upon receiving a GRASP Negotiation End message that indicates that
   the acceptable resource is available.  The resource-providing device
   removes the acceptable resource from its resource pool and the
   requesting device may use the negotiated resource without further
   messages.

5.  Autonomic Resource Management Objectives

   This section defines the GRASP technical objective options that are
   used to support autonomic resource management.

   The ResourceManager Objective option is a GRASP Objective option
   conforming to the GRASP specification [RFC8990].  Its name is
   "ResourceManager", and it carries the following data items as its
   value: the resource value.  Since GRASP is based on CBOR (Concise
   Binary Object Representation) [RFC8949], the format of the
   ResourceManager Objective option is described in the Concise Data
   Definition Language (CDDL) [RFC8610] as follows:

   objective = ["ResourceManager", objective-flags, loop-count,
   [restype, resval]]

   loop-count = 0..255 ; as in the GRASP specification

   objective-flags /= ; as in the GRASP

   resourcetype /= 0...4; requested or offered resource type, such as
   bandwidth, queue, and priority.

   resval /= 1...1000000; If the restype is bandwidth, the value ranges
   in Mbit/s; If the restype is latency, the value ranges in
   microsecond; If the restype is jitter, the value ranges in
   microsecond.

6.  Process of Network Service Auto-deployment

   The network service auto-deployment system includes Service
   Initiator(SI), Service Terminator(ST), RRM ASA, PRM ASA and even
   ASBR.

   The service initiator is the resource demander, which ensures the
   connection of services through negotiation resources with
   ResourceManager ASA in the domain network.  Service Terminator is the
   end of service.  APE represents the first access provider edge where
   the service initiator connects to the network or where the path-
   dependent and resource-based network service starts.  There may be
   multiple Transmit nodes between APE and Service Terminator in the
   network or even cross multiple network domains through ASBRs.  RRM
   ASA starts a negotiation process to get enough resources in the
   network.  After RRM ASA gets the result about the resource, it sends
   a response message to Service Initiator.  And PRM ASA manages
   resources from APE to ST hop-by-hop.

6.1.  An example of End-to-End Service

   In an End-to-End service, Service Initiator is a kind of access
   terminal of the network.  And the End-to-End service initiator uses
   ResourceManager ASA to negotiate resources with the ResourceManager
   ASA in the APE.  Figure 2 shows the architecture of the End-to-End
   service.  In the figure, the RRM ASA in SI will act as a GRASP
   negotiation initiator by sending a GRASP Request message with a
   ResourceManager Objective option.  The RRM ASA indicates in this
   option the value of the requested resource.  When this RRM ASA
   receives a subsequent Request message, it should conduct a GRASP
   negotiation sequence, using Negotiate, Confirm Waiting, and
   Negotiation End messages as appropriate.  The Negotiate messages
   carry a ResourceManager Objective option with the resource value
   offered to the PRM ASA.

   +---------+ Negotiation Resource  +---------+
   | RRM ASA |<--------------------->| PRM ASA |
   +---------+                       +---------+    +------+    +------+
   |   SI    | --------------------->|   APE   |--->| Node |--->|  ST  |
   +---------+   Transmit data       +---------+    +------+    +------+

   Figure-1: An example of End-to-End Service

   PRM ASA processes receive resource requests and ensure the nodes
   resource it can manage.  If PRM ASA can't manage all nodes in the
   data transport root or can't have enough resources, PRM ASA should
   act as a GRASP negotiation initiator to negotiate resources with
   other ASA in the network.

   When the RRM ASA receives a Negotiation response message, it should
   check whether the resource value within the Negotiate message is the
   same as the resource value requested.  If it is the same, the RRM ASA
   should send GRASP Negotiation End messages indicating that the
   negotiation was successful.  If it is not the same, the RRM ASA
   should communicate with Service Initiator about the result and decide
   whether to accept this negotiation.  If accepting this negotiation,
   RRM ASA should send GRASP Negotiation End messages indicating that
   the negotiation was successful.  If not accepting this negotiation,
   it should send GRASP Negotiation End messages indicating that the
   negotiation fails.

6.2.  An example of multiple rounds

   In the process of automatic resource management mechanism, RRM ASA
   and PRM ASA are allowed to negotiate resources for multiple rounds.
   A very common situation is that the network resources can not meet
   the resources required by the service, but the service is willing to
   reduce its resource requirements to ensure the successful deployment
   of the service.  The PRM ASA using Resource Management Objectives
   contains the resources that the network can provide to the service at
   present in the response message.  The RRM ASA changes the resource
   requirements according to the specific requirements of the received
   resources and services, to carry out the next round of service
   negotiation.

6.3.  An example of multiple domain network

   In a multiple network, PRM ASA doesn't have the resource status of
   other domains.  So PRM ASA should negotiate with ASBR PRM ASA before
   response RRM ASA.  The PRM ASA should send a Confirm Waiting message
   to the RRM ASA, to extend its timeout.  When the new resource becomes
   available confirmed by ASBR, the PRM ASA responds with a GRASP
   Negotiate message with a resource value offered.  The process as
   Figure 2 shows.  The Confirm Waiting message is described in
   Section 2.8.9 of [RFC8990].

            Negotiation message
            <----------------------

   Other processes between APE and ASBR are the same as between Service
   Initiator and APE.

7.  Compatibility with Other Technologies

   A gateway device is used between the GRASP network and the MPLS
   network.  As is known, the RSVP belongs to the distribution mechanism
   for resource reservation, but it is only coupled with MPLS.  Then
   this device uses the GRASP protocol in the GRASP network, and the
   MPLS protocol in the MPLS network, so that resource information can
   be shared.

8.  Security Considerations

   It complies with GRASP security considerations.  Relevant security
   issues are discussed in [RFC8990].  The preferred security model is
   that devices are trusted following the secure bootstrap procedure
   [RFC8995] and that a secure Autonomic Control Plane (ACP) [RFC8994]
   is in place.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new GRASP Objective option names:
   "ResourceManager" which is need to be added to the "GRASP Objective
   Names" registry.
