Abstract

   This document defines an XML format for the representation of civic
   location.  This format is designed for use with PIDF Location Object
   (PIDF-LO) documents.  The format is based on the civic address
   definition in PIDF-LO, but adds several new elements based on the
   civic types defined for DHCP, and adds a hierarchy to address complex
   road identity schemes.  The format also includes support for the
   xml:lang language tag and restricts the types of elements where
   appropriate.

Internet-Draft              Revised Civic LO                  April 2006


1.  Introduction

   Since the publication of the original PIDF-LO civic specification, in
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-pidf-lo], it has been found that the specification
   is lacking a number of additional parameters that can be used to more
   precisely specify a civic location.  These additional parameters have
   been largely captured in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-dhcp-civil].

   This document revises the GEOPRIV civic form to include the
   additional civic parameters captured in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-dhcp-
   civil].  The document also introduces a hierarchical structure for
   thoroughfare (road) identification which is employed in some
   countries.  New elements are defined to allow for even more precision
   in specifying a civic location.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The term "thoroughfare" is used in this document to describe a road
   or part of a road or other access route along which a final point is
   identified.  This is consistent with the definition used in [UPU-
   S42].

3.  Changes from PIDF-LO

3.1.  Additional Civic Address Types

   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-dhcp-civil] provides a full set of parameters that
   may used to describe a civic location.  Specifically [I-D.ietf-
   geopriv-dhcp-civil] lists several civic address types (CAtypes) that
   require support in the formal PIDF-LO definition that are not in
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-pidf-lo].

   These changes include and new elements that are required to support
   more complex structures for naming street addresses, this is
   described in more detail in Section 3.2.

Internet-Draft              Revised Civic LO                  April 2006


   Building: The "building" (BLD) conveys the name of a single building
      if the street address includes more than one building or the
      building name is helpful in identifying the location.  (For
      example, on university campuses, the house number is often not
      displayed on buildings, while the building name is prominently
      shown.)

   Unit: The "unit" (UNIT) contains the name or number of a part of a
      structure where there are separate administrative units, owners or
      tenants, such as separate companies or families who occupy that
      structure.  Common examples include suite or apartment
      designations.

   Room: A "room" (ROOM) is the smallest identifiable subdivision of a
      structure.

   Place type: The "type of place" element (PLC) describes the type of
      place described by the civic coordinates.  For example, it
      describes whether it is a home, office, street or other public
      space.  The values are drawn from the items in the location types
      registry [I-D.ietf-geopriv-location-types-registry].  This
      information makes it easy, for example, for the DHCP client to
      then populate the presence information.

   Post office box: The "post office box" element (POBOX) describes a
      container, such as a pigeon hole, at a central mailing location,
      where mail is held.

   Additional code: The "additional code" item (ADDCODE) provides an
      additional, country-specific code identifying the location.  For
      example, for Japan, it contains the Japan Industry Standard (JIS)
      address code.  The JIS address code provides a unique address
      inside of Japan, down to the level of indicating the floor of the
      building.

   Seat: The "seat" element (SEAT) describes a single place where a
      person might sit.  Common examples include a seat in a theatre and
      a cubicle in a cube farm.

   Primary Road Name: The "primary road name" item (RD) is the name
      given to the root road or street associated with the address.  In
      many cases this will the name of the road or street on which an
      office or house exists, in some cases it will be the name of road
      or street from which more granular information stems.  In most
      countries, this field should be used in preference to the "A6"
      element, which was previously used for street information.

Internet-Draft              Revised Civic LO                  April 2006


   Road Section: The "road section" item (RDSEC) is an identifier that
      represents a specific section or stretch of a primary road.  This
      is a new thoroughfare element and is useful where a primary road
      reuses street numbering, or branch street names and there is no
      other way to identify that this has occurred, such as a change in
      municipality or suburb.

   Branch Road Name: The "branch road name" item (RDBR) represents the
      name or identifier of a road/street that intersects or is
      associated with a primary road.  The road branch is a new
      thoroughfare element and is envisaged being used where branch
      roads along a primary road reuse names and there is no other way,
      other than the road section (RDSEC) identifier, to discern a
      difference between them, such as a change in municipality or
      suburb.

   Sub-Branch Road Name: The "sub-branch road name" item (RDSUBBR)
      represents the name or identifier of a road/street that intersects
      or is associated with a branch road (RDBR).  The road sub-branch
      is a new thoroughfare element and is envisaged being used where
      sub-branch roads reuse names and there is no way, other than the
      road section (RDSEC) identifier, to discern a difference between
      them, such as a change in municipality or suburb.

   Road Pre-Modifier: The "road pre-modifier" item (PRM) is an optional
      element of the complete street name.  It is a word or phrase that
      precedes all other elements of the street name and modifies it,
      but is separated from the street name by a street name pre-
      directional.  An example is "Old" in "Old North First Street".

   Road Post-Modifier: The "road post-modifier" item (POM) is an
      optional element of the complete street name.  It is a word or
      phrase that follows all other elements of the street name and
      modifies it, but is separated from the street name by a street
      name post-directional and/or street suffix.  An example is
      "Extended" in "East End Avenue Extended".

3.2.  New Thoroughfare Elements

   In some countries a thoroughfare can be broken up into sections, and
   it is not uncommon for street numbers to be repeated between
   sections.  A road section identifier is required to ensure that an
   address is unique.  For example, "West Alice Parade" has 5 sections,
   each numbered from 1; unless the section is specified "7 West Alice
   Parade" could exist in 5 different places.  The "RDSEC" element is
   used to specify the section.

   Minor streets can share the same name, so that they can only be



Thomson & Winterbottom  Expires October 30, 2006                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft              Revised Civic LO                  April 2006


   distinguished by the major thoroughfare with which they intersect.
   For example, both "West Alice Parade, Section 3" and "Bob Street"
   could both be interested by a "Carol Lane".  The "RDBR" element is
   used to specify a road branch where the name of the branch does not
   uniquely identify the road.  Road branches MAY also be used where a
   major thoroughfare is split into sections.

   Similar to the way that a road branch is associated with a road, a
   road sub-branch is associated with a road branch.  The "RDSUBBR"
   element is used to identify road sub-branches.

   The "A6" element is retained for use in those countries that require
   this level of detail.  Where "A6" was previously used for street
   names, it MUST NOT be used, the "RD" element MUST be used for
   thoroughfare data.

   The following example figure shows a fictional arrangement of roads
   where these new thoroughfare elements are applicable.

                                           |               ||

3.2.1.  Street Numbering

   The introduction of new thoroughfare elements affects the
   interpretation of several of more specific civic address data.  In
   particular, street numbering (the "HNO" element) applies to the most
   specific road element specified.  That is, the first specified
   element from: "RDSUBBR", "RDBR", "RDSEC", or "RD".

3.2.2.  Directionals and other Qualifiers

   The "PRM", "POM", "PRD", "POD" and "STS" elements always apply to the
   value of the "RD" element only.  If road branches or sub-branches
   require street suffixes or qualifiers, they MUST be included in the
   "RDBR" or "RDSUBBR" element text.

Internet-Draft              Revised Civic LO                  April 2006


3.3.  Country Element

   The "country" element differs from that defined in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-
   pidf-lo] in that it now restricts the value space of the element to
   two upper case characters, which correspond to the alpha-2 codes in
   [ISO.3166-1].

3.4.  A1 Element

   The "A1" element is used for the top level subdivision within a
   country.  In the absence of a country-specific guide on how to use
   the A-series of elements, the second part of the ISO 3166-2 code
   [ISO.3166-2] for a country subdivision SHOULD be used.  The ISO
   3166-2 code is a formed of a country code and hyphen plus a code of
   one, two or three characters or numerals.  For the "A1" element, the
   leading country code and hyphen are omitted and only the subdivision
   code is included.

   For example, the codes for Canada include CA-BC, CA-ON, CA-QC;
   Luxembourg has just three single character codes: LU-D, LU-G and
   LU-L; Australia uses both two and three character codes: AU-ACT, AU-
   NSW, AU-NT; France uses numerical codes for mainland France and
   letters for territories: FR-75, FR-NC.  This results in the following
   fragments:

      <country>CA</country><A1>ON</A1>

      <country>LU</country><A1>L</A1>

      <country>AU</country><A1>ACT</A1>

      <country>FR</country><A1>75</A1>

3.5.  Languages and Scripts

   The XML schema defined for civic addresses allows for the addition of
   the "xml:lang" attribute to all elements except "country" and "PLC",
   which both contain enumerated values.

   The "script" field defined in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-dhcp-civil] is
   omitted in favour of using the "xml:lang" attribute.

   It is RECOMMENDED that each "civicAddress" element use one language
   only, or a combination of languages that is consistent.  Where a
   civic location is represented in multiple languages multiple
   "civicAddress" elements SHOULD be included in the PIDF-LO document.

Internet-Draft              Revised Civic LO                  April 2006


3.6.  Whitespace

   The XML schema [W3C.REC-xmlschema-2-20041028] defined in Section 4
   uses a base type of "token" instead of "string" as used in [I-D.ietf-
   geopriv-pidf-lo].

   The "token" type ensures that whitespace within instance documents is
   normalized and collapsed before being passed to a processor.  This
   ensures that the following fragments are considered equivalent by XML
   processors:

   <A4>North Wollongong</A4>

   <A1>North
     Wollongong</A1>

   <A1>
     North   Wollongong
     </A1>

   Whitespace may still be included in values by using character
   references, such as "&#x20;".

6.  Security Considerations

   The XML representation described in this document is designed for
   inclusion in a PIDF-LO document.  As such, it is subject to the same
   security considerations as are described in
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-pidf-lo].  Considerations relating to the inclusion
   of this representation in other XML documents are outside the scope
   of this document.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  URN sub-namespace registration for
      'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10:civicAddr'

   This document calls for IANA to register a new XML namespace, as per
   the guidelines in [RFC3688].

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10:civicAddr

   Registrant Contact: IETF, GEOPRIV working group (geopriv@ietf.org),
      Martin Thomson (martin.thomson@andrew.com).

   XML:

         BEGIN
           <?xml version="1.0"?>
           <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
             "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
           <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en">
             <head>
               <title>GEOPRIV Civic Address</title>
             </head>
             <body>
               <h1>Format for Distributing Civic Address in GEOPRIV</h1>
               <h2>urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10:civicAddr</h2>
   [[NOTE TO IANA/RFC-EDITOR: Please update RFC URL and replace XXXX
       with the RFC number for this specification.]]
               <p>See <a href="[[RFC URL]]">RFCXXXX</a>.</p>
             </body>
           </html>
         END

7.2.  XML Schema Registration

   This section registers an XML schema as per the procedures in
   [RFC3688].

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:pidf:geopriv10:civicAddr

   Registrant Contact: IETF, GEOPRIV working group, (geopriv@ietf.org),
      Martin Thomson (martin.thomson@andrew.com).

      The XML for this schema can be found as the entirety of Section 4
      of this document.
