Abstract

   The purpose of this document is to define a framework for an Access
   Node Control Mechanism between a Network Access Server (NAS) and an
   Access Node (e.g. a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer
   (DSLAM)) in a multi-service reference architecture in order to
   perform QoS-related, service-related and Subscriber-related
   operations.  The Access Node Control Mechanism will ensure that the
   transmission of the information does not need to go through distinct
   element managers but rather using a direct device-device
   communication.  This allows for performing access link related
   operations within those network elements, while avoiding impact on
   the existing OSS systems.

1.  Introduction

   Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) technology is widely deployed for
   Broadband Access for Next Generation Networks.  Several documents
   like DSL Forum TR-058 [TR-058], DSL Forum TR-059 [TR-059] and DSL
   Forum TR-101 [TR-101] describe possible architectures for these
   access networks.  In the scope of these specifications is the
   delivery of voice, video and data services.  The framework defined by
   this document is targeted at DSL-based access (either by means of
   ATM/DSL or as Ethernet/DSL).

   Traditional architectures require permanent virtual circuit(s) per
   Subscriber.  Such virtual circuit is configured on layer 2 and
   terminated at the first layer 3 device (e.g.  Broadband Remote Access
   Server (BRAS)).  Beside the data plane, the models define the
   architectures for element, network and service management.  But due
   to organizational boundaries between departments operating the local
   loop, departments operating the ATM network, and departments
   operating the IP network interworking at the management plane is not
   always possible.  Besides, management networks are usually not
   designed to transmit management data between the different entities
   in real time.

   When deploying value-added services across DSL access networks,
   special attention regarding quality of service and service control is
   required, which implies a tighter coordination between Network Nodes
   (e.g.  Access Nodes and NAS), without burdening the OSS layer with
   unpractical expectations.

   Therefore, there is a need for an Access Node Control Mechanism
   between a Network Access Server (NAS) and an Access Node (e.g. a
   Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM)) in a multi-
   service reference architecture in order to perform QoS-related,
   service-related and Subscriber-related operations.  The Access Node
   Control Mechanism will ensure that the transmission of the
   information does not need to go through distinct element managers but
   rather using a direct device-device communication.  This allows for
   performing access link related operations within those network
   elements, while avoiding impact on the existing OSS systems.

   This document provides a framework for such an Access Node Control
   Mechanism and identifies a number of use cases for which this
   mechanism can be justified.  Next, it presents a number of
   requirements for the Access Node Control Protocol (ANCP) and the
   network elements that need to support it.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Definitions

   o  Access Node (AN): Network device, usually located at a service
      provider central office or street cabinet, that terminates Access
      Loop connections from Subscribers.  In case the Access Loop is a
      Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), this is often referred to as a DSL
      Access Multiplexer (DSLAM).

   o  Network Access Server (NAS): Network device which aggregates
      multiplexed Subscriber traffic from a number of Access Nodes.  The
      NAS plays a central role in per-subscriber policy enforcement and
      QoS.  Often referred to as a Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) or
      Broadband Remote Access Server (BRAS).  A detailed definition of
      the NAS is given in [RFC2881].

   o  Net Data Rate: defined by ITU-T G.993.2, section 3.39, i.e. the
      portion of the total data rate that can be used to transmit user
      information (e.g.  ATM cells or Ethernet frames).  It excludes
      overhead that pertains to the physical transmission mechanism
      (e.g. trellis coding in case of DSL)

   o  Line Rate: the total data rate including overhead

   o  Access Node Control Mechanism: a method for multiple network
      scenarios with an extensible communication scheme that conveys
      status and control information between one or more ANs and one or
      more NASs without using intermediate element managers.

   o  Control Channel: a bidirectional IP communication interface
      between the controller function (in the NAS) and the reporting/
      enforcement function (in the AN).

   o  Access Node Control Session: an instantiation of ANCP running on
      top of the Control Channel.

2.  General Architecture Aspects

   In this section first the concept of the Access Node Control
   Mechanism is described.  Then, the reference architecture is
   described where the Access Node Control Mechanism is introduced.

2.1.  Concept of an Access Node Control Mechanism

   The high-level communication framework for an Access Node Control
   Mechanism is defined in Figure 1.  The Access Node Control Mechanism
   defines a general-purpose method for multiple network scenarios with
   an extensible communication scheme, addressing the different use
   cases that are described throughout this document.

                                Control Responses

     <---------><------------------------------------->

                                 Figure 1

   From a functional perspective, a number of functions can be
   identified:

   o  A controller function: this function is used to either send out
      requests for information to be used by the network element where
      the controller function resides, or to trigger a certain behavior
      in the network element where the reporting and/or enforcement



Ooghe, et al.            Expires April 16, 2007                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft               ANCP Framework                 October 2006


      function resides;

   o  A reporting and/or enforcement function: the reporting function is
      used to convey status information to the controller function that
      requires the information for executing local functions.  An
      example of this is the transmission of an Access Loop data rate
      from an Access Node to a Network Access Server (NAS) tasked with
      shaping traffic to that rate.  The enforcement function can be
      contacted by the controller function to trigger a local action.
      An example of this is the initiation of a port testing mechanism
      on an Access Node.

   The use cases in this document are described in an abstract way,
   independent from any actual protocol mapping.  The actual protocol
   specification is out of scope of this document, but there are certain
   characteristics of the protocol required such as to simplify
   specification, implementation, debugging & troubleshooting, but also
   to be easily extensible in order to support additional use cases.

2.2.  Reference Architecture

   The reference architecture used in this document can be based on ATM
   or Ethernet access/aggregation.  Specifically:

   o  In case of a legacy ATM aggregation network that is to be used for
      the introduction of new QoS-enabled IP services, the architecture
      builds on the reference architecture specified in DSL Forum
      [TR-059];

   o  In case of an Ethernet aggregation network that supports new QoS-
      enabled IP services (including Ethernet multicast replication),
      the architecture builds on the reference architecture specified in
      DSL Forum [TR-101].

   Given the industry's move towards Ethernet as the new access and
   aggregation technology for triple play services, the primary focus
   throughout this document is on a TR-101 architecture.  However the
   concepts are equally applicable to an ATM architecture based on TR-
   059.

2.2.1.  Home Gateway

   The Home Gateway (HGW) connects the different Customer Premises
   Equipment (CPE) to the Access Node and the access network.  In case
   of DSL, the HGW is a DSL Network Termination (NT) that could either
   operate as a layer 2 bridge or as a layer 3 router.  In the latter
   case, such a device is also referred to as a Routing Gateway (RG).

Internet-Draft               ANCP Framework                 October 2006


2.2.2.  Access Loop

   The Access Loop ensures physical connectivity between the Network
   Interface Device (NID) at the customer premises, and the Access Node.
   Legacy protocol encapsulations use multi-protocol encapsulation over
   AAL5, defined in RFC2684.  This covers PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE,
   defined in RFC2516), bridged IP (IPoE) and routed IP (IPoA, defined
   in RFC2225).  Next to this, PPPoA as defined in RFC2364 can be used.
   Future scenarios include cases where the Access Loop supports direct
   Ethernet encapsulation (e.g. when using VDSL).

2.2.3.  Access Node

   The Access Node (AN) is a network device, usually located at a
   service provider central office or street cabinet, that terminates
   Access Loop connections from Subscribers.  In case the Access Loop is
   a Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), this is often referred to as a DSL
   Access Multiplexer (DSLAM).  The AN may support one or more Access
   Loop technologies and allow them to inter-work with a common
   aggregation network technology.

   Besides the Access Loop termination the AN can also aggregate traffic
   from other Access Nodes using ATM or Ethernet.

   The framework defined by this document is targeted at DSL-based
   access (either by means of ATM/DSL or as Ethernet/DSL).  The
   framework shall be open to non-DSL technologies, like Passive Optical
   Networks (PON) and IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX), but the details of this are
   outside the scope of this document.

   The reporting and/or enforcement function defined in Section 2.1
   typically resides in an Access Node.

2.2.4.  Access Node uplink

   The fundamental requirements for the Access Node uplink are to
   provide traffic aggregation, Class of Service distinction and
   customer separation and traceability.  This can be achieved using an
   ATM or an Ethernet based technology.

2.2.5.  Aggregation Network

   The aggregation network provides traffic aggregation towards the NAS.
   The aggregation technology can be based on ATM (in case of a TR-059
   architecture) or Ethernet (in case of a TR-101 architecture).

2.2.6.  Network Access Server

   The NAS is a network device which aggregates multiplexed Subscriber
   traffic from a number of Access Nodes.  The NAS plays a central role
   in per-subscriber policy enforcement and QoS.  It is often referred
   to as a Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) or Broadband Remote Access
   Server (BRAS).  A detailed definition of the NAS is given in RFC2881.

   The NAS interfaces to the aggregation network by means of standard
   ATM or Ethernet interfaces, and towards the regional broadband
   network by means of transport interfaces for Ethernet frames (e.g.
   GigE, Ethernet over SONET).  The NAS functionality correpsonds to the
   BNG functionality described in DSL Forum TR-101.  In addition to
   this, the NAS supports the Access Node Control functionality defined
   for the respective use cases throughout this document.

   The controller function defined in Section 2.1 typically resides in a
   NAS.

2.2.7.  Regional Network

   The Regional Network connects one or more NAS and associated Access
   Networks to Network Service Providers (NSPs) and Application Service
   Providers (ASPs).  The NSP authenticates access and provides and
   manages the IP address to Subscribers.  It is responsible for overall
   service assurance and includes Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
   The ASP provides application services to the application Subscriber
   (gaming, video, content on demand, IP telephony etc.).

   The Regional Network supports aggregation of traffic from multiple
   Access Networks and hands off larger geographic locations to NSPs and
   ASPs - relieving a potential requirement for them to build
   infrastructure to attach more directly to the various Access
   Networks.

2.3.  Access Node Control Mechanism Transport methods

   The connectivity between the Access Node and the NAS may differ
   depending on the actual layer 2 technology used (ATM or Ethernet).
   Therefore the identification of unicast & multicast flows/channels
   will also differ (see also Section 2.4.1).

   In case of an ATM access/aggregation network, the Access Node Control
   Messages are sent over a dedicated Permanent Virtual Circuit (PVC)
   configured between the AN and the NAS.  These ATM PVCs should be
   given a high priority (e.g. by using a Constant Bitrate (CBR)
   connection) so that the ATM cells carrying the Access Node Control
   Messages are not lost in the event of congestion.  It is discouraged

   to route the Access Node Control Messages within the VP that also
   carries the customer connections, if that VP is configured with a
   best effort QoS class (e.g.  Unspecified Bitrate (UBR)).  The PVCs of
   multiple Access Node Control sessions can be routed into a Virtual
   Path (VP) that is given a high priority and runs across the
   aggregation network.  This requires the presence of a VC cross-
   connect in the aggregation node that terminates the VP.

   In case of an Ethernet access/aggregation network, the Access Node
   Control Messages are sent over a dedicated Ethernet Virtual LAN
   (VLAN) using a separate VLAN identifier.  Depending on penetration
   and network design, this can be a simple VLAN for each Access Node
   or, for higher-grade connections and bundling, one Customer VLAN
   (C-VLAN) for each Access Node and one Service VLAN (S-VLAN) for all
   the control sessions of every Access Node.  These VLANs should be
   given a high priority (e.g. by using a high Class of Service (CoS)
   value) so that the Ethernet frames carrying the Access Node Control
   Messages are not lost in the event of congestion.

   The Control Channel between NAS and Access Node uses the same
   physical network- and routing resources as the Subscriber traffic.
   This means that the connection is an inband connection between the
   involved network elements.  Therefore there is no need for an
   additional physical interface to establish the Control Channel.

   The control plane interactions are transactional in nature and imply
   a reliable communication channel to share states.  Bidirectional
   operations are needed, as well as dynamic negotiation of capabilities
   to address transition issues.

2.4.  Operation and Management

   When introducing an Access Node Control Mechanism, care is needed to
   ensure that the existing management mechanisms remain operational as
   before.

   Specifically when using the Access Node Control Mechanism for
   performing a configuration action on a network element, one gets
   confronted with the challenge of supporting multiple managers for the
   same network element: both the Element Manager as well as the Access
   Node Control Mechanism may now perform configuration actions on the
   same network element.  Conflicts therefore need to be avoided.

   Also, when using the Access Node Control Mechanism for performing a
   reporting action, there is a possibility to integrate this with a
   central Policy Management system that keeps track of the different
   Subscriber related parameters (e.g.  Access Loop net data rate).

2.4.1.  Port Addressing Scheme

   In deployments using an ATM aggregation network, the ATM PVC on an
   Access Loop connects the Subscriber to a NAS.  Based on such
   property, in a PPP scenario, the NAS typically includes a NAS-Port-Id
   (or NAS-Port in some cases) attribute in RADIUS authentication &
   accounting packets sent to the RADIUS server(s).  Such attribute
   includes the identification of the ATM VC for this Subscriber, which
   allows in turn identifying the Access Loop.

   In an Ethernet-based aggregation network, the port addressing scheme
   is defined in TR-101.  Two mechanisms can be used:

   o  A first approach is to use a one-to-one VLAN assignment model for
      all DSL ports.  This allows the Access Loop identification to be
      directly derived from the VLAN tagging, i.e.  S-VLAN ID or <S-VLAN
      ID, C-VLAN ID> pair, of the frames coming from this Access Loop;

   o  A second approach is to use a many-to-one VLAN assignment model
      and to encode the Access Loop identification in the "Agent Circuit
      ID" sub-option to be added to a DHCP or PPPoE message.  The
      details of this approach are specified in TR-101.

   This document reuses the port addressing scheme specified in TR-101.
   It should be noted however that the use of such a scheme does not
   imply the actual existence of a PPPoE or DHCP session, nor on the
   specific interworking function present in the Access Node.  In some
   cases, no PPPoE or DHCP session may be present, while the port
   addressing would still be desirable.

3.  Use Cases for Access Node Control Mechanism

3.1.  Dynamic Access Loop Attributes

   [TR-059] and [TR-101] discuss various queuing/scheduling mechanisms
   to avoid congestion in the access network while dealing with multiple
   flows with distinct QoS requirements.  Such mechanisms require that
   the NAS gains knowledge about the topology of the access network, the
   various links being used and their respective rates.  Some of the
   information required is somewhat dynamic in nature (e.g.  DSL actual
   data rate, also known as the "DSL sync rate"), hence cannot come from
   a provisioning and/or inventory management OSS system.  Some of the
   information varies less frequently (e.g. capacity of a DSLAM uplink),
   but nevertheless needs to be kept strictly in sync between the actual
   capacity of the uplink and the image the BRAS has of it.

   OSS systems are rarely able to enforce in a reliable and scalable
   manner the consistency of such data, notably across organizational
   boundaries.  The Access Port Discovery function allows the NAS to
   perform these advanced functions without having to depend on an
   error-prone & possibly complex integration with an OSS system.

   Communicating Access Loop attributes is specifically important in
   case the rate of the Access Loop changes overtime.  The DSL actual
   data rate may be different every time the DSL NT is turned on.
   Additionally, during the time the DSL NT is active, data rate changes
   can occur due to environmental conditions (the DSL Access Loop can
   get "out of sync" and can retrain to a lower value, or the DSL Access
   Loop could use Seamless Rate Adaptation making the actual data rate
   fluctuate while the line is active).

   The hierarchy and the rates of the various links to enable the NAS
   hierarchical scheduling and policing mechanisms are the following:

   o  The identification and speed (data rate) of the DSL Access Loop
      (also known as the "DSL sync rate")

   o  The identification and speed (data rate) of the Remote
      Terminal(RT)/Access Node link (when relevant)

   The NAS can adjust downstream shaping to current Access Loop actual
   data rate, and more generally re-configure the appropriate nodes of
   its hierarchical scheduler (support of advanced capabilities
   according to TR-101).

   This use case may actually include more information than link
   identification and corresponding data rates.  In case of DSL Access
   Loops, the following Access Loop characteristics can be sent to the

Internet-Draft               ANCP Framework                 October 2006


   NAS (cf. ITU-T Recommendation G.997.1 [G.997.1]):

   o  DSL Type (e.g.  ADSL1, ADSL2, SDSL, ADSL2+, VDSL, VDSL2)

   o  Framing mode (e.g.  ATM, ITU-T Packet Transfer Mode (PTM), IEEE
      802.3 Ethernet in the First Mile (EFM))

   o  DSL port state (e.g. synchronized/showtime, low power, no power/
      idle)

   o  Actual net data rate (upstream/downstream)

   o  Maximum achievable/attainable data rate (upstream/downstream)

   o  Minimum data rate configured for the Access Loop (upstream/
      downstream)

   o  Maximum data rate configured for the Access Loop (upstream/
      downstream)

   o  Minimum data rate in low power state configured for the Access
      Loop (upstream/downstream)

   o  Maximum achievable interleaving delay (upstream/downstream)

   o  Actual interleaving delay (upstream/downstream)

   The NAS MUST be able to receive Access Loop characteristics
   information, and share such information with AAA/policy servers.

3.2.  Access Loop Configuration

   Access Loop rates are typically configured in a static way.  If a
   Subscriber wants to change its Access Loop rate, this requires an
   OPEX intensive reconfiguration of the access port configuration via
   the network operator, possibly implying a business-to-business
   transaction between an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and an Access
   Provider.

   Using the Access Node Control Mechanism to change the Access Loop
   rate from the NAS avoids those cross-organization business-to-
   business interactions and allows to centralize Subscriber-related
   service data in e.g. a policy server.  More generally, several Access
   Loop parameters (e.g. minimum data rate, interleaving delay) could be
   changed by means of the Access Node Control Mechanism.

   Triggered by the communication of the Access Loop attributes
   described in Section 3.1, the NAS could query a policy server (e.g.



Ooghe, et al.            Expires April 16, 2007                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft               ANCP Framework                 October 2006


   RADIUS server) to retrieve Access Loop configuration data.  The best
   way to change Access Loop parameters is by using profiles.  These
   profiles (e.g.  DSL profiles for different services) are pre-
   configured by the Element Manager managing the Access Nodes.  The NAS
   may then use the Configure Request message to send a reference to the
   right profile to the Access Node.  The NAS may also update the Access
   Loop configuration due to a Subscriber service change (e.g. triggered
   by the policy server).

   The Access Loop Configuration mechanism may also be useful for
   configuration of parameters that are not specific to the Access Loop
   technology.  Examples include the QoS profile to be used for an
   Access Loop, or the per-Subscriber multicast channel entitlement
   information, used for IPTV applications where the Access Node is
   performing IGMP snooping or IGMP proxy function.  The latter is also
   discussed in Section 3.4.

3.3.  Remote Connectivity Test

   Traditionally, ATM circuits are point to point connections between
   the BRAS and the DSLAM or DSL NT.  In order to test the connectivity
   on layer 2, appropriate OAM functionality is used for operation and
   troubleshooting.  An end-to-end OAM loopback is performed between the
   edge devices (NAS and HGW) of the broadband access network.

   When migrating to an Ethernet-based aggregation network (as defined
   by TR-101), end to end ATM OAM functionality is no longer applicable.
   Ideally in an Ethernet aggregation network, end-to-end Ethernet OAM
   as specified in IEEE 802.1ag and ITU-T Recommendation Y.1730/1731 can
   provide Access Loop connectivity testing and fault isolation.
   However, most HGWs do not yet support these standard Ethernet OAM
   procedures.  Also, various access technologies exist such as ATM/DSL,
   Ethernet in the First Mile (EFM) etc.  Each of these access
   technologies have their own link-based OAM mechanisms that have been
   or are being standardized in different standard bodies.

   In a mixed Ethernet and ATM access network (including the local
   loop), it is desirable to keep the same ways to test and troubleshoot
   connectivity as those used in an ATM based architecture.  To reach
   consistency with the ATM based approach, an Access Node Control
   Mechanism between NAS and Access Node can be used until end-to-end
   Ethernet OAM mechanisms are more widely available.

   Triggered by a local management interface, the NAS can use the Access
   Node Control Mechanism to initiate an Access Loop test between Access
   Node and HGW.  In case of an ATM based Access Loop the Access Node
   Control Mechanism can trigger the Access Node to generate ATM (F4/F5)
   loopback cells on the Access Loop.  In case of Ethernet, the Access

Internet-Draft               ANCP Framework                 October 2006


   Node can perform a port synchronization and administrative test for
   the access loop.  The Access Node can send the result of the test to
   the NAS via a Subscriber Response message.  The NAS may then send the
   result via a local management interface.  Thus, the connectivity
   between the NAS and the HGW can be monitored by a single trigger
   event.

3.4.  Multicast

   With the rise of supporting IPTV services in a resource efficient
   way, multicast services are getting increasingly important.  This
   especially holds for an Ethernet-based access/aggregation
   architecture.  In such a architecture, the Access Node, aggregation
   node(s) and the NAS are involved in the multicast replication
   process, thereby avoiding that serveral copies of the same stream are
   sent within the network.

   Typically IGMP is used to control the multicast content replication
   process within the access/aggregation network.  This is achieved by
   means of IGMP snooping or IGMP proxy in the Access Node, aggregation
   node(s) and the NAS.  However, a Subscriber's policy and
   configuration for multicast traffic might only be known at the NAS.
   The Access Node Control Mechanism could be used to exchange the
   necessary information between the Access Node and the NAS so as to
   allow the Access Node to perform multicast replication in line with
   the Subscriber's policy and configuration, and also allow the NAS to
   follow each Subscriber's multicast group membership.

4.  Requirements

4.1.  ANCP Functional Requirements

   o  The ANCP MUST address all use cases described in this document,
      and be general-purpose and extensible enough to foresee additional
      use cases (including the use of other Access Nodes than a DSLAM,
      e.g. a PON Access Node).

   o  The ANCP must be flexible enough to accommodate the various
      technologies that can be used in an access network and in the
      Access Node.

   o  The ANCP MUST be an open protocol, either an existing protocol
      endorsed by an appropriate standard body (e.g.  IETF) or a new
      protocol which will be submitted for standardization to an
      appropriate standard body.  It must be possible for other
      organizations to define additional protocol information elements.

   o  The ANCP MUST be transaction-oriented, allowing to reliably share
      states between the NAS and the Access Node, and recover from loss
      of synchronization (e.g. node or link failure).  Transactions MUST
      be either fully completed, or rolled-back to the previous state.

   o  The ANCP MUST be able to recover from access network connectivity
      disruption and automatically resynchronize.  It MUST also be able
      to recover from message losses on the access network.

   o  The ANCP MUST allow fast-paced transactions, in the order of
      magnitude of tens of transactions per second between a given pair
      (Access Node, NAS).  The protocol MUST allow fast completion of a
      given operation, in the order of magnitude of tens of
      milliseconds.  The protocol MUST be scalable enough to allow a
      given NAS to control hundreds of Access Nodes.

   o  The ANCP MUST be simple and lightweight enough to allow an
      implementation on Access Nodes with limited control plane
      resources (e.g.  CPU and memory).

   o  The ANCP MUST ensure the authenticity of the message initiator and
      the integrity of the messages.  The main goal is to protect the
      systems (Access Nodes and NAS) against attacks.

   o  The ANCP SHOULD minimize sources of configuration mismatch, help
      automation of the overall operation of the systems involved
      (Access Nodes and NAS) and be easy to troubleshoot.

Internet-Draft               ANCP Framework                 October 2006


   o  The implementation of the ANCP in the NAS and Access Nodes MUST be
      manageable via an element management interface.  This MUST allow
      to retrieve statistics and alarms (e.g. via SNMP) about the
      operation of the ANCP, as well as initiate OAM operations and
      retrieve corresponding results.

4.2.  Protocol Design Requirements

   o  The ANCP SHOULD have a "boot" sequence allowing to inform the peer
      about control capabilities supported by the two peers (Access
      Node, NAS) and negotiate a common subset.  This sequence SHOULD be
      such that a system supporting the ANCP would automatically
      recognize when its peer doesn't support it at all.

   o  The ANCP SHOULD include a "keep-alive" mechanism to automatically
      detect loss of connectivity on the access network or failure of
      the peer node.

   o  The ANCP SHOULD provide a "shutdown" sequence allowing to inform
      the peer that the system is gracefully shutting down.

   o  The ANCP SHOULD include a "request/response" transaction-oriented
      model for the NAS to communicate control decisions or request
      information from the Access Node.  If the response is negative,
      then the state of the Access Node MUST be unchanged (roll-back).

   o  The ANCP SHOULD include a "report" model for the Access Node to
      spontaneously communicate to the NAS changes of states.

   o  The ANCP SHOULD support a graceful restart mechanism to enable it
      to be resilient to network failures between the AN and NAS.

   o  The ANCP MUST be mapped on top of the IP network layer.

   o  The ANCP MUST provide a means for the AN and the NAS to perform
      capability negotiation.

4.3.  ANCP transport requirements

   o  The Access Node Control Mechanism MUST be defined in a way that is
      independent of the underlying layer 2 transport technology.
      Specifically, the Access Node Control Mechanism MUST support
      transmission over an ATM as well as over an Ethernet aggregation
      network.

   o  If the layer 2 transport technology is based on ATM, then the
      encapsulation MUST be according to RFC2684 routed (IPoA).

Internet-Draft               ANCP Framework                 October 2006


   o  If the layer 2 transport technology is based on Ethernet, then the
      encapsulation MUST be according to RFC894 (IPoE).

   o  The transport protocol used for the Access Node Control Messages
      MUST be reliable and scalable.

   o  A loss of the Access Node Control Session MUST NOT affect user
      connectivity and element operation.

   o  If the Access Node Control Session is lost, it MUST NOT lead to
      undefined states on the network elements.

   o  For maintenance purpose the Access Node Control Session MUST be
      designed in a way that any malfunction of the session is
      automatically detected and reported from the Access Node or NAS to
      the Element Manager or Network Manager to support the network
      operator in troubleshooting the network.

4.4.  Access Node Requirements

   This section lists the requirements for an AN that supports the use
   cases defined in this document.

4.4.1.  General Architecture

   The Access Node Control Mechanism is defined by a dedicated relation
   between the Access Node (AN) and the NAS.  If one service provider
   has multiple physical NAS devices which represent one logical device
   (single edge architecture) one DSLAM can be connected to more than
   one NAS.  Therefore the physical DSLAM needs to be split in virtual
   DSLAMs each having its own Access Node Control reporting and/or
   enforcement function.

   o  An Access Node as physical device can be split in logical
      partitions.  Each partition MAY have its independent NAS.
      Therefore the Access Node MUST support at least 2 partitions.  The
      Access Node SHOULD support 8 partitions.

   o  One partition is grouped of several DSL ports.  Each physical DSL
      port of an Access Node MUST be assigned uniquely to one partition.

   o  Each AN partition MUST have a separate Access Node Control Session
      to a NAS and SHOULD be able to enforce access control on the
      controllers to only designated partitions being bound to one
      controller.

   o  The Access Node SHOULD be able to work with redundant controllers.

Internet-Draft               ANCP Framework                 October 2006


   o  The Access Node SHOULD support a non-disruptive method for re-
      synchronizing state with its Access Node Control peers.

4.4.2.  Control Channel Attributes

   Dependent on network topology the Access Node can be located in
   street cabinet or central office installation.  If an Access Node in
   street cabinet installation is connected to a NAS all user and Access
   Node Control data use the same physical link.  Usually, remote Access
   Nodes are aggregated by an aggregation network and connected to the
   NAS.  Certain attributes must be supported:

   o  The Control Channel SHOULD use the same facilities as the ones
      used for the data traffic.

   o  The Control Channel MUST be terminated at the Access Node.

   o  For security purposes, the Access Node Control Messages sent over
      the channel MUST NOT be sent towards the customer premises.

   o  The Access Node MUST NOT support the capability to configure
      sending Access Node Control Messages towards the customer
      premises.

   o  Control transactions SHOULD be processed in a timely fashion.

   o  Access Node Control Messages SHOULD be marked with a high priority
      (e.g.  VBR-rt or CBR for ATM cells, p-bit 6 or 7 for Ethernet
      packets) in order for the packets not to be dropped in case of
      congestion.

   o  If ATM interfaces are used VPI as well as VCI value MUST be
      configurable in the full range.

   o  If Ethernet interfaces are used, C-Tag as well as S-Tag MUST be
      configurable in the full range.

4.4.3.  Capability Negotiation

   o  The Access Node MUST support a means to perform capability
      negotiation with the NAS, as part of the Access Node Control
      Mechanism.

   o  In case the Access Node and NAS cannot agree on a common set of
      capabilities, the Access Node MUST report this failure to network
      management.

Internet-Draft               ANCP Framework                 October 2006


4.4.4.  Adjacency

   o  The Access Node MUST support an adjacency protocol used to
      synchronize states across the link, discover the identity of the
      entity at the other end of a link, and detect when it changes.

   o  The Access Node SHOULD report adjacency establishment or loss of
      adjacency with the controller to network management.

4.4.5.  Identification

   o  To identify the Access Node and Access Port within a control
      domain a unique identifier is required.  This identifier MUST be
      in line with the addressing scheme principles specified in section
      3.9.3 of TR-101.

   o  To allow for correlation in the NAS, the AN MUST use the same ACI
      format for identifying the AN and access port in Access Node
      Control Messages, PPPoE and DHCP messages.

4.4.6.  Message Handling

   o  The Access Node SHOULD dampen notifications related to line
      attributes or line state.

   o  The Access Node SHOULD be able to handle sending/receiving a large
      burst of messages efficiently (e.g. using mechanisms like "message
      bundling").

4.4.7.  Parameter Control

   Naturally the Access Node Control Mechanism is not designed to
   replace an Element Manager managing the Access Node.  There are
   parameters primarily layer 1 in the Access Node such as the DSL noise
   margin and DSL Power Spectral Densities (PSD) which are not allowed
   to be configured by ANCP or any other control session except the
   Element Manager.  This has to be ensured and protected by the Access
   Node.  It needs to be configured in the Access Node which parameters
   are allowed (resp. not allowed) to be modified using the Access Node
   Control Mechanism, how parameters should be modified, stored, or
   overwritten It needs to be defined the default parameter set the
   Access Node will come up after recovery.

   o  It MUST be possible to configure which parameters can be modified.

4.5.  Network Access Server Requirements

   This section lists the requirements for a NAS that supports the use
   cases defined in this document.

4.5.1.  General Architecture

   o  The NAS MUST only communicate to authorized Access Node Control
      peers.

   o  The NAS MUST support the capability to simultaneously run ANCP
      with multiple ANs in a network.

   o  The NAS MUST support generating an alarm to a management station
      on loss of an Access Node Control Session.

   o  The NAS SHOULD support a non-disruptive method for re-
      synchronizing state with its Access Node Control peers.

   o  The NAS MUST be able to establish an Access Node Control Session
      to a particular partition on an AN and control the access loops
      belonging to such a partition.

   o  The NAS MUST support shaping traffic directed towards a particular
      local-loop to not exceed the DSL sync rate learnt from the AN via
      the Access Node Control Mechanism.

   o  The NAS SHOULD support a reduction or disabling of such shaping
      limit, derived from Policy/Radius per-subscriber authorization
      data.

   o  The NAS MUST support reporting of access loop attributes learned
      via the Access Node Control Mechanism to a Radius server using
      RADIUS VSAs.

   o  The NAS MUST correlate Access Node Control information with the
      RADIUS authorization process and related subscriber data.

   o  The NAS SHOULD support shaping traffic directed towards a
      particular access loop to include layer-1 and layer-2
      encapsulation overhead information received for a specific access
      loop from the AN via the Access Node Control Mechanism.

   o  The NAS SHOULD support dynamically configuring and re-configuring
      discrete service parameters for access loops that are controlled
      by the NAS.  The configurable service parameters for access loops
      could be driven by local configuration on the NAS or by a radius/
      policy server.

   o  The NAS SHOULD support triggering an AN via the Access Node
      Control Mechanism to execute local OAM procedures on an access
      loop that is controlled by the NAS.  If the NAS supports this
      capability, then the following applies:

      *  The NAS MUST identify the access loop on which OAM procedures
         need to be executed by specifying an ACI in the request message
         to the AN;

      *  The NAS SHOULD support processing and reporting of the remote
         OAM results learned via the Access Node Control Mechanism.

      *  As part of the parameters conveyed within the OAM message to
         the AN, the NAS SHOULD send the list of test parameters
         pertinent to the OAM procedure.  The AN will then execute the
         OAM procedure on the specified access loop according to the
         specified parameters.  In case no test parameters are conveyed,
         the AN and NAS MUST use default and/or appropriately computed
         values.

      *  After issuing an OAM request, the NAS will consider the request
         to have failed if no response is received after a certain
         period of time.  The timeout value SHOULD be either the one
         sent within the OAM message to the AN, or the computed timeout
         value when no parameter was sent.

      The exact set of test parameters mentioned above depends on the
      particular OAM procedure executed on the access loop.  An example
      of a set of test parameters is the number of loopbacks to be
      performed on the access loop and the timeout value for the overall
      test.  In this case, and assuming an ATM based access loop, the
      default value for the timout parameter would be equal to the
      number of F5 loopbacks to be performed, multiplied by the F5
      loopback timeout (i.e. 5 seconds per the ITU-T I.610 standard).

   o  The NAS MUST treat PPP or DHCP session state independently from
      any Access Node Control Session state.  The NAS MUST NOT bring
      down the PPP or DHCP sessions just because the Access Node Control
      Session goes down.

   o  The NAS SHOULD internally treat Access Node Control traffic in a
      timely and scalable fashion.

   o  The NAS SHOULD protect its resources from misbehaved Access Node
      Control peers by providing a mechanism to dampen information
      related to an access node partition.

   o  The NAS SHOULD support protection of Access Node Control
      communication to an access node in case of line card failure.

4.5.2.  Control Channel Attributes

   o  The NAS MUST mark Access Node Control Messages as high priority
      (e.g. appropriately set DSCP, Ethernet priority bits or ATM CLP
      bit) such that the aggregation network between the NAS and the AN
      can prioritize the Access Node Control Messages over user traffic
      in case of congestion.

4.5.3.  Capability Negotiation

   o  The NAS MUST support a means to perform capability negotiation
      with the AN, as part of the Access Node Control Mechanism.

   o  The NAS MUST only commence Access Node Control information
      exchange and state synchronization with the AN when there is a
      non-empty common set of capabilities with that AN.

   o  In case the NAS and AN cannot agree on a common set of
      capabilities, the NAS MUST report this to network management.

4.5.4.  Identification

   o  The NAS MUST support correlating Access Node Control Messages
      pertaining to a given access loop with subscriber session(s) over
      that access loop.  This correlation MUST be achieved by either:

      *  Matching an ACI inserted by the AN in Access Node Control
         Messages with corresponding ACI value received in subscriber
         signaling (e.g.  PPPoE and DHCP) messages as inserted by the
         AN.  The format of ACI is defined in [TR-101];

      *  Matching an ACI inserted by the AN in Access Node Control
         Messages with an ACI value locally configured for a static
         subscriber on the NAS.

4.5.5.  Message Handling

   o  The NAS MUST support learning of access loop attributes, from its
      peer access node partitions via the Access Node Control Mechanism.

4.5.6.  Wholesale Model

   o  In case of wholesale access, network provider's The NAS SHOULD
      support reporting of access loop attributes learned from AN via
      the Access Node Control Mechanism (or values derived from such

      attributes), to a retail provider's network gateway owning the
      corresponding subscriber(s).

   o  The NAS when acting as a LAC MUST communicate generic access line
      related information to the LNS in a timely fashion.

   o  The NAS when acting as a LAC MAY asynchronously notify the LNS of
      updates to generic access line related information.

6.  Management related requirements

   o  The configuration of the IP layer (e.g.  IP address assignment)
      for the Control Channel MUST be possible via SNMP on both the AN
      and the NAS.

   o  When the operational status of the Control Channel is changed
      (up>down, down>up) a linkdown/linkup trap SHOULD be sent towards
      the EMS.  This requirement applies to both the AN and the NAS.

   o  The Access Node MUST provide the possibility using SNMP to
      associate individual DSL lines with specific Access Node Control
      Sessions.

   o  The Access Node MUST notify the EMS of Access Node Control
      configuration changes in a timely manner.

   o  The Access Node MUST provide a mechanism that allows the
      concurrent access on the same resource from several managers (EMS
      via SNMP, NAS via ANCP).  Only one manager may perform a change at
      a certain time.
