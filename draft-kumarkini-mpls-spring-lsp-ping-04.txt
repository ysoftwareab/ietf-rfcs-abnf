                             MPLS Dataplane
                draft-kumarkini-mpls-spring-lsp-ping-04

Abstract

   Segment Routing architecture leverages the source routing and
   tunneling paradigms and can be directly applied to MPLS data plane.
   A node steers a packet through a controlled set of instructions
   called segments, by prepending the packet with a Segment Routing
   header.

   The segment assignment and forwarding semantic nature of Segment
   Routing raises additional consideration for connectivity verification
   and fault isolation in LSP with Segment Routing architecture.  This
   document illustrates the problem and describe a mechanism to perform
   LSP Ping and Traceroute on Segment Routing network over MPLS data
   plane.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing] introduces and explains Segment
   Routing architecture that leverages the source routing and tunneling
   paradigms.  A node steers a packet through a controlled set of
   instructions called segments, by prepending the packet with Segment
   Routing header.  A detailed definition about Segment Routing
   architecture is available in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing] and
   different use-cases are discussed in
   [I-D.filsfils-spring-segment-routing-use-cases]

   The Segment Routing architecture can be directly applied to MPLS data
   plane in a way that, the Segment identifier (Segment ID) will be of
   20-bits size and Segment Routing header is the label stack.

   Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) has defined in [RFC4379] a
   simple and efficient mechanism to detect data plane failures in Label
   Switched Paths (LSP) by specifying information to be carried in an
   MPLS "echo request" and "echo reply" for the purposes of fault
   detection and isolation, and mechanisms for reliably sending the echo
   reply.  The functionality is modeled after the ping/traceroute
   paradigm (ICMP echo request [RFC0792]) and is typically referred to
   as LSP ping and LSP traceroute.

   Unlike LDP or RSVP which are the other well-known MPLS control plane
   protocols, segment assignment in Segment Routing architecture is not
   hop-by-hop basis.

   This nature of Segment Routing raises additional consideration for
   fault detection and isolation in Segment Routing network.  This
   document illustrates the problem and describe a mechanism to perform
   LSP Ping and Traceroute on Segment Routing network over MPLS data
   plane.

2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminologies defined in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing], [RFC4379], and so the readers are
   expected to be familiar with the same.

4.  Challenges with Existing mechanism

   This document defines sub-TLVs for the Target FEC Stack TLV and
   explains how they can be used to tackle below challenges.

4.1.  Path validation in Segment Routing networks

   [RFC4379] defines the OAM machinery that helps with fault detection
   and isolation in MPLS dataplane path with the use of various Target
   FEC Stack Sub-TLV that are carried in MPLS Echo Request packets and
   used by the responder for FEC validation.  While it is obvious that
   new Sub-TLVs need to be assigned, the unique nature of Segment
   Routing architecture raises a need for additional machinery for path
   validation.  This section discuss the challenges as below:


                      L1
                  +--------+
                  |   L2   |
                  R3-------R6
                 /           \
                /             \
        R1----R2               R7----R8
                \             /
                 \           /
                  R4-------R5

          Figure 1: Segment Routing network

 The Node segment IDs for R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7 and R8 are 5001, 5002, 5003, 5004, 5005, 5006, 5007, 5008 respectively.

    9136 --> Adjacency Segment ID from R3 to R6 over link L1.
    9236 --> Adjacency Segment ID from R3 to R6 over link L2.
    9124 --> Adjacency segment ID from R2 to R4.
    9123 --> Adjacency Segment ID from R2 to R3.


   The forwarding semantic of Adjacency Segment ID is to pop the segment
   ID and send the packet to a specific neighbor over a specific link.
   A malfunctioning node may forward packets using Adjacency Segment ID
   to incorrect neighbor or over incorrect link.  Exposed segment ID
   (after incorrectly forwarded Adjacency Segment ID) might still allow
   such packet to reach the intended destination, although the intended
   strict traversal has been broken.

   Assume in above topology, R1 sends traffic with segment stack as
   {9124, 5008} so that the path taken will be R1-R2-R4-R5-R7-R8.  If
   the Adjacency Segment ID 9124 is misprogrammed in R2 to send the

   packet to R1 or R3, it will still be delivered to R8 but is not via
   the expected path.

   MPLS traceroute may help with detecting such deviation in above
   mentioned scenario.  However, in a different example, it may not be
   helpful.  For example if R3, due to misprogramming, forwards packet
   with Adjacency Segment ID 9236 via link L1 while it is expected to be
   forwarded over Link L2.

4.2.  Service Label

   A Segment ID can represent a service based instruction.  An Segment
   Routing header can have label stack entries where the label
   represents a service to be applied along the path.  Since these
   labels are part of the label stack, they can influence the path taken
   by a packet and consequently have implications on MPLS OAM.  In
   section 6.5 of this document, it is described how the procedures of
   [RFC4379] can be applied to in the absence of service-labels in
   Section 6.5.  Additional considerations for service labels are
   included in Section 7 and requires further discussion.

5.  Segment ID sub-TLV

   The format of the following Segment ID sub-TLVs follows the
   philosophy of Target FEC Stack TLV carrying FECs corresponding to
   each label in the label stack.  When operated with the procedures
   defined in [RFC4379], this allows LSP ping/traceroute operations to
   function when Target FEC Stack TLV contains more FECs than received
   label stack at responder nodes.

   Three new sub-TLVs are defined for TLVs type 1, 16 and 21.

           sub-Type    Value Field
           --------  ---------------
           TBD1      IPv4 Prefix Node Segment ID
           TBD2      IPv6 Prefix Node Segment ID

   Service Segments and FRR will be considered in future version.

   Local Interface ID

      An identifier that is assigned by local LSR for a link on which
      Adjacency Segment ID is bound.  This field is set to local link
      address (IPv4 or IPv6).  Incase of unnumbered, 32 bit link
      identifier defined in [RFC4203], [RFC5307] is used.  If the
      Adjacency Segment ID represents parallel adjacencies
      (Section 3.5.1 of [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing]) this field
      MUST be set to zero.

   Remote Interface ID

      An identifier that is assigned by remote LSR for a link on which
      Adjacency Segment ID is bound.  This field is set to remote
      (downstream neighbor) link address (IPv4 or IPv6).  In case of
      unnumbered, 32 bit link identifier defined in [RFC4203], [RFC5307]
      is used.  If the Adjacency Segment ID represents parallel
      adjacencies (Section 3.5.1 of [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing])
      this field MUST be set to zero.

   Advertising Node Identifier

      Specifies the advertising node identifier.  When Protocol is set
      to 1, then the 32 rightmost bits represent OSPF Router ID and if
      protocol is set to 2, this field carries 48 bit ISIS System ID.

   Receiving Node Identifier

      Specifies the downstream node identifier.  When Protocol is set to
      1, then the 32 rightmost bits represent OSPF Router ID and if
      protocol is set to 2, this field carries 48 bit ISIS System ID.

6.  Extension to Downstream Mapping TLV

   In an echo reply, the Downstream Mapping TLV [RFC4379] is used to
   report for each interface over which a FEC could be forwarded.  For a
   FEC, there are multiple protocols that may be used to distribute
   label mapping.  The "Protocol" field of the Downstream Mapping TLV is
   used to return the protocol that is used to distribute a specific a
   label.  The following protocols are defined in section 3.2 of
   [RFC4379]:

7.  Procedures

   This section describes aspects of LSP Ping and traceroute operations
   that require further considerations beyond [RFC4379].

7.1.  FECs in Target FEC Stack TLV

   When LSP echo request packets are generated by an initiator, FECs
   carried in Target FEC Stack TLV may need to have deviating contents.
   This document outlines expected Target FEC Stack TLV construction
   mechanics by initiator for known scenarios.

         Initiator MUST include FEC(s) corresponding to the destination
         segment.

         Initiator MAY include FECs corresponding to some or all of
         segments imposed in the label stack by the initiator to
         communicate the segments traversed.

      Traceroute

         Initiator MUST initially include FECs corresponding to all of
         segments imposed in the label stack.

         When a received echo reply contains FEC Stack Change TLV with
         one or more of original segment(s) being popped, initiator MAY
         remove corresponding FEC(s) from Target FEC Stack TLV in the
         next (TTL+1) traceroute request.

         When a received echo reply does not contain FEC Stack Change
         TLV, initiator MUST NOT attempt to remove FEC(s) from Target
         FEC Stack TLV in the next (TTL+1) traceroute request.  Note
         that Downstream Label field of DSMAP/DDMAP contains hints on
         how initiator may be able to update the contents of next Target
         FEC Stack TLV.  However, such hints are ambiguous without full
         understanding of PHP capabilities.

7.2.  FEC Stack Change sub-TLV

   Section 3.3.1.3 of [RFC6424] defines a new sub-TLV that a router must
   include when the FEC stack changes.

   The network node which advertised the Node Segment ID is responsible
   for generating FEC Stack Change sub-TLV of &pop& operation for Node
   Segment ID, regardless of if PHP is enabled or not.

   The network node that is immediate downstream of the node which
   advertised the Adjacency Segment ID is responsible for generating FEC
   Stack Change sub-TLV of &pop& operation for Adjacency Segment ID.

7.3.  Segment ID POP Operation

   The forwarding semantic of Node Segment ID with PHP flag is
   equivalent to usage of implicit Null in MPLS protocols.  Adjacency
   Segment ID is also similar in a sense that it can be thought as next
   hop destined locally allocated segment that has PHP enabled.
   Procedures described in Section 4.4 of [RFC4379] relies on Stack-D
   and Stack-R explicitly having Implicit Null value.  It may simplify
   implementations to reuse Implicit Null for Node Segment ID PHP and
   Adjacency Segment ID cases.  However, it is technically incorrect for
   Implicit Null value to externally appear.  Therefore, implicit Null
   MUST NOT be placed in Stack-D and Interface and Label Stack TLV for
   Node Segment ID PHP and Adjacency Segment ID cases.

7.4.  Segment ID Check

      If the Label-stack-depth is 0 and Target FEC Stack Sub-TLV at FEC-
      stack-depth is TBD1 (IPv4 Prefix Node Segment ID), the responder
      should set Best return code to 10 if any below conditions fail: /*
      The responder LSR is to check if it is the egress of the IPv4
      Prefix Node Segment ID described in the Target FEC Stack Sub-TLV,
      and if the FEC was advertised with the PHP bit set.*/

      *  Validate that Node Segment ID is advertised for IPv4 Prefix.

      *  Validate that Node Segment ID is advertisement of PHP bit.

      If the Label-stack-depth is more than 0 and Target FEC Stack Sub-
      TLV at FEC-stack-depth is TBD1 (IPv4 Prefix Node Segment ID), the
      responder is to set Best return code to 10 if any below conditions
      fail:

      *  Validate that Node Segment ID is advertised for IPv4 Prefix.

      If the Label-stack-depth is 0 and Target FEC Sub-TLV at FEC-stack-
      depth is TBD2 (IPv6 Prefix Node Segment ID), set Best return code
      to 10 if any below conditions fail: /* The LSR needs to check if
      its being a tail-end for the LSP and have the prefix advertised
      with PHP bit set*/

      *  Validate that Node Segment ID is advertised for IPv6 Prefix.

      *  Validate that Node Segment ID is advertised of PHP bit.

      If the Label-stack-depth is 0 and Target FEC Sub-TLV at FEC-stack-
      depth is TBD2 (IPv6 Prefix Node Segment ID), set Best return code
      to 10 if any below conditions fail:

      *  Validate that Node Segment ID is advertised for IPv6 Prefix.

      If the Label-stack-depth is 0 and Target FEC sub-TLV at FEC-stack-
      depth is TBD3 (Adjacency Segment ID), set Best return code to
      (error code TBD) if any below conditions fail:

         When the Adj.Type is 1 (Parallel Adjacency):

         +  Validate that Receiving Node Identifier is local IGP
            identifier.

         +  Validate that Adjacency Segment ID is advertised by
            Advertising Node Identifier of Protocol in local IGP
            database.

         When the Adj.Type is 4 or 6:

         +  Validate that Remote Interface ID matches the local
            identifier of the interface (Interface-I) on which the
            packet was received.

         +  Validate that Receiving Node Identifier is local IGP
            identifier.

         +  Validate that IGP Adjacency Segment ID is advertised by
            Advertising Node Identifier of Protocol in local IGP
            database.

7.5.  TTL Consideration for traceroute

   LSP Traceroute operation can properly traverse every hop of Segment
   Routing network in Uniform Model described in [RFC3443].  If one or
   more LSRs employ Short Pipe Model described in [RFC3443], then LSP
   Traceroute may not be able to properly traverse every hop of Segment
   Routing network due to absence of TTL copy operation when outer label
   is popped.  In such scenario, following TTL manipulation technique
   MAY be used.

   When tracing a LSP according to the procedures in [RFC4379] the TTL
   is incremented by one in order to trace the path sequentially along
   the LSP.  However when a source routed LSP has to be traced there are
   as many TTLs as there are labels in the stack.  The LSR that
   initiates the traceroute SHOULD start by setting the TTL to 1 for the
   tunnel in the LSP's label stack it wants to start the tracing from,
   the TTL of all outer labels in the stack to the max value, and the
   TTL of all the inner labels in the stack to zero.  Thus a typical
   start to the traceroute would have a TTL of 1 for the outermost label
   and all the inner labels would have TTL 0.  If the FEC Stack TLV is
   included it should contain only those for the inner stacked tunnels.
   The lack of an echo response or the Return Code/Subcode should be
   used to diagnose the tunnel as described in [RFC4379].  When the
   tracing of a tunnel in the stack is complete, then the next tunnel in
   the stack should be traced.  The end of a tunnel can be detected from
   the "Return Code" when it indicates that the responding LSR is an
   egress for the stack at depth 1.  Thus the traceroute procedures in
   [RFC4379] can be recursively applied to traceroute a source routed
   LSP.

8.  Issues with non-forwarding labels

   Source stacking can be optionally used to apply services on the
   packet at a LSR along the path, where a label in the stack is used to
   trigger service application.  A data plane failure detection and
   isolation mechanism should provide its functionality without applying
   these services.  This is mandatory for services that are stateful,
   though for stateless services [RFC4379] could be used as-is.  It MAY
   also provide a mechanism to detect and isolate faults within the
   service function itself.

   To prevent services from being applied to an "echo request" packet,
   the TTL of service labels MUST be 0.  However TTL processing rules of
   a service label must be the same as any MPLS label.  Due to this a
   TTL of 0 in the service label would prevent the packet from being
   forwarded beyond the LSR that provides the service.  To avoid this
   problem, the originator of the "echo request" MUST NOT include the
   service label in the label stack of an echo request above the tunnel

   label of the tunnel that is being currently traced.  In other words
   the ingress must remove all service-labels above the label of the
   tunnel being currently traced, but retain service labels below it
   when sending the echo request.  Note that load balancing may affect
   the path when the service labels are removed, resulting in a newer
   path being traversed.  However this new path is potentially different
   only up to the LSR that provides the service.  Since this portion of
   the path was traced when the tunnels above this tunnel in the stack
   were traced and followed the exact path as the source routed LSP,
   this should not be a major concern.  Sometimes the newer path may
   have a problem that was not in the original path resulting in a false
   positive.  In such a case the original path can be traversed by
   changing the label stack to reach the intermediate LSR with labels
   that route along each hop explicitly.

9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  New Target FEC Stack Sub-TLVs

   IANA is requested to assign 3 new Sub-TLVs from "Sub-TLVs for TLV
   Types 1, 16 and 21" sub-registry.

     Sub-Type          Sub-TLV Name             Reference
   ----------        -----------------         ------------
      TBD1        IPv4 Prefix Node Segment ID  Section 4.1 (this document)
      TBD2        IPv6 Prefix Node Segment ID  Section 4.2 (this document)
      TBD3        Adjacency Segment ID         Section 4.3 (this document)

10.  Security Considerations

   This document defines additional Sub-TLVs and follows the mechanism
   defined in [RFC4379].  So all the security consideration defined in
   [RFC4379] will be applicable for this document and in addition it
   does not impose any security challenges to be considered.
