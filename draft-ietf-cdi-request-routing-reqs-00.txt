Abstract

   Request-routing systems (RRS) are components of Content Distribution
   Networks (CDNs) that direct client requests to an available copy of
   content based on one or more metrics.  To enable the interconnection of
   CDNs [MODEL][ARCH], it is necessary for their request-routing systems to
   interconnect and exchange information such that client requests can be
   routed between CDNs.  This is called request-routing internetworking.
   This document specifies the requirements for request-routing
   internetworking.

1. Introduction

   Request-routing systems (RRS) are components of Content Distribution
   Networks (CDNs) that direct client requests to an available copy of
   content based on one or more metrics.  To enable the interconnection
   of CDNs [MODEL][ARCH], it is necessary for their request-routing
   systems to interconnect and exchange information such that client
   requests can be routed between CDNs.  This is called request-routing
   internetworking.  This document specifies the requirements for
   request-routing internetworking.



1.1 Document Organization

   This document is organized as follows.  Section 1 presents an
   introduction to request-routing systems.  Section 2 presents the
   details of request-routing system components and protocols.  Section
   3 presents detailed requirements for each component, sub-component or
   protocol from sections 1 and 2.


1.2 Overview of Request-Routing Systems

   Request-routing systems (RRS) are components of content networks (CN)
   that direct client requests to surrogates that can "best" service the
   request [KNOWN_MECH].  Request-routing decisions are based on a set
   of metrics that may include for example network proximity and server
   load.  The basic functionality of a request-routing system can be
   summarized by the following:

     1. It directs clients to surrogates that are able to service their
     requests.

     2. It directs clients to surrogates that (per a set of metrics) are
     able to provide the "best" service.

   A given client request may not necessarily cause a full redirection
   but may use cached information to fulfull the request (e.g. DNS-based
   request- routing systems).  Nonetheless, we use the term "client
   request" within this document to refer (mostly) to a request not
   fulfilled from an intermediate cache.

   For the sake of clarity, we now reiterate several important
   assumptions from [ARCH] [MODEL]:

     1. Each content network is a "black box" to other networks to which
     it is interconnected.  We use the term "neighbor CN" to refer to a
     directly interconnected content network.

     2. Content is served by surrogates that act on behalf of an origin
     server that holds the "master" or "authoritative" copy of content.
     Surrogates are part of a distribution system.

     3. A request-routing system is responsible for directing/servicing
     requests for one or more distribution systems.

     4. Each distribution system may have its own internal (or intra-CN)
     request-routing system that is not exposed to other interconnected
     networks.

     5. Request-routing systems interconnect through content
     internetworking gateways (CIG) that implement standards based
     interconnection protocols.  A CN's CIG is the only "visible"
     element to other interconnected CNs.


1.3 Generic Request-Routing System Architecture

   This section presents a generic architecture of a request-routing
   system to assist in understanding request-routing systems as well as
   the requirements for their interconnection.  In Figure 1, a
   conceptual view of a request-routing system is presented; it consists
   of the following components: Content Topology Exchange, Content
   Topology Database and Route Computation.  A brief summary of these
   components is provided below:

     2. Content Topology Database: The topology database includes
     detailed advertisement information received from CN neighbors and
     the associated metrics that are included.

     3. Advertisement Exchange: This functional block is responsible for
     implementing the Request-Routing Information Exchange protocol.

     4. Request-Routing Information Exchange Protocol: The actual
     protocol used to exchange sets of content advertisements and area
     advertisements [MODEL].


1.4 Interconnecting Request-Routing Systems

   Within a single CN, a request-routing system is used to direct client
   requests to surrogates that are part of its own distribution system.

   However, when request-routing systems are interconnected, a request-
   router has the ability to redirect client requests to neighbor CNs.
   That is, when neighbor CN can "better" serve a set of clients, it may
   be desirable to direct requests to that neighbor CN.  In order to
   determine which CN may best serve a client request, one or more
   protocols may be required to exchange various types of information
   and associated metrics.

   This document describes the components of request-routing systems and
   requirements for interconnecting them.


2. Overview of Request-Routing System Components and Protocols

   This section provides a detailed description of the basic components
   of a request-routing system.  Section 3 provides a description of the
   specific requirements for each component.


2.1 Request-Routing System Types

   The methods in which a client request is directed may be different
   depending on the architecture of the request-routing system.
   Currently, there are two well-known types of request-routing systems
   [KNOWN_MECH]. These two types are described below:

     1. DNS-based Request-Routing Systems:  The Domain Name System (DNS)
     is used for the direction of client requests.  In this approach,
     one or more domain names are assigned to the request-routing
     system; these names are then used as part of a URI reference to
     direct client requests [DNSMAP].  The limitations of DNS-based
     systems are described [KNOWN_MECH] and in section 2.1.1.

     2. "In-Line" Request-Routing Systems:  These request-routing
     systems are "in-line" to client requests.  Examples of in-line
     request-routing systems are those that may be implemented within a
     proxy or a layer-7 router.  In-line request-routing systems have
     full visibility into content requests (e.g. full URL) as well as
     visibility of the client's IP address [note: this isn't always true
     if transparent proxies are in place].

   The distinction between these request-routing system types is
   important because of the differences in:

     - The view of the content identifier (partial vs. whole).

     - The view of the client (e.g. client's IP vs. client's local DNS).

     - The implementation requirements of the two types (e.g. DNS
     caching).


2.1.1 DNS-Based Request-Routing Systems




Cain, et. al.             Expires May 2002                      ^L[Page 4]





Internet-Draft                                             February 2002


   In DNS-based request-routing systems [ARCH] [DNSMAP], only aggregate
   sets of content may be "directed" because a domain name (e.g.
   images.blah.com) can only (reasonably) represent a larger set of
   content.  A DNS-based request-routing system works well in scenarios
   where many surrogates share large sets of content.

   DNS-based request-routing systems suffer from the following
   limitations:
     - The request-routing system knows only the domain name of the
     requested content.  This precludes the RRS from knowing the full
     content path (e.g. URI) and the content type (e.g. HTTP, RTSP).

     - The request-routing system knows the client's local DNS server,
     not the client itself.

     - The request-routing system responses may be cached in DNS
     servers.  The result is that a client request may not be
     individually directed by the request-routing system.


2.1.1.1 DNS Example

   Content network CN-A is authoritative for http://images.blah.com (or
   CNAMEs are used to ultimately force a resolution of this name to CN
   A).  Assume that DNS-based request-router R is part of CN-A and is
   also a CIG for CN-A.  When R receives a client DNS request for
   images.blah.com, it makes a request-routing decision.  This decision
   may be to direct the request to its own surrogates or to direct the
   request to another CN.  This decision is based on the routing
   computation by CIG-A that in turn is based on "area" and/or "content"
   advertisements [MODEL] received from neighbors.  For example, CIG-A
   can make a request-routing decision based on the following:

     1. Information contained in area advertisements that have been
     received from interconnected CNs.  An example may be an IP prefix
     advertised with an associated metric.

     2. The ability of interconnected CNs to support the (content) type
     of the request.

     3. Information contained in content advertisements that may
     include: content metrics, availability of content, etc.  With DNS-
     based request-routing systems, content specific information is only
     relevant to the DNS name (e.g.  in a URI).

     4. Local request-routing policy.

   If the choice is made to direct the request to another CN, the
   appropriate CNAME is used to direct the client's DNS to the chosen
   neighbor CN.  The process then continues.


2.1.2 "In-Line" Request-Routing Systems




Cain, et. al.             Expires May 2002                      ^L[Page 5]





Internet-Draft                                             February 2002


   A Layer-7 router or Proxy situated close to a client may be used as
   an "in-line" request-routing system.  Such a RRS is capable of
   directing client requests based on individual full content requests.
   This is possible because layer-7 information (e.g. HTTP headers) is
   exposed to the layer-7 router or proxy.  In this type of RRS, a
   surrogate can be chosen based on, for example, a full URL.  Another
   example of in-line request-routing is when an origin server (or
   reverse proxy) performs a layer-7 redirection by "URL-rewriting".

   There are three major differences between an "in-line" request-
   routing system and a DNS-based request-routing system.  The first is
   that the full content request is exposed (e.g. a full URL).  The
   second is that the content type of the request is exposed (again from
   the full URL).  The third is that all client requests can be received
   by the request-routing system; this is in contrast to DNS-based
   systems where caching may prevent this.


2.1.2.1 "In-Line" Example

   Assume client X is configured to forward its requests to layer-7
   request-router R.  Furthermore assume that request-router R is a CIG
   for content network CN-A.  When a request from client X is received,
   request-router R makes a request-routing decision based on its
   content topology database constructed from information communicated
   from other neighbor CNs.  If request-router R can service the request
   within its own distribution system then the request is sent to a
   surrogate that is part of CN-A.  If request router R decides to
   direct the client to another neighbor CN, a redirect is sent to the
   client to direct the cilent to another layer-7 request-router in a
   neighboring CN.  In summary, when "in-line" request routing is used,
   the redirection decision is based on the following:

     1. Information contained in area advertisements that have been
     received from neighbor CNs.  An example may be an IP prefix
     advertised with an associated metric.

     2. The ability of neighbor CNs to support the content type of the
     request.  An example may be a set of content types supported.

     3. Information contained in content advertisements from neighbor
     CNs that may include: content metrics, availability of content,
     etc.  For "in-line" request-routing systems this may include full
     URLs or URL sets.

     4. Local request-routing policy.


2.2 Request-Routing Interconnection Model

   Request-routing systems (RRS) present a "black-box" view of their
   associated distribution systems.  Since in such an environment no CN
   possesses a global view of all other CNs, the request-routing system
   must also rely on a peer-to-peer model in which each request-routing



Cain, et. al.             Expires May 2002                      ^L[Page 6]





Internet-Draft                                             February 2002


   system is only aware of its direct neighbor.  [Note: A direct
   neighbor of the request-routing systems does not have to be a direct
   neighbor at Layer-3].

   There are two methods for redirecting a request between two
   interconnected request-routing systems.  The first method is an
   iterative method where a RRS directs the request to the next-best
   (neighbor) RRS.  This continues until a surrogate is finally
   selected.  The second method is recursive where a RRS directs a
   request to the next-best RRS but expects an answer to return to the
   client.  These two methods are analogous to recursive vs. iterative
   DNS lookups.

   An example of how requests can be directed between CNs is through the
   use of DNS CNAMEs.  When DNS-based request-routing systems are
   interconnected and redirecting requests using CNAMEs, a clients DNS
   resolution is redirected using a DNS CNAME record to another DNS-
   based request-routing system until a surrogate is found that is
   appropriate (according to a set of metrics) to serve the content.
   The drawbacks of CNAME based request-routing are discussed in [KNOWN
   MECH].



2.3 CN Capabilities

   Request-routing systems are associated with one or more distribution
   systems.  When a request-routing system directs a client request it
   must ensure that:

     1. The client request type can be serviced by the distribution
     system (e.g. HTTP vs. RTSP).

     2. The distribution system to which a client is directed has the
     capacity to service the request.

   In order to ensure that an interconnected (neighbor) CN can service a
   request, a request-routing system is required to have the following
   information about neighbor CNs:

     1. Request-routing system types.

     2. Content types that can be served by the CN.

     3. Sets of metrics that are used for direction.

   This information maybe obtained manually (off-line) or through the
   use of dynamic (on-line) information exchange protocols.


2.4 Request-Routing Information Exchange

   Interconnected request-routing systems need to exchange information
   in order to make request-routing decisions.  The two request-routing



Cain, et. al.             Expires May 2002                      ^L[Page 7]





Internet-Draft                                             February 2002


   system types presented in section 1.2 have slightly different
   requirements with respect to the types of information exchanged.  In
   summary, interconnected request-routing systems need to exchange two
   basic types of information:

     1. Area Advertisements: Advertisements from a CN's request-routing
     system about aspects of topology, geography and performance of a
     CN.

     2. Content Advertisements: Advertisements from a CN's request-
     routing system about the availability of one or more collections of
     content on CN.  This may include for example: urls, content types,
     distribution model, authoritative request-routing system, etc.

   Request-routing information exchange follows the model of layer-3
   routing protocols.  That is, advertisements are sent to neighbor CNs
   and each request-routing system makes its own decisions.  The design
   of an information exchange protocol must take the following into
   consideration:

     - Information exchange may occur over highly unreliable networks.

     - Information exchange protocols may be required to exchange large
     sets of advertisement information.

     - Information exchange may occur over insecure networks.

     - Arbitrary meshed topologies may exist for information exchange
     protocols.


2.5 Request-Routing Decision

   Request-routing systems make decisions based on one or more
   advertisement types and their associated metrics.  Both content
   advertisements and area advertisements may be used to construct a
   request-routing content topology database.  This table is used to
   determine how requests should be directed.  The request-routing
   decision process is complex for the following reasons:

     - Content delivery networks are overlay networks which inherently
     makes decision processes more complex.

     - There are many possible metrics; if multiple metrics are
     exchanged, loop prevention may be difficult.

     - Request-routing systems may have specific policies with respect
     to direction.

     - Request-routing decisions are independent; therefore request-
     routing loops must be prevented.


2.6 Request-Routing Protocol Design



Cain, et. al.             Expires May 2002                      ^L[Page 8]





Internet-Draft                                             February 2002


   In order to interconnect request-routing systems, one or more
   protocols are required to exchange request-routing information.
   These protocols are designed to operate in an inter-domain context
   and therefore have the following considerations:

     - Protocol sessions will need to be debugged across CN boundaries.

     - Large sets of information may be exchanged between CNs.

     - Policy based request-routing is needed in many scenarios.

     - Protocol designs should be "Internet" scalable.


3. Request-Routing System and Protocol Requirements



3.1 General Requirements

   In the following section we describe the general requirements for
   protocols to be used in the interconnection of request-routing
   systems.

     - Request-routing protocols MUST use an administrative identity to
     identify themselves in protocol exchanges.

     - Request-routing protocols SHOULD support arbitrary direction
     topologies; this means "peer-to-peer" design.

     - Request-routing protocols MUST treat other content networks as
     "black boxes"; that is, a given CN A does not normally posses
     direct visibility into another neighbor CN B.

     - Request-routing protocols MUST support methods to determine the
     authoritative request-routing system for content.

     - Request-routing protocols SHOULD be compatible with existing
     applications and protocols.


3.2 Request-Routing System Type Requirements

   The following section describes the information exchange protocol
   requirements that apply to both DNS-based and in-line request-routing
   systems.

     - Request-routing protocols SHOULD support DNS-based and in-line
     request-routing system types.

     - Request-routing protocols MUST be extensible to support other
     request routing system types.

     - Request-routing protocols MUST communicate their request-routing

Internet-Draft                                             February 2002


     system type to neighbors (e.g. DNS-based).

     - Request-routing protocols MAY allow for utilization of more than
     one request-routing system type for content.

     - Request-routing protocols MUST be able to identify content types
     for content.


3.2.1 DNS-Based Request-Routing Requirements

   The following section describes the information exchange protocol
   requirements that apply to DNS-based request-routing system types.

     - Request-routing protocols MUST support CNAME based DNS
     redirection.

     - Request-routing protocols MUST be able to map content types to
     CNAMEs in order to make proper direction decisions.


3.2.2 In-Line Based Request-Routing Requirements

   The following section describes the information exchange protocol
   requirements that apply to in-line based request-routing system
   types.

     - Request-routing protocols MUST support application layer
     redirection (e.g.  HTTP redirection).

     - Request-routing protocols SHOULD support explicitly configured
     application gateways and proxies.


3.3 Request-Routing Interconnection Model Requirements

   The following section describes the information exchange protocol
   requirements for the model of CN interconnection.

     - Request-routing protocols MUST allow for delegation of requests
     to another request-routing system.

     - Request-routing protocols SHOULD support both iterative and
     recursive redirection models.

     - Request-routing protocols SHOULD require that content have only
     one authoritative request-routing system.

     - Request-routing protocols MUST verify that neighbor CNs have the
     ability to deliver content before directing requests to that
     neighbor.


3.4 Request-Routing System Capabilities Requirements

Internet-Draft                                             February 2002


   The following section describes the information exchange protocol
   requirements for request-routing system capability information.

     - Request-routing protocols MUST support the advertisement of
     content type information between neighbors.

     - Request-routing protocols SHOULD have primitive methods for
     capability advertisement.


3.5 Request-Routing Information Exchange Requirements



3.5.1 General Information Exchange Requirements

   The following section describes the information exchange protocol
   requirements with respect to general types of information exchanged.

     - Request-routing protocols MUST define standardized methods for
     identifying an atomic unit of content.

     - Request-routing protocols MUST define standardized methods for
     identifying distribution system capabilities (e.g. content types,
     layer-3 coverage, etc).

     - Request-routing protocol MUST not preclude request-routing
     systems from implementing policy based routing decisions.

     - Request-routing protocols MUST support the exchange of multiple
     basic information types (e.g. area and content advertisements).

     - Request-routing protocols MUST be able to associate multiple (and
     optional) metrics with each basic information types.

     - Request-routing protocols MUST exchange information sufficient to
     avoid looping of information advertisements.

     - Request-routing protocols MAY exchange information sufficient to
     prevent request-routing loops.


3.5.2 Specific Information Exchange Requirements

   The following section describes the information exchange protocol
   requirements with respect to specific types of information exchanged.

     - Request-routing protocols MUST support the exchange of area
     advertisements (e.g. IP prefixes) between request-routing systems.

     - Request-routing protocol area advertisements MUST support the
     inclusion of multiple capabilities and metrics (e.g. X Mbps, Y CIDR
     blocks, Z static http).

Internet-Draft                                             February 2002


     - Request-routing protocols SHOULD define a minimum set of metrics
     for area advertisements.

     - Request-routing protocols MUST support the exchange of content
     advertisements (e.g. URIs) between request-routing systems.

     - Request-routing protocol content advertisements MUST support the
     inclusion of multiple metrics.

     - Request-routing protocol content advertisements MUST support the
     ability to advertise the availability of content.

     - Request-routing protocol content advertisements SHOULD identify
     the authoritative request-routing system.

     - Request-routing protocols SHOULD define a minimum set of metrics
     for content advertisements.

     - Request-routing protocols MUST accommodate hierarchy and
     aggregation in content and area advertisements.


3.6 Request-Routing Decision and Policy Requirements

   The following section describes the information exchange protocol
   requirements with respect to request-routing decision making.

     - Request-routing protocols MUST be "policy friendly" (e.g. support
     additional neighbor-to-neighbor extensible attributes).

     - Request-routing protocols SHOULD support exchange of information
     sufficient to prevent routing loops.

     - Request-routing protocols MAY support multiple metrics for
     direction decisions as long as routing decisions can be guaranteed
     loop free.


3.7 Request-Routing Information Exchange Protocol Attribute Requirements

   The following section describes the information exchange protocol
   requirements with respect to the specific attributes of the protocol
   design itself.  Note that some of these requirements are redundant
   with other sections; we repeat them here for organization.

     - Request-routing protocols MUST use a reliable transport protocol.

     - Request-routing protocols MUST make use of existing IETF
     developed security mechanisms for encryption and authentication.

     - Request-routing protocols MUST include protocol notifications for
     protocol error conditions.

     - Request-routing protocols SHOULD be connection oriented.

     - Request-routing protocols MUST provide mechanisms to prevent
     looping of advertisement information.

     - Request-routing protocols MUST have extensible packet formats.

     - Request-routing protocols MUST properly identify neighbors.

     - Request-routing protocols MUST properly authenticate neighbors.

     - Request-routing protocols MUST scale to accommodate the exchange
     of large sets of content and area advertisements.

     - Request-routing protocols MUST support (at a minimum) a simple
     capability exchange/advertisement.

     - Request-routing protocols MUST NOT exchange policy information.

     - Request-routing protocols MUST accommodate policy based request-
     routing systems.
