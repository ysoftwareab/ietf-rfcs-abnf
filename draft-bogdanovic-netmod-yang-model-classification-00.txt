Internet-Draft          YANG model classification          February 2015

   WG: Working Group

2.  Problem Statement

   YANG is becoming de facto standard language for network modeling in
   the industry.  There is big adoption movement at the moment and many
   models are being developed and published, by multiple SDOs, different
   consortiums, ad hoc groups and OSP.  Today there is no classification
   of models, there are no clear guidelines on how to layer models on
   each other, or how to classify existing or new models.  With this
   draft, author is proposing a new way for YANG model classifications.

3.  Network YANG data model layers

   When developing models, there are two approaches possible, top down
   and bottom up.  Top down approach is driven by business requirements
   and bottom up is driven by technological ones.  In general, we can
   classify data models into three categories:

      configuration

      service

      business

   Base model for all other models is the configuration model.  It
   describes all configurable capabalities of the device and what device
   vendor exposes for configuration.  We can divide the configuration
   model into two types:

   a.  vendor configuration model

   b.  standard configuration model

3.1.  Configuration models

3.1.1.  Vendor configuration model

   Vendor configuration model is the superset for the network model
   supported on the device.  All other models are derived based on this
   model.  Although all vendors provide very similar functionality using
   standards, implementations are different.  One of basic examples are
   dynamic routing protocols.  We can see today two main types of
   routing protocol configuration.

      protocol centric - all the protocol related config is contained
      with the protocol itself.  Especially in case of multiple
      instances of the routing protocol running in different routing-
      instances (routing-instance as described in core routing model
      [I-D.ietf-netmod-routing-cfg]), all the routing-instance protocol
      config is contained in the default routing instance.

               Router ospf 10
               Default-metric 100
               Address-family ipv4 vrf VRF1
                   Network x.x.x.x area 0

               Address-family ipv4 vrf VRF2
                   Network x.x.x.x area 0

               Address-family ipv4
                   Network x.x.x.x area 1

      In term of YANG model, the routing protocol configuration will be
      defined within the default routing-instance and the routing-
      protocol config will contain multiple instances referring to other
      routing-instances.

      VRF centric - All the protocol related config for a routing-
      instance is contained within this routing-instance.

               Routing-instance VRF1 {
                 Protocols isis {

                 }
               }
               Routing-instance VRF2 {
                 Protocols isis {

                 }
               }

      In term of YANG model, the routing protocol configuration for a
      routing-instance will be defined within the associated routing-
      instance.

3.1.2.  Standard configuration model

   With YANG we have a common language, that enables different
   communities to express data models that are widely understandable
   without lot of additional explanation.  This enables different groups
   to standardize data models and vendors to support them, which will

   make it easier to for network operators to manage their network
   configuration programmatically.

   IETF, as SDO, is really well positioned to standardize configuration
   models.  With a wide range of expertize found within its WGs focused
   on protocol definitions.  As IETF participants implement those
   protocols, they have deep expertize about the implementation and
   finding a common base standard configuration model between vendors
   should be a very viable goal.

   The standard configuration model is a subset of vendor configuration
   model.  The standard configuration model can be broken into base
   model and standard extension models, where the base is common data
   model and standard extensions are standard features which can not be
   all implemented by vendors.  Example of standard base model is Access
   Control List and routing filter is a standard extension on ACL.  Or
   another example: encryption algorithm is standard feature, but the
   different types, like md5, hmac-md5, hmac-sha1, etc are standard
   extensions, as it is not that all vendors have all encryption
   algorithm types implemented.

3.2.  Network service models

   As YANG is used to describe configuration models of a device,
   standard and vendor proprietary models, the language can be used also
   to describe network service models.  Network service models are
   created by network operators when they choose how to configure their
   network from technology point of view.  They decide which technology
   is best match for their business needs and based on that create
   network service data models.  With more and more configuration models
   being available, both vendor and standards one, network service model
   developer can create reusable components based on the configuration
   models, and use those service components data models to create end to
   end service model.

3.2.1.  Service component data model

   Service component is specific way how operator is using configuration
   options in the data model to create part of a service.  Such example
   can be iBGP.  Full BGP configuration model is available as vendor and
   standard models, but service model developer has a choice to create
   iBGP as separate service component that can be reused in other
   models.  There can be multiple iBGP service component models, as not
   all service model developers have to use same abstraction, and it can
   be helpful to have multiple models developed that cover different use
   cases.

Internet-Draft          YANG model classification          February 2015


3.2.2.  Network service data model

   Network service data models can be developed in multiple ways.
   Building them monolithic from vendor models or by combining one or
   more service components into an end to end service data model.  It
   specifies complete service that is provided by the network operator.
   Building monolithic network service model has an advantage of doing
   it fast, but at the expense of flexibility of updating the service
   later or switching vendors.  Such an end to end service can be VPLS/
   VPWS L2VPN, IPsec, etc.  If we take into example VPLS L2VPN service,

3.3.  Business service model

   Business service models are the top level and are very customer
   specific.  Vendors don't know what is important to the carrier from
   OSS perspective.  That is known to the network operator and their
   customer specific use cases.  Business service developer can create a
   very high level model, for example: customer LAN service

             container customer {
               description "adding metro LAN customers"
               leaf customer-name{
                 description virtual LAN customer name";
                 type string;
               }
               leaf interface-name{
                 description "metro LAN customer interface"
                 type interface-name;
               }
               leaf site-name{
                 description "customer site name";
                 type string;
               }
             }

   The model above is a simple business model.  It can be exposed to
   external applications that can very effecitively create a new
   service.  The application developer doesn't have to know the
   underlying technology used, as it potentially would have no meaning
   if exposed as network service model name VPLS L2VPN.  The network
   service model might have some parameters that would have no meaning
   to the end developer, like route-distiguisher, vrf-target, instance-
   type.  These parameters can be very effectively hidden from the high
   level business service API consumer.

4.  Dependencies between models

   As mentioned earlier in this document, there are two ways of
   designing models, top down and bottom up with one restriction.
   Everything is dependent on the vendor data model.  That model
   describes all the possibilities and if model developers prefers, they
   can use vendor model only to design service components, network
   service and business service.  Using vendor model provides all
   capabilities today, but it comes with restrictions of portability
   between vendors and to certain extent devices.  On the other hand,
   only standard models and standard extensions can be used, but this
   might result in less feature rich or less efficient services.
   Service model developer has a choice to reuse service components or
   write a model completely based on vendor data model.

   There are no hard requirements on how to do the modeling, but it
   would be useful to have a classification and to create models that
   can be easily reused, as with this time and energy will be saved in
   future development.  We should stimulate both development styles,
   bottom up and top down, as each has its benefits and groups to which
   a certain style will be more appealing then the other.
