                                 Abstract

   This contribution describes a registration protocol that can be used
   between gateways (GWs) and severs as well as among servers in intra-
   ITAD communications environment. The registration protocol is used
   by a GW just to inform its transport address and reachable alias
   addresses including telephone numbers through it along with other
   information (e.g., capacity, cost, traffic, usage, QoS, GoS) to the
   Server and does not deal with any routes or path attributes.
   The registration protocol is also used to negotiate capabilities
   between the peers. The registration protocol will be a part for
   building a single unified intra-ITAD protocol described in a
   following contribution. The proposed message formats of the intra-

   ITAD protocol including the registration message are similar to
   TRIP.

   We have also analyzed that the proposed registration protocol is
   superior to the existing registration protocols (SIP, TRIP and
   H.323) meeting all requirements to provide scalable solution.

Internet Draft            Registration Protocol         August 31, 2001




1. Introduction

   In IP-PSTN interworking environment, a SIP [2] call from the IP
   network may traverse to the PSTN network via a gateway (GW). A
   telephony or SIP-H.323 GW connected to the IP network needs to bind
   with the location server (LS) [3] a set of telephone
   numbers/prefixes or aliases to its address that can be reachable for
   SIP calls. Similarly, a SIP server also requires to find telephony
   or H.323 GWs to route SIP calls with PSTN or H.323 destinations.

   In TRIP [3], a Location Server (LS) takes the routing decision and,
   a LS can be co-located with a call signaling server like SIP. A LS
   can also be called a Route Server (RS). For simplicity, a LS (or RS)
   is also referred as server in this contribution. Like TRIP, it is
   also assumed that a location server (or router server) is co-located
   with a call signaling server like SIP. However, a LS (or RS) will
   have the intelligence for routing. The proposed discovery protocol
   will be used between GWs and Servers as well as among the Servers.

   A GW [4, 5] connected to the IP network needs registration with the
   SIP Server/location server (LS) a set of telephone numbers/prefixes
   or other aliases to its address that can be reachable for SIP calls.
   However, a GW does not have the routing capacity to make any
   decision and does not deal with any path or route attributes. In
   this scenario, a GW needs to discover [6] a SIP Server/LS for
   registration through which it can advertise the reachable
   destination addresses so that a SIP call can be routed through it.
   In another scenario, a SIP Sever/LS needs to discover [6] a GWs and
   initiates the registration of the GWs through which it can route
   calls if the GWs are not registered.

3. Registration Protocol Description

   The registration protocol provides the actual information about the
   peers for ongoing communications. A registration protocol is needed
   to inform the SIP Server/LS by a GW of its transport and alias
   addresses. Similar is the case for a SIP Server/LS where it can also
   register with all its SIP Servers/LSs peers. However, a GW (or SIP
   Server/LS) needs to know the SIP Server/LS before registration. A GW


   Radhika R. Roy                                             [Page 3]

Internet Draft            Registration Protocol         August 31, 2001



   (or SIP server/LS) will know its Server/LS through auto-discovery
   [6] process.

   Registration needs to occur before the call setup so that a SIP
   Server/LS can route the SIP call to the appropriate GWs knowing the
   destination addresses provided within the call and may occur
   periodically as necessary (e.g., its power-up after maintenance). A
   GW may register a single or multiple transport and/or alias
   addresses. The use of the multiple transport addresses may simplify
   the routing of calls to specific ports. However, a GW shall register
   with one SIP Server/LS while a SIP Server/LS can register with all
   its SIP Servers/LSs peers. The reason for registering of a GW with
   only one SIP Server/LS because of better management, but there is no
   limitation from the protocol point of view. It is also assumed that
   all SIP Servers/LSs will be communicating exchanging information
   among themselves and synchronize their information about all
   registered GWs.

   Should a SIP call arrive to the SIP Server/LS and the said server
   does not have the information about the GW(s), the sever can
   discover [6] the GW(s) for initiating registration with it. After
   registration of the information of the GW(s), the server can take
   decision which GW needs to be contacted to route a call. In this
   scenario, the call setup time will be little more that of the
   earlier case described above.


3.1 SIP Server/LS Registration by the GW

   All peers can register with one another using the _REGISTER_
   message. A GW (or SIP Server/LS) shall send a _REGISTER_ request
   message to a SIP Server/LS. This message is sent to the
   Server's/LS's transport address. The GW (or SIP Server/LS) has the
   network address of the SIP Server/LS known from the discovery [6]
   process and uses the well-known port. The SIP Server/LS will respond
   with either _CONFIRM_ or _REJECT_ message. The rejection of the
   registration message may include many reasons including security,
   policy, and others.

   A GW shall only register with a single SIP Server/LS, but a SIP
   Server/LS can register with all its SIP servers/LSs peers. This is
   done for better management of the system. However, in the
   confirmation message, a SIP Server/LS may send a list of alternate
   SIP Servers/LSs in accordance to priority because a GW (or SIP
   server/LS) may need to register with the alternate Servers/LSs
   should the primary Server/LS fails. Similarly, a GW may also provide
   the information about the alternate GWs where the SIP Server/LS can
   communicate should the primary GW fail. It will increase the
   reliability of the system.


   Radhika R. Roy                                             [Page 4]

Internet Draft            Registration Protocol         August 31, 2001



   The _REGISTER_ message may be repeated periodically (i.e., at GW
   power-up after maintenance), so the Server/LS shall be able to
   handle multiple requests from the same GW. However, a SIP Server/LS
   may receive the registration message with different combinations of
   the alias and the transport address and, it will respond in those
   conditions as follows:

   . If a SIP Server/LS receives a _REGISTER_ request message having
     the same alias address and the same transport address as a
     previous _REGISTER_, it shall respond with the _CONFRIM_ message.

   . If a SIP Server/LS receives a _REGISTER_ request message having
     the same alias address as a previous _REGISTER_ request message
     and a different transport address, it may confirm the request, if
     it conforms the request with the SIP Server's/LS's security
     policy. Otherwise, it should reject the registration indicating a
     duplicate registration.

   . If the SIP Server/LS receives a _REGISTER_ request message having
     the same transport address as a previous REGISTER request and a
     different alias address, it should replace the translation table
     entries. The SIP Server/LS may have a method to authenticate these
     changes.

   Similar is the case for the SIP Server/LS when it registers with its
   SIP Servers/LSs peers.


3.1.1 Alternate Peers

   Alternate peers can also be associated using the discovery [6]
   message. In order to enhance reliability in the system which uses a
   Server/LS, the Server/LS may indicate alternate Servers/LSs that may
   be used in the event of a primary Server/LS failure. The list of
   alternate Servers/LSs can be provided in the _Alternate-Server_
   structure of the _CONFIRM_ and _REJECT_ messages. Similarly, the
   alternate GW addresses can also be provided by the _REGISTER_
   request message. When a SIP Server/LS discover other peers, they can
   also provide the list alternate peers to which it can register if
   the primary one fails.


3.1.2 Registration Time (RT)

   The registration of the GW with the SIP Server/LS may have a finite
   lifetime. A GW (or SIP Server/LS) may request a _Time-To-Live_ in
   the _REGISTER_ request message to the SIP Server/LS and, the SIP
   Server/LS may respond with a _CONFIRM_ response message containing
   the same registration time or a shorter registration time. After
   this time, the registration shall be expired.

   Radhika R. Roy                                             [Page 5]

Internet Draft            Registration Protocol         August 31, 2001






3.1.3 Registration Time Extension (RTE)

   Prior to the expiration of the registration time, a GW (or SIP
   Server/LS) may send the _KEEP-ALIVE-MESSAGE_ requesting for
   extension of the registration time._ This shall reset the _Time-To-
   Live_ parameter in the SIP Server/LS, allowing the registration to
   be extended. After the expiration time, the GW (or SIP Server/LS)
   must re-register with the SIP Server/LS.

   If a GW (or SIP Server/LS) does not include the registration time
   value in _Time-To-Live_ field of its _CONFIRM_ message, the
   registered GW (or SIP Server/LS) shall consider that the SIP
   Server/LS is not supporting the RTE mechanism and no indication for
   the RTE shall be provided in the subsequent messages indicating that
   the SIP Server/LS is not supporting the RTE mechanism.


3.1.4 Alternate GW

   It has been explained earlier to deal with alternate peers. The SIP
   Server/LS shall ensure that each alias address translate into a
   single transport address. However, a GW may be able to indicate a
   backup, redundant, or alternate transport address using the
   _Alternate GW_ field. This will allow a GW to have a secondary
   network interface or a secondary GW as a backup. In any case, any
   ambiguous registration will be rejected by the SIP Server/LS.


3.1.5 Capacity/Performance/Services Attributes

   A GW will be able to send all the attributes related to capacity,
   performance and services for registration.

   For example, the parameters like number of calls [total, spare],
   number of ports [total, spare], number of circuits and speeds
   [total, spare], etc.), QoS, GoS, codecs, bridging capabilities, and
   others parameters that a GW likes to send for registration. A SIP
   Server/LS will then be able to advertise these parameters.


3.2 Registration Cancellation

   A GW may cancel its registration by sending the _REGISTER_ message
   using the NULL value (or *) in the alias address field or address
   structure. The registration cancellation request can be confirmed or
   rejected using _CONFIRM_ or _REJECT_ message, respectively. In the
   case of rejection, the reject reason needs to be sent.

3.3 SIP Server/LS and GW Registration Message Flows

   A simple high-level message flows is shown in Figure 1. In this
   scenario, a GW sends the RREGISTER message to the SIP Server/LS
   whose address is known by the GW at the time of discovery [6].

   GW                   SIP Server/LS

   |      REGISTER          |
   |----------------------->|
   |   CONFIRM or REJECT    |
   |<-----------------------|
   |                        |

   Figure 2 shows the registration cancellation with the SIP Server/LS
   by the GW.

   GW                   SIP Server/LS

   |      REGISTER*         |
   |----------------------->|
   |   CONFIRM or REJECT    |
   |<-----------------------|
   |                        |

   * REGISTER message with NULL value (*) in the address field

   Figure 2: Registration cancellation with a SIP Server/LS by a GW

   The registration is also cancelled at the expiration of the
   registration time and no extension of the registration time is made
   before expiration.


3.4 Behavior of SIP Server/LS and GW for Registration Messages

   All GWs shall register with the SIP Server/LS in an ITAD identified
   through the discovery process [6] as a part of their configuration.
   As a result, every GW is required to implement the REGISTER,
   CONFIRM, and REJECT message. These messages will be sent to the SIP
   Server/LS or GW to the known addresses when association is made
   during the discovery process [6].

   Once the SIP Server/LS is discovered, a GW proceeds for the
   initiation of the call or a GW prepares for receiving the call.

   A GW which is not registered with the SIP Server/LS cannot request
   any services from the SIP Server/LS and so cannot participate in

   Radhika R. Roy                                             [Page 8]

Internet Draft            Registration Protocol         August 31, 2001



   advertisement of reachability of destination addresses through it,
   its capacity, and other functions performed by the SIP Server/LS.


3.5 ITAD Topology and Registration Mechanism

   An ITAD topology is expected to have at least a single SIP Server/LS
   or multiple SIP Servers/LSs.

   In the case of a single SIP Server/LS, the network configuration is
   straight forward. All GWs will be able to auto-discover [6] the SIP
   Server/LS and, shall register with the SIP Server/LS whose address
   will be known during the discovery process [6]. A GW may also be
   able to register the backup GW(s) during the registration process to
   enhance the reliability.

   A single SIP Server/LS is likely to become an increasingly critical
   single point of failure eventually. A desire to have SIP Servers/LSs
   to back each other (e.g., alternate Servers as explained earlier) up
   or to serve different regions of very large networks characterizes
   the next level. However, a network (e.g., intranet) needs not be
   truly large before it may become convenient to use multiple SIP
   Servers/LSs.

Internet Draft            Registration Protocol         August 31, 2001





3.6 Registration Protocol Semantics

   The REGISTER message needs to have the following information:

   . Protocol Identifier: The protocol that is being used for the
     registration request (REGISTER) message. For example, REGISTER
     messages can be a part of the intra-ITAD protocol.

   . Transport Address: The transport address of the GW that is used
     for the registration message by the GW.

   . Entity Type: The entity (e.g., GW) that is sending the
     registration message. For example, it can be GW (POTS/PSTN/ISDN,
     SIP-H.323, MEGACO/H.248), SIP Server/LS, etc.

   . Entity Identifier: An identifier that is provided by the SIP
     Server/LS after confirming the registration that may need to be
     used in the subsequent REGISTER messages for extension of
     registration time for example.

   . Discovery Complete: This field shall be set to TRUE or FALSE. If
     the discovery of the SIP Server/LS is already done, this field
     should be set to TRUE. This field will be set to FALSE, if it is
     done only for registration without performing the discovery of the
     SIP Server/LS, but the GW will get the response from the Server/LS
     that the GW should perform the discovery [dynamic or static].

   . Server/LS Identifier: The Server/LS identity to which the GW would
     like register.

   . Entity Alias: A list of alias addresses, by which other entities
     (e.g., SIP Servers/LSs) may identify this entity (e.g. GW) that is
     sending the registration request message.

   . Alternate Entities: A sequence of prioritized GW alternatives for
     transport address, entity type, or entity alias.

   . Registration Time: The duration of the validity of the
     registration, in seconds. After this time, the SIP Server/LS may
     consider the registration stale.

   . Registration Time Extension: It is set either as TRUE or as FALSE.
     If this field is set TRUE, it indicates that the GW has sent the
     REGISTER message for extending the registration time.

   . Capacity/Performance/Services Attributes: The parameters like
     number of calls [total, spare], number of ports [total, spare],
     number of circuits and speeds [total, spare], etc.), QoS, GoS,

   Radhika R. Roy                                            [Page 10]

Internet Draft            Registration Protocol         August 31, 2001



     codecs, bridging capabilities, and others that a GW likes to send
     for registration.

   . Security Parameters: Authentication mechanisms, encryption
     algorithms, integrity mechanisms, token, etc. may be specified, if
     needed.

   The confirmation and cancellation of the registration Request shall
   be done using CONFIRM and REJECT message, respectively. The
   information elements of these messages are shown in contribution
   [6].

   However, the registration cancellation can be made by sending the
   REGISTER message with NULL value (or *) in the alias address
   information field.


3.6.1 Common Message Elements

   The above analysis shows that the common message elements for all
   messages can be as follows:

   . Message Sequence Number
   . Protocol Identifier
   . Transport Address
   . Entity Type
   . Entity Alias

   Similarly, the request and response discovery [6] messages will also
   have the common message elements.


3.6.2 Transport for Registration Protocol

   Either reliable (e.g., TCP) or unreliable (e.g., UDP) can be used as
   the transport protocol for the registration protocol.















   Radhika R. Roy                                            [Page 11]

Internet Draft            Registration Protocol         August 31, 2001



3.7 Registration Protocol Syntax

   The messages that need to be used by GWs and SIP Servers/LSs for
   registration are RGISTER, CONFIRM, REJECT.

   Again, any updates are made by any GWs, the same also need to be
   propagated to all SIP Servers/LSs. The most important thing is that,
   unlike TRIP [3], none of these messages require route selection and
   route aggregation.

   Like TRIP [3], a _KeepAlive-Message_ may also be needed for both GW-
   Server/LS and Server/LS-Server-LS communications to detect failures.

   The detail of the REGISTER, CONFIRM [6], and REJECT [6] messages
   have been described.

   Like TRIP [3], a MESSAGE-UPDATE request also needs to be defined for
   the intra-ITAD protocol.

   Finally, the syntax of the Intra-ITAD protocol can also be written
   in accordance to TRIP [3] protocol. The proposed message formats of
   the discovery message can be seen in another contribution as a part
   of the a single unified intra-ITAD protocol.


4. Issues with the Registration Protocol

   The issues that we need to resolve with the discovery protocol can
   be summarized as follows:

   . Do we include email and other alias addresses in addition to
     telephone addresses (E.164)?

   . Do we allow a GW to register with the alternate SIP Servers/LSs
     for increasing reliability in order of priority in case of the
     primary SIP Server/LS fails?

   . Should we rely on alternative mechanisms such as TLS, IPsec, etc.
     instead of considering for individual messages?


5. Analysis of the Registration Protocol in view of its Requirements

   The proposed registration protocol uses RGISTER, CONFIRM, REJECT
   messages as a part of the overall intra-ITAD (or domain) protocol.
   This protocol messages are not tied to the call control messages
   directly because it is assumed that the registration us performed
   before any initiation is made.



   Radhika R. Roy                                            [Page 12]

Internet Draft            Registration Protocol         August 31, 2001



   Therefore, it allows to proceed the calls fast as the registration
   is done independent before the call setup.

   The features like reliability, security, timeliness, efficient,
   Server control, and independent policy control for both the GW and
   the SIP Server/LS are also the inherent property of the said
   registration protocol.

   Therefore, the proposed registration protocol meets all the
   requirements that have been envisioned.


6. Policy

   One of the requirements has been that each SIP Server/LS and each GW
   be allowed to apply its policy independently although the SIP
   Server/LS should have the control whether a GW can register with a
   SIP Server/LS or a call to be routed through a particular GW. The
   proposed registration protocol meets this requirement.

   However, like discovery protocol [6], we have not specified a
   particular standard mechanism for policy either for the SIP
   Server/LS or for the GW. We believe that the standardization of
   policy may be addressed separately.


7. Security

   Like discovery protocol [6], we have not proposed any particular
   security scheme for the registration protocol. We like to address
   the security mechanism in the context of the overall intra-domain
   protocol.


8. GW Registration using Other Methods


8.1 SIP

   The other registration schemes like SIP's REGISTER method [2] can
   also do the registration. However, The REGISTER mechanism is used to
   bind a single incoming URI to one or more outgoing URIs. In the case
   of a telephony gateway, the binding is between a set of telephone
   prefixes to the address of a gateway. This is a significantly
   different binding, and cannot be represented with the syntax or
   semantics of a SIP REGISTER request [8].

   However, there is no discovery mechanism for the SIP Server/LS and,
   as such, there is no clear relationship between the association of
   the SIP Server/LS during discovery and the registration process.

   Radhika R. Roy                                            [Page 13]

Internet Draft            Registration Protocol         August 31, 2001



   Therefore, SIP's registration mechanism does not satisfy the
   requirement for the intra-ITAD communications.


8.2 TRIP-GW

   TRIP-GW's [8] messages (e.g., OPEN) can also be used what is being
   done by the REGISTER message as described in this contribution.
   However, registration needs to proceed after discovery and, TRIP-GW
   does not have any discovery mechanisms. TRIP's TCP-based connection-
   oriented transport seems to be good for point-to-point communication
   where topology is priori known.

   TRIP [3] does not provide any mechanism for discovery of its peers _
   SIP Servers/LSs and, thereby, cannot associate the addresses of the
   SIP Servers/LSs to the GWs for registration dynamically. It appears
   that a new protocol is needed for discovery in TRIP.

   Updates of the information need to be sent among the servers and,
   GWs also need to send updates to Servers.

   Both discovery and updates mechanisms are efficient for multicasting
   and, auto-discovery is not possible without multicasting in one-to-
   many communications environment. For this, reason, UDP transport is
   needed. But TRIP uses flooding with limited broadcast with TCP-based
   transport assuming a pre-provisioned configuration.

   Considering the overall requirements of the intra-ITAD
   communications, it would better to optimize all messages along with
   the use of transport for the intra-ITAD communications. A single
   unified intra-ITAD protocol that includes discovery, registration,
   update, keep-alive, confirmation, and error-notification appears to
   be the most efficient solution.


8.3 H.323

   H.323 [9] also has a method for registration as a part of H.225.0
   RAS signaling messages. All endpoints in a given zone need to
   register with a gatekeeper of that zone and, a zone is controlled by
   a gatekeeper.

   In our case, there is no concept of zone or similar to this for
   registration with a SIP Server/LS by a GW. Again, a server may also
   be allowed to registered with many other servers in an ITAD and,
   this concept is not allowed in H.323. Many semantics are also not
   the same based on our requirements. Finally, our syntaxes are also
   different.

9. Conclusion

   We have proposed a registration protocol that meets all requirements
   for the intra-ITAD communications. The proposed registration
   protocol is efficient and scalable considering the large-scale
   network in comparison with other existing registration protocols.
   The semantics of the protocol have also been defined.

   We have also described briefly the similarity and differences of the
   registration process described in this contribution with others such
   as SIP's REGISTER method [2] and H.323's REGISTRATION REQUEST [9].
   Although TRIP's OPEN message can meet the registration requirements
   only for the pre-provisioned configurations or once the discovery is
   done. That is, a new protocol is needed for discovery in TRIP-GW
   [8]. Moreover, the flooding mechanism is also not efficient where
   multicasting can be used.

   Either a reliable (e.g., TCP) or a unreliable (e.g., UDP) transport
   protocol can be used for registration process.

   However, we believe that the syntax of the protocol be defined using
   the TRIP {3] protocol.

   We have proposed that a complete set of intra-ITAD protocol can be
   defined using _DISCOVER, CONFIRM, REJECT, REGISTER, MESSAGE-UPDATE,
   and KEEP-ALIVE-MESSAGE._ This combine set of protocol can be termed
   as Intra-ITAD protocol as described in another contribution [10].

   The security of the discovery protocol will be addressed in the
   light of the overall security of the Intra-ITAD protocol.

   The standardization of the policy protocol will be addressed
   separately.

   There are some issues related to the security and the overall
   approach of the Intra-ITAD protocol. We have provided some
   suggestions how these issues can be addressed.
