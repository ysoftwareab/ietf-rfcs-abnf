Abstract

   The multicast concept for packet-oriented networks has been widely
   studied during the past years due to the exponential increasing
   number of bandwidth-intensive multicast-based applications. Today,
   optical networks with Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)
   capabilities offer an excellent deployment field for such

   applications. By extending the multicast concept for optical
   networks, applications such as Optical Broadband, Video, HDTV, and
   Multimedia can be provided with enhanced performance while
   optimizing the network resource utilization.

   In the optical domain, whilst optical unicast connections carried on
   lightpaths are point-to-point connections, optical multicast refers
   to point-to-multipoint connections which are realized by using
   light-trees. Nodes traversed by a light-tree must include optical
   signal power splitters. A (passive) optical power splitter divides
   the power of the input signal equally into more than one output
   signal; thus reducing the input signalÆs power by a factor of the
   number of outputs.

   This document reviews the main concepts related to optical
   multicast, the architectural objectives and the key design tradeoffs
   when deploying optical multicast-capable networks. It also examines
   the main issues related to signalling protocols extensions to enable
   a Generalized MPLS-based distributed control for optical multicast-
   capable networks.

1. Introduction

   In the memo, we develop the basic concepts and future developments
   needed in the design of optical multicast-capable networks.

   The concept of multicast has been widely discussed for packetû
   oriented networks during the past years. This proposal extends the
   multicast concept to optical networks, which provide enhanced
   performance for, multicast as well as broadcast-based applications.
   The applications that can benefit from the optical multicast concept
   are numerous and cover a wide range of current ôclientö needs. These
   applications mainly cover Optical Broadband (Video, HDTV,
   Multimedia, etc.) applications and Optical Storage Area Networks (O-
   SAN).

   The architecture of optical multicast-capable networks needs to
   balance potentially conflicting design and performance criteria,
   including:
   - Minimizing the number of nodes traversed (in particular nodes
     including optical splitters)
   - Minimizing some combination of the number of transceivers,
     optical amplifiers and optical splitters
   - Maximizing the virtual connectivity between nodes of interest
   - Maintaining a reasonable optical power budget
   - Solving the Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) problem for
     both unicast and multicast connections.
   - Minimize the blocking probability (the wavelength continuity
     problem in multicast networks also referred to as MCRWA Problem)

   This contribution reviews the relationships between these tradeoffs.

   In the optical domain, whilst optical unicast connections carried on
   lightpaths are point-to-point connections, optical multicast refers
   to point-to-multipoint connections which are realized by using
   light-trees. Nodes traversed by a light-tree must include optical
   signal power splitters. An optical power splitter divides the power
   of the input signal equally into more than one output signal; thus
   reducing the input signalÆs power by a factor of the number of
   outputs. Therefore, optical splitter is the key component to realize
   multicast in optical networks. The concept of optical multicast is
   becoming possible since 1:2 and 1:4 splitters are widely available
   and more recently 1:8 splitters have been developed. The distinction
   between a optical splitter and an optical tap is related to the
   output signal ratio: with a splitter the output signal power is
   equally distributed in contrast with a tap the output signal power
   ratio is non-equally distributed while only a fraction of the signal
   power is tapped (e.g. sufficient for feeding a host, for instance).

2. Rationale for Optical Multicast

   By extending the multicast technology into the optical domain, one
   offers the following features and advantages which are related to
   critical aspects of current optical networks:
   - Protection: efficient optical channel and line dedicated
     protection
   - Performance: improved performance (no store and forward) compared
     to packet-oriented multicast technology
   - Cost Reduction: reduction of the total number of transceivers
     deployed in optical networks
   - Resource utilization: overall network throughput improvement by
     reducing the number of wavelengths used per fiber link (i.e.
     minimizing the overall bandwidth usage per fiber link)

   However, the major drawback to overcome in optical multicast-capable
   networks is to compensate the power penalty introduced during the
   optical signal splitting.

   Moreover, the multicast problem in communication networks, described
   by the Steiner Tree Problem applied to communication networks is NP-
   Complete [6]. The Steiner Tree Problem is defined as follows. Given
   a Graph G(V,E) where V is a Vertex and E an Edge; a cost function
   applied to each of the edge of the graph G; and a set of node N
   included within the graph G; find a sub-tree T = (V[T], E[T])
   spanning N and such that its cost C (defined as the sum of
   individual edge cost C(E)) is minimized. For more detailed
   explanations concerning this problem and related computational
   aspects, we refer to [14].

   Since the Steiner Tree problem is NP-Complete, some heuristics are
   needed to setup multicast trees in an efficient way. Notice that
   this problem is not restricted to the optical domain. Consequently,
   there is a method to optimize the topology of an optical network
   exists in theory. However, in practice it is not possible to
   analytically solve this optimization problem and a heuristic

   approach is required. For instance, in packet-based multicast
   networks, shortest-path trees are computed in order to implement a
   fully distributed on-line computation of the ômulticast-treesö.

3. Lightpath and Light-tree Concepts

   This section details the concepts of lightpath (Section 3.1) and
   light-tree (Section 3.2).

   In the context of this memo, we assume that an Optical Cross-Connect
   (OXC) is defined as an O/E/O capable device on each of its
   interfaces while a Photonic Cross-Connect (PXC) is defined as an O-O
   device. We also assume that an OXC-based network defines a non-
   transparent network while a PXC-based network defines an all-optical
   (or transparent) network.

3.1 Lightpath

   A lightpath is defined in the context of wavelength (or optical
   channel) switched networks including either Photonic Cross-Connect
   (PXC) when referring to all-optical networks or Optical Cross-
   Connect (OXC) when referring to a non-transparent optical networks.

   A unicast connection i.e. a point-to-point connection, in a non-
   transparent (or all-) optical network is carried on a lightpath.
   Such connection is defined as a non-transparent (or all-) optical
   channel and is used to transparently transport packets or circuits
   throughout the optical network. In non-transparent optical networks,
   the number of transmitters (Tx) needed to setup unicast connections
   equals the number of receivers (Rx). In all-optical networks, this
   equality applies as well because we include within the total number
   of transmitters and receivers the ones belonging to the source and
   the destination node interfaces of the point-to-point connections
   (i.e. not only the intermediate nodes).

   Example:

   LetÆs consider an optical network including N nodes and M source or
   destination nodes as indicated here:

                                             ---- D
                                            /
                                           /     ...
                                          /
           S --- I --- I - . . . - I --- I ------ D
                                          \
                                           \     ...
                                            \
                                             ---- D

   Thus one has, N-M intermediate nodes i.e. nodes which donÆt
   terminate optical point-to-point connections. If each of these nodes
   is defined as OXC then the number of transceivers needed to setup M-

   1 unicast unidirectional connections from a specific source equals:
   ((N-M) x (M-1)) + (M-1) Transmitters and ((N-M) x (M-1)) + (M-1)
   Receivers, in total 2 x [((N-M) x (M-1)) + (Mû1)] Transceivers.
   However, if each of the intermediate nodes is defined as PXC then
   the number of transceivers needed to setup M-1 unicast
   unidirectional connections from a specific source equals: M-1
   Transmitter and M-1 Receivers, in total, 2 x (M-1) transceivers.

   More generically, we consider an optical network including N nodes
   and M source or destination nodes and an average network diameter d
   coverage for each lightpath. Then, the number of transceivers needed
   to setup M-1 unicast unidirectional connections from a specific
   source equals: d x (M-1) Transmitters and d x (M-1) Receivers, in
   total 2 x (d x (M-1)) Transceivers.

   Under the wavelength continuity constraint (i.e. in the absence of
   wavelength converters) within transparent optical networks, the
   routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) is the most challenging
   problem. The RWA problem can be formulated as follows: select the
   best combination of route and wavelength for each unicast connection
   such that the number of lightpaths established is maximized and such
   that two lightpaths sharing a common fiber link do not use the same
   wavelength. However, the routing and wavelength assignment problem
   for unicast connections in optical networks has been demonstrated in
   [4] to be NP-Complete. Therefore, heuristics have been developed in
   order to decrease the complexity level of the RWA problem.

3.2 Light-tree

   The concept of a light-tree has been introduced in [3] and
   explicitly refers to point-to-multipoint non-looping optical
   channels established in optical networks. A light-tree is formally
   defined as a directed Steiner tree [7] that is rooted at the source
   node and spans all the destination nodes. Each of the intermediate
   nodes of a light-tree provides optical multicast function i.e.
   requires optical signal power splitters.

   A light-tree enables an upstream node to have more than one logical
   downstream neighbor. This means that one source node can reach
   through a unique point-to-multipoint connection more than one
   downstream node considered as destination nodes. Consequently, the
   use of optical point-to-multipoint connections in all-optical
   networks reduces theoretically the number of transmitters compared
   to the number of receivers. In non-transparent this difference
   doesnÆt apply because the optical channel is terminated on each
   O/E/O interface (e.g. a link ôimpliesö one transmitter and one
   receiver). Therefore, for all-optical networks, one additional
   objective of optical multicast is to minimize the total number of
   transceivers (e.g. reduce the number transmitters compared to the
   number of receivers).

   Example:

   LetÆs consider an optical network including N nodes, M source or
   destination nodes and we assume that the N-M intermediate nodes
   include optical splitters. Thus one has, N-M intermediate nodes i.e.
   nodes which donÆt terminate optical point-to-multipoint connections.
   If each of these nodes is defined as OXC then the number of
   transceivers needed to setup one multicast (point-to-multipoint)
   connections from a specific source to M-1 destinations equals: ((N-
   M) + (M-1)) Transmitters and ((N-M) + (M-1)) Receivers, in total
   2(N-1) Transceivers. However, if each of the intermediate nodes is
   defined as PXC then the number of transceivers needed to setup this
   multicast connection equals: 1 Transmitter and M-1 Receivers, in
   total, M Transceivers.

   For instance, if N = 32 and M = 8, we need 62 transceivers for an
   OXCûbased non-transparent network and 8 Transceivers for a PXC-based
   all-optical network in order to setup a multicast tree from a
   specific source to 7 (M-1) destinations.

   Therefore, in all-optical multicast-capable networks, and per light-
   tree, the number of transmitters always equals 1 and the number of
   receivers always equals M-1 (i.e. the optimization of the total
   number of transceivers applies only to source and destination
   nodes). Moreover, and compared to the situation occurring in non-
   transparent networks, the minimization of the number of intermediate
   transceivers is directly transposable to the reduction of the number
   of PXC sub-interfaces.

   More generically, we consider an optical network including N nodes
   and M source or destination nodes and an average network diameter d
   coverage for each lightpath. If each of these nodes is defined as
   OXC, then the number of transceivers needed to setup one multicast
   (point-to-multipoint) connections from a specific source to M-1
   destinations equals: log(d) Transmitters and log(d) Receivers, in
   total 2 x log(d) Transceivers. This by assuming that the relation
   between the number of destinations (M-1) and the number of
   intermediate nodes covered by the corresponding tree is logarithmic.

   However, the routing problem in optical multicast-capable networks
   referred to as multicast-routing and wavelength assignment (MCRWA)
   problem is NP-Complete since it includes the RWA problem which is
   NP-Complete as demonstrated in [4]. In other words, the RWA problem
   is defined as a special case of the MCRWA problem. Therefore, one
   has to define and develop heuristics in order to decrease the MCRWA
   problem complexity. A complete formulation of the MCRWA problem can
   be found among other references in [8].

3.3 Light-tree Examples

   For the purpose of this memo, we propose to extend the multicast
   tree definition proposed in [3], by allowing light-trees to also
   cover shortest-path trees (i.e. non-Steiner trees).

   LetÆs take for instance the following optical multicast-capable
   network where each node has optical signal power splitting
   capability:

                              5                 1

                  H --------- I --------- J ----------


                 Fig.1 - Optical Multicast-capable Network


   LetÆs assume that the node A is defined as the root of the following
   light-tree (see Fig 2.) which covers every node. The members of the
   light-tree are equal cost nodes while an integer value is assigned
   to the link cost. The resulting light-tree has a minimized cost
   starting at node A reaching each of the leaf (or destination nodes)
   included in the topology.

   In this optical network topology, node D, for instance, ôexecutesö a
   form of ôdrop-and-continueö function since it terminates (i.e. drop)
   one of the output of the split signal and continues the other output
   of the split signal toward Node E. The same ôdrop-and-continueö
   operation applies at node B. In this latter case, the incoming
   signal is split at the output of node B and continued toward node C,
   F and H.

   If we consider only a subset of destination nodes, for instance D,
   E, G and J then we obtain the following light-tree which does not
   correspond to the shortest-path tree but to an optimized tree since
   signal splitting occurs at the more distant node (i.e. node D) from
   the root node A. Noticed that this optimized tree corresponds to the
   Steiner Tree.

        From A to G: Cost = 12
        From A to J: Cost = 12

        Steiner Tree Cost C(E) = 14

   If we had to compute the shortest-path tree for the same group of
   destination nodes {D, E, G, J} we would obtain the following tree:


                              5

   Therefore, the cost of the Shortest-Path Tree is higher than the one
   of the corresponding Steiner Tree. The former is thus referred to as
   a sub-optimal tree.

   Notice that the node and link cost minimization is only one among
   several of the possible constraints applicable to an optical
   multicast-capable network. If the jitter accumulation has to be
   minimized in a non-transparent optical-network, then a shortest-path
   tree computation can be used for that purpose.

   Consequently, it results from the application of the point-to-
   multipoint connections that the  ôlogical connectivityö of the
   optical network is increased with respect to the number of
   wavelengths used within the optical domain. Therefore, when using
   point-to-multipoint optical channels (or light-trees) we enable
   communication between a source (root) and a set of destination
   nodes. This in turn increases the overall network throughput.

4. Virtual Topologies

   As described in [5], virtual topology is an abstract concept used to
   describe a set of light-trees established on top of a specific
   physical network topology, which by definition is a fixed topology.
   Compared to the packet-oriented multicast connections established on
   top of this virtual topology, the changes experienced by the latter
   one are less frequent. Moreover, in [15], an efficient methodology
   has been described to achieve a new constraint based virtual
   topology (from the current virtual topology) by simultaneously
   minimizing the changes required to obtain the new virtual topology.
   However, the proposed technique is beyond the scope of this
   document.

   When considering the following example, the virtual topology can be
   defined as the set of point-to-multipoint connections (S, l, D)
   where S is the source node (here Node A and Node K), l is the
   multicasting wavelength and D is the set of destination nodes. Node
   A is multicasting on wavelength l1 and Node K is multicasting on
   wavelength l2. In this example, the sets of destinations nodes D are
   Nodes {C, F, H, J} and Nodes {B, D, E, G, I} respectively since
   wavelength L1 reaches Nodes {C, F, H, J} and wavelength l2 reaches
   Nodes {B, D, E, G, I}.

   Since a light-tree is a convenient generalization of a lightpath,
   the set of light-tree based virtual topologies is a superset of the
   set of lightpath based virtual topologies. Therefore, an ôoptimumö
   light-tree based virtual topology is guaranteed to have better
   performance than an ôoptimumö lightpath based virtual topology.

   Moreover, as mentioned above, the network resource optimization
   problem in optical multicast-capable networks includes both the
   minimization of the number of links (distance) on top of the
   physical network topology and the minimization of the total number
   of transceivers (and/or sub-interfaces) used in the optical network.

5. Optical Splitters and Virtual Topologies

5.1 Passive Optical Splitters

   In an optical multicast network, the splitter is the key hardware
   component. The optical splitter is a passive optical device, which
   enables the splitting of the input signal. A N-way splitter is
   defined as an optical device which equally splits the input signal
   among N outputs, thus reducing the power of each output to (1/N)
   times the original signal power (N value is called the splitting
   ratio). A large number of splitters require a large number of
   optical amplifiers to balance the optical power loss. A special case
   of a light splitter is a tap. A tap does not split equally the power
   of the input signal over the outgoing ports, it only taps a small
   amount of the signal power from the incoming signal and allows the
   signal to be continued with negligible power degradation. This memo
   is focused on optical multicast implemented through the use of
   optical splitters only.

   Consequently, an optical multicast-capable network will require a
   more detailed power budget computation since any optical power
   splitter introduces optical power loss. So, one of the major
   constraints when deploying an optical multicast network is to
   determine a design that reduces the total number of optical
   splitters allocated with minimal effects on network performance
   (i.e. keeping the network blocking probability low). Simultaneously,
   one has to reduce the impact on the power budget when multicast-tree
   topology changes while minimizing the total number of optical
   amplifiers used on each link. This means that either the power
   budget is over-provisioned i.e. any topology fits into the optical
   splitter allocation within the network or the power budget (in
   addition to the optical splitter availability constraint) decrease
   the number of potential virtual topologies.

   In the first case, the optical splitters allocation within the
   network give the capability to split the optical signal without any

   knowledge about the optical characteristics of that signal (BER, Q-
   Factor, etc.). When compared to packet-oriented multicast systems
   such as classical routers, the use of optical splitters allows
   optical networks to support multicasting without store-and-forward.

   As proposed in [8], a power-efficient design methodology is based on
   a two-dimensional design space:
   - The splitter-sharing dimension focused on minimizing the number of
     splitters inside the PXC itself.
   - The splitter-tap dimension focused on minimizing the number of
     multicastûcapable PXCÆs in the overall optical network taking into
     account the blocking probability.

   The optical splitter placement problem (or allocation problem) is
   also NP-complete (since it includes the RWA problem which is NP-
   complete). Notice that the most important result obtained in [9] is
   that for a wide variety of optical network topologies and different
   traffic patterns no more than 50% of the PXCÆs need to include
   optical power splitters. Having more than 50% of PXCÆs with
   multicast-capable hardware only slightly enhances the blocking
   performance of the optical network.

5.2 Active Optical Splitters

   Up to now, we have considered that optical splitter are passive
   components meaning if one wants to avoid blocking during multicast
   tree setup due to power budget constraints one has to over-provision
   the power budget. This implies that the power loss due to the
   optical signal splitting doesnÆt restrict the multicast tree virtual
   topologies and this independently of the launched power.

   In order to avoid such over-provisioning requirement, one has to
   consider active optical splitters or ôdynamic splittersö. An active
   optical splitter is defined as an N-way splitter which non-equally
   splits the input signal among N outputs, thus reducing the power of
   the output ônö to (1/k[n]) times the original signal power
   (Sum(1/k[n]) = 1). In this case, k[n], n = 1,..,n,..,N value is
   defined as the optical splitting ratio of the output ônö.

   The consequence of using such dynamic splitters is that one assume
   implicitly that multicast tree setup might be blocking for certain
   particular requests due to power budget constraints. However, in
   most cases, the dynamic optical power splitting ratio must allow
   allocating the exact output power in order to reach a given
   destination (a multicast tree leaf). This implies that nodes
   dynamically splitting the optical signal must be aware of the
   underlying optical routing impairments such as Optical SNR.

   Two alternatives must be considered when active optical splitters
   are deployed:
   - either the optical splitting ratio of each output is determined
     independently so that optical splitting ratio fine-tuning is only
     performed locally and so impacting the downstream nodes; for

draft-poj-optical-multicast-01.txt                           July 2001


     instance, the dynamic process is restricted to the node performing
     the last splitting before reaching the destination nodes (i.e.
     leaves)
   - or the optical splitting ratio of each output is recursively
     determined by a cascading of optical splitting ratio fine-tuning
     from the root node until the destination nodes or from the
     destination nodes to the root node; in this case optical splitting
     ration fine-tuning is not (necessarily) performed locally

   LetÆs consider the following optical network topology in order to
   illustrate both alternatives:


                  F                       G
                                          |
                                          |1

                              |1          |1
                              |           |     5
                  H           I           J xxxxxxxxx L


             Fig.6 - Dynamic Tuning of Optical Splitting Ratio

   The multicast tree having node A as root and {E, G, I, J} as set of
   destination nodes is considered as the initial tree configuration.
   In this situation node D performs equal ratio optical signal
   splitting since each of the downstream link has the same cost. Now,
   consider that Node L wants to join the set of leaf of this tree.
   Since the link joining node L to node J has a cost of 5, node J must
   now request more power in order to be able to locally drop the
   signal and continue it to fulfill the node L request.

   Therefore, since the input signal power reaching node J is
   determined by the optical splitting ratio of the node J output (at
   node D), node D has to change the power ratio it allocates towards
   node J. In such situation, if the input power P arriving at node D
   was higher than needed to reach simultaneously the initial set of
   destination nodes and if the difference between the additional power
   needed to reach additionally node L and the unused power is greater
   than zero then adding node L to the multicast tree can be performed
   at node D by allocating additional output power toward node J.

   If such conditions are not met, then depending on selection criteria
   like node cost, precedence, etc. either the request is rejected or
   node D initiates another input signal power change request toward
   node C. Another alternative would be to remove some of the leaves
   belonging to the initial set of destination nodes in order to
   recuperate the corresponding output signal power and allocate it to
   new request.

   Therefore, the generic procedure to dynamically determine the
   optical splitting ratio of the output ônö (i.e. k[n]) going from the
   leaf toward the root direction is defined as follows when a specific
   is joining a multicast tree of deep N:
   - Initial conditions,
        - The optical splitting ratio for a specific output ônö at
          level N-1 is defined by k[n,N-1];
        - At level N (leaf), the input power signal equals the output
          power signal (dropped signal)
   - When adding a leaf at level N+1 from output n
        - Apply the following recursive procedure until reaching a
          node enabling optical splitting ratio fine-tuning (e.g. for
          (i=N; i>0; i=i-1))
                - if input power signal k[n,i] doesnÆt enable to
                  continue the signal until then requestor node (leaf)
                  and if the level i is not equal to 0 (root level)
                - then initiate a optical splitting ratio change
                  request for k[n,i-1]
                - otherwise fine-tune the optical splitting ratio
                  k[n,i-1] and exit this recursive procedure

   As expected this procedure is rather straightforward and some
   constraints must be defined in order to reduce as much as possible
   the impact of an optical splitting ratio for a given output at a
   specific node. The most obvious is that when such change occurs, the
   m-1 other output should not be disturbed by such modification. This
   means that to some extend if one would like to achieve a dynamic
   optical multicast-capable network, launched power over-capacity is
   needed which can in turn request some additional attenuation device
   within the optical network.

   Notice, as well that this procedure must be reversible in order to
   enable the re-distribution of the optical power when a delete-branch
   request is initiated by receiver node. This allows the ôreturnö of
   the optical power in the upstream direction and so avoiding
   starvation of optical power in the middle of the multicast tree.

6. Optical Multicast-capable Networks

   Applications of optical multicast are straightforward: it will
   provide efficient dual-homing protection i.e. dedicated optical
   channel (and/or optical line) dedicated protection. Such protection
   scheme can be applied to deploy efficient (all-)optical rings
   survivability mechanisms. Optical multicast would in turn allow
   defining so-called sub-network connection protection between optical
   signal splitter capable devices.

   To illustrate this mechanism which is not restricted to optical ring
   topologies, letÆs consider the example given in Section 3.

   If node B and node D have optical signal splitting capabilities,
   then the following scenario can be considered. One needs to
   establish a protected connection between source node A and
   destination node E knowing that:
   - C is defined with a high failure probability (or all resources on
     this node have been already allocated) so that one must exclude
     node C for such connection service request
   - Alternate paths through nodes F and G as well as through nodes H,
     I and J have enough free resources to accommodate such request

   Consequently, one could have the following primary (working) and
   secondary (protection) segments established between nodes B and D:

   Where the path [A, B, F, G, D, E] is defined as the primary while
   [A, B, H, I, J D, E] is defined as the secondary optical channel.
   Notice that due to the signal splitting at node B, node D receives
   both primary and protection signals and selects the primary one.
   Therefore, when a failure occur at one of the network resources
   allocated to the primary segment [B, F, G, D] switching to the
   protection segment [B, H, I, J, D] is straightforward.

   Moreover, the application of the optical multicast concept will also
   facilitate the implementation of the Drop-and-Continue functionality

   between optical rings as described in [10]. Other applications of
   optical multicast are focused on æclassicalÆ multicast applications
   such as HDTV, Video, etc.

   However, as described in [11], the scheduling of multicast traffic
   in an optical multicast-capable network needs to take into account
   two conflicting objectives: low bandwidth utilization at the packet-
   layer and high optical channel capacity utilization. Moreover, as
   stated in [12] more practical traffic patterns and real network
   scenarios must be considered, since in optical network topologies
   both unicast and multicast traffic will be simultaneously present
   within the same optical network.

   Taking into account these considerations is key to a successful
   development and deployment of optical multicast-capable networks.

7. Signalling in Optical Multicast-capable Networks

   It is widely accepted that point-to-multipoint applications such as
   HDTV and Video Streams will comprise a large portion of the
   multicast application space. The proposed signalling model is
   designed to efficiently handle such cases where sources are well
   known. This is specifically the case with optical multicast were the
   sources S are in most cases well defined (location, address, etc.)

   Signalling in optical multicast-capable networks is realized through
   GMPLS signalling as described in [GMPLS-SIG]. Since an optical
   multicast tree is unidirectional, the suggested label mechanism
   defined for bi-directional LSP setup is not applicable here.

   In this section, a node is independently referred (at the signalling
   plane level) to as a PXC or an OXC or using the GMPLS terminology
   [18] as an LSR. A lightpath is referred here to as a Lambda-LSP (L-
   LSP) or simply an LSP.

7.1 Optical Network Architecture

   The Optical Cross-Connect (OXC) system architecture for lambda
   switching has been introduced in the [16] and [17]. The OXC
   interfaces considered includes, as described in [18], Lambda Switch
   Capable (LSC) interfaces that switches the lightpath segment based
   on the incoming wavelength and Fiber-Switch Capable (FSC) interfaces
   that switches the lightpath based on the spatial position of the
   incoming data stream in the physical space.

   An OXC has several incoming and outgoing LSC interfaces or ports,
   connected to adjacent OXCÆs, and several incoming and outgoing LSC
   interfaces or ports attached to an edge device that can be a router
   (or any other kind of device supporting termination capable
   interfaces). An OXC includes mainly two functional parts: an OXC
   Switch Controller (OSCtrl) and OXC optical matrix.

   The OSCtrl communicates through Optical Supervisory Channels (OSC)
   i.e. out-of-band signalling transport mechanism or through dedicated

   matrix. The commands to control the OXC optical matrix are as
   follows: connect (and disconnect) between an incoming LSC interface
   and an outgoing LSC interface. The OSCtrl is also capable to process
   status requests, lightpath modification requests as well as
   notification messages. The same commands apply when the OXC is
   connected to an LSC capable edge device.

   Based on these commands, a chain of connections through OXCs can
   form a point-to-point optical channel i.e. a lightpath (as described
   in section 3.1). The ingress OXC is the node where the multicast
   tree starts (sender), the egress OXC(s) are the destination nodes
   (receivers) and the OXCs in the middle of the tree are referred to
   as intermediate OXCs.

   An OXC optical matrix receives commands from the OSCtrl, and replies
   whether the command was successful or not. The OSCtrl then converts

   the result into a message that it sends via the OSC channel
   throughout the signalling plane of the optical network.

   To cover any kind of optical network, we consider as specified in
   [16] the following distinction between Optical Cross-Connect (OXC)
   in non-transparent optical networks and Photonic Cross-Connect (PXC)
   in all-optical networks. Basically, OXC devices included within non-
   transparent optical networks performs O/E/O conversion at each of
   their interfaces while PXC devices included within optical networks
   do not perform O/E/O conversion at all so they are defined as pure
   O-O devices (including tunable lasers). We consider here that all
   the interfaces of an OXC as well as all the interfaces of a PXC are
   Lambda Switching Capable (LSC) interfaces. Moreover, in order to
   enable optical multicast functionality, OXCs and PXCs must include
   optical splitters contained into splitter banks.

   In the remaining parts of this document, nodes are considered as
   optical PXC but these considerations can also be applied to OXC.

7.2 Shortest-Path Trees

   Typically in packet-networks, multicast routing protocols create
   shortest-path trees.  These trees are non-optimal (as described in
   section 5), but the algorithm is distributed and allows the dynamic
   adding and removal of the multicast tree branches without affecting
   the existing tree. The mapping of these trees onto LSPs is discussed
   for Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) in
   [19] and more specifically in [20]. The PIM-SM protocol is used in
   two multicast models: Any-Source Multicast (ASM) and Source-Specific
   Multicast (SSM). Therefore, one refers to the models as PIM-SM for
   ASM and PIM-SM for SSM, respectively.

   PIM Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) is defined as receiver initiated
   approaches. One of the key issues with this approach is the merging
   of user signalling-plane with the optical signalling-plane when
   considering a unified service model between the edge router and the
   optical domain.

7.2.1 Source/Share Multicast Trees

   In classical packet multicast [19], IP multicast routing protocols
   create either source trees (S, G), i.e. a tree per source (S) and
   per multicast group (G), or shared trees (*, G), i.e. one tree per
   multicast group (Figure 1).

                     Fig.10 - Shared and Source Trees

   In packet-based multicast-capable networks, the advantage of using
   shared trees, when label switching is applied, is that shared trees
   consume less labels than source trees (1 label per group versus 1
   label per source and per group).

7.2.2 PIM-SM for ASM

   PIM Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) enables to construct unidirectional shared
   or source trees (see Fig.10) to forward data from senders to
   receivers of a multicast group. Moreover in [20], PIM-SM (PIMv1 and
   PIMv2) has been extended to combine MPLS label distribution with the
   distribution of (*,G) join state, (S,G) join state, or (S,G) RPT-bit
   prune state. Note that (*,G) join state implications need to be
   evaluated in optical multicast because the elimination of the shared
   tree concept is the key to implement SSM. This because SSM
   eliminates the need for starting with a shared tree and then
   switching to a source-specific tree (see section 7.2.3).

   In PIM-SM MPLS extension, labels and multicast routes are sent
   together in one message. Therefore, we propose here to extend this
   method for optical multicast-capable networks. We will refer to this
   method as Optical PIM-SM.

   The design described in [20], specifies that Multicast label
   distribution procedures should not depend on the media type. Note
   also that when a multicast routing table change requires a label
   distribution change, the latency between the two should be
   minimized, both to improve performance and to minimize the
   possibility of race conditions.

   On receiving PIM Join/Prune messages from an edge router, a PXC that
   supports optical multicast (i.e. that includes optical splitters)
   sends PIM Join/Prune messages to upstream neighboring PXCs toward
   the Rendezvous Point (RP) for the shared-tree (*,G) or toward a
   source for a source-tree (S,G). Wavelength Labels, described in
   [18], are distributed by being associated with IPv4 multicast
   addresses (address issue is considered in section 7.2.3) in the join
   list or the prune list. As described in [19], the multicast tree
   setup is performed using downstream label distribution with
   independent LSP control so that requesting nodes can join
   independently the multicast tree.

   Router R and PXCs are included in the same signalling plane i.e. the
   mechanism described here applies to a unified service model [18]. So
   that the generalization of the mechanism defined in packet
   multicast-capable networks to the optical multicast-capable networks
   need to be considered as described in [22].

7.2.3 PIM-SM for SSM

   Source Specific Multicast (SSM) defines a method of multicast
   forwarding restricted to shortest path trees to specific sources.

   The key difference between ASM and SSM is that the latter eliminates
   the need for starting with a (*,G) shared tree and then switching to
   a source-specific tree. More precisely, when a LSR (for instance, a
   boundary PXC) identifies request to join a specific source with a
   SSM group address (232/8), it always initiates a (S,G) join and
   never a (*,G) join.

   SSM enables that a single source S can transmit to a channel (S,G)
   where G is an SSM address. Each receiver is capable of specifying
   the specific sources from which it would like to receive content.
   This would in turn enable a direct mapping of SSM to optical
   multicast.

7.2.4 PIM-SM: ASM versus SSM

draft-poj-optical-multicast-01.txt                           July 2001


   As discussed in the previous sections, shared trees (*,G) join state
   are only used to discover new sources of the group and after a
   switchover to a source tree is performed.

   However, the end-to-end mapping of a (*,G) shared tree implies the
   setup of multipoint-to-multipoint trees (i.e. light-trees). The
   problem is that in the optical domain, labels represent wavelengths,
   which are by definition non-mergeable. Consequently, optical
   multipoint-to-multipoint light-trees are not applicable in optical
   multicast since label merging is not feasible.

   Since the difference between ASM and SSM is that the latter
   eliminates the need for starting with a (*,G) shared tree and then
   switching to a source-specific tree, this restricts the choice to
   SSM for shortest-path tree receiver initiated approach.

7.3 Non-Shortest-Path Trees

   The shortest-path tree approach could be taken for optical multicast
   but there are several reasons to consider another means:
   - The diversity of the nodes in optical networks: PXCs without and
     with support for multicast, the latter can be Splitter and
     Delivery (SaDs) or Multicast optical SaDs (MoSads) [8]
   - The multicast light-trees tend to be more stable (branches added
     and removed sporadically)
   - Shortest-path trees are not optimal (as described previously)
   - Internal PXCs might not be aware of global routing information
     (when using an overlay signalling plane), so a PXC wonÆt be able
     to determine where to send a PIM Join if the source S is outside
     of the optical domain
   - MCRWA constraints (see section 4)

   Because of the above reasons, it might be useful to consider a non-
   shortest-path tree approach combined with an offline traffic-
   engineering tool. The offline tool performs the multicast tree route
   computation by taking into account the variety of constraints set by
   optical networks. The offline tool computation can provide a more
   optimal multicast tree than the shortest-path tree one. Many
   heuristics exist to approximate e.g. the optimal Steiner Tree [18].

   To establish the calculated tree in the network one can use a
   management interface (e.g. SNMP) to every on-tree PXC or one can
   introduce the use of GMPLS signalling protocol [GMPLS-SIG]. The
   latter can be downstream or upstream signalling. So that the non-
   Shortest-Path trees could be either root or receiver initiated.

7.3.1 Root Initiated

   The explicit routing signalling is based on the computation of the
   explicit multicast route from the root to each of the (intermediate)
   destination nodes.

   In the root-initiated case, the signalling flows from root to
   destinations. This approach requires that a multicast tree route
   object [19] is signaled. For instance, if we refer to the previous
   example:

                  F                       G
                                          |

                     Fig.12 û Root Initiated Approach


   The explicit multicast tree route that the node A (or the offline
   tool) has computed can be represented as: A [B [C [D [(G, J)]]]]

   More precisely, as defined in [20], each of the link bundles of a
   PXC (i.e. PXC-LSR) can be numbered (by an IPv4 address) or
   unnumbered (by a Node ID and a Link bundle index). So that the
   identification of the hops included in the explicit multicast tree
   route can be expressed by using this addressing scheme.

   Therefore, multicast explicit route can be included within the
   Explicit Route TLV (ER-TLV) described in [21]. The content of an ER-
   TLV is defined as a series of variable length ER-Hop TLVs. We
   consider here ER-Hop Type being IPv4 prefix. The IPv4 prefix
   represents the IP address of the link bundle of each node through
   which the multicast tree need to be established. The L bit defines
   whether the value of the attribute is loose. In this case, the value
   of the attribute is strict so that the L bit is not set.

   Then the root of the multicast tree sends a Label Request message
   along with the explicit tree TLV. The subsequent PXC-LSR looks up
   its downstream PXC-LSR in the explicit tree object of the label
   request message. Then it sends the Label Request message to these
   downstream routers. After the PXC-LSR receives the Label Mapping
   messages from the downstream PXC-LSR, it allocates a label itself,
   installs this point-to-multipoint forwarding entry into the
   forwarding table and sends a Label Mapping message to its upstream
   PXC-LSR.

   This tree can be torn down by the Label Release messages sent from
   the root to all the leaves. When a node receives a Label Release
   message, it takes the MPLS forwarding entry out of the forwarding
   table, and sends a Label Release message to every downstream PXC-
   LSR.

   For an edge router to become a member of a particular optical
   multicast group, the router has to register multicast group
   membership with a specific query to the PXC that handles the
   multicast group membership. Protocol like IGMP could be used for
   that purpose. To construct a distribution tree connecting all the
   edge routers, multicast-capable PXC-LSRs then exchange messages with
   each other by using Multicast Traffic-Engineering extension to IGP
   routing protocols. Details concerning these multicast traffic-
   engineering extensions are left for further study.

7.3.2 Receiver Initiated

   Alternatively the signalling can start at the receiver side [20].
   The signalling starting at a receiver is sent in the direction of
   the root along an explicit path. In this case, the (wavelength)
   label distribution mode is a downstream-on-demand distribution and
   the LSP control is ordered. However, the signalling goes in the
   upstream direction from the destination node (receiver) to the
   source node (sender).

   The Downstream on Demand procedures applies to multicast
   distribution trees. Independent LSP control is needed so that

   different downstream branches of a multicast distribution tree can
   join the tree independently.

   When using the receiver initiated approach, the multicast-tree is
   built from the leaves to the root. In this case, either the tree can
   be centrally calculated by an offline tool (and the reverse path of
   the root to each leaf is sent to the leaf) or the reverse path from
   the leaf to root can also be calculated by the leaf of the tree,
   based on e.g. Multicast TE-Routing information. Note that in former
   case, the pruning of one leaf and the subsequent new tree
   calculation by the offline tool can affect other branches than the
   one of the removed leaf.

   Each leaf node sends a Join message (note that this is not a
   multicast routing Join message, but an extension to an MPLS
   signalling protocol as defined in [26]) with the explicit reverse
   path and a label towards the root. At the subsequent upstream PXC-
   LSR, the Join messages of the same tree are merged, a label is
   allocated, the point-to-multipoint forwarding entry is installed
   into the forwarding table, and a Join with the newly allocated label
   and the explicit reverse path object is sent to the upstream PXC-
   LSR. Notice, that this approach encompass both (S,G) and (*,G) Join
   messages, however as stated in Section 7.2, only (S,G) Join messages
   will be used to setup optical multicast trees.

   When a Join message reaches an on-tree PXC-LSR, it processes the
   message, modifies the forwarding entry with the label assigned by
   the newly joined downstream PXC-LSR and finishes the join procedure.

   When a leaf node wants to leave the group, it sends a Label Withdraw
   to its upstream router. When all the downstream neighbors of a PXC-
   LSR leave the group, it should send a Label Withdraw to its upstream
   neighbor.

7.3.4 Additional Considerations

   After calculating the multicast tree, the offline tool can decide to
   already assign the wavelength for every link on every branch.
   Alternatively, it can leave it up to the individual PXCs and send
   the explicit multicast route to the source node and setup the
   corresponding light-tree through GMPLS signalling.

   In packet networks unicast and multicast have their own separate
   label spaces, this is no longer true for optical networks since
   wavelengths are physical, non-shareable and non-mergeable entities.
   If the PXCs perform the label allocation it would be advisable to
   define an allocation mechanism (downstream, downstream-on-demand,
   etc.) that is similar to the one used for unicast traffic. This in
   order to avoid simultaneous allocation of the same wavelength by the
   upstream and the downstream PXC.

7.4 User-plane Signalling

   Up to now, we donÆt address one of the key issues with optical
   multicast: the merging of user signalling-plane with the optical
   signalling-plane when considering a unified service model between
   the edge router and the optical domain.

   By applying one of the approaches defined in the previous sections,
   we obtain an optical light-tree (which by definition is strictly
   unidirectional) defined at the transport-plane level from the source
   S to the destination. So that a single source router (root) can
   reach simultaneously several destinations belonging to the same
   multicast group. However, this document does not describe a
   mechanism allowing specific destinations to reach a source router at
   the packet LSP level (i.e. at the user-plane level) since these
   considerations are out of the scope of this document.

   If the same administrative authority manages both the edge routers
   and the optical network, then a peer relationship between the PIM
   instance of the optical network and the client network can be
   defined as depicted in the following figure:

   Otherwise, if the edge routers and the optical network belong to
   distinct administrative authorities, then a mapping between PIM
   instances need to be defined (see Figure 14).

   Needless to say that such considerations need further developments
   which are clearly outside of the scope of this document.
