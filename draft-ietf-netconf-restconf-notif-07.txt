1.  Introduction

   Mechanisms to support event subscription and push are defined in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications].  Enhancements to
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] which enable YANG
   datastore subscription and push are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push].  This document provides a transport
   specification for dynamic subscriptions over RESTCONF [RFC8040].
   Driving these requirements is [RFC7923].

   The streaming of notifications encapsulating the resulting
   information push can be done with either HTTP1.1 [RFC7231] or HTTP2
   [RFC7540].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The following terms use the definitions from
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications]: dynamic
   subscription, event stream, notification message, publisher,
   receiver, subscriber, and subscription.

   Other terms reused include datastore, which is defined in [RFC8342],
   and HTTP2 stream which maps to the definition of "stream" within
   [RFC7540], Section 2.

   [ note to the RFC Editor - please replace XXXX within this document
   with the number of this document ]

3.  Dynamic Subscriptions

   This section provides specifics on how to establish and maintain
   dynamic subscriptions over HTTP 1.1 and HTTP2 via signaling messages
   transported over RESTCONF [RFC8040].  Subscribing to event streams is
   accomplished in this way via a RESTCONF POST into RPCs defined within
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] Section 2.4.  YANG
   datastore subscription is accomplished via augmentations to
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] as described within
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push] Section 4.4.

   Common across all HTTP based dynamic subscriptions is that a POST
   needs to be made against a specific URI on the Publisher.
   Subscribers cannot pre-determine the URI against which a subscription
   might exist on a publisher, as the URI will only exist after the
   "establish-subscription" has been accepted.  The subscription URI
   will be determined and sent as part of the response to the
   "establish-subscription", and a subsequent POST to this URI will be
   done in order to start the flow of notification messages back to the
   subscriber.  A subscription does not move to the active state as per
   Section 2.4.1. of [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications]
   until the POST is received.

3.1.  Transport Connectivity

   For a dynamic subscription, where an HTTP client session doesn't
   already exist, a new client session is initiated from the subscriber.
   If the subscriber is unsure if HTTP2 is supported by the publisher,
   HTTP1.1 will be used for initial messages, and these messages will
   include an HTTP version upgrade request as per [RFC7230],
   Section 6.7.  If a publisher response indicates that HTTP2 is
   supported, HTTP2 will be used between subscriber and publisher for
   future HTTP interactions as per [RFC7540].

   A subscriber SHOULD establish the HTTP session over TLS [RFC5246] in
   order to secure the content in transit.

   Without the involvement of additional protocols, neither HTTP1.1 nor
   HTTP2 sessions by themselves allow for a quick recognition of when
   the communication path has been lost with the publisher.  Where quick
   recognition of the loss of a publisher is required, a subscriber
   SHOULD connect over TLS [RFC5246], and use a TLS heartbeat [RFC6520]
   to track HTTP session continuity.  In the case where a TLS heartbeat
   is included, it should be sent just from receiver to publisher.  Loss
   of the heartbeat MUST result in any subscription related TCP sessions
   between those endpoints being torn down.  A subscriber can then
   attempt to re-establish.

3.2.  Discovery

   Subscribers can learn what event streams a RESTCONF server supports
   by querying the "streams" container of ietf-subscribed-
   notification.yang.  Subscribers can learn what datastores a RESTCONF
   server supports by following [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-nmda-restconf].

3.3.  RESTCONF RPCs and HTTP Status Codes

   Specific HTTP responses codes as defined in [RFC7231] section 6 will
   indicate the result of RESTCONF RPC requests with publisher.  An HTTP
   status code of 200 is the proper response to any successful RPC
   defined within [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] or
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push].

   If a publisher fails to serve the RPC request for one of the reasons
   indicated in [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications]
   Section 2.4.6 or [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push] Appendix A, this will
   be indicated by "406" status code transported in the HTTP response.

   When a "406" status code is returned, the RPC reply MUST include an
   "rpc-error" element per [RFC8040] Section 7.1 with the following
   parameter values:

   o  an "error-type" node of "application".

   o  an "error-tag" node of "operation-failed".

   o  an "error-app-tag" node with the value being a string that
      corresponds to an identity associated with the error, as defined
      in [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] section 2.4.6
      for general subscriptions, and [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push]
      Appendix A.1, for datastore subscriptions.  The tag to use depends
      on the RPC for which the error occurred.  Viable errors for
      different RPCs are as follows:

            RPC                     select an identity with a base
            ----------------------  ------------------------------
            establish-subscription  establish-subscription-error
            modify-subscription     modify-subscription-error
            delete-subscription     delete-subscription-error
            kill-subscription       kill-subscription-error
            resynch-subscription    resynch-subscription-error

   Each error identity will be inserted as the "error-app-tag" using
   JSON encoding following the form <modulename>:<identityname>.  An
   example of such as valid encoding would be "ietf-subscribed-
   notifications:no-such-subscription".

   o  In case of error responses to an "establish-subscription" or
      "modify-subscription" request there is the option of including an
      "error-info" node.  This node may contain hints for parameter
      settings that might lead to successful RPC requests in the future.
      Following are the yang-data structures which may be returned:

Internet-Draft               RESTCONF-Notif               September 2018


      establish-subscription returns hints in yang-data structure
      ---------------------- ------------------------------------
      target: event stream   establish-subscription-stream-error-info
      target: datastore      establish-subscription-datastore-error-info

      modify-subscription    returns hints in yang-data structure
      ---------------------- ------------------------------------
      target: event stream   modify-subscription-stream-error-info
      target: datastore      modify-subscription-datastore-error-info

      The yang-data included within "error-info" SHOULD NOT include the
      optional leaf "error-reason", as such a leaf would be redundant
      with information that is already placed within the
      "error-app-tag".

      In case of an rpc error as a result of a "delete-subscription", a
      "kill-subscription", or a "resynch-subscription" request, no
      "error-info" needs to be included, as the "subscription-id" is
      the only RPC input parameter and no hints regarding this RPC input
      parameters need to be provided.

   Note that "error-path" does not need to be included with the "rpc-
   error" element, as subscription errors are generally not associated
   with nodes in the datastore but with the choice of RPC input
   parameters.

3.4.  Call Flow for HTTP2

   Requests to [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] or
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push] augmented RPCs are sent on one or more
   HTTP2 streams indicated by (a) in Figure 1.  A successful "establish-
   subscription" will result in an RPC response returned with both a
   subscription identifier which uniquely identifies a subscription, as
   well as a URI which uniquely identifies the location of subscription
   on the publisher.  This URI is defined via the "uri" leaf the Data
   Model in Section 8.

   An HTTP POST is then sent on a logically separate HTTP2 stream (b) to
   the URI on the publisher.  This initiates to initiate the flow of
   notification messages which are sent in HTTP Data frames as a
   response to the POST.  In the case below, a newly established
   subscription has its associated notification messages pushed over
   HTTP2 stream (7).  These notification messages are placed into a
   HTTP2 Data frame (see [RFC7540] Section 6.1).

                       Figure 1: Dynamic with HTTP2

   Additional requirements for dynamic subscriptions over HTTP2 include:

   o  A unique HTTP2 stream MAY be used for each subscription.

   o  A single HTTP2 stream MUST NOT be used for subscriptions with
      different DSCP values.

   o  All subscription state notifications from a publisher MUST be
      returned in a separate HTTP Data frame within the HTTP2 stream
      used by the subscription to which the state change refers.

   o  In addition to an RPC response for a "modify-subscription" RPC
      traveling over (a), a "subscription-modified" state change
      notification must be sent within HTTP2 stream (b).  This allows
      the receiver to know exactly when the new terms of the

      subscription have been applied to the notification messages.  See
      arrow (c).

   o  Additional RPCs for a particular subscription MUST NOT use the
      HTTP2 stream currently providing notification messages
      subscriptions.

   o  An HTTP end of stream message MUST not be sent until all
      subscriptions using that HTTP2 stream have completed.

3.5.  Call flow for HTTP1.1

   The call flow is defined in Figure 2.  Requests to
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] or
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push] augmented RPCs are sent on a TCP
   connection indicated by (a).  A successful "establish-subscription"
   will result in an RPC response returned with both a subscription
   identifier which uniquely identifies a subscription, as well as a URI
   which uniquely identifies the location of subscription on the
   publisher (b).  This URI is defined via the "uri" leaf the Data Model
   in Section 8.

   An HTTP POST is then sent on a logically separate TCP connection (b)
   to the URI on the publisher.  This initiates to initiate the flow of
   notification messages which are sent in SSE [W3C-20150203] as a
   response to the POST.

   Additional requirements for dynamic subscriptions over HTTP1.1
   include:

   o  All subscription state notifications from a publisher MUST be
      returned in a separate SSE message used by the subscription to
      which the state change refers.

   o  Subscription RPCs MUST NOT use the TCP connection currently
      providing notification messages for that subscription.

   o  In addition to an RPC response for a "modify-subscription" RPC
      traveling over (a), a "subscription-modified" state change
      notification must be sent within stream (b).  This allows the
      receiver to know exactly when the new terms of the subscription
      have been applied to the notification messages.  See arrow (c).

   Open question, should we just eliminate this possibility of HTTP1.1
   for subscriptions?  It would make the design simpler.

4.  QoS Treatment

   To meet subscription quality of service promises, the publisher MUST
   take any existing subscription "dscp" and apply it to the DSCP
   marking in the IP header.

   In addition, where HTTP2 transport is available to a notification
   message queued for transport to a receiver, the publisher MUST:

   o  take any existing subscription "priority" and copy it into the
      HTTP2 stream priority, and

   o  take any existing subscription "dependency" and map the HTTP2
      stream for the parent subscription into the HTTP2 stream
      dependency.

5.  Mandatory JSON and datastore support

   A publisher supporting [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push] MUST support the
   "operational" datastore as defined by [RFC8342].

   The "encode-json" feature of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] is mandatory to
   support.  This indicates that JSON is a valid encoding for RPCs,
   state change notifications, and subscribed content.

6.  Notification Messages

   Notification messages transported over HTTP will be encoded using
   one-way operation schema defined within [RFC5277], section 4.

7.  YANG Tree

   The YANG model defined in Section 8 has one leaf augmented into four
   places of [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications], plus two
   identities.  As the resulting full tree is large, it will only be
   inserted at later stages of this document.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the following namespace URI in the "IETF XML
   Registry" [RFC3688]:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-restconf-subscribed-
   notifications
   Registrant Contact: The IESG.
   XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers the following YANG module in the "YANG Module
   Names" registry [RFC6020]:

   Name: ietf-restconf-subscribed-notifications
   Namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-restconf-subscribed-
   notifications
   Prefix: rsn
   Reference: RFC XXXX: RESTCONF Transport for Event Notifications

10.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management transports
   such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF
   layer is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement
   secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest
   RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is TLS [RFC5246].

   The one new data node introduced in this YANG module may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It
   is thus important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config,
   or notification) to this data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   Container: "/subscriptions"

   o  "uri": leaf will show where subscribed resources might be located
      on a publisher.  Access control must be set so that only someone
      with proper access permissions, and perhaps even HTTP session has
      the ability to access this resource.

            Figure 3: Multiple subscriptions over RESTCONF/HTTP

   To provide examples of the information being transported, example
   messages for interactions in Figure 3 are detailed below:

   POST /restconf/operations/subscriptions:establish-subscription

   {
      "ietf-subscribed-notifications:input": {
         "stream": "NETCONF",
         "stream-xpath-filter": "/ex:foo/",
         "dscp": "10"
      }
   }

               Figure 4: establish-subscription request (a)

   As publisher was able to fully satisfy the request, the publisher
   sends the subscription identifier of the accepted subscription, and
   the URI:

   HTTP status code - 200

   {
      "id": "22",
      "uri": "/subscriptions/22"
   }


               Figure 5: establish-subscription success (b)

   Upon receipt of the successful response, the subscriber POSTs to the
   provided URI to start the flow of notification messages.  When the
   publisher receives this, the subscription is moved to the active
   state (c).

   POST /restconf/operations/subscriptions/22


             Figure 6: establish-subscription subsequent POST

   While not shown in Figure 3, if the publisher had not been able to
   fully satisfy the request, or subscriber has no authorization to
   establish the subscription, the publisher would have sent an RPC
   error response.  For instance, if the "dscp" value of 10 asserted by
   the subscriber in Figure 4 proved unacceptable, the publisher may
   have returned:

         HTTP status code - 406

         { "ietf-restconf:errors" : {
             "error" : [
               {
                 "error-type": "application",
                 "error-tag": "operation-failed",
                 "error-severity": "error",
                 "error-app-tag":
                     "ietf-subscribed-notifications:dscp-unavailable"
               }
             ]
           }
         }


             Figure 7: an unsuccessful establish subscription

   The subscriber can use this information in future attempts to
   establish a subscription.

A.1.2.  Modifying Dynamic Subscriptions

   An existing subscription may be modified.  The following exchange
   shows a negotiation of such a modification via several exchanges
   between a subscriber and a publisher.  This negotiation consists of a
   failed RPC modification request/response, followed by a successful
   one.

   Figure 8: Interaction model for successful subscription modification

   If the subscription being modified in Figure 8 is a datastore
   subscription as per [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push], the modification
   request made in (d) may look like that shown in Figure 9.  As can be
   seen, the modifications being attempted are the application of a new
   xpath filter as well as the setting of a new periodic time interval.

              Figure 9: Subscription modification request (c)

   If the publisher can satisfy both changes, the publisher sends a
   positive result for the RPC.  If the publisher cannot satisfy either
   of the proposed changes, the publisher sends an RPC error response
   (e).  The following is an example RPC error response for (e) which
   includes a hint.  This hint is an alternative time period value which
   might have resulted in a successful modification:

         HTTP status code - 406

         { "ietf-restconf:errors" : {
             "error" : [
               "error-type": "application",
               "error-tag": "operation-failed",
               "error-severity": "error",
               "error-app-tag": "ietf-yang-push:period-unsupported",
               "error-info": {
                 "ietf-yang-push":

A.1.3.  Deleting Dynamic Subscriptions

   The following demonstrates deleting a subscription.  This
   subscription may have been to either a stream or a datastore.

    }
   }

                      Figure 11: Delete subscription

   If the publisher can satisfy the request, the publisher replies with
   success to the RPC request.

   If the publisher cannot satisfy the request, the publisher sends an
   error-rpc element indicating the modification didn't work.  Figure 12
   shows a valid response for existing valid subscription identifier,
   but that subscription identifier was created on a different transport
   session:

         HTTP status code - 406

         {
           "ietf-restconf:errors" : {
             "error" : [
               "error-type": "application",
               "error-tag": "operation-failed",
               "error-severity": "error",
               "error-app-tag":
                  "ietf-subscribed-notifications:no-such-subscription"
             ]

A.2.  Subscription State Notifications

   A publisher will send subscription state notifications according to
   the definitions within
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications]).

A.2.1.  subscription-started and subscription-modified

   A "subscription-started" encoded in JSON would look like:

         "id": "39",
         "transport": "HTTP2",
         "stream-xpath-filter": "/ex:foo",
         "stream": {
            "ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications" : "NETCONF"
         }
       }
     }
   }

      Figure 13: subscription-started subscription state notification

   The "subscription-modified" is identical to Figure 13, with just the
   word "started" being replaced by "modified".

A.2.2.  subscription-completed, subscription-resumed, and replay-
        complete

   A "subscription-completed" would look like:


   {
     "ietf-restconf:notification" : {
       "eventTime": "2007-09-01T10:00:00Z",
       "ietf-subscribed-notifications:subscription-completed": {
         "id": "39",
       }
     }
   }

          Figure 14: subscription-completed notification in JSON

   The "subscription-resumed" and "replay-complete" are virtually
   identical, with "subscription-completed" simply being replaced by
   "subscription-resumed" and "replay-complete".

A.2.3.  subscription-terminated and subscription-suspended

   A "subscription-terminated" would look like:

         "error-id": "suspension-timeout"
       }
     }
   }

    Figure 15: subscription-terminated subscription state notification

   The "subscription-suspended" is virtually identical, with
   "subscription-terminated" simply being replaced by "subscription-
   suspended".
