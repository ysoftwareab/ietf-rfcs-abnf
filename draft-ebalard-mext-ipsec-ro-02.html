<h1><br />Mobile IPv6 IPsec Route Optimization (IRO)<br />draft-ebalard-mext-ipsec-ro-02</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p> This memo specifies an improved alternate route optimization
     procedure for Mobile IPv6 designed specifically for environments
     where IPsec is used between peers (most probably with IKE). The
     replacement of the complex Return Routability procedure for a
     simple mechanism and the removal of HAO and RH2 extensions from
     exchanged packets result in performance and security
     improvements.
</p>

	  IPsec for protection of communications (control and
	  optionally data) between a Mobile Node and its Home
	  Agent. Support for static keying is made mandatory, and
	  dynamic keying optional. The protection is made possible by
	  the trust relationship that preexists between the HA and the
	  MN: they belong to a common trust domain (the same network,
	  a PKI). 
</p>
<p> Interactions between MIPv6 and IPsec/IKE for MN and

Characteristics of IRO</h3>

<p> This document defines an extension of Mobile IPv6 protocol
	  that aims at replacing common RRP and RO procedures by a
	  mechanism called IPsec Route Optimization (IRO) in
	  environments where IPsec and IKE are used. 
</p>
<p> It allows MN to mount and maintain direct IPsec-protected
	  communications with CN and other MN with which they share
	  some trust relationship, in a completely transparent fashion
	  for upper layer protocols. 
</p>
<p> IRO is not a detailed set of requirements for IPsec to
	  work between MN and CN but a new mechanism resulting from
	  the tight integration and joint efforts of MIPv6, IKE and
	  IPsec to provide a secure and scalable mobility
	  service. 
</p>
<p> The main functional and security advantages that best
	  describe IRO are:<br />
<br />


	  </p>
<ul class="text">
<li> Protected MN-CN binding using IKE-negotiated IPsec
	      SAs. 
</li>
<li> Complete transparency for IKE (negotiation, rekeying,
	      movement, ...) and other upper layers, including layer
	      14 (the user). 
</li>
<li> Compatibility with both tunnel and transport mode
	      IPsec protection between peers.
</li>
<li> Compatibility with static keying (See <a class='info' href='#app.statickeying'>Appendix&nbsp;G<span> (</span><span class='info'>Compatibility with static keying</span><span>)</span></a>). 
</li>
<li> In MN-CN case, non-disclosure of MN's HoA on its
	      foreign link. 
</li>
<li> No additional changes to IPsec or IKE protocols and
	      limited changes to MIPv6 via four simple messages and an
	      option resulting in simple and generic integration
	      within IPsec and Mobile IPv6 stacks.
</li>
<li> Improved and more generic proof of address ownership
	      mechanism. 
</li>
<li> Safe by default behavior avoiding direct unprotected
	      traffic flows. 
</li>
<li> Complete removal of RH2 and HAO, resulting in
	      simplified packet handling on both sides and possibly
	      better compatibility with filtering implemented in the
	      network. 
</li>
<li> Per packet MTU gains between 24 and 48 bytes in
	      comparison with equivalent uses of IPsec in standard RO
	      context. Details are provided in <a class='info' href='#app.mtugains'>Appendix&nbsp;F<span> (</span><span class='info'>MTU Gains</span><span>)</span></a>. 
</li>
</ul><p>

	
</p>
<p> The main prerequisites of IRO are:<br />
<br />

	  
	  </p>
<ul class="text">
<li> Existence of a trust relationship between peers
	      (i.e. shared secret or ability to use IKE). 
</li>
<li> Required protection of peers' exchanges (i.e. IPsec is
	      used between peers). IRO does not apply to direct
	      unprotected communications between peers. More
	      precisely, IRO prevents them. 
</li>
<li> To fully benefit from IRO improvements, data traffic
	      between the MN and its HA must be exchanged through an
	      IKE-negotiated movement resistant IPsec tunnel. If this
	      hypothesis is not fulfilled, IRO will still be usable
	      but some security features listed previously will be
	      lost (<a class='info' href='#app.mnhaenclack'>Appendix&nbsp;D<span> (</span><span class='info'>Lack of encryption between MN and HA</span><span>)</span></a>).

<a name="rfc.section.2.3"></a><h3>2.3.&nbsp;
Motivation</h3>

<p> The motivation behind this work is the direct need for
	  both efficient and secure communications in Mobile IPv6
	  environments already benefiting from an underlying trust
	  domain. 
</p>
<p> The first intended target of the mechanism described in
	  this memo is the growing number of corporate networks where
	  PKI are now widespread. This is generally due to the
	  increasing number of services (802.1X, SSL/IPsec VPN, TLS
	  Web portal, S/MIME, ...) that use them on a daily basis as
	  the root of their security and to provide logical
	  segregation. It is also suitable for other kinds of
	  communities. 
</p>
<p> In environments where data confidentiality and privacy do
	  matter (IPsec is used for the protection of data between the
	  MN and its HA), current RRP and RO between peers of the
	  trust domain are usually deactivated:<br />
<br />
 
	  
	  </p>
<ul class="text">
<li> to prevent direct unprotected communications between
	      peers that would bypass protected tunneling through the
	      Home Network. 
</li>
<li> because their implementation and setup with IPsec/IKE
	      does not work out of the box and is not trivial even
	      if <a class='info' href='#CNIPsec'>[CNIPsec]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Dupont, F. and JM. Combes, &ldquo;Using IPsec between Mobile and Correspondent IPv6 Nodes,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> helps for signaling.
</li>
</ul><p>
	
</p>
<p> This results in heavy constraints on the HA (which handles
	  all the traffic to/from its MN) and the de-facto inability
	  to get direct end-to-end IPsec-protected MN-CN and MN-MN
	  communications.
	
</p>
<p> The ability to reduce the number of communications
	  performed by the Mobile Node that get tunneled through the
	  HA is both an improvement in term of upload bandwidth
	  consumption on the link to the HA, cryptographic processing
	  requirements on the HA and also in term of latency for
	  applications that directly benefit from end-to-end
	  connections, like Chat, VoIP, Videoconferencing or direct
	  file exchanges. 
</p>
<p> In a sense, there is a kind of vicious circle regarding
	  the use of IPsec/IKE with various protocols, including
	  MIPv6: because dynamic keying and IPsec are not considered
	  the common case, they are not fully covered in specifications
	  (static keying for simple modes). The net effect is that
	  their implementation and deployment is then complicated,
	  which results in limited use. In a sense, IRO tries to break
	  that circle. Simply put, this specification considers
	  IKE-enabled environments as the first target and then covers
	  static keying cases.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1"></a><h3>3.1.&nbsp;
The big picture</h3>

<p> This section simply lists the key ideas and design
	  concepts behind IRO. 
</p>
<p> When IPsec is used between two peers, every packet de
	  facto contains a simple piece of information (the SPI) that
	  gives access to many parameters. Among those parameters
	  synchronized between the two IPsec stacks are address
	  information for both peers.
</p>
<p>Unlike IPsec, MIPv6 uses specific extensions (RH2 and
	  HAO) to explicitly carry address information. When both
	  protocols are used together and the IPsec SA/SP make use of
	  HoA (i.e. not CoA), the RH2 and HAO extensions in packets
	  carry the HoA. This is redundant information which could
	  easily be provided by the IPsec stack.
</p>
<p> Based on previous observation, IRO removes RH2 and HAO
	  extensions from packets and replaces them by simple
	  additional steps on the sender and the receiver: remapping
	  rules for addresses based on the information maintained by
	  the IPsec stack. 
</p>
<p> Previous removal of HAO and RH2 extensions from traffic
	  between peers is also perfectly applicable to the traffic
	  between a MN and its HA. This specification extend the
	  remapping rules to the traffic between a MN and its
	  HA. When IRO is used, RH2 and HAO extensions are simply not
	  seen on the wire as depicted below: 
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
Without IRO:

  HA                                                           MN

                 ESP(MH Type 5 (BU) w/ AltCoA Opt.)/
                 DestOpt(HAO(HoA), nh=50)/
                 IPv6(src=CoA, dst=HA, nh=60)
   &lt;------------------------------------------------------------

                 ESP(MH Type 6 (BA))/
                 RH2(HoA, nh=50)/
                 IPv6(src=HA, dst=CoA, nh=43)
   ------------------------------------------------------------&gt;


With IRO:

  HA                                                           MN

                 ESP(MH Type 5 (BU) w/ AltCoA Opt.)/

   &lt;------------------------------------------------------------

                 IPv6(src=HA, dst=CoA, nh=50)
   ------------------------------------------------------------&gt;

</pre></div>
<p> As stated previously, the hypothesis on which common RO
	  and RRP are based simply do not hold when peers are able to
	  use IPsec/IKE between them. For that reason, even if some
	  proof of address ownership is still required, a more
	  suitable (read simple) mechanism is defined for that
	  purpose. 
</p>
<p> To sum it up (simplistic vision):<br />
<br />

	  </p>
<ul class="text">
<li> IRO simplifies packets format by removing HAO
	      and RH2 extensions.

Pre-binding steps</h3>

<p> Before any direct communication can take place between a
	  MN and a CN, the CN must accept a binding between the CoA
	  and the HoA of the MN. For that to happen, the CN must have
	  acquired the proof of both HoA and CoA addresses ownership
	  by the MN. 
</p>
<p> In RRP, the MN proves to the CN its ability to both send
	  and receive traffic from and at those addresses by a four
	  messages exchange combining both direct and HA-tunneled
	  packets. 
</p>
<p> In the context of IRO, the binding registration between
	  peers is IPsec-protected. It is expected that IKE be used
	  for negotiating an initial pair of ESP transport mode IPsec
	  SAs between the HoA of the MN and the address of the CN for
	  protecting this registration (static keying is covered later
	  in the document). IKE negotiation is performed between the 
	  HoA of the MN and the address of the CN: the use of the HoA
	  implies that IKE packets are routed via the tunnel between
	  the MN and its HA. This provides the CN the initial proof of
	  HoA ownership by the MN. Using the IPsec-protected tunnel
          (expected routing path) between the MN and its HA for IKE
	  negotiation is not straightforward; this is discussed in
	  <a class='info' href='#app.ikeexchangesuses'>Appendix&nbsp;B<span> (</span><span class='info'>IKE exchanges use the HoA and the tunnel to the HA</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p> On both entities, the specific IPsec ESP transport mode
	  SAs (protecting MH traffic) created between the peers are
	  taken into account by IRO code in Mobile IPv6 stack. This
	  triggers the setup of specific "remapping rules" on both
	  entities, that will be applied to incoming and outgoing
	  IPsec packets associated with the SAs:<br />
<br />
 

	  </p>
<ol class="text">
<li> On the MN, the outgoing IPsec traffic associated with
	    the SA to the CN has its source address remapped to the
	    address stored (by MIPv6 process) in the ancillary data of
	    the packet (the CoA). <br />
<br />
 
</li>
<li> On the CN, the incoming IPsec traffic associated with
	    the specific SA from the MN has its source address
	    remapped to the source address in the SA (the HoA of the
	    MN). The remapped address (CoA) is kept as an ancillary
	    data in the local packet structure for further
	    processing. The packet is then naturally handled by the
	    IPsec stack. <br />
<br />
 
</li>
<li> On the CN, the outgoing IPsec traffic associated with
	    the SA to the MN has its destination address remapped to
	    the address stored in the ancillary data of the packet, if
	    not null. <br />
<br />
 
</li>
<li> On the MN, the incoming IPsec traffic associated with
	    the SA to the CN has its destination address compared with
	    the CoA the MN is asking a binding for to the CN. On
	    match, the destination address of the IPsec packet is
	    remapped to the destination address in the SA (the HoA of
	    the MN). The packet is then naturally handled by the IPsec
	    stack. 
</li>
</ol><p>

	
</p>
<p> Simply stated, rules 1 and 3 will end up performing a
	  remapping of HoA used in outgoing IPsec packets in their CoA
	  counterparts and rules 2 and 4 will do the opposite on the
	  other side for incoming IPsec packets. This is depicted in
	  <a class='info' href='#buemission'>Section&nbsp;3.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>BU emission</span><span>)</span></a>. 
</p>
<p> Note that these rules apply only to IPsec packets
	  associated with SA that protect MH traffic. They are used
	  before any data packet is received or sent by the entities
	  using a direct path.

BU emission</h3>

<p> The MIPv6 stack on the MN emits a Binding Update packet
	  containing a Mobility Header AltCoA option which carries the
	  CoA it is proposing a binding for to the CN. This packet is
	  sent from the HoA of the MN to the address of the peer. The
	  CoA is put as an ancillary data in the local packet
	  structure for further processing. As it matches the IPsec SA
	  put in place between the MN and the peer, it gets handled by
	  the IPsec stack to be ESP protected. Before leaving the MN,
	  it passes the set of MIPv6 rules for the MN; a match is
	  found against rule 1, so that the source address of the
	  packet is remapped to the address available as an ancillary
	  data in the packet, the CoA of the MN. This is depicted

Proof of CoA ownership</h3>

<p> At that point, before accepting the binding and replying
	  with a BA, the CN must have the proof of CoA ownership from
	  the MN. If one is already available, it simply goes on and
	  sends a BA, as described in 3.5. Otherwise, it first performs
	  following steps. 
</p>
<p> It sends a newly defined AOTC message (Address
	  Ownership Test Challenge) to the MN, providing the CoA as
	  ancillary data, so that the remapping rules will make the
	  packet use the CoA for the address found in the IPv6 header
	  destination field. This packets carries a freshly generated
	  nonce. It is recorder locally for a future check. 
</p>
<p> On the MN, the packet follows the reverse remapping
	  process, the CoA being remapped to the HoA and passed as
	  ancillary data. The MIPv6 stack replies with an IPsec
	  protected AOTR message (Address Ownership Test Request) to
	  the CN , using the HoA as local source but providing the CoA
	  as ancillary data. The remapping rule makes the CoA the
	  on-wire address of the packet. This packets carries the
	  nonce sent by the CN. 
</p>
<p> The CN receives the packet and after having checked the
	  source address and the nonce against the one previously
	  sent, the MIPv6 stack records the address ownership of the
	  CoA for that MN, and continues with the steps described

BA emission</h3>

<p> The CN constructs a Binding Acknowledgement packet to be
	  sent to the HoA of the MN. The CoA of the MN is put as an
	  ancillary data in the local packet structure for further
	  processing. Now, as the BA matches the SA, it is
	  ESP-protected and passes the set of MIPv6 rules for the
	  CN. It matches rule 3 and the HoA is replaced with the
	  address available in the ancillary data of the packet (MN's
	  CoA). The packet is then sent. At that moment, if the status
	  code in the BA is 0 (Binding Update Accepted), the binding
	  is effective on the CN. 
</p>
<p> On the MN, the IPsec protected BA is received, it is
	  passed through the set of MIPv6 rules for the MN and matches
	  rule 4. The destination address is changed to the destination
	  address of the SA (HoA of the MN). It is then handled by the
	  IPsec module, and then by the MIPv6 process. If the status
	  code in the BA is 0, the binding is effective on the MN. 
</p>
<p> For the rest of this section, we consider the binding is
	  effective on both sides. Other scenarios are covered in
	  details in <a class='info' href='#overview'>Section&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Overview</span><span>)</span></a>.

Post-bindings steps</h3>

<p> In <a class='info' href='#RFC3775'>[RFC3775]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Johnson, D., Perkins, C., and J. Arkko, &ldquo;Mobility Support in IPv6,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>, when the RRP has completed successfully,
	  routing of traffic between the MN and the CN is
	  automatically modified to follow a direct path. With IRO, on
	  the contrary, a successful binding between a MN and a CN
	  does not trigger any change in routing of _regular_ traffic
	  between the MN and the CN. It still flows using the IPsec
	  tunnel through the MN's HA. Only IPsec traffic is optimized.
</p>
<p> This design decision provides a "safe by default" behavior
	  and avoids a successful binding to lead to unprotected direct
	  communications. 
</p>
<p> Furthermore, only IPsec flows will be able to take
	  advantage of the direct path between the MN and the
	  CN. Arguments for this design are provided
	  in <a class='info' href='#app.noprotection'>Appendix&nbsp;E<span> (</span><span class='info'>What if I don't need protection?</span><span>)</span></a>. 
</p>
<p> So, if existing IPsec SAs protecting non-signaling traffic
	  (data) are already available on both sides, that have the
	  HoA and the address of the MN as address selectors,
	  remapping rules are put in place to perform the same kind of
	  address changes presented in four previous rules. Those
	  rules are static ones (they do not use any ancillary data)
	  that remap CoA to HoA and HoA to CoA (after some checks),
	  respectively before and after IPsec processing.
</p>
<p> They simply replace the HAO and RH2 headers inclusion and
	  parsing on both sides by using address information provided
	  by the IPsec stack.

Position of the problem</h3>

<p> A CN accepting a binding for the CoA of a peer is not
	something harmless. In the context of IRO, this decision is
	based on: <br />
<br />

	
	</p>
<ul class="text">
<li> a proof of HoA ownership by the MN at the time the SA is 
	    negotiated. 
</li>
<li> a proof of CoA ownership by the MN.
</li>
</ul><p>
      
</p>
<p> The existence of a strong trust relationship between the two
	(pairs of SA) and an easy proof of emission capability from
	the CoA are unfortunately insufficient proofs of CoA
	ownership. As covered in <a class='info' href='#app.pcoao'>Appendix&nbsp;A<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ability to send does not prove CoA ownership</span><span>)</span></a>, a proof of the ability
	for the MN to receive traffic at its asserted CoA is
	required to workaround the lack of ingress-filtering at the
	scale of Internet: it avoids the CN to involuntarily take
	part in a DoS against the provided CoA.

<a name="rfc.section.4.2"></a><h3>4.2.&nbsp;
Overview</h3>

<p> As the proof of HoA ownership is only required to occur
      once in the context of IRO, the mechanism focuses on the
      proof of CoA ownership. Instead of reusing the complicated
      RRP, IRO directly benefits from the available IPsec
      protection between the MN and its CN to simplify
      things. 
</p>
<p> Furthermore, in the context of IRO, the lifetime of the
      provided proof is no longer limited and generally
      de-correlated from registration steps. This already reduces
      the amount of transferred data and leaves room for further
      optimizations (nodes with multiple simultaneous connections,
      nodes with limited numbers of foreign networks, ...). 
</p>
<p> As CoTI and CoT messages have some associated
      requirements, options and semantic, and also lacks some
      expressiveness, they are not reused for IRO proof of address
      ownership. It is based on the four new extremely simple
      messages introduced previously:<br />
<br />

      
      </p>
<ul class="text">
<li> AOTO (Address Ownership Test Offer): Sent by a MN to a CN
	to offer to prove address ownership. 
</li>
<li> AOTC (Address Ownership Test Challenge): Sent by a CN to
	the MN at the address to be tested, with a Nonce option that
	will be returned in an AOTR message. 
</li>
<li> AOTR (Address Ownership Test Response): Sent by the MN as
	a response to an AOTC, with the received Nonce option. 
</li>

<p> This message is sent by a MN to a CN to offer to prove its

<p> With this message, a MN can prove its ownership of
      additional addresses (future CoA) in advance. For instance, a MN
      with Wifi and 3G connectivity, with an already registered
      binding for the CoA configured on its Wifi interface can thus
      prove ownership of the address configured on its 3G
      interface. Upon movement, when switching to 3G connectivity,
      this proof of ownership will not be required. This is described

Registration with a CN</h3>

<p> The registration process between a MN and its HA is
	simple and efficient, being made of a simple BU/BA
	exchange. This is because the proof of CoA ownership is
	not required by the HA from the MN. 
</p>
<p> Like with other route optimization procedures, with IRO,
	the CN is required to have a proof of CoA ownership
	available for the MN before accepting a binding and
	replying with a Binding Ack. More precisely, the proof is
	needed only before sending traffic to the CoA of the MN
	but does not impact the reception of traffic from the
	CoA. This is of particular importance in the rest of the
	discussion. 
</p>
<p> Unlike in other more common environments where the proof
	has to be made at every binding, or "renewed", IRO uses
	proofs with unlimited lifetimes. This does not mean that
	once the ownership has been proved to a CN the CoA will
	indefinitely belong to a MN. The decision is always left
	to the CN, with the expectation that some sufficient
	temporary storage will make it capable to keep the binding
	for a while. 
</p>
<p> This means that if a proof of CoA ownership for a MN is
	available locally on its CN, no live proof is required and
	a simple BU/BA exchange is sufficient for the
	registration to occur. This also means that inside small
	or medium communities, where MN move between few
	locations, the number of potential CoA remains quite low
	and stable, and can be kept locally on nodes acting as
	CN. 
</p>
<p> For instance, without limiting the possible uses, a typical
	scenario for a daily use includes an address at home (wifi,
	...), another on a mobile network (3G, ...) and another
	at work (wifi, Ethernet, ...).  
</p>
<p> With IRO, when a MN sends a BU to a CN for registration
	or reregistration purposes, it starts directing its
	traffic instantly after the emission of the BU to the
	address of the CN. Then, the CN will either ask for proof
	of CoA ownership if it has none available from that MN for
	that CoA or send a BA to the peer. In all cases, it puts
	in place the remapping rules for accepting traffic from
	the CoA (and not the one for emission). That way, there is
	no disruption of traffic from the MN to the CN. 
</p>
<p> If the CN replies with an AOTC message sent to the CoA
	of the MN, the MN replies with an AOTR, proving its
	complete ownership. The CN then replies with the expected
	BA and puts in place the required remapping rules for the
	traffic to flow to the MN at its CoA. 
</p>
<p> Regarding re-emission, if the MN has no reply from the CN
	(i.e. no BA or AOTC), common re-emission rules apply. Then,
	if the CN has sent an AOTC, but receives no reply, it can
	keep things that way or garbage collect the remapping rule
	(i.e. remove it after some time). If the MN receives no BA
	from the CN, it performs re-emission of the AOTR (This
	implies that the Nonce must be kept locally on the CN even
	after the emission of the BA).

Early test of CoA ownership</h3>

<p> There are cases where a MN will be willing to perform

	message to the CN, and receives either and AOTC or an

Test of HoA ownership</h3>

<p> IRO does not mandate regular proofs of HoA ownership,
	for the reasons covered in
	<a class='info' href='#app.noregularcheck'>Appendix&nbsp;C<span> (</span><span class='info'>Arguments for no regular check of HoA ownership</span><span>)</span></a>. For those who have
	the need, and can afford to lose the associated bits on a
	regular basis, the AOT* messages can be used for that
	purpose. The following helps supporting that.
</p>
<p> If a CN wants to get a live proof of HoA ownership from
	a MN, it simply emits an AOTC message (with a fresh Nonce
	option) to the HoA of the MN for which it has already
	accepted a registration. The MN MUST reply with an AOTR
	message containing the received Nonce option. The exchange
	occurs using the HoA as on-wire destination
	and source address respectively. This implies that the packets are
	tunneled through MN's HA. In the MN-MN case, this mainly
	results in packets never following a direct path. 
</p>
<p> Note that this specification does not define the action
	taken by a CN if it does not receive AOTR messages as
	response to its AOTC messages sent to the HoA.

Overview</h3>

<p>As introduced in the beginning of this memo, in order to

	IRO defines the concept of remapping rules. 
</p>
<p> A remapping rule is associated with a specific type of
	outgoing or incoming (IPsec-protected) traffic (typically the 
	traffic associated with a given SP). A remapping rule modifies
	either the source or destination address of matching
	traffic. IRO remapping rules only apply to IPsec-protected 
	traffic. Unprotected traffic is not modified by IRO remapping
	process.

Remapping rules for outgoing traffic</h3>

<p> An IRO remapping rule for outgoing traffic is used to
	change either the on-wire source or destination address of
	IPsec-protected emitted packets. For a matching outgoing
	packet, this remapping process is performed after the
	processing by the IPsec stack:<br />
<br />

	</p>
<ul class="text">
<li> If such a rule remaps the destination address of a
	  packet, it is used to turn the HoA of the remote peer into
	  its CoA, so that the traffic be routed to its current

</li>
<li> If such a rule remaps the source address of a packet, it
	  is used to turn the MN's HoA into its current CoA, so that
	  the source address of the packet is compatible with the
	  network the MN is currently in. 
</li>
</ul><p>
	
</p>
<p> The address to be used (CoA) for the remapping may be

	with the packet. This second approach is described in

Remapping rules for incoming traffic</h3>

<p> An IRO remapping rule for incoming traffic is used to
	change either the on-wire source or destination address of
	IPsec-protected received packets. For each incoming packet,
	this remapping process is performed before the processing by
	the IPsec stack::<br />
<br />

	</p>
<ul class="text">
<li> If such a rule remaps the destination address of a

</li>
<li> If such a rule remaps the source address of a packet, it
	  is used to turn the peer's CoA into its current HoA, so that

</li>
</ul><p> 
</p>
<p> The address to be used (CoA) for the remapping may be

	on-wire address found in the packet before the remapping is

	address (::), then the on-wire address found in the packet is
	not verified. Additionally, as described in <a class='info' href='#addruserlandaccess'>Section&nbsp;5.1.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>On-wire addresses access from userland</span><span>)</span></a> below, the on-wire address found

	(e.g. using socket options): this may be used for additional
	userland checks.

On-wire addresses access from userland</h3>

<p> With IRO, there is a need for the MIPv6 processing
	    engine to both pass and get on-wire source and destination
	    addresses of received and emitted IPsec protected MH
	    packets. This need is mainly associated with the proof of
	    address ownership and binding exchanges. The need is
	    similar to the one associated with the ability to
	    set and get HAO/RH2 for a common MIPv6 process. Instead of
	    having explicit information in the packet, an ancillary
	    path is required. 
</p>
<p> This requirement is limited only to MH traffic in
	    general and some specific MH types in particular. 
</p>
<p> For incoming IPsec protected MH packets, this means that
	    during the handling by remapping rules, the remapped
	    on-wire address must be kept in the local packet structure
	    as an ancillary data that the MIPv6 process will be able
	    to access. 
</p>
<p> For outgoing MH packets, this means that the addresses
	    MUST be made available as ancillary data in the local
	    packet structures by the MIPv6 process and then be used,
	    if available, by the remapping rules.
</p>
<p> For all incoming IPsec packets associated with a coarse
	    or fine grained SA for MH traffic, if a remapping rule is
	    applied to the traffic, the on-wire source and destination
	    addresses MUST be made available as ancillary data to
	    the userland process that will process the packet (i.e. at
	    socket level). In all cases (remapping rule being applied
	    or not), if an on-wire source or destination address is
	    not changed, the associated ancillary data MUST contain
	    the unspecified address (::).

</p>
<p> Basically, the checks and settings on source and

	    protection of MH traffic. Granularity considerations are
	    covered below. 
</p>
<p> The search for remapping rules is done in the same

<p> If a remapping rule is found for source address, which

	      is performed without checking the source address of the
	      packet. The unspecified address is used as a

</p>
<p> In source rule case, the on-wire address found in the

</p>
<p> Note that this specification does not explicitly
	      mandate when the unspecified address should be used in
	      the source remapping rule, and leave that to
	      implementors, as it is highly dependent of following
	      facts:<br />
<br />

	      
	      </p>
<ul class="text">
<li> if the system does not support fine-grained SP/SA
		  or simply does not use them for MH traffic with a
		  peer, then the use of the unspecified address will
		  be required. 
</li>
<li> if fine-grained SA are used, the MIPv6 stack will
		  use the unspecified address if the traffic received
		  protected by that SA can't be reliably mapped to a
		  specific CoA for the peer, i.e. if it is expected
		  and authorized that the peer sends traffic from
		  another [possibly to be registered] CoA. This is the
		  case for BU, AOTO, AOTR traffic for instance.
</li>
<li> if the MIPv6 stack supports extensions to
		  <a class='info' href='#RFC3775'>[RFC3775]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Johnson, D., Perkins, C., and J. Arkko, &ldquo;Mobility Support in IPv6,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>-defined MH messages, the use of IRO will
		  still remain possible with those extensions. 
</li>
</ul><p>
	    
</p>
<p> Note that this decision is not expected to create
	      interoperability issues, as the use of the unspecified
	      address is based on non-ambiguous criteria defined in
	      the documents specifying the purpose of MH traffic.
</p>
<p> Also note that the use of the unspecified address for
	      checks and the passing of the on-wire address to the
	      MIPv6 stack for further processing is equivalent from a
	      security standpoint to the decision that occurs in
	      common MIPv6 processing of HAO extension.

Outgoing traffic</h3>

<p> Emission of IPsec-protected MH traffic by an
	    IRO-enabled node is conceptually similar to the steps
	    described in <a class='info' href='#outnonmh'>Section&nbsp;5.2.1.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Outgoing traffic</span><span>)</span></a> regarding the
	    application of the remapping rules for data traffic. 
</p>
<p> Nonetheless, unlike remapping rules applying to data
	    traffic (for which the address used for the remapping is
	    expected to be available statically in the rule), it is
	    possible that a userland MIPv6 implementation uses an
	    ancillary path to provide the address used for the
	    remapping. This may for instance provide more control and
	    granularity. This is partly discussed in <a class='info' href='#implementation'>Section&nbsp;7<span> (</span><span class='info'>Implementation Notes</span><span>)</span></a> ("Implementation notes").

Related traffic (ICMPv6 error messages ...)</h3>

<p> When an ICMPv6 Error message (.e.g. for PMTUD) is

	  traffic in its citation, the IPsec stack processes the
	  message as usual (probably based on what is described in

	  because the citation in the ICMPv6 Error message may
	  contain remapped addresses, an additional step is needed
	  before (or at the beginning of) the processing by the
	  IPsec stack, in order to check if a the reverse remapping
	  of the addresses in the packet is required. Conceptually,
	  this additional step is similar to the processing
	  performed on citations containing RH2 and HAO elements,
	  except that the real source and destination 
	  addresses are not explicitly available in the packet, but
	  need to be provided by the IPsec stack, using the SPI

Rationale and expected advantages</h3>

<p> IRO's primary purpose is to improve security and
	  efficiency of MIPv6 communications in IPsec
	  environments. Because most of them are expected to occur
	  directly between peers, IRO is oriented towards MN-CN and
	  MN-MN flows.
</p>
<p> But the flows between a MN and its HA can also benefit
	  from the improvements: using the SPI information available
	  on both sides to perform the remapping of incoming and
	  outgoing IPsec traffic, the need of RH2 and HAO extensions
	  between the MN and its HA simply disappears. This provides
	  anonymity (See <a class='info' href='#app.anonymity'>Appendix&nbsp;J<span> (</span><span class='info'>Anonymity</span><span>)</span></a>) of the MN on a foreign link by
	  hiding its HoA to eavesdropper on the path (if IKE does not
	  leak that information). It also makes the MN fully capable
	  in networks were only IPsec is allowed to flow (500/udp is
	  required for the initial negotiation of SA and infrequently
	  for rekeying).

Changes to HA processing</h3>

<p> IRO does not mandate a detection mechanism

</p>
<p> The changes to HA processing for the peer, required by the
	  use of IRO, are simply the use of remapping rules instead of
	  HAO and RH2 extensions. 
</p>
<p> With IRO, the relationship between a MN and one of its CN

<ul class="text">
<li> HA and MN never exchange AOT* messages as the MN is

Problem</h3>

<p> The main purpose of IRO is to route optimize IPsec
	  traffic exchanged between the MN (from its HoA) and its
	  CN. Before that optimization takes places (i.e. before the
	  AOT* exchanges), that traffic is expected to follow the
	  natural path, i.e. be routed via the tunnel to the HA. 
</p>
<p> In IPsec environments, chances are high the data path to
	  the HA will be IPsec-protected, using IPsec in tunnel mode
	  as (optionally) expected by MIPv6 specifications. In that
	  case, before the optimization is effective, traffic sent by
	  the MN to the remote IPsec peer will have to undergo both
	  the protection of the specific SA protecting the end-to-end
	  traffic with the peer and the tunnel one protecting the data
	  traffic to the HA. This is required (at least for
	  topological reasons) because the HoA is only valid as an
	  inner address for tunneled traffic. This is depicted below
	  with a MN having E2E IPsec-protected communications with two
	  peers (CN1 and CN2) via its HA. The layout of traffic is
	  given for packets sent by the MN; the format of traffic sent
	  by the (the format of return
	  traffic ). :

<p> In the specific context of IRO, there may be a need for

Problem</h3>

<p> Traffic generated by an IKE daemon needs to bypass the 
	    system's security policies in order to avoid chicken and
	    eggs issues. Unix IKE daemons implementation usually
	    achieve that using a specific IPsec bypass setsockopt()
	    call on their sockets.
</p>
<p> In common situations, previous method works just
	    fine. But when an IPsec data tunnel already exists on the
	    system as it is usually the case for corporate VPN
	    clients, this method prevents the use of the inner tunnel
	    address for IKE negotiation with remote peers accessible
	    only via the remote security gateway (e.g. hosts in the
	    corporate network). Stated differently, this prevents the
	    setup of end-to-end IPsec protection via the IPsec
	    tunnel. 
</p>
<p> More precisely, if the IKE daemon tries and use the
	    inner address for negotiation with a peer, the IPsec
	    bypass setsockopt() call on associated socket prevents
	    associated IKE traffic to flow correctly. This is because,
	    from a topological standpoint, the only valid path for
	    traffic originating from that address is via the IPsec
	    tunnel. 
</p>
<p> When MIPv6 data traffic between the MN and its HA is
	    required by policy to undergo IPsec tunnel protection, the
	    same limitation as described above exists. For the
	    specific needs of IRO, this is an issue because the HoA is
	    used for the IKE negotiation with the CN (whose side
	    effect is also to prove HoA ownership to the peer).

Selected solution</h3>

<p> For the sake of the discussion, we consider the
	  existence of some wide IPsec SP requiring protection of all
	  traffic from the HoA to a given peer behind the HA. To make
	  things clear, IKE traffic (500/udp) between the HoA and the
	  address of the peer matches this SP's selectors. 
</p>
<p> Obviously, the simple removal of the IPsec bypass
	  setsockopt() on the socket associated with the HoA is not
	  sufficient to make things work. This would have initially
	  been sufficient to have associated IKE traffic undergo the
	  IPsec tunnel mode SP (protecting data traffic between the MN
	  and its HA). But the existence of the additional SP creates
	  a chicken and eggs situation and prevents things to work
	  that easily. 
</p>
<p> But once the IPsec bypass setsockopt() call is removed
	  for the IKE socket associated with the HoA, associated
	  traffic basically undergo the system security
	  policies. Then, the addition of a high priority SP with
	  selectors specifically suited for IKE traffic from the HoA
	  to the address of the peer is sufficient to have the IKE
	  traffic be IPsec tunneled using the existing SA already
	  protecting MIPv6 data traffic.
</p>
<p> From an implementation perspective, the removal of the
	  IPsec bypass setsockopt() call has been implemented by
	  adding a simple option ('no_bypass') to the racoon IKE daemon
	  allowing the user to specify an address for which associated
	  socket should not undergo the setsockopt() call. 
</p>
<p> With regard to the addition of the high priority
	  IPsec security policy matching IKE traffic between the HoA
	  and the address of the peer, it was easier to have that job
	  done inside UMIP. This is basically because UMIP is already
	  the one handling the installation of other security policies
	  for MIPv6 and data traffic. Another reason is that UMIP will
	  need to update the tunnel mode SP after a handover
	  (via <a class='info' href='#MIGRATE'>[MIGRATE]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ebalard, A. and S. Decugis, &ldquo;PF_KEY Extension as an Interface between Mobile IPv6              and IPsec/IKE,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>).

Selected solution</h3>

<p> Linux IPsec stack currently follows the model defined in
	  the old IPsec Architecture; it makes use of the destination
	  address, the SPI and the IPsec protocol for lookups of SA in
	  the SADB upon reception of an IPsec-protected packet. Those
	  parameters are hashed together for efficient access to the
	  associated SA via a hashtable.
</p>
<p> To support IRO needs, this behaviour has been changed in

	  inbound packets without considering the destination address,
	  i.e. using mainly the SPI.
</p>
<p> For traffic matching an IRO remapping rule mandating the
	  remapping of either source or destination address, the one
	  available in the found SA (after the lookup by SPI) is used
	  after a check that received on-wire address matches the
	  expected address in the remapping rule. 
</p>
<p> For common inbound IPsec packets not undergoing any IRO
	  processing, mismatch between the destination address in
	  the packet and the one in the SA simply results in the
	  packet being dropped. 
</p>
<p> This simple modification has allowed the implementation of
	  IRO remapping based on address information stored in the
	  IPsec stack (HoA to be used for remapping), even for inbound

Position of the problem</h3>

<p> As a CN, registering a binding between a CoA and a HoA
	    is not something harmless. This can be seen as a
	    modification of local routing table, like an order from a
	    peer to direct traffic to a specific address. For that
	    reason, the CN needs some proof regarding this binding. In
	    MIPv6, RRP has been designed with the hypothesis that
	    there is no initial trust relationship between a MN and
	    its CN. The solution to provide confidence to the CN in
	    the HoA and CoA binding has consisted in showing the
	    ability for the MN to send _and_ receive traffic both at
	    the HoA and CoA. 
</p>
<p> With IRO, there is an initial trust relationship between
	    a MN and the CN it will contact. This is expected to take
	    the form of cryptographic credentials (X.509 certificates,
	    ...) that will allow an IKE negotiation to occur to setup
	    SAs to protect the binding. Static keying case is covered
	    in <a class='info' href='#app.statickeying'>Appendix&nbsp;G<span> (</span><span class='info'>Compatibility with static keying</span><span>)</span></a>. Those SA only references the HoA of the MN
	    and not at all its CoA. 
</p>
<p> The point here is that the existence of SAs does not
	    directly provide to the CN any _live_ proof of address
	    ownership as it occurs with RRP. 
</p>
<p> Furthermore, as summarized in section 6.2
	    of <a class='info' href='#RFC4866'>[RFC4866]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Arkko, J., Vogt, C., and W. Haddad, &ldquo;Enhanced Route Optimization for Mobile IPv6,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> paragraph 4, the 
	    trust relationship between a HA and its MN is very
	    different from the one between a MN and a CN, even if both
	    use IPsec/IKE to authenticate.

<a name="rfc.section.8.1.2"></a><h3>8.1.2.&nbsp;
Home Address ownership</h3>

<p> The proof of HoA ownership to the CN is one of the
	    reason behind the design decision to have MN and CN
	    perform the IKE negotiation via the tunnel to the HA
	    (i.e. using the HoA). That way, the existence of the SAs
	    gets bound to a successful initial exchange between the CN
	    and the MN. This proves to the CN the ability for the MN
	    to send/receive traffic from/at that address. 
</p>
<p> Nonetheless, as IKE basically allows negotiation to be
	    performed from a different address than the one the SA
	    contain ([MIGRATE] has such an use), this behavior MUST be
	    prevented on the CN for the purpose of negotiations of the
	    initial SAs that will protect MH traffic for IRO's binding
	    between the MN and the CN.
</p>
<p> While MN and CN are capable of performing an IKE exchange
	    between them using a set of credentials, there are many
	    possible reasons for which those credentials might in fact
	    be invalid at the time the negotiation occurs. This might
	    for instance be the case if the CN has not up-to-date
	    revocation information. This can also result from the use
	    by the MN of a different set of credentials for the
	    purpose of protecting its HA registration and the
	    registration with its CN. 
</p>
<p> Mandating the IKE negotiation to be routed through the
	    tunnel to the HA provides the proof that the MN is still
	    granted ownership of the address by the network it belongs
	    to at the time of negotiation. It should be noted that the
	    proof of HoA ownership occurs at SA setup time and remains
	    valid till the SA is rekeyed, i.e. each rekeying providing
	    a new live proof. This specification does not mandate
	    regular check of HoA ownership between
	    rekeying. <a class='info' href='#app.noregularcheck'>Appendix&nbsp;C<span> (</span><span class='info'>Arguments for no regular check of HoA ownership</span><span>)</span></a>
	    provides arguments on that topic.

<p> The case of static keying is covered

Care-of Address ownership</h3>

<p> The proof of CoA ownership by the CN is an especially
	    important point in the security of large scale deployments
	    of IRO. As stated in the introduction of this section, the
	    acceptance of a binding by a CN for a CoA is a
	    modification of local routing table to send current and
	    future traffic to that address when it is destined to the
	    HoA. 
</p>
<p> The proof by the MN that it is able to both send and
	    receive traffic at this address is a primary concern in
	    the security of the protocol. <a class='info' href='#app.pcoao'>Appendix&nbsp;A<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ability to send does not prove CoA ownership</span><span>)</span></a> covers the

<a name="rfc.section.A"></a><h3>Appendix A.&nbsp;
Ability to send does not prove CoA ownership</h3>

<p> With IRO, negotiation of the protection (via IKE) for the registration
	traffic between the peers is done using the tunnel to the Home
	Agent (i.e. the HoA). Then, the protected Binding Update
	message is emitted by the MN. It locally uses the HoA but a
	remapping process makes the CoA the address appearing on the
	wire for this packet. When the CN receives that packet, the
	address is remapped to the HoA of the MN by the MIPv6
	stack. The remapped address appearing as source of the packet
	is passed as ancillary data to the MIPv6 process where a check
	will be performed during parsing against the content of the
	required Alternate Care-of Address option. 
</p>
<p> This process proves the CN that the MN is able to _send_
	traffic using the CoA. 
</p>
<p> Then, IRO requires additional steps for the MN to prove
	its ability to receive traffic at that address. This appendix
	covers the threats prevented by the addition of this proof of
	reception capability in IRO. 
</p>
<p> The trust model between the MN and its HA is based on the
	existence of the IPsec protection between the two. The only 
	requirement for the update of the tunnel endpoint when a
	movement occur is the reception by the HA of a protected
	Binding Update message containing the new CoA in the
	Alternate CoA option. The use of the new CoA as source of the
	packet is not even mandatory. 
</p>
<p> One would argue that the same kind of trust relationship
	exists between the MN and its CN as they already have an
	established trust relationship, materialized by the pair of SA
	protecting MH traffic. Nonetheless there are many difference
	between both situations.
</p>
<p> The first and main one is that all the traffic emitted by
	the HA to the CoA provided by the MN has a traceable source:
	the address of the HA, which belongs to the home network. It
	allows to track the source of the traffic emitted to the CoA
	back to the Home Network. In the context of the flow
	from the CN to the MN, the source address might
	possibly be that of a foreign network (if the CN is also
	acting as a MN) and the destination is the one that would be
	provided by the MN. 
</p>
<p> Now consider the following, still in the context of a proof
	of address ownership based solely on the ability of the MN to
	emit traffic from the CoA. A MN has been compromised by an
	attacker that has the ability to emit traffic with the address
	of a target (no ingress-filtering by its provider). The
	attacker would now be able to mount connections with the HA
	and then, using IRO, with all the peers that trust the MN. At
	the moment, it still uses some valid address where it can
	emit/receive traffic from/to. After having some traffic
	intensive connection running with a peer, it simply warns the
	peer of a change of CoA by advertising the address of the
	target. As the CN does not require a proof of reception
	capability, all the IPsec traffic gets redirected to the
	target. This might not be a problem with a single peer and
	some connected protocol but it is expected that the protocol
	be used in vast trust domains where the number of peers is not
	directly limited. 
</p>
<p> In the end, requiring that the proof of CoA ownership
	includes a proof of reception capability by the MN at the CoA
	prevents that compromise of a MN by an attacker provides
	her with a potentially unlimited number of anonymous and
	unwilling "bots" to DoS a target other than herself. 
</p>
<p> In the design of IRO, to maintain the efficiency of the

<a name="rfc.section.B"></a><h3>Appendix B.&nbsp;
IKE exchanges use the HoA and the tunnel to the HA</h3>

<p> Remainder: in this appendix, we still consider that the data
	tunnel between the HA and the MN is IPsec protected. Some
	security arguments in this appendix should be modulated if
	this hypothesis is known to be invalid.
</p>
<p> We provide here some arguments regarding the use of the HoA
	for performing the IKE exchanges with the peers, using the
	tunnel through the HA. 
</p>
<p> The first simple rule which always applies with IRO is that
	no connection happens directly if it is not
	IPsec-protected. No difference is made for IKE exchanges even
	if those flows have intrinsic protection mechanisms.
</p>
<p> The need for performing IRO to get direct routing between
	the peers is motivated by the net performance impact in terms
	of bandwidth, delay and jitter by avoiding triangular routing
	and the bottleneck of HA. This is of interest for specific
	flows like VoIP, direct file exchanges, ... but are mainly
	useless for infrequent flows like IKE negotiations. When a MN
	performs IKE negotiation with a peer, having IKE_SA (or ISAKMP
	SA for IKEv1) set up is only a matter of few packets (IKEv1
	Main mode exchange uses six). Then, all next CHILD_SA (or
	IPsec SA for IKEv1) will reuse the same IKE_SA and generally
	complete after a three packet exchange. As rekeying is
	supposed to occur extremely infrequently and does not need the
	advantage of direct routing, this is unneeded. The argument
	regarding the loss associated with the routing through the
	tunnel gets the same answer: the impact is very limited given
	the amount of traffic. Furthermore, when certificates are used,
	IKE packets already get fragmented even with a full 1500 bytes
	PMTU. 
</p>
<p> In fact, the advantage of using the HoA and the IPsec tunnel
	to the HA for performing IKE negotiation with peers is the
	stability  guaranteed by the migration process when movement
	occurs. MIPv6 simply makes things transparent for all IKE
	daemon connections from the HoA.
</p>
<p> To conclude and after all previous functional arguments, there
	are also some security advantages in performing IKE negotiations
	with peers using the protected IPsec tunnel to the HA. 
</p>
<p> The most important one is anonymity. A positive side effect
	of having the negotiation performed through the IPsec tunnel
	to the HA (ESP with meaningful encryption is assumed) is that
	it hides everything to people in MN's foreign network. IKE traffic is
	only accessible on the path between the HA and the peer. In
	fact, in the MN-MN situation eavesdroppers on both foreign
	networks are unable to get the HoA of the peer on the other
	network. It requires being on the path between the two HA. The
	same is also true for the identity information that might
	appear during the IKE negotiation depending on the modes peers
	use. 
</p>
<p> Another security advantage with that policy is that a peer is
	able to statefully filter 500/udp traffic received on its CoA
	and allow only outbound initiated connections addressed to the
	HoA. This policy simply allows reducing the network attack
	surface of the node in the foreign network.

<a name="rfc.section.C"></a><h3>Appendix C.&nbsp;
Arguments for no regular check of HoA ownership</h3>

<p> As presented in <a class='info' href='#sechoao'>Section&nbsp;8.1.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Home Address ownership</span><span>)</span></a>, when dynamic keying is used,
	the initial IKE negotiation protecting the registration
	traffic between the MN and the CN provides to the CN the proof
	of HoA ownership by the MN. This proof remains valid till this
	SA is rekeyed. This is also true for further SA negotiated
	between the MN and the CN. 
</p>
<p> The initial proof of HoA ownership is easily obtained as it
	results from a positive information: packets exchanged with
	the MN at this address. Note that the inability for the MN or
	the CN to get traffic routed to the HA at that moment results
	in the inability to get direct connectivity as the IKE
	negotiation cannot be performed. In the same fashion, after
	the initial proof, there is no defined way to track a loss of
	HoA ownership through a positive event: the CN is simply not
	warned that the MN has been removed ownership of its HoA by
	its home network (resulting from a compromise, change of
	network prefix, ...). Discovery of a loss of HoA ownership
	cannot be tracked by a negative event either, such as the
	inability to exchange traffic with the MN at a specific
	moment. In fact, a crash of the HA, the loss of connectivity
	between the MN and its HA, or between the CN and the HA are to
	be expected. In that context, such a mechanism would simply
	amplify the existence of points of failure or allow DoS to
	occur. Avoiding that provides resilience and allows direct
	communications to survive previous failure conditions related
	to the HA. 
</p>
<p> Another reason to prevent regular proof of HoA ownership is
	the use of the HoA in IRO. It acts as a local identifier on
	both peers. It allows the MN to acquire movement independence
	and can be seen as a convenience in the relationship between
	the peers, to find themselves initially, no matter where they
	are located. With IRO, the HoA never appears anymore in packet
	exchanged directly between the peers (due to removal of HAO
	and RH2). It is only understood locally in the context of
	ongoing IPsec communications between the peers. 
</p>
<p> The last argument for not including this requirement
	(capability is provided, see <a class='info' href='#hoaotest'>Section&nbsp;4.5.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Test of HoA ownership</span><span>)</span></a>) in the protocol
	is that different CN or MN might have different more
	efficient methods for performing that tracking. For instance,
	inside a home network, instead of using a constant regular
	polling by all MNs, an administrator revoking the credentials
	of a MN will easily be able to request all MNs to update their
	revocation information, before shutting down communications
	with associated MN (i.e. replacing polling by push).
</p>
<p> In the context of IRO, no mechanism to perform regular
	checks of HoA ownership is included. This capability is
	outside the scope of this specification.

<a name="rfc.section.D"></a><h3>Appendix D.&nbsp;
Lack of encryption between MN and HA</h3>

<p>In this specification, the use of IPsec tunnel protection of
	data traffic is expected. Note that section 5.5 of <a class='info' href='#RFC3775'>[RFC3775]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Johnson, D., Perkins, C., and J. Arkko, &ldquo;Mobility Support in IPv6,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>
	only specifies that:

      </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
   For traffic tunneled via the home agent, additional IPsec ESP
   encapsulation MAY be supported and used. If multicast group
   membership control protocols or stateful address
   autoconfiguration protocols are supported, payload data
   protection MUST be supported.
</pre></div><p>

      
</p>
<p> The logic behind previous expectation is associated with the
	availability of credentials between the MN and HA, and also
	the kind of environment in which it will get deployed. 
</p>
<p> However, the lack of IPsec protection of tunneled data does
	not prevent IRO; it only removes some security advantages of
	this protection. This loss is covered in this appendix. 
</p>
<p> When negotiating IRO, the MN uses the tunnel to its HA for
	routing IKE negotiation with the peer. As IKE is designed for 
	robustness, the advantage of the privacy when IPsec is used for
	protecting the data tunnel (i.e. non NULL encryption) is the
	insurance that the address of the peer or its cryptographic
	credentials are not disclosed on MN's network. Note that MN's
	HoA and associated identity are expected to be disclosed to
	eavesdroppers during registration of the MN to its HA (if IRO
	is not extended to HA-MN exchanges to remove HAO and RH2 from
        BU/BA).
</p>
<p> As a conclusion, removing the hypothesis of privacy for data
	tunneled to the HA removes the anonymity provided to peer's
	identity (HoA or CoA, and possibly cryptographic identity
	appearing during IKE exchange).

<a name="rfc.section.E"></a><h3>Appendix E.&nbsp;
What if I don't need protection?</h3>

<p> IRO mandates the use of IPsec for all direct communications
	between MIPv6 peers. As IPsec is only a framework, the level
	of protection might vary, along with the additional
	requirements, environments and capabilities of end devices.
</p>
<p> There will certainly be some very specific and limited cases
	where people will see a need in downgrading the security for
	performance or other reasons. To be fair, except in some very
	specific conditions, achieving performance while still
	keeping security is possible. For instance, if authentication
	is a real requirement but privacy is not (but it is still
	activated by default), and CPU limits the throughput, keeping
	only authentication services of IPsec as provided by ESP with
	NULL encryption or by AH will clearly boost performance. 
</p>
<p> Now, if there is a desperate need to suppress security
	services between MIPv6 peers for some reason, the best thing
	is to use another route optimization like common RO as
	specified in <a class='info' href='#RFC3775'>[RFC3775]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Johnson, D., Perkins, C., and J. Arkko, &ldquo;Mobility Support in IPv6,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>, instead of trying to circumvent
	them. 
</p>
<p> For those with some imagination, who still think the author  
	is wrong and think about simply negotiating NULL
	authentication and NULL encryption, next paragraph might be
	worth reading.

<p> <a class='info' href='#RFC4835'>[RFC4835]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Manral, V., &ldquo;Cryptographic Algorithm Implementation Requirements for 	    Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and Authentication 	    Header (AH),&rdquo; April&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> defines mandatory-to-implement cryptographic
	algorithms for use with ESP (and AH). NULL encryption

MTU Gains</h3>

<p> Standard RO is based on the use of RH2 and HAO to explicitly
	carry the HoA of the MN, respectively as real destination or
	final source of the packet sent directly between the
	nodes:<br />
<br />
 

	</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>From MN to CN: HAO
</li>
<li>From CN to MN: RH2
</li>
<li>From MN to MN: HAO and RH2, simultaneously.
</li>
</ul><p>
      
</p>
<p> The inclusion of these explicit containers generates a loss
	of MTU. In common case, where no other specific extensions or
	options are used (to remove padding considerations), HAO and
	RH2 each consume 24 bytes. 
</p>
<p> The loss of MTU associated with those MIPv6 extension for
	direct MN-CN communications is 24 bytes. For direct MN-MN
	communications, it is 48 bytes. As an initial comparison,
	unprotected routing via the HA through an IPv6-in-IPv6 tunnel
	consumes 40 bytes. When an IPsec tunnel is used, the loss of
	MTU depends on the authentication and encryption algorithm,
	negotiation of ESN, padding requirement.
</p>
<p>As IRO has been designed to provide secure IPsec-protected
	direct communications between MIPv6 peers, it is difficult
	(and does not make that much sense) to compare the loss of MTU
	associated with IRO and the one of standard unprotected RO. In
	term of header inclusion, IRO neither use RH2 nor HAO but
	require AH or ESP. Depending on the size of ESP or AH
	header(s) and the specific type of communication (MN-MN or
	MN-CN), one route optimization type might consume more
	bandwidth than the other:<br />
<br />
 

	</p>
<ul class="text">
<li> ESP in transport mode using HMAC-SHA1-96 (required in
	    all implementation) as authentication algorithm, NULL for
	    encryption and no ESN consumes 24 bytes (with 2 bytes of
	    padding). Adding a meaningful encryption algorithm will
	    make that higher.
</li>
<li> AH in transport mode also using HMAC-SHA1-96 and no ESN
	    will give a similar value. 
</li>
</ul><p>
      
</p>
<p> To make things simple, using IRO with some ESP with NULL
	encryption or with AH for MN-CN communications provides
	similar MTU loss as standard RO. Having a meaningful
	encryption algorithm (expected) with ESP give a little
	advantage to standard RO regarding MTU loss.
</p>
<p> When considering MN-MN, IRO will clearly consumes less
	bandwidth than standard RO in all possible combinations of
	algorithms for AH or ESP. 
</p>
<p> Now, considering the same level of protection, i.e. by using
	IPsec for standard RO carried packets (we do not take into
	account padding variations), IRO simply gets a direct
	advantage: 24 bytes for MN-CN communications and 48 bytes for
	MN-MN communications. It is due to the complete removal of HAO
	and RH2 from packets exchanged directly between peers.  
</p>
<p> In fact, regarding MTU considerations, IRO provides a zero
	cost mobility service to IPsec protected connections between
	end nodes.

Compatibility with static keying</h3>

<p> IRO has been designed for enabling direct secure
	communications between MIPv6 entities belonging to a common
	trust domain. Scalability was a primary concern; This is the
	reason why the  specification covers SA negotiation under the
	hypothesis that IKE  is used for that purpose. But IRO is also
	fully compatible with static keying.
</p>
<p> In fact, the specification is not specifically bound to the
	use of either static or dynamic keying for SA setup; it is
	left as a local configuration decision to domain
	administrators. 
</p>
<p> This appendix quickly covers the differences regarding the
	use of static keying with IRO. 
</p>
<p> One great difference between static and dynamic keying is
	the removal of the IKE negotiation. For IRO, the first
	negotiation performed with the peer provides an additional
	information to the CN: a live proof of address (HoA) ownership
	by the MN. The removal of this step also removes the live
	check. This is a fact administrators should be aware of. 
</p>
<p> There should be no specific reason preventing the
	simultaneous use of static and dynamic keying with IRO.

<a name="rfc.section.H"></a><h3>Appendix H.&nbsp;
Compatibility with the use of CoA in SP/SA</h3>

<p> SP and SA are not changed at any moment by MIPv6 stack when
	IRO is used. Only incoming and outgoing IPsec packets can
	undergo source or destination address remapping.
</p>
<p> When using IRO, MIPv6 stack will only act upon IPsec traffic
      associated with SA that involve the HoA of the MN or of a remote
      IRO peers's (MN) HoA as source or	destination addresses
      (endpoints for tunnel mode SA).
</p>
<p> Outgoing IPsec packets are only possibly modified to change
	the HoA into the CoA. CoA of outgoing IPsec packets are never
	modified by MIPv6 stack, when IRO is used. 
</p>
<p> Incoming IPsec packets will have their source modified (from
	CoA to peer's MN HoA) if their are associated with a SA
	that expects the HoA of an IRO peer. This implies that no
	incoming packet with a CoA source will be modified if the
	associated SA references that CoA (and not peer's
	HoA). Regarding destination address of an incoming IPsec 
	packet, remapping of a CoA will occur if the SA expects an
	HoA. This implies that no incoming packet with a CoA
	destination will be modified if IRO remapping rules references
	that CoA (and not our HoA).
</p>
<p> As a conclusion, the work of IRO is compatible with the use
	of CoA as destination or source address (endpoint addresses
	for tunnel mode) of any SP/SA.

<a name="rfc.section.I"></a><h3>Appendix I.&nbsp;
Rationale for not specifying a new BU</h3>

<p> IRO is not designed as a fallback mode for IPsec
	communications between MIPv6 entities but as an improved
	alternative. 
</p>
<p> You cannot use IRO and common mode with the same peer. You
	either need the security advantages of IRO for communications
	with a peer or you can afford unprotected direct
	communications with it, for which common RO has been
	developed. Parallel uses of common mode and IRO mode with
	different MIPv6 entities (including its HA) is not forbidden
	but strongly discouraged as it suppresses the anonymity of the
	MN on its foreign link. 
</p>
<p> For that reasons, IRO does not come with some detection
	algorithm against peers that do not have IRO activated to
	perform a fallback to common mode. Considering the setup
	associated with the protection mechanisms required by IRO and
	the kind of environments it is expected to be used in,
	requiring that entities be configured to specifically use IRO
	for a peer (or by default, preventing the common mode) is
	required. 
</p>
<p> This has many positive impacts both on development costs,
	deployment and debugging. This notably provides the ability to
	reuse messages without creating parallel versions where
	needed. As only a few things changes when IRO is activated
	between two entities, most of the code remains usable. In
	fact, the two main changes introduced by IRO are:<br />
<br />


	</p>
<ul class="text">
<li> the removal of HAO/RH2 and the replacement by the
	    remapping process on selected IPsec traffic.
</li>
<li> a simplified registration procedure with CN (AOT*
	  framework) 
</li>
</ul><p>
	
</p>
<p> Let's go a little further. One can think that it would have
	been possible to create specific mobility options to
	discriminate IRO mode from the common mode. This was
	impossible for multiple reason. First, from a specification
	perspective, section 6.1.7 of <a class='info' href='#RFC3775'>[RFC3775]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Johnson, D., Perkins, C., and J. Arkko, &ldquo;Mobility Support in IPv6,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> requires that "The
	receiver MUST ignore and skip any options which it does not
	understand", which prevents the reuse of MIPv6 messages with a
	slightly modified semantic if peers are not aware of that. For
	options to have an interest, you have to be aware that the
	peer support it (not necessarily that it is activated). 
</p>
<p> Anyway, there is a better reason that makes the use of
	common mode and IRO mode incompatible between peers: IRO
	remapping process must be activated on the receiver for the
	packets to be valid. If a MN that uses IRO sends an IPsec
	protected Binding Update message to a peer that is not using
	IRO, no remapping will occur and the checksum will end up
	being invalid (if it passes the IPsec stack). Section 9.2 of
	<a class='info' href='#RFC3775'>[RFC3775]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Johnson, D., Perkins, C., and J. Arkko, &ldquo;Mobility Support in IPv6,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> requires the following rule to be applied to such
	packet: "The checksum must be verified as per Section
	6.1. Otherwise, the node MUST silently discard the
	message".

<a name="rfc.section.J"></a><h3>Appendix J.&nbsp;
Anonymity</h3>

<p> There are mainly 2 kinds of identifiers that can appear
	during an IPsec protected communication in IKE/MIPv6
	environments: addresses (HoA, CoA, CN addresses) and
	cryptographic identifiers (IKE credentials, i.e. X.509
	certificates). 
</p>
<p> In MN-CN communications, the addresses of the CN and the CoA
	of the MN will obviously be disclosed, but they should not be
	meaningful. We see later that in MN-MN case, the address of
	the CN that appears on the wire might temporarily be the HoA,
	before registration has been performed by the second MN. 
</p>
<p> In MIPv6, the use of explicit containers (HAO and RH2)
	makes the Home Address of the MN available in all cases. With
	IRO, the complete removal of this extensions prevents the
	disclosure of the HoA during direct MN-CN communications and
	MN-HA communications.
</p>
<p> The removal applies to:<br />
<br />


	</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>the IPsec protected signaling traffic exchanged directly
	    between the two peers (BU/BA for instance)
</li>
<li> the IPsec protected data traffic exchanged in MN-MN and
	    MN-CN cases (when tunnel mode is not already used to avoid
	    RH2/HAO). 
</li>
</ul><p>
      
</p>
<p> From the perspective of an eavesdropper on the FL of the MN,
     when IRO is used the visible exchanges that occur are (in order,
     for MN-MN case, with registrations performed on that link,
     i.e. worst case scenario):<br />
<br />


     </p>
<ul class="text">
<li> IKE negotiation between the CoA of the MN and its HA 
</li>
<li> IPsec protected BU/BA exchanges using CoA and HA@ as
	 on-wire addresses (remapping rules applied on both ends)
</li>
<li> IPsec protected (tunnel mode this time) traffic with
	 peers
</li>
<li> IKE exchange from the HoA, IPsec tunneled to the HA, with a
	 CN 
</li>
<li> Direct IPsec-protected BU/BA exchanges using the CoA and
	 the address of the the CN for on-wire addresses. 
</li>
<li> Direct IPsec-protected data traffic exchange with the CN,
	 between the CoA and the address of the CN.
</li>
</ul><p>
   
</p>
<p> In all those exchanges, the only addresses that are disclosed
     to an eavesdropper on the FL of the MN (if ESP with a meaningful
     encryption is used for all IPsec exchanges) are the CoA, the
     address of MN's HA and the address of the CN. The HoA of the MN
     never appears in those exchanges.
</p>
<p> For IKE case, even if it is used as an ID in Phase 2 for
     bootstrapping as described in <a class='info' href='#MIGRATE'>[MIGRATE]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ebalard, A. and S. Decugis, &ldquo;PF_KEY Extension as an Interface between Mobile IPv6              and IPsec/IKE,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>, the exchanges are
     encrypted and the HoA does not appear. For the negotiation with the
     CN, because the HoA is used for the exchanges, the IPsec tunnel to
     the HA protects traffic to/from the Home Network. 
</p>
<p> Regarding cryptographic identifiers, the certificate of the MN
     is not expected to appear on the wire. In all cases, the only
     information one can get are associated with the MN's Home Network
     (HA address and possibly certificate), but nothing more specific
     should be disclosed. 
</p>
<p> Now, considering the specific case of MN-MN communications, on
     the network of the initiating MN1 (the first to register with its
     peer), after the IKE negotiation as been performed relayed by both
     Home Agents, the IPsec protected Binding Update packets is emitted
     with the HoA of MN2 as destination (the address of the CN in
     previous list is the HoA of MN2). Let's consider associated SPI is 
     42. The packet is sent directly with the CoA of MN1 on the wire and
     is routed to the Home Network of the peer, before it is tunneled to
     it. The BA follows a reverse path but with a different SPI (say
     43). After the second registration is over, the MH traffic using
     those SPI values (42 and 43) flows directly (remapping rules are
     now in place on both ends). From an eavesdropper perspective on the
     FL of MN1, this provides "a clue" about the association between the
     HoA and the CoA of the second MN2. This is introduced in
     <a class='info' href='#RFC4882'>[RFC4882]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Koodli, R., &ldquo;IP Address Location Privacy and Mobile IPv6: Problem Statement,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p> Note that this is the only "leaking" that happens and only on
     the FL of the first MN. It is no more the case on FL that are visited
     later. Anyway, from the perspective of an eavesdropper monitoring
     that, the information will be that a Mobile Node from a known Home
     Network (HA@) has performed IPsec communications with a MN having a
     known HoA (no credentials).
