1) Abstract

A new URL scheme, "vemmi" is defined. It allows vemmi client software to 
connect to multimedia interactive services compliant to the VEMMI 
standard (Enhanced Man-Machine Interface for Videotex and 
Multimedia/Hypermedia Information Retrieval Services).

VEMMI is a new international standard for on-line multimedia services, 
that is both an ITU-T (International Telecommunications Union, ex.
CCITT)  International Standard (T.107) [2] and an European Standard
(ETSI European Telecommunications Standard Institute) standard
(ETS 300 382  [3], obsoleted by prETS 300 709 [1]).

VEMMI could be described as a on-line multimedia protocol describing
both the man-machine interface and the client/server exchange protocol.
VEMMI operates usually on a single continuous session between a client
and a host and supports an object-oriented, event-driven, client/server 
oriented and platform independent multimedia interface. The well-known 
port number 575 has been assigned by IANA to the VEMMI protocol.

A description of the VEMMI standard along with its last approved version 
is publicly available on the Web: see the URL
http://www.etsi.fr/etsi/vemmi/vemmi.htm). A presentation of VEMMI could 
be found on http://www.mctel.fr/VEMMI/vemmien_intro.html


------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) VEMMI URL scheme utility and operability:

- VEMMI service selection: A VEMMI multimedia server will listen on its 
  VEMMI well-known port for incoming connections. The server could of 
  course be engaged in many simultaneous connections, and after a 
  connection is established, the terminal must be able to select the 
  VEMMI application desired, as a same system may host different VEMMI 
  applications.
  The best mechanism to fully describe the VEMMI service to activate is 
  the URL mechanism.
- Reporting user action to a remote server: The VEMMI protocol 
  establishes a continuous TCP/IP link between the terminal and the 
  server during the whole user session. During a session managing VEMMI 
  objects, the user actions are usually reported back to the server 
  using the VEMMI user data report mechanism that is an integral part of 
  the VEMMI protocol.
  However, in some case, the URL mechanism may be required to send back 
  reports to a remote host. VEMMI is for example able to display HTML 
  documents within a multimedia display area in a VEMMI dialog box. 
  These HTML documents may be managed either by the VEMMI server (acting 
  as a proxy gateway) or directly by the client software that will issue 
  itself the HTTP requests on the network and browse across documents on 
  the Web as a standard Web browser (the link to the VEMMI server is 
  kept and used for interacting with other VEMMI objects and components 
  but the VEMMI server may not be informed of the user navigation on the 
  Web inside the multimedia area).
  In such a case, the URL mechanism could also be used to report the 
  user actions and commands within a HTML document to be reported to the 
  VEMMI server or even another system.
- Extension of Web browsers: The VEMMI protocol is quite complementary 
  to HTTP/HTML used by Web browsers, and several networks operators have 
  decided to support jointly Web and VEMMI (seen as complementary 
  protocols). Thanks to the VEMMI URL, Web browsers will be able to 
  activate a VEMMI client software module to start a VEMMI session to 
  the requested service when the user activate a vemmi URL included in 
  the HTML document.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Description of the VEMMI scheme

The VEMMI URL scheme is used to designate multimedia interactive
services conforming to the VEMMI standard (ITU/T T.107 and
prETS 300 709).

A VEMMI URL takes the form:
    vemmi://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<vemmiservice>;
    <attribute>=<value>

as specified in Section 3.1. of RFC 1738. If :<port> is omitted, the
port defaults to 575 (client software may choose to ignore the optional
port number in order to increase security). The :<password> may be
omitted, as well as the whole <user>:<password> part.

This URL does not designate a data object, but rather a multimedia 
interactive service. A VEMMI service start a multimedia session managing 
multimedia objects and interacting with the user during the session. To 
the difference of other stateless protocols, the link between the client 
and the server is usually maintained during the whole session (although 
in some cases other mechanisms may be used, see below).

The VEMMI remote interactive services may vary widely in their access 
control policies; in practice, the <user> and <password> supplied are 
advisory only: clients accessing a VEMMI URL merely advise the user of 
the suggested username and password, and the user could supersede them. 
The <user> and <password> fields supplied either in the URL or the by 
user will be used to answer the user and password commands received from 
the remote host after establishing the connection to the VEMMI server.
If no user and password commands are received from the remote host,
these fields will not be used. If no user name or password is supplied
and one is requested by the VEMMI server, the program interpreting the
VEMMI URL should request one from the user, proposing by default
"anonymous" as user name and the Internet e-mail address of the end user
accessing the service as password.

Such an identification mechanism using the username/password scheme is 
unsecure and is provided for backwards compatibility only. The VEMMI 
services requiring a safe identification procedure must rely on other 
alternative mechanisms (e.g. S/KEY or other).

The <vemmiservice> is the name of the VEMMI service to activate, and
will be sent in answer to the service command received from the host.
This field is not mandatory and could be omitted for example if the
remote host manages only one VEMMI service or activates a VEMMI service
by default when no service is specified. In addition, after the 
<vemmiservice>, optional attributes and values associated with the VEMMI 
service may be specified as part of the URL. When present, each 
attribute/value pair is separated from each other and from the rest of 
the URL by a ";" (semicolon). The name of the attributes and its value 


Mavrakis, Layec & Kartmann                                     Page 3

VEMMI URL Specification                                     22 Feb 1996


are separated by a "=" (equal sign). If present, these fields are used
to transmit additional data useful for service selection or to request
to perform a specific processing. For example, the $USERDATA field can
be specified to transmit additionnal user-specified data to the VEMMI 
service. These fields will be sent following the <vemmiservice> 
transmitted to the host in answer to the service command received from 
the host.

Should an error occur during VEMMI service activation, the remote host 
may inform the user by displaying the error cause. It is recommended 
that, when possible and applicable, the status code syntax described in 
HTTP [8] [9] be used to facilitate automatic processing by the client of 
the host answer during error or normal operation.

If a VEMMI client software wants to request a VEMMI object without 
establishing a continuous VEMMI session, such a request may also be 
performed using a HTTP request for the vemmi object encoded using the 
Internet media type application/vemmi (pending registration by IANA 
[10]). In the same way, HTTP could be used in some cases to exchange
data pertaining to a VEMMI session with or without setting the keep-
alive keyword in the Connection header to request a persistent
connection [9]. Protocol switching using the upgrade header field may
be used in such case to switch to vemmi protocol [9]. This possible use
of HTTP for VEMMI is not described in this document.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Proposed syntax

The proposed BNF syntax is encoded as specified in RFC 1738 [5]:

; vemmi (see ITU-T T.107 and ETSI prETS 300 709)

vemmiurl        = "vemmi://" login [ "/" vemmiservice *[ parameter ] ]
vemmiservice    = *[ uchar | "/" | "?" | ":" | "@" | "&" | "=" ]
parameter       = ";" attribute "=" value
attribute       = *[ uchar | "/" | "?" | ":" | "@" | "&" ]
value	        = *[ uchar | "/" | "?" | ":" | "@" | "&" ]

This syntax:
- allows the user to specify the remote host address by its name or 
  numeric address, along with optional login information (user and 
  password, as login = [ user [ ":" password ] "@" ] hostport). Although 
  he could selects a specific port, it is expected the information 
  providers and VEMMI software will mostly use the port number assigned 
  to VEMMI (575).
- allows him to select a specific VEMMI service if the remote host 
  manages several different VEMMI services.
- allows also to send additionnal data to the service using the 
  parameter syntax, either during the service selection phase or when 
  the user selects a vemmi hyperlink within a HTML document displayed in 
  a VEMMI multimedia area. To the difference of the params syntax used 


Mavrakis, Layec & Kartmann                                     Page 4

VEMMI URL Specification                                     22 Feb 1996


  in [4], the parameter syntax requires each value to be labelled by an 
  attribute. The parameter attribute names are case-insensitive. 
  Parameter values may or may not be case-sensitive, depending on the 
  attribute.

All the values of fieldname beginning by a dollar ($) sign are reserved 
for specific use, including:
- $COMMAND: VEMMI command to be returned to the host when the VEMMI 
  session do not use a continuous link.
- $CONTEXTDATA: context data.
- $OBJECT_REQUEST: request the retransmission of a given VEMMI object.
- $USERDATA: user data specific by the user and to be processed by the 
  VEMMI service.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) Examples:

Some examples are presented below, they are for information only:

a) A simple VEMMI URL for a VEMMI service that does not enforce access 
   control might be:
     URL: vemmi://mctel.fr/demo
   In this case, the exchange between client and server is as follow
   (server requests at the left, client answers at the right):
...establishing TCP/IP link to mctel.fr...
service:        demo
200 OK                     {status code returned by the VEMMI host}
...starting VEMMI session...

b) If the remote server hosts only one VEMMI service, this field may be 
   omitted and the URL might be:
     URL: vemmi://mctel.fr
   In this case, the VEMMI interactive session is started immediately
   by the host without requesting first the service name.

c) A similar URL to a service that requires an username and password
   might have an URL that looks like:
     URL: vemmi://smith:12345678@mctel.fr/demo
   The exchange between the client and server will be:
...establishing TCP/IP link to mctel.fr...
service:        demo
login:          smith
password:       12345678
200 OK
...starting VEMMI session...
   Should the server does not prompt the client for login and password,
   the login information stored in the URL will not be used.

d) The URL may not include the username and password. In this case,
   should they be requested by the host, the VEMMI client may use a

VEMMI URL Specification                                     22 Feb 1996

   default specified for this service or prompt the user for them (for
   example it could propose anonymous and user e-mail address as
   defaults):
     URL: vemmi://mctel.fr/demo
   In this case, the exchange between client and server may be as follow 
   (server requests at the left, client answers at the right):
...establishing TCP/IP link to mctel.fr...
service:        demo
login:          anonymous        {user has been prompted for username}
password:       mavrakis@ties.itu.ch   {user prompted for password}
401 Unauthorized                 {an anonymous user is not allowed to 
                                 access the service}
...closing TCP/IP link between client and server...

e) Some services may use additionnal data transmitted in the parameter 
   fields, for example:
     URL: vemmi://mctel.fr/demo;$USERDATA=smith;account=1234
   If no access check is done by the host, the dialog might be:
...establishing TCP/IP link to mctel.fr...
service:        demo;$USERDATA=smith;account=1234
200 OK
...starting VEMMI session...


------------------------------------------------------------------------
6)  Procedure to use when a VEMMI URL is encountered without VEMMI
    support:

The VEMMI URL support may be built in some Web browsers, or offered
by an associated software interworking with the user browser, for
example using the WWW_RegisterProtocol API command.

When a Web browser encounter a VEMMI URL without having VEMMI support, 
two cases may occur:
- some browsers will detect an unrecognized scheme and signal an error 
  directly.
- others will build a relative URL including the URL entered and will 
  request it from the host having sent the current document. In this
  case the host will usually return the error "not found".

Among the mechanisms that could be used in order to offer a friendly 
interface to both users with and without VEMMI support:
- when the second case occur and the relative URL including the
  vemmi:// string is transmitted to the server, the HTTPD server may
  be modified in order to recognize such URL and to propose the
  downloading of a VEMMI client software.
- the HTML document including the vemmi URL allowing to start the
  VEMMI session may propose both options, for example:
     If your browser supports VEMMI, directly
     <A HREF="vemmi://ares.mctel.fr/TEST">start the interactive
     multimedia service</A>, otherwise 
     <A HREF="ftp://ftp.mctel.fr/vemmi.exe">download first a VEMMI
     client software</A>.


Mavrakis, Layec & Kartmann                                     Page 6

VEMMI URL Specification                                     22 Feb 1996


- the application/vemmi MIME type is pending registration (to allow for 
  example exchange of vemmi objects). A possible way is for the server
  to look in the HTTP Accept header field and to deduce that if 
  application/vemmi is supported, then the VEMMI support exists (in this 
  case, application/vemmi is to be defined in the browser and associated 
  with the vemmi decoder).


------------------------------------------------------------------------
7) Security considerations:

The VEMMI URL scheme is subject to the same security implications as the 
general URL scheme [5], so the usual precautions outlined in [5] apply 
(for example, the use of URLs containing passwords that should be secret 
is clearly unwise).

Furthermore, among VEMMI objects that could be used during the 
interactive session, metacode objects (representing a sequence of VEMMI 
commands) and operative objects (they are executable programs to be run 
on the client platform) may be downloaded and/or started.

In order to protect the user against the activation of an harmful 
operative object, it is strongly recommended that the users use the 
configuration menu of their VEMMI software to disable the option of 
running operative objects when receiving potentially unsafe VEMMI 
objects, or at least enable the option to request first user approval 
before starting the execution of an operative object.
