                  Information Distribution over GRASP
                 draft-liu-anima-grasp-distribution-00

Abstract

   This document discusses the requirement of information distribution
   capability in autonomic networks.  Ideally, the autonomic network
   should support distributing some information which is generated/
   injected at an arbitrary autonomic node and be distributed among the
   whole autonomic domain.  This docuemnt specifically proposes to
   achive this goal based on the GRASP (A Generic Autonomic Signaling
   Protocol), and proposes relevant protocol extension to GRASP.

1.  Introduction

   The GRASP is mostly for negotiation between two nodes.  Besides
   negotiation function, there is also requirement of simply delivering
   information among nodes.  GRASP synchronirozation is defined for this
   requirement.  However, the synchronization is a very simple mechanism
   that might not fulfil all the information delivery requirements in a

   autonomic network.  So this document proposes a comprehensive
   function called "Distribution Capability" to fulfil the goals.
   Multicast/flooding behaviors are involved in distribution capability,
   but distribution capability itself doesn't simply equal to these
   behaviors.

   This document describes the requirements of distributing information/
   signal (e.g.  Autonomic Network Intent, which is discussed in
   [I-D.du-anima-an-intent] ) in an autonomic network.  Although the
   most obvious distributed information might be Intent, this document
   considers distribution capablility as a general function that the
   autonomic networks should support,rather than a specific mechanism
   dedicated for Intent.  Ideally, the information/signal may be
   generated/injected at an arbitrary autonomic node and be distributed
   among the whole autonomic domain.  This docuemnt specifically
   proposes to achive this goal based on the GRASP (A Generic Autonomic
   Signaling Protocol) [I-D.ietf-anima-grasp] , and proposes relevant
   protocol extension to GRASP.

2.  Information Distribution Scenarios

2.1.  Whole Domain Distribution

   Once the information is input to the autonomic network, the node that
   firstly handle the information MUST be able to distribute it to the
   all the other nodes in the autonomic domain.

2.2.  Selective Distribution

   The distribution only works on a specific group nodes to control
   unnecessary flooding.

2.3.  Incremental Distribution

   The distribution only goes to the nodes that newly get online.

3.  Distribution Capability Requirements

3.1.  Generic requirements

3.1.1.  Autonomic Domain Boundary

   The domain boundary devices are supposed to know themselves as
   boundary.When the distribution messages come to the devices, they do
   not distribute them outside the domain.

Internet-Draft             GRASP Distribution               October 2015


   [Editor's Notes] It is a practical issue that how an autonomic node
   recognizes itself as a domain boundary device.  It is not in the
   scope of this document.

3.1.2.  Avoiding Signaling Storm

   There should be a mechanism to prevent the distributed object to
   travel around the domain again and again, so that there would not be
   a large amout of redundant packets troubling the network.

3.1.3.  Arbitrary Injecting Point (Optional)

   The distributed object SHOULD be injected at any autonomic node
   within the domain (or within a specific group [TBD]).

3.1.4.  Confliction Handling (Optional)

   As long as it supports arbitrary point of injecting an object, there
   is possibility that two nodes advertise the same object but with
   conflict content.  Hence, there should be a mechanism to handle the
   confliction.

3.1.5.  Verification of Distributed Information

   o  Information integrity verification

         The recieving node SHOULD be able to verify whether the
         distributed information is from the certain node.  In other
         words, it needs to make sure the information hasn't been
         modified.

   o  Source authorization verification

         Even the information integrity was verified, the distibuted
         information might still be invalid, since the distribution
         source might doesn't have the right to distribute such
         information that it just exceeds its authority.

3.2.  Node Behavior

3.2.1.  Flooding

   The flooding behavior is mostly for the whole domain distribution
   scenario.

   o  Flooding to all interfaces





Liu & Jiang              Expires April 21, 2016                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft             GRASP Distribution               October 2015


      a) Flooding to all the interfaces attached to the node.  This is
         the basic requirement.  The interfaces include both phisical
         interfaces and the virtual interfaces for example the ACP
         tunnels.

      b) Besides replicating the message to all interfaces, the node
         might also replicate the message to all recorded IP addresses
         of all the other nodes.  The addresses might be got through
         some mechanisms such as routing protocol.  This L3
         communication behavior could also be seen as a flooding.  [Open
         Question] Do we need this L3 distribution feature?

   o  Loop Avoidance

         When messages are flooded off link, it is highly possible that
         the message would be flooded back to the initiator again, thus
         there would be a large amount of duplicated messages circling
         around the network.  So, there needs to be relevant mechanism
         to avoid/limit the packets loop.

3.2.2.  Selective Flooding

   In contrast to flooding, there should be selective fooding of the
   node to achieve selective distribution.

   Selective flooding means the receiving node would only replica the
   informaion to part of the interfaces.

   [Editor's Note] Details TBD.

3.2.3.  Point to Point

   To fulfil the incremental distribution, the nodes also need to
   support point to point mode.  This behavior is already included in
   current GRASP in the form of Synchronization.

3.3.  Distribution indication

   The autonomic nodes need to be able to distinguish the information
   that needs to be distributed from the other information.  Hence,
   there should be an indication signal within the messgage that carries
   the information.  This could be achieved through various ways:

   o  A new message dedicated for distribution.  The message itself
      means it needs to be distributed, the receiving nodes will
      distribute the whole messge.

Internet-Draft             GRASP Distribution               October 2015


   o  A new option dedicated for distribution. the receiving nodes might
      not need to distribute the whole messge, they could distribute the
      option in other messages they slected.

   o  An indicator such as flag in message or option.  In this case,
      every existing message or option could be extended to indicate
      distribution.

   [Open discussion] Which one is the best approach?

3.4.  Selective distribution indication

   When doing selective flooding, the node needs to be aware of which
   interfaces should be sent the distributed information and which are
   not.

   One possible way is that the chosen interfaces match a certain
   policy/rule which carried along with the distributed information.
   The nodes would parse the policy/rule and decide which interfaces to
   be flooded accordingly.

4.  Information Distribution over GRASP

   This section makes some extension to the signalling protocol to
   fulfil the distribution requirement.

4.1.  Distribution indication

4.1.1.  Candidated solution 1: Overloading current messages

   o  Initiating Node

      a) Assuming there is a distribution module running apon GRASP in
         charge of the information distribution.

      b) The distribution module calls the GRASP module to encapsulate
         the distributed information into an Option (either dedicated
         distribution option or other options that extended by a
         Distribution flag) in an Unsolicited Response Message (as
         discussed in Section 3.3.5 of [I-D.ietf-anima-grasp] ), and
         send the message to all the interfaces.

   o  Receiving Node

      a) Assuming there is an distribution module running upon GRASP in
         charge of the information distribution.

Internet-Draft             GRASP Distribution               October 2015


      b) After recieving the distributed information, The GRASP module
         relay the message to other interfaces.

      c) However, if the node is the distribution boundary, it MUST NOT
         relay the message again.

   In this case, the Response Message is overloaded for distribution
   indication, when it is an Unsolicited Response Message.  This
   solution is already covered by current [I-D.ietf-anima-grasp] .

4.1.2.  Candidated solution 2: Information Distribution Message

   Although the distribution behavior might be achieved by using current
   GRASP messages, the message overloading might add unnecessary
   complexity to the GRASP stack.

   So, a new message dedicated for information distribution might be
   better.

4.2.  Selective Distribution indication

   There needs to be new added mechanism to achieve this goal,
   regardless of which distribution indication candidate solution is
   chosen.

   Specific desigh is TBD.

4.3.  Node behavior

4.3.1.  Flooding behavior

   o  Basic behavior

         When the node receives a distributed information message/
         option, it replicates the information to all the other
         interfaces.

   o  Loop Avoidance

         There might be multiple ways to achieve this goal.  This
         document proposes two of them for discussion.

         One is as the following:

         a) The node maintains a flooding state table which stores each
            interface's record that whether a specific distributed
            message (or option) had been received or sent from it.  The

Internet-Draft             GRASP Distribution               October 2015


            identification could be the combination of the Sequence
            Number and Node ID.

         b) The node MUST NOT send a flooding message/option to the
            interfaces that had received or sent the same distributed
            information.

         The other is:

            flooding with sequence numbers for loop/duplicate avoidance

   o  Flooding TTL

         In case an message/option is occasionally looped around, the
         Flooding TTL is to guarantee the packet would not travel in a
         infinite loop in the network.

4.3.2.  Selective Flooding behavior

   TBD.

4.3.3.  Point to Point behavior

   The point to point distribution has been covered by the GRASP
   Synchronization function.

5.  Security Considerations

   The distribution source authentication could be done at multiple
   layers:

   o  Outer layer authentication: the GRASP communication is within a
      protected channel such as ACP (Autonomic Control Plane,
      [I-D.behringer-anima-autonomic-control-plane] ).

   o  Inner layer authentication: the GRASP communication might not be
      within a protected channel, then there should be embedded
      protection in distribution itself.  Public key infrastructure
      might be involved in this case.

6.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.
