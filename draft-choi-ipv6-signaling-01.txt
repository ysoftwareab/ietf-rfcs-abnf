1. Introduction 
   
  Many signaling mechanisms are defined and developed to support QoS in 
  IP networks. Those are chosen by users to satisfy their needs, 
  objectives, and implementation costs. Also most of the signaling 
  protocols are based on the underlying network structure, i.e. IP 
  networks, but they don't depend on the minor version of the network. 
  For example, one signaling protocol designed for the IPv4 network can 
  be used in IPv6 network without modifying the specification of the 
  signaling mechanism. Rather than to do like that, the signaling 
  protocol adopt itself to the different version of network 
  implementation by defining option fields like IP version information 
  field and related information like IPv4 addresses (32 bits) or IPv6 
  addresses (128 bits). 
   
  In this paper, we want to make some mechanisms to support signaling 
  protocol that is running in IPv6 network by utilizing the IPv6's 
  native features like Hop-by-Hop Option header, Routing Option header, 
  and Destination Option header as described in [RFC 2460]. Also we 
  will propose the methods those modify existing signaling protocol 
  specifications to make use of the power of IPv6 function to the 
  signaling mechanisms.  
   
  Actually, IPv6 has many features to support QoS and other 
  capabilities for the emerged networks. We will describe about that in 
  section 2. Also, those features can be used to help existing 
  signaling mechanisms or used to substitute some functions of existing 
  signaling protocols so to make the signaling protocols more fully 
  using the power of IPv6 features. 
   
  This work may not be preferred to those who won't like the 
  modification of the existing signaling protocols. Then they can use 
  the features of IPv6 to assist the existing signaling protocols 
  without modifying themselves. On the other hand, one who wants to 
  make use of the features of IPv6 signaling protocols may modify 
  slightly the existing signaling mechanisms to adopt that to the IPv6 
  networks.

2. The Needs of QoS Signaling Protocols in IPv6 networks 
   
2.1. IP related Signaling Protocols 
   
  There are already many signaling protocols in IP networks to provide 
  some control delivering mechanism with or without QoS support. We can 
  classify the signaling mechanisms regarding the actual nodes that are 
  affected by that signaling protocol. 
   
  A signaling protocol may concern with a pair of node that may be host 
  or router. Like ICMP, that kind of signaling protocol is just for the 
  information notification. On the other hand, like SIP described in 
  [RFC 2543], some signaling may be transferring the QoS related 
  information that can be used to a node to determine the control of 
  resource of the node.  
   
  There are other kinds of signaling protocols that effect on the nodes 
  on a path of source to destination path. With regarding the QoS, 
  currently RSVP [RFC 2205](or RSVP-TE [RSVP-TE 09]) and LDP[RFC 3036] 
  (or CR-LDP [CR-LDP 05]) is defined to provide QoS in intermediate 
  node of the path in the IP networks. We just use the term "IP 
  network" because any kind of sub layer mechanism can be used to 
  support the transport of IP packets.  
   
  Other signaling protocols are defined between the neighbors those are 
  connected with link. We will not mention about this case because this 
  case is treated with special case of above two cases. 
  We will regard the signaling protocols that use IP or higher layer 
  and related with QoS mechanisms. 
   
   
2.2. The Features of QoS related Signaling Protocols in IPv6 Networks 
   
  We will choose some existing signaling protocols to explain our idea. 
  To validate the further discussion, we must describe the features of 
  signaling mechanisms in IPv6 network with supporting QoS. 
   
  o  QoS parameters 
   
  Information with QoS controlling is important context of signaling 
  packet. With aggregated flow concept, IPv6 signaling mechanisms can 
  provide finer QoS granularity than DiffServ model, and more scalable 
  than IntServ model.  
   
  o  Resource Reservation 
   
  The key role of signaling protocol is to allocate and reserve the 
  network resource for the purpose of meeting end-to-end QoS 
  requirements along the entire path. The signaling protocol MUST be 
  able to deal with such resource allocation requests.

Internet Draft    The Features of IPv6 Signaling          February 2002 
 
 
  o  Priority Flow Control 
   
  Each node has many flows with different priority of various data 
  rates and QoS requirements. These flows are classified and scheduled 
  with the capability of making intelligent decisions on how resource 
  allocation SHOULD be controlled.  
   
  o  Explicit route 
   
  In IPv6 specification, there is a route extension header to use 
  explicit route. Explicit route is important for traffic engineering 
  in IPv6 networks, so we can use of this option header. In doing so, 
  signaling packet specify the route with route extension header and 
  data packet is just switched according to flow label in each router 
  on the path specified with signaling packet. There is already ROUTE 
  object in RSVP-TE specification [RSVP-TE 09]. In the case of CR-LDP, 
  some TLVs are defined to be used for this purpose. 
   
  o  Scalability 
   
  The performance of the signaling protocol SHOULD not largely depend 
  on the scale of the network to which IPv6 is applied (e.g. the number 
  of nodes, the number of physical links etc). The signaling function 
  SHOULD keep constant performance as much as possible regardless of 
  network size. Aggregating flows can reduce resource allocation and 
  runtime management overhead.  
   
  o  Flow Label Information Distribution 
   
  To make use of flow label field as mentioned in [IPNGLS 00] and 
  identify the flow label between the routers on specific path, label-
  binding information SHOULD be delivered between the related routers. 
  The related routers are on the path of the flow. 
  Label value is only meaningful between a pair of routers. And the 
  label value is predetermined before forwarding data packet along the 
  path. 
   
  o  Label Stacking 
   
  In [IPNGLS 00], label stacking concept is addressed. To enable the 
  label stacking, the signaling protocol is defined to notify the 
  stacking information. But we don't consider the concept in this 
  version.

2.3. QoS related Signaling Protocol 
 
  Usually the QoS mechanisms are supported in the IP layer or the 
  Transport layer (for example, TCP or UDP). To simplify the discussion, 
  we will just regard the three signaling protocols, RSVP-TE, CR-LDP, 
  SIP. These signaling protocols are covering the classification in 
  section 2.1 and also these signaling mechanisms can be used for the 
  some or all of QoS supporting features described in 2.2. Also we note 
  that these are running on the IP and TCP (UDP) layer. 
  We will explain these signaling protocols as briefly as possible to 
  make our discussion further. 
   
  o  RSVP-TE 
   
  RSVP-TE, originated by RSVP is used for the IntServ model described 
  in []. Both RSVP and RSVP-TE are implemented on the IP layer. RSVP is 
  defined to support QoS in IP network with fine granularity, but this 
  leads the scalability problems. RSVP-TE has some additional concepts, 
  like label distribution, aggregated flow, and explicit route. But 
  RSVP-TE doesn't support multicasting environment. 
   
  o  CR-LDP 
   
  CR-LDP, from LDP, is used for the almost same purpose of RSVP-TE. But 
  this signaling protocol use the TCP (and UDP) layer instead of IP 
  layer in RSVP-TE. So this signaling protocol uses the features of TCP 
  protocol.  
   
  o  SIP 
   
  To provide the multimedia services, like voice or moving pictures, 
  SIP and other protocols are defined to provide the server and client 
  side QoS mechanism. This protocol use ether TCP or UDP. 
   
   
2.4 The Needs of QoS Signaling Protocol in IPv6 Networks 
   
  We cannot predict the deployment step of IPv6 in real environment. 
  But we can assume that the mobile access network is the major 
  application of IPv6. This is mainly due to the large address space of 
  IPv6. Also we can predict that the large percentile of packets in 
  that network will be carried real time traffic such as voice or video.  
  It is worth to lay emphasis on these applications will heavily depend 
  on the QoS mechanism in IPv6 networks.  
   
  On the other hand, as mentioned in section 2.2, there are some 
  studies about the make use of flow label field to treat it as a "tag" 
  of packets QoS attribute and packet switching information. So there 
  MUST be signaling mechanism to distribute the flow label information 
  between the routers.

  In the actual relationship of signaling protocols and IPv6 
  specifications, we can use the features of IPv6 like Hop-by-Hop 
  Option header or Destination Option header to assist the signaling. 
  It can improve the efficiency of IPv6 networks and we can enjoy that 
  without modifying the existing signaling protocols. 
   
  We also use the IPv6 features like Routing Option header to extract 
  the routing information in signaling protocols. This mechanism should 
  be implemented to leave the use of this option to the user. But if 
  someone uses this kind of functions, he or she may have benefit of 
  consistency in the information that may be duplicated in the original 
  implementation.

3. IPv6 Assists the Existing Signaling Protocols 
   
  In this section, we will describe the methods of assisting existing 
  signaling protocols in IPv6 networks via using IPv6 extension headers. 
  The use of these methods in existing signaling protocols is discussed 
  in the last of this section. 
   
   
3.1. Using Router Alert Option 
   
  Router alert option [RFC 2711] within the IPv6 Hop-by-Hop option 
  header has the semantic "routers should examine the datagram more 
  closely". Using this option, IPv6 datagram containing signaling 
  messages are indicated and taken actions. 
   
  The router alert option has the following format: 
   
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
  |0 0 0|0 0 1 0 1|0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0|        Value (2 octets)       | 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
                     length = 2 
   
  The first three bits of the first byte are zero and the value 5 in 
  the remaining five bits is the Hop-by-Hop Option Type number. 
  [RFC 2460] specifies the meaning of the first three bits.  By   
  zeroing all three, this specification requires that nodes not   
  recognizing this option type should skip over this option and 
  continues processing the header and that the option must not change 
  en route. 
   
  There MUST only be one option of this type, regardless of value, 
  per Hop-by-Hop header. 
   
      Value:  A 2 octets code in network byte order with the following 
      values 
   
        0        Datagram contains a Multicast Listener Discovery 
                 message [RFC 2710]. 
        1        Datagram contains RSVP message. 
        2        Datagram contains an Active Networks message. 
        3-65535  Reserved to IANA for future use. 
   
  Alignment requirement: 2n+0 
   
  Values are registered and maintained by the IANA.   
   
  We suggest the new value (= 3) for RSVP-TE messages. The value 3 is 
  REQUIRED the approval of IETF and SHOULD be assigned by IANA. Other 
  signaling messages MAY be added. In this case, the value for new 
  signaling message SHOULD be assigned by IANA.

Internet Draft    The Features of IPv6 Signaling          February 2002 
 
 
  The described method has some advantages and disadvantages. It is not 
  necessary to implement the new protocol for signaling. The existing 
  signaling message is used without change. However, all IPv6 datagram 
  containing a signaling message MUST contain this option within the 
  IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Option Header of such datagram. The additional option 
  header is redundant. 
   
   
3.2. Using Internet Signaling Message Protocol (ISMP) 
   
  We propose the new protocol, Internet Signaling Message Protocol 
  (ISMP), such like the ICMPv6 [RFC 2463]. ISMP is used to carry 
  signaling messages. Every ISMP message is preceded by an IPv6 header 
  or by more IPv6 extension headers. The ISMP message is identified by 
  a Next Header value in the immediately preceding header. 
   
  The ISMP messages have the following general format: 
   
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
  |Version| Traffic Class |           Flow Label                  | 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
  |         Payload Length        |  Next Header  |   Hop Limit   | 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
  |                                                               | 
  +                                                               + 
  |                                                               | 
  +                         Source Address                        + 
  |                                                               | 
  +                                                               + 
  |                                                               | 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
  |                                                               | 
  +                                                               + 
  |                                                               | 
  +                      Destination Address                      + 
  |                                                               | 
  +                                                               + 
  |                                                               | 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
  +                                                               + 
  |                      ISMP Message Body                        |

      Payload Length       16-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the IPv6         
                           payload, i.e., the rest of the packet 
                           following this IPv6 header, in octets 
       
      Next Header          8-bit selector.  Identifies the type of 
                           signaling message immediately following the 
                           IPv6 header. Uses the same values as the 
                           IPv4 Protocol field [RFC 1700 et seq.]. 
       
      Hop Limit            8-bit unsigned integer.  Decremented by 1 by 
                           each node that forwards the packet. The 
                           packet is discarded if Hop Limit is 
                           decremented to zero. 
       
      Source Address       128-bit address of the originator of the 
                           packet. 
       
      Destination Address  128-bit address of the intended recipient of 
                           the packet (possibly not the ultimate 
                           recipient, if a Routing header is present).   
   
   
  For this method, we MUST assign the new Next Header value of IPv6 
  header. Currently, RSVP is already assigned the value 46 decimal in 
  [RFC 1700].  
   
  For example, if the Next Header value of IPv6 header is 46 decimal 
  the following ISMP message is RSVP message. The Next Header value of 
  other unassigned signaling messages SHOULD be assigned by IANA.  
   
  This second method may be used for the signaling protocols which are 
  running on the IP layer.  
   
  Compared with the method using router alert option, this method is 
  very simple because of no additional extension header. Therefore, the 
  complexity of processing is reduced but this new function MUST be 
  implemented within IPv6 header.  
   
   
3.3. The Use of Assisting Methods in Existing Signaling Protocols 
   
  In the case of RSVP-TE, if the header of a packet is indicating "This 
  packet carries the signaling information." then the intermediate 
  routers and the end host can make different treatment on just only 
  look at the IP header. 
   
  On the other hand, like CR-LDP, the protocol running on the TCP(UDP) 
  layer may also make use of the benefit that IP header already notify 
  the existence of signaling information in the payload of IP packet. 
  Originally in the CR-LDP protocol, the signaling information is 
  transferred along the path per hop. If a router sees the notification

Internet Draft    The Features of IPv6 Signaling          February 2002 
 
 
  of signaling information in the IP header, it can forward the 
  signaling packet and processing the signaling information 
  simultaneously. So the forwarding direction of packet can be done 
  faster than old mechanisms.  
   
  Lastly, the signaling protocols, like SIP, that are used for end-to-
  end path may use the option TLVs to indicate the presence of the 
  signaling information. We already know that the real-time service 
  cannot be served without support of intermediate node. If some end-
  to-end sessions are need to be guaranteed to their perceived QoS, the 
  intermediate nodes those are on the path may use the information to 
  do something related with QoS implicitly. 
   
   
   
4. Signaling Protocols Use the Features of IPv6 
   
  We focus on the features of IPv6 protocol related with the Routing 
  Option header. Like RSVP-TE and CR-LDP, QoS signaling may have 
  explicit routing information. But IPv6 also defines the Routing 
  Option header that indicates the route that the packet must be passed. 
   
  If the same information is located in two points with same packet, 
  the consistency problem may be arisen. Also the duplication of the 
  information is clearly redundancy. So we should define the field that 
  indicates the use of Routing Option header to route of the packet 
  must be passed. And the explicit route information in the payload of 
  the packet can be omitted. Then the packet can make use of IPv6 
  Routing Option header processing modules on the router and the 
  processing time can be reduced than that of the signaling protocol 
  processor.  
   
  Of course the little modification is required both the source node 
  and intermediate nodes. On the other hand, someone still use the 
  signaling without modifying that. So we propose the TVL option to 
  determine the use of this method. 
   
   
4.1. Implementation of the Notification  
   
  To notify the information that a packet use the IPv6 Routing Header 
  option to specify its route is  
   
  i) by defining the new version of RSVP-TE and CR-LDP, namely RSVP-TE-
  IPv6 and CR-LDP-IPv6 and assign new protocol number used for 
  signaling protocol indication information described in section 3. 
   
  ii) by defining additional TLV to indicate that the signaling 
  protocol use the Routing Option header to specify the explicit route 
  information. We propose a TLV in Hop-by-Hop option header to do this.

  The first three bits of the first byte are zero that the meaning of 
  this value is described in section 3.1.  
   
  There MUST only be one option of this type, regardless of value, 
  per Hop-by-Hop header. So we do not consider the case that a packet 
  carries more than one signaling protocol, i.e. RSVP-TE and CR-LDP. 
   
      Value:  A 2 octets code in network byte order with the following 
      values 
   
        0        The signaling information in this packet does not 
                 depend on the Routing Option header may exist in this 
                 header. 
        1        The signaling information in this packet makes use of 
                 Routing Option header to specify the explicit route of 
                 this packet. 
   
  Alignment requirement: 2n+0 
   
   
   
4.2. The Modification in Existing Signaling Protocols 
   
  The routers running on IPv6 networks MUST follow the specification of 
  IPv6 protocol. So they examine the Hop-by-Hop Option header and 
  determine the treatment of the packet related with the Routing Option 
  header. If a packet want to use the Routing Option header to specify 
  it's explicit route :  
   
  o  In the case of RSVP-TE  
  For the PATH message, the routers on the path SHOULD use the route 
  information in Routing Option header of the signaling packet and 
  maintain the flow state information with the hop information of the 
  message was sent. It is used for the RESV message to be sent reverse 
  direction that the PATH message was sent. The actual forwarding of 
  PATH message is done in IPv6 router automatically. 
   
  o  In the case of CR-LDP  
  If a node send Label Request message, the routers on the path don't 
  need to record the node that send the message. Instead of that, the 
  end node SHOULD reverse information of the message was transferred, 
  i.e. the addresses of Routing Option header. Then the end node makes 
  the Routing Option header exactly reverse of the route before send 
  the Label Reply message.

5. Other Issues 
   
   
  The problems arise from the tunneling such like mobile IPv6 
  mechanisms are not fully exploited in this version of document. Also 
  the more detail procedure of signaling packet processing in CR-LDP 
  and RSVP-TE in case of the explicit route information is carried in 
  Routing Option header should be considered. We are studying about 
  these issues.  
   
   
6. IANA Considerations 
   
  The value field described in Section 3 SHOULD be registered and 
  maintained by IANA. The New values SHOULD be to be assigned via IETF 
  Consensus as defined in [RFC 2434]. 
   
   
7. Security Considerations 
   
  This document does not have any security concerns. The security 
  requirements using this document are described in the referenced 
  documents.
