<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>One fundamental aspect of any IP communications infrastructure 
  is its addressing plan. With its new address architecture and allocation 
  policies, the introduction of IPv6 into a network means that network 
  designers and operators need to reconsider their existing
  approaches to network addressing.  Lack of guidelines on handling 
  this aspect of network design could slow down the deployment and
  integration of IPv6.  This draft aims to provide the information and
  recommendations relevant to planning the addressing aspects of IPv6 
  deployments.  The draft also provides IPv6 addressing case studies for 
  both an enterprise and an ISP network.

Introduction</h3>

<p>The Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Addressing Architecture
   <a class='info' href='#RFC4291'>[RFC4291]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hinden, R. and S. Deering, &ldquo;IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> defines three main types of addresses: unicast, 
   anycast and multicast.  This document focuses on unicast addresses, for which there
   are currently two principal allocated types: Global Unique Addresses <a class='info' href='#RFC3587'>[RFC3587]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hinden, R., Deering, S., and E. Nordmark, &ldquo;IPv6 Global Unicast Address Format,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> 
   ('globals') and Unique Local IPv6 Addresses <a class='info' href='#RFC4193'>[RFC4193]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hinden, R. and B. Haberman, &ldquo;Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> (ULAs).
   In addition until recently there has been 'experimental' 6bone address 
   space <a class='info' href='#RFC2471'>[RFC2471]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hinden, R., Fink, R., and J. Postel, &ldquo;IPv6 Testing Address Allocation,&rdquo; December&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a>, though its use has been 
   deprecated since June 2006 <a class='info' href='#RFC3701'>[RFC3701]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Fink, R. and R. Hinden, &ldquo;6bone (IPv6 Testing Address Allocation) Phaseout,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>.
   
</p>
<p>The document covers aspects that should be
   considered during IPv6 deployment for the design and planning of an 
   addressing scheme for an IPv6 network. 
   The network's IPv6 addressing plan may be for an IPv6-only network, or for
   a dual-stack infrastructure where some or all devices have addresses
   in both protocols.
   These considerations will help an IPv6 network
   designer to efficiently and prudently assign the IPv6 address space that
   has been allocated to their organization.
   
</p>
<p>The address assignment considerations are analyzed separately for the 
   two major components of the IPv6 unicast addresses, namely 'Network 
   Level Addressing' (the allocation of subnets)
   and the 'Subnet Prefix' (address usage within a subnet).  Thus
   the document includes a discussion of aspects of address assignment 
   to nodes and interfaces in an IPv6 network. Finally the document 
   provides two examples of successfully deployed address plans in 
   a service provider (ISP) and an enterprise network.
   
</p>
<p>
   Parts of this document highlight the differences that an experienced
   IPv4 network designer should consider when planning an IPv6 deployment,
   for example:
   
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>IPv6 devices will more likely be multi-addressed in comparison with their IPv4
   counterparts
</li>
<li>The practically unlimited size of an IPv6 subnet (2^64 bits) reduces
   the requirement to size subnets to device counts for the purposes of
   (IPv4) address conservation
</li>
<li>Even though there is no broadcast for the IPv6 protocol, there is still 
   need to consider the number of devices in a given subnet due to traffic 
   storm and level of traffic generated by hosts
   
</li>
<li>
   The implications of the vastly increased subnet size on the threat of 
   address-based host scanning and other scanning techniques,
   as discussed in <a class='info' href='#reference1'>[reference1]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Chown, T., &ldquo;IPv6 Implications for TCP/UDP Port Scanning (draft-ietf-v6ops-scanning-implications-00.txt),&rdquo; June&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>.   
   
</li>
</ul>
<p>
   We do not discuss here how a site or ISP should proceed with acquiring
   its globally routable IPv6 address prefix.   However, one should note that
   IPv6 networks currently 
   receive their global unicast address allocation from their
   'upstream' provider, which may be another ISP, a Local Internet Registry
   (LIR) or a Regional Internet Registry (RIR).   In each case the prefix
   received is provider assigned (PA).  Until very recently there has been
   no provider independent (PI) address space for IPv6 generally 
   available.  However ARIN is now piloting PI address space allocations, 
   subject to customers meeting certain requirements.   
   
</p>
<p>We do not discuss PI policy here.   The observations and recommendations
   of this text are largely independent of the PA or PI nature of the address
   block being used.   At this time we assume that
   most commonly an IPv6 network which changes provider
   will need to undergo a renumbering process, as described in 
   <a class='info' href='#RFC4192'>[RFC4192]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Baker, F., Lear, E., and R. Droms, &ldquo;Procedures for Renumbering an IPv6 Network without a Flag Day,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>.
   A separate document <a class='info' href='#THINKABOUT'>[THINKABOUT]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Chown, T., Thompson, M., Ford, A., and S. Venaas, &ldquo;Things to think about when Renumbering an IPv6 network (draft-chown-v6ops-renumber-thinkabout-05.txt),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> makes recommendations to 
   ease the IPv6 renumbering process. 
   
</p>
<p>
   This document does not discuss implementation aspects related to the transition 
   between the ULA addresses and the now obsoleted site-local addresses. 
   Most implementations know about Site-local addresses even though they are 
   deprecated, and do not know about ULAs - even though they represent current 
   specification. As result transitioning between these types of addresses 
   may cause difficulties.

Network Level Addressing Design Considerations</h3>

<p>This section discusses the kind of IPv6 addresses used at the 
  network level for the IPv6 infrastructure. The kind of addresses that 
  can be considered are Global Unique Addresses and ULAs.   We also comment
  here on the recently deprecated 6bone address space.

<a name="rfc.section.2.1"></a><h3>2.1.&nbsp;
Global Unique Addresses</h3>

<p>The most commonly used unicast addresses will be Global Unique
    Addresses ('globals').
    No significant considerations are necessary if the organization has an
 address 
    space assignment and a single prefix is deployed through a single upstream
    provider.
   
</p>
<p>
   However, a multihomed site may deploy addresses from
  two or 
    more Service Provider assigned IPv6 address ranges.  Here, the 
   network Administrator must 
    have awareness on where and how these ranges are used on the 
    multihomed infrastructure environment.   The nature of the usage of
    multiple prefixes may depend on the reason for multihoming (e.g.
   resilience failover, load balancing, policy-based routing, or multihoming
  during an IPv6 renumbering event).   IPv6 introduces improved support
  for multi-addressed hosts through the IPv6 default address selection
  methods described in RFC3484 <a class='info' href='#RFC3484'>[RFC3484]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Draves, R., &ldquo;Default Address Selection for Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>.  A multihomed
  host may thus have two addresses, one per prefix (provider), and select

<a name="rfc.section.2.2"></a><h3>2.2.&nbsp;
Unique Local IPv6 Addresses</h3>

<p>ULAs have replaced the originally conceived Site Local addresses 
   in the IPv6 addressing architecture, for reasons described in 
   <a class='info' href='#RFC3879'>[RFC3879]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Huitema, C. and B. Carpenter, &ldquo;Deprecating Site Local Addresses,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>.  
   ULAs improve on site locals by offering a high
   probability of the global uniqueness of the prefix used, which can
   be beneficial in the case of (deliberate or accidental) leakage, or where 
      networks are merged. ULAs are akin to the private address 
   space <a class='info' href='#RFC1918'>[RFC1918]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rekhter, Y., Moskowitz, R., Karrenberg, D., Groot, G., and E. Lear, &ldquo;Address Allocation for Private Internets,&rdquo; February&nbsp;1996.</span><span>)</span></a> assigned for IPv4 networks, except
   that in IPv6 networks we may expect to see ULAs used alongside global
   addresses, with ULAs used internally and globals used externally.
   Thus use of ULAs does not imply use of NAT for IPv6.
   
</p>
<p>The ULA address range allows network administrators to deploy 
    IPv6 addresses on their network without asking for a globally 
    unique registered IPv6 address range.  A ULA prefix
    is 48 bits, i.e. a /48, the same as the currently recommended allocation
    for a site from the globally routable IPv6 address 
    space <a class='info' href='#RFC3177'>[RFC3177]<span> (</span><span class='info'>IAB and IESG, &ldquo;IAB/IESG Recommendations on IPv6 Address Allocations to Sites,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>ULAs provide the means to deploy a fixed addressing
    scheme that is not affected by a change in service provider and 
    the corresponding PA global addresses. Internal operation of the network is thus unaffected 
    during renumbering events. Nevertheless, this type of address must be used 
    with caution. 
    
</p>
<p>A site using ULAs may or may not also deploy globals.  In an isolated
    network ULAs may be deployed on their own.   In a connected network, 
    that also deploys global addresses, both may be deployed, such that
    hosts become multiaddressed (one global and one ULA address) and
    the IPv6 default address selection algorithm will pick the appropriate
    source and destination addresses to use, e.g. ULAs will be selected where
    both the source and destination hosts have ULA addresses.  Because
    a ULA and a global site prefix are both /48 length, an administrator 
    can choose to use the same subnetting (and host addressing) plan for 
    both prefixes.
    
</p>
<p>As an example of the problems ULAs may cause, 
    when using IPv6 multicast within the network,  
    the IPv6 default address selection algorithm 
    prefers the ULA address as the source address for the 
    IPv6 multicast streams. This is NOT a valid option when sending
    an IPv6 multicast stream to the IPv6 Internet for two reasons.  
    For one, these addresses are not globally routable so RPF checks
    for such traffic will fail outside the internal network.  The other
    reason is that the traffic will likely not cross the network 
    boundary due to multicast domain control and perimeter security policies.
    
</p>
<p>In principle ULAs allow easier network mergers than RFC1918
    addresses do for IPv4 because ULA prefixes have a
    high probability of uniqueness, if the prefix is chosen as described
    in the RFC.
    
</p>
<p>
    The usage of ULAs should be carefully considered even when not 
    attached to the IPv6 Internet due to the potential for added 
    complexity when connecting to the Internet at some point in the 
    future.

Network Level Design Considerations</h3>

<p>IPv6 provides network administrators with a significantly larger 
    address space, enabling them to be very creative in how they can define 
    logical and practical address plans.  The subnetting of 
    assigned prefixes can 
    be done based on various logical schemes that involve factors such as:

        </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Geographical Boundaries - by assigning a common prefix to all
          subnets within a geographical area
          
</li>
<li>Organizational Boundaries - by assigning a common prefix to an
          entire organization or group within a corporate infrastructure
          
</li>
<li>Service Type - by reserving certain prefixes for predefined 
          services such as: VoIP, Content Distribution, wireless services, 
          Internet Access, etc
          
</li>
</ul><p>
 
    Such logical addressing plans have the potential to simplify network operations 
    and service offerings, and to simplify network management and troubleshooting. 
    A very large network would also have no need to consider using private
    address space for its infrastructure devices, simplifying network
    management.
    
</p>
<p>The network designer must however keep in mind several factors when developing
    these new addressing schemes:

        </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Prefix Aggregation - The larger IPv6 addresses can lead to larger
          routing tables unless network designers are actively pursuing aggregation.
          While prefix aggregation will be enforced by the service provider, it is
          beneficial for the individual organizations to observe the same principles
          in their network design process
          
</li>
<li>Network growth - The allocation mechanism for 
          flexible growth of a network prefix, documented in RFC3531 
          <a class='info' href='#RFC3531'>[RFC3531]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Blanchet, M., &ldquo;A Flexible Method for Managing the Assignment of Bits of an IPv6 Address Block,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> can be used to allow the network 
          infrastructure to grow and be numbered in a way that is likely
          to preserve aggregation (the plan leaves 'holes' for growth)
          
</li>
<li>ULA usage in large networks - Networks which have a large 
          number of 'sites' that each deploy a ULA prefix which will by
          default be a 'random' /48 under fc00::/7 will have no aggregation
          of those prefixes.  Thus the end result may be cumbersome 
          because the network will have large amounts of non-aggregated 
          ULA prefixes. However, there is no rule to disallow large networks
          to use a single ULA for all 'sites', as a ULA still provides 16 bits 
          for subnetting to be used internally

Sizing the Network Allocation</h3>

<p>We do not discuss here how a network designer sizes their
      application for address space.   By default a site will receive
      a /48 prefix <a class='info' href='#RFC3177'>[RFC3177]<span> (</span><span class='info'>IAB and IESG, &ldquo;IAB/IESG Recommendations on IPv6 Address Allocations to Sites,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>.   The default provider

      These allocations are indicators for a first allocation for a 
      network. Different sizes may be obtained based on the anticipated 
      address usage <a class='info' href='#reference2'>[reference2]<span> (</span><span class='info'>APNIC, ARIN, RIPE NCC, &ldquo;IPv6 Address Allocation and Assignment Policy (www.ripe.net/ripe/docs/ipv6policy.html),&rdquo; January&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>.   There are examples of

Address Space Conservation</h3>

      lead to significant numbers of addresses being unused. Address conservation
      requirements are less stringent in IPv6 but they should still be observed.

Considerations for subnet prefixes shorter then /64</h3>

<p>An allocation of a prefix shorter then 64 bits to a node or 
   interface is bad practice.  The shortest subnet prefix that could
   theoretically be assigned to an interface or node is limited by the
   size of the network prefix allocated to the organization.
   
</p>
<p>A possible reason for choosing  the subnet prefix for an 
    interface shorter then /64 is that it would allow more nodes to 
    be attached to that interface compared to a prescribed length of 64 bits. 
    This however is unnecessary considering that 2^64 provides 
    plenty of node addresses for a well designed IPv6 network. Layer two 
    technologies are unlikely to support such large numbers of nodes within 
    a single link (e.g. Ethernet limited to 48-bits of hosts)
    
</p>
<p> The subnet prefix assignments can be made
   either by manual configuration, by a stateful Host
   Configuration Protocol <a class='info' href='#RFC3315'>[RFC3315]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Droms, R., Bound, J., Volz, B., Lemon, T., Perkins, C., and M.

Considerations for subnet prefixes longer then /64</h3>

<p>Address space conservation is the main motivation for using a subnet prefix
     length longer than 64 bits.
     
</p>
<p>The address assignment can be made either by manual
     configuration or by a stateful Host Configuration Protocol <a class='info' href='#RFC3315'>[RFC3315]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Droms, R., Bound, J., Volz, B., Lemon, T., Perkins, C., and M.

</p>
<p>When assigning a subnet prefix of more then 80 bits, according to
     RFC4291 <a class='info' href='#RFC4291'>[RFC4291]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hinden, R. and S. Deering, &ldquo;IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> "u" and "g" bits (respectively the 81st and 82nd bit) need to
     be taken into consideration and should be set correctly.  In currently
     implemented IPv6 protocol stacks, the relevance of the "u"
     (universal/local) bit and "g" (the individual/group) bit are marginal
     and typically will not show an issue when configured wrongly, however
     future implementations may turn out differently.
     
</p>
<p>When using subnet lengths longer then 64 bits, it is important to
     avoid selecting addresses that may have a predefined use and could
     confuse IPv6 protocol stacks.  The alternate usage may not be
     a simple unicast address in all cases.  The following points should be 
     considered when selecting a subnet length longer then 64 bits.

      highest 128 interface identifier values are reserved for assignment 
      as subnet anycast addresses.
      
</p>
<p>The construction of a reserved subnet anycast address depends on the
      type of IPv6 addresses used within the subnet, as indicated by the
      format prefix in the addresses.
      
</p>
<p>The first type of Subnet Anycast addresses have been defined
      as follows for EUI-64 format:
      
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

 +------------------------------+------------------+------------+
 |        subnet prefix         | 1111110111...111 | anycast ID |
 +------------------------------+------------------+------------+

</pre></div>
<p>The anycast address structure implies that it is important to avoid 
      creating a subnet prefix where the bits 65 to 121 are 
      defined as "1111110111...111" (57 bits in total) so that confusion can be
      avoided.
      
</p>
<p>For other IPv6 address types (that is, with format prefixes other
      than those listed above), the interface identifier is not in EUI-64
      format and may be other than 64 bits in length; these reserved subnet
      anycast addresses for such address types are constructed as follows:
      
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

 |           n bits             |    121-n bits    |   7 bits   |

                                |   interface identifier field  |

</pre></div>
<p>In the case discussed above there is no additional dependency for

      address are 128 bits, it is not possible to have the complete IPv6 address of 
      the multicast RP embedded as such.
      
</p>
<p>This resulted in a restriction of 15 possible RP-addresses per 
      prefix that can be used with embedded-RP. The space assigned for the embedded-RP

 Cryptographically Generated IPv6 Addresses</h3>

<p>Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs) are based upon

</p>
<p>The basic idea is to generate
    the interface identifier (i.e. the rightmost 64 bits) of the IPv6
    address by computing a cryptographic hash of the public key.  The
    resulting IPv6 address is called a cryptographically generated
    address (CGA).  The corresponding private key can then be used to
    sign messages sent from that address.  
    
</p>
<p>Implications to be aware of when using CGA addresses are found in 
    section 7 of RFC3972 <a class='info' href='#RFC3972'>[RFC3972]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Aura, T., &ldquo;Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>When using CGA addresses the values of the "u" and "g" bits are ignored

Manual/Dynamic Assignment Option</h3>

<p>This section discusses those IID allocations that are not implemented through
     stateless address configuration (Section 4.1). They are applicable regardless of the prefix
     length used on the link. It is out of scope for this section to
     discuss the various assignment methods (e.g. manual configuration,
     DHCPv6, etc).
     
</p>
<p>In this situation the actual allocation is done by human intervention
     and consideration needs to be given to the complete IPv6 address so that it does not 
     result in overlaps with any of the well known IPv6 addresses:

<p>When using an address assigned by human intervention it is recommended to
    choose IPv6 addresses which are not obvious to guess and/or avoid any IPv6 addresses 
    that embed IPv4 addresses used in the current infrastructure. Following these two 
    recommendations will make it more difficult for malicious third parties
   to guess targets for attack, and thus reduce security threats to a certain extent.

Enterprise Considerations</h3>

<p>In this section we consider a case study of a campus network that
    is deploying IPv6 in parallel with  existing IPv4 protocols in a
   dual-stack environment.  The specific example is the University of
   Southampton (UK), focusing on a large department within that network.   
   The deployment currently spans around 1,000 hosts and over 1,500 users.

<a name="rfc.section.5.1.1"></a><h3>5.1.1.&nbsp;
Obtaining general IPv6 network prefixes</h3>

<p>
    In the case of a campus network, the site will typically take its
    connectivity from its National Research and Education Network (NREN).
    Southampton connects to JANET, the UK academic network, via its
    local regional network LeNSE.  JANET 
    currently has a /32 allocation from RIPE of 2001:630::/32.  The
    current recommended practice is for sites to receive a /48 allocation,
    and on this basis Southampton has received such a prefix for its
    own use, specifically 2001:630:d0::/48.   The regional network also
    uses its own allocation from the NREN provider.
    
</p>
<p>
    No ULA addressing is used on site.   The campus is not multihomed (JANET
    is the sole provider), nor does it expect to
    change service provider, and thus does not plan to use ULAs for the
    (perceived) benefit of easing network renumbering.  Indeed, the
    campus has renumbered following the aforementioned renumbering
    procedure <a class='info' href='#RFC4192'>[RFC4192]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Baker, F., Lear, E., and R. Droms, &ldquo;Procedures for Renumbering an IPv6 Network without a Flag Day,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> on two
    occasions, and this has proven adequate (with provisos documented
    in <a class='info' href='#THINKABOUT'>[THINKABOUT]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Chown, T., Thompson, M., Ford, A., and S. Venaas, &ldquo;Things to think about when Renumbering an IPv6 network (draft-chown-v6ops-renumber-thinkabout-05.txt),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.   We also do not see any need to deploy 
    ULAs for in or out of band network management; there are enough IPv6
    prefixes available in the site allocation for the infrastructure.
    In some cases, use of private IP address space in IPv4 creates problems,
    so we believe that the availability of ample global IPv6 address space 
    for infrastructure may be a benefit for many sites.   
    
</p>
<p>
    No 6bone addressing is used on site any more.  
    We note that since the 6bone phaseout of June 2006 <a class='info' href='#RFC3701'>[RFC3701]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Fink, R. and R. Hinden, &ldquo;6bone (IPv6 Testing Address Allocation) Phaseout,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> 
    most transit ISPs have begun filtering attempted use of such prefixes.
    
</p>
<p> 
    Southampton does participate in global and organization scope IPv6
    multicast networks.   Multicast address allocations are not discussed
    here as they are not in scope for the document.   We note that IPv6
    has advantages for multicast group address allocation.  In IPv4 a 
    site needs to use techniques like GLOP to pick a globally unique
    multicast group to use.   This is problematic if the site does not use
    BGP and have an ASN.   In IPv6 unicast-prefix-based IPv6 multicast
    addresses  empower a site to pick a globally
    unique group address based on its unicast own site or link prefix.
    Embedded RP is also in use, is seen as a potential advantage for IPv6
    and multicast, and has been tested successfully across providers between 
    sites (including paths to/from the US and UK).

<a name="rfc.section.5.1.2"></a><h3>5.1.2.&nbsp;
Forming an address (subnet) allocation plan</h3>

<p>
    The campus has a /16 prefix for
    IPv4 use; in principle 256 subnets of 256 addresses.  In reality the
    subnetting is muddier, because of concerns of IPv4 address conservation;
    subnets are sized to the hosts within them, e.g. a /26 IPv4 prefix is
    used if a subnet has 35 hosts in it.  While this is efficient, it
    increases management burden when physical deployments change, and
    IPv4 subnets require resizing (up or down), even with DHCP in use.
    
</p>
<p>
    The /48 IPv6 prefix is considerably larger than the IPv4 allocation
    already in place at the site.   It is loosely equivalent to a 'Class A'
    IPv4 prefix in that it has 2^16 (over 65,000) subnets, but has an
    effectively unlimited subnet address size (2^64) compared to 256 in
    the IPv4 equivalent.   The increased subnet size means that /64 IPv6
    prefixes can be used on all subnets, without any requirement to 
    resize them at a later date.  The increased subnet volume allows 
    subnets to be allocated more generously to schools and departments in
    the campus.   While address conservation is still important, it is
    no longer an impediment on network management.  Rather, address (subnet)
    allocation is more about embracing the available address space and
    planning for future expansion.
    
</p>
<p>
    In a dual-stack network, we chose to deploy our IP subnets congruently
    for IPv4 and IPv6.  This is because the systems are still in the same 
    administrative domains and the same geography.   We do not expect to
    have IPv6-only subnets in production use for a while yet, outside 
    our test beds and our early Mobile IPv6 trials.   With congruent 
    addressing, our firewall policies are also aligned for IPv4 and IPv6
    traffic at our site border.
    
</p>
<p>
    The subnet allocation plan required a division of the address space
    per school or department.   Here a /56 was allocated to the school
    level of the university; there are around 30 schools currently.
    A /56 of IPv6 address space equates to 256 /64 size subnet allocations.
    Further /56 allocations were made for central IT infrastructure, for
    the network infrastructure and the server side systems.

<a name="rfc.section.5.1.3"></a><h3>5.1.3.&nbsp;
Other considerations</h3>

<p>
    The network uses a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) topology for some level
    of protection of 'public' systems.   Again, this topology is congruent
    with the IPv4 network.
    
</p>
<p>
    There are no specific transition methods deployed internally to the
    campus; everything is using the conventional dual-stack approach.
    There is no use of ISATAP <a class='info' href='#RFC4214'>[RFC4214]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Templin, F., Gleeson, T., Talwar, M., and D. Thaler, &ldquo;Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP),&rdquo; October&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> for example.   
    
</p>
<p>
    For the Mobile IPv6 early trails, we have allocated one prefix for 
    Home Agent (HA) use. We have not yet considered in detail 
    how Mobile IPv6 usage
    may grow, and whether more or even every subnet will require HA
    support.
    
</p>
<p>
    The university operates a tunnel broker <a class='info' href='#RFC3053'>[RFC3053]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Durand, A., Fasano, P., Guardini, I., and D. Lento, &ldquo;IPv6 Tunnel Broker,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>

Node configuration considerations</h3>

<p>
    We currently use stateless autoconfiguration on most subnets for
    IPv6 hosts.   There is no DHCPv6 service deployed yet, beyond tests
    of early code releases.   We plan to deploy DHCPv6 for address
    assignment when robust client and server code is available (at the
    time of writing the potential for this looks good, e.g. via the ISC
    implementation).
    We also are seeking a common integrated DHCP/DNS
    management platform, even if the servers themselves are not co-located,
    including integrated DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 server configuration, as 
    discussed in <a class='info' href='#RFC4477'>[RFC4477]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Chown, T., Venaas, S., and C. Strauf, &ldquo;Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP): IPv4 and IPv6 Dual-Stack Issues,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>.
    Currently we add client statelessly autoconfigured 
    addresses to the DNS manually, though dynamic DNS is an option.   
    Our administrators would prefer the
    use of DHCP because they believe it gives them more management control.
    
</p>
<p>
    Regarding the implications of the larger IPv6 subnet address space on
    scanning attacks <a class='info' href='#reference1'>[reference1]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Chown, T., &ldquo;IPv6 Implications for TCP/UDP Port Scanning (draft-ietf-v6ops-scanning-implications-00.txt),&rdquo; June&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>, we note that all our hosts
    are dual-stack, and thus are potentially exposed over both protocols
    anyway.  We publish all addresses in DNS, and do not operate a two faced
    DNS.  
    
</p>
<p>
    We have internal usage of RFC3041 privacy addresses 
    <a class='info' href='#RFC3041'>[RFC3041]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Narten, T. and R. Draves, &ldquo;Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> currently (certain platforms currently
    ship with it on by default), but
    may wish to administratively disable this (perhaps via DHCP) to ease
    management complexity.   However,  we
    need to determine the feasibility of this on all systems, e.g. for
    guests on wireless LAN or other user-maintained systems.   Network 
    management and monitoring should be 
    simpler without RFC3041 in operation, in terms of identifying which 
    physical hosts are using which addresses.   We note that RFC3041 is only an
    issue for outbound connections, and that there is potential to assign
    privacy addresses via DHCPv6.
    
</p>
<p>
    We manually configure server addresses to avoid address changes on 
    a change of network adaptor.   With IPv6 you can choose to pick ::53
    for a DNS server, or can pick 'random' addresses for obfuscation, 
    though that's not an issue for publicly advertised addresses (dns, mx, 
    web, etc).

Investigation of objective Requirements for an IPv6

<p>The first step of the IPv6 addressing plan design for a Service

      business requirements that have to be satisfied by the services supported 
      by this addressing schema.
      
</p>
<p>According to the different technical constraints and business models 
      as well as the different weights of these requirements (from the point 
      of view of the corresponding Service Provider) it is very likely that 
      different addressing schemas will be developed and deployed by different 
      ISPs.  Nevertheless the addressing schema of sub-section 5.2.2 is one 
      possible example.

Requirements for an IPv6 addressing schema from the LIR perspective of the Service Provider</h3>

<p>In their role as LIR the Service Providers have to care about the policy 
      constraints of the RIRs and the standards of the IETF regarding IPv6 
      addressing. In this context, the following basic requirements and recommendations 
      have to be taken into account and should be satisfied by the IPv6 address 
      allocation plan of a Service Provider:
      
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>As recommended in RFC 3177 [7] and in several RIR policies "Common" customers sites 
      (normally private customers) should receive a /48 prefix from the aggregate of the Service 
      Provider. (Note: The addressing plan must be flexible enough and take into account the 
      possible change of the minimum allocation size for end users currently under definition 
      by the RIRs.)
      
</li>
<li>"Big customers" (like big enterprises, governmental agencies etc.) may receive 
      shorter prefixes according to their needs when this need could be documented and 
      justified to the RIR.
      
</li>
<li>The IPv6 address allocation schema has to be able to meet the HD-ratio of 0.94 as it 
      is defined for IPv6. This requirement corresponds to the demand for an efficient usage 
      of the IPv6 address aggregate by the Service Provider. (Note: A HD-ratio of 0.94 means 
      an effective usage of about 31% of a /20 of the Service Provider on the basis of /48 
      assignments.)
      
</li>
<li>All assignments to customers have to be documented and stored into a database that 
      can also be queried by the RIR.
      
</li>
<li>The LIR has to make available means for supporting the reverse DNS mapping of 
      the customer prefixes.
      
</li>

IPv6 addressing schema requirements from the ISP perspective of the Service Provider</h3>

<p>From ISP perspective the following basic requirements could be identified:
      
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The IPv6 address allocation schema must be able to realize a
      maximal aggregation of all IPv6 address delegations to customers
      into the address aggregate of the Service Provider.  Only this 
      provider aggregate will be routed and injected into the global
      routing table (DFZ).  This strong aggregation keeps the routing
      tables of the DFZ small and eases filtering and access control
      very much.
      
</li>
<li>The IPv6 addressing schema of the SP should contain maximal flexibility since the 
      infrastructure of the SP will change over the time with new customers, transport 
      technologies and business cases. The requirement of maximal flexibility is 
      contrary to the requirements of strong IPv6 address aggregation and efficient 
      address usage, but at this point each SP has to decide which of these requirements 
      to prioritize.
      
</li>
<li>Keeping the multilevel network hierarchy of an ISP in mind, due to addressing 
      efficiency reasons not all hierarchy levels can and should be mapped into the 
      IPv6 addressing schema of an ISP. Sometimes it is much better to implement "flat" 
      addressing for the ISP network than to loose big chunks of the IPv6 address 
      aggregate in addressing each level of network hierarchy. Besides that a decoupling 
      of provider network addressing and customer addressing is recommended. 
      (Note: A strong aggregation e.g. on POP, aggregation router or LER
      level limits the numbers of customer routes that are visible within
      the ISP network but brings also down the efficiency of the IPv6
      addressing schema. That's why each ISP has to decide how many
      internal aggregation levels he wants to deploy.)

IPv6 addressing schema requirements from the Network Access provider perspective of the Service Provider</h3>

<p>As already done for the LIR and the ISP roles of the SP it is also 
      necessary to identify requirements that come from its Network Access 
      Provider role. Some of the basic requirements are:
      
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The IPv6 addressing schema of the SP must be flexible enough to
      adapt changes that are injected from the customer side.  This
      covers changes to addressing architecture or routing topology 
      that are triggered from for instance the raising needs of the 
      customers regarding IPv6 addresses as well as changes that come from
      topological modifications (e.g. when the customer moves from one 
      point of network attachment (POP) to another).
      
</li>
<li>For each IPv6 address assignment to customers a "buffer zone" must be reserved 
      that allows the customer to grow in its addressing range without renumbering or 
      assignment of additional prefixes.
      
</li>
<li>The IPv6 addressing schema of the SP must deal with multiple-attachments of a 
      single customer to the SP network infrastructure (i.e. multi-homed network 
      access with the same SP).
      
</li>
</ul>
<p><p>These few requirements are only part of all the requirements a Service 
      Provider has to investigate and keep in mind during the definition phase 
      of its addressing architecture.  Each SP will most likely add more constraints 
      to this list.

A few thumb rules for designing an IPv6 ISP addressing architecture</h3>

<p>As outcome of the above investigation of requirements regarding an ISP 
      IPv6 addressing plane the following design "thumb rules" should be derived:
      
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>No "One size fits all"
        Each ISP must develop its own IPv6 address allocation schema depending
        on its concrete business needs. It is not practicable to design one
        addressing plan that fits all ISPs (Small / big, Routed / MPLS-based,
        access / transit, LIR / No-LIR, ...).
        
</li>
<li>The levels of IPv6 address aggregation within the ISP addressing
        schema should strongly correspond to the implemented network structure
        and their number should be minimized because of efficiency reasons.
        It is assumed that the SPs own infrastructure will be addressed in a
        fairly flat way whereas the part of the customer addressing architecture 
        should contain several levels of aggregation.
        
</li>
<li>Keep the number of IPv6 customer routes inside your network as small
        as necessary. A totally flat customer IPv6 addressing architecture without any 
        intermediate aggregation level will lead to lots of customer routes 
        inside the SP network. A fair trade-off between address aggregation 
        levels (and hence the size of the internal routing table of the SP)
        and address conservation of the addressing architecture has to be found.
        
</li>
<li>The ISP IPv6 addressing schema should provide maximal flexibility.
        This has to be realized for supporting different sizes of customer IPv6
        address aggregates ("big" customers vs. "small" customers) as well as 
        to allow future growing rates (e.g. of customer aggregates) and 
        possible topological or infrastructural changes.
        
</li>
<li>A limited number of aggregation levels and sizes of customer aggregates
        will ease the management of the  addressing schema. This has to be 
        weighed against the previous "thumb rule" - flexibility.
        
</li>
</ul><p>

Exemplary IPv6 address allocation plan for a Service Provider</h3>

<p>In this example, the Service Provider is assumed to operate an MPLS based 
   backbone and implements 6PE to provide IPv6 backbone transport between the different 
   locations (POPs) of a fully dual-stacked network access and aggregation area.
   
</p>
<p>Besides that it is assumed that the Service Provider:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>has received a /20 from its RIR
</li>
<li>operates its own LIR
</li>
<li>has to address its own IPv6 infrastructure
</li>
<li>delegates prefixes from this aggregate to its customers
</li>
</ul>
<p>This addressing schema should illustrate how the /20 IPv6 prefix of the SP 
   can be used to address the SP-own infrastructure and to delegate IPv6 prefixes 
   to its customers following the above mentioned requirements and thumb rules as 
   far as possible.
   
</p>
<p>The below figure summarizes the device types in an SP network and the typical 
   network design.  The network hierarchy of the SP has to be taken into account for 
   the design of an IPv6 addressing schema and defines its basic shape and the levels 
   of aggregation.

<p>Basic design decisions for the exemplary Service Provider IPv6 address 
      plan regarding customer prefixes take into consideration:
      
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The prefixes assigned to all customers behind the same LER (e.g. LER or 
      LER-BB) are aggregated under one prefix. This ensures that the number of 
      labels that have to be used for 6PE is limited and hence provides a strong MPLS 
      label conservation.
      
</li>
<li>The /20 prefix of the SP is separated into 3 different pools that are 
      used to allocate IPv6 prefixes to the customers of the SP:
      
</li>
<ul class="text">
<li>A pool (e.g. /24) for satisfying the addressing needs of real "big" 
       customers (as defined in 5.2.2.1 sub-section A.) that need IPv6 prefixes 
       larger than /48 (e.g. /32). These customers are assumed to be connected to 
       several POPs of the access network, so that this customer prefix will be 
       visible in each of these POPs.
       
</li>
<li>A pool (e.g. /24) for the LERs with direct customer connections (e.g. 
       dedicated line access) and without an additional aggregation area between 
       the customer and the LER. (These LERs are mostly connected to a limited 
       number of customers because of the limited number of interfaces/ports.)
       
</li>
<li>A larger pool (e.g. 14*/24) for LERs (e.g. LER-BB) that serve a high 
       number of customers that are normally connected via some kind of aggregation 
       network (e.g. DSL customers behind a BB-RAR or Dial-In customers behind a RAR).
       
</li>
<li>The IPv6 address delegation within each Pool (end customer delegation

'Big' customers</h3>

<p>SP&rsquo;s "big" customers receive their prefix from the /24 IPv6 address 
      aggregate that has been reserved for their "big" customers. A customer 
      is considered as "big" customer if it has a very complex network infrastructure 
      and/or huge IPv6 address needs (e.g. because of very large customer numbers) and/or 
      several uplinks to different POPs of the SP network.
      
</p>
<p>The assigned IPv6 address prefixes can have a prefix length in the range 
      32-48 and for each assignment a 300% future growing zone is marked as "reserved" 
      for this customer. This means that for instance with a delegation of a /34 to 
      a customer the /32 that contains this /34 is reserved for the customer for future usage.
      
</p>
<p>The prefixes for the "big" customers can be chosen from the corresponding 
      "big customer" pool by either using an equidistant algorithm or using mechanisms 
      similar to the Sparse Allocation Algorithm (SAA) <a class='info' href='#reference2'>[reference2]<span> (</span><span class='info'>APNIC, ARIN, RIPE NCC, &ldquo;IPv6 Address Allocation and Assignment Policy (www.ripe.net/ripe/docs/ipv6policy.html),&rdquo; January&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>.

<a name="rfc.section.5.2.2.1.2"></a><h3>5.2.2.1.2.&nbsp;
'Common' customers</h3>

<p>All customers that are not "big" customers are considered 
      as "common" customers.  They represent the majority of customers 
      hence they receive a /48 out of the IPv6 customer address pool of 
      the LER where they are directly connected or aggregated.
      
</p>
<p>Again a 300% future growing IPv6 address range is reserved for 
      each customer, so that a "common" customer receives a /48 allocation 
      but has a /46 reserved.
      
</p>
<p>In the network access scenarios where the customer is directly 
      connected to the LER the customer prefix is directly taken out of the 
      customer IPv6 address aggregate (e.g. /38) of the corresponding LER. 
      
</p>
<p>In all other cases (e.g. the customer is attached to a RAR that 
      is themselves aggregated to an AG or to a LER) at least 2 different 
      approaches are possible.
      
</p>
<p>1)  Mapping of Aggregation Network Hierarchy into Customer IPv6 
      Addressing Schema. The aggregation network hierarchy could be mapped 
      into the design of the customer prefix pools of each network level 
      in order to achieve a maximal aggregation at the LER level as well as 
      at the intermediate levels.  (Example: Customer - /48, RAR - /38, AG - /32, 
      LER-BB - /30).  At each network level an adequate growing zone should be 
      reserved.  (Note: This approach requires of course some "fine tuning" of 
      the addressing schema based on a very good knowledge of the Service 
      Provider network topology including actual growing ranges and rates.)
      
</p>
<p>When the IPv6 customer address pool of a LER (or another device of the 
      aggregation network - AG or RAR) is exhausted, the related LER (or AG or 
      RAR) prefix is shortened by 1 or 2 bits (e.g. from /38 to /37 or /36) so 
      that the originally reserved growing zone can be used for further IPv6 
      address allocations to customers.  In the case where the growing zone is 
      exhausted as well a new prefix range from the corresponding pool of the 
      next higher hierarchy level can be requested.
      
</p>
<p>2)  "Flat" Customer IPv6 Addressing Schema.  The other option is to 
      allocate all the customer prefixes directly out of the customer IPv6 
      address pool of the LER where the customers are attached and aggregated 
      and ignore the intermediate aggregation network infrastructure.  This 
      approach leads of course to a higher amount of customer routes at LER 
      and aggregation network level but takes a great amount of complexity 
      out of the addressing schema. Nevertheless the aggregation of the 
      customer prefixes to one prefix at LER level is realized as required above. 
      
</p>
<p>If the actual observed growing rates show that the reserved growing 
      zones are not needed than these growing areas can be freed and used for 
      assignments for prefix pools to other devices at the same level of the 
      network hierarchy.

Defining an IPv6 address allocation plan for the Service Provider Network Infrastructure</h3>

<p>For the IPv6 addressing of SPs own network infrastructure a /32 (or /40) 
    from the "big" customers address pool can be chosen.
    
</p>
<p>This SP infrastructure prefix is used to code the network infrastructure 
    of the SP by assigning a /48 to every POP/location and using for instance a /56 
    for coding the corresponding router within this POP.  Each SP internal link 
    behind a router interface could be coded using a /64 prefix. (Note: While it 
    is suggested to chose a /48 for addressing the POP/location of the SP network 
    it is left to each SP to decide what prefix length to assign to the routers 
    and links within this POP.)
    
</p>
<p>The IIDs of the router interfaces may be generated by using EUI-64 or 
    through plain manual configuration e.g. for coding additional network or 
    operational information into the IID.
    
</p>
<p>It is assumed that a 300% growing zones for each level of network hierarchy 
    and additional prefixes may be assigned to POPs and/or routers if needed.
    
</p>
<p>Loopback interfaces of routers may be chosen from the first /64 of the /56 
    router prefix (in the example above).
    
</p>
<p>(Note: The /32 prefix that has been chosen for addressing SPs own IPv6 
    network infrastructure gives enough place to code additional functionalities 
    like security levels or private and test infrastructure although such 
    approaches haven't been considered in more detail for the above described 
    SP until now.)
    
</p>
<p>Point-to-point links to customers (e.g. PPP links, dedicated line etc.) may 
    be addressed using /126 prefixes out of the first /64 of the access routers 
    that could be reserved for this reason.

<p>From the actual view point of SP there is no compelling reason why ULAs

</p>
<p>ULAs could be used inside the SP network in order to have an additional 
     "site-local scoped" IPv6 address for SPs own infrastructure for instance for 
     network management reasons and maybe also in order to have an addressing schema 
     that couldn't be reached from outside the SP network.
     
</p>
<p>In the case when ULAs are used it is possible to map the proposed internal 
     IPv6 addressing of SPs own network infrastructure as described in 5.2.2.2 above 
     directly to the ULA addressing schema by substituting the /48 POP prefix with a 
     /48 ULA site prefix.

POP Multi-homing or Change of POP</h3>

<p>POP (or better LER) Multi-homing of customers with the same SP can be realized 
    within the proposed IPv6 addressing schema of the SP by assigning multiple LER-dependent 
    prefixes to this customer (i.e. considering each customer location as a single-standing 
    customer) or by choosing a customer prefix out of the pool of "big" customers. The second 
    solution has the disadvantage that in every LER where the customer is attached this 
    prefix will appear inside the IGP routing table requiring an explicit MPLS label.
    
</p>
<p>An equal effect happens when a customer changes its point of attachment to another 
    POP/LER since in this case the customer prefix could not be aggregated into the LER 
    prefix and needs to be advertised more specific in the IGP.
    
</p>
<p>(Note: The described negative POP/LER Multi-homing effects to the addressing 
    architecture in the SP access network are not tackled by implementing the Shim6 Site 
    Multi-homing approach since this approach targets only on a mechanism for dealing 
    with multiple prefixes in end systems &mdash; the SP will nevertheless have unaggregated 
    customer prefixes in its internal routing tables.)

Extensions needed for the later IPv6 migration phases</h3>

<p>The proposed IPv6 addressing schema for a SP needs some slight enhancements / 
    modifications for the later phases of IPv6 integration, for instance in the case 
    when the whole MPLS backbone infrastructure (LDP, IGP etc.) is realized over 
    IPv6 transport an addressing of the LSRs is needed. Other changes may be necessary 
    as well but should not be explained at this point.
