        1. Introduction

   The goal of all-optical meshed networks consists in the transport of
   optical circuit connections, with limited usage of Optical-
   Electrical-Optical conversion through photonic nodes. The gain
   brought by the use of fewer regenerators is balanced by the
   constraint of maintaining the optical signal continuity between the
   source and the destination nodes. In GMPLS controlled networks, the
   induced signal continuity brings the technological challenge of
   wavelength assignment using control plane protocols, which is
   discussed in [WSON-Frame].

Internet-Draft    OSPF Extensions for O-E-O in WSON       October 2010


   The drawback of wavelength assignment computation in a single entity
   is the need to gather and convey all relevant and up-to-date
   information to this single entity. Whether the computing entity takes
   the form of a PCE or the form of a Constrained-Shortest-Path-First
   (C-SPF) engine in each node of the network, the IGP is supposed to do
   the job of gathering this information.

   This document defines extensions to the OSPF routing protocol based
   on [WSON-Encode] to enhance the Traffic Engineering (TE) properties
   of GMPLS TE which are defined in [RFC3630], [RFC4202], and [RFC4203].
   The enhancements to the Traffic Engineering (TE) properties of GMPLS
   TE links can be announced in OSPF TE LSAs. The TE LSA, which is an
   opaque LSA with area flooding scope [RFC3630], has only one top-level
   Type/Length/Value (TLV) triplet and has one or more nested sub-TLVs
   for extensibility. The top-level TLV can take one of three values (1)
   Router Address [RFC3630], (2) Link [RFC3630], (3) Node Attribute
   [RFC5786]. In this document, we introduce a new top-level TLV
   containing Resource Block Attribute (RBA).

   [WSON-Encode] introduce the concept of RBA to include all information
   that are specific to WSON nodes. This information may introduce some
   additional constrains that needs to be considered to perform a
   correct RWA. This document does not define any additional encoding
   but maps information from [WSON-Info] and [WSON-Encode] on OSPF.

   The detailed encoding of OSPF extensions are not defined in this
   document. [WSON-Encode] provides encoding detail.

        2. Resource Block Attribute

   This draft defines a new top-TLV named "Resource Block Attribute"
   TLV. It carries attributes related to a pool of Optical-Electric-
   Optical regeneration resource, thus allowing route computation to
   take into account available signal regenerators in the network.

   Available OEO resource introduce different kind of constrains. One is
   the signal compatibility as defined in [WSON-Signal]. Another
   constrain comes from WSON node topologies (for technology reasons or
   cost of resources). This draft mainly refers to the latter.

   Multiple O-E-O resources are logically gathered in a pool when they
   share a common transmission media before (and after) entering
   (exiting) the actual switching matrix of the node. A common
   transmission media is characterized by the sharing of at least a
   short section of fiber: hence an amplifier or a wavelength selective
   switch does also correspond to a common transmission media.

Internet-Draft    OSPF Extensions for O-E-O in WSON       October 2010


   When several regenerators' pools are available on a node, several
   "Resource Block Attribute" will be used (one for each pool). As a
   matter of fact, the split into blocks of the O-E-O resources comes
   from the architectural structure of the node. This Node Attribute TLV
   contains two or more sub-TLVs.

   The resource block attributes related to OEO pools in WSON nodes
   include Block ID, lists of available wavelengths on the ingress and
   egress side of the pool, and the features of the resources in the
   block. These pieces of information are described in this document and
   refer to . The Resource Block Attribute would also include some sub-
   TLVs identical to sub-TLVs of the TE-link top-TLV: TE-metric
   [rfc3630], Administrative Group [rfc3630], Link Local/Remote
   Identifiers [rfc4203], Shared-Risk Link Group [rfc4203].

   The following new sub-TLVs are added to the "Resource Block
   Attribute" TLV. Detailed description for newly defined sub-TLVs is
   provided at the end of the section.

    Sub-TLV Type   Length     Name

        TBD        4 Bytes    Block ID

        TBD        variable   Block Shared Access Wavelength
   Availability

        TBD        fixed      Resource Element Information

   In "Resource Block Attribute", the sub-TLV "Block Shared Access
   Wavelength Availability" and "Resource Block Information" are
   mandatory, the other sub-TLV listed above is optional.

   The following sub-TLVs to the "Resource Block Attribute" TLV are
   identical to the ones defined respectively in [RFC3630] and
   [RFC4203], and being defined for the TE-link top-TLV. Detailed
   description for newly defined sub-TLV is provided at the end of the
   section.

    Sub-TLV Type   Length     Name

        TBD        4 Bytes    TE-metric [alike RFC3630]

        TBD        4 Bytes    Administrative Group [alike RFC3630]

        TBD        8 Bytes    Link Local/Remote Identifiers [alike
   RFC4203]

        TBD        variable   Shared Risk Link Group [alike RFC4203]

   In "Resource Block Attribute", the sub-TLV "Link Local/Remote
   Identifiers" is mandatory as it is needed to ensure the consistency
   with the Node Information described in [Gen-OSPF] and [Gen-Encode].
   The other sub-TLVs listed above are optional.

2.1. Pool ID

   This optional sub-TLV can be used to provide an identifier to the
   regenerator pool.

2.2. Block Shared Access Wavelength Availability

   This block includes information from [WSON-Encode] section 4.4 "Block
   Shared Access Wavelength Availability". It is used to describe the
   wavelengths available on the shared fibers (ingress and egress sides)
   of the pool.

   At every RWA process the OEO pool may or may-not be used. The status
   of the wavelength availability will change. The information is fairly
   dynamic.

2.3. Resource Element Information

   This sub-TLV advertises information that describes the features of
   the resource elements inside the resource block itself. The features
   are the accepted bit-rates, modulation format, FEC formats, etc...

   Actually this sub-TLV is replicated in a list of such sub-TLVs in
   order to depict all the resource elements available in the pool. The
   description of the encoding of this sub-TLV is available in [WSON-
   encode] section 5 (Hence needs a slight adaptation of TLV described
   in 5.1: Resource Block Information).

   The features of a given element are fairly static as they refer to
   the characteristics of the device, which mean that the content of a
   given sub-TLV is static. On the other hand, the elements composing
   the list are subject to change, when a device is used, its
   corresponding sub-TLV will disappear from the list.

2.4. Relation with Node

   Accessing resource block is also subject to switching constraints.
   These switching constraints can be both spatial and spectral.

   In order to convey this information, the Connectivity Matrix sub-TLV
   shall depict the ports of the O-E-O pool, and referring their Link
   Local/Remote Identifiers sub-TLV as described in section 2.

   Hence the number of ports described by the connectivity matrix is:

   # Ingress ports (CM): # incoming links (Node) + # O-E-O pools

   # Egress ports (CM): # outgoing links (Node) + # O-E-O pools

  3. Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any further security issues other
   than those discussed in [RFC 3630], [RFC 4203].

  4. IANA Considerations

   [RFC3630] says that the top level Types in a TE LSA and Types for
   sub-TLVs for each top level Types must be assigned by Expert Review,
   and must be registered with IANA.

   IANA is requested to allocate new Types for the sub-TLVs as defined
   in Sections 2, 3, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 as follows:

4.1. Resource Block attributes

   This document introduces the "O-E-O Pool Attribute" top-TLV, value
   TBD with the following sub-TLVs:

         Type    Name

         TBD    Pool ID

         TBD    Block Shared Access Wavelength Availability

         TBD    Resource Element Information

         TBD    TE-metric [alike RFC3630]

         TBD    Administrative Group [alike RFC3630]

         TBD    Link Local/Remote Identifiers [alike RFC4203]

         TBD    Shared Risk Link Group [alike RFC4203]
