                The use case in Edge Datacenter network
                 draft-aoch-nvo3-edge-datacenter-00.txt

Abstract

   This document introduce the Edge Datacentet network, and describe
   some use cases about Edge Datacenter, discuss an important component
   in the Edge Datacenter:Service Gateway and its functions.

   Service Gateway as a flow distribution device in the Edge DC network,
   it needs to not only play a gateway of the edge Datacenter network,
   implementing coordination with existing technology,but also meets
   many new requirements.  For example, acts as a traffic distributor to
   make sure the packets goes into Edge DC or Metro network, SDN
   forwarding, and as a leaf in the leaf-spin architecture.

1.  Introduction

   With the challenge and the chances of the new network SDN/NFV and the
   development of the Datacenter, the provider is facing many changes
   from traditional network, which is representive by traditional CO.
   How to use the resource of the traditinal CO fully and achieve the
   transition to the SDN/NFV is the problem providers and vendors need
   to consider.  CO re-architection is the attractive to more and more
   providers and vendors.  and getting more and more attention.  Using
   lots of CO resource, the providers can re-architected CO to Edge DC,
   which is more adaptive in SDN/NFV.

   In this document, we will present the description of the Edge
   Datacenter and its main component Service gateway.  As a result, some
   requirements are proposed for Edge DC and Service Gateway.

2.  Terminology

   Edge DC: a Datacenter network which is close to user, may by
   recontructureed from CO, and is SDN/NFV

   Servie Gateway: flow distribution device in the Edge Datacenter
   network.

   CO: Center Office.

3.  Edge Datacenter

   There are many communication COs and there are lots of traditional
   dedicated devices in these COs in providers network.  But with the
   evoluation of SDN/NFV, Edge Datacenter is developed based on CO.
   Edge Datacenter basic architecture is showed as Figure 1.  In the
   Edge Datacenter, general server can be used as network element.
   Virtual network elements includes vBNG,vCPE,vOLT,etc.  And the Edge
   Datacenter uses leaf-spin topology.  There are three types in leaf:
   distribution leaf, Server leaf and Board leaf.  Server leaf is
   connecting Server.  Board leaf is the DGW providing DC
   interconnection.  Distribution leaf is the SGW in Figure 1.  As a key
   node in the Edge datacenter, Service Gateway will be elaborated in
   the next clause.

3.1.  Use case of the EDC

   EDC is in the place that is closest to user.  It may not have a large
   scale, but because of its "edge" propoerty, it can meet most access
   requirements from user.These EDC can get realtime data update through
   WAN and core DC.  By the EDC, we can not only avoid to tranmit lots
   of duplicated data, but also let the users get the same service and
   data as same as from core DC, but with better experience.

   In this section, we will list 4 use cases of the EDC to make it
   clear.

3.1.1.  Future video application

   In this use case, all the video traffic are getted from EDC so that
   the users can get better experience when they play games or watch
   video,etc.  EDC has the capability of abstract for elephant
   traffic(IPTV), and support the extremely low latency video
   application.  Figure 2 is the diagram of this case.

3.1.2.  Edge IOT control application

   EDC has its own computational capbility, and getting more and more
   intelligent.  In the case that UAV( UnmannedAerialVehicle ), it needs
   to communicate with the apps in EDC so that the UAV can be remote
   controlled.  Similar with other IOT control scenarios.  Figure 3 is
   the diagram of this case.

3.1.3.  Home Hybird Cloud

   In this case, EDC is an extension of Home Gateway.  Some expanded
   computation or expanded store are extended into EDC instead of on
   HGW.  Even some APPs can also extened into EDC.  Users can get more
   applications, such as OTT white box, remote download, and remote
   desktop, etc.  Figure 4 is the diagram of this case.

3.1.4.  Light weight lease line based on application

   In this use case, EDC is a control node for user 2/3 layer lease line
   (VxLAN or MPLS).  It can support dynamically setup the tunnel
   according to application identification; support user private IP
   address or address management, etc.  Figure 5 is the diagram of this
   case.

4.  Service Gateway

   From those use case above, we know that Service Gateway as a key node
   in the forwarding plane, is a flow distribution device in Edge DC
   network.  It needs not only to support currently existing protocols,
   but aslo to meet all kinds of new requirements, ie.  SDN forwarding,
   virtualization,SDN control, and spine-leaf network architecture,
   dynamic SFC, etc.  The main purpose of the Service Gateway is to
   improve the forwarding, and converge or distribute traffic according
   to different service.  By the Service Gateway, we can avoid the
   hairpin of the traffic to Metro network, and divide the traffic into
   north-south traffic and south-east traffic clearly.

4.1.  Functions

4.1.1.  PPPoE proxy

   To terminate PPPoE tunnel.

4.1.2.  VxLAN encapsulation

   Encapsulate the packets into Edge DC with VxLAN as VTEP.  Provide
   VxLAN mapping, forwarding, and interconnection with VLAN as a
   gateway.

4.1.3.  C/S VLAN forwarding

   Support QinQ VLAN forwarding, so that be compatible to traditional
   network, and reduce the capacity of FDB.

4.1.4.  Distribution

   Achieve traffic distribution according to service VLAN.  The
   forwarding table on the SGW can be configurated by the SDN controller
   with NATCONF or OFPCONFIG protocol.

   Can implement linea forwarding based any field in IP header.

5.  Conclusion

   CO being re-architected as Edge DC is a very important step for
   provider's evolving to SDN/NFV.

6.  Security Considerations

   Service Gateway must have the capability of checking the validation
   of user's address.

7.  IANA Considerations
