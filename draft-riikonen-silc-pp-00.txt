1. Introduction

   This document describes a Packet Protocol used in the Secure Internet
   Live Conferencing (SILC) protocol specified in the Secure Internet Live
   Conferencing, Protocol Specification Internet Draft [SILC1].  This
   protocol describes the packet types and packet payloads which defines
   the contents of the packets.  The protocol provides secure binary packet
   protocol that assures that the contents of the packets are secured and
   authenticated.

   The basis of SILC protocol relies in the SILC packets and it is with
   out a doubt the most important part of the protocol.  It is also probably
   the most complicated part of the protocol.  Packets are used all the
   time in the SILC network to send messages, commands and other information.
   All packets in SILC network are always encrypted and their integrity
   is assured by computed MACs.  The protocol defines several packet types
   and packet payloads.  Each packet type usually has a specific packet
   payload that actually defines the contents of the packet.  Each packet
   also includes a default SILC Packet Header that provides sufficient
   information about the origin of the packet and destination of the
   packet.

2 SILC Packet Protocol

2.1 SILC Packet

   SILC packets deliver messages from sender to receiver securely by
   encrypting important fields of the packet.  The packet consists of
   default SILC Packet Header, Padding, Packet Payload data, and, packet
   MAC.

   The following diagram illustrates typical SILC packet.


      - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
     |   n bytes   | 1 - n bytes |      n bytes       |  n bytes
     | SILC Header |   Padding   |    Data Payload    |    MAC
      - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

                      Figure 1:  Typical SILC Packet


   SILC Header is always the first part of the packet and its purpose
   is to provide information about the packet.  It provides for example
   the packet type, origin of the packet and the destination of the packet.
   The header is variable in length and first two (2) bytes of the
   header (thus first two bytes of the packet) are not encrypted.  The
   first two (2) bytes are the length of the packet which is not encrypted.
   See following section for description of SILC Packet header.  Packets
   without SILC header or with malformed SILC header must be dropped.

   Padding follows the packet header.  The purpose of the padding is to
   make the packet multiple by eight (8) or by the block size of the
   cipher used in the encryption, which ever is larger.  The maximum
   length of padding is currently 16 bytes.  The padding is always
   encrypted.

   Data payload area follows padding and it is the actual data of the
   packet.  The packet data is the packet payloads defined in this
   protocol.  The data payload area is always encrypted.

   The last part of SILC packet is the packet MAC that assures the
   integrity of the packet.  The MAC is always computed from the packet
   before the encryption is applied to the packet.  If compression is used
   in the packet the MAC is computed after the compression has been
   applied.  The compression, on the other hand, is always applied before
   encryption.

   All fields in all packet payloads are always in MSB (most significant
   byte first) order.

2.2 SILC Packet Header

   The default SILC packet header is applied to all SILC packets and it is
   variable in length.  The purpose of SILC Packet header is to provide
   detailed information about the packet.  The receiver of the packet uses
   the packet header to parse the packet and gain other relevant parameters
   of the packet.

   Following diagram represents the default SILC header format.
   (*) indicates that this field is never encrypted.  Other fields are
   always encrypted.

      o Payload Length (2 bytes) - Is the length of the packet
        not including the padding of the packet.  This field must
        not be encrypted but must always be authenticated.

      o Flags (1 byte) - Indicates flags to be used in packet
        processing.  Several flags may be set by ORing the flags
        together.

        Following flags are reserved for this field:






Riikonen                                                        [Page 5]

Internet Draft                                              28 June 2000


           No flags                  0x00

             In this case the field is ignored.


           Private Message Key       0x01

             Indicates that the packet must include private
             message that is encrypted using private key set by
             client.  Servers does not know anything about this
             key and this causes that the private message is
             not handled by the server at all, it is just
             passed along.  See section 2.5.3 Private Message
             Encryption And Decryption for more information.


           Broadcast                 0x02

             Marks the packet to be broadcasted.  Client cannot
             send broadcast packet and normal server cannot send
             broadcast packet.  Only router server may send broadcast
             packet.  The router receiving of packet with this flag
             set must send (broadcast) the packet to its primary
             route.  If router has several router connections the
             packet may be sent only to the primary route.  See
             section 2.11 Packet Broadcasting for description of
             packet broadcasting.


           Tunneled                  0x04

             Marks that the packet is tunneled.  Tunneling means
             that extra SILC Packet Header has been applied to the
             original packet.  The outer header has this flag
             set.  See section 2.13 Packet Tunneling for more
             information.



   o Packet Type (1 byte) - Is the type of the packet. Receiver
     uses this field to parse the packet.  See section 2.3
     SILC Packets for list of defined packet types.

   o Source ID Length (2 bytes) - Indicates the length of the
     Source ID field in the header, not including this or any
     other fields.

Internet Draft                                              28 June 2000


   o Destination ID Length (2 bytes) - Indicates the length of the
     Destination ID field in the header, not including this or
     any other fields.

   o Src ID Type (1 byte) - Indicates the type of ID in the
     Source ID field.  See section 2.4 SILC ID Types for
     defined ID types.

   o Source ID (variable length) - The actual source ID that
     indicates who is the original sender of the packet.

   o Dst ID Type (1 byte) - Indicates the type of ID in the
     Destination ID field.  See section 2.4 SILC ID Types for
     defined ID types.

   o Destination ID (variable length) - The actual source ID that
     indicates who is the end receiver of the packet.


2.3 SILC Packet Types

   SILC packet types defines the contents of the packet and it is used by
   the receiver to parse the packet.  The packet type is 8 bits, as a one
   byte, in length.  The range for the packet types are from 0 - 255,
   where 0 is never sent and 255 is currently reserved for future
   extensions and must not be defined to any other purpose.  Every SILC
   specification compliant implementation should support all of these packet
   types.

   The below list of the SILC Packet types includes reference to the packet
   payload as well.  Packet payloads are the actual packet, that is, the data
   that the packet consists of.  Each packet type defines packet payload
   which usually may only be sent with the specific packet type.

   Most of the packets are packets that must be destined directly to entity
   that is connected to the sender.  It is not allowed, for example, for
   router to send disconnect packet to client that is not directly connected
   to the router.  However, there are some special packet types that may
   be destined to some entity that the sender has not direct connection
   with.  These packets are for example private message packets, channel
   message packets, command packets and some other packets that may be
   broadcasted in the SILC network.  If the packet is allowed to be sent to
   indirectly connected entity it is mentioned separately in the packet
   description (unless it is obvious as in private and channel message
   packets).  Other packets must not be sent or accepted, if sent, to
   indirectly connected entities.

   List of SILC Packet types are defined as follows.

      0    SILC_PACKET_NONE

           This type is reserved and it is never sent.


      1    SILC_PACKET_DISCONNECT

           This packet is sent to disconnect the remote end.  Reason of
           the disconnection is sent inside the packet payload.  Client
           usually does not send this packet.

           Payload of the packet:  See section 2.3.2 Disconnect Payload


      2    SILC_PACKET_SUCCESS

           This packet is sent upon successful execution of some protocol.
           The status of the success is sent in the packet.

           Payload of the packet:  See section 2.3.3 Success Payload


      3    SILC_PACKET_FAILURE

           This packet is sent upon failure of some protocol.  The status
           of the failure is sent in the packet.

           Payload of the packet:  See section 2.3.4 Failure Payload


      4    SILC_PACKET_REJECT

           This packet may be sent upon rejection of some protocol.
           The status of the rejection is sent in the packet.

           Payload of the packet:  See section 2.3.5 Reject Payload


      5    SILC_PACKET_NOTIFY

           This packet is used to send notify message, usually from
           server to client, although it may be sent from server to another
           server as well.  Client never sends this packet.  Server may
           send this packet to channel as well when the packet is
           distributed to all clients on the channel.  Receiver of this
           packet may ignore the packet if it chooses so.  However, it
           should not be ignored.

           Payload of the packet:  See section 2.3.6 Notify Payload.


      6    SILC_PACKET_ERROR

           This packet is sent when an error occurs.  Server may
           send this packet.  Client never sends this packet.  The
           client may entirely ignore the packet, however, server is
           most likely to take action anyway.

           Payload of the packet:  See section 2.3.7 Error Payload.


      7    SILC_PACKET_CHANNEL_MESSAGE

           This packet is used to send messages to channels.  The packet
           includes Channel ID of the channel and the actual message to
           the channel.  Messages sent to the channel are always protected
           by channel specific keys.  Channel Keys are distributed by
           SILC_PACKET_CHANNEL_KEY packet.

           When client sends this packet the destination ID in the SILC
           header must be the Channel ID of the channel the message is
           destined to.  If server sends this packet to a client the
           destination ID in the SILC header must be the Client ID of
           the client receiving the packet.

           If server sends this packet to router or if router sends this
           packet to server or another router the destination ID in the
           SILC header must be the Channel ID of the channel.  Server
           (including router) distributes this packet only to its local
           clients who are joined to the channel.  Servers and routers
           also determines who are on the channel and when this packet
           needs to be sent, as described in section Client To Client
           in [SILC1].

           Payload of the packet:  See section 2.3.8 Channel Message
                                   Payload


      8    SILC_PACKET_CHANNEL_KEY

           This packet is used to distribute new key for particular
           channel.  Each channel has their own independent keys that
           is used to protect the traffic on the channel.  Only server
           may send this packet.  This packet may be sent to entity
           that is indirectly connected to the sender.

           Payload of the packet:  See section 2.3.9 Channel Key Payload


      9    SILC_PACKET_PRIVATE_MESSAGE

           This packet is used to send private messages from client
           to another client.  By default, private messages are protected
           by session keys established by normal key exchange protocol.
           However, it is possible to use specific key to protect private
           messages.  SILC_PACKET_PRIVATE_MESSAGE_KEY packet is used to
           agree the key with the remote client.  Pre-shared key may be
           used as well if both of the client knows it, however, it needs
           to be agreed outside SILC.  See more of this in [SILC1].

           Payload of the packet:  See section 2.3.10 Private Message
                                   Payload


      10   SILC_PACKET_PRIVATE_MESSAGE_KEY

           This packet is used to agree about a key to be used to protect
           the private messages between two clients.  If this is not sent
           the normal session key is used to protect the private messages
           inside SILC network.  Agreeing to use specific key to protect
           private messages adds security, as no server between the two
           clients will be able to decrypt the private message.  However,
           servers inside SILC network are considered to be trusted, thus
           using normal session key to protect private messages does not
           degree security.  Whether to agree to use specific keys by
           default or to use normal session keys by default, is
           implementation specific issue.  See more of this in [SILC1].

           Payload of the packet:  See section 2.3.11 Private Message

           Server may send this packet to other servers as well.  All
           commands are listed in their own section SILC Command Types
           in [SILC1].  The contents of this packet is command specific.
           This packet may be sent to entity that is indirectly connected
           to the sender.

          is not sent.


2.3.1 SILC Packet Payloads

   All payloads resides in the main data area of the SILC packet.  However
   all payloads must be at the start of the data area after the default
   SILC packet header and padding.  All fields in the packet payload are
   always encrypted, as, they reside in the data area of the packet which
   is always encrypted.

   Payloads described in this section are common payloads that must be
   accepted anytime during SILC session.  Most of the payloads may only
   be sent with specific packet type which is defined in the description
   of the payload.

   There are a lot of other payloads in the SILC as well.  However, they
   are not common in the sense that they could be sent at any time.
   These payloads are not described in this section.  These are payloads
   such as SILC Key Exchange payloads and so on.  These are described
   in [SILC1] and [SILC3].


2.3.2 Disconnect Payload

   Disconnect payload is sent upon disconnection.  The payload is simple;
   reason of disconnection is sent to the disconnected party.

   The payload may only be sent with SILC_PACKET_DISCONNECT packet.  It
   must not be sent in any other packet type.  Following diagram represents
   the Disconnect Payload.

2.3.6 Notify Payload

   Notify payload is used to send notify messages.  The payload is usually
   sent from server to client, however, server may send it to another
   server as well.  Client must not send this payload.  The receiver of
   this payload may totally ignore the contents of the payload, however,
   notify message should be noted and possibly logged.

   The payload may only be sent with SILC_PACKET_NOTIFY packet.  It must
   not be sent in any other packet type.  Following diagram represents the
   Notify Payload.

2.3.7 Error Payload

   Error payload is sent upon error.  Error may occur in various
   conditions when server sends this packet.  Client may not send this
   payload but must be able to accept it.  However, client may
   totally ignore the contents of the packet as server is going to
   take action on the error anyway.  However, it is recommended
   that the client takes error packet seriously.

        message.


2.3.8 Channel Message Payload

   Channel messages are the most common messages sent in the SILC.
   Channel Message Payload is used to send message to channels.  These
   messages can only be sent if client has joined to some channel.
   Even though this packet is the most common in SILC it is still
   special packet.  Some special handling on sending and reception
   of channel message is required.

   Padding must be applied into this payload since the payload is
   encrypted separately from other parts of the packet with the
   channel specific key.  Hence the requirement of the padding.
   The padding should be random data.  The packet must be made
   multiple by eight (8) or by the block size of the cipher, which
   ever is larger.

   The SILC header in this packet is encrypted with the session key
   of the next receiver of the packet.  Nothing else is encrypted
   with that key.  Thus, the actual packet and padding to be
   encrypted with the session key is SILC Header plus padding to it
   to make it multiple by eight (8) or multiple by the block size
   of the cipher, which ever is larger.

   Receiver of the the channel message packet is able to determine
   the channel the message is destined to by checking the destination
   ID from the SILC Packet header which tells the destination channel.
   The original sender of the packet is also determined by checking
   the source ID from the header which tells the who client sent
   the message.

   The payload may only be sent with SILC_PACKET_CHANNEL_MESSAGE packet.
   It  must not be sent in any other packet type.  Following diagram
   represents the Channel Message Payload.

   (*) indicates that the field is not encrypted.

        the channel.

      o Padding Length (2 bytes) - Indicates the length of the
        Padding field in the payload, not including any other
        field.

      o Padding (variable length) - The padding that must be
        applied because this payload is encrypted separately from
        other parts of the packet.

      o Initial Vector (variable length) - The initial vector
        that has been used in packet encryption.  It needs to be
        used in the packet decryption as well.  What this field
        includes is implementation issue.  However, it is
        recommended that it would be random data or, perhaps,
        a timestamp.  It is not recommended to use zero (0) as
        initial vector.  This field is not encrypted.  This field
        is not included into the padding calculation.  Length
        of this field equals the cipher's block size.  This field
        is, however, authenticated.


2.3.9 Channel Key Payload

   All traffic in channels are protected by channel specific keys.
   Channel Key Payload is used to distribute channel keys to all
   clients on the particular channel.  Channel keys are sent when
   the channel is created, when new user joins to the channel and
   whenever a user leaves a channel.  Server creates the new
   channel key and distributes it to the clients by encrypting this
   payload with the session key shared between the server and
   the client.  After that, client starts using the key received
   in this payload to protect the traffic on the channel.

   Channel keys are cell specific thus every router in cell have
   to create a channel key and distribute it if any client in the
   cell has joined to a channel.  Channel traffic between cell's
   are not encrypted using channel keys, they are encrypted using
   normal session keys between two routers.  Inside a cell, all
   channel traffic is encrypted with the specified channel key.
   Channel key should expire peridiocally, say, in one hour, in
   which case new channel key is created and distributed.

   The payload may only be sent with SILC_PACKET_CHANNEL_KEY packet.
   It must not be sent in any other packet type.  Following diagram
   represents the Channel Key Payload.

        encryption function.


2.3.10 Private Message Payload

   Private Message Payload is used to send private message between
   two clients (or users for that matter).  The messages are sent only
   to the specified user and no other user inside SILC network is
   able to see the message.  The message is protected by the session
   key established by the SILC Key Exchange Protocol.  However,
   it is also possible to agree to use specific keys to protect
   just the private messages.  See section 2.3.11 Private Message
   Key Payload for detailed description of how to agree to use
   specific key.

   If normal session key is used to protect the message, every
   server between the sender client and the receiving client needs
   to decrypt the packet and always re-encrypt it with the session
   key of the next receiver of the packet.  See section Client
   To Client in [SILC1].

   When specific key is used to protect the message, servers between
   the sender and the receiver needs not to decrypt/re-encrypt the
   packet.  Section 4.8.2 Client To Client in [SILC1] gives example of
   this scheme as well.

   The payload may only be sent with SILC_PACKET_PRIVATE_MESSAGE
   packet.  It must not be sent in any other packet type.  Following
   diagram represents the Private Message Payload.

   two clients.  If this payload is not sent normal session key
   established by the SILC Key Exchange Protocol is used to protect
   the private messages.

   This payload may only be sent by client to another client.  Server
   must not send this payload at any time.  After sending this payload
   the sender of private messages must set the Private Message Key
   flag into SILC Packet Header.

   The payload may only be sent with SILC_PACKET_PRIVATE_MESSAGE_KEY
   packet.  It must not be sent in any other packet type.  Following

      o SILC Command (1 byte) - SILC Command identifier.  This must
        be set to non-zero value.  If zero (0) value is found in this
        field the packet must be discarded.

      o Arguments Num (1 byte) - Indicates the number of arguments
        associated with the command.  If there are no arguments this
        field is set to zero (0).  The arguments must follow the
        command payload.

      o Payload Length (2 bytes) - Length of the entire command
        payload including any command argument payloads associated
        with this payload.

   See [SILC1] for detailed description of different SILC commands,
   their arguments and their reply messages.


2.3.12.1 Command Argument Payload

   Command Argument Payload is used to set arguments for SILC commands.
   Number of arguments associated with a command are indicated by the
   Command Payload in the Arguments Num field.  Command argument
   payloads may only be used with a command payload and they must
   always reside right after the command payload.  Incorrect amount of

      o Argument Num (1 byte) - Indicates the number of this argument.
        For first argument this is set to 1, for second argument this
        is set to 2, and so forth.  If incorrect value is found
        in this field the packet must be discarded.  Value is
        incorrect if it is zero (0) or, for example, a third argument
        does not include value 3.

      o Argument Type (1 byte) - Indicates the type of the argument.
        Every command specify a number for each argument that maybe
        associated with the command.  By using this number the receiver
        of the packet knows what type of argument this is.  The numbers
        are command specific and has been defined in section SILC
        Commands in [SILC1].  This field makes it possible to send
        arguments in free order as this field is used to identify
        the specific type of the argument.

      o Payload Length (2 bytes) - Length of the argument payload data
        area not including the length of any other fields in the
        payload.

      o Argument Data (variable length) - Argument data.


2.3.13 Command Reply Payload

   Command Reply Payload is used to send replies to the commands sent
   by the client.  The Command Reply Payload is identical to the
   Command Payload hence see the upper sections for Command Payload
   and for Command Argument Payload specifications.  Command Reply
   message uses the Command Argument Payload as well.

   SILC commands, their arguments and their reply messages.


2.3.14 Connection Auth Request Payload

   Client may send this payload to server to request the authentication
   method that must be used in authentication protocol.  If client knows
   this information beforehand this payload is not necessary to be sent.
   Server performing authentication with another server may also send
   this payload to request the authentication method.  If the connecting
   server already knows this information this payload is not necessary
   to be sent.

   Server receiving this request must reply with same payload sending
   the mandatory authentication method.  Algorithms that may be required
   to be used by the authentication method are the ones already
   established by the SILC Key Exchange protocol.  See section Key
   Exchange Start Payload in [SILC3] for detailed information.

   The payload may only be sent with SILC_PACKET_CONNECTION_AUTH_REQUEST
   packet.  It must not be sent in any other packet type.  Following
   diagram represents the Connection Auth Request Payload.

           2    Server connection
           3    Router connection

        If any other type is found in this field the packet must be
        discarded and the authentication must be failed.

      o Authentication Method (2 bytes) - Indicates the authentication
        method to be used in the authentication protocol.  Following
        authentication methods are defined:

           1    password    (mandatory)
           2    public key  (mandatory)

        If any other type is found in this field the packet must be
        discarded and the authentication must be failed.  If this
        payload is sent as request to receive the mandatory
        authentication method this field must be set to zero (0),
        indicating that receiver should send the mandatory
        authentication method.  The receiver sending this payload
        to the requesting party, may also set this field to zero (0)
        to indicate that authentication is not required.  In this
        case authentication protocol still must be started but
        server is most likely to respond with SILC_PACKET_SUCCESS
        immediately.


2.3.15 New ID Payload

   New ID Payload is a multipurpose payload.  It is used to send newly
   created ID's from clients and servers.  When client connects to server
   and registers itself to the server by sending SILC_PACKET_NEW_CLIENT
   packet, server replies with this packet by sending the created ID for
   the client.  Server always creates the ID for the client.

   This payload is also used when server tells its router that new client
   has registered to the SILC network.  In this case the server sends
   the Client ID of the client to the router.  Similiary when router
   distributes information to other routers about the client in the SILC
   network this payload is used.

   Also, when server connects to router, router uses this payload to inform
   other routers about new server in the SILC network.  However, every
   server (or router) creates their own ID's thus the ID distributed by
   this payload is not created by the distributor in this case.  Servers
   create their own ID's.  Server registers itself to the network by sending
   SILC_PACKET_NEW_SERVER to the router it connected to.  The case is same
   when router connects to another router.

   Hence, this payload is very important and used every time when some
   new entity is registered to the SILC network.  Client never sends this
   payload.  Both client and server (and router) may receive this payload.

   The payload may only be sent with SILC_PACKET_NEW_ID packet.  It must
   not be sent in any other packet type.  Following diagram represents the
   New ID Payload.

      o ID Length (2 bytes) - Length of the ID Data area not
        including the length of any other fields in the payload.

      o ID Data (variable length) - The actual ID data.



2.3.16 New ID List Payload

   New ID List Payload is used to distribute list of ID's usually from
   server to router but also from router to other routers in the network.
   This payload is used, for example, when server is connected to router
   and the server wants to distribute all of its locally connected clients
   and locally created channels to the router.  It is convenient in this
   case to use this payload instead of sending all the information one
   by one using New ID Payload.

   There is no specific payload for this packet type.  The packet type
   uses same payload as described in previous section.  To form a list
   several payloads is put in the packet each after each.  The payload
   is variable in length but can be calculated by calculating the ID
   Type field, Length field and the ID Data fields together.  This forms
   one New ID Payload in the list.

   The list of payloads may only be sent with SILC_PACKET_NEW_ID_LIST
   packet.  They must not be sent in any other packet type.


2.3.17 New Client Payload

   When client is connected to the server, keys has been exchanged and
   connection has been authenticated client must register itself to the

   server.  Clients first packet after key exchange and authentication
   protocols must be SILC_PACKET_NEW_CLIENT.  This payload tells server all
   the relevant information about the connected user.  Server creates a new
   client ID for the client when received this payload and sends it to the
   client in New ID Payload.

   This payload sends username and real name of the user on the remote host
   which is connected to the SILC server with SILC client.  The server
   creates the client ID according the information sent in this payload.
   The nickname of the user becomes the username sent in this payload.
   However, client should call NICK command after sending this payload to
   set the real nickname of the user which is then used to create new
   client ID.

   The payload may only be sent with SILC_PACKET_NEW_CLIENT packet.  It
   must not be sent in any other packet type.  Following diagram represents
   the New Client Payload.

2.3.18 New Server Payload

   This payload is sent by server when it has completed successfully both
   key exchange and connection authentication protocols.  The server
   uses this payload to register itself to the SILC network.  The
   first packet after these key exchange and authentication protocols
   is SILC_PACKET_NEW_SERVER packet.  The payload includes the Server ID
   of the server that it has created by itself.  It also includes a
   name of the server that is associated to the Server ID.

   The payload may only be sent with SILC_PACKET_NEW_SERVER packet.  It
   must not be sent in any other packet type.  Following diagram represents
   the New Server Payload.

2.3.19 New Channel Payload

   Information about newly created channel is broadcasted to all routers

   in the SILC network by sending this packet payload.  Channels are
   created by router of the cell.  Server never creates channels unless
   it is a standalone server and it does not have router connection,
   in this case server acts as router.  Normal server sends JOIN command
   to the router (after it has received JOIN command from client) which
   then processes the command and creates the channel.  Client never sends
   this packet.

   The payload may only be sent with SILC_PACKET_NEW_CHANNEL packet.
   It must not be sent in any other packet type.  Following diagram
   represents the New Channel Payload.

2.3.20 New Channel User Payload

   When client (user) joins to a channel, server must notify routers
   about the new user on the channel.  Normal server sends this packet
   payload to its router which then broadcasts the packet further.

2.5 Packet Encryption And Decryption

   SILC packets are encrypted almost entirely.  Only small part of SILC
   header is not encrypted as described in section 5.2 SILC Packet Header.
   The SILC Packet header is the first part of a packet to be encrypted
   and it is always encrypted with the key of the next receiver of the
   packet.  The data payload area of the packet is always entirely
   encrypted and it is usually encrypted with the next receiver's key.
   However, there are some special packet types and packet payloads
   that require special encryption process.  These special cases are
   described in the next sections.  First is described the normal packet
   encryption process.


2.5.1 Normal Packet Encryption And Decryption

   Normal SILC packets are encrypted with the session key of the next
   receiver of the packet.  The entire SILC Packet header and the packet
   data payload is is also encrypted with the same key.  Padding of the
   packet is also encrypted always with the session key, also in special
   cases.  Computed MAC of the packet must not be encrypted.

   Decryption process in these cases are straightforward.  The receiver
   of the packet must first decrypt the SILC Packet header, or some parts
   of it, usually first 16 bytes of it.  Then the receiver checks the
   packet type from the decrypted part of the header and can determine
   how the rest of the packet must be decrypted.  If the packet type is
   any of the special cases described in following sections the packet
   decryption is special.  If the packet type is not among those special
   packet types rest of the packet may be decrypted with the same key.

   Also, note that two bytes of the SILC Packet header are not encrypted
   thus it must be noticed in the decryption process by starting the
   decryption from the second byte of the header.  This sets some rules
   to padding generation as well, see the section 2.7 Packet Padding
   Generation.

   With out a doubt, this sort of decryption processing causes some
   overhead to packet decryption, but never the less, is required.


2.5.2 Channel Message Encryption And Decryption

   Channel Messages (Channel Message Payload) are always encrypted with
   the channel specific key.  However, the SILC Packet header is not
   encrypted with that key.  As in normal case, the header is encrypted
   with the key of the next receiver of the packet, who ever that might
   be.  Note that in this case the encrypted data area is not touched



Riikonen                                                       [Page 37]

Internet Draft                                              28 June 2000


   at all; it must not be re-encrypted with the session key.

   Receiver of a channel message, who ever that is, is required to decrypt
   the SILC Packet header to be able to even recognize the packet to be as
   channel message.  This is same procedure as for normal SILC packets.
   As the receiver founds the packet to be channel message, rest of the
   packet processing is special.  Rest of the SILC Packet header is
   decrypted with the same session key along with the padding of the
   packet.  After that the packet is protected with the channel specific
   key and hence can be decrypted only if the receiver is the client on
   the channel.  See section 2.7 Packet Padding Generation for more
   information about padding on special packets.

   If the receiver of the channel message is router who is routing the
   message to another router then it must decrypt the Channel Message
   payload.  Between routers (that is, between cells) channel messages
   are protected with session keys shared between the routers.  This
   causes another special packet processing for channel messages.  If
   the channel message is received from another router then the entire
   packet, including Channel Message payload, is encrypted with the
   session key shared between the routers.  In this case the packet
   decryption process is as with normal SILC packets.  Hence, if the
   router is sending channel message to another router the Channel
   Message payload must have been decrypted and must be re-encrypted
   with the session key shared between the another router.  In this
   case the packet encryption is as with any normal SILC packet.

   It must be noted that this is only when the channel messages are sent
   from router to another router.  In all other cases the channel
   message encryption and decryption is as described above.  This
   different processing of channel messages with router to router
   connection is because channel keys are cell specific.  All cells has
   their own channel keys thus the channel message traveling from one
   cell to another must be protected as it would be any normal SILC
   packet.


2.5.3 Private Message Encryption And Decryption

   By default, private message in SILC are protected by session keys.
   In this case the private message encryption and decryption process is
   equivalent to normal packet encryption and decryption.

   However, private messages can be protected with private message key
   which causes the packet to be special packet.  The procedure in this
   case is very much alike to channel packets.  The actual private message
   is encrypted with the private message key and other parts of the
   packet is encrypted with the session key.  See 2.7 Packet Padding



Riikonen                                                       [Page 38]

   Generation for more information about padding on special packets.

   The difference from channel message processing is that server or router
   en route never decrypts the actual private message, as it does not
   have the key to do that.  Thus, when sending packets between router
   the processing is same as in any other case as well; the packet's header
   and padding is protected by the session key and the data area is not
   touched.

   The true receiver of the private message, client, that is, is able
   to decrypt the private message as it shares the key with the sender
   of the message.


2.6 Packet MAC Generation

   Data integrity of a packet is protected by including a message
   authentication code (MAC) at the end of the packet.  The MAC is computed
   from shared secret MAC key, that is established by the SILC Key Exchange
   protocol, and from the original contents of the packet.  The MAC is
   always computed before the packet is encrypted, although after it is
   compressed if compression is used.

   The MAC is computed from entire packet.  Every bit of data in the packet,
   including SILC Packet Header is used in the MAC computing.  This way
   the entire packet becomes authenticated.

   If the packet is special packet MAC is computed from the entire packet
   but part of the packet may be encrypted before the MAC is computed.
   This is case, for example, with channel messages where the message data
   is encrypted with key that server may not now.  In this case the MAC
   has been computed from the encrypted data.

   See [SILC1] for defined and allowed MAC algorithms.


2.7 Packet Padding Generation

   Padding is needed in the packet because the packet is encrypted.  It
   must always be multiple by eight (8) or multiple by the size of the
   cipher's block size, which ever is larger.  The padding is always
   encrypted.

   For normal packets the padding is added after the SILC Packet Header
   and between the Data Payload area.  The padding for normal packets
   are calculated as follows:

      padding length = 16 - ((packet length - 2) % 16)



Riikonen                                                       [Page 39]

Internet Draft                                              28 June 2000


   The 16 is the maximum padding allowed in SILC packet.  Two (2) is
   subtracted from the true length of the packet because two (2) bytes
   is not encrypted in SILC Packet Header, see section 2.2 SILC Packet
   Header.  Those two bytes that are not encrypted must not be calculated
   to the padding length.

   For special packets the padding calculation may be different as special
   packets may be encrypted differently.  In these cases the encrypted
   data area must already be multiple by the block size thus in this case
   the padding is calculated only for SILC Packet Header, not for any
   other area of the packet.  The same algorithm works in this case as
   well, except that the `packet length' is now the SILC Packet Header
   length.  In this case, as well, two (2) is subtracted from the
   length.

   The padding must be random data, preferably, generated by
   cryptographically strong random number generator.


2.8 Packet Compression

   SILC Packets may be compressed.  In this case the data payload area
   is compressed and all other areas of the packet must remain as they
   are.  After compression is performed for the data area, the length
   field of Packet Header must be set to the compressed length of the
   data.

   The compression must always be applied before encryption.  When
   the packet is received and decrypted the data area must be decompressed.
   Note that the true sender of the packet must apply the compression and
   the true receiver of the packet must apply the decompression.  Any
   server or router en route must not decompress the packet.


2.9 Packet Sending

   The sender of the packet must assemble the SILC Packet Header with
   correct values.  It must set the Source ID of the header as its own
   ID.  It must also set the Destination ID of the header to the true
   destination.  If the destination is client it will be Client ID, if
   it is server it will be Server ID and if it is channel it will be
   Channel ID.

   If the sender wants to compress the packet it must apply the
   compression now.  Sender must also compute the padding as described
   in above sections.  Then sender must compute the MAC of the packet.

   Then sender encrypts the packet as has been described in above



Riikonen                                                       [Page 40]

Internet Draft                                              28 June 2000


   sections according whether the packet is normal packet or special
   packet.  The computed MAC must not be encrypted.


2.10 Packet Reception

   On packet reception the receiver must check that all fields in the
   SILC Packet Header are valid sain.  It must check the flags of the
   header and act accordingly.  It must also check the MAC of the packet
   and if it is to be failed the packet must be discarded.  Also if the
   header of the packet includes any bad fields the packet must be
   discarded.

   See above sections on the decryption process of the received packet.

   The receiver must also check that the ID's in the header are valid
   ID's.  Unsupported ID types or malformed ID's must cause packet
   rejection.  The padding on the reception is always ignored.

   The receiver must also check the packet type and start parsing the
   packet according to the type.  However, note the above sections on
   special packet types and their parsing.


2.11 Packet Broadcasting

   SILC packets may be broadcasted in SILC network.  However, only router
   server may send or receive broadcast packets.  Client and normal server
   must not send broadcast packets and they must ignore broadcast packets
   if they receive them.  Broadcast packets are sent by setting Broadcast
   flag to the SILC packet header.

   Broadcasting packets means that the packet is sent to all routers in
   the SILC network, except to the router that sent the packet.  The router
   receiving broadcast packet must send the packet to its primary route.
   The fact that SILC routers may have several router connections may
   cause problems, such as race conditions inside the SILC network, if
   care is not taken when broadcasting packets.  Router must not send
   the broadcast packet to any other route except to its primary route.

   If the primary route of the router is the original sender of the packet
   the packet must not be sent to the primary route.  This may happen
   if router has several router connections and some other router uses
   the router as its primary route.

   Routers use broadcast packets to broadcast for example information
   about newly registered clients, servers, channels etc. so that all the
   routers may keep these informations up to date.

2.12 Packet Routing

   Routers are the primary entities in the SILC network that takes care
   of packet routing.  However, normal servers routes packets as well, for
   example, when they are routing channel message to the local clients.
   Routing is quite simple as every packet tells the true origin and the
   true destination of the packet.

   It is still recommended for routers that has several routing connections
   to create route cache for those destinations that has faster route than
   the router's primary route.  This information is available for the router
   when other router connects to the router.  The connecting party then
   sends all of its locally connected clients, server and channels.  These
   informations helps to create the route cache.  Also, when new channels
   are created to a cell its information is broadcasted to all routers
   in the network.  Channel ID's are based on router's ID thus it is easy
   to create route cache based on these informations.  If faster route for
   destination does not exist in router's route cache the packet must be
   routed to the primary route (default route).

   For server who receives a packet to be routed to its locally connected
   client the server must check whether the particular packet type is
   allowed to be routed to the client.  Not all packets may be sent by
   some odd entity to client that is indirectly connected to the sender.
   See section 2.3 SILC Packet Types and paragraph about indirectly connected
   entities and sending packets to them.  The section mentions the packets
   that may be sent to indirectly connected entities.  It is clear that some
   server cannot send, for example, disconnect packet to client that is not
   directly connected to the server.


2.13 Packet Tunneling

   Tunneling is a feature that is available in SILC protocol.  Tunneling
   means that extra SILC Packet Header is applied to the original packet
   and thus hiding the original packet entirely.  There can be some
   interesting applications using tunneling, such as, using ID's based on
   private network IP addresses inside in the tunneled packet.  This can
   open many interesting features relating to connecting to private network
   from the Internet with SILC and many more.  However, this feature is
   optional currently in SILC as there does not exist thorough analysis of
   this feature.  It is with out a doubt that there will be many more
   applications that has not yet been discovered.  Thus, it is left
   to Internet Community to investigate the use of tunneling in SILC
   protocol.  This document is updated according those investigations
   and additional documents on the issue may be written.

3 Security Considerations

   Security is central to the design of this protocol, and these security
   considerations permeate the specification.
