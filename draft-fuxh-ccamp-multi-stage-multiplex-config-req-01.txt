Requirement for Multi Stages Multiplexing Configuration in G.709 Optical
                           Transport Network
          draft-fuxh-ccamp-multi-stage-multiplex-config-req-01

Abstract

   Interworking between regions with 1.25G TS and 2.5G TS has been
   considered in G.709.  Multi stages multiplexing/demultiplexing would
   be desirable to facilitate the introduction of new ODU0 and ODUflex
   signals to an existing network without having to upgrade every node
   in the network.  So ODU0/ODUflex can be mapped into ODU1/ODU2/ODU3
   and transit across the 2.5G TS region.

   Multi stages multiplexing/demultiplexing are also used to support the
   multi-domain OTN applications based on the tunnel design.  If there
   are a large number of circuits that share the same endpoints (or even
   part of an overall path), it may be convenient from a management
   perspective to first multiplex those ODU0, ODU1 and ODUflex into ODU2
   or ODU3 to minimize the number of connections that need to be made in
   intermediate nodes.  The ODU2/ODU3 effectively creates a tunnel
   through the ODU4 network that the ODU0, ODU1 and ODUflex can use.

   This document describes the requirement of multi stages multiplexing
   configuration assocaited with some specific scenarios in G.709
   Optical Transport Network.

Internet-Draft   Multi Stages Multiplexing Configuration       July 2010


1.  Introduction

   G.709 has supported a single stage of ODU multiplexing.  The
   practical consequence of this in OTN v1 is an ODU1 can be mapped
   directly to a tributary slot of an ODU3, without having to be first
   mapped into an ODU2.  The motivation for this architecture is
   reducing complexity.  In the normal progression of things, new
   additions to the OTN were expected to be at faster bit rates, and
   thus the single stage concept could be easily maintained going
   forward.

   The introduction of ODU0 and ODUflex to the OTN hierarchy creates a
   situation where the newly added ODUk signals have a bit rate that is
   lower than any of the existing signals, which presents some different
   challenges because the new signals can be clients of the existing
   signals.  As a result, there are clear applications where multi
   stages of multiplexing would be desirable to facilitate the
   introduction of these new ODU0 and ODUflex signals to an existing
   network without having to upgrade every node in the network.  Using
   multi stages of multiplexing allows the operator to confine the new
   rates to only those nodes that need to support them.

   A second potential application for multi stages outside of an upgrade
   scenario would be the carrier-carrier, regional-national core
   interconnection cases or network design based on tunnels.  Multi
   stages multiplexing are used to support these multi-domain OTN
   applications.

   This document describes the requirement for multi stages multiplex
   configuration in G.709 Optical Transport Network.  There are multi-
   stage multiplexing application for some specific scenarios, but it is
   not a general requirement.  This document just havs to associate the
   requirement with specific scenarios.


2.  Typical Use Case

   There may be two use cases to use multi stages multiplexing.  But
   this document doesn't imply restrictions to scenarios for multi
   stages multiplexing.  It just gives some examples of how the multi
   stage multiplexing can be used in the OTN network.

   o  interworking 1.25G TS and 2.5G TS OTN networks.

   o  carrier-carrier and regional-national core interconnection cases,
      or network design based on tunnels.

2.1.  Multi Stages Multiplexing Configuration Requirement for
      Interworking Between Regions with 1.25G TS and 2.5G TS

   In Figure 1, node 4, 5, 6 and 7 have ODU1 and ODU2 switching
   capability.  All nodes only support 2.5G TS granularity.  They can't
   support ODU0/ODUflex directly.  They could not have any visibility to
   the ODU0/ODUflex.

                                 Figure 1

   In Figure 2, operator deploys three new 10G OTN networks, such as
   ODU2 Network 1, ODU 2 Network 3 and ODU2 Network 4.  All ODU2
   networks are interconnected with ODU3 network by OTU3 link.  All
   nodes of three ODU2 networks support the 1.25G TS granularity and are
   based on G.709 v3.  All nodes in ODU2 Network 1 and ODU2 Network 4
   can support ODU0, ODU1 and ODUflex switching capability.  ODU2
   Network 3 is only desirable to support GigE and ODUflex services, so
   all nodes in ODU2 Network 3 only support ODU0 and ODUflex for more
   economical cost.  It doesn't support ODU1 (e.g., STM-16) application.

                                 Figure 2

   There are clear applications where 2 stages of multiplexing within
   one port would be desirable to facilitate the introduction of these
   new ODU0 and ODUflex signals to an existing network without having to
   upgrade every node in the network.  In order for the interworking
   between 1.25G TS and 2.5G TS networks, there must be some nodes which
   support multi stages multiplexing/demultiplexing to allow ODU0/
   ODUflex to be supported across the legacy network.  For example, ODU0
   is mapped first to ODU1 or ODU2, and that ODU1/2 is then mapped into
   ODU3.  Nodes in the legacy network switch the ODU1/ODU2 without
   having any visibility to the ODU0/ODUflex.  Whether ODU1 or ODU2
   should be created for end-to-end ODU0 service depends on multi stages
   multiplexing capability.  Different nodes may support different multi
   stages multiplexing capabilities based on the network planning and
   the capability of network element.

   G1 is supposed to support the following multi stages multiplexing/
   demultiplexing capability.

   o  ODU0-ODU1-ODU3

   o  ODU0-ODU2-ODU3

   o  ODU1-ODU2-ODU3

   o  ODUflex-ODU2-ODU3

   G3 is supposed to support the following multi stages multiplexing/
   demultiplexing capability.

   o  ODU0-ODU2-ODU3

   o  ODUflex-ODU2-ODU3

   G4 is supposed to support the following multi stages multiplexing/
   demultiplexing capability.  The operator limits the ODUflex
   application to the local network.  There is no any multi-domain
   ODUflex application which goes into ODU2 Network 4 and vice versa.
   So it doesn't need to support the ODUflex-ODU2-ODU3 multiplexing.

   o  ODU0-ODU1-ODU3

   o  ODU0-ODU2-ODU3

   There are several end-to-end services being provisioned by operator.

   o  E2E ODUflex 1 (e.g., 6*1.25G TS): It transit 1, 3, G1, 4, 6, 7, G3
      and 8.

   o  E2E GigE 1: It transit 1, 3, G1, 4, 6, 7, G3, 9 and 10.

   o  E2E GigE 2: It transit 2, G1, 4, 5, G4, 11 and 12.

   o  E2E STM-16 1: It transit 1, 2, G1, 4, 5, G4 and 13.

   The E2E ODUflex 1 (e.g., 6*1.25G TS) and GigE 1 services share the
   same ODU2 tunnel between G1 and G3.  Multi stages multiplexing/
   demultiplexing capability must be configured with ODU0-ODU2-ODU3 in
   G1 and G3 for GigE 1 service.  Multi stages multiplexing/
   demultiplexing capability must be configured with ODUflex-ODU2-ODU3
   in G1 and G3 for ODUflex 1 service.  There is an ODU 1 tunnel between
   G4 and G1 for the E2E GigE 2 service.  Multi stages multiplexing/
   demultiplexing capability must be configured with ODU0-ODU1-ODU3 in
   G1 and G4 for GigE 2 service.  There is no any need to configure
   multi stages multiplexing/demultiplexing for E2E STM-16 1 service.

2.2.  Multi Stages Multiplexing Configuration Requirement for Multi-
      Domain OTN Applications

   In Figure 3, operator deploys three new OTN networks again, such as
   ODU2 Network 5, ODU3 Network 7 and ODU4 Network 6.  ODU2 network 5
   and ODU3 network 7 are interconnected with ODU4 network by OTU4 link.
   All nodes of three new OTN networks support the 1.25G TS granularity
   and are based on the G.709 v3.  All nodes in ODU2 Network 5 support
   ODU0, ODU1 and ODUflex switching capability.  All nodes in ODU3
   Network 7 support ODU0, ODU1, ODUflex and ODU2 switching capability.
   All nodes in ODU4 Network 6 only support ODU2 and ODU3 switching
   capability.

   In an ODU4 network, there are 80 tributary slots per ODU4.  Suppose
   there are a large number of multi-domain ODU0 and ODUflex demands.
   If these multi-domain service share the same endpoints (or even part
   of an overall path), it may be convenient from a management
   perspective to first multiplex those ODU0 and ODUflex into ODU2 or
   ODU3 to minimize the number of connections that need to be made in
   intermediate nodes.  It also minimizes managed entities made in core
   network and support carrier's carrier application.  The ODU2/ODU3
   effectively creates a tunnel through the ODU4 network that the ODU0,
   ODU1 and ODUflex can use.

   In order for the tunnel network design, there must be some nodes
   which support ODU0, ODU1 and ODUflex to be mapped into ODU2/ODU3
   first and that ODU2/ODU3 is then mapped into ODU4.

   G7 is supposed to support the following multi stages multiplexing/
   demultiplexing capability.  The operator limits the ODU1 application
   to the local network.  There is no any multi-domain ODU1 application
   which goes into ODU3 Network 7 and vice versa.  It doesn't need to
   support the ODU1-ODU2-ODU4 and ODU1-ODU3-ODU4 multiplexing.

   G2 provides demultiplexing to recover the ODU2 from ODU4 and an
   additional multiplexing of the ODU2 to ODU3 and vice versa.

   There are several E2E services.

   o  E2E ODUflex 2 (e.g., 10*1.25G TS): It transit 16, G5, 17, 19, 20,
      G7, 22 and 23.

   o  E2E GigE 3: It transit 14, 15, G5, 17, 19, 20, G7 and 21.

   o  E2E GigE 4: It transit 15, G5, 17, 18, G2, 6, 7, G3, 9 and 10.

   o  E2E STM-16 2: It transit 15, G5, 17, 18, G2, 6, 4, G1, 3.

   In Figure 3, the E2E ODUflex 2 (e.g., 10*1.25G TS) and GigE 3
   services share the same ODU3 tunnel between G5 and G7.  Multi stages
   multiplexing/demultiplexing capability must be configured with ODU0-
   ODU3-ODU4 in G5 and G7 for GigE 3 service.  Multi stages
   multiplexing/demultiplexing capability must be configured with
   ODUflex-ODU3-ODU4 in G5 and G7 for ODUflex 2 service.

   There is an ODU 2 tunnel between G5 and G3 for the E2E GigE 4

   service.  Multi stages multiplexing/demultiplexing capability must be
   configured with ODU0-ODU2-ODU4 in G5 for GigE 4 service.  Multi
   stages multiplexing/demultiplexing capability must be configured with
   ODU0-ODU2-ODU3 in G3 for GigE 4 service.

   There is an ODU 2 tunnel between G5 and G1 for the E2E STM-16 2
   service.  Multi stages multiplexing/demultiplexing capability must be
   configured with ODU1-ODU2-ODU4 in G5 for STM-16 2 service.  Multi
   stages multiplexing/demultiplexing capability must be configured with
   ODU1-ODU2-ODU3 in G1 for STM-16 2 service.


3.  Requirement for Multi Stages Multiplexing Configuration

3.1.  Requirement in the level of the Data Plane

   This section describes the basic requirements in the Data Plane to
   support the multi stages multiplexing configuration functions of this
   document.  In order to introduce new ODU0 and ODUflex signals to an
   existing network and support multi-domain OTN application based on
   network tunnel design, if some nodes are designed to support multi
   stages multiplexing capability, following requirement for these node
   should be satisfied.

   o  If these nodes can support different multi stages multiplexing
      hierarchy (e.g., two or three stages, and so on) and multiple
      multi stages multiplexing capabilities.  They must support the
      multi stages multiplexing configuration from Management Plane
      and/or Control Plane.  They must support to check the local data
      plane capability to see if this kind of multi stages multiplexing/
      demultiplexing from MP and/or CP is acceptable on specific
      interface.

3.2.  Requirement in the level of Control Plane and Management Plane

   This section describes the basic requirements for MP and CP to
   perform the multi stages multiplexing configuration.

   o  Management Plane:

      *  From the perspective of Management Plane, it must get multi
         stages multiplexing/demultiplexing capability of each nodes for
         the service provision.

      *  Management Plane must support to config the multi stages
         multiplexing hierarchy which is determined by path computation
         entity into the Data Plane for the E2E service.

   o  Control Plane:

      *  From the perspective of Control Plane, it must get multi stages
         multiplexing/demultiplexing capability of each nodes for path
         computation.  It can get multi stages multiplexing/
         demultiplexing information by Management Plane configuration.
         Path computation entity can also use the IGP protocol or
         configurations from Management Plane to get these information.

      *  Path computation element must select a proper kind of multi
         stages multiplexing/demultiplexing hierarchy of nodes along a
         specific E2E connection.

      *  Signaling message must carry the multi stages multiplexing/
         demultiplexing hierarchy that has been determined by path
         computation entity.  Multi stages multiplexing/demultiplexing
         hierarchy for a specific service must be configured to data
         plane after the node which needs to be support multi stages
         multiplexing receives the signaling of service creation.


4.  Security Considerations

   The use of control plane protocols for signaling, routing, and path
   computation opens an OTN to security threats through attacks on those
   protocols.  The data plane technology for an OTN does not introduce
   any specific vulnerabilities, and so the control plane may be secured
   using the mechanisms defined for the protocols discussed.  For
   further details of the specific security measures refer to the
   documents that define the protocols ([RFC3473], [RFC4203], [RFC4205],
   [RFC4204], and [RFC5440]).  [GMPLS-SEC] provides an overview of
   security vulnerabilities and protection mechanisms for the GMPLS
   control plane.


5.  IANA Considerations

   TBD
