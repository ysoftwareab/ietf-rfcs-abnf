                  draft-ietf-teas-lsp-attribute-ro-01

Abstract

   RFC5420 extends RSVP-TE to specify or record generic attributes which
   apply to the whole of the path of an LSP.  This document proposes an
   extension to the RSVP ERO and RRO objects to allow it to specify or
   record generic attributes which apply to a given hop.

1.  Introduction

   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched
   Paths (LSPs) can be route-constrained by making use of the Explicit
   Route object (ERO) and related sub-objects as defined in [RFC3209],
   [RFC3473], [RFC3477], [RFC4873], [RFC4874], [RFC5520] and [RFC5553].
   Several documents have identified the need for attributes that can be
   targeted at specific hops in the path of an LSP, including [RFC6163],
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-wson-signaling], [I-D.ietf-teas-rsvp-te-li-lb] or
   [I-D.ali-ccamp-rc-objective-function-metric-bound].  This document
   provides a generic mechanism for use by these other documents.

   RSVP already supports generic extension of LSP Attributes in
   [RFC5420].  In order to support current and future ERO constraint
   extensions this document defines a mechanism to define per-Hop
   attributes.

   The document describes a generic mechanism for carrying information
   related to specific nodes when signaling an LSP.  This document does

Internet-Draft         General ERO LSP parameters          December 2014


   not restrict what that information can be used for.  The defined
   approach builds on LSP Attributes defined in [RFC5420], and enables
   attributes to be expressed in ERO and Secondary Explicit Route object
   (SERO) objects.  A new ERO sub-object is defined, containing a list
   of generic per-Hop attributes.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  ERO Hop Attributes Subobject

   The ERO Hop Attributes subobject may be carried in the ERO or SERO
   object if they are present.  The subobject uses the standard format
   of an ERO subobject.

2.1.  Encoding

   The length is variable and content is a list of HOP Attributes TLVs
   defined in Section 2.2.  The size of the ERO sub-object limits the
   size of the attribute TLV to 250 bytes.  The typical size of
   currently defined and forthcoming LSP_ATTRIBUTE TLVs applicable to a
   specific hop (WSON_SIGNALING, Objective Function (OF) and Metric) is
   not foreseen to exceed this limit.

   The ERO Hop Attributes subobject is defined as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |L|    Type     |     Length    |    Reserved                 |R|
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                                                               |
      //                      Attributes TLVs                        //
      |                                                               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The L, Type and Length parameters are as defined in [RFC3209] section
   4.3.3.  The L bit MUST be set to 0.  The Type for the ERO Hop
   Attributes subobject is TBA by IANA.  The attributes TLV are encoded
   as defined in section Section 2.2.

   Reserved  Reserved, MUST be set to 0 when the subobject is inserted
      in the ERO, MUST NOT be changed when a node processes the ERO and

      MUST be ignored on the node addressed by the preceding ERO
      subobjects.

   R  This bit reflects the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTE and LSP_ATTRIBUTE
      semantic defined in [RFC5420].  When set it indicates required hop
      attributes to be processed by the node.  When cleared, it
      indicates that the hop attributes are not required as described in
      Section Section 2.3.

   Attributes TLVs  as defined in Section 2.2 .

2.2.  HOP Attributes TLVs

   ERO Attributes carried by the new objects defined in this document
   are encoded within TLVs.  One or more TLVs MAY be present in each
   object.  There are no ordering rules for TLVs, and interpretation
   SHOULD NOT be placed on the order in which TLVs are received.  The
   TLV format is defined in [RFC5420] section 3.

2.3.  Procedures

   As described in [RFC3209] and [RFC3473] the ERO is managed as a list
   where each hop information starts with a subobject identifying an
   abstract node or link.  The ERO Hop Attributes subobject MUST be
   appended after the existing subobjects defined in [RFC3209],
   [RFC3473], [RFC3477], [RFC4873], [RFC4874], [RFC5520] and [RFC5553].
   Several ERO Hop Attributes subobject MAY be present, for each hop.

   If a node is processing an ERO Hop Attributes subobject and does not
   support handling of the subobject it will behave as described in
   [RFC3209] when an unrecognized ERO subobject is encountered.  This
   node will return a PathErr with error code "Routing Error" and error
   value "Bad EXPLICIT_ROUTE object" with the EXPLICIT_ROUTE object
   included, truncated (on the left) to the offending unrecognized
   subobject.

   When the R bit is set a node MUST examine the attribute TLV present
   in the subobject following the rules described in [RFC5420] section
   5.2.  When the R bit is not set a node MUST examine the attribute TLV
   present in the subobject following the rules described in [RFC5420]
   section 4.2.

   A node processing an ERO Hop Attributes subobject with an HOP
   Attributes TLV longer than the ERO subobject SHOULD return a PathErr
   with error code "Routing Error" and error value "Bad EXPLICIT_ROUTE
   object" with the EXPLICIT_ROUTE object included, truncated (on the
   left) to the offending malformed subobject.  A processing node MUST
   NOT originates a HOP Attributes TLV longer than the ERO HOP

   Attributes Subobject.  The processing of the Hop attribute TLVs
   SHOULD be described in the documents defining them.

3.  RRO Hop Attributes Subobject

   In some cases it is important to determine if an optional Hop
   attribute has been processed by a node.

3.1.  Encoding

   The RRO Hop Attributes subobject may be carried in the RECORD_ROUTE
   object if it is present.  The subobject uses the standard format of
   an RRO subobject.

   The RRO Hop Attributes subobject is defined as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |      Type     |     Length    |    Reserved                   |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                                                               |
      //                      Attributes TLVs                        //
      |                                                               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The Type and Length parameters are as defined in [RFC3209] section
   4.4.1.  The Type for the RRO Hop Attributes subobject is TBA by IANA.
   The attributes TLV are encoded as defined in section Section 2.2.

   Reserved  Reserved, must be set to 0 when the subobject is inserted
      in the RRO, MUST NOT be changed when a node process the RRO and
      must be ignored on the node addressed by the preceding RRO
      subobjects.

   Attributes TLVs  The processed or addition HOP Attributes, using the
      format defined in Section 2.2 .

3.2.  Procedures

3.2.1.  Subobject presence rule

   The RRO rules defined in [RFC3209] are not changed.  The RRO Hop
   Attributes subobject MUST be pushed after the RRO Attributes
   subobject (if present) defined in in [RFC5420].  The RRO Hop
   Attributes subobject MAY be present between a pair of subobjects




Margaria, et al.          Expires July 3, 2015                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft         General ERO LSP parameters          December 2014


   identifying Label Switching Router (LSR) or links.  All such
   subobjects MUST be forwarded unmodified by transit LSRs.

3.2.2.  Reporting Compliance with ERO Hop Attributes

   To report that an ERO Hop attribute has been considered, or to report
   an additional attribute, an LSR MAY add a RRO Hop Attributes
   subobject with the HOP Attribute TLV which describes the attribute to
   be reported.  The requirement to report compliance MUST be specified
   in the document that defines the usage of an Hop attribute.

3.2.3.  Compatibility with RRO Attributes subobject

   The RRO Hop Attributes subobject extends the capability of the RRO
   Attributes subobject defined in [RFC5420] section 7.2 by allowing the
   node to report the attribute value.  The mechanism defined in this
   document is compatible with the RRO Attributes subobject using the
   following procedures.

   For LSP attributes signaled in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES or
   LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES objects, a node SHOULD use the RRO Attributes
   subobject to report processing of those attributes.

   For LSP attributes signaled in the ERO Hop Attributes subobject and
   not in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES or LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES objects, if a
   node desires to report the attributes, it SHOULD use the RRO Hop
   Attributes subobject and SHOULD NOT use the RRO Attributes subobject.
   Ingress nodes not supporting the RRO Hop Attributes subobject will
   drop the information, as described in [RFC3209] section 4.4.5.

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  ERO LSP Attribute Subobject

   IANA manages the "RSVP PARAMETERS" registry located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/rsvp-parameters/rsvp-parameters.xml.
   We request IANA to make an allocation in the Sub-object type 20
   EXPLICIT_ROUTE - Type 1 Explicit Route registry.

   This document introduces a new ERO sub-object:

             Value  Description       Reference
             ------ ----------------- ------------------------
             TBA    Hop Attributes    This document, Section 2

4.2.  RRO LSP Attribute Subobject

   IANA manages the "RSVP PARAMETERS" registry located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/rsvp-parameters/rsvp-parameters.xml.
   We request IANA to make an allocation in the Sub-object type 21
   ROUTE_RECORD - Type 1 Route Record registry.

             Value  Description       Reference
             ------ ----------------- ------------------------
             TBA    Hop Attributes    This document, Section 3

4.3.  Existing LSP Attribute TLVs

   IANA manages the "RSVP-TE PARAMETERS" registry located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/rsvp-te-parameters/rsvp-te-
   parameters.xml.  The "Attributes TLV Space" registry manage the
   following attributes, as defined in [RFC5420]:

   o  TLV Type (T-field value)

   o  TLV Name

   o  Whether allowed on LSP_ATTRIBUTES object

   o  Whether allowed on LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object

   We request IANA to add the following information for each TLV in the
   RSVP TLV type identifier registry.

   o  Whether allowed on LSP Hop Attributes ERO subobject

   The existing registry is modified for existing TLVs as follows: The
   following abbreviation are used in the table:

   LSP_A  Whether allowed on LSP_ATTRIBUTES object.

   LSP_RA  Whether allowed on LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object.

   HOP_A  Whether allowed on LSP Hop Attributes subobject.

           T Name                  LSP_A LSP_RA HOP_A Ref.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document adds new subobject in the EXPLICIT_ROUTE and the
   ROUTE_RECORD object carried in RSVP message used in MPLS and GMPLS
   signaling.  It builds on mechanism defined in [RFC3209] and [RFC5420]
   and does not introduce any new security.  The existing security
   considerations described in [RFC2205], [RFC3209], [RFC3473] and
   [RFC5420] do apply.

   As any RSVP-TE signaling request, the procedures defined in this
   document permit the transfer and reporting of functional preferences
   on specific node.  This may reveal information about the LSP request
   and status to anyone with unauthorized access.  The mechanism
   described in this document do not contribute to this issue, which can
   be only resolved by encrypting the content of the whole signaling
   message.

   In addition the reporting of attributes using the RRO may reveal
   details about the node that the operator wishes to remains
   confidential.  The same strategy and policies that apply to other RRO
   subobjects also apply to this new mechanism.  It is recommended that
   domain boundary policies take the releasing of RRO hop attributes
   into consideration.
