Abstract

   This contribution defines the optical multicast concepts and the
   related applications in optical networks. The objective is to extend
   the multicast concept for transparent and all-optical networks and
   subsequently the definition of the signalling protocol extensions
   for optical multicast-capable networks.

1. Introduction

   As proposed in the contribution OIF2001.067 [1] and already
   presented during the last IETF meeting in San Diego [2], we develop

   in the current contribution the basic concepts and future
   developments needed in the design of optical multicast-capable
   networks.

   The concept of multicast has been widely discussed for packetû
   oriented networks. This proposal extends the multicast concept to
   optical networks, which provide enhanced performance for, multicast
   as well as broadcast packet-based applications.

   The architecture of optical networks needs to balance potentially
   conflicting design and performance criteria, including:
   - Minimizing the number of hops traversed
   - Minimizing some combination of the number of transceivers,
   amplifiers and optical splitters
   - Minimize blocking probability
   - Maximizing the virtual connectivity between nodes of interest
   - Maintaining a reasonable optical power budget
   - Solving the routing and wavelength assignment problem

   This contribution reviews the relationships between these tradeoffs.

   The optical splitter is a key component to realize multicast in
   optical networks. The concept of optical multicast is now becoming
   possible since 1:2 splitters and recently 1:4 splitters are
   available. The distinction between a optical splitter and an optical
   tap is related to the output signal ratio: with a splitter the
   output signal power is equally distributed in contrast with a tap
   the output signal power ratio is not equally distributed.

   Optical multicast refers to point-to-multipoint connections in the
   optical domain also referred to as light-tree.

2. Rationale for Optical Multicast

   The applications that can utilize the optical multicast concept are
   numerous and cover a wide range of current ôclientö needs. These
   applications cover Optical Storage Area Networks (O-SAN), Optical
   Broadband (video, HDTV, etc.) applications, etc.

   Optical multicast offers advantages in the following critical
   aspects of optical networks:
   - Efficient optical (1+1) optical protection
   - Improved performance (no store and forward) compared to packet-
   oriented multicast technology
   - Reduction of the total number of transceivers in the optical
   network.
   - Overall network throughput improvement by reducing the number of
   wavelengths used per fiber link (i.e. minimizing the overall
   bandwidth usage per fiber link)

   However, the major drawback to overcome in optical multicast-capable
   networks is to compensate the power penalty introduced during the
   optical signal splitting.

   Moreover, the multicast problem in communication networks, described
   by the Steiner Tree Problem applied to communication networks is NP-
   Complete [6]. The Steiner Tree Problem is defined as follows. Given
   a Graph G(V,E) where V is a Vertex and E an Edge; a cost function
   applied to each of the edge of the graph G; and a set of node N
   included within the graph G; find a sub-tree T = (V[T], E[T])
   spanning N and such that its cost C (defined as the sum of
   individual edge cost C(E)) is minimized. For more detailed
   explanations concerning this problem and related computational
   aspects, we refer to [14].

   Since the Steiner Tree problem is NP-Complete, some heuristics are
   needed to perform multicast in an efficient way. Consequently, there
   a method to optimize the topology of an optical network exists in
   theory. However, in practice it is not possible to analytically
   solve this optimization and a heuristic approach is required. For
   instance, in packet-based multicast networks, shortest-path trees
   are computed in order to implement a fully distributed on-line
   computation of the ômulticast-treesö.

3. Lightpath and Light-tree Concepts

3.1 Lightpath

   A lightpath is defined is defined in the context of wavelength (or
   optical channel) routing through a wavelength router which also
   referred to as a Photonic Cross-Connect (PXC) within an all-optical
   network or an Optical Cross-Connect within a transparent optical
   network. A unicast connection (i.e. a point-to-point connection) in
   a transparent (all-) optical network is carried on a lightpath
   defined as a transparent (all-optical) channel used to transport
   packets or circuits transparently within the optical network. With
   point-to-point optical channel networks, the number of transmitters
   (TX) needed within the transparent (all-) optical network equals the
   number of receivers (RX).

   Under the wavelength continuity constraint (i.e. in the absence of
   wavelength converters) within transparent optical networks, the
   routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) is the most challenging
   problem. Selecting the best combination of route and wavelength for
   each unicast connection such that the number of lightpaths
   established is maximized and such that two lightpaths sharing a
   common fiber link do not use the same wavelength. However, the
   routing and wavelength assignment problem for unicast connections in
   optical networks has been demonstrated in [4] to be NP-Complete.

3.2 Light-tree

   The concept of a light-tree has been introduced in [3] and
   explicitly refers to point-to-multipoint non-looping optical
   channels established in optical networks. A light-tree is formally
   defined as a directed Steiner tree [7] that is rooted at the source

                 Internet Draft û Expires August 2001                3

                  draft-poj-optical-multicast-00.txt     February 2001


   node and spans all the destinations (each of the nodes providing
   optical multicast function require optical power splitters).

   A light-tree enables an upstream node to have more than one logical
   downstream neighbor. Consequently, the use of optical point-to-
   multipoint in transparent optical networks reduces theoretically the
   number of transmitters compared to the number of receivers. So, one
   of the objective of optical multicast is to minimize the total
   number of transceivers used within the transparent optical network.
   However, in all-optical multicast-capable networks, and per light-
   tree, the number of transmitters equal 1 and the number of receivers
   equal N. So that the optimization of the total number of
   transceivers used applies only to transparent optical networks.

   For the purpose of this memo, we propose to extend the definition
   proposed in [3], by allowing light-tree to also cover shortest-path
   trees.

   For instance, a Steiner tree could represent the light-tree concept
   here below:


                              5                 1
                  F --------------------- G ----------
                  |                       |           |
                  |1                      |1          |
             5    |     1           5     |     1     |
        A ------- B --------- C --------- D --------- E 
                  |           |           |           |
                  |1          |5          |1          |
                  |     5     |     1     |     1     |
                  H --------- I --------- J ----------


   The node A is the root of the following light-tree with equal cost
   nodes, where each of the link cost is indicated, so the resulting
   light-tree has a minimized cost set of paths starting at node A
   reaching each of the leaf (or destination) nodes included in the
   topology. In this example, node D ôexecutesö a form of ôdrop-and-
   continueö function since it terminates one of the output of the
   split signal and continues the other output of the split signal
   toward Node E.

                  |          |          |
                  |          |          |
                  |          |          |
                  H          I----------J

        From A to B: Cost = 5
        From A to C: Cost = 6
        From A to D: Cost = 13
        From A to E: Cost = 14
        Etc.

   If we consider only a subset of destination nodes, for instance D, G
   and J then we obtain the following light-tree (which does not
   correspond to the shortest-path tree):

                  F                       G
                                          |

             5          1           5     |
        A ------- B --------- C --------- D          E 
                                          |
                                          |1
                                          |
                  H           I           J



        From A to D: Cost = 11
        From A to G: Cost = 12
        From A to J: Cost = 12

        Steiner Tree Cost C(E) = 13

   If we had to compute the shortest-path tree for the same group of
   destination nodes we would obtain the following tree:


                              5
                  F --------------------- G
                  |
                  |1
             5    |     1           5
        A ------- B --------- C --------- D          E 
                                          |
                                          |1
                                          |
                                          J


        From A to D: Cost = 11
        From A to G: Cost = 11
        From A to J: Cost = 12

   Note that the node and link cost minimization is only one of the
   possible constraint applicable to an optical multicast-capable

   network. If the jitter accumulation has to be minimized, then a
   shortest-path tree computation can be used for that purpose.

   Consequently, the ôlogical connectivityö of the optical network is
   increased with respect to the number of wavelengths used within the
   optical domain when using point-to-multipoint optical channels (or
   light-trees) which enable communication between a source (root) and
   a set of destination nodes. This in turn increases the overall
   network throughput.

4. Virtual Topologies

   A virtual topology is defined on top of a given physical topology
   (as described in [5]) which by definition is a fixed topology.
   Compared to the packet-oriented sessions established on top of this
   virtual topology, the virtual topology changes are less frequent.
   Moreover, as proposed in [15], a methodology has been described to
   obtain new constraint based virtual topology by simultaneously
   minimizing the changes required to obtain new virtual topology from
   the current virtual topology. However, the proposed technique is up
   to now beyond the scope of this document.

   When considering the following example, the virtual topology can be
   defined as the set of point-to-multipoint connections (S, D) where S
   is the source node (here Node A and Node K). Node A is multicasting
   on wavelength L1 and Node K is multicasting on wavelength L2. In
   this example, the sets of destinations nodes D are Nodes C, F, H, J
   and Nodes B, D, E, G, I respectively since wavelength L1 reaches
   Nodes C, F, H, J and wavelength L2 reaches Nodes B, D, E, G, I.

                            xxxxxxxxxxxx


   Since a light-tree is trivial generalization of lightpath, the set
   of light-tree based virtual topologies is a superset of the set of
   lightpath based virtual topologies. Therefore, an ôoptimumö light-
   tree based virtual topology is guaranteed to have better performance
   than an ôoptimumö lightpath based virtual topology.

   Consequently, the optimization problem in optical multicast-capable
   networks can be either the minimization of the number of links
   (distance) on top of the physical network topology or the


                 Internet Draft û Expires August 2001                6

                  draft-poj-optical-multicast-00.txt     February 2001


   minimization of the total number of transceivers in the network (as
   described in section 4).

   However, the routing problem in optical multicast-capable networks
   referred to as multicast-routing and wavelength assignment (MCRWA)
   problem is NP-Complete since it includes the RWA problem which is
   NP-Complete as demonstrated in [4].

5. Optical Splitters and Optical Network Topology

   In an optical multicast network, the splitter is the key hardware
   component. The optical splitter is a passive optical device, which
   enables the splitting of the input signal. A n-way splitter is
   defined as an optical device which equally splits the input signal
   among n outputs, thus reducing the power of each output to (1/n)
   times the original signal power (n value is called the splitting
   ratio). A large number of splitters require a large number of
   optical amplifiers to balance the optical power loss. A special case
   of a light splitter is a tap. A tap does not split equally the power
   of the input signal over the outgoing ports, it only splits of a
   low-power signal.

   Consequently, an optical multicast-capable network will require a
   more detailed power budget computation since any optical power
   splitter introduces optical power loss. So, one of the major
   constraints when designing an optical multicast network is to define
   a design that reduces the number of splitters with minimal effects
   on the network blocking performance. Nevertheless, the optical
   splitters give the capability to split the optical signal without
   any knowledge about the optical characteristics of that signal (BER,
   Q-Factor, etc.). When compared to packet-oriented multicast systems
   such as classical routers, the use of optical splitters allows
   optical networks to support multicasting without store-and-forward.

   As proposed in [8], a power-efficient design methodology is based on
   a two-dimensional design space:
   - The splitter-sharing dimension focused on minimizing the number of
   splitters inside the PXC itself.
   - The splitter-tap dimension focused on minimizing the number of
   multicastûcapable PXCÆs in the overall optical network taking into
   account the blocking probability.

   The splitter-tap problem has been extended to the coarse-grain
   splitter placement optimization problem [9] in optical networks so
   that blocking probability is minimized. The splitter placement
   problem is also NP-complete (since it includes the RWA problem which
   is NP-complete). Note that the most important result obtained in [9]
   is that for a wide variety of optical network topologies and
   different traffic patterns, no more than 50% of the PXCÆs need to
   include optical power splitters. Having more than 50% of PXCÆs with
   multicast-capable hardware only slightly enhances the blocking
   performance of the optical network.

6. Optical Multicast-capable Networks

   Applications of optical multicast are straightforward: it will
   provide efficient dual-homing protection at the O-UNI. The
   application of the optical multicast concept will also facilitate
   the implementation of the Drop-and-Continue functionality between
   optical rings [10]. Other applications of optical multicast at O-UNI
   [IPO-OUNI] as well as the O-NNI [IPO-ONNI] will be detailed in next
   releases of this document. They will be focused on æclassicalÆ
   multicast applications such as HDTV, Video, etc.

   However, as described in [11], the scheduling of multicast traffic
   in an optical multicast-capable network needs to take into account
   two conflicting objectives: low bandwidth utilization at the packet-
   layer and high optical channel capacity utilization. Moreover, as
   stated in [12] more practical traffic patterns and real network
   scenarios must be considered, since in optical network topologies
   both unicast and multicast traffic will be simultaneously present
   within the same optical network. Taking into account these
   considerations is key to a successful deployment of optical
   multicast-capable networks.

7. Signalling in Optical Multicast-capable Networks

   It is widely accepted that point-to-multipoint applications such as
   HDTV and Video Streams will comprise a large portion of the
   multicast application space. The proposed signalling model is
   designed to efficiently handle such cases where sources are well
   known. This is specifically the case with optical multicast were the
   sources S are in most cases well defined (location, address, etc.)

   Signalling in optical multicast-capable networks is realized through
   GMPLS signalling as described in [GMPLS-SIG]. Since an optical
   multicast tree is unidirectional, the suggested label mechanism
   defined for bi-directional LSP setup is not applicable here.

   In this section, a node is independently referred (at the signalling
   plane level) to as a PXC or an OXC or using the GMPLS terminology
   [18] as an LSR. A lightpath is independently referred to as an LSP.

7.1 Optical Network Architecture

   The Optical Cross-Connect (OXC) system architecture for lambda
   switching has been introduced in the [16] and [17]. The OXC
   interfaces considered includes, as described in [18], Lambda Switch
   Capable (LSC) interfaces that switches the lightpath segment based
   on the incoming wavelength and Fiber-Switch Capable (FSC) interfaces
   that switches the lightpath based on the spatial position of the
   incoming data stream in the physical space.

   An OXC has several incoming and outgoing LSC interfaces or ports,
   connected to adjacent OXCÆs, and several incoming and outgoing LSC
   interfaces or ports attached to an edge device that can be a router

   (or any other kind of device supporting termination capable
   interfaces). An OXC includes mainly two functional parts: an OXC
   Switch Controller (OSCtrl) and OXC optical matrix.

   The OSCtrl communicates through Optical Supervisory Channels (OSC)
   i.e. out-of-band signalling transport mechanism or through dedicated
   and physically diverse control network i.e. out-of-network
   signalling transport mechanism. OSCtrlÆs and OSCÆs define the
   signalling plane of the optical network.

   When receiving a signalling message, the OSCtrl translate to an
   internal control command, and sends this command to the OXC optical
   matrix. The commands to control the OXC optical matrix are as
   follows: connect (and disconnect) between an incoming LSC interface
   and an outgoing LSC interface. The OSCtrl is also capable to process
   status requests, lightpath modification requests as well as
   notification messages. The same commands apply when the OXC is
   connected to an LSC capable edge device.

   Based on these commands, a chain of connections through OXCs can
   form a point-to-point optical channel i.e. a lightpath (as described
   in section 3.1). The ingress OXC is the node where the multicast
   tree starts (sender), the egress OXC(s) are the destination nodes
   (receivers) and the OXCs in the middle of the tree are referred to
   as intermediate OXCs.

   An OXC optical matrix receives commands from the OSCtrl, and replies
   whether the command was successful or not. The OSCtrl then converts
   the result into a message that it sends via the OSC channel
   throughout the signalling plane of the optical network.

   To cover any kind of optical network, we consider as specified in
   [16] the following distinction between Optical Cross-Connect (OXC)
   in transparent optical networks and Photonic Cross-Connect (PXC) in
   Optical networks. Basically, OXC devices included within Transparent
   optical networks performs O/E/O conversion at each of their
   interfaces while PXC devices included within optical networks do not
   perform O/E/O conversion at all so they are defined as pure O-O
   devices (including tunable lasers). We consider here that all the
   interfaces of an OXC as well as all the interfaces of a PXC are LSC
   interfaces. Moreover, in order to enable optical multicast
   functionality, OXCs and PXCs must include optical splitters included
   in splitter banks.

   In the remaining parts of this document, nodes are considered as
   optical PXC (so these considerations can also be applied to OXC).

7.2 Shortest-Path Trees

   Typically in packet-networks, multicast routing protocols create
   shortest-path trees.  These trees are non-optimal (as described in
   section 5), but the algorithm is distributed and allows the dynamic
   adding and removal of the multicast tree branches. The mapping of
   these trees onto LSPs is discussed for Protocol Independent
   Multicast (PIM) Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) in [19] and more specifically
   in [20]. PIM Source Specific Multicast (PIM-SSM) extension is an
   extension of PIM-SM.

   We describe in the two sub-sequent sections PIM Sparse Mode (PIM-SM)
   and PIM Source Specific Multicast (PIM-SSM) defined as receiver
   initiated approaches. Nevertheless, one of the key issues with this
   approach is the merging of user signalling-plane with the optical
   signalling-plane when considering a unified service model between
   the edge router and the optical domain.

7.2.1 Source/Share Multicast Trees

   In classical packet multicast [19], IP multicast routing protocols
   create either source trees (S, G), i.e. a tree per source (S) and
   per multicast group (G), or shared trees (*, G), i.e. one tree per
   multicast group (Figure 1).

          Shared tree                          Source trees


   In packet-based multicast-capable networks, the advantage of using
   shared trees, when label switching is applied, is that shared trees
   consume less labels than source trees (1 label per group versus 1
   label per source and per group).

7.2.2 Receiver Initiated Approach - PIM-SM

   PIM Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) constructs a single spanning multicast tree
   rooted at a core rendezvous point (RP) for all group members within
   a given domain. PIM-SM enables to construct unidirectional shared
   trees to forward data from senders to receivers of a multicast
   group. PIM-SM also allows the construction of source specific trees.

   Moreover in [22], PIM-SM (PIMv1 and PIMv2) has been extended to
   combine MPLS label distribution with the distribution of (*,G) join
   state, (S,G) join state, or (S,G) RPT-bit prune state. Note that
   (*,G) join state implications need to be evaluated in optical
   multicast because the elimination of the shared tree concept is the
   key to implementing SSM. This because PIM-SSM eliminates the need
   for starting with a shared tree and then switching to a source-
   specific tree (see section 7.2.3). In PIM-SM MPLS extension, labels
   and multicast routes are sent together in one message. We propose
   here to extend this method for optical multicast-capable networks.
   We will refer to this method as Optical PIM-SM.

   The design described in [22], specifies that Multicast label
   distribution procedures should not depend on the media type. Note
   also that when a multicast routing table change requires a label
   distribution change, the latency between the two should be
   minimized, both to improve performance and to minimize the
   possibility of race conditions.

   On receiving PIM Join/Prune messages from an edge router, a PXC that
   supports optical multicast (i.e. that includes optical splitters)
   sends PIM Join/Prune messages on behalf of hosts that join groups.
   It sends Join/Prune messages to upstream neighboring PXCs toward the
   Rendezvous Point (RP) for the shared-tree (*,G) or toward a source
   for a source-tree (S,G). Wavelength Labels, described in [18], are
   distributed by being associated with IPv4 multicast addresses
   (address issue is considered in section 7.2.3) in the join list or
   the prune list. As described in [23], the label distribution mode is
   thus a downstream-on-demand distribution and the LSP control is
   independent.

   Router R and PXCs are included in the same signalling plane i.e. the
   mechanism described here applies to a unified service model [18]. So
   that the generalization of the mechanism defined in packet
   multicast-capable networks to the optical multicast-capable networks
   need to be considered as described in [22].

7.2.3 Receiver Initiated Approach - PIM-SSM

   Protocol Independent Multicast - Source Specific Multicast (PIM-SSM)
   defines a method of multicast forwarding restricted to shortest path
   trees to specific sources. This method refers to Source-Specific
   Multicast (SSM) service model that supports source-based multicast
   trees. We will refer to this model as PIM-SSM.

   The key difference between PIM-SM and PIM-SSM is that eliminates the
   need for starting with a (*,G) shared tree and then switching to a
   source-specific tree. More precisely, when a DR (for instance, a
   boundary PXC) identifies request to join a specific source in a
   group with a SSM group address (232/8), it always initiates a (S,G)
   join and never a (*,G) join. Moreover, unlike PIM-SM, it need not
   send a (S,G) prune towards the RP.

   PIM-SSM enables that a single source S can transmit to a channel
   (S,G) where G is an PIM-SSM address. Each receiver is capable of
   specifying the specific sources from which it would like to receive
   content. This would in turn enable a direct mapping of PIM-SSM to
   optical multicast.

7.2.4 PIM-SM versus PIM-SSM

   As discussed in the previous sections, shared trees (*,G) join state
   are only used to discover new sources of the group and after a
   switchover to a source tree is performed.

   However, the end-to-end mapping of a (*,G) shared tree implies the
   setup of multipoint-to-multipoint trees (i.e. light-trees). The
   problem is that in the optical domain, labels represent wavelengths
   which are by definition non-mergeable. Consequently, optical
   multipoint-to-multipoint light-trees are not applicable in optical
   multicast since label merging is not feasible.

   Since the difference between PIM-SM and PIM-SSM is that the latter
   eliminates the need for starting with a (*,G) shared tree and then
   switching to a source-specific tree, this restricts the choice to
   PIM-SSM for shortest-path tree receiver initiated approach.

7.3 Non-Shortest-Path Trees

   The shortest-path tree approach could be taken for optical multicast
   but there are several reasons to consider another means:
   @ The diversity of the nodes in optical networks: PXCs without and
     with support for multicast, the latter can be Splitter and
     Delivery (SaDs) or Multicast optical SaDs (MoSads) [8]
   @ The multicast light-trees tend to be more stable (branches added
     and removed sporadically)
   @ Shortest-path trees are not optimal (as described previously)
   @ Internal PXCs might not be aware of global routing information
     (when using an overlay signalling plane), so a PXC wonÆt be able
     to determine where to send a PIM Join if the source S is outside
     of the optical domain
   @ MCRWA constraints (see section 4)

   Because of the above reasons, it might be useful to consider a non-
   shortest-path tree approach combined with an offline traffic-
   engineering tool. This offline tool performs the computation by
   taking into account the variety of constraints set by optical
   networks and that calculates a more optimal tree than the shortest-
   path tree one. Many heuristics exist to approximate e.g. the optimal
   Steiner Tree [18].

   To establish the calculated tree in the network one can use a
   management interface (e.g. SNMP) to every on-tree PXC or one can
   introduce the use of GMPLS signalling protocol [GMPLS-SIG]. The
   latter can be downstream or upstream signalling. So that the non-
   Shortest-Path trees could be either root or receiver initiated.

7.3.1 Root Initiated

   The explicit routing signalling is based on the computation of the
   explicit multicast route from the root to each of the (intermediate)
   destination nodes.

   In the root-initiated case, the signalling flows from root to
   destinations. This approach requires that a multicast tree route
   object [19] is signaled. For instance, if we refer to the previous
   example:

                  F                       G
                                          |
                                          |1
             5          1           5     |
        A ------- B --------- C --------- D          E 
                                          |
                                          |1
                                          |
                  H           I           J


   The explicit multicast tree route that the node A has computed can
   be represented as: A [B [C [D [(G, J)]]]]

   More precisely, as defined in [20], each of the link bundles of a
   PXC can be numbered (by an IPv4 address) or unnumbered (by a Node ID
   and Link bundle index). So that the identification of the nodes can
   be expressed by using the bundle address included within the
   multicast tree.

   The multicast explicit route could be included within the [21]
   Explicit Route TLV (ER-TLV). The content of an ER-TLV is defined as
   a series of variable length ER-Hop TLVs. We consider here ER-Hop
   Type being IPv4 prefix. The IPv4 prefix represents the IP address of
   the link bundle of each node through which the multicast tree need
   to be established. The L bit defines whether the value of the
   attribute is loose. In this case, the value of the attribute is
   strict so that the L bit is not set.

   For an edge router to become a member of a particular optical
   multicast group, the router has to register multicast group
   membership with a specific query to the PXC that handles the
   multicast group membership. Protocol like IGMP could be used for
   that purpose. Multicast-capable PXCs then exchange messages with
   each other through IGP multicast-capable routing protocol to
   construct a distribution tree connecting all the edge routers.

7.3.2 Receiver Initiated

   Alternatively the signalling can start at the receiver side [20].
   The signalling starting at a receiver is sent in the direction of
   the root along an explicit path. In this case, the (wavelength)
   label distribution mode is a downstream-on-demand distribution and
   the LSP control is ordered. However, the signalling goes in the

                 Internet Draft û Expires August 2001               14

                  draft-poj-optical-multicast-00.txt     February 2001


   upstream direction from the destination node (receiver) to the
   source node (sender).

   The Downstream on Demand procedures applies to multicast
   distribution trees. Independent LSP control is needed so that
   different downstream branches of a multicast distribution tree can
   join the tree independently.

7.3.4 Additional Considerations

   After calculating the multicast tree, the offline tool can decide to
   already assign the wavelength for every link on every branch.
   Alternatively, it can leave it up to the individual PXCs and send
   the explicit multicast route to the source node and setup the
   corresponding light-tree through GMPLS signalling.

   In packet networks unicast and multicast have their own separate
   label spaces, this is no longer true for optical networks since
   wavelengths are physical, non-shareable and non-mergeable entities.
   If the PXCs perform the label allocation it would be advisable to
   define an allocation mechanism (downstream, downstream-on-demand,
   etc.) that is similar to the one used for unicast traffic. This in
   order to avoid simultaneous allocation of the same wavelength by the
   upstream and the downstream PXC.

7.4 User-plane Signalling

   Up to now, we donÆt address one of the key issues with optical
   multicast: the merging of user signalling-plane with the optical
   signalling-plane when considering a unified service model between
   the edge router and the optical domain.

   By applying one of the approaches defined in the previous, we obtain
   a transport-plane optical light-tree (which is by definition
   unidirectional) from the source S to the destination. So that a
   single source router can be reach simultaneously several destination
   belonging to the same multicast group. However, this document does
   not describe a mechanism in order to enable the destination to reach
   the source at the packet LSP level (i.e. at the user-plane level)
   since these considerations are out of the scope of this document.

   If the same administrative authority manages both the edge routers
   and the optical network, then a peer relationship between the PIM
   instance of the optical network and the client network can be
   defined.

   Otherwise, if the edge routers and the optical network belong to
   distinct administrative authorities, then a mapping between PIM
   instances need to be defined (see Figure).
