Abstract
   
   This memo defines and extension to the SIEVE mail filtering language
   (RFC 3028) for accessing IMAP mailbox and server annotations.

1.   Introduction
   
   This memo defines and extension to the SIEVE mail filtering language
   (RFC 3028) for accessing IMAP mailbox and server annotations.
   This allows to customize Sieve engine behaviour based on mailbox
   annotations.
   

2.   Conventions Used in this Document
   
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
   
   Conventions for notations are as in [SIEVE] section 1.1.

3.  mailbox and mboxmetadata Sieve extensions

3.1.  Test mailbox_exists

      Usage:   mailbox_exists <mailbox-names: string-list>

   The "mailbox_exists" test is true if the mailbox listed in the
   mailbox-names argument exist in the mailstore.
   <<Add some text saying that this making sense only if used with
   an IMAP mailstore or similar.>>
   Note that this test MUST return false for a mailbox which exists
   but is not accessible (for example due to access control
   restrictions) to the user in whose context the Sieve script runs.

   The capability string for use with the require command is "mailbox"
   or "mboxmetadata".

   Example: The following example assumes that the Sieve engine
    also supports "reject" [REJECT] and "fileinto" [SIEVE]. However
    these extensions are not required in order to implement the
    "mailbox".

             require ["fileinto", "reject", "mailbox"];
             if mailbox_exists "Partners" {
                fileinto "Partners";
             } else {
                reject "This message was not accepted by the Mailstore";
             }


3.2  Test metadata

      Usage:   metadata [MATCH-TYPE] [COMPARATOR]
               [":shared" / ":private"] <mailbox: string>
               <annotation-name: string> <key-list: string-list>

   This test retrieves the "value.priv" or "value.shared" of the mailbox
   annotation "annotation-name" for the mailbox "mailbox"
   [MBOX-ANNOTATIONS]. The retrieved value is compared to the
   "key-list". The test returns true <<if the annotation exists and>>
   its value matches any of the keys.

   The default annotation type is ":private". The default match type is
   ":is". The default comparator is "i;ascii-casemap".

   The capability string for use with the require command is
   "mboxmetadata".

   Example: The following example assumes that the Sieve engine
    also supports "variables" [Variables] and "notify" [NOTIFY] and
    "envelope" [SIEVE] extensions. However these extensions are not
    required in order to implement the "mboxmetadata".    
    
        require ["notify", "mboxmetadata", "variables", "envelope"];

        if metadata :matches :private "INBOX"
           "/vendor/isode/notification-uri" "*" {
            set "notif_uri" "${0}";
        }

        if not string :is "${notif_uri}" "none" {
            # :matches is used to get the MAIL FROM address
            if envelope :all :matches "from" "*" {
                set "env_from" " [really: ${1}]";
            }

            # :matches is used to get the value of the Subject header
            if header :matches "Subject" "*" {
                set "subject" "${1}";
            }

            # :matches is used to get the address from the From header
            if address :matches :all "from" "*" {
                set "from_addr" "${1}";
            }

            notify :method "${notif_uri}"
                   :message "${from_addr}${env_from}: ${subject}";
        }

4.   Security Considerations

   <<TBD>>

   
5.   IANA Considerations
   
   IANA is requested to add the following registrations to the list of
   Sieve extensions:

   Capability name: "mailbox"
   Description:     adds tests for checking for mailbox existence.
   RFC number:      this RFC
   Contact address: The Sieve discussion list <ietf-mta-filters@imc.org>
   
   Capability name: "mboxmetadata"
   Description:     adds tests for checking for mailbox existence,
                    checking for mailbox metadata item existence
                    and for retriving of a mailbox metadata value.
   RFC number:      this RFC
   Contact address: The Sieve discussion list <ietf-mta-filters@imc.org>
