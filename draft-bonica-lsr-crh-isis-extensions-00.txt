1.  Introduction

   Source nodes can use the IPv6 Compressed Routing Header (CRH)
   [I-D.bonica-6man-comp-rtg-hdr] to steer packets through a specified
   path.  This document defines IS-IS extensions that support the CRH.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Advertising The CRH Capability

   The Router CAPABILITY TLV [RFC7981] MAY contain exactly one CRH sub-
   TLV.  The CRH sub-TLV indicates that the advertising node can process
   the CRH.

   The CRH sub-TLV MAY contain sub-sub-TLVs.  No sub-sub-TLVs are
   currently defined.

                           Figure 1: CRH Sub-TLV

   Figure 1 depicts the CRH sub-TLV.  The CRH sub-TLV contains the
   following fields:

   o  Type: 8 bits.  CRH (value TBD by IANA)

   o  Length: 8 bits.  Length of TLV data excluding the TLV header.
      MUST be equal to 2 plus the length of sub-sub-TLVs (if any).

   o  Max CRH Len: 8 bits.  Maximum CRH length supported by the
      advertising node, measured in 8-octet units, not including the
      first 8 octets.  See Note 1.

   o  Reserved: 8 bits.  SHOULD be set to zero by sender.  MUST be
      ignored by receiver.

   Note 1: According to [RFC8200], all IPv6 Routings header include a
   "Hdr Ext Len" field.  That field specifies the length of the Routing
   header in 8-octet units, not including the first 8 octets.  The same
   unit of measure was chosen for the "Max CRH Len" field in the CRH
   sub-TLV.

4.  Advertising Supported Algorithms

   CRH-capable nodes use the SR Algorithm TLV
   [I-D.ietf-isis-segment-routing-extensions] to specify the algorithms
   that they support.

5.  Advertising Loosely Routed Segment Identifiers

   The following TLVs MAY contain one or more Loosely Routed SID sub-
   TLVs:

   o  TLV-236 (IPv6 IP Reachability) [RFC5308].

   o  TLV-237 (Multitopology IPv6 IP Reachability) [RFC5120].

   The Loosely Routed SID sub-TLV is valid only when its parent TLV
   specifies a prefix length of 128.  In this case, it binds the SID
   that it contains to the prefix (i.e., IPv6 address) that its parent

   TLV contains.  This information is used to construct the mapping
   table described in [I-D.bonica-6man-comp-rtg-hdr].

   When the parent TLV is propagated across level boundaries, the
   Loosely Routed SID sub-TLV SHOULD be kept.

   Figure 2 depicts the Loosely Routed SID sub-TLV.  It contains the
   following fields:

   o  Type: 8 bits.  Loosely Routed SID sub-TLV (Value TBD by IANA)

   o  Length: 8 bits.  Length of TLV data excluding the TLV header,
      measured in bytes.

   o  Reserved: SHOULD be set to zero by the sender.  MUST be ignored by
      the receiver.

   o  Algorithm : 8 bits.  The router may use various algorithms when
      calculating reachability to other nodes.  Algorithms identifiers
      are defined in Section 3.2 of
      [I-D.ietf-isis-segment-routing-extensions].

   o  SID - Variable length.  Segment Identifier.

6.  Advertising Strictly Routed Segment Identifiers

   The following TLVs can contain one or more Strictly Routed SID sub-
   TLVs:

   o  TLV-22 (Extended IS reachability) [RFC5305]

   o  TLV-222 (Multitopology IS) [RFC5120]

   o  TLV-23 (IS Neighbor Attribute) [RFC5311]

   o  TLV-223 (Multitopology IS Neighbor Attribute) [RFC5311]

   o  TLV-141 (inter-AS reachability information) [RFC5316]

   The Strictly Routed SID sub-TLV is valid only when its parent TLV
   also contains an IPv6 Neighbor Address sub-TLVs [RFC6119].  In this
   case, the SID contained by the Strictly Routed SID sub-TLV is bound
   to the IPv6 address contained by the IPv6 Neighbor Address sub-TLV.
   This information is used to construct the mapping table described in
   [I-D.bonica-6man-comp-rtg-hdr].

   Figure 3 depicts the Strictly Routed SID sub-TLV.  It contains the
   following fields:

   o  Length: 8 bits.  Length of TLV data excluding the TLV header,
      measured in bytes.

   o  Flags: 8 bits.  See below.

   o  Weight: 8 bits.  The value represents the SID weight for the
      purpose of load balancing.  The use of the weight is defined in
      [RFC8402].

   o  SID - Variable length.  Segment Identifier.

                Figure 4: Strictly Routed SID Sub-TLV Flags

   Figure 4 depicts Strictly Routed SID Sub-TLV flags.  They include the
   following:

   o  B-Flag: Backup flag.  If set, the SID is eligible for protection
      as described in [RFC8402].

   o  S-Flag:. Set flag.  When set, the S-Flag indicates that the SID
      refers to a set of adjacencies (and therefore MAY be assigned to
      other adjacencies as well).

   o  P-Flag: Persistent flag.  When set, the P-Flag indicates that the
      SID is persistently allocated, i.e., the SID value remains
      consistent across router restart and/or interface flap.)

7.  Advertising Strictly Routed Segment Identifiers Into LANs

   In LAN subnetworks, the Designated Intermediate System (DIS) is
   elected and originates the Pseudonode-LSP (PN-LSP) including all
   neighbors of the DIS.

   When the CRH is used, each router in the LAN MAY advertise its
   Strictly Routed SIDs of each of its neighbors.  Since, on LANs, each
   router only advertises one adjacency to the DIS (and doesn't
   advertise any other adjacency), each router advertises the set of
   Strictly routed SIDs (for each of its neighbors) inside a newly
   defined sub-TLV part of the TLV advertising the adjacency to the DIS
   (e.g.: TLV-22).

   The following TLVs can contain one or more LAN Strictly Routed SID
   sub-TLVs:

   o  TLV-22 (Extended IS reachability) [RFC5305]

   o  TLV-222 (Multitopology IS) [RFC5120]

   o  TLV-23 (IS Neighbor Attribute) [RFC5311]

   o  TLV-223 (Multitopology IS Neighbor Attribute) [RFC5311]

   The LAN Strictly Routed SID sub-TLV binds an IPv6 address to a SID.
   The sub-TLV contains both the IPv6 address and the SID.  This
   information is used to construct the mapping table described in
   [I-D.bonica-6man-comp-rtg-hdr].
