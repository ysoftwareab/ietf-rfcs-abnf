Abstract

   This document lists the design principles, scope, and requirements
   for the Electronic Commerce Modeling Language (ECML) version 2
   specification. It includes requirements as they relate to the html
   and XML syntax, data model, format, payment processing, and external
   requirements.

INTERNET DRAFT         ECML version 2 Requirements        November 2000


1. Introduction

   ECML Version 2.0 will describe the syntax of a class of data objects
   called Payment Processing Objects. This will involve the development
   of html tags and an XML syntax for payment transactions for both
   electronic wallets and Business to Business [B2B] payment types such
   as credit card, check, line of credit, ACH (Automated Clearing
   House,) Mobile Phone Payments and PDA Payments.

   This document lists the design principles, scope, and requirements
   over three things: (1) the scope of work available to the WG, (2) the
   ECML version 2 specification, and (3) applications that implement the
   specification. It includes requirements as they relate to the
   payment element syntax, data model, format, implementation, and
   external requirements and coordination. Those things that are
   required are designated as "must", those things that are optional are
   designated by "may", those things that are optional but recommended
   are designated as "should".

1.1 The ECML Alliance

   The set of fields documented herein was started by the ECML
   Alliance (www.ecml.org.)

1.2 Relationship to Other Standards

   The ECML fields were initially derived from and are consistent with
   the W3C P3P base data schema at

        <http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-P3P/basedata.html>.

   ECML Version 2.0 is not a replacement or alternative to SSL/TLS [RFC
   2246], SET [SET], XML [XML], or IOTP [IOTP]. These are important
   standards that provide functionality such as non-repudiatable
   transactions, automatable payment scheme selection, and smart card
   support.

   ECML may be used with any payment mechanism.  Information of the
   use of the ECML fields with W3C P3P protocol is available at
   <http://www.w3.org/TR/P3P-for-ecommerce>.

INTERNET DRAFT         ECML version 2 Requirements        November 2000

2. Design Principles and Scope

   1. The specification must describe the fields necessary to process an
      html or XML payment, and describe the html or XML content in
      particular. The html tags or XML syntax used to represent a
      payment (using any payment method) is described as ECML version 2.

   2. Keep the addition of fields from the previous specification [ECML
      v1.1] to a minimum.
 
   3. Maintain all existing functionality from ECML v1.1.

   4. Increase the flexibility of the standard to include other forms of
      payments.  These are:  ACH, Mobile Phone, PDA, Line of Credit,
      Purchasing Card and eCheck.

   5. Allow for use of the common and uniform DTD with back-end payment
      systems such as Enterprise Resource Provision [ERP,] Card Line
      Item Detail [LID] Level II & Level III, etc.

   6. Allow for use of the standard with B2B payment vehicles, such as
      B2B Wallets, Marketplaces, etc.

   7. Fully test the specification to insure that it is well-formed XML.

   8. Create an implementation guide to cover additional use cases for
      functionality included in this document.

   9. Consider for inclusion initial fields listed in "Using P3P for E-
      Commerce," a W3C note dtd 29 Nov 1999.

   10.ECML version 2 should be developed as part of the broader Web
      design philosophy of decentralization, URIs, Web data, modularity
      /layering / extensibility, and assertions as statements about
      statements. [Berners-Lee, WebData] In this context, this standard
      should take advantage of existing provider (and infrastructure)
      primitives.

3. Requirements

3.1 Payment Processing Elements

   1. Cost
   2. Receipt
   3. Currency
   4. Card
   5. Payment
   6. Bank/Telco

3.2 Payment Processing Types

   1. All current Processing types for ECML 1.1
   2. ACH
   3. eCheck
   4. Line Of Credit (LOC)
   5. Mobile phone payments
   6. PDA payments

3.3 XML Data Model and Syntax

   1. A well-formed DTD needs to be developed to include new fields in
      this standard.

   2. W3C Schema note may be drafted to document changes to the schema.

3.4 Implementation

   1. The ECML version 2 specification should meet the requirements of
      the following applications:
         1. Internet Open Trading Protocol v1.0 [IOTP]
         2. Financial Services Mark Up Language v2.0.
         3. At least one forms application [XFA, XFDL]
   2. Check against representative LOC, ACH, eCheck, Mobile Phone and
      PDA processes.
   3. Compare against (in accordance with standard's goals:)
	  1. Biztalk
          2. cXML
	  3. EBXML
          4. ISO 8583

4. Security Considerations

   ECML is dependent upon the security of the infrastructure of
   transmission providers that use the standard format.  ECML does not
   add any security to this infrastructure.
