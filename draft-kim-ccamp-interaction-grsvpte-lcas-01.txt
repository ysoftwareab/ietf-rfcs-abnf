Abstract 
                   
   This document describes interaction aspects between a signaling 
   protocol and the LCAS. The signaling protocol handled by IETF could 
   be GMPLS RSVP-TE. GMPLS CR-LDP requires further study for this draft. 
   The LCAS protocol handled by ITU-T is a protocol that is used to 
   change the bandwidth capacity of a virtual concatenated signal used 
   by transport networks (i.e. SDH and OTN), which should be initiated

   only in a unidirection by EMS or NMS systems. However, the GMPLS 
   signaling protocol have a feature of being capable of controlling bi-
   directional connections on a LSP. In current, there is no interaction 
   between the signaling protocol and the LCAS. In this document, when a 
   signaling protocol such as the GMPLS RSVP-TE and the LCAS are used 
   together within a single node and a bi-directional connection is 
   required on the same route, relevant requirements and encoding 
   methods are identified.

   This work fits in the CCAMP WG. 
 
1.3.  Why Is It Targeted at This WG 
 
   This draft is targeted at the CCAMP WG because this draft specifies 
   interaction requirements for a signaling protocol of the control 
   plane in GMPLS. These requirements have no impact on the LCAS at all. 
   As such it is believed to fit within the charter because it deals 
   with an upgrade of the signaling protocol such as the GMPLS RSVP-TE.

   The CCAMP WG should consider this document as the LCAS is fit for 
   GMPLS and the WG handles GMPLS. In addition, the draft addresses 
   upgrades of a signaling protocol such as the GMPLS RSVP-TE to help 
   the initiation process of egress node by EMS or NMS systems.

4.  Introduction 
    
   As described in [G.7042], LCAS is a link capacity adjustment scheme 
   that should be used to increase or decrease the capacity of a 
   container that is transported in an SDH/OTN network using Virtual 
   Concatenation(VC). The operation of LCAS is unidirectional under 
   control of EMS or NMS systems. This means that in order to bi-
   directionally add or delete members the procedure has to be repeated 
   in the opposite direction. The scheme uses the K4 overhead byte for 
   lower order LCAS of VC-m-Xv (m=11,12,2) and the H4 overhead byte for 
 
 
Kim, et al                                                      [Page 3]

   higher order LCAS of VC-n-Xv (n=3,4) in SDH to exchange control 
   packets. In OTN, the scheme uses VC overhead (VCOH 1/2/3) in the 
   information structure, optical channel payload unit (OPUk, k = 1/2/3). 
   From the view-point of implementation, LCAS is a layer 1 based 
   protocol, differently from signaling protocols. 
    
   From the view-point of IETF, it is said that the LCAS-related path 
   computation performed by NMS could be performed within a network  
   element as well if routing functions are used to exchange the 
   information of network topology and link status. However, for 
   convenience' sake we assume that the path computation is performed in 
   NMS. 
    
   As an example using LCAS, we could take the following figure. NMS  
   could initiate an increase or decrease command to indicate addition 
   or deletion of members to the ingress node(Node1) for the downstream 
   direction (links La/e/i) and to the egress node(Node4) for the 
   upstream direction (links Ll/h/d/b) over a LSP.

   We could assume a LSP with a bi-direction of the same route for 
   respective direction. The SONET/SDH based transport network is a 
   typical example. As described in [GMPLS-ARCH], GMPLS allows 
   connection control of bi-directional symmetric LSPs. However, in 
   current, GMPLS signaling protocols have no knowledge about the LCAS 
   application. As such, although GMPLS signaling protocols have the 
   capability of bi-directional connection, the ingress and egress nodes 
   have to initiate requests of the connection setup and release to the 
   respective direction. However, as indicated in [GMPLS-ARCH], these 
   two unidirectional paths have several disadvantages such as latency 
   delay, control overhead, complicated route selection, and so on.

   This document describes interaction aspects to resolve the 
   inconsistency between a signaling protocol and LCAS .The signaling 
   protocol handled by IETF could be GMPLS RSVP-TE. GMPLS CR-LDP 
   requires further study for this draft. When a signaling protocol such 
   as GMPLS RSVP-TE and LCAS are used together within a node and the bi-
   directional connection is requested over the same route, the relevant 
   requirements are identified to avoid the initiation process of egress 
   node by EMS or NMS systems. 
    
    
5. Review of GMPLS RSVP-TE, LMP and LCAS 
    
   To support the interaction capability between a signaling protocol 
   and LCAS, the GMPLS signaling protocol and link management protocol 
   should provide several functions such as connection control of bi-
   directional LSP, explicit routing, route recoding, component 
   indication of downstream and upstream interfaces, link property 
   correlation, link connectivity verification, and LCAS operation 
   indication. As indicated in [GMPLS-ARCH], most of these features have 
   been supported by the signaling protocol and link management protocol 
   except for the LCAS operation indication.  
    
   For examples, As indicated in [RFC3473], a bi-directional LSP setup 
   is indicated by the presence of an Upstream Label in the Path message. 
   Explicit routing about the path taken by an LSP is controlled by 
   using an Explicit Route Object (ERO) in the message. Up-to-date 
   detailed path information on a hop-by-hop basis during the LSP setup 
   process is collected via route recoding mechanism of using Record 
   Route Object (RRO) in [RFC3209]. Component indication of downstream 
   and upstream interfaces is resolved using the IF_ID RSVP_HOP object. 
   In addition, property correlation and connectivity verification about 
   component interfaces connected between a pair of nodes are supported 
   by [LMP]. 
 
   The link capacity adjustment scheme had been standardized in Nov. 
   2001 by ITU-T, and the scheme have included LCAS operations such as 
   addition, deletion, and temporary removal of one or more members that 
   they may have effects on the LSP control. But, we think the temporary 
   removal does not influence the LSP control. The GMPLS signaling 
   protocol still have no opportunity to add these LCAS-related 
   feature(s). Here, we could think the advantages that we could obtain 
   from the inclusion of the LCAS operation indication into the 
   signaling protocol. To address the advantages, we will use 
   information flows diagram that are based on the figure above. 
    
   The first situation is not to apply the indication of LCAS setup in 
   the signaling protocol on which requires a bi-directional LSP. The

   This figure above is the procedure that is performed after NMS's 
   requests with an Increase command of each direction. Of course, in 
   this diagram more detailed LCAS procedures and GMPLS RSVP-TE 
   procedures are omitted. In addition, Increase commands for the 
   respective downstream (ds) and upstream (us) could be issued at the 
   same time by NMS. The important thing is that the respective 
   direction should apply the own individual LSP procedure. Possible 
   disadvantages in this case are identified in [GMPLS-ARCH]. Another 
   important drawback is difficult to meet real-time protection 
   requirements. 
    
   Then, to avoid the problem we could consider the second situation to 
   use the indication of LCAS setup in the signaling protocol.

   This figure above is the procedure that is performed after NMS's 
   requests with an INCREASE command for bi-directional setup. Of course, 
   in this figure as well more detailed LCAS procedures and GMPLS RSVP-
   TE procedures are omitted. In addition, ADD control packets in the 
   ingress and egress nodes could be issued at a proper time that has 
   nothing to do with the opposite's condition. 
                   
 
6.  Interaction requirements 
    
   When using the second procedure with the LCAS operation indication, 
   we could have three considerations, the NMS's bi-directional request 
   for a LCAS operation, how to encode the LCAS operation indication, 
   and the unsuccessful response of an initiation request. 
    
6.1.  NMS's bi-directional request 
    
   For the first consideration, we may exchange opinions between ITU-T 
   and IETF in order to initiate a LCAS operation in a bi-direction at a 
   once only under the assumption that the bi-directional connection is 
   established over the same route and a pair of component interfaces 
   for downstream and downstream traffic. 
    
6.2.  LCAS operation indication 
    
   For the second consideration, the Path message has to include the 
   indication of requesting the initiation of LCAS operation to the 
   opposite direction by an egress node. The LCAS operation indication 
   has no impact on transit nodes and has to be transparently delivered 
   to an egress node. If the current specification of GMPLS RSVP-TE 
   would have included relevant object(s) to add the indication, we 
   could resolve the problem statement easily. And, if we wouldn't find 
   out relevant object(s) in the current documents, we could define a 
   new object with the LCAS operation indication. 
    
   For the case to use an object among the current objects, we could 
   consider the extension of ADMIN_STATUS object in [RFC3471]. As 
   indicated in the document, the information is currently used in two 
   ways, for the indication of administrative state with respect to a 
   particular LSP, and for the indication of a request to set an LSP's 
   administrative state. However, it looks like these uses don't fit to 
   the LCAS operation indication. As such, we could think the expansion 
   of its use to include the LCAS operation indication. 
    
   In addition, we could consider the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object. The 
   SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object can be added to aid in session 
   identification and diagnostics. Especially, using the flags field 
   with 8 bits of this object, options such as a local repair mechanism 
   of transit routers, the inclusion of label information, and the use

   of SE Style could be indicated. In current, three of those bits are 
   assigned in [RFC3209]. A further two bits are assigned in [FRR] for 
   fast re-reroute functionality. We could use the sixth bit of this 
   field to initiate the LCAS operation by an egress node. 
    
   In other alternative, it is to include the LCAS operation indication 
   to a new object for RSVP-TE messages. A good solution is to use the 
   mechanism addressed in [ATTRI]. 
    
6.3.  Response of an initiation request  
    
   For the third consideration, we have to consider the response of an 
   initiation request of the LCAS operation. An egress node could accept 
   or reject the request of the LCAS operation such as addition or 
   deletion of one or members. In the case of rejection, there are two 
   possibilities implicit and explicit rejection. The implicit rejection 
   means that an egress node could not perform the LCAS operations 
   because the node does not run the LCAS protocol, and the explicit 
   rejection means that an egress node could not perform the LCAS 
   operations due to a resource problem or other causes although the 
   node do run the LCAS protocol. On the receipt of successful or 
   unsuccessful result about the initiation request of the LCAS 
   operation, the ingress node would take an appropriate action such as 
   an notification to its maintenance system or an actual start-up of 
   the LCAS operation towards the egress node. 
    
    
7. Proposal of the draft 
    
7.1.  NMS's bi-directional request 
    
   We think this requirement is not so actual a problem if there is an 
   internal agreement between control and management planes for the LCAS 
   operation to be initiated by the GMPLS RSVP-TE in an egress node not 
   by EMS or NMS systems. Also, there is no need to modify the LCAS 
   specification for the interaction between the LCAS and GMPLS RSVP-TE. 
   The important thing is that an original initiation for the LCAS 
   operation by a management system, and the unidirectional nature of 
   the LCAS operation is remain unchanged. In a sense, this requirement 
   looks like a implementation issue. 
    
7.2.  LCAS operation indication 
    
   Ahead of this contribution, we have already the mechanism in used to 
   process signaling attributes to be imposed on the path between an 
   ingress and egress nodes. If the mechanism gets an agreement from the 
   CCAMP WG, we propose to use the Attribute flags addressed in [ATTRI] 
   for the LCAS operation indication. More detailed encoding rules 
   should be clarified, based on the requirement described in the

   previous chapter. One consideration for the encoding rules of the 
   LCAS operation indication is that how many bits should be used to 
   identify the LCAS operations such as addition and deletion of members. 
   We think that only a single bit could identify a LCAS operation using 
   setup or release information of a LSP in which the setup information 
   mean the LCAS addition operation, and the release operation mean the 
   LCAS deletion operation. Then, it is appropriate for the LSP 
   attributes flag of [ATTRI] to include a bit with "LCAS operation". 
    
7.3.  Response of an initiation request 
    
   Although there is no need to indicate an accept of the LCAS operation 
   within a response to the Path message, in the case of failure, the 
   response should include one of rejection causes of the LCAS operation. 
   Possible error codes are such as the following, and other codes could 
   be added: 
    
   - "Unsupported LCAS protocol" : when an egress node do not support 
   the LCAS protocol. 
    
   - "Not performable LCAS operation" : when an egress node could not 
   perform the LCAS operation due to a resource contention or other 
   causes. 
    
Security Considerations 
    
   This document proposes enhancements of GMPLS RSVP-TE for an 
   interaction between the LCAS and the GMPLS RSVP-TE. It does not 
   introduce any new direct security issues and the reader is referred 
   to the security considerations expressed in [RFC2205], [RFC3209] and 
   [RFC3473].
