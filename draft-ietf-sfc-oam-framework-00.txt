1.  Introduction

   Service Function Chaining (SFC) enables the creation of composite
   services that consist of an ordered set of Service Functions (SF)
   that are be applied to packets and/or frames selected as a result of
   classification.  SFC is a concept that provides
   for more than just the application of an ordered set of SFs to
   selected traffic; rather, it describes a method for deploying SFs in
   a way that enables dynamic ordering and topological independence of
   those SFs as well as the exchange of metadata between participating
   entities.  The foundations of SFC are described in the following
   documents:

   o  SFC problem statement [I-D.ietf-sfc-problem-statement]

   o  SFC architecture [I-D.ietf-sfc-archiecture]

   The reader is assumed to familiar with the material in these drafts.

   This document provides reference framework for Operations,
   Administration and Maintenance (OAM, [RFC6291]) of SFC.
   Specifically, this document provides:

   o  In Section 2, an SFC layering model;

   o  In Section 3, aspects monitored by SFC OAM;

   o  In Section 4, functional requirements for SFC OAM;

   o  In Section 5, a gap analysis for SFC OAM.

1.1.  Document Scope

   The focus of this document is to provide an architectural framework
   for SFC OAM, particularly focused on the aspect of the Operations
   component within OAM.  Actual solutions and mechanisms are outside 
   the scope of this document.

2.  SFC Layering Model

   Multiple layers come into play for implementing the SFC.  These
   include the service layer at which SFC operates and the underlying
   Network, Transport, Link, etc., layers.

   o  The service layer, refered to as the "Service Layer" in Figure 1,
      consists of classifiers and SFs, and uses the

      transport network, which could be an overlay network, from a
      classifier to SF and from one SF to the next.

   o  The network overlay transport layer, refer to as the "Network",
      "Transport" and layers below in Figure 1, extends between the
      various SFs and is mostly transparent to the SFs themselves.  It
      can leverage various overlay network technologies
      interconnecting SFs and allows establishment of
      service function paths (SFPs).

   o  The link layer, refer to as the "Link" in Figure 1, is dependent
      upon the physical technology used.  Ethernet is a popular choice
      for this layer, but other alternatives are deployed (e.g. POS,
      DWDM, etc.).

3.  Aspects Monitored by SFC OAM?

   SFC operates at the service layer.  For the purpose of defining
   the OAM framework, the following aspects of the SFC must be capable of
   monitored.

   1. Service function:

   SFs may be SFC-aware or SFC-unaware.  An SFC-aware SF is one that
   understands the SFC encapsulation has the SFF component co-resident with
   the SF sub-component .  An SFC-unware SF is one that does not understand
   the SFC encapsulation (i.e. a legacy SF) and has to be accessed via an
   separate SFF and potentially an SFC proxy function.

   In both cases, an SF is accessed through an SFF in the SFC
   architecture.  SFC OAM must be able to monitor the SFF associated
   with a given SF.

   2.  Service function path: 

   The SFP comprises a set of SFs that may be ordered or unordered. 
   SFC OAM must be capable of monitoring the SFP and the rendered 
   service path (RSP) that may be used by specific packets.

   3.  Classifier: 

   The classifier determines which packets are mapped to an SFP.  
   SFC OAM must be able to monitor the operation of the classifiers.

   The figure below illustrates the various aspects monitored by SFC OAM.

3.1.  Operation and Performance of SFs

3.1.1.  Monitoring SF Operation

   One SFC OAM requirement for the SF component is to
   allow an SFC aware network device to monitor a
   specific SF.  This is accomplished by monitoring the SFF that 
   the SF is attached to.

   A generalized way to monitor the operation of an SF is beyond the scope
   of SFC OAM, because the functions provided by the SF are not covered by
   SFC. SFs typically provide their own tools for monitoring.

   An optional capability may be provided for an SFF to monitor the
   operation of its attached SFs and report that on behalf of the SFs.

3.1.2.  Service Function Performance Measurement

   A second SFC OAM requirement for SF is to
   allow an SFC aware network device to check the loss and delay to a
   specific SF, located on the same or different network
   devices.

3.2.  Operation and Performance of SFPs

Internet-Draft              SFC OAM Framework                August 2015


3.2.1.  Monitoring SFP Operation

   SFC OAM must be capable of monitoring one or more SFPs or RSPs that are
   used to realize the SFC and reporting on connectivity and providing fault
   isolation.

   In order to perform service connectivity verification of an SFP, the
   OAM tools could be initiated from any SFC-aware network device for
   end-to-end paths, or partial paths terminating on a specific SF, within 
   the SFP.  This OAM function is to ensure the SF's chained together has
   connectivity as it was intended to when SFP was established.
   Necessary return code(s) should be defined to be sent back in the
   response to OAM packet, in order to qualify the verification.

   When ECMP exists at the service layer on a given SFC (e.g. multiple
   SFPs, or multiple RSPs), there must be an ability to discover and 
   traverse all available paths.

3.2.2.  Service Function Chain Performance Measurement

   The ingress of the SFC or an SFC-aware network
   device must have an ability to perform loss and delay measurements
   over the SFC as a unit (i.e. end-to-end) or to a
   specific SF through the SFC.

3.3.  Monitoring the Classifier

   A classifier defines a flow and maps incoming traffic to a specific
   SFC, and it is vital that the classifier is correctly defined and
   functioning. SFC OAM must be able to test the definition of
   flows and the mapping functionality to expected SFCs.

4.  SFC OAM Functions

   Section 3 described the various aspects monitored by SFC OAM.  This
   section explores the same from the OAM functionality
   point of view, which many will be applicable to multiple SFC
   components.

   Various SFC OAM requirements provides the need for various OAM
   functions at different layers.  Many of the OAM functions at
   different layers are already defined and in existence.  In order to
   support SFC and SF's, these functions have to be enhanced to operate
   a single SF to multiple SF's in an SFC and also multiple SFC's.

4.1.  Connectivity Functions

   Connectivity is mainly an on-demand function to verify that the
   connectivity exists between network elements and that the SFs are
   operational.  Ping is a common tool used to perform
   this function.  OAM messages should be encapsulated with necessary
   SFC header and with OAM markings when testing the SFC component.  OAM
   messages MAY be encapsulated with necessary SFC

Aldrin, et al.           Expires February 2016                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft              SFC OAM Framework                August 2015


   header and with OAM markings when testing the SF
   component.  Some of the OAM functions performed by connectivity
   functions are as follows:

   o  Verify the MTU size from a source to the destination SF or through
      the SFC.  This requires the ability for OAM packet to take
      variable length packet size.

   o  Verify the packet re-ordering and corruption.

   o  Verify the policy of an SFC or SF using OAM packet.

   o  Verification and validating forwarding paths.

   o  Proactively test alternate or protected paths to ensure
      reliability of network configurations.

4.2.  Continuity Functions

   Continuity is a model where OAM messages are sent periodically to
   validate or verify the reachability to a given SF or through a given
   SFC.  This allows the operator to monitor the network device and to
   quickly detect failures such as link failures, network failures, 
   SF outages or SFC outages.  BFD is one such function which helps
   in detecting failures quickly.  OAM functions supported by continuity
   check are as follows:

   o  Ability to provision continuity check to a given SF or through a
      given SFC.

   o  Notifying the failure upon failure detection for other OAM
      functions to take appropriate action.

4.3.  Trace Functions

   Tracing is an important OAM function that allows the operation to
   trigger an action (ex: response generation) from every transit device
   on the tested layer.  This function is typically useful to gather
   information from every transit devices or to isolate the failure
   point towards an SF or through an SFC.  Mechanisms must be provided so
   that the SFC OAM messages may be sent along the same path that a
   given data packet would follow.  Some of the OAM functions supported
   by trace functions are:

   o  Ability to trigger action from every transit device on the tested
      layer towards an SF or through an SFC, using TTL or other means.

   o  Ability to trigger every transit device to generate response with
      OAM code(s) on the tested layer towards an SF or through an SFC,
      using TTL or other means.

   o  Ability to discover and traverse ECMP paths within an SFC.

Internet-Draft              SFC OAM Framework                August 2015


   o  Ability to skip un-supported SF's while tracing SF's in an SFC.

4.4.  Performance Measurement Function

   Performance management functions involve measuring of packet loss,
   delay, delay variance, etc.  These measurements could be measured
   pro-actively and on-demand.

   SFC OAM should provide the ability to test the packet loss
   for an SFC.  In an SFC, there are various SF's chained together.

   Measuring packet loss is very important function.  Using on-demand
   function, the packet loss could be measured using statistical means.
   Using OAM packets, the approximation of packet loss for a given SFC
   could be measured.

   Delay within an SFC could be measured from the time it takes for a
   packet to traverse the SFC from ingress SF to egress SF.  As the
   SFC's are generally unidirectional in nature, measurement of one-way
   delay is important.  In order to measure one-way delay, the clocks
   have to be synchronized using NTP, GPS, etc.

   Delay variance could also be measured by sending OAM packets and
   measuring the jitter between the packets passing through the SFC.

   Some of the OAM functions supported by the performance measurement
   functions are:

   o  Ability to measure the packet processing delay of a service
      function or a service function path along an SFC.

   o  Ability to measure the packet loss of a service function or a
      service function path along an SFC.

5.  Gap Analysis

   This Section identifies various OAM functions available at different
   levels.  It will also identify various gaps
   within the existing toolset, to perform OAM function on an SFC.


5.1.  Existing OAM Functions

   There are various OAM tool sets available to perform OAM function and
   network layer, protocol layers and link layers.  These OAM functions
   could validate some of the network overlay transport.  Tools like
   ping and trace are in existence to perform connectivity check and
   tracing intermediate hops in a network.  These tools support
   different network types like IP, MPLS, TRILL etc.  There is also an
   effort to extend the tool set to provide connectivity and continuity
   checks within overlay networks.  BFD is another tool which helps in
   detection of data forwarding failures.

   +----------------+--------------+-------------+--------+------------+
   | SFC            | None         + None        + None   + None       |
   +----------------+--------------+-------------+--------+------------+

5.2.  Missing OAM Functions

   As shown in Table 1, OAM functions for SFC are not yet standardized.
   Hence, there are no standards-based tools available to monitor the
   various components identified in Section 3.

5.3.  Required OAM Functions

   Primary OAM functions exist for network, transport, link and other
   layers.  Tools like ping, trace, BFD, etc., exist in order to perform
   these OAM functions.  Configuration, orchestration and manageability
   of SF and SFC could be performed using CLI, Netconf etc.

   For configuration, manageability and orchestration, providing data
   and information models for SFC is very much essential.  With
   virtualized SF and SFC, manageability of these functions has to be
   done programmatically.

   SFC OAM must provide tools that operate through various types of
   SFs including:

   o  Transparent SFs: These SFs typically do not make any
      modifications to the packet.  In such cases, the SFF may be able
      to process OAM messages.

   o  SFs that modify the packet: These SFs modify packet
      fields.  Certain SFs may modify only the headers
      corresponding to the network over which it is transported, e.g.
      the MAC headers or overlay headers.  In other cases, the IP header
      of the application's packet may be modified, e.g.  NAT.  In yet
      other cases, the application session itself may be terminated and
      a new session initiated, e.g. a load balancer that offers HTTPS
      termination.

6.  Open Issues

   - Add more details on performance measurement.

   - Call out which OAM functions can be achieved by protocol design vs
     requiring synthetic traffic.

7.  Security Considerations

   SFC OAM must provide mechanisms for:

   o  Preventing usage of OAM channel for DDOS attacks.

   o  Preventing leakage of OAM packets meant for a given SFC beyond
      that SFC.

   o  Preventing leakage of information about an sFC beyond its
      administrative domain.
