1. Introduction

   DSN [1],the abbreviation of Distributed Services Network, is a new
   question being standardized in ITU-T proposed by China Mobile. [3]
   outlines the DSN Architecture. As described in [3], DSN can support
   many applications, such as Multimedia telephony services, streaming
   services, content distribution services and so on.

   DSN VoIP system is designed based on the theory of DSN and P2PSIP.
   According to [1], DSN VoIP system includes two layers over IP network:
   P2PSIP layer and the application layer. The application layer uses
   SIP protocol for call and P2PSIP layer uses RELOAD[4] protocol for
   call routing in overlay network.

   It also analyzes some key problems in P2P VoIP system and defines the
   corresponding requirements in this document. It also includes the
   system architecture, components and key technologies. At last it
   presents some measurement work for validating the DSN VoIP system.

2. Requirements and key problems of carrier-grade P2P VoIP system

2.1. Requirements

   Peer-to-Peer(P2P) systems have been widely deployed in current
   internet, due to its advantages such as high scalability and cost-
   effectiveness. Many P2P technologies have been to implement the
   traditional telecom voice service (for example, IMS or softswitch)
   such as Skype. But it hasn't been discussed thoroughly that how to
   make P2P system meet the telecom infrastructure performance
   requirements, which is usually called as the "Carrier-Grade"
   requirements. According to the current performance of telecom voice
   service deployments, the requirements of the carrier-grade services
   can be summarized but not limited to those listed below:

   1. Qos guarantee: Current IMS requires that any client-side
      operations should be able to get the final responses in 300
      milliseconds. Therefore, P2P VoIP system should be able to
      guarantee the signaling response time which is comparable to this
      time and the media transmission time which is less than 400ms.
      There are also some specifications for voice quality, which is not
      mentioned in this document.

   2. High Availability: The high availability includes network
      availability, service availability, and subscriber data
      availability and so on. The most common practice is to use some
      special mechanisms to acquire robustness and availability such as
      hot backup redundancy. High availability is a severe challenge for
      P2P VoIP systems which intends to achieve the same level of the
      telecom systems.

   3. Scalability: The P2P VoIP system should be adapted to the
      expanding of the system scale, such as the increasing of the
      number of the clients or core nodes.

   4. Load balance: The resource is distributed among P2P nodes and each
      node should be able to collaborate with one another to avoid the
      emergence of the centralization of resource and traffic.

   5. Cost-effectiveness: It's the aim that the P2P VoIP system can
      achieve the same performance as the telecom commercial system by
      fully utilizing only commodity PCs, not using the costly hardware.

   6. Maintainability: it's quite appealing that it needs to do a little
      work to configure the nodes and network in order to maintain the
      natural operation of the P2P VoIP system. P2P VoIP system can
      realize the self-organization even after any network failure, so
      as to reduce the demand for emergent response and well experienced
      operators.

   7. Others: TBD.

2.2. Some Key problems

   To obtain the same performance as the telecom system, there are many
   key problems needed to be solved. Some of them are listed as below:

   1. Routing performance: The traditional P2P routing performance is
      relative to the network dimensions. The routing performance will
      be sharply descended as the increase of the network dimensions,
      for example, the traditional Chord routing performance is O(logN).

   2. Redundant traffic: The P2P network does not match the underlying
      network, so the P2P nodes forward the traffic only according to
      the logic P2P routing and not to the real optimal IP layer network
      routing, and this will cause mass P2P redundant traffic
      iteratively across many Automatic Systems(AS).

Internet-Draft               p2psip bcp                 March 11, 2011


   3. The reliability and availability of subscriber data: Current P2P
      network can't provide an efficient solution for the reliability
      and availability of subscriber data in case of the random joining
      or exiting of the P2P nodes happened in the network.

   4. Duplicate data consistency: There are many replicas for subscriber
      data to acquire enough availability. It's very common that the
      subscribers' data are often modified, so the system must allow for
      the updating and amendment information to be propagated to all
      replicas asynchronously.

   5. Hot spot: The subscriber data are distributed unevenly in the
      network, which will cause that some nodes have much more
      subscribers' data than the others. Therefore, it might probably
      lead to more traffic due to those high-loaded nodes which might
      makes these nodes overload and even fault in some cases.

   6. Single node failure: If a node fails, its clients can't use the
      services.

   7. Others: TBD.

   It discusses some key technologies in section 3.3 with a view to
   solve the above questions.

3. DSN VoIP System Overview

   DSN VoIP system is a VoIP system based on P2P overlay. DSN VoIP
   system uses SIP protocol for call transaction and RELOAD for call
   routing.

3.1. System Architecture

   According to the architecture of RELOAD, DSN VoIP system has the
   similar architecture and contains some essential components defined
   in RELOAD, such as Usage Layer, Routing Layer, Storage and so on. The
   architecture of DSN VoIP system is shown as figure 1.

   There are two basic modules in P2PSIP layer: KBR and Data Storage
   module.

   The key based routing, KBR, refers to find the best suitable host for
   an input key, also includes ID management, DHT routing protocol,
   topology maintenance, peers failure detecting and etc. DSN VoIP
   system implements a unique KBR routing scheme with real-time response
   and a traffic localization mechanism, including a novel ID assignment
   method.

   The data storage module takes charge of management of subscriber data,
   including storage, restoring, consistency verification and etc. Here
   DSN VoIP system implements a unique and practical replica replacement
   strategy and an effective consistency strategy.

3.2. System Implementation and Components

   DSN VoIP system includes some distributed servers and subscriber
   terminals. These servers form the DSN VoIP network by using P2P
   protocol and share load for each other. According to the different
   functions, the server can be Peer Node(PN), Application Server(AS),
   Enrollment Server(ES), Edge Agent(EA), Super Peer-Maintenance
   (SPM),Relay Node(RN) and RN Cluster Server(RCS). According to the
   support for P2P protocol, the subscriber terminal can be the
   traditional SIP Client(SiC) and Peer Client(PeC). The DSN VoIP system
   framework is shown as figure 2.

          Figure 2 The framework and components of DSN VoIP system

   Peer Node(PN): PN is the core node in DSN VoIP network and is
   deployed by telecom operators. PN is responsible for DHT topology
   maintenance, overlay routing, storage and access for
   subscriber/service data, subscriber registration and Authentication,
   BootStrap, SIP session control and VoIP service.

   Application Server(AS): AS can provide other services which can't be
   provided by Peer Node(PN).

   Enrollment Server(ES): ES implements BootStrap service when the PeC
   or PN joins the DSN VoIP network for the first time. When new PN
   joins, ES is responsible for authentication for the new node. ES is
   deployed by telecom operators and fixed in the network.

   Edge Agent(EA):EA provides the relay service for SiC and adapt to all
   kinds of services and connections to PN. EA supports SIP proxy
   discovery for DSN and connection with PN.

   SPM(Super Peer Maintenance): SPM is an administrator for one zone.
   SPM undertakes the registration of the PN nodes in the same zone,
   assigns the nodes IDs to PN nodes and maintain DHT routing
   information.

Internet-Draft               p2psip bcp                 March 11, 2011


   Relay Node(RN): RN is responsible for NAT traversal and media traffic
   forwarding. RN can discover the DSN and connection with PN. RN can be
   deployed by telecom operators or upgraded from PeC.

   RN Cluster Server(RCS): RCS is responsible for the management of RN
   nodes according to topology information or RTT(Round-Trip Time). RCS
   manages one AS and assigns a suitable RN for PeC according to the
   information about PeC's request or location etc.

   SIP Client(SiC): SiC support only SIP protocol and can't discover the
   DSN network if it is directly connected to the DSN. It must connect
   directly with Edge Agent (EA).

   Peer Client(PeC): PeC support both SIP protocol and P2P protocol. PeC
   can be upgraded to be Relay Node (RN) or RN Cluster, but can't be
   Peer Node(PN).

   PN nodes form the DSN VoIP network and interconnect via P2P protocol.
   The subscriber terminal can get valid service once it connects to any
   PN. If some but not all PN nodes fail or go offline, this will not
   affect the normal operation of DSN network. We can add more new PN
   nodes to augment the capacity of DSN network.

3.3. System Key technologies

   In this section, it presents with some key technologies which is
   aiming to solve the problem in sec 2.2.

   1.   SPM assisted one hop route: DSN VoIP system is typically
      deployed as a two-layer DHT, including a global DHT (corresponding
      to countrywide) and several regional DHTs (corresponding to
      provinces). For each region, there are several special peers
      dedicated to routing information updating and some other
      management tasks and these special peers are SPM. Multiple SPMs
      can be deployed in a large region. Each one is responsible for a
      partition of PN belonging to that region, and these SPMs backup
      each other. SPMs from different regions are full-mesh connected,
      they run a gossip-based protocol to maintain a strongly consistent
      view of their existence. All PN nodes must register to the local
      SPM of the same region, when they join the network. During runtime,
      once the PN's state change is detected by its neighboring PN, the
      neighbor will notify the local SPM, and then the SPM will
      disseminate the event to other SPMs, finally each SPM will
      broadcast this notification to all PN nodes under the charge of it.
      In this way, each PN can obtain other PNs' information through SPM
      and can maintain routing table for all PNs. So SPM assisted one
      hop route can be implemented.

   2.   Traffic Localization: Recent studies showed that a large volume
      of inter-domain redundant traffic aroused by P2P mismatch problem
      already became a serious problem. As mentioned above, each PN node
      joins the countrywide global DHT and one regional DHT at the same
      time. We use a novel peer ID assignment scheme optimized for
      global load balancing, which can write the regional information
      into peer ID. With this unique ID scheme, the global DHT and
      regional DHT can be maintained by only one KBR (Key Based Routing)
      incarnation, that's different with many other layered DHT proposed.
      Every object will be put in the regional DHT and global DHT for
      disaster recovery, according to the normal DHT semantics
      internally.

   3.   Replica Placement strategy: The DSN VoIP system raises a unique
      N:B replica placement which provides an effective way to backup
      and recovery subscribers' data from local and remote region. Under
      this solution a parallel recovery factor N is defined as how many
      candidates should be used as the recovery. And B is defined as the
      number of Backups which means how many duplicated replicas the
      overlay hold. Subscriber data in each primary peer node is divided
      into S=N/B slices. After that, each B backup peers in a group for
      this primary peer will backup the same slice of subscriber data.
      One peer node could execute data backup procedure to send data to
      different backup peers simultaneously. Compare to 1:1 backup
      mechanism, not only does our N:B replica placement increase the
      efficiency of parallel recovery, but also avoids the reservation
      of half capacities (CPU cycles, bandwidth) for potential migration
      of the service backed up.

   4.   Consistency Strategy: In order to ensure better data
      consistency, DSN VoIP system will trigger "DataCheck" and
      "DataGoHome" mechanisms periodically. DSN VoIP system through
      "DataCheck" triggers the comparison between the data version
      information of the corresponding PN nodes, and updates the
      inconsistent data to ensure that the eventual consistency of
      subscriber profiles. "DataGoHome" takes charge of identifying
      those temporary irregular data, recalculate their key-value pair
      and push them to correct PN nodes. With the help of timing service
      always available in telecom offices, DSN VoIP system uses
      timestamp in order to capture causality between different versions
      of the same data. One can determine whether two versions of a data
      have a causal ordering by examine their timestamps.

   5.   Strip Segmentation method Based ID Assignment: We use this
      method to generate the subscriber ID. This method can evenly
      distribute the subscriber data on each PN node so as to achieve
      traffic load balance and avoid hot spot. The detailed method can
      be referred to [5].

   6.   Single node failure handle: If a PN node fails, we design some
      mechanisms to ensure the natural operation of VoIP service. For
      the session in progress, the session between the caller and the
      callee is established, the standby PN checks the primary PN in
      failure, and the standby PN notifies the associated nodes and
      switch the session to itself. For the new call originated from the
      caller, if the standby PN has switch to be the primary PN and
      notified the subscribers, the call originated from the subscriber
      will be routed to the standby PN. For the new call originated from
      the callee, if the callee knows the failure in the primary PN by
      requesting routing or querying routing table, the callee will
      route the query to the standby PN and establishes the session.

   7.   Others: TBD.

4. Validation of DSN VoIP system in lab environment

4.1. Overview

   We did some measurements to validate the DSN VoIP system and its key
   technologies and all these were described in this document of version
   01 which was submitted in IETF 77 meeting. In this document, we don't
   repeat the results and conclusions in the first document.

   Here we do some more thorough measurements to validate the
   performance and reliability of DSN VoIP system which are carried out
   in a bigger network.

   We set up a DSN VoIP demo system in CMCC lab. The demo system
   includes 58 PN nodes, two SPM and one ES. All the PN nodes are
   deployed on VMWare machine and have the same configuration: two
   virtual CPU, 2G virtual memory, 75G hard disk space and SUSE Linux
   Enterprise Desktop 10 SP2 (i586). We deploy the four VM machines on
   one HP DL320 server and we use seventeen HP DL320 servers. All these
   HP servers connect through one Cisco 7500 layer3 switch.

   Our emphases are system bulk call performance measurement and
   reliability measurement under churn.

4.2. System bulk call performance measurement

   For measuring the bulk call performance of the demo system, we
   configure the following parameters:

   1.call parameters:

          each call last time=3 second

          each measurement last time = 15 minutes

   2. subscriber data parameters:

          caller subscriber number = callee subscriber number = 16000

   The format of SIP subscriber terminal ID is like 8xxxxxxx@bj.dsn.com.
   The callers and callees must be registered before bulk call
   performance measurement. All these registered subscribers and calls
   handled by each PN are randomly averagely distributed in system. Our
   algorithm can ensure the approximate well-proportioned distribution
   for registered subscribers and calls handled by each PN.

   We measured the bulk call transaction performance when the demo
   system respectively included 24, 32, 40, 48, 56 PN nodes. We
   collected the following parameters:

   1.Registration statistics: average register time

   2.Call Establishment time: average call setup time, average call tear
   down time, Post dial delay

   3.Call finish: call success ratio, call attempts per second(CAPS)

   If the call lose ratio is below 0.5% and don't persist to increase,
   we think the call performance is under the limit of the system.

   We do two measurements: 1)there are only callers and callees in the
   demo system; 2)except the callers and callees, there are some other
   users which originate registration for simulating the transfer from
   one place to another and the number of these users is one fifth of
   the total users.

4.2.1. Pure bulk call performance measurement results

   Note: the maximal call capability of the demo system increases along
   with the number of PN nodes and it goes beyond the maximal capability

4.2.3. conclusions

   Through above measurement, the conclusions are:

   1. The DSN VoIP system has the capability for call transaction.

   2. The system capability can approximately linearly increase as the
      number of PN nodes increase.

   We have measure the bulk call performance for the demo system.
   However due to measurement time limited, these results are just
   elementary and further measurement will be done for more large scale
   network.

4.3. Churn measurement

4.3.1. Churn model and setting

   The P2P overlay will churn when there are some nodes arriving or
   leaving. Generally we can give some assumption:

   1. one node has the the probability p% to arise churn in an hour for
      leaving or poweroff etc and the churning node will equably
      distribute in the network.

   2. The churn will occur with the periods of T1 minutes in the P2P
      network and p% of all nodes will leave the P2P overlay.

   3. After T2 minutes, the total leaving nodes will return the P2P
      overlay with the probability q%. T2 must be less than T1.

   Because we use backup mechanisms for user's information, if one node
   leaves the overlay, its backup nodes will take on the incoming calls.
   When the node leaves the overlay, it will lead to call errors.

   If one node return the overlay, it will get its previously possessed
   information from the backup nodes and this action will lead to
   generate new traffic(we call these traffic as recover traffic). These
   traffics will influence the network bandwidth and increase as the
   total number of the all users.

   Based on the above discuss, for simplifying and accelerating the
   measurements, we set some supreme values for the measurement as
   follows:

   1.  p = 5, 10, 20, q = 80

   2.  T1 = 10 minutes, T2 = 4 minutes

   3.  Number of users = 100 thousands, 300 thousands, 500 thousands,
      1000 thousands

   We do churn measurements under different p and number of users in the
   demo system with 58 PN nodes. Because we don't care the bulk call
   performance under churn, we use test device to originate 1800caps

   call in each measurement and the settings for the calls are the same
   as section 4.2.

   We collected the following parameters:

   1. Call success ratio: call success establishment compared to all
   call.

   2. Call error: call fail caused by either caller or callee. we
   randomly get the call errors from two arbitrary nodes which leave and
   return the overlay.

   3. sampled recover traffics: we randomly get the recover traffics
   from two arbitrary nodes which leave and return the overlay.

4.3.2. Measurement results

   The following are the results.

   1. p = 5% (about 3 nodes involved in churn at the same time)

4.3.3. conclusions

   Through above measurement, the conclusions are:

   1. The recover traffic will increase as the total users increase.

   2. If the churn involves a small quantity of PN nodes, the churn has
   little effect to the system call transaction performance and almost
   is independent of the total user's number.

5. Validation of DSN VoIP system in real environment

5.1. Overview

   We establish a small DSN VoIP demo network over the internet to
   validate the DSN VoIP system's usability in real internet.

   The demo network is deployed in three cities: Beijing, Shenzhen and
   Wuhan. This network includes 7 PN nodes, three in Beijing, two in
   Shenzhen and two in Wuhan.

   These seven PNs have different configuration: the PNs in Wuhan use
   common PCs, the PNs in Shenzhen use virtual machines in a common PC
   and the PNs in Beijing use virtual machines in two HP DL320 servers.

   The local network in each place belongs to different operator network,
   the PNs in Wuhan use CERNET, the PNs in Shenzhen use China Telecom's
   IP network and the PNs in Beijing use China Mobile's IP network. The
   access bandwidth for each point is quite different. The access
   bandwidth for these three locations is shared bandwidth, there are
   some other traffics on the same access point, we don't know how much
   bandwidth is used by the other traffic and how the other traffic may
   affect the available bandwidth for the DSN VoIP traffic.

Internet-Draft               p2psip bcp                 March 11, 2011


   (Note: we do many measurements for different number of PNs in three
   cities and here only choose a typical measurement due to limited
   space.)

5.2. Single Capabilities measurement

   For measuring the performance of the DSN VoIP demo network, we
   configure the following parameters:

   1. call parameters:

          call length =20 second

          Total call number = 200,000

   2. subscriber data parameters:

          caller number = callee number = 100,000

   The callers and callees must be registered before measurement. All
   these registered subscribers and calls handled by each PN are
   randomly averagely distributed in system. So there are one sixth
   calls between Beijing and Beijing, one sixth between Beijing and
   Wuhan, one six between Beijing and Shenzhen, one sixth between
   Shenzhen and Shenzhen, one sixth between Shenzhen and Wuhan, one
   sixth between Wuhan and Wuhan. We guess that these circs may occur,
   namely the least time for the calls is the calls between Beijing and
   Beijing, then the calls between Shenzhen and Shenzhen and the calls
   between Wuhan and Wuhan, the calls between different cities will take
   much longer time than the two cases.

   Since there are no standards for Internet VoIP, we don't know how to
   evaluate the results of this measurement. We refer to [2] and [2]
   gives some performance referenced parameters for mobile calls.

   Every caller will finish two calls during the measurement if no error
   happens. We collected the following results:

   1.  Call Response time(msec)-CR time

       Minimum: 63       Average: 195        Maximum: 6122

       Call Response time is the time when the first 100 trying message
   is received after Invite is sent.

       In Sec 3.2.3.1 of [2], the mean value for CR time is required to
   be less than 800ms and it doesn't exceed 1000ms with 0.95 probability.

   In our test about 85% CR times in successful calls doesn't exceed
   1000ms.

   2.  Call setup(msec)-CS time

       Minimum: 73       Average: 1548         Maximum: 24525

       In Sec 3.2.3.8 of [2], the mean value for CS time is required to
   be less than 2200ms and it doesn't exceed 2400ms with 0.95
   probability. In our test, about 76% CS times in successful calls
   doesn't exceed 2400ms.

   3.  Tear Down(msec)-TD time

       Minimum: 17       Average: 919        Maximum: 19735

       In Sec 3.2.3.5 of [2], the mean value for TD time is required to
   be less than 400ms and it doesn't exceed 700ms with 0.95 probability.
   In our test, about 82% TD times in successful calls doesn't exceed
   700ms.

   4.  Post Dial delay(msec)-PD time

       Minimum: 73       Average: 1544       Maximum: 24528

       In Sec 3.2.3.7 of [2], the mean value for PD time is required to
   be less than 175ms and it doesn't exceed 350ms with 0.95 probability.
   In this measurement, less than 45% PD times in successful calls
   doesn't exceed 350ms.

   From the above results, we can see these results show much difference
   with the results in lab environment, for example, the average call
   setup time is much higher in real network. We give a brief analysis
   as following:

   1. The measurement spans three operator's network so that the traffic
      go cross too many different network and it can lead to long
      transmission delay. If the long transmission delay exceeds the
      threshold of some timers, it will lead the call fail. For example,
      we do traceroute from Shenzhen to Beijing and find there are 16
      hops between these two points. In lab environment, there is only
      one hop between every pair of PNs and the ping delay is under 5ms.

   2. For security, the PNs in these three points are all behind
      firewall though these PNs have public IP addresses. The firewall
      has its secure policy for every stream and inspects every
      ingoing/outgoing packet. So the firewall's action has some impact

      on the communication between PNs. We find that the communication
      between two neighbor PNs is often lost for some reasons and this
      badly affect the call success ratio. In lab environment, there is
      no firewall and direction communication between PNs.

   3. Since the PNs in different points have different configuration,
      the PN has different call transaction capability. In DSN VoIP
      system, the calls distributed for each PN are approximately
      uniform, as the call traffic increases gradually, the PN with the
      lowest configuration will lead to call fails firstly. In lab
      environment, all PNs have the same configuration and the call fail
      has an even distribution.

5.3. conclusions

   Through above measurement, the conclusions are:

      1. The DSN VoIP system can work in global internet and doesn't
        perform well compared with the tests in lab environment.

      2. Some issues obviously affect the performance of the system, e.g.
        limited IP interconnection bandwidth, firewall configuration,
        heterogeneous platform configuration.

   Due to many unpredictable reasons in the WAN, these results show much
   ununiformity which can't be seen in the lab environment.

6. Security Considerations

   This draft does not introduce any new security issues.

7. IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

8. Conclusions

   Through the measurement for the demo system, we validate that DSN
   VoIP system is a potential operationable system, which has good call
   transaction capability, high reliability and availability to settle
   some key problem mentioned in Sec2.2 at a certain extent.

   The call transaction capability of DSN VoIP system can linearly
   increase as the server continuously joins the overlay. And this makes
   it possible that we can provide Carrier-grade call transaction
   capability by using normal computer server.

   The DSN VoIP system has an excellent anti-churn capability so that
   this overcomes the single point failure and provides the high network
   and service reliability for subscribers.

   The measurement in real WAN shows that the DSN VoIP system can be
   deployed in the internet and affected by many unpredictable issues.
