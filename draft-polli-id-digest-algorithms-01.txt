                 The "id-" prefix for Digest Algorithms
                  draft-polli-id-digest-algorithms-01

Abstract

   This document defines the "id-" prefix for digest-algorithms used in
   the Digest HTTP field.  This prefix explicits that the value of the
   digest-algorithm is independent from Content-Encoding.

1.  Introduction

   The [DIGEST] defines a way to convey a checksum of a representation-
   data as specified in [SEMANTICS].

   As the representation data depends on the value of "Content-
   Encoding", it is useful to convey the checksum value of a
   representation without any content-coding applied.

   This proposal introduces the "id-" prefix to specify that the
   provided digest-algorithm value is computed on the representation-
   data without any content-coding applied.

Internet-Draft   The "id-" prefix for Digest Algorithms    December 2020


1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.  These words may also appear in this
   document in lower case as plain English words, absent their normative
   meanings.

   This document uses the Augmented BNF defined in [RFC5234] and updated
   by [RFC7405].

   The definitions "representation", "selected representation",
   "representation data", "representation metadata", and "payload body"
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in [SEMANTICS].

   The definitions "digest-algorithm" and "representation-data-digest"
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in [DIGEST].

2.  The "id-" prefix for digest-algorithms

   A digest-algorithm to be registered within the HTTP Digest Algorithm
   Values (https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-dig-alg/http-dig-
   alg.xhtml) MUST NOT start with the string "id-".

   The following two examples show two digest-algorithm names that
   cannot be registered

      id-crc32c
      id-adler32

   For every digest-algorithm registered in the HTTP Digest Algorithm
   Values (https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-dig-alg/http-dig-
   alg.xhtml) the associate "id-" digest-algorithm has the following
   properties:

   *  the checksum is computed on the representation-data of the
      resource when no content coding is applied;

   *  the checksum is computed according to the original digest-
      algorithm Description field, and uses the same encoding of the
      original digest-algorithm.

   This definition is compatible, and thus extends, the definition of
   the "id-sha-256" and "id-sha-512" digest-algorithms contained in
   Section X of [DIGEST].

3.  Security Considerations

3.1.  Disclosure of encrypted content

   Like the "id-sha-256" digest-algoritm defined in [DIGEST] if the
   content-coding provides encryption features, sending the checksum of
   unencoded representation can disclose information.

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  TBD how to reserve "id-" prefix?

5.  Examples

5.1.  The id-crc32c digest-algorithm

   The following request conveys a brotli encoded json object

   {"hello": "world"}

   The "Digest" computed using the "crc32c" digest-algorithm present in
   HTTP Digest Algorithm Values (https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-
   dig-alg/http-dig-alg.xhtml) is content-coding aware, while its
   associated "id-" digest-algorithm is not "id-crc32c"

   POST /data HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json
   Content-Encoding: br
   Digest: id-crc32c=43794720, crc32c=DB329237

Code Samples

   _RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication._

   How can I generate and validate the "Digest" values shown in the
   examples throughout this document?

   The following python3 code can be used to generate digests for json
   objects using crc32c algorithm.  Note that these are formatted as
   base64.  This function could be adapted to other algorithms and
   should take into account their specific formatting rules.
