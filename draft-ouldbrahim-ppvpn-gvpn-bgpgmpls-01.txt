     Abstract 
         
        Consider a service provider network that offers Provider-
        provisioned Port-based Generalized VPN service (GVPN).  
        The service is a Port-based VPN, where the basic unit of the 
        service is a Label Switched Path (LSP) between a pair of 
        customer's ports. The service is "generalized" as the 
        interfaces on the customer's ports and provider ports could be 
        any of the interfaces supported by Generalized MPLS (GMPLS). 
         
        An important goal of such service is the ability to support 
        what is known as "single end provisioning", where addition of a 
        new port to a given VPN would involve configuration changes 
        only on the devices connected to that port. Another important 
        goal of such service is the ability to establish/terminate an 
        LSP between a pair of (existing) customer's ports within a VPN 
        without involving configuration changes in any of the provider 
        devices.  
         
        In this document we describe a set of mechanisms built around 
        BGP as a VPN auto-discovery, and GMPLS as a signaling that 
        accomplishes these goals. 
      
         
      
      
     1. Sub-IP Summary ID 
      
        This ID targets the PPVPN working group as it deals with a VPN 
        solution similar to the existing port-based VPNs. It describes 
        an approach to allow service providers to offer GMPLS based VPN 
        services. A pair of client devices (a router, a SONET/SDH 
        cross-connect, or an Ethernet switch) could be connected

        through the service provider network via an LSP. It is this LSP 
        that forms the basic unit of service that the service provider 
        network offers.

        WHERE DOES IT FIT IN THE PICTURE OF THE SUB-IP WORK 
         
        Fits the PPVPN box. 
         
        WHY IS IT TARGETED AT THIS WG 
         
        This WG is looking at port based VPN over an IP/MPLS 
        infrastructure. This work is exactly a port-based VPN using IP 
        related building blocks. 
         
        JUSTIFICATION 
         
        The current PPVPN chairs have already discussed this work and 
        are considering expanding the PPVPN charter to include 
        Generalized Port-based VPN as part of PPVPN mandate.  
      
      
     2. Generalized Port-Based VPN Reference Model 
      
         
        Consider a service provider network that consists of devices 
        that supports Generalized MPLS (e.g., Optical Cross Connect, 
        SDH Cross Connect, etc_). Following the framework suggested in 
        [PPVPN-FRAMEWORK], we partition these devices into P (provider) 
        and PE (provider edge) nodes (in the context of this document 
        we'll refer to these devices as just "PE"). The P nodes are 
        connected only to the nodes within the provider's network (in 
        the context of this document we'll refer to these devices as 
        just "P"). The PEs are connected to the other nodes within the 
        provider network (either Ps, or PEs), as well as to the devices 
        outside of the provider network. We'll refer to such other 
        devices as Client Edge Devices (CEs). An example of a CE would 
        be a router, or an SDH cross-connect, or an Ethernet switch.

        A CE is connected to a PE via one or more links.In the context 
        of this document a link is the same as a GMPLS Traffic 
        Engineering (TE) link construct, as defined in [GMPLS-ROUTING]. 
        In the context of this document a link is a logical construct 
        that is used to represent grouping on a per VPN basis of 
        physical resources used to connect a CE to a PE. Interfaces at 
        the end of each link could be any of the interfaces that are 
        supported by GMPLS. Likewise, CEs and PEs could be any devices 
        that are supported by GMPLS (e.g, optical cross connects, SDH 
        cross-connects, LSRs, etc_). 
         
        Each link may consist of one or more channels or sub-channels 
        (e.g., wavelength or wavelength and timeslot respectively). For 
        purpose of this discussion we assume that all the channels 
        within a given link have shared similar characteristics (e.g., 
        bandwidth, encoding, etc_), and can be interchanged from the 
        CEs point of view. Channels on different links of a CE need not 
        have the same characteristics.  

        There may be more than one link between a given CE PE pair. A 
        CE may be connected to more than one PE (with at least one port 
        per each PE). And, of course, a PE may have more than one CE 
        connected to it.  
         
        If a CE is connected to a PE ONE via multiple links and all 
        these links belong to the same VPN, then for the purpose of  
        this document these links could be treated as a single link 
        using the link bundling constructs [LINK-BUNDLING]. 
      
      
     Ould-Brahim, et al.           June 2002                       [Page 4] 
        draft-ouldbrahim-ppvpn-gvpn-bgpgmpls-01.txt       December 2002 
      
      
        In general a link may have only data bearing channels, or only 
        control bearing channels, or both.  For the purpose of this 
        discussion we assume that for a given CE-PE pair at least one 
        of the links between them has at least one data bearing 
        channel, and at least one control bearing channel, or there is 
        an IP connectivity between the CE and the PE that could be used 
        for exchanging control information (more on this in Section 4).  
      
        A link has two end-points - one on CE and one on PE. In the 
        context of this document we'll refer to the former as "CE 
        port", and to the latter as "PE port". From the above it 
        follows that a CE is connected to a PE via one or more ports, 
        where each port may consists of one or more channels or sub-
        channels (e.g., wavelength or wavelength and timeslot 
        respectively), and all the channels within a given port have 
        shared similar characteristics (e.g., bandwidth, encoding, 
        etc_), and can be interchanged from the CEs point of view. 
        Channels on different ports of a CE need not have the same 
        characteristics. Just like links, in the context of this 
        document ports are logical construct that 
        are used to represent grouping of physical resources on a per 
        GVPN basis that are used to connect a CE to a PE.  
         
        At any given point in time, a given port on a PE is associated 
        with at most one GVPN, or to be more precise with at most one 
        Port Information Table (although different ports on a given PE 
        could be associated with different GVPNs, or to be more precise 
        with different Port Information Tables). This association is 
        established and maintained by the service provider provisioning 
        system.  
         
        A pair of CEs could be connected through the service provider 
        network via an LSP. It is precisely this LSP that forms the 
        basic unit of the GVPN service that the service provider 
        network offers. If a port by which a CE is connected to a PE 
        consists of multiple channels (e.g., multiple wavelengths), the 
        CE could establish LSPs to multiple other CEs over this single 
        port. 
         
        An important goal in the GVPN service is the ability to support 
        what is known as "single end provisioning", where addition of a 
        new port to a given GVPN would involve configuration changes 
        only on the PE that has this port and on the CE that is 
        connected to the PE via this port. Another important goal in 
        the GVPN service is the ability to establish/terminate an LSP 
        between a pair of (existing) ports within a GVPN without 
        involving configuration changes in any of the provider's 
        devices. The mechanisms outlined in this document aim at 
        achieving these goals. Specifically, as part of the GVPN 
        service offering, these mechanisms (1) enable the service 
        provider to restrict the set of ports that a given port could 
        be connected to, (2) enable the service provider to provide a CE 
      
     Ould-Brahim, et al.           June 2002                       [Page 5] 
        draft-ouldbrahim-ppvpn-gvpn-bgpgmpls-01.txt       December 2002 
      
      
        with the information about the ports that the CE could be 
        connected, (3) enable a CE to establish the actual LSP to a 
        subset of ports provided by (2). Finally, the mechanisms allow 
        different GVPN topologies to be supported ranging from hub-and-
        spoke to complete mesh. 
         
      
        The service provider does not initiate the creation of an LSP  
        between a pair of PE ports. This is done rather by the CEs, 
        which attach to the ports. However, the SP, by using the 
        mechanisms outlined in this document, restricts the set of 
        other PE ports which may be the remote endpoints of LSPs that 
        have the given port as the local endpoint. Subject to these 
        restrictions, the CE-to-CE connectivity is under the control of 
        the CEs themselves. In other words, SP allows a GVPN to have a 
        certain set of topologies (expressed as a port-to-port 
        connectivity matrix), and CE-initiated signaling is used to 
        choose a particular topology from that set. 
      
         
        Since this model involves minimal provisioning changes when 
        changing the connectivity among the ports within a GVPN on the 
        providers network and the GVPNs themselves are controlled by 
        the CEs, the tariff structure may be on a port basis or 
        alternatively tariffs could be triggered on the basis of 
        signaling mechanisms. 
      
        Finally, it is assumed that establishing CE-to-CE LSPs is based 
        on GMPLS signaling [GMPLS]. 
         
         
     3. Overview of operations 
         
        This document assumes that within a given GVPN each port on a 
        CE that connects the CE to a PE ONE has an identifier that is 
        unique within that GVPN (but need not be unique across several 
        GVPNs). One way to accomplish this is to assign each port an IP 
        address that is unique within a given GVPN, and use this 
        address as a port identifier. Another way to accomplish this is 
        to assigned each port on a CE an index that is unique within 
        that CE, assign each CE an IP address that is unique within a 
        given GVPN, and then use a tuple <port index, CE IP address> as 
        a port identifier.  
      
        This document assumes that within a service provider network, 
        each port on a PE has an identifier that is unique within that 
        network. One way to accomplish this would be to assign each 
        port on a PE an index that is unique within that PE, assign 
        each PE an IP address that is unique within the service 
        provider network (in the case of multi-provider operations, the 
        address has to be unique across all the providers involved),

        identifier within the provider network.

        Figure 2 Generalized VPN Components 
         
      
        As a result, each link connecting the CE to the PE is 
        associated with a CE port that has a unique identifier within a 
        given GVPN, and with a PE port that has a unique identifier 
        within the service provider network. We'll refer to the former 
        as the customer port identifier (CPI), and to the latter as the 
        provider port identifier (PPI). 
         
        This document assumes that in addition to PPI, each port on PE 
        has also an identifier that is unique within the GVPN of that 
        port.  One way to accomplish this is to assign each port an IP 
        address that is unique within a given GVPN, and use this 
        address as a port identifier. Another way to accomplish this is 
        to assign each port an index that is unique within a given PE, 
        assign each PE an IP address that is unique within a given GVPN 
        (but need not be unique within the service provider network), 
        and then use a tuple <port index, PE IP address> acts as a port 
        identifier.  We'll refer to such port identifier as VPN-PPI.  
        Note that PE IP address used for VPN-PPI need not be the same 
        as PE IP address used for PPI. If for a given port on a PE its 
        PPI and VPN-PPI are both unnumbered, then they both could use 
        exactly the same port index. 
         
      
     Ould-Brahim, et al.           June 2002                       [Page 7] 
        draft-ouldbrahim-ppvpn-gvpn-bgpgmpls-01.txt       December 2002 
      
      
        Note that IP addresses used for CPIs, PPIs and VPN-PPIs could 
        be either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. 
         
        For a given link connecting a CE to a PE, if CPI is an IP 
        address, then VPN-PPI has to be an IP address as well. And if 
        CPI is an <port index, CPI IP address>, then VPN-PPI has to be 
        an <port index, PE IP address>. However, for a given port on 
        PE, whether VPN-PPI of that port is an IP address or an <port 
        index, PE IP address> is independent of whether PPI of that 
        port is an IP address or an <port index, PE IP address>. 
         
        This document assumes that assignment of PPIs is controlled 
        solely by the service provider (without any coordination with 
        the GVPN customers), while assignment of CPIs and VPN-PPIs is 
        controlled solely by the GVPN that the CPIs and VPN-PPIs belong 
        to. And, of course, each GVPN could assign its CPIs and VPN-
        PPIs on its own, without any coordination with other GVPNs. 
         
        Each PE maintains a Port Information Table (PIT) for each GVPN 
        that has at least one port on that PE. A PIT contains a list of 
        <CPI, PPI> tuples for all the ports within its GVPN. 
         
        A PIT on a given PE is populated from two sources: the 
        information related to the CEs' ports attached to the ports on 
        that PE ONEs (this information could be optionally received 
        from the CEs), and the information received from other PEs. 
        We'll refer to the former as the "local" information, and to 
        the latter as the "remote" information.  
         
        Propagation of local information to other PEs is accomplished 
        by using BGP VPN auto-discovery procedures, as specified in 
        [BGP-VPN-AUTODISCOVERY]. To restrict the flow of this 
        information to only the PITs within a given GVPN, we use BGP 
        route filtering based on the Route Target Extended Community 
        [BGP-COMM], as follows. 
         
        Each PIT on a PE is configured with one or more Route Target 
        Communities, called "export Route Targets", that are used for 
        tagging the local information when it is exported into 
        provider's BGP. The granularity of such tagging could be as 
        fine as a single <CPI, PPI> pair. In addition, each PIT on a PE 
        is configured with one or more Route Target Communities, called 
        "import Route Targets", that restrict the set of routes that 
        could be imported from provider's BGP into the PIT to only the 
        routes that have at least of these Communities.    
         
        When a service provider adds a new GVPN port to a particular 
        PE, this port is associated at provisioning time with a PIT on 
        that PE, and this PIT is associated (again at provisioning 
        time) with that GVPN.  
         

      
     Ould-Brahim, et al.           June 2002                       [Page 8] 
        draft-ouldbrahim-ppvpn-gvpn-bgpgmpls-01.txt       December 2002 
      
      
        Once a port is configured on the PE, the CE that is attached 
        via this port to the PE MAY pass to the PE the CPI information 
        of that port. This document assumes that this is accomplished 
        by using BGP  (however, the document doesn't preclude the use 
        of other mechanisms).  
      
        This information, combined with the PPI information available 
        to the PE, enables the PE to create a tuple <CPI, PPI> for such 
        port, and then use this tuple to populate the PIT of the GVPN 
        associated with that port. 
         
        In order to establish an LSP, a CE needs to identify all other 
        CEs in the CE's GVPN it wants to connect to. A CE may already 
        have obtained the CE list through configuration or through some 
        other schemes (such schemes are outside the scope of this 
        draft). 
         
        It is also desirable, that the service provider, as a value 
        added service, may provide a CE with a list of all other CEs in 
        the CE's GVPN. This is accomplished by passing the information 
        stored in the PE PITs to the attached CE. A way to accomplish 
        this is by using BGP Multi-protocol extensions (however this 
        draft doesn't preclude other mechanisms to be used). Although 
        optional, this draft recommends the PE to signal to the 
        attached CEs the remote CPIs it learnt from the remote CEs part 
        of the same GVPN. A CE may decide to initiate an LSP setup 
        request to a remote CE only when it learns the CPI of the 
        remote CE from the PE. This has the benefit to avoid rejecting 
        LSP setup request while the PE is populating the PITs. 
         
        Once a CE obtains the information about the CPIs of other ports 
        within the same GVPN, which we'll refer to as "target ports", 
        the CE uses a (subset of) GMPLS signaling, as described in 
        Section 4, to request the provider network to establish an LSP 
        to a target port.  
         
        The request originated by the CE contains the CPI of the port 
        on the CE that CE wants to use for the LSP, and the CPI of the 
        target port. When the PE attached to the CE that originated the 
        request receives the request, the PE identifies the appropriate 
        PIT, and then uses the information in that PIT to find out the 
        PPI associated with the CPI of the target port carried in the 
        request. The PPI should be sufficient for the PE to establish 
        an LSP. Ultimately the request reaches the CE associated with 
        the target CPI (note that the request still carries the CPI of 
        the CE that originated the request). If the CE associated with 
        the target CPI accepts the request, the LSP is established.  
         
        Note that a CE need not establish an LSP to every target port 
        that CE knows about - it is a local to the CE matter to select 
        a subset of target ports to which the CE will try to establish 
        LSPs. 
      
     Ould-Brahim, et al.           June 2002                       [Page 9] 
        draft-ouldbrahim-ppvpn-gvpn-bgpgmpls-01.txt       December 2002 
      
      
         
        A port, in addition to its CPI and PPI may also have other 
        information associated with it that describes characteristics 
        of the channels within that port, such as encoding supported by 
        the channels, bandwidth of a channel, total unreserved 
        bandwidth within the port, etc. This information could be 
        further augmented with the information about certain 
        capabilities of the Service Provider network (e.g., support 
        RSOH DCC transparency, arbitrary concatenation, etc_). This 
        information is used to ensure that ports at each end of an LSP 
        have compatible characteristics, and that there are sufficient 
        unallocated resources to establish an LSP. Distribution of this 
        information (including the mechanisms for distributing this 
        information) is identical to the distribution of the <CPI, PPI> 
        information. Distributing changes to this information due to 
        establishing/terminating of LSPs is identical to the 
        distribution of the <CPI, PPI> information, except that 
        thresholds should be used to contain the volume of control 
        traffic caused by such distribution.  
         
        It may happen that for a given pair of ports within a GVPN, 
        each of the CEs connected to these ports would concurrently try 
        to establish an LSP to the other CE. If having a pair of LSPs 
        between a pair of ports is viewed as undesirable, the way to 
        resolve this is to require the CE with the lower value of CPI 
        to terminate the LSP originated by the CE. This option could be 
        controlled by configuration on the CE devices. 
         
     4. Signaling between CE and PE (Simple UNI -SUNI) 
       
        Signaling between CE and PE uses a (proper) subset of GMPLS 
        signaling [GMPLS]. 
         
        For the purpose of GMPLS signaling between CE and PE, this 
        document assumes that there is an IP control channel between 
        the CE and the PE. This channel could be either a single IP 
        hop, or an IP private network, or even an IP VPN. We'll refer 
        to the CE's address of this channel as the CE Control Channel 
        Address (CE-CC-Addr), and to the PE's address of this channel 
        as the PE Control Channel Address (PE-CC-Addr). Both CE-CC-Addr 
        and PE-CC-Addr are required to be unique within the GVPN they 
        belong to, but are not required to be unique across multiple 
        GVPNs. Assignment of CE-CC-Addr and PE-CC-Addr are controlled 
        by the GVPN these addresses belong to. 
         
        Multiple ports on a CE could share the same control channel 
        only as long as all these ports belong to the same GVPN. 
        Likewise, multiple ports on a PE could share the same control 
        channel only as long as all these ports belong to the same 
        GVPN.  
         

      
     Ould-Brahim, et al.           June 2002                      [Page 10] 
        draft-ouldbrahim-ppvpn-gvpn-bgpgmpls-01.txt       December 2002 
      
      
        When a CE sends an RSVP Path message to a PE, the source IP 
        address in the IP packet that carries the message is set to the 
        appropriate CE-CC-Addr, and the destination IP address in the 
        packet is set to the appropriate PE-CC-Addr. When the PE sends 
        back to the CE the corresponding Resv message, the source IP 
        address in the IP packet that carries the message is set to the 
        PE-CC-Addr, and the destination IP address is set to the CE-CC-
        Addr. 
         
        Likewise, when a PE sends an RSVP Path message to a CE, the 
        source IP address in the IP packet that carries the message is 
        set to the appropriate PE-CC-Addr, and the destination IP 
        address in the packet is set to the appropriate CE-CC-Addr. 
        When the CE sends back to the PE the corresponding Resv 
        message, the source IP address in the IP packet that carries 
        the message is set to the CE-CC-Addr, and the destination IP 
        address is set to the PE-CC-Addr. 
         
        In addition to being used for IP addresses in the IP packet 
        that carries RSVP messages between CE and PE, CE-CC-Addr and 
        PE-CC-Addr are also used in the Next/Previous Hop Address field 
        of the IF_ID RSVP_HOP object that is carried between CEs and 
        PEs. 
         
        In the case where a link between CE and PE is a numbered non-
        bundled link, the CPI and VPN-PPI of that link are used for the 
        Type 1 or 2 TLVs of the IF_ID RSVP HOP object that is carried 
        between the CE and PE. In the case where a link between CE and 
        PE is an unnumbered non-bundled link, the CPI and VPN-PPI of 
        that link are used for the IP Address field of the Type 3 TLV. 
        In the case where a link between CE and PE is a bundled link, 
        the CPI and VPN-PPI of that link are used for the IP Address 
        field of the Type 3 TLVs. 
         
        When a CE originates a Path message to establish an LSP from a 
        particular port on that CE to a particular target port the CE 
        uses the CPI of its port in the Sender Template object. If the 
        CPI of the target port is an IP address, then the CE uses it in 
        the Session object. And if the CPI of the target port is a 
        <port index, IP address> tuple, then the CE uses the IP address 
        part of the tuple in the Session object, and the whole tuple as 
        the Unnumbered Interface ID subobject in the ERO. When the Path 
        message arrives at the ingress PE, the PE selects the PIT 
        associated with the GVPN, and then uses this PIT to map CPIs 
        carried in the Session and the Sender Template objects to the 
        appropriate PPIs. Once the mapping is done, the ingress PE 
        replaces CPIs with these PPIs. As a result, the Session and the 
        Sender Template objects that are carried in the GMPLS signaling 
        within the service provider network carry PPIs, and not CPIs. 
        At the egress PE, the PE performs the reverse mapping _ it maps 
        PPIs carried in the Session and the Sender Template object into 

      
     Ould-Brahim, et al.           June 2002                      [Page 11] 
        draft-ouldbrahim-ppvpn-gvpn-bgpgmpls-01.txt       December 2002 
      
      
        the appropriate CPIs, and then sends the Path message to the CE 
        that has the target port.  
         
         
         
     5. Encoding  
         
        This section specifies encoding of various information defined 
        in this document. 
         
     5.1 Encoding of channel characteristics in GMPLS Signaling 
         
        [TBD] 
         
     5.2 Encoding of CPI, PPI, and channel characteristics in BGP 
         
        This section defines encoding of the GVPN-specific information 
        in BGP. 
      
     5.2.1 Encoding of CPI and PPI information in BGP 
      
        The <CPI, PPI> mapping is carried using the Multiprotocol 
        Extensions BGP [RFC2858]. [RFC2858] defines the format of two 
        BGP attributes, MP_REACH_NLRI and MP_UNREACH_NLRI that can be 
        used to announce and withdraw the announcement of reachability 
        information. We introduce a new address family identifier (AFI) 
        for GVPN (to be assigned by the IANA), a new subsequent address 
        family identifier (to be assigned by the IANA), and also a new 
        NLRI format for carrying the CPI and PPI information. 
      
        One or more <PPI, CPI> tuples could be carried in the above 
        mentioned BGP attributes.  
      
        The format of encoding a single <PPI, CPI> tuple is shown in  
        Figure 3 below: 
      
      
             +---------------------------------------+ 
             |     Length (1 octet)                  | 
             +---------------------------------------+ 
             |     PPI AFI (2 octets)                | 
             +---------------------------------------+ 
             |     PPI Length (1 octet)              | 
             +---------------------------------------+ 
             |     PPI (variable)                    | 
             +---------------------------------------+ 
             |     CPI AFI (2 octets)                | 
             +---------------------------------------+ 
             |     CPI (length)                      | 
             +---------------------------------------+ 
             |     CPI (variable)                    |

     6. One vs more than one GVPN 
         
        The solution described in this document requires each customer 
        port to be in at most one GVPN, or to be more precise requires 
        each customer port connected to a given PE to be associated 
      
     Ould-Brahim, et al.           June 2002                      [Page 13] 
        draft-ouldbrahim-ppvpn-gvpn-bgpgmpls-01.txt       December 2002 
      
      
        with at most one PIT on that PE. It has been asserted that this 
        requirement is too restrictive, as it doesn't allow to realize 
        certain connectivity scenarios. To understand why this 
        assertion is incorrect we'd like to make several observations.  
         
        First, the solution described in this document allows control 
        connectivity between customers' ports at the granularity of 
        individual ports. This is because each local port on a PE could 
        have its own PIT, and the granularity of the information that 
        is used to populate this PIT could be as fine as a single 
        remote port (port on some other PE).  
         
        Second, ports that are present in a given PIT need not have the 
        same administrative control. For example, some ports in a given 
        PIT may belong to the same organization (have the same 
        administrative control) as the local ports associated with that 
        PIT, while some other ports in exactly the same PIT may belong 
        to organizations different from the one associated with the 
        local ports. In that sense, a single PIT could combine both an 
        Intranet and an Extranet. 
         
        As a result, it should be abundantly obvious to the informed 
        reader that the solution described in this document allows to 
        realize any arbitrary inter-port connectivity matrix. 
        Therefore, no other solution could be less restrictive than 
        then one described in this document.  
         
         
     7. Exchanging VPN-ID between CE and PE 
         
        The solution described in this document assumes that an 
        association of a particular port on a CE with a particular GVPN 
        (or to be more precise with a particular PIT on a PE) is done 
        by the GVPN service provider, as part of the provisioning the 
        port on the PE (associating the PE's port with a particular 
        PIT, and connecting the CE's port with the PE's port). Once 
        this association is established, the CE could request 
        establishment of an LSP to any customer's port present in the 
        PIT. Important to note that in order to select a particular 
        port within the PIT for the purpose of establishing an LSP to 
        that port the only information that the CE needs to identify 
        that port is the CPI of that port. Also important to note that 
        the CPI is either an IP address, or a combination of <port 
        index, IP address>, but it doesn't include any such thing as 
        VPN-ID. 
         
        Therefore, the solution described in this document doesn't 
        involve exchanging VPN-IDs between CE and PE in (GMPLS) 
        signaling. Moreover, the lack of exchanging VPN-ID in signaling 
        has no adverse effect on the ability to support any arbitrary 
        inter-port connectivity matrix, and more generally on the 
        flexibility of the solution described here. 
      
     Ould-Brahim, et al.           June 2002                      [Page 14] 
        draft-ouldbrahim-ppvpn-gvpn-bgpgmpls-01.txt       December 2002 
      
      
         
         
      
     8. Other issues 
      
        Since the protocol used to populate a PIT with remote 
        information is BGP, since BGP works across multiple routing 
        domains, and since GMPLS signaling isn't restricted to a single 
        routing domain, it follows that the mechanisms described in 
        this document could support an environment that consists of 
        multiple routing domains.  
         
        The mechanisms described in this document allow for a wide 
        range of choices with respect to addresses used for CPI, PPI, 
        and VPN-PPI. For example, one could use either IPv4 addresses, 
        or IPv6 addresses, or NSAPs. Different GVPN customers of a 
        given service provider may use different types of addresses. 
        Moreover, different GVPNs attaching to the same PE  may use 
        different addressing schemes. The types of addresses used for 
        PPIs within a given service provider network are independent 
        from the type of addresses used for CPI and VPN-PPI by the GVPN 
        customers of that provider. 
         
        While in the context of this document a CE is a device that 
        uses the GVPN service, such a device, in turn, could be used to 
        offer VPN services (e.g., RFC2547, Virtual Routers, Layer 2 
        VPNs) to other devices (thus becoming a PE with respect to 
        these devices). Moreover, a CE device that uses the GVPN 
        service could, in turn be used to offer GVPN services to other 
        devices (thus becoming a PE  with respect to these devices). 
         
         
     9. Security Considerations 
         
        Since association of a particular port with a particular GVPN 
        (or to be more precise with a particular PIT) is done by the 
        service provider as part of the service provisioning process 
        (and thus can't be altered via signaling between CE and PE), 
        and since signaling between CE and PE is assumed to be over a 
        private network (and thus can't be spoofed by entities outside 
        the private network), the solution described in this document 
        doesn't require authentication in signaling.
