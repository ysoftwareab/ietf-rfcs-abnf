Internet-Draft   The IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Option for Geocast    December 2016


Abstract

   For IPv6-based ITS applications, ITS data packets are required to
   be delivered to a specific destination area, which is called geocast.
   In this draft, a new IPv6 Hop-by-Hop option, the IPv6 Geocast
   Hop-by-Hop option, with the geographical information of the
   destination area and the forwarding mechanism information is defined.

1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   
2.  Introduction

   For the support of IPv6-based ITS (Intelligent Transportation System)
   applications, ITS data packets are required to be delivered based
   on the geographical location (longitude and latitude) information of
   the destination ITS node or area. The latter is called geocast
   [Geocast].

   From the considerations in [Geo-Problem], in this draft, we define
   the new IPv6 Geocast Hop-by-Hop option with the geo-location
   information of the center point and the radius information of
   the destination area. Also, the IPv6 Geocast Hop-by-Hop option
   has the fields for the geographical unicast mechanism
   from the originator to the center point of the destination area and
   the geographical broadcast mechanism from the center point to
   all the ITS nodes in the destination area.


3. Terminology

   ITS node
      A vehicle or a device that may generate ITS-related data
      in the form of IPv6 datagrams

   Geo-location
      The location of an ITS node represented in the form of
      longitude and latitude. The geo-location information
      is represented in the form of the World Geodetic System 1984
      (WGS84) [WGS-84] formatted coordinates.

   Geographical Forwarding
      IPv6 datagram forwarding based on the geo-location information
      of the source and the destination ITS node or area.
      Geographical unicast/broadcast and geocast belong to geographical
      forwarding.

   Geographical Unicast (Geo-unicast)
      IPv6 datagram forwarding based on geo-location information
      to a specific single target ITS node which can be a vehicle or
      roadside unit (RSU) or any type of an IPv6 node.

Internet-Draft   The IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Option for Geocast    December 2016


   Geo-Broadcast
      IPv6 datagram broadcasting to all the ITS nodes within a specific
      geographical area based on geo-location information.
      It can be done by flooding, etc.

   Geocast
      IPv6 datagram forwarding from an ITS node to the ITS nodes
      in a specific target destination area based on geo-location
      information. Geocast is performed by geographical unicast to
      the center point of the destination area and, then, geographical
      broadcast within the destination area.

   Destination Area
      The geographical area in which this IPv6 datagram needs to be
      forwarded by geocast; that is, all the ITS nodes in the
      destination area are supposed to receive this IPv6 datagram.

   Originator
      The source ITS node that has generated this IPv6 datagram.

   Sender
      The previous hop ITS node that has forwarded this IPv6 datagram.


4. Hop-by-Hop Option for Geocast

   The format of the Geocast Hop-by-Hop option is as follows:

   IPv6 Source Address
      The Source IPv6 Address field of the IPv6 datagram is set to
      the IPv6 address of the originator.

   IPv6 Destination Address
      The Destination IPv6 Address field of the IPv6 datagram is set to
      the geocast group address to be assigned by IANA.

   Option Type
      The IPv6 Option Type code for IPv6 geocast; to be assigned
      by IANA.

   Option Data Length
      The number of octets of the option data field of this option.

   C Flag
      This indicates the geographical casting type. 'C = 0' implies
      geographical unicast and 'C = 1' implies geocast.
      Thus, in this case, C = 1.
