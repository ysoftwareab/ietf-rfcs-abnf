Abstract 
    
   This specification defines a Management Information Base (MIB) for 
   use with SNMP-based network management. In particular, it defines 
   objects for configuring, monitoring, and controlling routers that 
   employ the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol  for both IPv4 and IPv6 
   as defined in RFC xxxx (RFC-editor, this is currently draft-ietf-
   vrrp-spec-v2-09.txt) and RFC yyyy (RFC-editor, this is currently 
   draft-ietf-vrrp-ipv6-spec-04.txt ). This memo obsolates RFC 2787.

1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 
    
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 
   ofRFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
    
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally 
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). 
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the 
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB 
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,

   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 
   [RFC2580]. 
    
2.  Revision History 
    
   This is the first draft. 
    
 
3. Overview 
    
   VRRP protocols as defined in draft-ietf-vrrp-spec-v2-09.txt [RFC 
   xxxx] and draft-ietf-vrrp-ipv6-spec-04.txt [RFCyyyy] are inherently 
   IP version specific. Though both the protocols are similar they are 
   not identical and can coexist on a network element. RFC 2787 
   [RFC2787] defines managed objects that are specific to VRRP protocol 
   for IPv4 networks as defined in RFC 2338 [RFC2338]. This document 
   defines an IP version independent managed objects for configuring and 
   monitoring VRRP for  protocols.  
     
   VRRPv2 and VRRPv3 protocols are similar in operation to an extent and 
   hence the MIB defined has common groups that should be implemented by 
   devices running either of the VRRPv2 and VRRPv3 protocols. This 
   specification also defines MIB groups that are specific to a 
   particular VRRP protocol and should only be implemented in devices 
   supporting the specified version of VRRP protocol. 
    
3.1 Multi-Stack Implementations 
    
   This MIB is designed to support Multi-Stack implementations that run 
   both VRRPv2 and VRRPv3 protocols. As MAC address for the interface is 
   calculated based on the VRID, a different VRID should be used for 
   VRRPv2 and VRRPv3 running on a given interface. Thus indexing the 
   common tables on VRID and ifIndex should suffice to uniquely identify 
   rows in a multi stack implementation.  
     
3.2 VRRP MIB Structure 
    
   The VRRP MIB contains three groups: 
      - vrrpOperations Group: Objects related to VRRP router's     
        configuration and control. 
      - vrrpStatistics Group: Objects containing information useful in     
        monitoring the operation of VRRP IPv6 routers. 
      - vrrpNotifications Group: Consists of objects and definitions 
        for use in SNMP notifications sent by VRRP Ipv6 routers. 
       
   It also defines a VRRPv2 specific table: 
      - The vrrpAssoIpAddrTable, which contains the addresses of the 
        virtual router(s) that a given VRRP router is backing up. 
    
 
 
Tata, karlekar & Jewell  Expires - April 2004                 [Page 3] 
INTERNET-DRAFT             VRRP unified MIB              October 2003 
 
 
   Tables in the MIB include the following: 
    
   (1)The vrrpOperTable, which contains objects that define the 
        operational characteristics of a VRRP router. Rows in this table 
        correspond to instances of virtual routers. 
   (2)The vrrpRouterStatsTable which contains the operating statistics 
        for a VRRP IPv6 router. 
   (3)The vrrpAssoIpAddrTable, which contains the addresses of the 
        virtual router(s) that a given VRRP router is backing up. This 
        table is required only for VRRPv2 implementations. 
    
3.3 VRRP MIB Table Design 
    
   The tables in the VRRP MIB are structured with the assumption that a 
   VRRP network management application would likely be designed to 
   display information or provide configuration about a VRRP router on a 
   "per-virtual-router basis". Thus, the tables defined in the MIB 
   consist of conceptual rows which are grouped in a manner to present a 
   view of individual virtual routers with a minimal number of SNMP 
   operations. 
    
3.4 Relation to Interface Group (IF-MIB) 
    
   Since a router can be participating in VRRP on one or more physical 
   interfaces, "ifIndex" is used as an index into the tables defined in 
   the VRRP MIB. 
    
3.5 VRRPv2 Scenario 
    
   The following section provides examples of how some of the objects in 
   this MIB are instantiated. 
    
    
   KEY: 
   ---- 
    
   The labels in the following tables and diagrams correspond to the 
   actual MIB objects as follows: 
    
   if      = IfIndex 
   VrId    = vrrpOperVrId 
   State   = vrrpOperState 
   Prior   = vrrpOperPriority 
   AddrType= vrrpOperIpAddrType 
   IpAddr  = vrrpOperMasterIpAddr 
   RowStat = vrrpOperRowStatus 
    
   The following figure shows a simple network with two VRRPv2 routers 
   configured with two virtual routers. This sample topology is taken

   from the VRRP specification [xx]. Addresses in '()' indicate the  
   address of the default gateway for a given host, H1 - H4. In the 
   diagram, "Interface" is used in the context defined in IF-MIB [xx].

5. Security considerations 
    
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module 
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such 
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
 
 
Tata, karlekar & Jewell  Expires - April 2004                [Page 27] 
INTERNET-DRAFT             VRRP unified MIB              October 2003 
 
 
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their 
   sensitivity/vulnerability: 
    
   A number of objects in the vrrpOperTable possess the read-create 
   attribute. Manipulation of these objects is capable of affecting the 
   operation of a virtual router. 
    
   Specific examples of this include, but are not limited to: 
    
   o The vrrpOperAdminState object which could be used to disable a 
   virtual router. 
    
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), 
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is 
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects 
   in this MIB module. 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as 
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), 
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for 
   authentication and privacy). 
    
   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to 
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate 
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9. Changes from RFC 2787 
    
   - General rewrite to change MIB definition to accommodate protocol 
     changes in virtual router functionality from RFC 2338 and to 
     accomidate VRRP for IPv6. 
   - Change all definitions of IPaddress to InetAddress and add 
     InetAddressType as defined in RFC 3291 in the following : 
        o vrrpOperTable defined with vrrpOperIpAddrType and 
          vrrpOperMasterIpAddr. 
   - Added vrrpIpv6StatsAsMasterUpTime to vrrpIPv6Statisctcs group. 
   - Authentication has been removed from VRRPv2 and there is no 
     authentication mechanism defined in VRRP for IPv6 protocol. So all 
     authentication related configuration, statistics and notifications 
     are removed. 
   - Added ifIndex and vrrpOperVrId to vrrpTrapNewMaster. 
   - Added new trap to indicate various errors encountered by the VRRP 
     protocol. 
   - Added ErrorReason to indicate the reason for vrrpErrorTrap. 
   - Updated mib description with copyright information. 
   - Modify conformance statement to reflect changes in vrrpOperGroup 
     and vrrpStatsGroup.
