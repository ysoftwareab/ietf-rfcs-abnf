Abstract

   This document specifies the updated format of the Nonce extension in
   Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) request and response
   messages.  OCSP is used to check the status of a certificate and the
   Nonce extension is used in the OCSP request and response messages to
   avoid replay attacks.  This document updates the RFC 6960.

1.  Introduction

   This document updates the usage and format of the Nonce extension
   used in OCSP request and response messages.  This extension was
   previously defined in section 4.4.1 of [RFC6960].  The [RFC6960] does
   not mention any minimum and maximum length of the nonce extension.
   Due to not having an upper or lower limit of the length of the Nonce
   extension, the OCSP responders that follow [RFC6960] may be
   vulnerable to various attacks like Denial of Service attacks
   [RFC4732], chosen prefix attacks to get a desired signature from the
   OCSP responder and possible evasions that can use the Nonce extension
   data for evasion.  This document specifies a lower limit of 1 and an
   upper limit of 32 to the length of the Nonce extension.  This
   document updates the [RFC6960].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  OCSP Extensions

   The message format for the OCSP request and response is defined in
   the [RFC6960].  [RFC6960] also defines the standard extensions for
   OCSP messages based on the extension model employed in X.509 version
   3 certificates (see [RFC5280]).  The following is a list of standard
   extensions that can be used in the OCSP messages by the OCSP
   responder and OCSP client.

   *  Nonce
   *  CRL References
   *  Acceptable Response Types
   *  Archive Cutoff
   *  CRL Entry Extensions
   *  Service Locator
   *  Preferred Signature Algorithms
   *  Extended Response Definition

   This document only specifies the new format for Nonce extension and
   does not change the specification of any of the other standard
   extensions.

2.1.  Nonce Extension

   This section replaces the entirety of the Section 4.4.1 of [RFC6960]
   which describes the OCSP Nonce extension.

   The nonce cryptographically binds a request and a response to prevent
   replay attacks.  The nonce is included as one of the
   requestExtensions in requests, while in responses it would be
   included as one of the responseExtensions.  In both the request and
   the response, the nonce will be identified by the object identifier
   id-pkix-ocsp-nonce, while the extnValue is the value of the nonce.
   If Nonce extension is present then the length of nonce MUST be at
   least 1 octet and can be up to 32 octets.

   A server MUST reject any OCSP request having a Nonce extension with
   length of 0 octets or more than 32 octets with the malformedRequest
   OCSPResponseStatus as described in section 4.2.1 of [RFC6960].

   The value of the nonce MUST be generated using a cryptographically
   strong pseudorandom number generator (see [RFC4086]).  The OCSP
   clients SHOULD use a length of 32 octets for the Nonce extension.
   The minimum nonce length of 1 octet is defined to provide the
   backward compatibility with older clients following [RFC6960]
   however, the newer OCSP clients MUST use a length of at least 16
   octets for Nonce extension.  The OCSP responder MAY choose to ignore

Internet-Draft            OCSP Nonce Extension            September 2020


   Nonce extension for the requests where length of the Nonce extension
   is less than 16 octets.

      id-pkix-ocsp           OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ad-ocsp }
      id-pkix-ocsp-nonce     OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pkix-ocsp 2 }

      Nonce ::= OCTET STRING(SIZE(1..32))

3.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of OCSP, in general, are described in the
   [RFC6960].  The Nonce extension is used to avoid replay attacks
   during the interval in which the previous OCSP response for a
   certificate is not expired but the responder has a changed status for
   that certificate.  Including client's Nonce value in the OCSP
   response makes sure that the response is the latest response from the
   server and not an old copy.

3.1.  Replay Attack

   The Nonce extension is used to avoid replay attacks.  Since the OCSP
   responder may choose to not send the Nonce extension in the OCSP
   response even if the client has sent the Nonce extension in the
   request [RFC5019], an on-path attacker can intercept the OCSP request
   and respond with an earlier response from the server without the
   Nonce extension.  This can be mitigated by configuring the server to
   use a short time interval between thisUpdate and nextUpdate fields in
   the OCSP response.

3.2.  Nonce Collision

   If the value of the nonce used by a client in OCSP request is not
   random enough, then an attacker may prefetch responses with the
   predicted nonce and can replay them, thus defeating the purpose of
   using nonce.  Therefore the value of Nonce extension in the OCSP
   request MUST contain cryptographically strong randomness and MUST be
   freshly generated at the time of creating the OCSP request.  Also if
   the length of the nonce extension is too small e.g. 1 octet then an
   on-path attacker can prefetch responses with all the possible values
   of the nonce and replay a matching nonce.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not call for any IANA actions.

5.  Changes to Appendix B. of RFC 6960

   This section updates the ASN.1 definitions of the OCSP Nonce
   extension in the Appendix B.1 and Appendix B.2 of the [RFC6960] The
   Appendix B.1 defines OCSP using ASN.1 - 1998 Syntax and Appendix B.2
   defines OCSP using ASN.1 - 2008 Syntax

5.1.  Changes to Appendix B.1.  OCSP in ASN.1 - 1998 Syntax

   OLD Syntax:

   The definition of OCSP Nonce Extension is not provided in the
   Appendix B.1 of [RFC6960] for the ASN.1 - 1998 Syntax.

   NEW Syntax:

       Nonce ::= OCTET STRING(SIZE(1..32))

5.2.  Changes to Appendix B.2 OCSP in ASN.1 - 2008 Syntax

   OLD Syntax:

       re-ocsp-nonce EXTENSION ::= { SYNTAX OCTET STRING IDENTIFIED
           BY id-pkix-ocsp-nonce }


   NEW Syntax:

       re-ocsp-nonce EXTENSION ::= { SYNTAX OCTET STRING(SIZE(1..32))
           IDENTIFIED BY id-pkix-ocsp-nonce }
