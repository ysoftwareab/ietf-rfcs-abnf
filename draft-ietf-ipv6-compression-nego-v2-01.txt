Abstract 
    
      The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a standard method of 
      encapsulating Network Layer protocol information over  
      point-to-point links.  PPP also defines an extensible Link Control  
      Protocol, and proposes a family of Network Control Protocols  
      (NCPs) for establishing and configuring different network-layer  
      protocols. 
       
      The IPv6 Control Protocol (IPv6CP), which is an NCP for a PPP 
      link, allows for the negotiation of desirable parameters for the 
      IPv6 interface over PPP.

1. Introduction 
    
      PPP [1] has three main components: 
    
      1) A method for encapsulating datagrams over serial links. 
    
      2) A Link Control Protocol (LCP) for establishing, configuring,  
         and testing the data-link connection. 
    
      3) A family of Network Control Protocols (NCPs) for establishing  
         and configuring different network-layer protocols. 
    
      In order to establish communications over a point-to-point link,  
      each end of the PPP link must first send LCP packets to  
      configure and test the data link.  After the link has been  
      established and optional facilities have been negotiated as  
      needed by the LCP, PPP must send NCP packets to choose and  
      configure one or more network-layer protocols.  Once each of the  
      chosen network-layer protocols has been configured, datagrams  
      from each network-layer protocol can be sent over the link. The 
      link will remain configured for communications until  
      explicit LCP or NCP packets close the link down, or until some  
      external event occurs (power failure at the other end, carrier  
      drop, etc.). 
    
      In the IPv6 over PPP specification [2], the NCP, or IPv6CP, for  
      establishing and configuring the IPv6 over PPP is defined. The

      same specification defines the Interface Identifier parameter, 
      which can be used to generate link-local and global unique IPv6  
      addresses, for negotiation.  
    
      In this specification, the compression parameter for use in IPv6  
      datagram compression is defined. 
          
1.1 Specification of Requirements 
    
      In this document, several words are used to signify the  
      requirements of the specification. 
    
      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL  
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and  
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described  
      in [3]. 
    
2.  IPV6CP Configuration Options 
    
      IPV6CP Configuration Options allow negotiation of desirable IPv6 
      parameters.  IPV6CP uses the same Configuration Option format  
      defined for LCP [1] but with a separate set of Options.  If a  
      Configuration Option is not included in a Configure-Request  
      packet, the default value for that Configuration Option is  
      assumed. 
 
      The only IPV6CP option defined in this document is the IPv6- 
      Compression-Protocol.  The Type field for this IPV6CP Option is as 
      follows: 
    
            2 IPv6-Compression-Protocol 
             
      Note that the up-to-date values of the IPV6CP Option Type field 
      are specified in the on-line database of "Assigned Numbers" 
      maintained at IANA [4].   
                 
2.1 IPv6-Compression-Protocol 
 
      Description 
      This Configuration Option provides a way to negotiate the use of a 
      specific IPv6 packet compression protocol.  The  
      IPv6-Compression-Protocol Configuration Option is used to indicate 
      the ability to receive compressed packets.  Each end of the link 
      MUST separately request this option if bi-directional compression 
      is desired.  By default, compression is not enabled.  
       
      IPv6 compression negotiated with this option is specific to IPv6 
      datagrams and is not to be confused with compression resulting

      from negotiations via Compression Control Protocol (CCP), which 
      potentially affect all datagrams. 
        
      A summary of the IPv6-Compression-Protocol Configuration Option 
      format is shown below.  The fields are transmitted from left to 
      right.

        IPv6-Compression-Protocol 
    
         The IPv6-Compression-Protocol field is two octets and indicates 
         the compression protocol desired.  Values for this field are 
         always the same as the PPP Data Link Layer Protocol field 
         values for that same compression protocol. 
    
         No IPv6-Compression-Protocol field values are currently 
         assigned. Specific assignments will be made in documents that 
         define specific compression algorithms. 
    
        Data 
    
         The Data field is zero or more octets and contains additional 
         data as determined by the particular compression protocol. 
    
    
    
        Default 
    
          No IPv6 compression protocol enabled. 
    
3. Security Considerations

      Lack of proper link security, such as authentication, prior to 
      the data transfer may lead to such attacks as the man-in-the 
      middle resulting in the loss of data integrity and 
      confidentiality. The mechanisms that are appropriate for ensuring 
      PPP link security are addressed below together with the reference 
      to a generic threat model. 
 
      The mechanisms that are appropriate for ensuring PPP link 
      Security are: 1) Access Control Lists that apply filters on 
      traffic received over the link for enforcing admission policy, 2)  
      an Authentication protocol that facilitates negotiations between 
      peers [5] to select an authentication method (e.g., MD5 [6]) for 
      validation of the peer, and 3) an Encryption protocol that 
      facilitates negotiations between peers to select encryption 
      algorithms (or,  crypto-suites) to ensure data confidentiality 
      [7]).  
 
      There are certain threats associated with peer interactions on a 
      PPP link even with one or more of the above security measures in 
      place. For instance, using MD5 authentication method [6] exposes 
      one to replay attack, where in which, an attacker could intercept 
      and replay a station's identity and password hash to get access 
      to a network. The user of this specification is advised to refer 
      to [5], which presents a generic threat model, for an 
      understanding of the threats posed to the security of a link. The 
      reference [5] also gives framework to specify requirements for 
      the selection of an authentication method for a given 
      application. 
       
4. IANA Considerations  
 
      The author has no specific recommendations for the IANA on the 
      assignment of a value for the Type field of IPv6 datagram 
      compression option specified in this specification. The current  
      assignment is up-to-date at [4]. However, the IANA should take  
      note that the PPP Data Link Layer number for the  
      IPV6-Compression-Protocol configuration option is same as that of  
      the IPV6CP Configuration options, which is listed in the  
      RFC 3818 [8]. To insure proper review of the same, the Editor 
      Would like to place it under IETF consensus process.
