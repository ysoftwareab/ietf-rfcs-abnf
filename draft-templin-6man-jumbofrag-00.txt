          Transmission of IPv6 Jumbograms as Atomic Fragments
                    draft-templin-6man-jumbofrag-00

Abstract

   Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) provides a service for
   transmission of IPv6 packets larger than 65,535 octets known as
   "jumbograms".  Such large packets are not eligible for fragmentation,
   and the current specification forbids the inclusion of a fragment
   header of any kind.  However, some implementations may wish to
   include an Identification value with each jumbogram; hence this
   document proposes the transmission of IPv6 jumbograms as "atomic
   fragments".

1.  Introduction

   Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) [RFC8200] provides a jumbogram
   service for transmission of IPv6 packets larger than 65,535 octets
   [RFC2675].  Such large packets are not eligible for fragmentation,
   and the current specification forbids sources from including a
   Fragment Header of any kind.  However, some implementations may wish
   to include an unpredictable Identification value with each jumbogram
   [RFC7739].  This document therefore proposes the transmission of IPv6
   jumbograms as "atomic fragments" and in the process updates
   [RFC2675].

   Atomic fragments are defined as "IPv6 packets that contain a Fragment
   Header with the Fragment Offset set to 0 and the M flag set to 0"
   [RFC6946].  Such Fragment Headers may be inserted by the original
   source only and may not be modified by any intermediate IPv6 nodes on
   the path.  Hence, an atomic fragment generated by the original source
   will remain as an atomic fragment along the entire path up to and
   including the final destination.  The original source should
   therefore be permitted to include an atomic fragment Fragment Header
   in the jumbograms it produces.  The following section recommends
   updates to [RFC2675] to permit the transmission of IPv6 jumbograms as
   atomic fragments.

2.  RFC2675 Updates

   The following updates to [RFC2675] are requested:

   o  Section 3, third paragraph, change: "The Jumbo Payload option must
      not be used in a packet that carries a Fragment header" to: "The

      Jumbo Payload option must not be used in a packet that carries a
      non-atomic Fragment header [RFC6946]".

   o  Section 3, in the list of errors, change: "error: Jumbo Payload
      option present and Fragment header present" to: "error: Jumbo
      Payload option present and non-atomic Fragment header present".

   o  Add [RFC6946] to Informative References.

3.  Implementation Status

   TBD.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA considerations.

5.  Security Considerations

   Communications networking security is necessary to preserve
   confidentiality, integrity and availability.

6.  Acknowledgements
