Abstract

   This document provides solutions for control plane signaling, in
   accordance with the control plane framework developed in the DetNet
   WG. The solutions cover distributed, centralized, and hybrid
   signaling scenarios in the TSN and SDN domain. We propose changes to
   RSVP IntServ for a better integration with Layer 2 technologies for
   resource reservation, outlining example API specifications for the
   realization of the revised RSVP (called RSVP-detnet in the document).

INTERNET DRAFT       DetNet Control Plane Signaling                     


1  Introduction

   The authors in [ID.malis-detnet-controller-plane-framework-03]
   provide an overview of the DetNet control plane architecture along
   three possible classes, namely (i) fully distributed control plane
   utilizing dynamic signaling protocols, (ii) a centralized, SDN-like,
   control plane, and (iii) a hybrid control plane. We structure the
   following sections of this draft along those three classes in order
   to present example solutions for each class of the DetNet control
   plane architecture. Specifically, Section 2 will present a solution
   for a Bridged Ethernet deployment scenario. We will introduce changes
   to RSVP with the proposal for an RSVP-DetNet model that splits
   resource style and sender selection between sender and receiver,
   unlike in RSVP for IntServer, for an optimized realization of L2
   integrations.

   Section 3 will present a solution that realizes a centralized SDN-
   based approach for switched Ethernet deployment scenarios. 

   Section 4 will finally outline a hybrid solution in an SDN domain
   with path allocation through signaling and switching configuration as
   a centralized solution. 

   At this stage, Section 3 and 4 will be detailed in future updates to
   the draft.

1.1  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology established in the DetNet
   Architecture [RFC8655], and the reader is assumed to be familiar with
     that document and its terminology.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2  Distributed Control in Bridged TSN-based Ethernet Deployment

   The first solution addresses deployments of bridged TSN-based
   customer Ethernet network, possibly interconnected through DetNet IP
   flows for multi-site deployment. 

2.1 Overview

   Figure 1 provides an example deployment of TSN-based Ethernet edge
   (customer) networks, using the RSVP/RAP combined signaling presented
   in the following sections. The customer sites are interconnected via
   edge routers that aggregate DetNet IP flow requirements from hosts

   for reservation of aggregated flows within the core network. 

   Starting point from an DetNet perspective is the RSVP IntServ model
   with guaranteed QoS. Resource Allocation Protocol (RAP), as defined
   in [RAP_IEEE], is an example of a target lower layer reservation
   mechanism. In this section, we focus on the necessary integration of
   the RSVP and RAP concepts to enable such (and similar) deployment.

2.2 RAP Reservation in TSN vs RSVP IntServ Model

   Layer2 reservation in TSN-based networks is supported through RAP,
   providing a maximum of 8 classes of traffic where the frame priority
   code point (PCP) is used to select the Resource Allocation (RA) class
   at the ingress bridge. Streams within a single RA class are queued in
   a single traffic class where the latency of the stream is guaranteed
   per hop and per RA class.

   This model contrasts with the RSVP IntServ [RFC2212] model, which
   provides a flow bandwidth driven latency model with a separate
   transmission queue per flow, not a class-based model like in the
   aforementioned RAP model. 

   This difference in models poses a number of challenges:

   1. Is RSVP IntServ (as defined in [RFC2212]) the right starting
      point?

   2. How to efficiently map the different reservation styles of RSVP
      onto RAP?

   3. What is the nature of the RSVP-RAP interface?

   4. How is the binding between L3 signaling (RSVP IntServer) and L2
      signaling (RAP ) realized, e.g., mapping of Stream-ID?


   The following sub-sections elaborate on the various aspects in
   addressing those challenges.

2.3 Interactions between L2 and L3

   Figure 2 provides an overview of the interactions between L2 and L3
   elements in a network deployment as an elaboration of the elements in
   Figure 1.

   The application utilizes an application-specific QoS API (qAPI) that
   controls and signals the establishment of deterministic end-to-end
   flows via the DetNet API (dAPI) between the L3 control plane entities
   in the L3 end systems and routers, utilizing the dUNI, based on RSVP,
   at Layer 3. 

   The DetNet lower API (dlAPI) maps the RSVP model onto the RAP model
   and signals the establishment of appropriate L2 segments via the TSN
   API (tAPI) between the L2 control plane entities of the end systems,
   routers, and L2 bridges, utilizing the tUNI, based on RAP, at Layer
   2.

   The L2 CP entities in turn control the establishment of appropriate
   resources on the HW bridge (with no specification for the handling of
   resource reservations on the end systems).

   Within the DetNet router (on the right side of Figure 2), the second
   L2 control plane entity bridges to the second Ethernet sub-network.

   Based on the above interactions, the main body of work is the
   proposed change to RSVP, dubbed RSVP-DetNet, for an efficient mapping
   of L3 to L2, and motivated in Section 2.5, while we will present the
   various API specifications in Figure 2 throughout Section 2.6,
   including an example mapping between dlAPI and RAP in Section 2.6.3. 

   Before doing so, we will outline similarities and differences in the
   RSVP and RAP models at Layer 3 and 2, respectively. 

2.4 Similarities and Differences between RSVP and RAP

   The following sub-sections will outline various aspects to be
   considered when designing the RSVP-RAP interface, namely the
   assumptions on network nodes (Section 2.4.1), the mapping of the
   latency model used in both models (Section 2.4.2), the dealing with
   latency margins (Section 2.4.3), the dealing with Jitter and non-
   shaping nodes (Section 2.4.4), and the mapping of resource
   reservation styles (Section 2.4.5). 

2.4.1 Assumptions on Network Nodes

   RSVP assumes three different nodes over which a reservation can be
   done, namely 
   - Shaping node, which implements the RSVP signaling and shaping on
     the data plane, 

   - None shaping node, which implements the RSVP signaling and is
     capable of estimating the latency caused by this node

   - Legacy node, which does neither implement RSVP nor any shaping.



   RAP assumes properties common to all nodes within a reservation
   domain:
   - All nodes take part in the signaling process

INTERNET DRAFT       DetNet Control Plane Signaling                     


   - Different data plane architectures are supported albeit limited to
     those defined in IEEE 802.1Q.

   - Bridging between different (heterogeneous) data planes is achieved
     through a peer-to-peer model where every upstream node is a talker
     for the next downstream node.


2.4.2 Mapping of Latency Model

   RSVP assumes a weighted fair queuing (WFQ) at the data plane, where a
   listener is able to influence therefore the latency through the
   reserved bandwidth per flow. 

   RAP assumes one traffic class with given interference per common RA
   class, resulting in a per hop latency for all stream within a single
   RA class. The E2E latency is just signaled by accumulating hop
   latency while the allowed interference determines the amount of
   allowed flow per RA class. Here, the listener is unable to influence
   the latency but the stream requirement is signaled upstream. 

2.4.3 Dealing with Latency Margins

   RSVP provides the notion of slack [RFC2212] per flow, which can be
   consumed by the processing node in the network to enable additional
   reservations.

   In RAP, every listener of a stream propagates its required latency
   upstream to the talker. Latency margins are not handled directly by
   RAP, while the per hop latency of an RA class is preconfigured by
   management. In each node, the per RA class upstream required latency
   of all streams can be used to locally calculate the latency margins
   per hop. The management system can then use this information to
   adjust the per hop maximum latency at runtime. 

2.4.4 Dealing with Jitter and Non-Shaping Nodes

   RSVP has two different parameters to propagate the maximum non-
   conformance to the leaky bucket model introduced through jitter and
   non-shaping nodes. These can be accumulated by non-shaping nodes,
   i.e., those which implement the RSVP protocol but are not performing
   shaping at the data plane. 

   Within RAP, there is no distinction between shaping and non-shaping
   nodes since all nodes adhere to the data plane architecture defined
   in IEEE 802.1Q. Heterogeneous data planes are possible as long as
   assurances to the next hop can be upheld, while RA class attributes
   are used to propagate data plane behavior (e.g., shaper) to the next

   neighbor.

2.4.5 Mapping Resource Reservation Styles

   RSVP uses the notion of 'sessions', which are able to maintain
   different kinds of end-to-end connectivity and resource styles,
   namely fixed (i) filter style, (ii) shared explicit style, and (iii)
   wildcard filter style - see [RFC2205]. It is important to note that
   in RSVP, both sender selection and resource styles are controlled by
   the receiver; we return to this issue in our next section. 

   RAP supports only distinct explicit mode of reservation, while in
   principle supporting reservation between one talker and multiple
   listeners or one listener and multiple scheduled talkers. Bridged
   Ethernet technology is also able to support the shared resource
   modes.

2.5. RSVP-DetNet

   In this section, we motivate the introduction of a new signaling
   model for RSVP in combination with sub-nets like TSN. We outline
   first the rationale for its introduction before outlining the
   proposed changes.

2.5.1. Rationale

   Continuing from Section 2.4.5. , in RSVP (for IntServ), the receiver
   initiates resource style and sender selection through the Resv
   message being sent upstream, while path state being setup through the
   Path message from the sender to the receiver upon receiving the Resv
   message.

   When looking into an integration with lower layer APIs, such as the
   TSN API, we identify key differences in WHEN these lower layer APIs
   decide if a reservation is possible:

 


Trossen, et al.          Expires April 25, 2021                 [Page 8]

INTERNET DRAFT       DetNet Control Plane Signaling                     


   1. For a new Announce downstream, each L2 node decides that if this
      stream was reserved at this port, would there be enough resources
      available to do so?

   2. For a new Attachment upstream, each L2 node will lock the required
      resources and bandwidth exclusively for this stream. For every L2
      node local non-locked Announce, the L2 node will decide the same
      question as in item 1 and refresh and propagate the necessary
      states accordingly.

   It is important to note that steps 1 and 2 only work if the 'resource
   style' is already known by the Announce propagation.

2.5.2. Splitting Control over Resource Style and Sender Selection

   In order to allow for an efficient resource reservation at the lower
   network level by implementing the steps 1 and 2 in Section 2.5.1. ,
   we propose to split the control over 'resource style' and 'sender
   selection' in that in RSVP-DetNet the sender controls the 'resource
   style' and the listener controls the 'sender selection'.

2.5.3. Coordinated Shared Resource Style

   Independent from the efficient realization of lower layer resource
   reservation, we have also identified a requirement in industrial use
   cases to support a large amount of deterministic connections with
   small data usage. In those cases, separate reservation for each
   connection could be inefficient. 

   To address this, we propose to introduce another 'resource style'
   called 'Coordinated Shared', which would indicate the use of
   scheduling (of those many deterministic connections) at L2-Listener
   and L3-Receiver level. A first proposal for a solution in the TSN RAP
   protocol was presented to the IEEE in [CHEN-IEEE]

2.6. API Specifications

   The following sub-sections describe the upper and lower Interfaces,
   following the proposed RSVP-DetNet changes, and provides an example
   mapping of the RSVP lower API to RAP in a TSN setup.

2.6.1. RSVP-DetNet upper API (duAPI)

   The RSVP-DetNet interface is oriented on the interface specified by
   RSVP-IntServ (RFC 2205). Most of the changes are due to mapping
   resource reservation styles (see chapter 2.4.5).

2.6.3. Example tAPI on RAP defined by IEEE 802.1Q

   The following section defines a preliminary interface for RAP (IEEE
   P802.1Qdd). Currently RAP draft version 0.3 is available and the
   service interface of RAP is not yet stable.

     Call: Open L2 Reservation Group

       - Sync Domain ID (extension for Coordinated Shared)

       - PATH Max frame size

       - Talker Loss Rate

     Notes:

     Traffic Specification Template is queue drain algorithm dependent

     For efficient mapping it has advantages when RAP supports all
     Resource Styles

     The Resource Style "Coordinated Shared" allows only one destination
     and all nodes must belong to the same sync domain

     PATH MTU frame size is determined downstream from Talker to
     Listener

     The Loss Rate is accumulated per Stream.

7. Conclusion

   This draft outlines the possible control plane signaling in
   deterministic networking environments for distributed, centralized
   and hybrid deployments. For the first, we have proposed the
   introduction of RSVP-detnet for a better alignment of the Layer 3
   signaling with that of emerging Layer 2 solutions, together with
   suggested API specifications for the realization of the L3 to L2
   interfaces in endpoints.
