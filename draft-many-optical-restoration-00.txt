Abstract

   With the advent of tunable lasers and optical switches, dynamic
   configuration of optical mesh networks has become possible. This
   Internet-Draft presents a signaling mechanism for provisioning
   schemes and dynamic lightpath restoration. The mechanisms proposed
   covers shared restoration (i.e. 1:1, 1:N and M:N) as well as
   provisioned and non-provisioned scheme. Provisioned restoration
   (equivalent to lightpath protection) implies the provisioning of
   backup lightpaths in advance before failures occur.


1. Introduction

   In general, Internet backbone networks are overbuilt in comparison
   to average traffic volumes, in order to support fluctuations in
   traffic levels and to stay ahead of traffic growth rates. Therefore,
   any given time there are typically under utilized capacity in
   deployed optical network facilities. Overbuilding of the backbone to
   support traffic fluctuations is part of the optical network design
   to meet the expected performance and the QoS provided.

   One of the most important concepts in network management is
   maintaining the survivability of networks and in particular the
   survivability of optical networks. When there are link failures or
   the like, any affected routes should be repaired as soon as
   possible. This mechanism is also referred to as fast restoration. In
   today's SONET/SDH networks, one can achieve recovery times of 50 ms
   or even lower, but this mechanism depends on the 1+1 backup optical
   network link resources to achieve this performance. To avoid this
   resources waste in optical networks, an adaptive 1:N or M:N shared
   restoration mechanism can be applied that still provides enhanced
   network survivability while minimizing the waste in network
   resources. When using these shared mechanisms, the protection paths
   can be used to transport best-effort traffic throughout the optical
   network.

   This Internet Draft proposes a mechanism for route computation and
   restoration processes that meet these goals in optical meshed
   networks, as well as the associated signaling extensions and
   notification message definitions.

   Note: in order to avoid the use of RSVP-TE and CR-LDP message in the
   first four sections of this memo, a generic terminology described in
   Appendix 1.

2. Basic concepts for bandwidth provisioning and restoration

   This section describes the basic concept of bandwidth provisioning
   and restoration mechanisms in optical networks.

                Draft-many-optical-restoration-00.txt   February 2001


   The Optical Cross-Connect (OXC) system architecture for lambda
   switching has been introduced in the [IPO-FRAME] and [IPO-MPLS]. The
   OXC interfaces considered hereafter includes, as described in
   [GMPLS-SIG], Lambda Switch Capable (LSC) interfaces that switches
   the lightpath segment based on the incoming wavelength and Fiber-
   Switch Capable (FSC) interfaces that switches the lightpath based on
   the spatial position of the incoming data stream in the real world
   physical spaces. Our proposed bandwidth provisioning and restoration
   mechanisms are based on this architecture.

   The internal processing in OXC system for lambda switching (i.e.
   wavelength switching) is briefly outlined hereafter. This
   description is presented only as an aid to understanding the content
   of the next sections.

   An OXC has several incoming and outgoing LSC interfaces or ports,
   connected to adjacent OXCs, and several incoming and outgoing LSC
   interfaces or ports attached to an edge device that can be a router
   (or any other termination capable device supporting LSC interface
   connectivity see [IPO-MPLS]). An OXC includes mainly two functional
   parts: an OXC Switch Controller (OSCtrl) and OXC optical matrix.

   The OSCtrl communicates through Optical Signalling Channels (OSC)
   i.e. out-of-band signaling transport mechanism or through dedicated
   and physically diverse control network i.e. out-of-network signaling
   transport mechanism as indicated in Figure 1. OSCtrls and OSCs
   together define the signalling plane of the optical network.

                (Fig.1) OSC Channel, OSC Controller and OXC


   The OSCtrl converts the received messages (mentioned in section 5)
   to the proper control command, and sends this command to the OXC
   optical matrix. The commands to control the OXC optical matrix are

                 Internet Draft û Expires August 2001                3

                Draft-many-optical-restoration-00.txt   February 2001


   as follows: connect (and disconnect) between an incoming LSC
   interface and an outgoing LSC interface. The OSCtrl is also capable
   to process status requests, lightpath modification requests as well
   as notification messages. The same commands apply when the OXC is
   connected to an LSC capable edge device. However, within the optical
   transport plane, lightpaths are strictly defined between the ingress
   and the egress OXC LSC interfaces.

   Based on these commands, a chain of connections through OXCs can
   form an end-to-end lightpath. The OXC initiating the lightpath
   creation process is called the ingress OXC, and the OXC ending a
   lightpath is called the egress OXC. The OXCs inside the lightpath
   are called the intermediate OXCs.

   An OXC optical matrix receives commands from the OSCtrl, and replies
   whether the command was successful or not. The OSCtrl then converts
   the result into a message (described in section 5) that it sends via
   the OSC channel throughout the optical network.

                     (Fig.2) OXC system architecture

   To cover any kind of optical network, we consider as specified in
   [IPO-FRAME] the following distinction between Optical Cross-Connect
   (OXC) in Transparent optical networks and Photonic Cross-Connect
   (PXC) in All-optical networks. Basically, OXC devices included
   within Transparent optical networks performs
   optical/electrical/optical (O/E/O) conversion at each of their

                 Internet Draft û Expires August 2001                4

                Draft-many-optical-restoration-00.txt   February 2001


   interfaces. Conversely, PXC devices included within All-optical
   networks do not perform O/E/O conversion at all so they are defined
   as pure O-O devices (including for most of them tunable lasers). As
   described in [GMPLS-SIG], we consider here that all the interfaces
   of a PXC are Lambda-Switch Capable (LSC) as well as all the
   interfaces of an OXC are Lambda Switch Capable.

2.2 Control channel between OXC switching controllers

   The OSCtrl communicates through Optical Signalling (i.e. control)
   Channels (OSC) i.e. in-fiber/out-of-band signaling transport
   mechanism or dedicated physically diverse control network or through
   out-of-network signaling transport mechanism. OSC signalling
   transport mechanism is described in [IPO-ONNI].

   We assume here that control channels between OSCtrl's must be
   continuously available in order to enable the exchange of signaling
   information. The details of the signalling fault tolerance
   mechanisms required are detailed in sub-section 4.3.2 (but limited
   here to the scope of notification mechanisms).

2.3 Gathering of link state information for lightpath computation

   Lightpath route computation (and selection) can be computed based
   on dynamic flooding of information related to optical network link
   resources, by using link state IGP protocol advertisements. Many
   mechanisms for exchanging the link state information have been
   introduced by extending existing IGP routing protocol such as OSPF
   [GMPLS-OSPF] or IS-IS [GMPLS-ISIS] for traffic-engineering purposes
   in optical network environment. This memo assumes that the link
   state information exchange mechanisms and eventually the bundling
   (or link bundling) mechanisms enabling the grouping of several links
   between adjacent OXCs is as described in [GMPLS-BUNDLE]. So, when a
   link state routing protocol is used, these links can be bundled
   together and be advertised in a single LSA.

   The minimum link state information required to select lightpaths can
   be described as follows:
   - the link identifier, status and the corresponding signal encoding
   - the link bandwidth (minimum/maximum reservable bandwidth and
   available bandwidth)
   - optionally the link protection type (unprotected 0:1, dedicated
   1:1, shared protection M:N and dedicated 1+1)

   Any ingress OXC has to know the SRLG (Shared Risk Link Group) list
   of every link to compute lightpath routes that do not share the same
   risk of potential damages. In the steady state, these SRLG values do
   not change, so this information is exchanged only once (at the
   initial optical network setup time). As described in [IPO-SRLG], the
   routing diversity constraint implies specific considerations with
   respect to the optical network topology.

                Draft-many-optical-restoration-00.txt   February 2001


   In order to know whether it is possible to switch an incoming
   wavelength to a different outgoing wavelength, the ingress OXC could
   also need to know the availability of lambda converters (i.e.
   tunable lasers) in all OXCs.

   Currently, we assume here that all OXCs have enough lambda
   converters for that purpose. If this assumption is not verified,
   then the switching process depends on the availability of the
   wavelength requested for a given lightpath. In this case, the
   wavelength blocking probability must be taken into account during
   the setup and the restoration process. This may lead to specific
   considerations like crank-back mechanism during lightpath setup
   process.


2.4 Lightpath Creation Process

   It is assumed that ingress OXC (or boundary intermediate OXC see
   [IPO-ONNI] and [IPO_FRAME]) functions will perform lightpath route
   computation and selection. However, in this Draft, we only consider
   the signaling procedures after the route (or the partial) of the
   lightpath (of the lightpath segment, respectively) is computed by a
   distributed CSPF algorithm. Since the signaling mechanisms are
   independent on the route computation and selection, the restoration
   procedures described here are quite general and apply to distributed
   optical network environments.

   In general, the establishment of an LSP by using GMPLS signaling
   [GMPLS-SIG] can be divided into two cases:
   - signalling-driven approach: pre-establishment before data traffic
   arrives at the ingress router in response to an explicit signalling
   request
   - data-driven approach: and post-establishment after data traffic
   arrives at the ingress router

   In the latter case, LSPs must be created quickly enough to handle
   the data traffic waiting at the ingress Label Switch Router (LSR)
   for transmission. However, the signalling-driven approach is the one
   considered here and we only refer to the data-driven approach for
   completeness.

   Nevertheless, even with data-driven approach, one might expect that
   the lightpath creation process will not in general be so intensive,
   as lightpath will only be created in response to long-term changes
   in traffic volume (note: long-term comparing to the time scale of
   the optical restoration one). Since several LSPs are generally
   multiplexed within the same lightpath, the granularity of the
   lightpath is coarser than the one of the LSPs it carriers.

   Moreover, since we assume that the permanent state [IPO-FRAME] is
   supported for the lightpath, the Bandwidth-on-Demand (BoD) model
   support will require high availability of the signaling plane (i.e.
   of the control channels). Consequently, some specific features such


                 Internet Draft û Expires August 2001                6

                Draft-many-optical-restoration-00.txt   February 2001


   as signaling fault-tolerance and signaling performance (i.e.
   signaling delay) are required when considering the lightpath create
   procedures.

3. Optical Restoration Mechanisms

   The ingress OXC (or intermediate OXC) is in charge of the creation,
   modification, deletion, and subsequently the restoration (or partial
   restoration) of lightpaths. This means that the ingress OXC will
   also assign the restoration-related parameters during the lightpath
   creation phase.

   First we compare the link protection to the link restoration
   mechanisms and analyze in detail the lightpath restoration
   procedures and the corresponding signalling enhancements in the
   remaining part of this document.

3.1 Link Protection and Restoration vs. Lightpath Restoration

   If we compare the optical restoration to the link (1+1) protection
   mechanism between OXC, then the following protection mechanism can
   be considered. For each of the link included in the primary
   lightpath route that needs to be protected, a dedicated link-
   disjoint backup route is setup in advance during the lightpath
   creation process. Switching from the primary to the backup route is
   executed when a link failure is detected.

   The link restoration mechanism is based on distributed recovery
   process. When a link failure is detected by the node(s) adjacent to
   the failure, the adjacent upstream node dynamically computes a route
   (for instance, from the adjacent upstream node to the adjacent
   downstream node) for each damaged lightpath traversing that failed
   link. Upon backup lightpaths establishment the upstream adjacent
   node and downstream adjacent nodes to the failure switch the failed
   primary lightpath to the corresponding backup lightpath.

   The lightpath restoration mechanism is based on the following edge-
   to-edge principle. When a link failure is detected by the node(s)
   adjacent to the link failure (or the node failure), they notify the
   ingress and egress nodes of each of the lightpaths traversing that
   failed link (or failed node). Then depending on the restoration
   scheme, the ingress and egress nodes compute the route of an end-to-
   end backup lightpath or use the provisioned end-to-end backup
   lightpath. When the backup lightpath is established the ingress and
   egress nodes switch from the failed primary lightpath to the backup
   lightpath.

   However, as described in the section 4 (see below), with non-
   revertive strategy, the provisioned restoration (which is equivalent
   to lightpath protection) operation is a particular case of the
   lightpath destructive modification procedure. On the other hand, the
   non-provisioned restoration is basically a triggered lightpath
   creation procedure.

3.2 Lightpath Failure Detection

   If an optical link is damaged physically, all the lightpaths passing
   through this link will be affected. Generally, in case of an all-
   optical network (i.e. transparent optical network) where all devices
   do not use Optical/Electrical/Optical (O/E/O) conversion, damage to
   a lightpath or drop of light signal level depends on the Loss of
   Light (LoL) detection capacity of the PXC. For that purpose the AND
   function of the LoLs on all terminated wavelengths channels can be
   used to detect the loss of the physical section (more precisely, the
   wavelengths changing device which can be based on an adaptation of
   the laser/detector). In practice, a LoL detector will be essential
   to provide at the end of the physical optical section in order to
   provide fault detection and localization.

   If the PXC supports this feature, a bi-directional LoL detection
   will be propagated from the source of the failure to the ingress and
   egress PXC by a Notification Message. Otherwise, if the PXC doesn't
   support LoL detection, this lost of signal will be triggered by the
   ingress OXC or the egress OXC depending on the transmission
   direction since the devices support O/E/O conversion at their LSC
   interfaces. The unidirectional LoL detection mechanism is detailed
   in section 4.3.

   Link failure detection used in all-optical networks can be compared
   with the current mechanisms used in SDH/Sonet networks:
   - LoF (Lost of Frame) is detected by monitoring A1 and A2 RS/Section
   overhead bytes. LoF is declared when valid values for these bytes
   are not received for a 3-ms time period. LoF is cleared when two
   consecutive valid A1 and A2 bytes are received.
   - LoS (Lost of Signal) occurs when an all zeroes pattern is received
   for 10 ´s or longer (indicating an upstream transmit failure).
   - AIS (Alarm Indication Signal) occurs as a result of a failure
   condition such as LoF or LoS and is used to notify downstream nodes
   that a failure has occurred. Line AIS is detected by 1's in bits 6 -
   8 of the K2 byte in five consecutive frames. AIS performs two
   functions: inform the intermediate nodes that a failure has been
   detected and notify that the connection end-point that the service
   is no longer available. Note that some proprietary implementations
   also provides to localization (i.e. the originating point) of the
   failure.
   - BER (Bit error rate): BER monitoring is handled by counting parity
   violations detected via the B2 MS/Line overhead byte or B1
   RS/Section overhead byte and converting the number of violations
   over a time period into the corresponding bit error rate. The
   configured BER threshold is used to determine if the observed BER
   results in a signal failure (SF) or signal degradation (SD)
   condition.

   Note here that LoF, LoS and AIS refer to Inherent path state
   monitoring and BER refers to Inherent and Non-intrusive path state
   monitoring.

                Draft-many-optical-restoration-00.txt   February 2001



   In all-optical networks, LoS (or LoL) is directly applicable to
   optical link failure detection. BER is more complicated to achieve
   in all-optical networks since they include only PXCÆs. Since the BER
   real-time measurement in all-optical networks is currently under
   definition, these considerations are left for further study.

   Note also that the failure detection mechanisms considered in this
   memo are bit rate independent and transparent (to the client
   signal).

3.3 Strict vs. Loose explicit routing

   In CR-LDP [MPLS-CRLDP], both strict explicit routing and loose
   explicit routing mechanisms may be used. However, in this scheme for
   lambda switching within a given IGP area, we only consider strict
   explicit routing to designate the route of the lightpath. By using
   strict explicit routing, optical network resources can be managed
   more precisely, and the rate of success for lightpath creation can
   be enhanced. Consequently, we only consider strict explicit routing
   for intra-area routing.

   For inter-area routing, the knowledge of the topology of the
   neighboring areas depends on the information advertised through the
   IGP protocol (we consider here inter-area summary advertisements as
   described in [MPLS-TE]). So, we assume that the explicit route
   computation and selection is performed at the ingress OXC (default
   behavior) and explicitly at each border OXC. This means that at each
   border OXC (i.e. at the ingress of each sub-network or area), the
   explicit route for the lightpath segment within this area needs to
   be computed (or selected).

3.4 Decision of backup lightpath

   The difference between a primary lightpath and backup lightpath is
   that at the edge of the optical network, the backup lightpath has no
   connections within the optical matrix between the input and the
   output LSC interface of the ingress OXC and egress OXC, whereas the
   primary lightpath has connection in both OXCs. The connections
   between these LSC interfaces are performed during the restoration
   process.

   However, the backup lightpath resources used within the optical
   network could be used to transport best-effort traffic. In this
   case, the edge (ingress and egress) port connections for the backup
   lightpath are assigned to interfaces excluded from those allocated
   to the corresponding restoration group. The corresponding bandwidth
   resource is then considered as available but advertised with a lower
   priority. This is the more efficient way to use the optical network
   resources.

   In our approach of the lightpath restoration, we consider two kinds
   of lightpath restoration schemes: provisioned or non-provisioned.
   Provisioned restoration of lightpaths is also referred to as
   lightpath protection.

   - Either provisioned: meaning that backup lightpaths are established
   in advance of a link failure. The method of pre-establishment of
   backup lightpaths in advance of link failure minimizes the
   restoration time, especially when the restoration process must be
   carried out simultaneously for a large number of damaged lightpaths
   sharing the same damaged link. In order to maximize the use of the
   optical network resources, the wavelengths allocated to the backup
   lightpaths could be used for carrying preemptable best-effort, low-
   priority traffic and this only during failure-free optical network
   operating conditions.

   - Or non-provisioned with a maximum restoration time value: meaning
   that backup lightpaths are dynamically created when a link failure
   is detected or advertised. The maximum restoration time is related
   to the signaling delay needed to create the backup lightpath through
   the optical network. This implies the need to define an ultra fast
   restoration mechanism (we assume here a low latency signalling
   network).

   This non-provisioned approach does not preclude the background pre-
   computing of the backup route for these paths (also referred to as
   non-static routing). However, in this case, some refreshment
   mechanism of the pre-calculated backup routes is needed in order to
   ensure that these routes are still æusableÆ regarding the
   topological and resource information advertised by the IGP protocol.
   The (non-)static vs dynamic route computation is described in
   section 3.4.

3.4.2 Dedicated vs. Shared Restoration

   The following dedicated and shared restoration mechanisms for meshed
   optical networks are considered:
   - Dedicated 1:1 where one primary lightpath shares one backup
   lightpath
   - Group Shared 1:N where N primary lightpaths share one backup
   lightpath (still dedicated to the designated to a unique restoration
   group-N)
   - Group Shared M:N (with N > M and M >= 2) where N primary
   lightpaths share M backup lightpaths (still dedicated to the
   designated to a unique restoration group-N)
   - Multi-group Group Shared 1:N where N primary lightpaths share one
   backup lightpath (here the protection lightpath is shared between P
   restoration group-N)
   - Multi-group Shared M:N (with N > M and M >= 2) where N primary
   lightpaths share M backup lightpaths (here the protection lightpaths
   are shared between P restoration group-N)

                Draft-many-optical-restoration-00.txt   February 2001


   Since 1:1 and 1:N are particular case of the M:N restoration scheme
   we only consider this last case for the seek of generality of this
   draft. The size of N will depend on the topological characteristics
   of the network and the size of M depends on the restoration level
   supported by the optical network. We say that the N primary
   lightpath and M backup lightpath share the same restoration group. A
   given restoration group is identified by a restoration identifier
   defined by the ingress OXC.

   Note that the weakness of the 1:N restoration mechanism is that,
   after an initial failure and before re-provisioning, it cannot
   support restoration for additional failures to other lightpaths in
   the same restoration group. This defect is remedied through the
   general M:N restoration mechanism (M >= 2) which the simultaneous
   restoration of maximum M primary lightpaths.

   To decide on the grouping of primary lightpaths and backup
   lightpaths, the SRLG values of links are considered. Because a
   lightpath travels through several links, it will have corresponding
   to it the set of SRLG values of its member links.

   The lightpaths within a 1:N restoration group cannot share the same
   SRLG value (and subsequently set of SRLG value, since SRLG sets must
   be disjoint), as then a single failure could affect several
   lightpaths simultaneously. Therefore, when a new lightpath is
   created, if it cannot be placed within any existing restoration
   group, a new restoration group is created, along with a backup
   lightpath for the newly created primary lightpath.

   Moreover, since SRLG sets must be completely disjoint more than M
   lightpaths within a M:N restoration group cannot share the same set
   of SRLG values since a single failure could affect more than M
   primary lightpath simultaneously.

3.4 Static vs. Dynamic Routing

   The Optical Restoration Diameter (ORD) defines the Optical
   Restoration Scope (ORS) or domain. Optical Restoration Diameter is
   defined as the number of nodes (i.e. number OXCÆs and PXCÆs) in the
   routing path (i.e. node sequence) for which a given restoration
   mechanism and policy is applied providing the static or dynamic
   routing.

   Regarding the lightpath restoration policy (provisioned or non-
   provisioned) and depending on the restoration diameter, two route
   computation schemes can be considered: static and dynamic routing.

   - Static routing: for every end-to-end lightpath between border OXC,
   the routing path are predetermined through the application of
   Constraint-based SPF (CSPF) algorithm and does not change depending
   on the connection in progress in the network. Different routing
   constraints can be used to compute the routing path for every
   lightpath. Some of these constraints are:

                 Internet Draft û Expires August 2001               11

                Draft-many-optical-restoration-00.txt   February 2001


    . to minimize the transport-plane delay
    . to minimize the signalling delay
    . to minimize the link and wavelength usage
    . to maximize the bandwidth usage
    . to optimize other network performance characteristics
    . to optimize the routing diversity between lightpath belonging to
      the same restoration group

   - Dynamic routing: for any given end-to-end lightpath, the routing
   path to be used is determined when a connection between boundary
   OXCs is requested. Using a dynamic routing scheme, a lightpath is
   not predetermined and depends on the routing path for other
   connection in progress in the network. A dynamic scheme needs a
   setup time (i.e. a maximum restoration time) to determine the
   routing path such that the lightpath satisfies the routing
   constraints (delay, bandwidth and performance). From the link and
   wavelength usage at any instant, the lightpath is constructed
   dynamically. Consequently, the OXCs are not programmed initially and
   set to establish the lightpaths when such requests occurs.

   When using static routing scheme, if faults occur to the nodes,
   links or channels, one or more predetermined lightpaths will become
   unusable. Consequently, since fault occurrence is inherently a
   dynamic network characteristic, achieving fault-tolerance in a
   network using static routing is more difficult than in a network
   using dynamic routing. The failure avoidance mechanism needed with
   static routing as well as specific dynamic routing mechanisms are
   detailed in the remaining document.

3.5 Partial Restoration

   When the ORD does not include any node traversed by a lightpath
   (from the ingress to the egress OXC) but only some partial segment
   of the routing path, then the restoration mechanism applied for this
   lightpath is only partial.

   Consequently, a restoration path has to be provided for each link or
   sequence of links covered by the lightpath and not only from the
   ingress to the egress OXC, source and destination of this lightpath.
   Depending on the routing plan (i.e. static or dynamic), partial
   restoration can be applied for instance per IGP area. In this case,
   the lightpath restoration procedure only applies between ABR
   belonging to the area experiencing the lightpath failure.

   If the lightpath traverse multiple areas, partial restoration can
   independently handle simultaneous recovery of single failure per
   area. At the ABR, in case of simultaneous recovery, the
   synchronization between the ingress and the egress port switching
   connection is guaranteed by the bi-directionality of the lightpath
   restoration process.

   Partial restoration offers the advantage of lightpath failure
   isolation per area (or any other logical structure) as well as a

                 Internet Draft û Expires August 2001               12

                Draft-many-optical-restoration-00.txt   February 2001


   greater flexibility in the backup routing path selection. However,
   the main advantage of partial restoration is that this technique
   enables the partitioning of the restoration domains; this in turn
   limits the probability of simultaneous failures within the mean
   restoration time.

   Partial restoration can also be applied for link failure restoration
   and more generally to node failure. In this case, one could expect
   that each node is capable to compute the lightpath segment of detour
   [IPO-FT] between the upstream and the downstream node adjacent the
   link failure detection. This restoration mechanism is sometimes
   referred to as ôlocal re-routingö.

3.6 Release of damaged lightpath and Restoration Strategies

   Depending on the lightpath restoration strategy, a damaged lightpath
   could be released (non-revertive restoration strategy) or repaired
   (revertive restoration strategy):

   - If we consider a non-revertive strategy, then the damaged
   lightpath must be released in order to make the resources of its
   undamaged segments available for future demands. Since a link
   failure generates a Notification Message in both ingress and egress
   OXC direction, the release of the corresponding lightpath resources
   is by default the ingress OXC's responsibility. However, as
   explained in section 4.3, in order to decrease the restoration time
   from the primary to the backup path, the switching is performed
   'simultaneously' at both ends. The released resources can be reused
   after announcement of the corresponding released status through IGP
   link-state advertisements.

   - If we consider a revertive strategy, then the resources used by
   the damaged lightpaths must not be released in order to be re-used
   when the failed æresourceÆ will be available again. By receiving the
   Notification Message, any OXC included within the route of the
   failed lightpath reserves the corresponding resources. Note that a
   specific time-out could be locally defined to release the resources
   if the failed resource status does not change within a certain
   period of time.

   Note that by referring to MPLS specification [MPLS-ARCH] (and to the
   GMPLS signalling specification [GMPLS-SIG]), a non-revertive
   restoration strategy refers to a liberal (generalized) label
   retention mode and a revertive restoration to a conservative
   (generalized) label retention mode.

3.7 Failure of lightpath creation

   The creation of lightpaths can fail for the following three reasons.
   First, failure can occur due to an inconsistency between the
   gathered link state information at the ingress OXC and the actual
   link status of optical network. Because link state information can


                 Internet Draft û Expires August 2001               13

                Draft-many-optical-restoration-00.txt   February 2001


   be transmitted with some delay from every OXC, delayed updates can
   make for this inconsistency.

   Secondly, failure can occur even if link state information is
   consistent with the actual link status. If two ingress OXCs decide
   simultaneously to use the same network resources, one of the
   lightpath setup attempts will fail because its resources have
   already been claimed by the other lightpath. However, contention
   resolution procedures are described in [GMPLS-SIG] and are not
   further considered within this document.

   Finally, even if lightpath establishment completes, the lightpath
   may fail to carry data because the quality of transmission does not
   reach a minimal threshold level. The deterioration of transmission
   quality can occur due to several reasons as described in [IPO-CTRL]
   and [IPO-LMP].

   The first two cases of failure during lightpath creation are
   reported to the ingress OXC by a Notification Message from the
   intermediate OXCs where the error is detected. Failure can be
   detected by measuring the Optical Signal to Noise Ration (OSNR) of
   the received optical signal or the Bit Error Rate (BER) of Optical-
   to-Electric transformed data. In the all-optical domain, a new BER
   measurement has been proposed in [IPO-OPM], this technique performs
   sequential scanning of the input power of the optical signal after
   splitting (more accurately by using taps). If the quality of the
   optical signal does not reach the threshold level, then the
   lightpath is released, and a new lightpath is created.

4. Restoration Procedures

   In this section, we detail the optical restoration procedures and
   mechanisms. More precisely, we analyze the setup procedures for
   primary and backup lightpaths, the reporting procedure for handling
   damaged lightpaths, the restoration procedure for replacing a
   damaged lightpath with one of the backup lightpaths included within
   the backup group, and the release procedure for unused lightpaths.


4.2 Decision of lightpath route based on link state information

   If a primary lightpath cannot be created within an already existing
   restoration group, then a new restoration group needs to be defined.
   So, the primary lightpath and the corresponding backup lightpath are
   created within the new restoration group defined by a new
   restoration identifier.

   If the primary lightpath can be created within an existing
   restoration group, then if the number of backup lightpath already
   created for this restoration group is less than M then a new backup
   lightpath is created. Otherwise, if the number of backup lightpath
   is greater than M, no new backup lightpath is created. However, if
   the number of established primary lightpath does not exceed the


                 Internet Draft û Expires August 2001               14

                Draft-many-optical-restoration-00.txt   February 2001


   number of existing backup lightpath, no new backup lightpath is
   created.

4.2.1 Lightpath setup procedure for primary lightpath

   Once the route of a lightpath is decided, the ingress OXC sends the
   Lightpath Create Request Message to the next intermediate OXC
   through the control channel. The sequence of intermediate OXCs to be
   followed by the lightpath is included within the explicit route
   field of the Lightpath Create Request Message; and at each OXC the
   wavelength to be allocated for the lightpath is deduced from the
   channel identifier corresponding to this wavelength.

   An intermediate OXC receives the Lightpath Create Request Message
   from its adjacent upstream OXC. The OSCtrl of the intermediate OXC
   then attempts to configure the OXC switch fabric according to the
   Lightpath Create Request Message, and receives the result from the
   OXC switch fabric. If a successful result is returned, the OSCtrl of
   the intermediate OXC sends the Lightpath Create Request Message to
   its downstream intermediate OXC for that route. During this
   procedure, intermediate OXCs consume the optical network resources
   and therefore update the link state database by indicating the
   corresponding resources as reserved meaning that these resources
   won't be allocated to another restoration group. This link state
   information will then be flooded to other OXC by using IGP link-
   state advertisement.

   If a Lightpath Create Request Message successfully reaches the
   egress OXC, the egress OXC then returns the Lightpath Create
   Response Message noting the successful lightpath creation through
   the reverse direction of the Lightpath Create Request Message
   direction to the ingress OXC. Upon receiving this response message,
   each of the OXC updates the link state database by indicating the
   corresponding resources as used. This link state information will
   then be flooded to other OXC through IGP link-state advertisements.

   When the Lightpath Create Response Message reaches the ingress OXC,
   it advertises this increment in available bandwidth capacity by
   flooding link-state IGP routing protocol advertisement at the client
   IP network control-plane level. Routers receiving this link status
   information apply the increased bandwidth to the generation of LSPs
   meeting traffic-engineering requirements [MPLS-LSPH].

   If an intermediate OXC receiving the Lightpath Create Request
   Message cannot successfully configure the OXC switch fabric, the
   intermediate OXC replies with a Notification Message indicating the
   failure to the ingress OXC. At each of the OXC where the Lightpath
   Create Request Message has been successfully proceeded and the
   allocated resources marked as reserved, the corresponding resources
   previously marked as reserved are released and marked as unused in
   the link state database. An ingress OXC receiving this reply then
   sends a Lightpath Create Response Message (to the requesting client)


                 Internet Draft û Expires August 2001               15

                Draft-many-optical-restoration-00.txt   February 2001


   to release any tentatively claimed resources. The detailed procedure
   is explained in section 4.3.

4.2.2 Lightpath setup procedure for backup lightpath

   Backup lightpaths are created through the same procedure as primary
   lightpaths. Depending on the restoration policy defined regarding
   the backup lightpath provisioning, backup lightpath creation is
   triggered either during the primary lightpath setup (provisioned) or
   during the lightpath recovery (non-provisioned).

   The backup lightpaths established by this procedure belong to the
   same restoration group than the primary group of lightpaths to which
   they refers. Each of these lightpaths is also identified by the
   restoration Path_Status field that indicates the status of the
   lightpath within the range [0, M] and the Restoration Path_Type bit
   (= 1) defining it as a backup lightpath.

4.3 Procedure for reporting a damaged lightpath

   Damaged lightpaths can be triggered by detecting a LoL or a LoS
   Alarm on the upstream and/or on the downstream OXC depending on
   failure experienced by the fiber link, the fiber sub-segment and the
   fiber segment connecting the optical device interfaces [IPO-SRLG].

4.3.1 Link Failure Detection

   However, the resulting link failure detection will be one of the
   following:

   - Uni-directional link detection: the failure affects only one fiber
   of the fiber pair; meaning that the LoS is detected by the
   downstream OXC or by the upstream OXC.

   - Bi-directional link detection: the failure affects both fibers of
   a fiber pair; meaning that the LoS is detected by the downstream and
   by the upstream OXC.

   In a end-to-end (or partial) restoration, by receiving the alarm
   signal, the OXC issues a Notification Message translating this
   physical network failure. The Notification Message comprises the
   Lightpath ID, the Restoration Group ID and the Restoration
   Path_Status of the damaged primary or backup lightpath. The
   Notification Message may optionally include the detailed the reason
   why the impairment occurred.

               Fig 4. Bi-directional Link Failure Detection


   To detect a unidirectional link failure the following mechanism is
   proposed: by detecting a LoS Alarm, the OXC generates a Notification
   in both the downstream and upstream direction of the damaged
   lightpath. If the upstream (or the downstream) OXC has also detected
   the LoS Alarm (i.e. bi-directional link failure detection), then it
   sends back a Notification Message to the downstream (or upstream)
   OXC. Otherwise (i.e. unidirectional link failure detection) the
   upstream (or the downstream) OXC forward the Notification toward the
   ingress (or the egress) OXC.

                Draft-many-optical-restoration-00.txt   February 2001


   Depending on restoration mechanism supported within a given ORD:
   - Either the OXCs detecting the failure restore the corresponding
   damaged lightpaths; in that case the restoration procedure is
   referred to as link restoration (as described in section 3.1). If
   the link restoration mechanism does not recover the lightpath after
   the expiration restoration time-out then the notification message is
   forwarded until reaching the ingress (or the egress) OXC.
   - Or if these OXCs does not support (or are not allowed by their
   restoration policy restriction) to perform link restoration; in that
   case the notification message is directly sent to the ingress (or
   egress) OXC who will apply the restoration procedure(s) described in
   section 4.4.

4.3.2 Notification Mechanism

   The need for an upstream and downstream Notification depends on:
   - the restoration policy (end-to-end or partial including link
   restoration) applied within a given ORD
   - the local re-routing of all the damaged lightpaths is unsuccessful
   - the node B and/or C which might not be capable to detect a LoL

   Specific timers and thresholds are introduced in order to ensure the
   proper operation of the restoration mechanism. The following timers
   and thresholds are defined for that purpose:

   - Notification Timer (NTR): when an OXC detects a failure, this
   timer defines the waiting period before sending a notification
   message. For instance, in the previous example (see Figure 3), if
   NRT = 0 then T1 û T0 = 0.

   - Forwarding Timer (FTR): when an OXC receive a notification
   message, this timer defines the waiting period before forwarding the
   notification message to the upstream or the downstream OXC. A
   notification timer of 0 means that the notification messages must be
   directly sent to the upstream or downstream next OXC. For instance,
   in the previous example (see Figure 3), if FTR = 0 then T1 û T2 = 0.

   - Restoration Timer (RTR): when an OXC detects a failure, this timer
   (also referred to as restoration time-out) defines the period during
   which the OXC can execute the local restoration procedure (as
   specified in the next section). A restoration timer value equal to 0
   means that the OXC does not have the capability to perform the local
   path re-routing so that the corresponding forwarding timer equals to
   0. For instance, in the previous example (see Figure 3), if RTR = 0
   then T1 - T2 = 0 since it implies that FTR must be equal to 0.

4.3.3 Reliable Notification Mechanism

   In order to provide a reliable notification mechanism, a
   Notification Counter (RCR) can be additionally defined. This counter
   provides the required retransmission capabilities in case of
   Notification Message loss and the continuous notification of the
   failure until this failure has been repaired (see section 4.4.1).

   The continuous notification mechanism is regulated by a exponential
   back-off algorithm: T[n] = 2 x k x T[n-1] =< RTR with T[0] = 1 and k
   =< 1.

   However, reliability of the notification mechanism can be also
   achieved by extending the (CR-)LDP fault tolerant (FT) enhancements
   [MPLS-LDPFT]. This mechanism allows nodes to negotiate how long they
   will retain FT states such as learned (generalized) label bindings
   after the lightpath failure occurs as well as the corresponding
   damaged links but also after the potential failure of the (CR-)LDP
   session occurs (for signalling plane fault-tolerance purpose).
   Consequently, when sending the notification message, the OXC (i.e.
   the one who has detected the failure) is waiting for the
   acknowledgement of this notification message by the receiver. The
   receiver is defined as the OXC that takes the failure recovery
   procedure into consideration and applies the lightpath restoration
   procedure as described in section 4.4.

   The definition of a reliable notification mechanism allows the OXC
   to negotiate how long they will remember pre-failure switching state
   after experiencing a link failure.

4.4 Lightpath Restoration procedure

   Restoration procedure can be applied to a damaged primary lightpath
   or backup lightpath.

4.4.1 Restoration procedure for single damaged primary lightpath

   In case of failure of a primary lightpath, the (ingress) OXC is made
   aware of which lightpath is damaged by the Lightpath ID, the
   Restoration Group ID and the Restoration Path_Status field included
   within the Notification Message. The localization of the failure is
   inferred from the link ID (or the bundle ID) included in the
   notification message.

   - If the provisioned restoration policy has been previously
   configured for this restoration group, the ingress OXC then replaces
   the damaged primary lightpath with of the backup lightpath shared by
   the same restoration group. With M:N restoration, the backup
   lightpath Path_Status corresponds to the value of N (if this value
   of M exist).

   - If the provisioned restoration policy has not been previously
   configured for this restoration group, then the ingress OXC
   initiates a lightpath create procedure for the backup lightpath, as
   described in section 4.2.2. Note that since the route computation
   for backup lightpath has been determined prior to the primary
   lightpath failure, the maximum restoration time depends here only on
   the signaling delay.

   When provisioned restoration policy is defined, if the physical
   resource failure affect also the one computed for the backup

                 Internet Draft û Expires August 2001               19

                Draft-many-optical-restoration-00.txt   February 2001


   lightpath, the restoration policy is automatically switched to the
   one executed for the non-provisioned case.

   When receiving the failure Notification Message, the ingress OSCtrl
   reconfigure the connection within the OXC switch by switching the
   connection between the incoming and the outgoing lambda port of the
   damaged lightpath with that of the backup lightpath. This process is
   executed internally without exchanging messages but not activated.
   Then, the ingress OSCtrl reflects the result in the Notification
   Message it sends to the egress OSCtrl.

   Since the failure Notification Message is sent simultaneously from
   the OXC detecting the failure to the ingress and the egress OXC,
   this Notification Message is also received by the egress OXCs. This
   in order to enable the egress OSCtrl to find the outgoing LSC
   interface for the damaged lightpath. The OSCtrl converts this
   message into an internal control command it sends to the OXC switch
   to enable the connection between the incoming and outgoing lambda
   port in the OXC switch fabric. The OXC switch returns a result
   status to the OSCtrl. Then, the egress OSCtrl reflects the result in
   the Notification Message it sends to the ingress OSCtrl.

   When the ingress (egress) OSCtrl receives the Notification message
   sent by the egress (ingress) OSCtrl, corresponding to the lightpath
   failure, both OXC activate the backup connection.

   Since one of the backup lightpath is consumed (or created depending
   on the restoration policy) by this restoration procedure, a new
   alternative backup lightpath must be created. This procedure is
   carried out according to the procedure of section 4.2.2. As we
   consider the Restoration Path_Status of each of the backup
   lightpath, this procedure must take into account the Path_Status
   value of the consumed lightpath.

4.4.2 Restoration procedure for multiple damaged lightpaths

   The previous section describes the basic restoration procedure for
   multiple damaged lightpath. Depending on the restoration policy, the
   following alternative is considered:

   - Provisioned restoration: in order to decrease the number of
   notification messages sent by the OXC detecting the failure, we
   consider a unique Notification Message including the Lightpath ID
   and Path_Status value of each of the damaged lightpath belonging to
   the same Restoration Group ID. At the ingress OXC, if the number of
   provisioned backup is not sufficient, then additional backup
   lightpath can be created as described in section 4.2.2. However, the
   egress OXC never initiates a backup Lightpath Create Request Message
   even if the number of backup lightpath is not sufficient to restore
   a sufficient number of damaged primary lightpaths.

   - Non-provisioned restoration: the same notification mechanism as
   the one described for provisioned restoration is used. However, only

                Draft-many-optical-restoration-00.txt   February 2001


   the ingress OXC initiates a backup Lightpath Create Request Message
   in order to restore the damaged primary lightpaths.

4.4.3 Restoration procedure for damaged backup lightpath

   In case of failure of a backup lightpath, the ingress OXC must be
   aware which lightpath is damaged by referring to the Lightpath ID,
   the Restoration Group ID and Restoration Path_Status of the backup
   lightpath.

   The damage of a backup lightpath must not affect to the ongoing data
   transfer.  However, since the primary lightpaths belonging to the
   same restoration group lose the restoration capability, an
   alternative backup lightpath must be created when a backup lightpath
   failure is detected. The procedure for creating alternative backup
   lightpath is executed according to the procedure of section 4.2.2.

4.4.4 Restoration procedure for damage primary and backup lightpaths

   It is possible that a combination of failures will affect primary
   and backup lightpaths in a restoration group. In general, in an M:N
   restoration group, a set of failures can occur so that N' primary
   lightpaths and M' backup lightpaths are disabled. If the number of
   remaining backup lightpaths M - M' is less than the number of
   affected primary lightpaths N', then it will not be possible for the
   network to restore service to all the affected primary lightpaths by
   using the standard restoration procedure described in the preceding
   sections.

   In such a situation, the network should attempt to provide automatic
   restoration services to as many affected primary lightpaths as
   possible. If different priority (i.e. precedence) levels are
   assigned to the various primary lightpaths in the restoration group,
   those affected lightpaths with the highest priority will have their
   traffic routed onto the remaining backup lightpaths. Once all the
   highest-priority affected lightpaths have been served, the network
   will then attempt to provide backup lightpaths for the set of
   affected lightpaths that have the next highest precedence level.
   This process will continue until the supply of unaffected backup
   lightpaths has been exhausted. If all the affected lightpaths have
   the same priority level or if priority levels are not being used,
   backup paths will be activated for them on a first come, first
   served basis (FIFO-like service).

   For the remaining N' - M + M' lightpaths that do not have backup
   lightpaths available, the network will attempt to create backup
   lightpaths on the fly using the procedure in Section 4.2.2. It will
   do this by precedence level or on a first come, first served basis
   until all N' affect primary lightpaths have been served or until M
   backup lightpaths have been used. After the restoration procedures
   have been completed, the network will create N new backup
   lightpaths, as described in Section 4.4.1, for the restoration
   group.

4.5 Lightpath release procedure


4.5.1 Release procedure with non-revertive restoration policy

   The release of a lightpath can take place for several reasons:
   (1) the primary or backup lightpath becoming impaired by the damage
   (2) the backup lightpath becoming unneeded due to the release of a
   sufficient number of primary lightpaths belonging to the same
   restoration group
   (3) the primary or backup lightpath not further processed due to the
   occurrence of an non-recoverable error during the lightpath creation
   procedure
   (4) the preemption by a lightpath with a higher precedence when the
   preempting lightpath is unable to obtain free network resources to
   be created (this case include the blocking probability recovery)
   (5) the primary lightpath becoming under-utilized due to a decreased
   volume of the data traffic (in a data-driven approach only and not
   considered in this memo since the procedure associated to such an
   event is a lightpath modification procedure)

   A Lightpath Delete Request Message is sent from the ingress OXC to
   the egress OXC or to an intermediate OXC by passing through the
   intermediate OXCs comprising the target lightpath that experience a
   failure. For this process, the Lightpath Delete Request Message
   includes the identifier of the damaged lightpath (which stands for
   the explicit route) in order to determine at each the sequence of
   intermediate OXCs that this message need to follow.

   When an intermediate OXC receives the Lightpath Delete Request
   Message from its upstream OXC, its OSCtrl attempts to configure the
   OXC switch fabric according to the Lightpath Delete Request Message
   content, and wait to receive the result from the OXC switch. If a
   successful result is returned, the OSCtrl of the intermediate OXC
   transmits the Lightpath Delete Request Message to the next
   downstream intermediate OXC. During this procedure, intermediate
   OXCs release the optical network resources and then update their
   link state database by marking the corresponding resources as
   reserved.

   If the Lightpath Delete Request Message successfully proceeds all
   the way to the egress OXC, the latter notifies the result of the
   delete request by generating a Lightpath Delete Response Message
   back to the ingress OXC. By receiving this message, intermediate
   OXCs update their link state database by marking the optical network
   resources as unused. This link state information will be then
   flooded through usual OSPF/IS-IS link-state advertisement.

   If the intermediate OXC receiving the Lightpath Delete Request (or
   Response) Message fails to commit the release in the OXC switch
   fabric, an error message is returned to the OSCtrl and subsequently
   propagated back using a Notification Message.

4.5.2 Maintenance procedure with revertive restoration policy

   If we consider a revertive approach, then the resource used by the
   damaged lightpath must not be released in order to be re-used when
   the failed æresourceÆ will be available again. More precisely, the
   non-release procedure is a standby maintenance procedure since the
   resources can not be used either by the damaged primary lightpath or
   by any another lightpath. Note here that we assume that the
   notification message generated during the failure detection has
   already trigger usage of a backup lightpath between the ingress and
   the egress OXC.

   By receiving the Notification Message sent by any OXC included
   within the route of the failed lightpath indicates the corresponding
   resources as reserved (i.e. locked) within the local link state
   database. The sub-sequent unlock process of the resources reserved
   for this lightpath depends on following alternative:

   - if the failure is not recovered at expiration of the restoration
   time-out, then the OXC(s) still experiencing the damage sends a last
   Notification Message; and as described for the non-revertive
   approach, the ingress OXC initiates a primary lightpath deletion
   procedure;

   - if the failure is recovered prior to the expiration of the
   restoration time-out, then by reaching the ingress OXC, the last
   Notification Message initiates a Lightpath Create Request Message
   whose effect is to unlock the resources reserved for the ærestoredÆ
   lightpath. When both end of the restored lightpath are synchronized
   (i.e. the ingress OXC received the Lightpath Create Response Message
   back from the egress OXC) the switching from the backup to the
   primary lightpath can occur.

5.  Signaling Extensions

   In this section, we define the message types that are used for the
   bandwidth provisioning and restoration procedures. These message
   types and their corresponding can be further defined and included
   within optical CR-LDP (and within optical RSVP extensions) signaling
   extensions.

5.1 Lightpath Create Request Message

   A Lightpath Create Request Message is issued to create a primary
   lightpath or backup lightpath by an ingress OXC. As defined in
   [MPLS-CRLDP] and generalized in [GMPLS-CRLDP], the explicit route
   field of the Label Request Message (i.e. the Lightpath Create
   Request Message) specifies the path to be taken by the lightpath
   being established.

   The Label Request Message must include additionally to the
   parameters already defined, the following specific information

   The Restoration TLV (optional) which could include the following
   information:

   - Restoration Group ID: 48-bit field identifying the restoration
   group to which the lightpath belongs. The Restoration Group ID is
   defined is a unique identifier of a Restoration Group defined within
   a GMPLS network. The Restoration Group ID is defined as been
   composed by the following fields:
   - the ingress LSR Router ID (i.e ingress OXC ID) or any of its own
   IPv4 addresses
   - a locally unique Group ID (16-bit) to that LSR
   - a locally unique P integer (8-bit) specifying the number
   restoration Group IDs sharing the backup LSPs, to that LSR

   The Restoration Group ID TLV format is defined as:

   The ActFlg is a 4-bit field that indicates explicitly the action
   that should be taken if the Restoration Group already exists on the
   LSR receiving the message. The ActFlg value must be set to 0001
   (modify LSP indication) except when a new Restoration Group has to
   be created.

   - Restoration Path_Type: 1-bit field (T bit) enabling the
   distinction between a primary and backup lightpath is defined

   Restoration Path_Type bit equals to 0 the lightpath is defined as a
   primary path and when it equals to 1 the lightpath is defined as a
   backup path.

   - Restoration Path_Status: for primary path this 15-bit integer
   assigned by the ingress OXC takes a value within the range [0, N]
   with N < 32767 and for backup path this integer takes a value within
   the range [0, M] with M < N.

   restoration group to which it refers. In [MPLS-CRLDP], the
   corresponding Preemption TLV is format is:

  Note that the default value of the setup and holding priorities
  should be in the middle of the range (e.g., 4).

   - Restoration Policy: this optional parameter (8-bit field) includes
     . the restoration strategy bit: revertive (R bit = 0) or non-
     revertive (R bit = 1)
     . the restoration scheme bit: provisioned (P bit = 0) or non-
     provisioned (P bit = 1)
     . the restoration diameter bit: partial restoration (D bit = 0) or
     end-to-end restoration (D bit = 1)

   When the non-provisioned policy is selected, an additional parameter
   referred to as the maximum restoration time can be considered. This
   parameter enable to determine a æpre-selectedÆ route for the backup
   lightpaths whose signaling delay is less than the maximum
   restoration time.

   The restoration policy parameter values should be the same for all
   the lightpath belonging to the same restoration group.

5.2 Lightpath Create Response message

   This message is used as the response message for the Lightpath
   Create Request Message. As described in [MPLS-CRLDP] and generalized
   in [GMPLS-CRLDP], an ingress OXC identifies a Label Mapping Message
   (i.e. Lightpath Create Response Message) respectively by comparing
   the Message ID conveyed by a Label Request Message (i.e. Lightpath
   Create Request Message) with the Message ID that was issued by
   itself.

   The Label Mapping Message must include additionally to the
   parameters already defined, the specific information defined within
   the Restoration TLV (optional); which could include the specific
   information within the Result Code TLV.

5.3 Notification Message

   The lightpath restoration procedures imply the definition of an
   additional Notification Message type. This Notification Message must
   include the Lightpath ID (i.e. LSPID TLV - see section 5.3.2) as
   well as the Status of the corresponding lightpath (or the list of
   lightpaths).

   The Status of the lightpath must include the current status of the
   lightpath (active, inactive, reserved, failed) as well as optionally
   the alarm detection such as a LoL, LoS, BER, OSNR, etc. resulting
   from the physical network damage or failure.

5.3.1 Notification Message format

   As defined in [MPLS-LDP], an OXC sends a Notification Message to
   inform an OXC peer of significant event. A Notification Message
   signals a fatal error or provides advisory information such as the
   outcome of processing a CR-LDP message or the state of the LDP
   session.

   Here, to distinguish between Notification Message sent in response
   to a Label Request Message and Unsolicited Notification Message, we
   define an Unsolicited Notification Message type. Consequently, to
   inform an OXC peer of significant event within the transport plane,
   an OXC sends an Unsolicited Notification Message.

   The encoding for the Unsolicited Notification Message is:

      Status TLV
        Indicates the event being signaled.  The encoding for the
        Status TLV is specified in Section "Status TLV" of [MPLS-LDP].

        The Status Code included in the Status TLV must have the fatal
        error E bit = 0 (advisory notification) except if a fatal error
        is notified E bit = 1 (fatal error). If the Notification
        Message need to be forwarded the forward F bit = 1, otherwise F
        bit = 0. The latter case applies only for unidirectional link
        failure restoration procedure.

      Optional Parameters
        This variable length field contains 0 or more parameters, each
        encoded as a TLV. For the purpose of this memo, only the
        Extended Status TLV (type 0x0301 û length 32-bit) will appear
        in Notification Messages.

5.3.2 Notification Message Parameters

   For the notification messages, the additional parameters defined for
   lightpath restoration purposes are:

   - Lightpath ID: which corresponds to the LSPID TLV defined in [MPLS-
   CR-LDP]

   This identifier is mandatory and corresponds to the 48-bit value of
   the optical network identifier defining the lightpath. The Lightpath
   ID corresponds to the LSPID defined in [MPLS-CRLDP] which is a
   unique identifier of a Constraint-based LSP defined within a GMPLS
   network. The LSPID is defined as been composed by the ingress LSR
   Router ID (or any of its own IPv4 addresses) and a locally unique
   LSPID (16-bit) to that LSR. So, we define the Lightpath ID as been
   composed by the node ID of the source OXC and a locally unique
   identifier to that OXC.

       0                   1                   2                   3

   The ActFlg is a 4-bit field that indicates explicitly the action
   that should be taken if the LSP already exists on the LSR receiving
   the message. The ActFlg value must be set to 0001 (modify LSP
   indication).

   - Link ID (or Bundle ID): 32-bit integer identifying the link (or
   the bundle) that experiences a failure. The Link (or the bundle) can
   be numbered or unnumbered. A list of Link IDs is needed in order to
   notify multiple simultaneous failures. Consequently, the format of
   the Link TLV includes at least one Link ID:

       0                   1                   2                     3

       Message
     . Reserved Connection Status defines a Reservation Notification
       Message
     . Suspend Connection Status defines a Suspend Notification Message
     . Failed Connection Status defines a Failure Notification Message

   The optional Extended Status only refers to the Failed Connection
   Status Code. The Extended Status are defined as follows:
   - LoL: Loss of Light detected
   - LoS: Loss of Signal detected
   - BER: BER Threshold exceeded
   - OSNR: OSNR Threshold exceeded
   - Jitter: Jitter Threshold exceeded

   Consequently, the encoding of the Unsolicited Notification Message

5.3.3 Fault Tolerant Notification Message

   As described in section 4.3.3, a Fault Tolerant (FT) Notification
   mechanism can be extended to implement a reliable notification
   procedure after the lightpath failure has been detected.

   As described in [MPLS-LDPFT], the corresponding FT Protection TLV is
   optional and is included only if Reliable Notification as defined in
   Section 4.3.3 is being negotiated during the FT CR-LDP session
   establishment. If reliable transportûplane notification is desired,
   FT status must be negotiated by the participants in the CR-LDP
   session during the exchange of LDP Initialization Messages.

   These messages must contain the FT Session TLV as defined in [MPLS-
   LDPFT], which is also used to negotiate the amount of time that a
   node will maintain state for FT resources and labels in the event of
   LDP session failure. The new FT Path Protection TLV message format
   is defined as:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |0|0| FT Path Protection (TBD)  |      Length (= 4)             |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                      FT Sequence Number                       |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

        FT Sequence Number:
         32 bit unsigned integer that uniquely identifies each message
         in a CR-LDP session between two nodes. The sequence number is
         initialized to 0x00000001 when the CR-LDP session is created
         at FT status is negotiated.  It increments by 1 when a new
         notification message is transmitted, and wraps from 0xFFFFFFF
         to 0x00000000.

   If an LSR transmits a Fault Notification message using a FT CR-LDP
   session and does not receive an acknowledgment from the target node
   within the time allocated by the NCR, it will retransmit the
   message, without incrementing the FT Sequence Number, using the
   continuous notification mechanism defined in Section 4.3.2.

                Draft-many-optical-restoration-00.txt   February 2001


   While [MPS-LDPFT] does not require FT ACKs to be sent immediately,
   they should be sent as soon as possible in response to Failure
   Notification Messages by the LSR recovering the LSP failure. The
   corresponding FT ACK TLV message format is defined as:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |0|0|      FT ACK (TBD)         |      Length (= 4)             |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                      FT ACK Sequence Number                   |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

        ACK Sequence Number:
         32 bit unsigned integer that identifies the most recent FT
         Protection Sequence Number that was received by the sending
         node in the LDP session, as defined in [MPLS-LDPFT].  The ACK
         Sequence Number is cumulative, e.g. a value of 0x0000000F
         indicates that the first 15 messages in the session have been
         successfully received.

   Consequently, the updated Unsolicited Notification Message with
   Reliable Notification encoding is defined as:

       0                   1                   2                   3
