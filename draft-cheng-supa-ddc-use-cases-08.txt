              Use Case for Distributed Data Center in SUPA
                   draft-cheng-supa-ddc-use-cases-08

Abstract

   Large scale Distributed Data Centers (DDCs) can provide various
   services and usually consist of numbers of internal and external
   links where various VPNs are built upon.  The Service provisioning
   and network connectivity configurations could be complex and dynamic,
   and manual configuration is onerous and error-prone.  This draft
   analyzes the use cases in DDCs, in which some VPN scenarios are
   covered, and the applicability of Simplified Use of Policy
   Abstractions (SUPA) data models which can be used for better and
   automated resource usage and easy service/network deployment/
   configuration.

1.  Introduction

   The SUPA (Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions) work aims at
   providing data models, including network service data models, policy
   data models, to easily, accurately, and efficiently select and use
   the available communication network capabilities.  An example of the
   data model can be found in
   [I-D.zaalouk-supa-vpn-service-management-model].  Service Manager
   (SM) is used by an a communications service provider and/or operator
   to deploy and manage services on top of network facilities.  An
   example of SM is a set of applications used by an Operational Support
   System (OSS) entity to perform network configuration.  Several SUPA

Internet-Draft   Use cases for DDC Applications in SUPA        June 2015


   use cases have been introduced in the problem statement document.
   This document reviews various scenarios for Distributed Data Center
   (DDC) use case.

   A large-scale Distributed Data Center (DDC) operator may have to
   maintain multiple data centers and the inter-connecting networks in
   order to provide server hosting, leased line, and value-added
   services to enterprises and ISPs, and have multiple data centers.  In
   this DDC network, traffic at each site is routed via configuring
   policy routes and the operator may be able to adjust routes
   prioritization to choose an outgoing link.  This type of static
   provisioning comes with high costs and poor operability&#65292;and as
   a result the bandwidth resources intra/inter-data centers are not
   efficiently utilized.

   In quite a few scenarios, the links between DCs are VPNs (MPLS, SSL,
   IPsec, and etc.).  SUPA will be mainly used for those VPN
   configurations.  Although there may be some cases where physical
   links are used, but those are out of the scope of this draft.

   DC and network may belong to different operators.  If a DC operator
   needs to configure network connectivity for DCs, it may need to
   cooperate with network operators providing such connectivity.
   Network operators can define and provide data models to enable this.

   This document illustrates several distributed datacenter (DDC)
   applications and explains how an operator could use SUPA to provide
   these applications.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   The terminology used in the SUPA problem statement draft
   [I-D.zhou-supa-framework] and

4.  Challenges Faced by Data Center ISPs

   There are many challenges in traditional DDCs:

   1.  The infrastructure and network links rent from other operators,
       are normally dependent on manual planning and design, which leads
       to inflexibility and low efficiency of resource usages.  SUPA can
       benefit the DDC operators to manage the network resources rent
       from others in a more flexible way.

   2.  Service expansion is limited in a single physical DC.  Each DC
       resource is isolated, so service and resource can only be
       deployed in one single DC.

   3.  VAS (Value Added Service) is provisioned via static
       configuration, which brings complex training, long service TTM
       time and poor flexibility.  This could not meet the requirements
       of complex use cases, e.g., lot of VAS devices, significant
       differences between various services.

5.  SUPA Benefits

   There are requirements from DDC operators to optimize and automate
   the service deployment.  Also, a tenant may expect the traffic
   steering capabilities in order to use the rent links more
   efficiently.  SUPA can show its advantages in above cases since it is
   able to:

   o  Support an open network architecture: standardizaed data models
      enable an open architecture and make it possible for unified
      service / network planning, which can interconnect with third
      party cloud platform, supporting fast service innovation.

Internet-Draft   Use cases for DDC Applications in SUPA        June 2015


   o  Support overall DC resource integration: SUPA data models can be
      used for network resource virtualization; inter-DC resource,
      virtual DC (vDC) resource, etc, can be integrated and controlled
      by a centralized functional entity.

   o  Support automatic E2E service delivery: Network (including virtual
      network), computing, inter-DC management of storage resource,
      automatic service delivery, automatic VPN connection
      configurations between DCs, which improves operation efficiency.

   o  Improve DDC network usage by means of Intelligent scheduling of
      DDC traffic, improving link usage.

   o  Support VAS service on-demand provisioning automatically: Create
      or delete VAS nodes on-demand, based on various service
      requirements; network forwarding policy based on the VAS routing,
      to achieve automatic draining and automatic configuration of VAS
      device policy.

   Please refer to [I-D.zhou-supa-framework] and other SUPA related
   documents for more details of SUPA features.

   The following sections will illustrate three typical cases in
   distributed data center which could benefit from SUPA architecture.

6.  Scenarios

   In the following uses, Service Manager (SM) is used for service and
   policy definition; and Network Manager (Controller) is used for
   network topology maintenance and mapping data models to detail
   network configurations, as defined in [I-D.zhou-supa-framework].

                           Inter DC Connectivity

   There can be a number of links between data centers, and the
   configuration of such links could complex.  As shown in Figure 1,
   service data models and policy data models can be defined to automate
   the configuration procedures.  The service data model for
   connectivity is used for specifying attributes of (virtual) links,
   e.g. the end points of links, bandwidth, QoS and availability
   parameters, etc.  The policy model can specify some high level
   requirements to the links, like routing strategy (via and not via)
   and price/cost strategy.  The policy data model can also define the
   policy rules that drive the security requirements.

   An application example is, the links interconnecting two DCs together
   should guarantee a minimum bandwidth, certain QoS parameters, and
   provide availability guarantees.

   Anothe service policy example in Figure 1, for traffic from DC2 to
   DC-B, if the load on a link exceeds a threshold (e.g., 90%), some
   (new) traffic can be redirect to another link.

   Requirements and configurations derived from above application
   scenarios can be described by service data model and policy data
   model.

               Service Data Model for Inter DC Connectivity

   The above service data model can be used to describe links attributes
   for a VPN, including bandwidth , latency, etc.

                           ECA Policy Data Model

   The above policy data model can be used to describe the requirement
   that when the load on a link exceed a threashold.  In this case,

               Policy Data Model for high level requirements

   The policy model shown above can be used to express some
   sophisticated requirements, e.g. the number of hop of any link should
   be less than 5, or any links should not share any network nodes in
   between and should be completely independent to each other so as to
   achieve high availablity in case of network node failure.

   Inter DC connections can be classified into two types: connections
   within a single administrative domain and connections across multiple
   administrative domains.  Links d1, d2 and d3 are within an
   administrative domain; and links a1, a2 and 3 are across domains.
   The difference between them is that connections across multiple
   administrative domain require extra negotiation and authentication/
   authorization, which can be achieved via communications between SMs.
   Data models for this purpose should also be defined.

                             vDC Connectivity

   A DC tenant may have resources, e.g. network, computing, storage,
   etc, in multiple physical DCs.  DC operators will provide internal
   network connectivity for these distributed resources, and make it

   look like one seamless entity, which can be called as virtual DC
   (vDC).

   The internal links for vDC can be implemented via tunneling overlay
   technologies, e.g.  VPN or VxLAN, etc.  The tunnels need to be
   dynamically established, managed and released.

   As show in Figure 5, service data model and policy data model can be
   defined to automate the links configuration for vDCs.  A service data
   model should specify the attributes of the tunnels, e.g., bandwidth,
   QoS and availability parameters.  Policy systems can dynamically
   scale the DC resources assigned to a tenant, and the policy rules
   that drive the prioritization of resource assignments.  The
   networking resources assigned to a tenant should scale proportionally
   to the compute resources assigned to a tenant.  The traffic should be
   prioritized to resources owned by tenants that offer interactive
   services according to the time zone the DC is located in.  Because a
   DC serving enterprise may require higher priority in working hour,
   and a DC providing entertainment service may need higher network
   priority in non-working hours.

   Static and over provisioning for DC links is not always a good
   solution.  Sometimes dynamic configuration is necessary.

                     Dynamic Link Configuration for DC

   One case is virtual machine migration and large amount of data
   transfer between DCs.  But this kind of activity does not happen
   frequently.  A dedicated link with constant bandwidth for this
   purpose is too expensive.  The network operator should allow the DC
   operator to create a link on demand when necessary.  This link may

   have large bandwidth but last for a limited time period.  An
   alternative is to create short-term dedicated links for backups and
   migrations.

   As shown in Figure 7, data models can help to automate these kind of
   configurations.  In the data models, the attributes of links
   (bandwidth, QoS and availability parameters) should be specified.
   The policy concerning strict and soft bounds on the lifetime of such
   links, and the policy concerning the scheduling of dedicated links
   (e.g., based on the current load) and the services using the
   dedicated links can also be specified.

   When the traffic volume between DCs exceeds a certain threshold, the
   policy-driven service manager requests that traffic schedules may be
   adjusted within bounds in order to balance load on the links (e.g.,
   delay backups and migrations until the network has the necessary
   capacity).

   In this case, the ECA policy model will apply, but the action is
   different -- change the bandwidth of link(s) with time period
   constraints, as shown in Figure6.

                          VPC to DC Connectivity

   In practice, a public cloud operator can virtualize its cloud
   resources into different isolated virtualized private clouds and
   provided them for different tenants.  Such a virtualized private
   cloud is referred to as a VPC.  In a typical VPC provided by, e.g.,
   Alibaba or Amazon, through the control portal, a tenant can establish
   and manage its network easily, for instance, deploying or removing
   virtualized network devices (e.g., virtualized routers and
   virtualized switches), adjusting the topology of VPC
   networks,specifying packet forwarding policies, and deploying or un-
   deploying virtual services (e.g., load balancers, firewalls,
   databases, DNS, etc.).  The network functionalities that the tenant
   can accessed are virtualized and actually performed by the VMs



Cheng, et al.           Expires December 6, 2015               [Page 13]

   located on the servers connected through physical or overlay
   networks.  Note that the servers may be located in different data
   centers which are geographically distributed.

   The manipulation of the virtualized VPC network may also affect the
   configuration of physical networks.  For instance, when a tenant
   newly deploys two VMs in its VPC which are located in different DCs,
   the VPC control mechanism may have to generate a VPN between two DCs
   for the internal VPC communication.  Therefore, the control mechanism
   for a VPC should be able to adjust the underlying network when a
   tenant changes the network or service deployment of the virtual VPC
   network.

   In many cases, a tenant may need to specify how the VPCs is connected
   to its enterprise cloud networks.  For instance, a tenant may want to
   deploy multiple VPNs to connect the VPC with its private cloud
   networks and specify the policies to steer the traffics through
   different VPNs in different conditions.  Note that the VPCs that the
   tenant may be located in different geographic regions, and the VPNs
   to those VPCs may need to be generated at run time.

   In addition, a VPC, often provides other value added services (e.g.,
   database Services, DNS) for VMs in certain VPCs.  The VMs and the
   value added services could be located in different DCs, or even
   provided by different vendors.  VPNs are configured for the VPCs to
   provide connection to the internal services, and to create and manage
   VPNs to internal services.  The access of VMs to data resources
   should be controlled.  For instance, the VMs in a VPC can access the
   database services only when the tenant has deployed database into its
   VPC through the control portal.

   As shown in figure 4, service data models and policy data models can
   be defined to automate the configurations of links between VPC and DC
   where service is located.  The data models should specify the policy
   controlling authentication and authorization concerning access to
   data residing in internal services.

7.  Security Considerations

   Security is a key aspect of any protocol that allows state
   installation and extracting of detailed configuration states.  More
   investigation remains to fully define the security requirements, such
   as authorization and authentication levels.
