Internet-Draft                   PIM MIB                       July 2005


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the
   Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) protocols (PIM-SM [I-D.ietf-pim-
   sm-v2-new] and BIDIR-PIM [I-D.ietf-pim-bidir]).

   This document obsoletes RFC 2934 [RFC2934].  RFC 2934 defined an
   experimental MIB module for managing the PIM protocols.  The MIB
   module defined by this document is a complete re-working of the MIB
   module from RFC 2934, with major changes that include the following.

   o  This MIB module is independent of IP version, whereas RFC 2934
      only supported IPv4.

   o  This MIB module includes support for managing BIDIR-PIM.

   o  This MIB module does not include support for managing PIM-DM.

   o  This MIB module does not include support for managing PIM-SM v1.

   o  This MIB module does not depend on the IPv4 Multicast Routing MIB
      defined in RFC 2932 [RFC2932].

   o  This MIB module includes support for configuring SSM ranges and
      static RPs.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Overview

   This MIB module contains the following tables.

   1.   The PIM Interface Table, which contains one row per IP version
        for each interface of the router which is running PIM.

   2.   The PIM Neighbor Table, which contains one row for each of the
        router's PIM neighbors.

   3.   The PIM Neighbor Secondary Address Table, which contains one row
        for each secondary address advertised by each of the router's
        PIM neighbors.

   4.   The PIM (*,G) State Table, which contains one row for each group
        for which PIM has (*,G) state.

   5.   The PIM (*,G,I) State Table, which contains one row for each
        group and interface for which PIM has interface-specific (*,G)
        state.

   6.   The PIM (S,G) State Table, which contains one row for each
        source and group for which PIM has (S,G) state.

   7.   The PIM (S,G,I) State Table, which contains one row for each
        source, group and interface for which PIM has interface-specific
        (S,G) state.

   8.   The PIM (S,G,rpt) State Table, which contains one row for each
        source and group for which PIM has (S,G,rpt) state.

   9.   The PIM (S,G,rpt,I) State Table, which contains one row for each
        source, group and interface for which PIM has interface-specific
        (S,G,rpt) state.

   10.  The PIM Bidir DF-Election Table, which contains one row per
        interface for each Rendezvous Point (RP) for which
        Bidirectional-PIM Designated Forwarder (DF) election state is
        maintained.

   11.  The PIM SSM Range Table, which contains one row per range of
        multicast group addresses to which SSM semantics [RFC3569]
        should be applied.

   12.  The PIM Static RP Table, which contains one row per range of
        multicast group addresses for which a particular configured RP
        should be used.

Internet-Draft                   PIM MIB                       July 2005


   13.  The PIM Group Mapping Table, which contains one row for each
        mapping from a multicast group address prefix to the PIM mode
        and RP address to use for groups within that group prefix,
        regardless of the source of the group mapping information.

   14.  The BSR Candidate-RP Table, which contains one row for each
        multicast group address prefix for which the local router is to
        advertise itself as a Candidate-RP.

   15.  The BSR RP-Set Table, which contains one row for each group
        mapping that was learned via BSR.

   16.  The BSR Candidate-BSR Table, which contains Candidate-BSR
        configuration for the local router.

   17.  The BSR Elected BSR Table, which contains one row for each
        elected BSR.

   This MIB module uses textual conventions defined in the IF-MIB
   [RFC2863], the INET-ADDRESS-MIB [RFC4001] and the IANA-RTPROTO-MIB.

            Rows in this table are created for a variety of reasons,

               created and destroyed as a result of rows in the
               pimSsmRangeTable and pimStaticRPTable being created and
               destroyed.

            -  Rows with a pimGroupMappingOrigin value of 'bsr' are
               created as a result of running the PIM Bootstrap Router
               (BSR) mechanism.  If the local router is not the elected
               BSR, these rows are created to correspond to group
               prefixes in the PIM Bootstrap messages received from the
               elected BSR.  If the local router is the elected BSR,
               these rows are created to correspond to group prefixes in
               the PIM Bootstrap messages that the local router sends.
               In either case, these rows are destroyed when the group
               prefixes are timed out by the BSR mechanism.

            -  Rows with a pimGroupMappingOrigin value of 'other' are
               created and destroyed according to some other mechanism
               not specified here.

            Given the collection of rows in this table at any point in
            time, the PIM mode and RP address to use for a particular
            group is determined using the following algorithm.

            1. From the set of all rows, the subset whose group prefix
               contains the group in question are selected.

            2. If there are no such rows, the behavior is undefined.

            3. If there is at least one such row, from the selected
               subset of rows, the subset that have the lowest value
               of pimGroupMappingPrecedence are selected.

            4. From the selected subset of rows, the subset that have
               the greatest value of pimGroupMappingGrpPrefixLength are
               selected.

            5. If there are multiple selected rows, the subset that have
               pimGroupMappingActive set to 'true' are selected.  There
               must be at least one such row.

            6. If there are multiple selected rows, the row selected is
               implementation dependent; the implementation might or
               might not apply the PIM hash function to select the row.

            7. The group mode to use is given by the value of
               pimGroupMappingPimMode from the single selected row; the
               RP to use is given by the value of

5.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   TODO.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   TODO.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

6.  IANA Considerations

   PIM-STD-MIB should be rooted under the mib-2 subtree.  IANA is
   requested to assign { mib-2 XXX } to the PIM-STD-MIB module specified
   in this document.
