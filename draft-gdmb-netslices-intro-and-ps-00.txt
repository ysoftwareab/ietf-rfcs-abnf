1.  Introduction

   Network slicing (NS) refers to the managed partitions of physical
   and/or virtual network resources, network physical/virtual and
   service functions that can act as an independent instance of a
   network and/or as a network cloud.  Network resources include
   connectivity, compute and storage resources.

   Slices considerably transform the networking perspective by
   abstracting, isolating, orchestrating, softwarizing and separating
   logical network components from the underlying physical network
   resources and as such they enhance Internet architecture.

   For slice creation, the management plane creates the grouping of
   physical and virtual network resources, connects with the physical
   and virtual network and service functions as appropriate and it
   instantiates all the network and service functions assigned to the
   slice.  On the other hand for slice operations the slice control
   takes over the control and governing of all the network resources,
   network functions and service functions assigned to the slice, and
   (re-) configure them as appropriate and as per elasticity needs in
   order to provide an end-to-end service.

   Network operators can exploit NS to significantly reduce operations
   expenditures, and enable softwarization, programmability and the
   innovation necessary to enrich the offered services.  Network
   softwarization techniques [IMT2020-2015], [IMT2020-2016] may be used

   to realised and manage [MANO-2014] network slicing.  NS provides the
   means for the network operators to provide network programmable
   capabilities to OTT providers and other market players without
   changing their physical infrastructure.  NS enables the concurrent
   deployment of multiple logical, self-contained and independent,
   shared or partitioned networks on a common infrastructure.  Slices
   support also dynamic multi-services, multi-tenancy and the
   integration means for vertical market players.

   The purpose of NS work in IETF is to develop a set of protocols and/
   or protocol extensions that enable efficient slice creation,
   activation / deactivation, composition, elasticity, orchestration,
   management, isolation, guaranteed SLA and safe operations within a
   network or network cloud / data centre environment that assumes an IP
   and/or MPLS-based underlay.

   While there are, isolated efforts being carried out in several IETF
   working groups DETNET, [I-D.leeking-actn-problem-statement],
   [I-D.dong-network-slicing-problem-statement],
   [I-D.galis-anima-autonomic-slice-networking], [IETF-Slicing1],
   [IETF-Slicing2], [IETF-Slicing3], [IETF-Slicing4], [IETF-Slicing5] to
   achieve certain aspects of network slice functions and operations,
   there is a clear need to look at complete life-cycle management
   characteristics of network Slicing solutions though the discussions
   based on the following architectural tenets:

   o Underlay tenet: support for an IP/MPLS-based underlay data plane
   the transport network used to carry that underlay.

   o Governance tenet: a logically centralized authority for network
   slices in a domain.

   o Separation tenet: slices are independent and have appropriate
   degree of isolation (1) from each other.

   o Capability exposure tenet: each slice allows third parties to
   access via APIs information regarding services provided by the slice
   (e.g. connectivity information, QoS, mobility, autonomicity, etc.)
   within the limits set by the operator.

   NS approaches that do not adhere to these tenets are explicitly
   outside of the scope of the proposed work at IETF.

   In pursuit of the solutions described above, there is a need to
   document an architecture for network slicing within both wide area
   network and a data center environments.

   Elicitation of requirements ([RFC2119], [RFC4364]) for a network
   slice control and management planes and will be needed facilitating
   the selection, extension, and/or development of the protocol for each
   of the functional interfaces identified to support the architecture.

   Additionally, documentation on the common use-cases for slice
   validation for 5G is needed (e.g. mission-critical ultra-low latency
   communication services; massive-connectivity machine communication
   services - smart metering, smart grid and sensor networks; extreme
   QoS; Independent operations and management; Independent cost and/or
   energy optimisation; Independent multi-topology routing; multi-tenant
   operations, etc.).

   The proposed NS work would be co-ordinated with other IETF WGs (e.g.
   TEAS WG, DETNET WG, ANIMA WG, NETCONF WG, SUPA WG, NVO3 WG, Routing
   Area WG (RTGWG), Network Management Research Group (NMRG) and NFV
   Research Group (NFVRG)) to ensure that the commonalities and
   differences in solutions are properly considered.  Where suitable
   protocols, models or methods exist, they will be preferred over
   creating new ones.

1.1.  Notes

   (1) This issue require efficient interaction between an upper layer
   in the hierarchy and a lower layer for QoS guaranties and most of the
   operations on slicing.

2.  Suggested Problems and Work Areas

   The goal of this work is to develop one or more protocol
   specifications (or extensions to existing protocols) to address the
   following problem areas.  These problems were selected according to
   the analysis of the technical gaps in IETF protocols ecosystem.

   o Uniform Reference Model for Network Slicing; Describe all elements
   and instances of a network slice.  Describe shared non-sliced network
   parts.

   o Slice Templates: Design the slices to different scenarios
   ([ChinaCom-2009], [GENI-2009], [IMT2020-2016bis], [NGMN-2016],
   [NGS-3GPP-2016], [ONF-2016]); an appropriate slice template
   definition that may include capability exposure of managed partitions
   of physical and/or virtual network resources (i.e.  connectivity,
   compute and storage resources), physical and/or virtual network and
   service functions that can act as an independent network and/or as a
   network cloud.

   needed):

       * Four-dimensional efficient slice isolation with guarantees for
         isolation in Data / Control / Management / Service planes.
         Enablers for safe and efficient multi-tenancy in slices.

         acquisition, global resource view formed; global energy view
         formed; Network Slice deployed based on global resource
         and energy efficiency; Mapping algorithms.

       * Monitoring status and behaviour of NS in a single and/or
         muti-domain environment.

      extensibility (4) , safety (5) , Sizing and
      scalability of the slicing model per network and
      per network cloud.

    * Autonomic slice management and operation (i.e. self-configuration,
      self-composition, self-monitoring, self-optimisation,
      self-elasticity are carried as part of the slice protocols).

    * Slice stitching / composition: Enablers for efficient stitching /
      composition/ decomposition of slices:

        - vertically (service + management + control planes) and/or
        - horizontally (between different domains part of access,
          core, edge segments) and /or
        - vertically + horizontally.

    * E2E wireline network segments and network clouds orchestration
      of slices ([GUERZONI-2016], [KARL-2016]).

    * Service Mapping: Dynamic Mapping of Services to slices; YANG
      models for slices.

   o Efficient enablers for Integration of above capabilities and
   operations.

2.1.  Notes

   (2) Protection refers to the related mechanisms so that events within
   one slice, such as congestion, do not have a negative impact on
   another slice.

   (3) Elasticity refers to the mechanisms and triggers for the growth
   /shrinking of network resources, network and service functions.

   (4) Extensibility refers to the ability to expand a NS with
   additional functionality and/or characteristics or through
   modification of existing functionality/characteristics, while
   minimizing impact to existing functions.

   (5) Safety refers to the conditions of being protected against
   different types and the consequences of failure, error harm or any
   other event, which could be considered non-desirable.
