   months. Internet Drafts may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by

      connection.  The first octet of the <authentication-type-pair>
      value is KERBEROS_V4, to indicate the usage of Kerberos version 4.

   IAC SB AUTHENTICATION REPLY <authentication-type-pair> ACCEPT IAC SE

      This command indicates that the authentication was successful.

   IAC SB AUTHENTICATION REPLY <authentication-type-pair> REJECT <op-
   tional reason for rejection> IAC SE

      This command indicates that the authentication was not successful,
      and if there is any more data in the sub-option, it is an ASCII
      text message of the reason for the rejection.

   IAC SB AUTHENTICATION IS <authentication-type-pair> CHALLENGE <en-
   crypted challenge> IAC SE
   IAC SB AUTHENTICATION REPLY <authentication-type-pair> RESPONSE <en-
   crypted response> IAC SE

      These two commands are used to perform mutual authentication.
      They are only used when the AUTH_HOW_MUTUAL bit is set in the
      second octet of the authentication-type-pair.  After successfully
      sending an AUTH and receiving an ACCEPT, a CHALLENGE is sent.  The
      challenge is a random 8 byte number with the most significant byte
      first, and the least significant byte last.  When the CHALLENGE
      command is sent, the "encrypted challenge" is the 8-byte-challenge
      encrypted in the session key.  When the CHALLENGE command is re-
      ceived, the contents are decrypted to get the original 8-byte-
      challenge, this value is then incremented by one, re-encrypted
      with the session key, and returned as the "encrypted response" in
      the RESPONSE command.  The receiver of the RESPONSE command de-
      crypts the "encrypted response", and verifies that the resultant
      value is the original 8-byte-challenge incremented by one.

      The "encrypted challenge" value sent/received in the CHALLENGE
      command is also encrypted with the session key on both sides of
      the session, to produce a random 8-byte key to be used as the de-
      fault key for the ENCRYPTION option.


3.  Implementation Rules

   If the second octet of the authentication-type-pair has the AUTH_WHO
   bit set to AUTH_CLIENT_TO_SERVER, then the client sends the initial
   AUTH command, and the server responds with either ACCEPT or REJECT.
   In addition, if the AUTH_HOW bit is set to AUTH_HOW_MUTUAL, and the
   server responds with ACCEPT, then the client then sends a CHALLENGE,
   and the server sends a RESPONSE.

   If the second octet of the authentication-type-pair has the AUTH_WHO

   bit set to AUTH_SERVER_TO_CLIENT, then the server sends the initial
   AUTH command, and the client responds with either ACCEPT or REJECT.
   In addition, if the AUTH_HOW bit is set to AUTH_HOW_MUTUAL, and the
   client responds with ACCEPT, then the server then sends a CHALLENGE,
   and the client sends a RESPONSE.

   The authenticator (Kerberos Principal) used is of the form
   "rcmd.host@realm".

4.  Examples

   User "joe" may wish to log in as user "pete" on machine "foo".  If
   "pete" has set things up on "foo" to allow "joe" access to his ac-
   count, then the client would send IAC SB AUTHENTICATION NAME "pete"
   IAC SE IAC SB AUTHENTICATION IS KERBEROS_V4 AUTH <joe's kerberos
   ticket> IAC SE The server would then authenticate the user as "joe"
   from the ticket information, and since "pete" is allowing "joe" to
   use his account, the server would send back ACCEPT.  If mutual au-
   thentication is being used, the the client would send a CHALLENGE,
   and verify the RESPONSE that the server sends back.
