   restoration mechanisms. This analysis results in potential control
   protocols enhancements required to achieve the fast-restoration
   targets.

1. Introduction - Scope

   In the context of packet-over-optical networks, also known Packet“
   over-Wavelength (POW) networks, the restoration approach depends on
   the service being offered. Restoration can happen either at the
   packet layer, the optical layer or both. In the latter case,
   coordination between the various restoration schemes is required to
   maximize efficiency and avoid conflicting actions occurring at
   different layers. The scope of this memo is to define and extend the
   proposed mechanisms for a packet over all-optical network where
   packet capable interfaces are only available on O/E/O capable
   devices.

   Relationship with TE design team work
   -------------------------------------

   This work can be found at http://search.ietf.org/internet-
   drafts/draft-ietf-tewg-restore-hierarchy-00.txt. This document does
   not seem to encourage multi-layer survivability since it explicitly
   mentions:

      ŸFor hierarchy, there did not appear to be a driving
      near-term need for work on "vertical hierarchy," defined as
      communication between network layers such as TDM/optical and
      MPLS. In particular, instead of direct exchange of signaling and
      Routing between vertical layers, some looser form of coordination
      and communication, such as the specification of hold-off timers,
      is a nearer term need.÷

   However, it does not seem that it strictly precludes any enhanced
   mechanisms (and I-Ds) for a longer-term period.

2. Restoration Strategies

   Prior to restoration, fault detection and fault location must be
   performed. This can happen at the packet and/or optical layer.
   Nevertheless, fault detection and location can be performed
   simultaneously (within the same layer). Various mechanisms can be
   used to achieve this (some of them may be extended for the hybrid
   packet/optical case). Following detection and notification of the
   failure to the nodes responsible for restoration, restoration is
   performed.

   In all possible cases, we assume that both the packet and optical
   layers have their own control entities (in a general case, these are
   instantiations of various signaling, routing and management
   protocols). No assumption is made on the physical location of these
   controlling entities. They could be centralized or distributed, with
   dynamic or static behavior.

   For efficient Packet-Optical interaction, a well-defined message
   exchange between the packet and optical control entities is
   required. The so-called integrated Packet-Optical control entity,
   similar to the concept of a Packet Optical Network Controller (PONC)
   should be informed as soon as possible of the failures and their
   location. The PONC may or may not be involved in the restoration
   based on the selected scheme, but can be responsible for overall
   network re-optimization once the restoration is performed.

   Optical network re-optimization implies to define what a Lambda-
   Packet LSP restoration mechanism requires in terms of restoration
   time, spare resources, mechanism robustness, capabilities, etc.
   Consequently, we need to first define what re-optimization means by
   keeping the topological information prior to the various restoration
   processes performed. This in turn requires to define which are the
   constraints to keep the same topology that the one prior to the
   failure or take into account the updated "availability" values into
   account in order to have a new topology (in fact this could be
   mapped to a dampening mechanism).

   Our analysis covers different scenarios, where there may be various
   intermediate layers between the Packet and Optical Layers. Since a
   common goal in optical network development is to simplify the
   layering (to have the Packet Layer directly over the Optical Layer),
   we examine a strategy where only the Packet and Optical Layers
   participate in the restoration process. This method can still apply
   in cases where some intermediate layers exist. All of these
   scenarios consider cases where failures occur at the Optical Channel
   Layer (i.e. Lambda Layer) or the Physical Layer (i.e. Fiber Layer).
   They can be extended to include Packet Layer LSP failures, which is
   the ultimate goal of the top-down strategy (see Section 3).

   Also, these scenarios consider failures within the optical network
   and not packet to optical Ÿaccess÷ failures (physical connectivity
   between packet and optical device) or intermediate layers such as
   ATM (Layer2) and Sonet/SDH (Layer1). In this case, alternative
   strategies may be used at both the packet and optical layer. Most of
   these intermediate layers will provide M:N, 1:N and/or 1:1
   restoration mechanisms or have an access path protection while
   relying on Sonet/SDH overhead for failure detection. If neither the
   Sonet/SDH nor the Optical Channel Layer (i.e. Lambda Layer) provide
   a restoration mechanism then Layer3 should handle the restoration.

   The approach should be Sonet/SDH or even G.709 independent since the
   target is to address packet over lambda switching networks (i.e.
   Sonet/SDH is only used as a framing procedure). It should also
   define the appropriate mechanisms to allow the packet and optical
   layers to efficiently cooperate while providing the required
   restoration. This implies that the control plane mechanisms
   currently defined in [GMPLS-SIG] need to be extended.

3. Escalation Strategies

   This section details the different escalation scenarios and the
   corresponding inter-layer interactions.

3.1 Scenarios

   The various scenarios analyzed in this document can be described as
   follows:

   1. The optical layer handles the restoration: in this case, the
     restoration will be transparent to the packet layer. This is
     generally achieved by having pre-provisioned (or not) optical
     paths in a 1+1, 1:1 or 1:N scheme within the optical network or
     establishing them when required. Refer for instance to [IPO-REST]
     where optical-layer restoration mechanisms are fully detailed.

   2. The packet layer handles the restoration. In this case, we assume
     that the packet layer is made aware of the optical channel or
     fiber layer failure within the optical network through GMPLS-based
     Notification like the one proposed in [GMPLS-RSVP] or [GMPLS-
     CRLDP] for instance or through PONC for example. Under this
     assumption, the packet layer handles the restoration by putting
     traffic over alternate paths that have not been affected by the
     failure. The restoration path can be either pre-established or
     established on request by the packet layer. The PONC can in turn
     perform a longer term overall network optimization.

   3. The packet and optical layer coordinate the overall restoration:
     This can happen in various scenarios. For example, the optical is
     responsible for restoration but is not able to find sufficient
     optical bandwidth within the optical network or in a similar way,
     the packet layer is responsible for restoration but can not fit
     the restored traffic onto alternate unaffected Layer-3 paths. In
     both of these cases, the optical and packet layers should
     cooperate to achieve the right recovery. In this case, it is
     important to make sure that restoration at both levels does
     interact positively. For example, hold-off timers may be used to
     inform one of the layers to wait until the results of the action
     performed by the other layer is known. However, by combining
     inter-layer synchronization a better restoration time should be
     achieved.

3.2 Packet/Optical Layer Interaction and Escalation Strategy

   This section focuses on the inter-working aspects of packet and
   optical restoration aspects.

   The escalation strategy is defined by the set of detection functions
   describing:
   - the originating failure
   - the protection functions applied within the recovery process
   - and the interaction between the upper and/or lower layers
    protection functions applied during the recovery process.

Papadimitriou D. et al “ Internet Draft - Expires May 2002           4

draft-pbh-packet-optical-escalation-02.txt               November 2001



   The escalation strategies are governed either by arbitrarily setting
   failure detection and recovery completion time or by explicit
   message exchange between the layers.

   Two main escalation strategies (also referred to as inter-working
   strategy) are currently defined and briefly summarized here:

   - Bottom-up strategy starts at closest layer to the failure
    (generally the bottom layer) and escalates toward the upper layer
    upon expiration of the recovery timer (hold-off timer). This timer
    is defined in such a way that is allocates Ÿenough time÷ for the
    lower layer(s) to detect the failure, execute the recovery process
    and recovery completion time before triggering recovery process
    defined at the higher layer(s).

   - Top-down strategy starts at the upper(most) layer and escalates
    downward to the lower layer(s); depending on the working level, the
    top-down strategy is suitable when each of the layers define Class-
    of-Services (CoS) so that the escalation strategy might take this
    CoS into account when executing the recovery process.

   A combination of these strategies known as the Hybrid Strategy
   refers to an approach where both upper (in this case the
   packet/MPLS) layer and the lower layer collaborate in order to
   achieve the fastest restoration.

3.3 Bottom-Up Strategy

   In packet LSP over lambda layer (i.e. optical channel layer), the
   following escalation strategy can be defined, where the physical
   layer (optical transmission) triggers the OCh layer protection
   mechanism. Subsequently, if this mechanism does not restore the
   connection within a given maximum restoration time the upper layer
   (LSP restoration mechanism is performed). For that purpose, the
   thresholds (hold-off timers) at which the upper-layer protection
   needs to be Ÿexecuted÷ must be initially configured and subsequently
   dynamically re-evaluated each time the network experience a failure.
   A mechanism like the ones defined in [IPO-RFR] and [IPO-RMR] can be
   used for that purpose.

   The Bottom-up strategy is generally considered as having the
   shortest recovery time (with respect to the Top-Down escalation
   strategy), since recovery takes place as close as possible to the
   failure. Another advantage to this strategy is that the coarser
   switching granularity of the lower layers can simplify recovery,
   since fewer individual flows may need to be re-routed. A drawback,
   however is the coordination required between layers, which are
   capable of initiating recovery.

   Therefore, the following escalation strategy can be defined (here we
   assume FSC capable interfaces, so that GMPLS signalling is also
   considered at the lowest fiber-port layer):

   This is basically the classical approach applied today in most of
   transmission networks, where the TDM Layer has in most cases an
   embedded protection mechanism which by definition decouples the
   circuit-level from the packet-level restoration mechanisms. At the
   packet layer, IP re-routing is the mechanism used to switch from the
   primary to the secondary path.

   The major drawback of this approach comes from the slow restoration
   time. In this case, the Network Management System (NMS) of the TDM
   Layer is not efficient and robust enough to provide fast restoration
   mechanism for a large number of TDM-LSP to be restored within a
   small period of time (i.e. for instance, within a second). This
   occurs when any backup LSP is provisioned and when any pre-

Papadimitriou D. et al “ Internet Draft - Expires May 2002           6

draft-pbh-packet-optical-escalation-02.txt               November 2001


   computation of the backup LSP routes is performed prior to the
   failure occurrence.

   This approach is based on the common coordination achieved by
   resorting the escalation strategies. At each level, the resiliency
   scheme is activated sequentially starting from the lower to the
   upper layer. This implies that at each level the detection of a
   failure condition (and restoration time) triggers either a
   protection/restoration mechanism and if the protection/restoration
   completion time is reached then triggers an upper-layer
   protection/restoration mechanism.

3.4 Top-Down Strategy

   As described in [RES-MLN], in a top-down escalation strategy,
   recovery is always initiated at the higher layer (for instance, the
   packet or MPLS layer) and escalates downward. For instance, a fast
   protection/restoration scheme starts at the higher layer and is
   combined with a slowest protection/restoration scheme at the lower
   layer.

   If a given layer (for instance, the packet layer) cannot find the
   resources that are needed for recovery, it can still escalate a
   recovery request to a lower layer (for instance, the optical channel
   or lambda layer) asking for the establishment of a new optical
   channels (i.e. lambda-switched LSP) to carry the packet traffic that
   could not be recovered at the packet layer.

   The rationale for a top-down approach is that it allows a fine
   differentiation of the availability levels of individual packet
   traffic streams. This allows different recovery actions to take
   place for service classes with different reliability requirements. A
   fiber cut may affect many flows from different service classes,
   which should not all be recovered in the same manner (or recovered
   at all).

   From a capacity efficiency point-of-view, top-down escalation is
   much better than bottom-up escalation if one wants a finer control
   over the availability levels of individual packet traffic streams.
   Top-down escalation does not require the partitioning of optical
   layer resources into separate sinks for each of the packet traffic
   availability classes. A disadvantage is that since the lower layer
   paths supporting higher layers may be physically very long, the
   recovery process may involve network elements at great distances
   from the original failure.

   Top-down escalation strategy starts at the upper-(most) layer and
   escalates downward to the lower layer(s); depending on the working
   level, the top-down strategy is suitable when each of the layers
   define its own Class-of-Services (CoS) so that the escalation
   strategy might take this CoS into account when executing the
   recovery process. In this case, the message exchange starts in the
   optical network, which passes the failure notification until

   restoration domain.

3.5 Hybrid Strategy

   The hybrid strategy is a combination of a top-down and bottom-up
   approach. By using this approach, the layer n+1 (for instance, the
   packet layer) and the layer n (for instance, the lambda layer)
   cooperates by initiating after synchronization their own restoration
   procedures. Notice that the layer n-1 (for instance, the fiber
   layer) does not simultaneously participate to the common restoration
   process.

   If for instance, we focus on the hybrid process between the packet
   and the lambda layer then this strategy can be represented as
   follows:

   The lower layer that triggers the Ÿerror condition÷ sends a message
   to the upper layers (in this case the packet layer). This error

   condition message flows from the fiber to the packet layer. Then,
   the receipt of the message by the upper layer “ it could be a
   summary or an aggregation of lower layer messages “ triggers the
   synchronization of the network resources (i.e. the links, the LSPs,
   etc.) that each layer will restore.

4. Restoration Synchronization

   As described in the previous section (see Section 3.5) when using
   hybrid restoration strategies, both packet and lambda layer
   initiates their own restoration procedure but only after being
   synchronized at the initial time T0. After a certain period of time
   determined by a restoration timer, at T(RTR), each layer re-
   synchronize its actions by exchanging the status of the LSPs they
   planned to restore at the initial time T0. Then if all the LSPs have
   been restored the process stops otherwise they restart the previous
   process by eliminating the already restored LSPs. The process is
   completed when any network resource identified during the initial
   synchronization exchange has been restored.

   This procedure can be consequently described through the following
   steps:


       .====================.       .=========== .    Layer n+1
     ^ |                    |\     /|          ^ |
     | .                    . \   / .          | .
     | |                    |  \ /  |          | |
     | .                    .  /.\  .          | .
     | |                    | / | \ |          | |
     v .                    ./  .  \.          V .
       |====================|   |   |=========== |    Layer n
       .                    .   .   .            .
       |                    |   |   |            |
       .                    .   .   .            .         Time
     --|--------------------|---|---|------------|-------------->
    Start T0                < T(RTR)>         T(RTR)+s

       .                                         .
       .                                         .
       <------------------ RP ------------------->

   The restoration period (RP) is determined by the following formula
   RP = k x T(RTR) + s, as illustrated in the above figure.

   In the hybrid model, the timing plays a very important role. The
   idea is to define a restoration hold-off timer per layer but also a
   restoration quantum time (i.e. a restoration interval or timer RTR)
   during which synchronization of the restoration between layers can
   occur.

5. Multi-Failures

   The previous sections describe the behavior of the hybrid strategy
   for single failures. This section details the procedure for multi-
   failures throughout the same layer and within the same sub-network.
   In this case independent restoration principle (detailed in [IPO-
   REST] does not apply).

   In this context, the main challenges are the following:
   - nodes being involved in the fault localization and notification
   process must be exchange their status in order to synchronize their
   actions (or the actions of any other restoration pro-active node in
   case of non co-location)
   - since the load (the number of active LSPs) on each node is random
   even if bounded by its link capabilities, the restoration quantum
   time becomes dependent on the relative load between nodes (= dL).

   While the first requirement seems obvious to fulfil, the second one
   is tightly related to the current Maximum Bandwidth (MB) and
   Unreserved Bandwidth (UB) parameter defined in [GMPLS-RTG]. Knowing
   this value per link (or bundle) provides the capability to evaluate
   the T(RTR) value. In a first approach, this parameter can be
   formulated as:

        T(RTR)[i] depends on f[i] x dL[i|N]

        with dL[i|N] =  [(MB[i]“UB[i])/Sum(MB-UB)]

   Where T(RTR)[i] = T(RTR) at node Ÿi÷
         MB[i]     = Sum of the MB for all links at node Ÿi÷
         UB[i]     = Sum of the UB for all links at node Ÿi÷
         f[i]      = restoration performance factor (a constant value)

   Note: details concerning the restoration performance factor are
   outside the scope of this document.

6. Conclusion: Applicability of the ŸEscalation Strategies÷

   In this document, we describe two well-known escalation strategies
   referred to as bottom-up and top-down strategies. When considering
   packet-over“optical networks, the bottom-up strategy is the most
   Ÿused÷ since coming directly from Ÿdigital÷ transmission TDM
   networks. However, with the current profound and fundamental change
   in transmission technologies where all-optical channels replaces
   SDH/Sonet circuits (and SDH/Sonet is only use as a framing
   procedure), switching capabilities are now concentrated on two
   layers: the packet and the optical layer.

   From these considerations, and the generalization of the mechanisms
   for IP-based control planes, well-known concepts in the packet layer
   will be applied to optical layer as well, such as Class-of-Services.
   Moreover, since now the Ÿcircuits÷ are to be considered as huge
   pipes, the multiplexing capabilities are concentrated at the packet
   layer (i.e. using LSP multiplexing). Depending on the LSP
   multiplexing rate and the available discrete bit-rate at the optical

Papadimitriou D. et al “ Internet Draft - Expires May 2002          10

draft-pbh-packet-optical-escalation-02.txt               November 2001


   layer, a top-down approach can be considered when for instance the
   optical layer does not provide restoration mechanisms or signal
   quality monitoring capabilities so that the re-routing must be
   performed at the upper-layer.

   Nevertheless, it doesnËt seem to be the most efficient way to
   perform restoration within the network since for instance, a huge
   number of packet LSPs can be multiplexed into a 40Gbps lambda-LSP.
   Consequently, if we consider (and when the optical layer enables it)
   simultaneous restoration at optical and packet layer then,
   advantages of both layers can be combined in order to achieve a
   faster restoration comparing to one achieved when using a top-down
   approach.

   This hybrid process can be considered as the best method when for
   instance, some of the packet-LSP are Ÿin size÷ comparable to the
   bit-rate of the optical channel into which they are multiplexed (for
   instance, 1:N multiplexing with N < 8) while the majority of the
   packet-LSP are Ÿin size÷ very small compared to the bit-rate of the
   optical channel into which they are multiplexed (for instance, 1:N
   multiplexing with N > 128) but using a comparable number of lambda-
   LSP. In the first case a Ÿtop-down÷ approach can be considered while
   in the second case a Ÿbottom-up÷ approach can be efficiently
   considered. Therefore, when a physical layer failure occurs implying
   to consider simultaneously both scenarios then an hybrid packet-
   optical restoration mechanism is the most suitable.

   Consequently, the applicability scope of these strategies is
   dependent on the relative LSP granularity shared between nodes
   belonging to the same sub-network. This can be translated by a
   factor G per node and per layer G[i|M], where, M = 1,..,i,..,n which
   gives the relative granularity of the LSP per node and per layer.

   Using the factor G, the applicability criteria of the restoration
   strategies can then be summarized as follows:
   - if G[I|n+1] < G[I|n] then apply a bottom-up strategy
   - if G[I|n+1] > G[I|n] then apply a top-down strategy
   - if G[I|n+1] = G[I|n] then apply a hybrid strategy

7. Further Studies

   This analysis results in potential control protocols enhancements
   required in order to achieve the fast-restoration targets.

   Control Protocol enhancements need to be refined which can support
   the following requirements:
   - They need to accommodate each model (bottom-up, top-down, hybrid)
   - They need to function with different number and types of layers in
    the network
   - They must support a wide range of service classes with different
    reliability requirements
