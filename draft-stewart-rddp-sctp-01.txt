Internet-Draft          SCTP RDMA/DDP Adaptation           December 2002


1. Introduction

   This document describes a method to adapt Direct Data Placement (DDP)
   and Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) to Stream Control Transmission
   Protocol (SCTP) RFC2960 [2] using a generic description found in
   [RDMA-Draft] [4] and [DDP-Draft] [3] This adaption provides a method
   for two peers to know that each side is performing DDP or RDMA thus
   enabling hardware acceleration if available.

   Some implementations may include this adaptation layer within their
   SCTP implementations to obtain maximum performance but the behavior
   of SCTP will be unaffected.  In order to accomplish this we specify
   the use of the new adaptation layer indication as defined in
   [ADDIP-Draft] [6]

1.1 Definitions

   DDP stream - A bi-directional pair of SCTP streams which have the
      same SCTP identifier.

   RNIC - R? Network Interface Card.


1.2 Conventions

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, NOT RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when
   they appear in this document, are to be interpreted as described in
   RFC2119 [1].

2. Data Formats

2.1 Adaptation Layer Indicator

   This mapping places an entire SCTP association into a specific DDP
   mode: DDP or DDP+RDMA.  It is presumed that the handling of incoming
   data chunks for DDP enabled associations is sufficiently different
   than for routine SCTP associations that it is undesirable to mix DDP
   and non-DDP streams in a single association.  An application that
   needs to mix DDP and non-DDP traffic must use use more than a single
   association.

   We define a adaption indication which MUST appear in the INIT or
   INIT-ACK with the following format as defined in [ADDIP-Draft] [6]

   0                   1                   2

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Adaptation Indication:

   The following values are defined for DDP in this document:

       DDP                        - 0x00000001
       DDP+RDMA                   - 0x00000002


   The DDP implementation MAY require that all associations for a given
   SCTP endpoint be placed in the same mode.

   The local interface MAY allow the ULP to accept only requests to
   establish an association in a specified mode.

2.2 Payload Protocol Identifier

   SCTP provides for delivery of user data messages.  Each user message
   consists of a length, the data bytes and a Payload Protocol
   Identifier.  The DDP SCTP adaptation uses two different Payload
   Protocol Identifiers.

   this document:

   A DDP Stream Reset message MUST be presented to the SCTP layer with a
   Payload Protocol Identifer of one and a length of 4 bytes (i.e.  the
   Function Code 0x00000001 with no Function dependant data).

3. SCTP Endpoints

3.1 Adaptation Layer Indication Restriction

   The local interface MUST allow the ULP to specify an SCTP endpoint to
   use a specific Adaptation Indication.  It MAY require the ULP to do
   so.

   Once an endpoint specifies an Adaptation Indication, it SHOULD refuse
   all requests to establish an association with a different Adaptation
   Indication.

   An SCTP implementation MAY choose to accept association requests for
   a given SCTP endpoint only until one association for the endpoint has
   been established.  At that point it MAY choose to restrict all
   further associations for the same endpoint to use the same Adaptation
   Indication.

3.2 Multihoming Implications

   SCTP allows an SCTP endpoint to be associated with multiple IP
   addresses, potentially representing different interface devices.
   Distribution of the logic for a single DDP stream across multiple
   input devices can be very undesirable, resulting in complex cache
   coherency challenges.  Therefore the local interface MAY restrict
   DDP-enabled SCTP endpoints to a single IP address, or to a set of IP
   addresses that are all assigned to the same input device ("RNIC").

   The default binding of a DDP enabled SCTP endpoint SHOULD NOT cover
   more than a single IP address unless doing so results in no
   additional bus traffic or duplication of memory registration
   resources.  This will frequently result in a different default than
   for SCTP endpoints that are not DDP enabled.

   Even when multi-homing is supported, ULPs are cautioned that they
   SHOULD NOT use ULP control of the source address in attempt to
   load-balance a stream across multiple paths.  A receiving DDP/SCTP
   implementation that chooses to support multi-homing SHOULD optimize
   its design on the assumption that multi-homing will be used for
   network fault tolerance, and not to load-balance between paths.  This
   is consistent with recomended SCTP practices.

Internet-Draft          SCTP RDMA/DDP Adaptation           December 2002


4. Number of Streams

   DDP Streams are bidirectional.  They are always composed by pairing
   the inbound and outbound SCTP streams with the same SCTP Stream
   Identifier.

   DDP should request the maximum it will wish to use from SCTP.  DDP
   Streams cannot be used without prior pre-posting of receive
   operations and/or enabling of STags.  Therefore DDP will be able to
   initialize each stream on an "as needed" basis.

   This mapping uses an SCTP association to carry one or more DDP
   Steams.  Each DDP Stream will be mapped to a pair of SCTP streams
   with the same SCTP stream number.  DDP MUST initialize all of its
   SCTP associations with the same number of inbound and outbound
   streams.

5. Fragmentation

5.1 Recomended Version

   Fragmentation of DDP messages is possible at three layers: DDP, SCTP
   and IP.

   The DDP layer is responsible for submitting messages to the SCTP
   layer that conform to the PMTU.  The SCTP layer MAY assume this has
   been done.  The DDP layer MAY also wish to set the fragmentation
   point (usualy termed SCTP_MAXSEG) to a low enough value to assure
   that PMTU changes will not cause IP fragmentation.

   It is possible that the DDP layer and SCTP layer are sufficiently
   separated that the DDP layer will know of PMTU changes later than the
   SCTP layer.  In such an environment, the SCTP layer SHOULD segment
   DDP submitted messages to conform to the Path MTU when necessary.

   When the SCTP layer does not segment, or when the Path MTU first
   changes, the SCTP packet will be rejected for being too large.  SCTP
   already provides for the packet to be fragmented at the IP layer by
   the sender.  This process ensures that the SCTP layer will discover
   PMTU changes.

   Each DDP Segment to be sent MUST be presented to the SCTP layer as a
   single message.  Because the SCTP layer MUST inform the DDP layer of
   all changes to the path MTU, each presented message will typically
   fit in a single SCTP Data Chunk.  However,  relaying of PMTU change
   notices, formatting and submission of messages may all be
   asynchronous interfaces.  Therefore it is possible that a single DDP
   message may be formatted into multiple STCP data chunks by the SCTP
   layer.

   While unlikely, SCTP layer fragmentation is preferable to IP
   fragmentation.  If received in order, each SCTP fragmented data chunk
   is immediately placable.  Each SCTP fragment can be validated and
   acked.  The first data chunk will always contain the complete DDP
   header.  With IP fragmentation, DDP placement cannot take place until
   after the entire IP datagram is reassembled.

   An integrated DDP/SCTP receiver MUST NOT assume that fragmentation
   will only occur at the DDP and IP layers.  It MUST be ready to
   properly handle both IP and SCTP fragmentation as specified by those
   protocols.

5.2 Alternate Version

   A DDP/SCTP Receiver already must deal with fragementation at both the

   IP and DDP Layers.  Therefore the sending DDP layer MUST disable SCTP
   layer segmenting of data chunks.  If the DDP layer presents messages
   that are too large, the result will be IP fragmentation.  While SCTP
   layer fragmentation is theoretically preferable, virtually all
   fragmentation will be done at the DDP layer.  Because SCTP layer
   fragmentation would only be invoked under corner conditions, its
   benefits do not justify the complexity of its inclusion.

6. Unordered Operation

6.1 Recomended Option

   DDP MUST use the Unordered option on all Data Chunks (U Flag set to
   one).  This guarantees that validated SCTP Data Chunks will be
   delivered to the receiving DDP layer promptly.

   Upon delivery, the DDP layer may do placement processing.  However
   the DDP layer MUST NOT deliver a completion to its ULP until after
   the SCTP cumulative Ack point has passed the SCTP packet the data
   chunk was within.

   The SCTP layer SHOULD NOT delay delivery to the DDP layer pending
   actual transmission of the ack.

   Untagged DDP messages carry their own MSN (Message Sequence Number).
   Use of ordered SCTP delivery would only provide a redundant sequence
   number at the cost of delaying delivery of validated SCTP Data Chunks
   to the DDP layer.

6.2 Ordered Operation - Alternate to prior section

   DDP MUST use the Ordered option on all Data Chunks (U Flag set to
   zero).  This guarantees that each stream can process its completions
   without risk of a single missing message holding up all streams on
   the association.

   The SCTP layer SHOULD provided validated SCTP chunks to the DDP layer
   for placement processing as soon as they are available.  The SCTP
   layer MUST deliver SCTP data chunks in order per stream to the DDP
   layer.

   The SCTP layer SHOULD NOT delay delivery to the DDP layer pending
   actual transmission of the ack.

6.3 Unordered Operation With Numbered Messages - 3rd Option

   DDP MUST use the Unordered option on all Data Chunks (U Flag set to
   one).  However, the Message Sequence Number (MSN) MUST be set as
   though the U Flag had been set to zero.

   The SCTP receiver is required by RFC2960 to ignore the received  MSN
   on unordered data chunks.  However, it MUST pass this data through to
   the DDP layer unmodified.

   The DDP layer MAY use the MSN to determine that all prior messages
   for this stream have been acked, and that therefore a message can be

   completed.  If it chooses  to do so, it MUST follow the rules that
   SCTP would have followed for Ordered operation.

7. Procedures

7.1 Association Initialization

   At the startup of an association, an endpoint wishing to perform DDP,
   RDMA, or DDP+RDMA placement MUST include an adaptation layer
   indication in its INIT or INIT-ACK (as defined in Section 2.1.  After
   the exchange of the initial first two SCTP chunks (INIT and
   INIT-ACK), an endpoint MUST verify and inspect the adaptation
   indication and compare it to the following table to determine proper
   action.

        Indication |           Action
          type     |

   ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
                   | This indicates that the peer DOES NOT
       NONE        | support ANY DDP or RDMA adaption and thus
                   | RDMA and DDP procedures MUST NOT be
                   | performed upon this association.
   ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
                   | This indicates that the peer DOES support

   ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
                   | This indicates that the peer supports BOTH
      DDP+RDMA     | RDMA and DDP. If the receiving endpoint
                   | indicated the same, then the procedures in
                   | both [RDMA-Draft] and [DDP-Draft]
                   | MUST be followed. If the local endpoint
   only indicated
                   | RDMA, then ONLY the procedures in
                   | [RDMA-Draft] MUST be followed.
   ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
                   | This indicates that the peer DOES NOT
     ANY-OTHER     | support ANY DDP or RDMA adaption and thus
     Indication    | RDMA and DDP procedures MUST NOT be
                   | performed upon this association.

   ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


7.2 Stream Reset

   DDP [DDP-Draft] requires that a DDP Stream be aborted upon certain
   error conditions such as receiving an untagged message which the
   receiving side ULP had not enabled the reception of.




Stewart, et al.          Expires June 12, 2003                 [Page 12]

Internet-Draft          SCTP RDMA/DDP Adaptation           December 2002


   When a DDP stream is aborted, no further incoming packets will be
   accepted for that stream until the stream is re-established.  Many
   ULPs will maintain a session by re-establishing the DDP stream after
   such a termination.

   Once a DDP Stream is declared to be aborted all DDP Messages on that
   stream MUST be discarded.  Placement MUST NOT be performed.  DDP
   Messages MUST NOT be delivered to the ULP.  New DDP Messages from the
   ULP MUST NOT be accepted.

   The aborted state MUST continue until a DDP Stream Reset Message is
   received.  When this packet is received, the inbound SCTP stream will
   be re-enabled for normal handling of DDP Messages.

   The DDP layer MAY send a DDP SCTP Stream Reset message in a Data
   Chunk to enable re-use of a Stream Identifier within an association
   for a new DDP Stream.  However, it SHOULD select a previously unused
   stream first, if one is available.

   The ability to re-use a Stream Identifier allows an SCTP association
   between two endpoints to remain open indefinitely.  Isolated ULP
   faults will only impact the ULP components using the faulted stream,
   not those merely sharing the same association.

7.3 Chunk Bundling

   SCTP allows multiple Data Chunks to be bundled in a single SCTP
   packet.  Data chunks containing untagged messages SHOULD NOT be
   delayed to facilitate bundling.  Data chunks containing tagged
   messages will generally be full sized, and hence not subject to
   bundling.  However partial sized untagged messages MAY be delayed, as
   that they are frequently followed by a short untagged message.

7.4 STag Validation

   STag validation is to be performed on a per stream basis.  An
   integrated DDP/SCTP implementation MUST NOT enable an STag for an
   entire SCTP association merely because it is enabled for a single
   stream on that association.  The ULP MUST be able to control STag
   enabling on a per stream basis, without regard to which SCTP
   association each stream is a part of.

8. IANA considerations

   This document defines two new Adaptation Layer Indication codepoints:


       DDP                         - 0x00000001
       DDP+RDMA                    - 0x00000002

   This document also defines two new Payload Protocol Identifier
   (PPIDs):

       DDP Message                - 0x00000001
       Adaptation Layer Control   - 0x00000002

9. Security Considerations

   Any direct placement of memory could pose a significant security risk
   if adequate local controls are not provided.  These threats should be
   addressed in the appropriate DDP [DDP-Draft] [3] or RDMA [RDMA-Draft]
   [4] drafts.  This document does not add any additional security risks
   over those found in RFC2960 [2].
