1. Introduction 

   The SEED [RFC4269] is a block cipher, and it can be used in many 
   different modes. This document describes the use of the SEED block 
   cipher algorithm in Counter Mode (CTR), Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) 
   Mode and Galois/Counter Mode (GCM), as an IPsec Encapsulation 
   Security Payload (ESP) [RFC4303] mechanism to provide confidentiality 
   and data origin authentication, and connectionless integrity. 

   This document does not provide an overview of IPsec. However, 
   information about how the various components of IPsec and the way in 
   which they collectively provide security services is available in 
   [RFC4301] and [RFC2411]. 

1.1. Conventions Used in This Document 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

2. Modes 

   This document describes three modes of operation for the use of SEED 
   with IPsec: CBC (Cipher Block Chaining), CTR (Counter), CCM (Counter 
   with CBC-MAC), and GCM (Galois/Counter Mode). 

   SEED in CTR, CCM, and GCM modes is used in IPsec as AES in [RFC4309], 
   [RFC3686], and [RFC4106]. 

3. IKEv2 Conventions 

   This section describes the conventions used to generate keying 
   material and nonces for use with SEED-CTR, keying material and salt 
   values for use with SEED-CCM and SEED-GCM using the Internet Key 
   Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) [RFC4306] protocol. The identifiers and 
   attributes needed to negotiate a security association that uses SEED-
   CTR, SEED-CCM, and SEED-GCM are also defined. 

   3.1. Keying Material 

   IKEv2 makes use of a pseudo-random function (PRF) to derive keying 
   material. The PRF is used iteratively to derive keying material of 
   arbitrary size, called KEYMAT.  Keying material is extracted from the 
   output string without regard to boundaries. 

   The size of KEYMAT MUST be equal or longer than the associated SEED 
   key. The keying material is used as follows:

   SEED-CTR 

      The KEYMAT requested for each SEED-CTR key is 20 octets. The 
      first 16 octets are the 128-bit SEED key, and the remaining four 
      octets are used as the nonce value in the counter block. 

   SEED-CCM 

      The KEYMAT requested for each SEED-CCM key is 19 octets. The 
      first 16 octets are the 128-bit SEED key, and the remaining three 
      octets are used as the salt value in the counter block. 

   SEED-GCM 

      The KEYMAT requested for each SEED-GCM key is 20 octets. The 
      first 16 octets are the 128-bit SEED key, and the remaining four 
      octets are used as the salt value in the nonce. 

3.2. Transform Type 1 

   For IKEv2 negotiations, IANA has assigned three ESP Transform 
   Identifiers for SEED-CTR, SEED-CCM and SEED-GCM, as recorded in 
   Section 5. 

3.3. Key Length Attribute 

   Since SEED only supports one key length, the Key Length attribute 
   MUST be specified in the IKE exchange version 2. The Key Length 
   attribute MUST have a value of 128 bits. 

4. Security Considerations 

   No security problem has been found on SEED. SEED is secure against 
   all known attacks including Differential cryptanalysis, linear 
   cryptanalysis, and related key attacks. The only known attack is an 
   exhaustive search for the key. For further security considerations, 
   the reader is encouraged to read [SEED-EVAL]. 

   See [RFC3610] and [GCM] for security considerations regarding the CCM 
   and GCM Modes of Operation, respectively. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   IANA has assigned Transform Type 1 (Encryption Algorithm) Identifiers 
   for SEED-CTR, SEED-CCM, and SEED-GCM with an explicit IV in the 
   "IKEv2 Parameters" registry:
