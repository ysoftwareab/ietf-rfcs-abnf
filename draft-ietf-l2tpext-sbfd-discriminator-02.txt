1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-bfd-seamless-base] defines a simplified mechanism to use
   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) [RFC5880], referred to as
   Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (S-BFD).  The S-BFD
   mechanisms depend on network nodes knowing the BFD discriminators
   which each node in the network has reserved for this purpose.  S-BFD
   requires the usage of unique discriminators within an administrative
   domain.  The use of Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3)
   [RFC3931] is one possible means of advertising these discriminators.

   This document specifies the encoding to be used when S-BFD
   discriminators are advertised using L2TPv3.

1.1.  Terminology

   The reader is expected to be very familiar with the terminology and
   protocol constructs defined in S-BFD (see Section 2 of
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-seamless-base]) and L2TPv3 (see Section 1.3 of
   [RFC3931]).

2.  S-BFD Target Discriminator ID AVP

   The "S-BFD Target Discriminator ID" AVP is exchanged using the ICRQ,
   ICRP, OCRQ, and OCRP control messages during session negotiations.

Internet-Draft            S-BFD Disc in L2TPv3              January 2016


2.1.  Encoding Format

   The S-BFD Target Discriminator ID AVP, Attribute Type "TBA by IANA",
   is an identifier used to advertise the S-BFD Target Discriminator(s)
   supported by an LCCE for the S-BFD Reflector operation.  This AVP
   indicates that the advertiser implements an S-BFD reflector
   supporting the specified target discriminator(s) and is ready for
   S-BFD Reflector operation.  The receiving LCCE MAY use this AVP if it
   wants to monitor connectivity to the advertising LCCE using S-BFD.

   The Attribute Value field for this AVP has the following format:

   S-BFD Target Discriminator ID (ICRQ, ICRP, OCRQ, OCRP):

                                          No. of octets
      +-----------------------------+
      | Discriminator Value(s)      |     4/Discriminator
      :                             :
      +-----------------------------+

   An LCCE MAY include the S-BFD Discriminator Advertisement AVP in a
   L2TP Control Protocol message (ICRQ, ICRP, OCRQ, OCRP) [RFC3931].
   Multiple S-BFD Discriminators AVPs MAY be advertised by a LCCE.  If
   the other LCCE does not wish to monitor connectivity using S-BFD, it
   MAY safely discard this AVP without affecting the rest of session
   negotiation.  While current use-cases
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-seamless-use-case] of S-BFD require advertisement of
   only one discriminator, the AVP encoding allows specification an
   arbitrary number of discrminators (at least one) for extensibility.
   When multiple S-BFD discriminators are advertised, the mechanism to
   choose a subset of specific discriminator(s) is out of scope for this
   document.

   The S-BFD Target Discriminator ID AVP allows for advertising at least
   one S-BFD Discriminator value:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                         Discriminator 1                       |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                    Discriminator 2 (Optional)                 |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                               ...                             |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                    Discriminator n (Optional)                 |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The M bit of the L2TP Control Protocol Message (ICRQ, ICRP, OCRQ,
   OCRP) [RFC3931] MUST NOT be set inside the S-BFD Target Discriminator
   ID AVP advertisement.

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains a sub-registry "Message Type AVP (Attribute Type 0)
   Values" in the "Control Message Attribute Value Pairs" as per
   [RFC3438].  IANA is requested to assign the first free value from
   this sub-registry as the Message typ AVP for "S-BFD Target
   Discriminator ID".

   A summary of the new AVPs requested for Attribute Type 0 follows:

   Control Message Attribute Value Pairs

         Attribute
         Type          Description
         -----------   ------------------
         TBA by IANA   S-BFD Target Discriminator ID


4.  Security Considerations

   Security concerns for L2TP are addressed in [RFC3931].  Introduction
   of the S-BFD Discriminator Advertisement AVP introduces no new
   security risks for L2TP.

   Advertisement of the S-BFD discriminators does make it possible for
   attackers to initiate S-BFD sessions using the advertised
   information.  The vulnerabilities this poses and how to mitigate them
   are discussed in the Security Considerations section of
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-seamless-base].
