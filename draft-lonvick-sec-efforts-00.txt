Internet-Draft    Security Best Practices Efforts and DocumentsJuly 2004



1.  Introduction


   The Internet is being recognized as a critical infrastructure similar
   in nature to the power grid and a potable water supply.  Just like
   those infrastructures, means are needed to provide resiliency and
   adaptability to the Internet so that it remains consistently
   available to the public throughout the world even during times of
   duress or attack.  For this reason, many SDOs are developing
   standards with hopes of retaining an acceptable level, or even
   improving this availability, to its users.  These SDO efforts usually
   define themselves as "security" efforts.  It is the opinion of the
   authors that there are many different definitions of the term
   "security" and it may be applied in many diverse ways.  As such, we
   offer no assurance that the term is applied consistently throughout
   this document.


   Many of these SDOs have diverse charters and goals and will take
   entirely different directions in their efforts to provide standards.
   However, even with that, there will be overlaps in their produced
   works.  If there are overlaps then there is a potential for conflicts
   and confusion.  This may result in:
      Vendors of networking equipment who are unsure of which standard
      to follow.
      Purchasers of networking equipment who are unsure of which
      standard will best apply to the needs of their business or
      ogranization.
      Network Administrators and Operators unsure of which standard to
      follow to attain the best security for their network.
   For these reasons, the authors wish to encourage all SDOs who have an
   interest in producing, or in consuming standards relating to good
   security practices to be consistent in their approach and their
   recommendations.  In many cases, the authors are aware that the SDOs
   are making good efforts along these lines.  However, the authors do
   not participate in all SDO efforts and cannot know everything that is
   happening.


   The authors of this document would like to keep it open as an
   Internet Draft for approximately 6 months for the date of the first
   submission.  We hope that it will be spread far and wide and that the
   leaders of SDO efforts will contact us with updated information so
   that their own effort may be listed in this document, or so that
   corrections may be made.


   Comments on this document may be addressed to the authors.

2.  Format of this Document


   The body of this document has three sections.


   The first part of the body of this document, Section 3, contains a
   listing of online glossaries relating to networking and security.  It
   is very important that the definitions of words relating to security
   and security events be consistent.  Inconsistencies between the
   useage of words on standards is unacceptable as it would prevent a
   reader of two standards to appropriately relate their
   recommendations.  The authors of this document have not reviewed the
   definitions of the words in the listed glossaries so can offer no
   assurance of their alignment.


   The second part, Section 4, contains a listing of SDOs that appear to
   be working on security standards.


   The third part, Section 5, lists the documents which have been found
   to offer good practices or recommendations for securing networks and
   networking devices.

   FAQ and the SANS/FBI Top 20 Vulnerabilities List.


3.2  Internet Security Glossary - RFC 2828


   http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2828.txt


   Created in May 2000, the document defines itself to be, "an
   internally consistent, complementary set of abbreviations,
   definitions, explanations, and recommendations for use of terminology
   related to information system security."  The glossary makes the
   distinction of the listed definitions throughout the document as
   being:
   o  a recommended Internet definition
   o  a recommended non-Internet definition
   o  not recommended as the first choice for Internet documents but
      something that an author of an Internet document would need to
      know
   o  a definition that shouldn't be used in Internet documents
   o  additional commentary or usage guidance


3.3  Compendium of Approved ITU-T Security Definitions


   http://www.itu.int/itudoc/itu-t/com17/activity/def004.html


   Addendum to the Compendium of the Approved ITU-T Security-related
   Definitions
   http://www.itu.int/itudoc/itu-t/com17/activity/add002.html


   These extensive materials were created from approved ITU-T
   Recommendations with a view toward establishing a common
   understanding and use of security terms within ITU-T.

   industry-wide initiative to create the Optical Internetworking Forum,
   an open forum focused on accelerating the deployment of optical
   internetworks.


4.12  NRIC - The Network Reliability and Interoperability Council


   http://www.nric.org/


   The purposes of the Committee are to give telecommunications industry
   leaders the opportunity to provide recommendations to the FCC and to
   the industry that assure optimal reliability and interoperability of
   telecommunications networks.  The Committee addresses topics in the
   area of Homeland Security, reliability, interoperability, and
   broadband deployment.


4.13  T1 - Comittee T1


   http://www.t1.org


   Established in February 1984, Committee T1 develops technical
   standards and reports regarding interconnection and interoperability
   of telecommunications networks.  T1 is sponsored by ATIS and is
   accredited by ANSI.  Committee T1 had six technical subcommittees,
   T1A1, T1E1, T1M1, T1P1, T1S1, and T1X1.  As a result of the recent
   ATIS reorganization on January 1, 2004 Committee T1 as a group no
   longer exists.  The six committees mentioned still exist but there
   are 2 additional ones.  T1M1 is now identified as T1M1 OAM&P and T1M1
   O&B.  The other group that has been split is T1S1 and they are T1S1 -
   signaling (interoperability) and T1S1- packet based networks which
   have now become stand-alone committees under ATIS.  Due to the
   reorganization, some groups may have a new mission and scope
   statement as well as a name change.


4.13.1  T1A1:  Performance, Reliability, and Signal Processing


   http://www.t1.org/t1a1/t1a1.htm


   T1A1 develops and recommends standards, requirements, and technical
   reports related to the performance, reliability, and associated
   security aspects of communications networks, as well as the
   processing of voice, audio, data, image, and video signals, and their
   multimedia integration.


4.13.2  T1E1:  Interfaces, Power & Protection of Networks


   http://www.t1.org/t1e1/t1e1.htm


   T1E1 develops and recommends standards and technical reports related

   to power systems, electrical and physical protection for the exchange
   and interexchange carrier networks, and interfaces associated with
   user access to telecommunications networks.


4.13.3  T1M1:  Management OAM&P (Internetwork Operations,
       Administration, Maintenance and Provisioning)


   http://www.t1.org/t1m1/t1m1.htm


   T1M1 develops internetwork operations, administration, maintenance
   and provisioning standards, and technical reports related to
   interfaces for telecommunications networks.


4.13.4  T1M1 O&B


   There will be a new scope and mission differentiating this group from
   T1M1 OAM&P.  The authors are unsure if they will use the same URL.


   The authors are investigating this and hope to provide a clear scope
   of their effort.


4.13.5  T1P1:  Wireless/Mobile Services and Systems


   http://www.t1.org/t1p1/t1p1.htm


   T1P1 develops and recommends standards and technical reports related
   to wireless and/or mobile services and systems, including service
   descriptions and wireless technologies.


4.13.6  T1S1:  Signaling


   http://www.t1.org/t1s1/t1s1.htm


   T1S1 develops and recommends standards and technical reports related
   to services, architectures, and signaling.  As a result of the
   reorganization, this group may have a new scope and charter.


4.13.7  T1S1:  Packet Based Networks


   As a result of the reorganization this group will also probably have
   a new mission and scope .  The URL for the Signaling group of T1S1
   will currently lead to both of the groups.


4.13.8  T1X1:  Digital Hierarchy and Synchronization


   http://www.t1.org/t1x1/t1x1.htm


   T1X1 develops and recommends standards and prepares technical reports

5.3  American National Standard T1.276-2003 - Baseline Security
    Requirements for the Management Plane


   Abstract: This standard contains a set of baseline security
   requirements for the management plane.  The President's National
   Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee Network Security
   Information Exchange (NSIE) and Government NSIE jointly established a
   Security Requirements Working Group (SRWG) to examine the security
   requirements for controlling access to the public switched network,
   in particular with respect to the emerging next generation network.

   In the telecommunications industry, this access incorporates
   operation, administration, maintenance, and provisioning for network
   elements and various supporting systems and databases.  Members of
   the SRWG, from a cross-section of telecommunications carriers and
   vendors, developed an initial list of security requirements that
   would allow vendors, government departments and agencies, and service
   providers to implement a secure telecommunications network management
   infrastructure.  This initial list of security requirements was
   submitted as a contribution to Committee T1 - Telecommunications,
   Working Group T1M1.5 for consideration as a standard.  The
   requirements outlined in this document will allow vendors, government
   departments and agencies, and service providers to implement a secure
   telecommunications network management infrastructure.

5.6  Common Criteria


   http://csrc.nist.gov/cc/


   Version 1.0 of the CC was completed in January 1996.  Based on a
   number of trial evaluations and an extensive public review, Version
   1.0 was extensively revised and CC Version 2.0 was produced in April
   of 1998.  This became ISO International Standard 15408 in 1999.  The
   CC Project subsequently incorporated the minor changes that had
   resulted in the ISO process, producing CC version 2.1 in August 1999.
