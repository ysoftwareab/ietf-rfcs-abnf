       Signalling one-click functionality for list email headers
                    draft-levine-herkula-oneclick-00

Abstract

   This document describes a method for signaling a one-click function
   for the list-unsubscribe email header.  The need for this arises out
   of the actuality that mail software sometimes fetches URLs in mail
   headers, and thereby accidentally triggers unsubcriptions in the case
   of the list-unsubscribe header.

1.  Introduction

   An [RFC2369] email header can contain HTTP or HTTPS URIs.  In a List-
   Unsubscribe Header the HTTP or HTTPS URI should unsubscribe the
   recipient of the email from the list.  But anti-spam software often
   fetches all resources in mail headers automatically, without any
   action by the user.  As a result of this unintended malicious
   behavior, senders implement landing pages with a confirmation step to
   finish the unsubscribe request.  This document addresses this part of
   the problem, with a POST action for receivers that can be
   distinguished by senders from other requests and therefore handled as
   a one-click unsubscription.

2.  Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP14, [RFC2119].

   One-click describes an action that directly triggers a change in a
   system's state, intended to be applied only with a user's intent.

3.  High-Level Goals

   This document has several goals.

Internet-Draft            One click unsubscribe                July 2016


      Allow email senders to signal "One-Click" functionality for
      specific HTTP and HTTPS URIs used in [RFC2369] email headers.

      Allow MUA designers to implement independent user interface
      features for a better user experience.

      Allow MUA users to trigger intended actions in a familiar
      environment and without leaving the MUA context.

4.  Out of Scope

   This document does not address problems associated with intended
   malicious behavior.

5.  Implementation

5.1.  Mail senders

   An entity which is responsible for sending an email that wishes to
   add an HTTP or HTTPS URI for one-click unsubscriptions places both a
   List-Unsubscribe and a List-Unsubscribe-Post header in the message.
   The List-Unsubscribe-Post header may contain multiple key value pairs
   needed by the sending entity.  It also must contain the key value
   pair "List-Unsubscribe=One-Click" to adhere to this specification.

   The combination of the URI in the List-Unsubscribe header and the
   POST arguments in the List-Unsubscribe-Post header must identify the
   mail recipient, so that the unsubscription process knows what address
   to use.  In particular, "one click" has no way to manually ask the
   user what address he or she wishes to unsubscribe.

   The sending entity needs to provide the infrastructure to handle POST
   requests to the specified URI in the List-Unsubscribe header.

   The "One-Click" action triggered by this URI must complete promptly
   and should never burden the requester in an inappropriate way.  The
   sending entity cannot expect that HTTP redirects are followed by the
   requester.

5.2.  Mail receivers

   A receiving entity which wants to use a List-Unsubscribe HTTP URI
   from an email that also contains a List-Unsubscribe-Post header shall
   perform an HTTP or HTTPS POST to the first HTTP or HTTPS URI in the
   List-Unsubscribe header and send the content of the List-Unsubscribe-
   Post header as request body with the content type set to
   "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".

   The receiving entity MUST NOT perform a POST on the the HTTP or HTTPS
   URI without user consent.  When and how the user consent is obtained
   is not part of this specification.

   The Request must use the HTTP or HTTPS verb POST, other verbs are not
   permitted as especially the HEAD and GET requests should never be
   used in cases where a state change is triggered.  PUT and DELETE
   would offer similar functionality but are often unavailable.

6.  Additional Requirements

   The email needs at least one valid authentication identifier.  In
   this version of the specification the only supported identifier type
   is DKIM [RFC7489], that provides a domain-level identifier in the
   content of the "d=" tag of a validated DKIM-Signature header field.

   The List-Unsubscribe and List-Unsubscribe-Post headers need to be
   included in the "h=" tag of a valid DKIM-Signature header field.

   The domain used in the HTTP or HTTPS URI MUST align with the domain
   used in the "d=" tag of the valid DKIM-Signature header field in
   which the headers are included in the "h=" tag.

7.  Examples

7.1.  Simple

   Header in Email

List-Unsubscribe: <https://example.com/unsubscribe.html>
List-Unsubscribe-Post: List-Unsubscribe=One-Click&recip=user@example.com

   Resulting POST request

   POST /unsubscribe.html HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
   Content-Length: 49

   List-Unsubscribe=One-Click&recip=user@example.com

7.2.  Complex

   Header in Email

 List-Unsubscribe: <mailto:listrequest@example.com?subject=unsubscribe>,
     <https://example.com/unsubscribe.html?campaign=123456789>
 List-Unsubscribe-Post: List-Unsubscribe=One-Click

Internet-Draft            One click unsubscribe                July 2016


   Resulting POST request

   POST /unsubscribe.html?campaign=123456789 HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
   Content-Length: 49

   List-Unsubscribe=One-Click&recip=user@example.com

8.  Security Considerations

   The List-Unsubscribe-Post header will typically contain the recipient
   address, but that address is usually also in the To: header.  This
   specification allows anyone with access to a message to unsubscribe
   the recipient of the message, but that's typically the case with
   existing List-Unsubscribe, just with more steps.
