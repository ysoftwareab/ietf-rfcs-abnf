      A Subregistry for urn:service:sos.police, fire and ambulance
             draft-rosen-ecrit-service-urn-subregistries-00

Abstract

   In most countries, there are multiple kinds of police forces.
   RFC5031 defines a "Service URN" which is used to route emergency
   calls.  The urn has a sub registry for different kinds of emergency
   services that may be reached from different telephone numbers or
   service numbers (as opposed to a single number like 112).  In many
   countries, the "police" service is not a single service, but more
   than one service where the service area and/or types of emergencies
   they respond to are different.  In some countries there are multiple
   ambulance services.  This document defines sub registries for
   urn:service:sos.police, urn:service:sos.ambulance and, for
   completeness, urn:service:sos.fire.  It also provides an initial set
   of entries for these sub registries.  These services are in addition
   to the base urn:service:sos.police, etc. services.

1.  IANA Considerations

1.1.  Police Force Types

   This document extends the urn:service:sos.police to allow the type of
   police force.  The type of force is a token separated from
   urn:service.sos.police by a period.  The token names are suggestive
   of the names for different kinds of police forces but is not supposed
   to be the literal name of the force.

   IANA is requested to add a sub registry to the Service URN Labels
   under sos Sub-Services entitled sos.police Sub-Services.  The
   registry should have Service, Description and References as in the
   other sub registries for the service urn.  The Registration Procedure
   is Expert review.  The expert shall use the same criteria as the
   other urn:service:sos entries.  The initial values of the sub
   registry are:

1.2.  Ambulance Types

   This document extends the urn:service:sos.ambulance to allow the type
   of ambulance.  The type of service is a token separated from
   urn:service.sos.ambulance by a period.  The token names are
   suggestive of the names for different kinds of ambulance services but
   is not supposed to be the literal name of the service.

   IANA is requested to add a sub registry to the Service URN Labels
   under sos Sub-Services entitled sos.ambulance Sub-Services.  The
   registry should have Service, Description and References as in the
   other sub registries for the service urn.  The Registration Procedure
   is Expert review.  The expert shall use the same criteria as the
   other urn:service:sos entries.  The initial values of the sub
   registry are:

   +---------+------------+--------------------------------------------+

1.3.  Fire Types

   This document extends the urn:service:sos.fire to allow the type of
   fire service.  The type of service is a token separated from
   urn:service.sos.fire by a period.  The token names are suggestive of
   the names for different kinds of fire services but is not supposed to
   be the literal name of the service.

   IANA is requested to add a sub registry to the Service URN Labels
   under sos Sub-Services entitled sos.fire Sub-Services.  The registry
   should have Service, Description and References as in the other sub
   registries for the service urn.  The Registration Procedure is Expert
   review.  The expert shall use the same criteria as the other
   urn:service:sos entries.  The initial values of the sub registry are:

   +----------+-----------+--------------------------------------------+
   | Service  | Reference | Description                                |
   +----------+-----------+--------------------------------------------+

2.  Security Considerations

   This document has the same security considerations as those in
   [RFC5031].

3.  Acknowledgements

   Ivo Sedlacek described the problem and attempted to register a
   service with a specific police force as distinct from
   urn:service:sos.police.  This work was inspired by his problem.
