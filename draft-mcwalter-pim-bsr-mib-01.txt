Internet-Draft                 PIM BSR MIB                     June 2006


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the
   Bootstrap Router (BSR) mechanism for PIM.  [I-D.ietf-pim-sm-v2-new],
   [I-D.ietf-pim-sm-bsr].

   This draft was created by the removal of BSR MIB support from the
   draft PIM MIB [I-D.ietf-pim-mib-v2].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   [RFC2578], STD 58, [RFC2579] and STD 58, [RFC2580].


3.  Overview

   This MIB module contains four tables.  The tables are:

   1.  The BSR Candidate-RP Table, which contains one row for each
       multicast group address prefix for which the local router is to
       advertise itself as a Candidate-RP.

   2.  The BSR RP-Set Table, which contains one row for each group
       mapping that was learned via BSR.

   3.  The BSR Candidate-BSR Table, which contains one roe for each
       Candidate-BSR configuration for the local router.

   4.  The BSR Elected BSR Table, which contains one row for each
       elected BSR.

   This MIB module uses textual conventions defined in the IF-MIB
   [RFC2863], the INET-ADDRESS-MIB [RFC4001] and the IANA-RTPROTO-MIB.

5.  Security Considerations

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   there is still no control over whom on the secure network is allowed
   to access (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT

Internet-Draft                 PIM BSR MIB                     June 2006


   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to access (read/change/create/delete) them.


6.  IANA Considerations

   PIM-BSR-MIB should be rooted under the mib-2 subtree.  IANA is
   requested to assign { mib-2 XXX } to the PIM-BSR-MIB module specified
   in this document.


7.  Acknowledgements

   This MIB module is based on the original work in
   [I-D.ietf-pim-mib-v2] by R. Sivaramu, J. Lingard and B. Joshi.

   Suggested IPv6 multicast MIBs by R. Sivaramu and R. Raghunarayan have
   been used for comparison while editing this MIB module.
