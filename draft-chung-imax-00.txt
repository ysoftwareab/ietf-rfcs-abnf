1. Introduction 
    
   This document outlines a set of extension mechanisms that would 
   enable the use of multilingual email addresses without disrupting the 
   services of the existing servers.  In brief, three main areas have 
   been enhanced to deal with multilingual addresses along with a 
   transition strategy: SMTP, Message Headers and POP. 
    
   All enhancements follow the guidelines of standard extension 
   mechanisms, thus SHOULD be deployable without affecting the 
   interoperability of mail services. 
    
1.1 Terminology 
    
   The key words "MUST", "SHALL", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "RECOMMENDED", 
   and "MAY" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 
   2119 [RFC2119]. 
    
   Throughout this document, multilingual characters intended to be 8-
   bit will be presented in the format (charset=hexvalue=hexvalue), 
   while 16-bit UCS-2 characters will be in the form (U+hex). 
    
    
2. SMTP Extensions for Multilingual Addresses 
    
   Following the SMTP Service Extension specifications defined in RFC 
   1869, a new EHLO keyword is introduced to facilitate the use of 
   multilingual email addresses for the transportation of messages. 
    
   Optional parameters are included to define the charset supported by 
   the server and that of the multilingual address.  To promote and 
   maintain the simplicity however, by default, a compliant server MUST 
   support UTF-8 as well as the IETF ASCII Compatible Encoding (ACE) 
   scheme as common for multilingual domain names (Section 5). 
    
2.1 Framework for Multilingual Extension 
    
  
Chung & Lam                                                    [Page 2] 
IMAX                                                      February 2003 
 
 
   The IMA extensions are defined as follows: 
    
   (1)  The textual name of the service extension defined is 
        ôInternationalized Mail Addressesö; 
    
   (2)  The EHLO Keyword value associated with the extension is ôIMAö; 
 
   (3)  The IMA EHLO Keyword supports as an optional parameter a space 
        separated list of charsets registered with IANA for use with 
        MIME, plus any ACE formats supported by the DNS; 
 
   (4)  No new SMTP verb is introduced; 
 
   (5)  A parameter using the keyword "CHARSET" is added to the MAIL 
        FROM and RCPT TO commands. 
    
   (6)  The clients and servers session would not be lengthened yet 
        multilingual characters could be used as mailbox identifiers.  
 
   (7)  The maximum line length of both the MAIL FROM and RCPT TO 
        commands SHOULD be increased by 1000 characters to provide for 
        the increased in length of the user name and domain name 
        because of multilingual encoding as well as for the optional 
        parameter "CHARSET". 
    
    
2.2 IMAX Compliant Sessions 
    
   Besides the new IMAX function, another service extension that would 
   be used to determine the handling of multilingual addresses is the 
   8bit-MIMEtransport extension [RFC1952].  If the server supports both, 
   the client should send a multilingual address in UTF-8.  If however 
   if the server only supports IMAX, then an ACE formatted name will be 
   used instead. 
    
   For example, a session between fully compliant clients and servers 
   would look like (C: = Client, S: = Server)(Please also be reminded 
   that characters intended to be 8-bit will be presented in the format: 
   charset=hexvalue=hexvalue): 
    
    
      S: <wait for connection on TCP port 25> 
      C: <open connection to server> 
      S: 220 mail.neteka.com -- Server SMTP (NeBOX v1.1) 
      C: EHLO mail.toronto.edu 
      S: 250-mail.neteka.com 
      S: 250-8BITMIME 
      S: 250 IMAX 
      C: MAIL FROM:<(UTF-8=E4=E8=AD=E6=96=87)@toronto.edu> CHARSET=UTF-8 
      S: 250 Address Ok. 
      C: RCPT TO:<edmon@neteka.com> 
      S: 250 edmon@neteka.com OK 
      C: DATA 
  
Chung & Lam                                                    [Page 3] 
IMAX                                                      February 2003 
 
 
      ... 
    
   If the server does not support 8BITMIME, then a 7-bit format must be 
   used: 
    
      C: EHLO mail.toronto.edu 
      S: 250-mail.neteka.com 
      S: 250 IMAX 
      C: MAIL FROM:<xn--3bhc2zmh@toronto.edu> CHARSET=ACE 
      S: 250 Address Ok. 
      ... 
    
   Should there be any negotiations on the supported CHARSET, any 
   unsupported CHARSET would result in a 504 error response, indicating 
   that the command parameter is not implemented. 
    
      C: EHLO mail.toronto.edu 
      S: 250-mail.neteka.com 
      S: 250-8BITMIME 
      S: 250 IMAX UTF-8 GB2312 
      C: MAIL FROM:<(Big5=A4=A4=A4=E5)@neteka.com> CHARSET=Big5 
      S: 504 command parameter not implemented 
      C: MAIL FROM:<(UTF-8=E4=E8=AD=E6=96=87)@neteka.com> CHARSET=UTF-8 
      S: 250 Address Ok. 
      ... 
    
   It is recommended in this document that the default encoding schemes 
   supported SHOULD be UTF-8 and an ACE format (that used by the DNS), 
   and both MUST be implemented for any server returning the IMAX EHLO 
   Keyword. 
    
       
2.3 CHARSET Parameter 
    
   While the CHARSET parameter for the IMAX EHLO Keyword is optional, 
   any IMAX compliant client MUST specify the charset used by including 
   the CHARSET parameter after the MAIL FROM or RCPT TO commands.  This 
   avoids the confusion caused by multiple conflicting character 
   encoding schemes. 
    
   If no charset is specified, the server SHOULD assume that the client 
   is not IMAX compliant and therefore attempt to resolve the incoming 
   user name correspondingly.  This however is beyond the scope of this 
   discussion. 
    
2.4 Client Side Fallback Strategy 
    
   There are different scenarios and level of compliancy for servers.  
   The basic one would be encountering a server that doesnÆt support 
   EHLO keywords or any SMTP service extensions.  In this case, the 
   client should attempt to send any multilingual names in an ACE 
   format. 
    
  
Chung & Lam                                                    [Page 4] 
IMAX                                                      February 2003 
 
 
      S: <wait for connection on TCP port 25> 
      C: <open connection to server> 
      S: 220 mail.example.com -- Server SMTP  
      C: EHLO mail.neteka.com 
      S: 500 Command not recognized: EHLO 
      C: HELO mail.neteka.com 
      S: 250 mail.example.com hello 
      C: MAIL FROM:<xn--3bhc2zmh@neteka.com> 
      S: 250 Address Ok. 
      ... 
    
   If a server supports EHLO but does not indicate that it also supports 
   IMAX, essentially the client should handle multilingual user names 
   the same way as encountering a non-EHLO aware server. 
    
      S: 220 mail.example.com -- Server SMTP  
      C: EHLO mail.neteka.com 
      S: 250-mail.neteka.com 
      S: 250 HELP 
      C: MAIL FROM:<xn--3bhc2zmh@neteka.com> 
      S: 250 Address Ok. 
      ... 
    
   The use of ACE names is purely for transitional purposes to ensure a 
   smooth and transparent migration towards multilingual enabled mail 
   address handling.  Eventually, mail clients and servers should 
   attempt to use the IMAX scheme with UTF8 for increased efficiency and 
   reduced confusion. 
    
3. Considerations for Inscription of Message Headers 
    
   In order for this transition to take place, additional message 
   headers are included to complement the SMTP IMAX scheme.  This 
   enables the tunneling of multilingual address information through 
   non-compliant servers and clients.  Compliant clients will therefore 
   utilize this information for display and further transportation 
   purposes, such as for reply. 
    
3.1 Denotation for Multilingual Header Fields 
    
   This document introduces a new set of message header fields (IMAX 
   Fields) by utilizing a prefix ôM-ö to indicate that the particular 
   field contains a multilingual address that corresponds to its main 
   field. 
    
   That is, a multilingual enabled field, or IMAX field complements any 
   field that contains a multilingual email address or domain name.  For 
   example the ôFrom:ö field would be complemented with ôM-From:ö if a 
   multilingual name were used. 
    
3.2 Encoding Schemes 
    

  
Chung & Lam                                                    [Page 5] 
IMAX                                                      February 2003 
 
 
   Since all the IMAX fields will be within the message header, the 
   encoding schema SHOULD follow that specified in RFC 2047.  That is, 
   both the Base64 as well as Quoted-Printable schemes should be 
   supported. 
    
   In addition, an ACE format SHOULD be supported. 
    
3.3 Implementation 
    
   Regardless of the format used for the SMTP handshaking process, the 
   message header fields should be consistent.  The only difference 
   would be the encoding scheme used during the transportation. 
    
   The encoding specified by the CHARSET parameter will be reflected by 
   the string used for the M-From: field.  For example, with the 
   following session: 
    
      S: 220 mail.neteka.com -- Server SMTP (NeBOX v1.1) 
      C: EHLO mail.toronto.edu 
      S: 250-mail.neteka.com 
      S: 250-8BITMIME 
      S: 250 IMAX 
      C: MAIL FROM:<(Big5=A4=A4=A4=E5)@toronto.edu> CHARSET=Big5 
      S: 250 Address Ok. 
      C: RCPT TO:<(Big5=A4=A4=A4=E5)@neteka.com> CHARSET=Big5 
      S: 250 (Big5=A4=A4=A4=E5)@neteka.com OK 
      C: DATA 
      ... 
    
   The resulting header field SHOULD include: 
    
    From: =?big5?B?pKSk5Q==?= <xn--3bhc2zmh@toronto.edu> 
    M-From:<=?big5?B?pKSk5Q==?=@toronto.edu> 
    
   Because of this, all IMAX fields will be inserted either by the SMTP 
   server or by the client after finishing all RCPT TO commands and just 
   before it sends the message out using the DATA command. 
    
   Note that the original ôFromö field utilizes ACE as the encoding for 
   the multilingual email address.  This is done to ensure that mail 
   will be processed and replied properly even if the receiving end is 
   using a non-compliant client / server. 
    
   Within the ôFrom:ö field, the nickname portion currently already 
   supports the message header encoding schemes specified in RFC 2047, 
   therefore should be displayed correctly. 
    
   In general, for implementation, all servers advertising that they 
   support IMAX MUST be able to insert the IMAX fields, while clients 
   SHOULD attempt to do so.  In practice therefore, when encountering a 
   multilingual address, the SMTP server MUST check incoming mail to see 
   whether any IMAX fields were included.  If so, it will not attempt to 
   check them further, but will trust the client.  However, if IMAX 
  
Chung & Lam                                                    [Page 6] 
IMAX                                                      February 2003 
 
 
   fields were not detected, and the incoming mail do contain 
   multilingual address(es), then the SMTP server MUST accurately 
   include all relevant IMAX fields. 
    
3.4 Compatibility Issues 
    
   The addition of these IMAX ôM-ö fields should not disrupt any mail 
   clients as they will be ignored.  However, compliant clients could 
   utilize them to correctly display the multilingual addresses, and 
   also be able to definitively respond to them. 
    
   The use of the well established encoding schemes supported by MIME 
   also means that it would be easier for mail clients to adopt this 
   IMAX extension for message headers. 
    
4. POP Capabilities Extension for Multilingual User Names 
    
   While SMTP takes care of the transportation of messages and the 
   header fields correspond to the display management by the clients, 
   POP essentially handles the retrieval of mail objects from the server 
   by a client. 
    
   In order to use multilingual user names for the retrieval of messages 
   from a mail server using the POP protocol, a new capability is 
   introduced following the POP3 extension mechanism [RFC 2449]. 
    
4.1 IMAX Capability 
    
   (1)  CAPA tag:  
           IMAX 
    
   (2)  Arguments: 
           CHARSET û a space separated list of charsets registered with 
        IANA for use with MIME 
 
   (3)  Standard commands affected:  
           USER and APOP 
 
   (4)  Announced states / possible differences: 
           AUTHENTICATION / none 
 
   (5)  Commands valid in states: 
           AUTHENTICATION 
 
   (6)  Specification Reference: 
           This document 
 
   (7)  Discussion: 
        The IMAX capability indicates that the POP server is 
        multilingual aware and is able to handle multilingual user 
        addresses.  Further discussion in Section 4.2. 
    
4.2 The IMAX process 
  
Chung & Lam                                                    [Page 7] 
IMAX                                                      February 2003 
 
 
    
   The IMAX capability enables the POP server to successfully handle 
   multilingual user names, which form a crucial part of a multilingual 
   email address.  The IMAX capability supports optional arguments 
   specifying the charsets supported by the POP server. 
    
   By default, similar to that specified in Section 2.2, any POP server 
   advertising that it supports IMAX MUST at least support UTF-8 and an 
   ACE format used by the DNS.  Other charsets may be included and could 
   be advertised using a space-separated list as an argument for the 
   IMAX CAPA keyword. 
    
   For example, a POP session between IMAX compliant servers and clients 
   would follow: 
    
      S: <wait for connection on TCP port 110> 
      C: <open connection to server> 
      S: +OK POP3 server ready 
      C: CAPA 
      S: +OK Capability list follows 
      S: TOP 
      S: USER 
      S: IMAX 
      S: . 
    
   Again, there will be different levels of compliance for POP servers.  
   If the POP3 extension mechanism is not at all supported, then the 
   CAPA command would yield a -ERR response, which indicates that this 
   is not an IMAX aware server.  Since it is necessary for POP servers 
   to be IMAX aware to host multilingual addresses however, a client 
   could assume that the POP server is non-compliant if a CAPA command 
   results in an ûERR response. 
    
   An IMAX compliant client MUST include the additional CHARSET 
   parameter with the USER command if the name in question contains 
   extended characters. 
    
   When confronted with a charset that is not implemented, the server 
   will generate a -ERR response: 
 
      S: +OK POP3 server ready 
      C: CAPA 
      S: +OK Capability list follows 
      S: TOP 
      S: USER 
      S: IMAX UTF-8 GB2312 
      S: . 
      C: USER (Big5=A4=A4=A4=E5)@neteka.com CHARSET=Big5 
      S: -ERR CHARSET=big5 not implemented 
      C: USER (UTF-8=E4=E8=AD=E6=96=87)@neteka.com CHARSET=UTF-8 
      S: +OK welcome 
      ... 
    
  
Chung & Lam                                                    [Page 8] 
IMAX                                                      February 2003 
 
 
   The client must then fallback to using UTF-8 or those advertised by 
   the POP server as supported charsets. 
    
4.3 Fallback Strategy 
    
   Although it is a safe assumption to maintain that for a mail server 
   to be willing to handle multilingual addresses, it should be prepared 
   to update its POP servers to be IMAX aware, there really should be 
   little concern for any fallback strategy. 
    
   Nevertheless, it is possible to create provisions for this situation. 
   Should an IMAX aware client encounter a non-compliant POP server, it 
   could use an ACE formatted user name for login. 
    
   In essence, it means that it is possible to have a pure client based 
   solution without changing the mail servers at all.  Please find 
   further discussion in the IMAA (Internationalized Mail Addresses in 
   Applications) paper. 
    
5. Stringprep, Nameprep and Charprep Considerations 
    
   Stringprep, Nameprep or other string preparation considerations for 
   matching multilingual names are not discussed in this document.  
   Character equivalence preparations (Charprep) are also not discussed.  
   Please refer to the relevant documents for further information. 
    
6. IANA & Security Considerations 
    
   Within this document, there are a number of new commands and 
   parameters that will have to be included into their respective IANA 
   registry. 
    
6.1 SMTP Service Extension Considerations 
    
   For the SMTP service extensions, a new EHLO keyword ôIMAXö is 
   introduced with optional parameters being the supported charsets.  An 
   additional parameter ôCHARSETö is also added to the SMTP commands 
   ôMAIL FROMö and ôRCPT TOö to indicate the charset used during the 
   transportation. 
    
6.2 Message Header Considerations 
    
   In the Message Header, a new set of multilingual enabled fields is 
   introduced with the prefix ôM-ö.  Any field that contains a 
   multilingual email address would be complemented with a ôM-
   <fieldname>ô field.  For example, ôFrom:ö and ôM-Fromö. 
    
6.3 POP Capability Considerations 
    
   Finally, a new Capability is added as a POP extension.  The CAPA tag 
   ôIMAXö is introduced to indicate that it is multilingual compliant, 
   with optional parameters being, again the supported charsets.  

  
Chung & Lam                                                    [Page 9] 
IMAX                                                      February 2003 
 
 
   Similar to the SMTP arrangements, an additional parameter ôCHARSETö 
   is also appended to the POP commands ôUSERö and ôAPOPö. 
    
6.4 Security Considerations 
    
   This document does not discuss any security issues and is not 
   believed to raise any extra security problems not already existing 
   within the email systems.  In fact the promotion of the adoption of 
   the service extension mechanisms for both SMTP and POP could in turn 
   enhance the overall security of email messaging.
