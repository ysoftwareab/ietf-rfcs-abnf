1.  Introduction

     This memo describes a simple mechanism to implement provider
     provisioned Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) [1] using Radius [5]
     as the PE discovery protocol and L2TPv3 [3] as the control and data
     plane protocol.  Radius is deployed as described in [2], whereas
     L2TP is deployed as described in [4] with minor changes.

     An advantage of a directory (such as Radius) based discovery
     solution for provider based VPNs is that it doesn't require BGP
     implementation or configuration complexity in the PE routers and
     can be easily deployed also in inter-AS cases where the VPN sites
     are attached to PEs in more than one AS.  An advantage of Radius as
     a directory protocol is that it has been in Internet-wide use for
     years and can thus be deployed without a new directory
     infrastructure.

     A similar directory based VPLS solution could be specified that
     uses LDP for signaling and MPLS label stack encapsulation for data
     transport. An L2TP based solution may, however, be preferable to
     providers who are already familiar with L2TP and are not deploying
     MPLS.  An L2TP based solution may also be considered simpler to
     manage, because L2TP tunnels are bidirectional and because L2TP
     bundles control, data, and management planes in a single protocol.

2.  Service Description

     This memo supports VPLS service in a mode where each VPLS instance
     (also called VPN for short) connects one or more CEs (also called
     VPN sites) to a common virtual LAN.  A VPN site can use either
     802.1q tagged or untagged (but not both) Ethernet frames to
     communicate with the other sites of the VPN.  In case of tagged



Heinanen                    Expires July 2004                   [Page 2]

Internet-Draft           Radius/L2TP Based VPLS             January 2004


     frames, each VPN site MUST use a single VLAN ID for the same VPN,
     but the VLAN ID MAY differ at each VPN site.

     VPLS service MAY support Differentiated Services treatment of
     tagged or untagged Ethernet frames.  In case of tagged frames, the
     desired treatment of the frame is coded in the 802.1p User Priority
     field.  In case of untagged frames, all frames sent by a site
     receive a default treatment.  Differentiated Services treatment as
     well as mapping of 802.1p User Priority values to DiffServ code
     points of L2TP tunnels is VPLS specific and outside the scope of
     this memo.

3.  Adding a Site to a VPN

3.1.  Configuration Actions

     A site (a CE) is added to a VPN (a VPLS instance) by adding its
     "user name", password, and VPN identifier record, for example:

          <SiteX@vpnY.domainZ.net, secret, vpnY.domainZ.net>

     to Radius database as described in [2].  After this configuration
     action the site can be connected to the VPN at a PE.

4.  Connecting a Site to a VPN

4.1.  Configuration Actions

     No configuration actions are needed if a site connects to the VPN
     at a PE using a dynamic authentication protocol, such as
     801.1x/EAP.  Otherwise, the Ethernet interface of the PE to which
     the site is going to be connected to MUST be configured with the
     "user name" and password of the site, for example:

          <providerP/SiteX@vpnY.domainZ.net, secret>

     The provider prefix is only needed in case the site is connected to
     a PE of a provider that is not the administrative owner of the VPN
     (providerP in the above example).

     The interface to which the site is connected to MAY be 802.1Q
     tagged or untagged.  In the former case, the VLAN ID that is used
     to connect the site to the VPN MUST be specified.

4.2.  Protocol Actions

     The following protocol actions take place at the PE when a new VPN
     site tries to authenticate itself with the PE or when the provider



Heinanen                    Expires July 2004                   [Page 3]

Internet-Draft           Radius/L2TP Based VPLS             January 2004


     has configured a new VPN site to the PE:

     (1)  The PE issues Radius Access-Request for the CE as described in
          [2].  If access is granted, the PE learns the identifier of
          the CE's VPN and IP addresses of the VPN's PEs.

     (2)  If the PE already has site(s) that belong to the same VPN as
          the new site, no other protocol actions take place at the PE.

     (3)  Otherwise the PE establishes an L2TP Control Connection with
          each of the other PEs of the VPN unless one already exists.
          The Pseudo Wire Capabilities List AVP of the Control
          Connection MUST contain this and only this value:

               0xTBD - Sessions without control word for connecting
                       Ethernet VLANs are allowed


     (4)  The PE establishes for this VPN an L2TP session with each of
          the remote PEs unless one already exists.  L2TP sessions are
          established as defined in section 2.2 of [4] with the
          following changes and clarifications:

          L2TP sessions are established as for Incoming Calls using
          ICRQ/ICRP/ICCN message exchange (see section 3.4.1 of [3]).

          The Pseudo Wire Type AVP MUST have in its Attribute Value
          field value:

               0xTBD - Ethernet VLAN

          The Application ID AVP MUST have in its Application Code field
          value:

               0xTBD - Radius/L2TP based VPLS

          The End Identifier AVP MUST have in its Attribute Value field
          the domain name of the VPN:

           0                   1                   2                   3
           0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
          |  VPN Identifier (e.g. vpnY.domainZ.net) ...
          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

     The following protocol actions take place in sequence at a PE when
     it receives an L2TP Incoming-Call-Request from another PE for the
     application described in this document:



Heinanen                    Expires July 2004                   [Page 4]

Internet-Draft           Radius/L2TP Based VPLS             January 2004


     (1)  The PE checks that itself and the other PE belong to the VPN
          indicated by the End Identifier AVP.  If the other PE is not
          included in the PE's current list of other PEs of the VPN, the
          PE issues an Access-Request request for an up to date list.
          If the check fails, the PE responds with a Call-Disconnect-
          Notify and no other protocol actions take place at the PE.

          The Call-Disconnect-Notify MUST include a Result Code AVP with
          Error Code and Error Message fields.  The Result Code MUST
          have the value 0x0002 (Session disconnected for the reason
          indicated in Error Code) and the <Error Code, Error Message>
          MUST have one of the two values:

               <0xTBD, "Requesting PE does not belong to the VPN">
               <0xTBD, "Requested PE does not belong to the VPN">


     (2)  The PE checks if it already has an L2TP session with the
          calling PE for the VPN indicated by the End Identifier AVP.
          If so, the PE responds with a Call-Disconnect-Notify and no
          other protocol actions take place at the PE.

          The Call-Disconnect-Notify MUST include a Result Code AVP with
          Error Code and Error Message fields. The Result Code MUST have
          the value 0x0002 (Session disconnected for the reason
          indicated in Error Code) and the <Error Code, Error Message>
          MUST have the value:

               <0xTBD, "Session already exists for the VPN">


     (3)  Otherwise the PE accepts the request with an Incoming-Call-
          Reply.

5.  Disconnecting a Site from a VPN

5.1.  Configuration Actions

     When a site (CE) is to be disconnected from a VPN at a PE the "user
     name" and password of the site is unconfigured from the Ethernet
     interface to which it has been connected to.

5.2.  Protocol Actions

     The following protocol actions take place in sequence at the PE of
     the disconnected site:





Heinanen                    Expires July 2004                   [Page 5]

Internet-Draft           Radius/L2TP Based VPLS             January 2004


     (1)  The PE issues a Stop Accounting-Request as described in 5.3 of
          [2].

     (2)  If the disconnected site was the last site of the VPN at the
          PE, the PE tears down any existing L2TP sessions for the VPN
          by sending each remote PE a Call-Disconnect-Notify.

          The Call-Disconnect-Notify MUST include a Result Code AVP with
          Error Code and Error Message fields.  The Result Code MUST
          have the value 0x0002 (Session disconnected for the reason
          indicated in Error Code) and the <Error Code, Error Message>
          MUST have the value:

               <0xTBD, "Requesting PE does not anymore belong to the VPN">

     When a PE receives a Call-Disconnect-Notify from another PE for the
     application described in this memo, no other protocol actions than
     normal clean up of the corresponding L2TP session are needed at the
     PE.

     If the L2TP session that was torn down between two PEs was the last
     session associated with the Control Connection, either PE MAY tear
     down the Control Connection.

6.  Removing a Site from a VPN

6.1.  Configuration Actions

     A site (a CE) is removed from a VPN (a VPLS instance) by removing
     its

          <CE user name, password, VPN identifier>

     record from Radius database.  This configuration action MUST
     succeed only if Radius does not have a

          <VPN identifier, PE IP address, CE user name>

     record in its database where CE user name belongs to the removed
     CE.  This is true if the site has been first disconnected from the
     VPN as described in section 5.

7.  Failure Recovery

     If a PE loses its Control Connection with another PE having site(s)
     in a common VPN, the PE tries to re-establish the Control
     Connection until (a) the Control Connection gets re-established or
     (b) this PE or the other PE no longer have site(s) in this VPN.



Heinanen                    Expires July 2004                   [Page 6]

Internet-Draft           Radius/L2TP Based VPLS             January 2004


     Once the Control Connection gets re-established, the PE re-
     establishes an L2TP session with the other PE for this VPN as
     described in section 4.2.

     If an L2TP session gets teared down between two PEs and they still
     have site(s) in the VPN of the teared down session, the two PEs try
     to re-establish the session as described in section 4.2 as long as
     the two PEs have site(s) in the VPN of the teared down session.

     When a PE recovers from a crash, it adds each of the configured VPN
     site(s) to their respective VPN(s) as described in section 4.2.

8.  Exponential Back-off Behavior

     If any protocol action does not succeed immediately, normal
     behavior is that the PE keeps on trying with exponential back-off
     until the action either succeeds or becomes invalid due to a change
     in VPN configuration.  If the protocol action fails for an
     implementation specific prolonged period of time, the PE SHOULD
     notify the "owner" of the VPN about the problem via a management
     action.

9.  Data Plane

     The PEs that host the sites of a VPN act as virtual, fully
     connected learning bridges for the VPN.

     When a PE receives a Ethernet frame from a CE for a particular VPN,
     it adds to it a 802.1q tag (if not already present) and sets the
     VLAN ID to zero.  Treatment of the 802.1p User Priority field is
     VPLS specific and outside the scope of this memo.

     When a PE needs to send an Ethernet frame to a VPN site connected
     to it, it either overwrites the VLAN ID with the VLAN ID used by
     the site for this VPN or removes the 802.1q tag if the interface of
     the VPN site is untagged.  Treatment of the 802.1p User Priority
     field is VPLS specific and outside the scope of this memo.

     When a PE needs to send an Ethernet frame to another PE, the PE
     processes the frame as described in section 3 of [4] using the L2TP
     session established for this VPLS instance.  Mapping of the 802.1p
     User priority value to DiffServ code point of the L2TP packet is
     VPLS specific and outside the scope of this memo.

10.  Security Considerations

     Security of Radius/L2TP based VPNs depends on security of Radius
     and L2TP.  Security of Radius is covered in section 8 or [5] and

     security of L2TP is covered in section 8 of [3].
