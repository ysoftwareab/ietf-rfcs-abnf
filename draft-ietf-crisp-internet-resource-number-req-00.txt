Internet Draft   crisp-internet-resource-number-requirements   July 2003


1. Introduction

1.1 Background

   The expansion and growth of the Internet has seen the registry 
   function of a traditionally centralized and managed Network 
   Information Center become the responsibility of various autonomous, 
   functionally disparate, and globally distributed Internet registries.
   With the broadening number of Internet registries, the uses of their 
   administrative directory services have expanded from the original and
   traditional use of the whois [5] protocol to include the use of whois
   outside the scope of its specification, formal and informal 
   definitions of syntax, undocumented security mechanisms, the use of 
   other protocols, such as rwhois [4], to fulfill other needs, and 
   proposals for the use of other technologies such as LDAP [3] and XML.
   
1.2 Requirements Scope

   The scope of the requirements captured in this document relate to the
   directory services of Internet resource number registries and their 
   related communities (Section 2.1 and Section 2.2).  Additional 
   communities are described in the Cross Registry Internet Service 
   Protocol (CRISP) Requirements draft [6]. These requirements are not 
   specific to any protocol.  Terms used in the definition of the
   requirements in this document may be found in the glossary 
   (Appendix A).
   
   The scope of the requirements in this document is also restricted to 
   access of data from Internet registries.  Requirements for 
   modification, addition, or provisioning of data in Internet 
   registries are out of scope.

1.3 Requirements Specification

   The requirements captured in this document are for the purpose of 
   designing technical specifications.  The words used in this document 
   for compliance with RFC2119 [2] do not reference or specify policy 
   and speak only to the capabilities in the derived technology.  For 
   instance, this document may say that the protocol "MUST" support 
   certain features.  An actual service operator is always free to 
   disable it (and then to return an error such as "permission denied".)

   Requirements in this document specifying the capabilities of the 
   protocol required for proper interaction between a client and a 
   server will be specified with the "MUST/SHOULD" language of RFC2119 
   [2].  This document also contains language relating to the 
   interaction of a client with multiple servers to form a coherent, 
   cross-network service.  Such service requirements will not be 
   described using RFC2119 language.

   While individual servers/service operators may not support all 
   features that the protocol can support, they must respect the 
   semantics of the protocol queries and responses.  For example, a 
   server should not return referrals if it does not have referent data.

2. Internet Registry Communities

   The Internet registries are composed of various communities which 
   provide scope for the requirements in this document.  This document 
   describes those communities specifically involved with Internet 
   resource number registration.  Other communities are described in the
   Cross Registry Internet Service Protocol (CRISP) Requirements draft 
   [6]. These descriptions are provided in this document for 
   informational purposes only. 

2.1 Regional Internet Registries

   Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) administer the allocation of IP 
   address space and autonomous system numbers.  Each RIR serves 
   specific geographic regions, and collectively they service the entire
   Internet.  Each RIR is a membership-based, non-profit organization 
   that facilitates and implements addressing policy based on the 
   direction of their regional community.
   
2.2 Other Internet Registries

   Local Internet Registries (LIRs), National Internet Registries (NIRs)
   and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are registries of the RIRs and 
   coordinate the same functions of the RIRs for smaller, more specific
   geographic regions, sovereign nations, localities, and business
   regions.

3. Functional Requirements

   Functional requirements describe an overall need or process for which
   the directory service is used by an Internet registry to fulfill its 
   obligations to provide information about their customers, members and
   the resources they hold.  This section describes requirements in the 
   manner specified in Section 1.3.

3.1 Base Functions

   This section describes basic directory service protocol requirements 
   for Internet registries.  Additional requirements, specific to 
   Internet resource number registries, are described in Internet 
   Resource Number Specific Functions (Section 3.2).

3.1.1 Mining Prevention

   In order to prevent the inappropriate acquisition of data from an 
   Internet registry's directory service, servers may limit the amount 
   of data that may be returned in a fixed time period from a server to 
   a client.  This will most likely be especially true for anonymous 
   access uses (see Section 3.1.4).

   The limits placed on differing types of data or applied depending 
   upon access status will most likely differ from server to server 
   based on policy and need.  Support for varying service models in the 
   effort to limit data and prevent data mining may or may not have a 
   direct impact on the client-to-server protocol, but MUST NOT be 
   prevented by the protocol.

3.1.2 Minimal Technical Reinvention

   The protocol MUST NOT employ unique technology solutions for all 
   aspects and layers above the network and transport layers and SHOULD 
   make use of existing technology standards where applicable.  The 
   protocol MUST employ the use of network and transport layer standards
   as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force.  The protocol MUST
   define one or more transport mechanisms for mandatory implementation.
   
3.1.3 Standard and Extensible Schemas

3.1.3.1 Protocol Requirement

   The protocol MUST contain standard schemas for the exchange of data 
   needed to implement the functionality in this document.  In addition,
   there MUST be a means to allow the use of schemas not defined by the 
   needs of this document.  Both types of schemas MUST use the same 
   schema language.  The schemas MUST be able to express data elements 
   with identifying tags for the purpose of localization of the meaning 
   of the identifying tags.

Internet Draft   crisp-internet-resource-number-requirements   July 2003


3.1.3.2 Service Description

   The client-to-server protocol must define a standard set of data 
   structures or schemas to be used when exchanging information.  It 
   must also possess the ability to allow for the use of newer data 
   structures that are currently nor foreseen by this specification.  In
   both cases, the description and specification of both types of data 
   structures or schemas must be done in the same way (i.e. the same 
   schema language).
   
   The schemas must also be capable of "tagging" data with a unique 
   identifier.  This identifier can then be used to localize the name of
   that type of data.  For instance, a piece of data may have the value 
   "Bob" and its type identified with the number "5.1".  Client software
   could use this to display "Name: Bob" in an English locale or 
   "Nombre: Bob" in a Spanish locale.

3.1.4 Level of Access

3.1.4.1 Protocol Requirement

   The protocol MUST NOT prohibit an operator from granularly assigning 
   multiple types of access to data according to the policies of the 
   operator.  The protocol MUST provide an authentication mechanism and 
   MUST NOT prohibit an operator from granting types of access based on 
   authentication.

   The protocol MUST provide an anonymous access mechanism that may be 
   turned on or off based on the policy of an operator.
   
3.1.4.2 Service Description

   Server operators may offer varying degrees of access depending on 
   policy and need.  The following are some examples:

   o  users may be allowed access only to data for which they have a
      relationship

   o  unauthenticated or anonymous access status may not yield any
      contact information

   o  full access may be granted to a special group of authenticated
      users

   The types of access allowed by a server will most likely vary from 
   one operator to the next.

3.1.5 Client Processing

   The protocol MUST be capable of allowing machine parsable requests 



Listman, Editor        Expires January 25, 2004                 [Page 8]

Internet Draft   crisp-internet-resource-number-requirements   July 2003


   and responses.

3.1.6 Entity Referencing

   There MUST be a mechanism for an entity contained within a server to 
   be referenced uniquely by an entry in another server.

3.1.7 Decentralization

3.1.7.1 Protocol Requirement

   The protocol MUST NOT require the aggregation of data to a central 
   repository, server, or entity.  The protocol MUST NOT require 
   aggregation of data indexes or hints to a central repository, server,
   or entity.

3.1.7.2 Service Description

   Some server operators may have a need to coordinate service in a mesh
   or some other framework with other server operators.  However, the 
   ability to operate a CRISP compliant server must not require this.

3.1.8 Authentication Distribution

3.1.8.1 Protocol Requirement

   The protocol MUST NOT require any Internet registry to participate in
   any authentication system.  The protocol MUST NOT prohibit the 
   participation by an Internet registry in federated, distributed 
   authentication systems.

3.1.8.2 Service Description

   Some server operators may have a need to delegate authentication to 
   another party or participate in a system where authentication 
   information is distributed.  However, the ability to operate a CRISP 
   compliant server must not require this.

3.1.9 Base Error Responses

   The protocol MUST be capable of returning the following types of non-
   result or error responses to all lookups and searches:

   o  permission denied - a response indicating that the search or
      lookup has failed due to insufficient authorization.

   o  not found - the desired results do not exist.

   o  insufficient resources - the search or lookup requires resources
      that cannot be allocated.

Internet Draft   crisp-internet-resource-number-requirements   July 2003


3.1.10 Query Distribution

3.1.10.1 Protocol Requirement

   The protocol MUST NOT prohibit a server from participating in a query
   distribution system.

3.1.10.2 Service Description

   For lookups and searches requiring distribution of queries, the 
   client must be allowed to distribute these queries among the 
   participants in an established mesh of server operators.  It is not a
   requirement that the protocol enable the discovery of servers, but 
   cooperating servers should be able to intelligently handle 
   distribution with its established mesh.  Individual server operators 
   will respond to all queries received according to their policies for 
   authentication, privacy, and performance.

   However, the ability to operate a CRISP compliant server must not 
   require the participation in any query distribution system.

3.1.11 Protocol and Schema Versioning

3.1.11.1 Protocol Requirements

   The protocol MUST provide a means by which the end-systems can either
   identify or negotiate over the protocol version to be used for any 
   query or set of queries.

   All resource-specific schemas MUST provide version identifier 
   attributes which uniquely and unambiguously identifies the version of
   the schema being returned in the answer set to a query.

3.1.11.2 Service Description

   The service should allow end-systems using different protocol 
   versions to fallback to a mutually supported protocol version.  If 
   this is not possible, the service must provide a meaningful error 
   which indicates that this is the specific case.

   The service must suggest negotiation and/or recovery mechanisms for 
   clients to use when an unknown schema version is received.

3.2 Internet Resource Number Specific Functions

   These functions describe requirements specifically needed by Regional
   Internet Registries (Section 2.1). No compliant server operator is 
   required to support the functions required by every registry type.

3.2.1 Lookups

Internet Draft   crisp-internet-resource-number-requirements   July 2003


   Lookups are queries by unique identifiers resulting in zero or one
   match.

3.2.1.1 Protocol Requirement

   The protocol MUST be able to query for information relating to the
   following kinds of objects:

   1. IPv4 network address(es)

   2. IPv6 network address(es)

   3. Autonomous system number(s)

   4. Contact

   5. Organization

   See Section 3.2.3 for the requirements regarding the expected return 
   values.

3.2.1.2 Service Description

   These lookups are all single index queries, have a unique identifier
   and should produce zero or only one entity.

   Depending on the policy and need of an Internet registry, a server 
   operator may not allow all or any of these lookups to return part or 
   all of the information.  See Section 3.2.3.

3.2.2 Searches

   Searches are queries by attributes that may not be unique resulting 
   in zero, one or many matches.

3.2.2.1 Protocol Requirement

   The protocol MUST contain the following search functions:

   1. IPv4 address search given one or more contiguous IP address
      numbers. This search SHOULD allow for both exact matching and
      nested matching.

   2. IPv6 address search given one or more contiguous IP address
      numbers. This search SHOULD allow for both exact matching and
      nested matching.

   3. Autonomous system number search given one or more contiguous 
      numbers. This search SHOULD allow for both exact matching and
      nested matching.

Internet Draft   crisp-internet-resource-number-requirements   July 2003


   4. Contact search by either exact name or partial name matching.

   5. Organization search by either exact name or partial name matching.

   See Section 3.2.3 for the requirements regarding the expected return 
   values.

3.2.2.2 Service Description

   These searches may be multi-index queries and may produce zero, one 
   or many entities.

   Depending on the policy and need of an Internet registry, a server 
   operator may not allow all or any of these searches to return part or
   all of the information.  See Section 3.1.4.  Access to information 
   resulting from these searches may also be limited, depending on 
   policy, by quantity.  Section 3.2.5 describes these types of 
   restrictions.

   Some Internet registries may also be participating in a query 
   distribution system.  See Section 3.1.10.

3.2.3 Information Sets

3.2.3.1 Protocol Requirements

   The data sets for networks, autonomous systems, contacts, and 
   organizations MUST be able to express and represent the attributes 
   and allowable values of registered Internet resource number 
   registration and provisioning protocols.

   The data set for networks, autonomous systems, organizations and 
   contacts MUST be able to express arbitrary textual information for 
   extensions on an individual operator basis.  Examples of such 
   information are authorized use policies, extended status 
   notifications, marketing/for sale notices, and URI references to 
   other sources.

3.2.3.1.1 IP Address Network Return Values

   The schema MUST be capable of expressing the following information 
   for IP address networks:

   o  range of IP addresses

   o  network type, for example, allocated or assigned

   o  last updated date

3.2.3.2 Service Description
   It is not expected that every Internet registry supply all of the 
   information spelled out above, however the schemas employed by the 
   protocol must be capable of expressing this information should a 
   registry need to provide it.

   The following sections describe requirements relative to the use of 
   schemas with respect to individual registry need and policy:

   o  Section 3.2.6

   o  Section 3.2.4

   o  Section 3.1.4

   o  Section 3.1.1

3.2.4 Result Set Limits

3.2.4.1 Protocol Requirement

   The protocol MUST contain a feature, used at the discretion of a 
   server operator, to allow a server to express to a client a limit on 
   the number of results from searches and lookups.  When returning 
   result sets, the protocol MUST be able to make the following 
   distinctions:

   1. an empty result set.

   2. a result set truncated for the purpose of improving performance
      bottlenecks.

   3. a result set truncated to comply with Section 3.1.1

3.2.4.2 Service Description

   Client software will operate more usefully if it can understand 
   reasons for the truncation of result sets.  Of course, some Internet 
   registries may not be able to expose their policies for the limiting 
   of result sets, but, when it is possible, clients will have a better 
   operational view.  This may eliminate re-queries and other repeated 
   actions that are not desirable.

3.2.5 Distribution for Internet Resource Number Registry Types

3.2.5.1 Protocol Requirement

   The protocol MUST NOT prohibit the distribution of data to exclude

Internet Draft   crisp-internet-resource-number-requirements   July 2003


   any of the registry types stated in Section 2.  The protocol MUST be
   capable of expressing referrals and entity references between the 
   various registry types described in Section 2.

3.2.5.2 Service Description

   An RIR will allocate IP address space to those registration entities 
   described in Section 2.2.  These entities may be given the option to
   store utilization within the RIR database, or establish their own
   server to be referenced as needed.  If the entity establishes their
   own server, it must comple with the requirements of this document.

3.2.6 Data Omission

3.2.6.1 Protocol Requirement

   When a value in an answer to a query cannot be given due to policy 
   constraints, the protocol MUST be capable of expressing the value in 
   one of three ways:

   1. complete omission of the value without explanation

   2. an indication that the value cannot be given due to insufficient 
      authorization

   3. an indication that the value cannot be given due to privacy 
      constraints regardless of authorization status

   The protocol MAY define other values for this purpose, but MUST  
   define values defined above at a minimum.

3.2.6.2 Service Description

   Internet registries will have varying constraints regarding their 
   ability to expose certain types of data.  Server operators must have 
   the ability to accommodate this need while client software will be
   more useful when provided with proper explanations.  Therefore,
   depending on policy, a server operator has a choice between not
   returning the data at all, signaling a permission error, or 
   indicating a privacy constraint.

3.2.7 Internationalization

   The schema defining Internet number related resources MUST conform to
   RFC 2277 [1] regarding textual data.  In particular, the schema MUST
   be able to indicate the charset and language in use with unstructured
   textual data.

   The protocol MAY be able to support multiple representations of 
   contact data, with these representations complying with the

   requirements in Section 3.2.3.  The protocol MUST be able to provide 
   contact data in UTF-8 and SHOULD be able to provide contact data in 
   US-ASCII, other character sets, and capable of specifying the 
   language of the data.

3.2.8 Privacy

   The following sections describe requirements related to the privacy 
   of the data stored in the database:

   o Section 3.1.4

   o Section 3.1.1

4. Feature Requirements

   Feature requirements describe the perceived need derived from the 
   functional requirements for specific technical criteria of the 
   directory service.  This section describes requirements in the manner
   specified in Section 1.3.

4.1 Client Authentication

   Entities accessing the service (users) MUST be provided a mechanism 
   for passing credentials to a server for the purpose of 
   authentication.  The protocol MUST provide a mechanism capable of 
   employing many authentication types and capable of extension for 
   future authentication types.

4.2 Referrals

   To distribute queries for search continuations and to issue entity 
   references, the protocol MUST provide a referral mechanism.

4.3 Common Referral Mechanism

   To distribute queries for search continuations and to issue entity 
   references, the protocol MUST define a common referral scheme and 
   syntax.

4.4 Structured Queries and Responses

   To provide for machine consumption as well as human consumption, the 
   protocol MUST employ structured queries and responses.

5. Internationalization Considerations

   Requirements defined in this document MUST consider the best 
   practices spelled out in [1].

6. IANA Considerations

   IANA consideration for any service meeting these requirements will 
   depend upon the technologies chosen and MUST be specified by any 
   document describing such a service.

7. Security Considerations

   This document contains requirements for the validation of 
   authenticated entities and the access of authenticated entities 
   compared with the access of non-authenticated entities.  This 
   document does not define the mechanism for validation of 
   authenticated entities.  Requirements defined in this document MUST 
   allow for the implementation of this mechanism according best common 
   practices.

   The requirement in Section 3.1.4 must be weighed against other 
   requirements specifying search or lookup capabilities.

   This document contains requirements for referrals and entity 
   references.  Client implementations based on these requirements 
   SHOULD take proper care in the safe-guarding of credential 
   information when resolving referrals or entity references according 
   to best common practices.

   This document contains requirements for the distribution of queries 
   among a mesh of participating service providers.  Protocols proposed 
   to meet these requirements must be able to protect against the use of
   that distribution system as a vector of distributed denial of service
   attacks or unauthorized data mining.

Appendix A. Glossary

   o  contact data: Data containing names and contact information (i.e.
      postal addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses) of humans or
      legal entities.

   o  operational data: Data necessary to the operation of networks and
      network related services and items.

   o  RIR: Initials for "regional Internet registry."

   o  mining: In the context of this document, this term is specific to
      data mining.  This is a methodical process to obtain the contents
      of directory service, usually as much as possible, not relevant to
      any immediate operational Internet need.  Data mining is often not
      a practice welcomed by registry operators.
