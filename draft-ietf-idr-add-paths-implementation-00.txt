     Advertisement of Multiple Paths in BGP: Implementation Report
               draft-ietf-idr-add-paths-implementation-00

Abstract

   This document reports the results of an ADD-PATH implementation
   survey.  The survey had 22 questions about implementations' support
   for advertising multiple paths in BGP.  After a brief summary of the
   results, each response is listed.  This document contains responses
   from six implementers who completed the survey.

   The editor did not use external means to verify the accuracy of the
   information submitted by the respondents.  The respondents are
   considered experts on the products they reported on.

Internet-Draft       ADD-PATH Implementation Report        February 2015


1.  Introduction

   This document reports results from a survey of implementations of the
   Advertisement of Multiple Paths in BGP [I-D.ietf-idr-add-paths],
   where a BGP [RFC4271] extension that allows the advertisement of
   multiple paths for the same address prefix without the new paths
   implicitly replacing any previous ones is defined.  The essence of
   the extension is that each path is identified by a path identifier in
   addition to the address prefix.

   The ADD-PATH implementation survey had 22 detailed questions about
   compliance with [I-D.ietf-idr-add-paths].  Six implementers (Cumulus
   Networks, Cisco Systems, Exa Networks, Juniper Networks, Alcatel-
   Lucent and CZ.NIC) completed the survey.  Section 3.1 provides an
   overview of the differences between the implementations.  Section 4
   provides a compilation of the results.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Results of the Survey

   The respondents replied "Yes" or "No" to the survey's questions to
   indicate whether their implementation supports the Functionality/
   Description of the [RFC2119] language in [I-D.ietf-idr-add-paths].
   The respondents replied "Other" to indicate an alternate behavior and
   had the opportunity to provide comments in all cases.  Some questions
   were informative.

3.1.  Overview of Differences

   This section provides the reader with a shortcut to the points where
   the implementations differ.

   Two of the implementations work only in receive-mode; they don't
   implement any advertisement of routes.  Obviously, those
   implementations are not compliant with the sections related to the
   advertisement of routes.  Taking that fact into account, all the
   responders had consistent and compliant answers to all the sections
   of the survey.

4.  Implementation Report

   For every item listed, the respondents indicated whether their
   implementation supports the Functionality/Description or not (Yes/No)
   according to the [RFC2119] language indicated.  Any comments are
   included.  If appropriate, the respondents indicated with "Other" the
   fact that the support is neither Yes/No (an alternate behavior, for
   example).  Refer to the appropriate sections in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-add-paths] for additional details.

4.1.  Section 2: How to Identify a Path

4.1.1.  Base Behavior

   Functionality/Description: Is your implementation compatible with the
   use of the Path Identifier as described in this section?

   [RFC2119]: N/A

                   Implementation Yes/No/Other Comments
                   -------------- ------------ --------
                   Cumulus        Yes
                   Cisco          Yes
                   Exa            Yes
                   Juniper        Yes
                   ALU            Yes
                   CZ.NIC         Yes

4.1.2.  Path Identifier Assignment

   Functionality/Description: Explain how Path Identifiers are assigned
   in your implementation.

   [RFC2119]: N/A

   Implementation Comments
   -------------- ------------------------------------------------------
   Cumulus        quagga is RX only for now so this is not an issue
   Cisco          Each net has unique path-id per paths under it. The
                  path ids that are withdrawn can get assigned to the
                  newer paths.
   Exa            By the user
   Juniper        Incrementally assign an id based on the N+1 of the
                  max(N) of the path ids already assigned.
   ALU            Path IDs are per address family. Every new advertised
                  path uses the next available path ID (in sequential
                  order) for the address family.
   CZ.NIC         Each route source (like add_path-unaware BGP peer) has
                  allocated fixed path id.

4.1.3.  Path Identifier Assignment (2)

   Functionality/Description: "...the Path Identifier MUST be assigned
   in such a way that the BGP speaker is able to use the (prefix, path
   identifier) to uniquely identify a path advertised to a neighbor."

   Can your implementation uniquely identify an advertised path based on
   the (prefix, path identifier) pair?

   Juniper        Yes
   ALU            Yes
   CZ.NIC         Yes

4.1.4.  Route Re-advertisement

   Functionality/Description: "A BGP speaker that re-advertises a route
   MUST generate its own Path Identifier to be associated with the re-
   advertised route."

   Does your implementation generate a new Path Identifier when re-
   advertising a route?

   [RFC2119]: MUST

   Implementation Yes/No/Other Comments
   -------------- ------------ -----------------------------------------
   Cumulus        Other        Comments quagga does not support TX yet

   Juniper        Yes

   CZ.NIC         Other        New path_id is allocated for each unique
                               path_id received through add_path-aware
                               BGP session.

4.1.5.  Received Path Identifier

   Functionality/Description: "A BGP speaker that receives a route
   SHOULD NOT assume that the identifier carries any particular
   semantics; it SHOULD be treated as an opaque value."

   Does your implementation treat a received Path Identifier as an
   opaque value?

   [RFC2119]: SHOULD NOT

   Capability to the peer indicating its ability to send multiple paths
   for the <AFI, SAFI>, and also receives the ADD-PATH Capability from
   the peer indicating its ability to receive multiple paths for the
   <AFI, SAFI>..."

   Does your implementation follow normal procedures when generating
   UPDATES if the ADD-PATH capability is not sent and received?

   of the address prefix and the Path Identifier, and use the extended
   NLRI encodings specified in this document."

4.4.11.  Graceful Restart

   Functionality/Description: "...an implementation SHOULD take special
   care so that the underlying forwarding plane of a "Receiving Speaker"
   as described in [RFC4724] is not affected during the graceful restart
   of a BGP session."

   Please explain how your implementation addresses Graceful Restart.

   Cumulus        Quagga has partial GR support (it is GR aware for
                  other restarting nodes) but does not maintain the
                  forwarding plane during a restart.
   Cisco          XE-BGP-ADD-Paths need to have HA enhancements
   Exa            No FIB, not relevant
   Juniper        During BGP graceful restart procedures, the receiving
                  speaker ignores the path-id for purposes of
                  identifying a matching route.  Once a refreshed route
                  has been correlated to a previous path, the path-id is
                  updated.
   ALU            Graceful restart is supported for the receiving router
                  role so by definition graceful restart does not affect
                  the forwarding plane.
   CZ.NIC         FIB is not modified until initial graceful restart
                  phase is finished.
