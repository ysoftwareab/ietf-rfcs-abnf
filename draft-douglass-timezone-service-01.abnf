lang=<lang-code>  OPTIONAL, but MAY occur multiple times.
         Specifies the language or languages for localized information.

format=<media-type>  OPTIONAL, but MUST occur only once.  Return
         information using the specified media-type.  In the absence of
         this parameter, the value "text/calendar" MUST be assumed.

lang=<lang-code>  OPTIONAL, but MAY occur multiple times.  If
         present, specifies the language or languages for localized
         information.
tzid=<identifier>  REQUIRED, but MAY occur multiple times.
         Identifies the timezone for which information is returned.
         Alternatively, if a single value of "*" is given, returns
         information for all timezones.  The "*" option will typically
         be used by servers that wish to retrieve the entire set of
         timezones supported by another server to re-synchronize their
         entire data cache.  Clients will typically only retrieve
         individual timezone data on a case-by-case basis.

tzid=<identifier>  REQUIRED, but MAY occur multiple times.
         Identifies the timezones for which information is returned.
         The value "*", which has a special meaning in the "get"
         operation, is not supported by this operation.

lang=<lang-code>  OPTIONAL, but MAY occur multiple times.  If
         present, specifies the language or languages for localized
         information.

start=date or date-time:  OPTIONAL, but MUST occur only once.  If
         present, specifies the start of the period of interest.  If
         omitted, the current year is assumed.

end=date or date-time:  OPTIONAL, but MUST occur only once.  If
         present, specifies the end of the period of interest.  If
         omitted, the current year + 10 is assumed.
