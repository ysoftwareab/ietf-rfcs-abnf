Abstract

   An important component of presence services is policy. Policy systems
   allow the presentity to grant access to specific pieces of
   information to specific watchers. To allow for interoperability
   between clients which set such policies, and servers which execute
   them, it is necessary for clients to be able to determine the
   capabilities of the server to which it is connected. This
   specification defines a set of Extensible Markup Language (XML)
   elements for expressing presence policy capabilities.

Internet-Draft        Presence Policy Capabilities         February 2004


1. Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.

2. Introduction

   An important component of presence [5] is policy. Policy systems
   allow the presentity to grant access to specific pieces of
   information to specific watchers. These policy systems can be
   extremely simple or extremely complex. For this reason [1] defines a
   generic Extensible Markup Language (XML) based format for
   representing policy capabilities. That format applies to many
   services, including location and presence. This specification extends
   that one by defining policy capabilities specific to presence. Those
   policy capabilities correspond to the conditions, actions and
   transformations defined in [2].

3. Structure of Presence Policy Capabilities

   [1] defines the structure of common policy capability documents. In
   that specification, each policy capability document has three
   components - a list of supported conditions, a list of supported
   actions, and a list of supported transformations. This specification
   merely extends that document with the conditions, actions and
   transformations defined in [2]. It does so by defining six empty
   elements - "anonymous", "accept-subscription", "provide-presence",
   "show-namespace", "show-tuple", "show-element" - each of which
   indicates whether the respective attribute in [2] is supported. All
   of these elements are defined within the namespace:
      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:supported-pres-permissions

4. XML Schema


   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <xs:schema
   targetNamespace="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:supported-pres-permissions"
   xmlns:pc="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:supported-pres-permissions"
   xmlns:cc="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:supported-permissions"
   xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
   elementFormDefault="qualified" attributeFormDefault="unqualified">
   <xs:import namespace="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:supported-permissions"/>
   <xs:element name="anonymous" substitutionGroup="cc:condition"/>
   <xs:element name="accept-subscription" substitutionGroup="cc:action"/>
   <xs:element name="provide-presence" substitutionGroup="cc:action"/>

   <xs:element name="show-element" substitutionGroup="cc:transformation"/>
   <xs:element name="show-tuple" substitutionGroup="cc:transformation"/>
   </xs:schema>


5. Example Document

   The following document indicates that the identity, validity, sphere
   and confirmation attributes are supported. It also indicates that a
   vendor-specific condition, called "temp", is supported, in addition
   to two vendor-specific transformations - "max-security" and
   "min-security". The "show-tuple" element is also supported.


   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <supported-permissions
   xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:supported-permissions"
   xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   xmlns:vpp="http://www.vendor.com/extension1"
   xmlns:pc="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:supported-pres-permissions">
     <conditions>
       <identity/>
       <validity/>
       <sphere/>
       <vpp:temp/>

     </actions>
     <transformations>
       <vpp:min-security/>
       <vpp:max-security/>
       <pc:show-tuple/>

6. Security Considerations

   This specification does not introduce any new security considerations
   beyond those discussed in [1].

7. IANA Considerations

   specification.

7.1 URN Sub-Namespace Registrations

   This section registers a new XML namespace, as per the guidelines in
   [4]

                  <title>Supported Presence Permissions Namespace</title>
                </head>
                <body>
                  <h1>Namespace for Supported Permissions</h1>
