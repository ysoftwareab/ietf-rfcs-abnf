Abstract

   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) is applicable to
   Ethernet switches supporting Provider Backbone Bridge Traffic 
   Engineering (PBB-TE) networks. The GMPLS controlled PBB-TE network 
   not only automates creation and deletion of Eth-LSPs, but also provides
   sophisticated Eth-LSP recovery mechanisms such as protection and
   restoration of an Eth-LSP. This document describes the requirements for
   the set of solutions of GMPLS controlled PBB-TE networks.

1.  Introduction

   Scalability and manageability of Ethernet switched networks has
   continuously enhanced and the deployment of these switches supporting
   Provider Bridge (PB) [IEEE802.1ad] has became one of the solutions to 
   provide enterprise WAN/LAN services. IEEE standardization activities of 
   Provider Backbone Bridge (PBB) [IEEE 802.1ah] and PBB for Traffic
   Engineering (PBB-TE) [IEEE802.1Qay] provides an opportunity not only 
   for enhancing the scalability, manageability, and controllability of the 
   Ethernet service networks, but also for deploying access/metro 
   transport infrastructure.

   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) is the framework
   which handles various types of switches, namely packet switching, 
   Layer 2 switching, TDM switching, wavelength switching, and fiber 
   Switching [RFC3945]. Therefore, combinational usage of the GMPLS 
   and  PBB-TE is a fairly suitable ?guse case?h and contributes to 
   enhance flexibility of Ethernet Label Switched Path (Eth-LSP) over 
   PBB networks without defining additional connection layers.

   This document describes requirements for GMPLS protocols to control 
   PBB-TE networks which comprises mainly two parts. The first one
   is the requirements for GMPLS extension for controlling Ethernet 
   layer. The second one includes the requirements for GMPLS extension
   to support multi-layer operation. Although a large portion of 
   requirements in the second scope coincides with the description in
   [Interwk-req] and [MLN], some of important requirements are 
   also described in this document.

   In this version of the document, requirements for GELS [CCAMP-ETHERNET] 
   are under study and this may be provided in future version of this
   document.

3.  Reference model

3.1 Single Layer

   This document describes requirements based on the reference models
   depicted in Fig. 1. The first reference model is an intra-domain 
   and single layer GMPLS controlled PBB-TE network in which Eth-LSPs
   traverse over I-NNI between Back Bone Core Bridges (BCBs) or Back 
   Bone Edge Bridges with I-comonents and B-components (IB-BEB). 
   BCB/BEBs may interconnected by multiple links forming Link 
   Aggregation Group (LAG) [IEEE802.3].

3.2 Multi-layer

   The third reference model is PBB-TE and L1 (such as TDM, OTN, etc) 
   multi-layer network. Each PBB-TE node behaves as a border node between the
   PBB-TE layer and optical Layers. Each BCB or BEB terminates Ethernet 
   Port Label Switched Path (Eth-P-LSPs) and some Eth-P-LSPs dynamically 
   form LAG. Thus, some Eth-LSPs traverse over multiple Eth-P-LSPs, 
   while other Eth-LSPs traverse over single Eth-P-LSPs.

   Also, it is technically possible to form multiple layer PBB-TE 
   networks. Namely, the reference model is defined as the case 
   that PBB-TE network substitutes L1 network in Fig.2, and realizes 
   BMAC in BMAC Ethernet transport.

   The routing information of optical layer may be isolated 
   (overlay model), shuffled (peer model), or virtualized with FA-
   LSPs(augmented model) for PBB-TE layer.

4.  Requirements for Ethernet layer control

   This section describes requirements for single layer PBB-TE network
   based on the reference model from Fig.1.


4.1 Neighbor discovery mechanism 

   The solution MUST be able to realize automatic neighbor discovery
   as realized in current PB or PBB networks.
   Namely, the solution MUST support a automatic negotiation mechanism
   to exchange information of Node ID, TE-Link ID, Data-link ID 
   (in the case of link Bundling), and IP address of the control channel.
   The solution MUST include specification of inter-operable test 
   mechanisms specified for TDM networks in [RFC4207].
   On the other hand, the extension should be minimized by making use 
   of [IEEE 802.1AB].


4.2 In-band control plane channel 

   The solution should be able to establish in-band control channel.
   Solution should include negotiation mechanism to specify bandwidth
   of control-channel between peers.
   Considering the robustness and manageability of control-channel, 
   the in-band control channel itself should be Eth-LSP with high-
   priority.

draft-imajuku-ccamp-ethernet-gmpls-req-00.txt             November  2007


4.3 Prevention of Loops

   The solution MUST have reliability to prevent creating loops of 
   Eth-LSPs. Specifically if the solution supports numbered TE-Link 
   addressing, it is essential to specify some new extension or new 
   methodology to detect or prevent a loop.


4.4 Egress Port Control

   The solution MUST have solution not only to assign Egress Port,
   but also discriminate port types whether the port should be
   I-component or B-component. 


4.5 Link Aggregation Group (LAG) related functionality

   The solution should include functionality to coordinate with Link 
   Aggregation Group (LAG). Solution should include operational
   scenarios described in following sections.

4.5.1 Failure or deletion of LAG member link

   The solution should include functionality to prioritize Eth-LSPs,
   when one or more LAG member links fails and total bandwidth of 
   Eth-LSPs exceeds total bandwidth of healthy LAG members.

   The solution should also include notification of the functionality of 
   Eth-LSPs whose traffic was discarded by high-priority Eth-LSPs.
   The solution should be able to provide an option for operators to
   take some actions such as switchover to back-up Eth-LSPs as 
   specified in [G-8031].

4.5.2 Failure of LAG member link of Destination MAC

   Specifically, the solution should include functionality to reallocate
   Labels of Eth-LSPs, when failed LAG member link is the source or 
   destination of the Eth-LSPs.

4.5.3 Recovery or addition of LAG member link

   The solution should include functionality to prioritize Eth-LSPs,
   when one or more LAG member links fails and the total bandwidth of 
   Eth-LSPs exceeds the total bandwidth of healthy LAG members.

   The solution should include notification functionality to indicate
   recovery of bandwidth following to the recovery of LAG member link.
   The solution should be able to provide option for operators to
   take some actions such as reversion to primary Eth-LSPs which 
   are transmitted over .

draft-imajuku-ccamp-ethernet-gmpls-req-00.txt             November  2007


4.6 Inter-domain Ethernet LSP

   The solution should include functionality to control inter-domain 
   Eth-LSPs. Here, the solution should support Eth-LSP traverses over
   demarcation points faced with B-component interfaces.


5.  Requirements for multilayer network

   This section describes requirements for a single layer PBB-TE network
   based on the reference model of Fig.2.

5.1 Dynamic formation of LAG

    The solution should include dynamic formation of LAG following to 
    creation or deletion of Eth-P-LSPs. The solution should be similar
    to that of dynamic formation of virtually concatenated group (VCG) 
    in SDH/SONET or OTN networks [VCAT&LCAS].

    On the other hand, the solution should provide reliability not to 
    misconfigure LAG as links forming a loop.

5.2 Other requirements

    The architecture and requirements for MPLS-GMPLS inter-working are 
    described in [Interwk-fwk] and [Interwk-req]. Some of the requirements
    described in [Interwk-req] are valid even for the case of GMPLS-GMPLS
    interworking between PBB-TE and L1 network layers. Namely,
    1) End-to-End signaling of Eth-LSPs
    2) Triggered establishment of L1 LSPs
    3) Advertisement of PBB-TE information via L1 GMPLS networks
    4) Selective Advertisement of PBB-TE information via a Border node
    5) Avoiding complexity and risks.

    For more details, see [Interwk-req] and MPLS-TE client network 
    written in the document should be understood as PBB-TE client network.
