Abstract

   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (the IANA) is responsible for
   assignment of parameter values within identifier spaces used in the
   Internet, including the Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) address
   space. The IANA allocates parts of the IPv4 space to Regional
   Internet Registries, which are delegated the responsibility for the
   assignment of IPv4 addresses to operators and users of the Internet
   within their regions. In addition to these assignments, the IANA is

   responsible for allocating IPv4 space for global and other
   specialized address blocks.

   This document describes the global and other specialized IPv4 address
   blocks that have been assigned by the IANA. It does not address IPv4
   address space assigned to operators and users through the Regional
   Internet Registries.  It also does not address allocations or 
   assignments of IPv6 addresses or autonomous system numbers.


1. Introduction

   Throughout its entire history, the Internet has employed a central
   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority responsible for the allocation
   and assignment of various identifiers needed for the operation of the
   Internet [RFC1174]. In the case of the IPv4 address space, the IANA
   allocates parts of the address space to Regional Internet Registries
   (currently there are three) according to their established needs.
   These Regional Internet Registries are responsible for the assignment
   of IPv4 addresses to operators and users of the Internet within their
   regions.

   Minor portions of the IPv4 address space have been allocated or
   assigned directly by the IANA for global or other specialized
   purposes. These allocations and assignments have been documented in a
   variety of RFCs and other documents. This document is intended to
   collect these scattered references.

   On an ongoing basis, the IANA has been designated by the IETF to make
   assignments in support of the Internet Standards Process [RFC2860].
   Section 3 of this document describes that assignment process.


2. Global and Other Specialized Address Blocks

   0.0.0.0/8 - Addresses in this block refer to source hosts on "this"
   network. Address 0.0.0.0/32 may be used as a source address for this
   host on this network; other addresses within 0.0.0.0/8 may be used to
   refer to specified hosts on this network.

   10.0.0.0/8 - This block is set aside for use in private networks. Its
   intended use is documented in [RFC1918].  Addresses within this block
   are not routable on the public Internet.

   14.0.0.0/8 - This block is set aside for assignments to the
   international system of Public Data Networks. The registry of
   assignments within this block can be accessed from the "Public Data

   Network Numbers" link on the web page at 
   http://www.iana.org/numbers.html.

   24.0.0.0/8 - This block was allocated in early 1996 for use in
   provisioning IP service over cable television systems.  Although the
   IANA initially was involved in making assignments to cable operators,
   this responsibility was transferred to American Registry for Internet
   Numbers (ARIN) in May 2001.

   39.0.0.0/8 - This block was used in the "Class A Subnet Experiment"
   that commenced in May 1995, as documented in [RFC1797]. The
   experiment has been completed and this block has been returned to the
   pool of addresses reserved for future allocation or assignment.

   127.0.0.0/8 - This block is assigned for use as the Internet host
   loopback address. A datagram sent by a higher level protocol to an
   address anywhere within this block should loop back inside the host.
   This is ordinarily implemented using only 127.0.0.1/32 for loopback,
   but no addresses in this block should ever appear on any network
   anywhere.

   169.254.0.0/16 - This is the "linklocal" block. It is allocated for
   use in end node auto-configuration when a DHCP server may not be
   found.

   172.16.0.0/12 - This block is set aside for use in private networks.
   Its intended use is documented in [RFC1918].  Addresses within this
   block are not routable on the public Internet.

   192.0.2.0/24 - This block is assigned as "TEST-NET" for use in
   documentation and example code. It is often used in conjunction with
   domain names example.com or example.net in vendor and protocol
   documentation.

   192.88.99.0/24 - This block is allocated for use as 6to4 relay
   anycast addresses, according to [RFC3068].

   192.168.0.0/16 - This block is set aside for use in private networks.
   Its intended use is documented in [RFC1918].  Addresses within this
   block are not routable on the public Internet.

   198.18.0.0/15 - This block has been allocated for use in benchmark
   tests of network interconnect devices. Its use is documented in
   [RFC2544].

   224.0.0.0/4 - This block, formerly known as the Class D address
   space, is allocated for use in IPv4 multicast address assignments.
   The IANA guidelines for assignments from this space are described in



IANA                      Expires August 21, 2002                [Page 3]

DRAFT                  Special-Use IPv4 Addresses          February 2002


   [RFC3171].

   240.0.0.0/4 - This block, formerly known as the Class E address
   space, is reserved for future use. The "limited broadcast"
   destination address 255.255.255.255 must never be forwarded outside
   the (sub-)net of the source.


3. Assignments of IPv4 Blocks for New Specialized Uses

   The IANA has responsibilty for making assignments of protocol
   parameters used in the Internet according to the requirements of the
   "Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Technical Work of the
   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority". [RFC2860] Among other things,
   [RFC2860] requires that protocol parameters be assigned according to
   the criteria and procedures specified in RFCs, including Proposed,
   Draft and full Internet Standards and Best Current Practice
   documents, and any other RFC that calls for IANA assignment.

   Although the domain name and IP address spaces involve policy issues
   (in addition to technical issues) so that the requirements of
   [RFC2860] do not apply generally to those spaces, the IANA is
   responsible for ensuring assignments of IPv4 addresses as needed in
   support of the Internet Standards Process. When a portion of the IPv4
   address space is specifically required by an RFC, the technical
   requirements (e.g., size, prefix length) for the portion should be
   described. [RFC2434] Immediately before the RFC is published, the
   IANA will, in consultation with the Regional Internet Registries,
   make the necessary assignment and notify the RFC Editor of the
   particulars for inclusion in the RFC as published.

   As required by [RFC2860], IANA will also make necessary experimental
   assignments of IPv4 addresses, also in consultation with the Regional
   Internet Registries.


4. Security Considerations

   The particular assigned values of special-use IPv4 addresses 
   cataloged in this document do not directly raise security issues.  
   However, awareness of these special assignments offers the ability 
   to detect inappropriate IPv4 addresses within packets on the public 
   Internet.  

5. IANA Considerations

   This document describes the IANA's past and current practices and
   does not create any new requirements for assignments or allocations
   by the IANA.
