1.  Introduction and Scope

   The CDNI working group is developing a set of protocols to enable the
   interconnection of multiple CDNs to a CDN federation, as discussed in
   [RFC6770].  The CDNI protocol suite consists of multiple HTTP-based
   interfaces, many of which transfer various json encoded payloads.
   The main interfaces (i.e., CDNI Control interface, CDNI Footprint &
   Capabilities Advertisement interface, CDNI Request Routing
   Redirection interface, CDNI Metadata interface, and CDNI Logging
   interface) are described in [RFC7336].  It is desirable to be able to
   indicate the type of object carried in the HTTP entity-body without
   having to register separate media types for each CDNI object.  To
   accomplish this aims, this document defines a single new media type
   for CDNI that includes a required payload-type parameter.  A separate
   registry of CDNI payload-type parameter values is also defined.  CDNI
   protocol specifications may register interface-specific payload-
   types, specifying the payload encoding and parsing semantics for that
   message (e.g., json serialization for a CDNI metadata object).  The
   same payload-type parameter names may also be used as references for
   other purposes (e.g., referencing CDNI metadata objects from CDNI
   capability advertisement objects).

2.  IANA Considerations

   This section contains the CDNI media type registration request for
   IANA, as well as the payload-type parameter registry definition for
   IANA.

Internet-Draft               CDNI Media Type                 August 2015


2.1.  CDNI Media Type

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: cdni

   Required parameters:

      ptype

         The required parameter "ptype" describes the type of CDNI
         message contained in the message payload, as registered in the
         CDNI Payload Type Parameter Registry (Section 2.2) defined
         below.

   Optional parameters: none

   Encoding considerations:

      The CDNI protocol suite includes interfaces with json encoded
      messages which may be 8bit or binary, as well as generic logging
      information which may be 7bit or binary.

   Security considerations:

      CDNI interfaces that return json encoded data may be
      (mis)interpreted if parsed by non-CDNI or non-compliant CDNI
      implementations.  In addition, CDNI logging information is likely
      to transfer large amounts of data which may overload unexpecting
      clients.  The individual CDNI interface specifications provide
      more detailed analysis of security and privacy concerns, and
      define the requirements for authentication, authorization,
      confidentiality, integrity, and privacy for each interface.

   Interoperability considerations:

      The required ptype field is intended to fully describe the
      structure and parsing of CDNI messages, as enforced by the ptype
      registry expert reviewer.

   Published specification: RFCthis

   Applications that use this media type:

      CDNI is intended for use between interconnected CDNs for sharing
      configuration and logging data, as well as for issuing content
      management and redirection requests.

   Additional information: N/A

      Deprecated alias names for this type: N/A

   Intended usage: LIMITED USE

   Restrictions on usage:

      This media type is intended only for use in CDNI protocol message
      exchanges.

   Provisional registration: yes

2.2.  CDNI Payload Type Parameter Registry

   The IANA is requested to create a new "CDNI Payload Type" registry.
   The "CDNI Payload Type" namespace defines the valid values for the
   required "ptype" parameter of the "application/cdni" media type.  The
   CDNI Payload Type is an ASCII string value, consisting of only
   visible (printing) characters, but excluding equal signs (=), double
   quotes ("), and semicolons (;), and not exceeding 256 characters in
   length.

   Additions to the CDNI Payload Type namespace conform to the "Expert
   Review" policy as defined in [RFC5226].  The expert review will
   verify that new type definitions do not duplicate existing type
   definitions (in name or functionality), prevent gratuitous additions
   to the namespace, and prevent any additions to the namespace which
   would impair the interoperability of CDNI implementations.  The
   expert review will include review of a publicly available written
   specification (preferably an RFC, though an RFC is not required).

   The expert review will verify the following information is documented
   in the written specification:

   o  The review will verify that the specification contains a
      reasonably defined purpose for the new payload type, where rhe
      purpose is related to an existing or proposed CDNI interface and
      does not duplicate the functionality of any existing CDNI protocol
      feature without specifying a rational reason (e.g., updating an
      obsolete feature), a method for detecting and handling conflicts
      (e.g., a versioning system with prioritization matrix), and a
      suggested migration path (e.g., deprecation of the overlapped
      feature, or justification for co-existence).

   o  The review will verify that the specification contains information
      as to which CDNI interface the new payload type pertains/affects.
      The payload type may be applicable to multiple CDNI interfaces,
      but the justification for the new payload type will include a
      reasonable relationship to at least one standards track CDNI
      interface.

   o  The review will verify that the specification contains sufficient
      detail about the data encoding (e.g., json serialization for new
      CDNI metadata or capability advertisement objects, or ABNF and
      description for new CDNI logging file formats) to allow senders
      and receivers of the new payload type to implement compliant and
      interoperable payload parsers.

   The registry contains the Payload Type value, and the specification
   describing the Payload Type.  The registry will initially be
   unpopulated.
