Abstract 
    
   This document defines how GMPLS can be used to dynamically modify 
   the bandwidth of a TDM circuit. It focuses first on SONET/SDH and 
   will cover G.709 in a next version. 
    
   SONET/SDH Bandwidth modification can be indeed achieved in very 
   different ways. It can be done by establishing another circuit 
   between the same source and destination with different 
   characteristics (e.g. signal type) and then by switching the 
   traffic to that new circuit doing a switchover. 
    
   At the other end of the spectrum, bandwidth modification can be 
   done by dynamically adding or removing SPEs/VCs to a circuit using 
   the concept of virtual or contiguous concatenation. This is 
   ideally achieved in a non-disruptive way and by avoiding double 
   counting (i.e. double reserving) the resources while modifying the 
   bandwidth, by using the concept of make-before-break. This 
   specification focuses on this last case. 
    
   Bandwidth modification is in practice easier to do when virtual 
   concatenation is used since SPEs/VCs don't need to be contiguous, 
   are transported individually and can even be routed independently.

   This can be achieved as well when contiguous concatenation is used 
   but is in practice less likely to happen since a bandwidth 
   increase requires additional free SPEs/VCs physically contiguous 
   at the end of the circuit. 
    
   This specification also defines how to use multiple differently 
   routed LSPs to build a single SONET/SDH virtually concatenated 
   circuit. Each LSP can be protected/restored individually. 
 
    
1. Introduction 
    
    
   Extensions to GMPLS are defined to control SONET/SDH networks in 
   [GMPLS-SONET-SDH] and [GMPLS-SONET-SDH-EXT]. These extensions 
   define SONET/SDH traffic parameters used to describe in details 
   the type of SONET/SDH LSP (i.e. circuit) being requested. Such a 
   circuit can be requested unidirectional or bi-directional. 
    
   In some cases it is useful to dynamically change the bandwidth 
   allocated for a SONET/SDH circuit. For instance, it is very useful 
   when Ethernet traffic is transported over SONET/SDH. According to 
   the demand, the size of a concatenated circuit can be modified 
   dynamically without having to reestablish a new circuit, and 
   potentially to interrupt the service. 
    
   Bandwidth modification can be indeed achieved in very different 
   ways. It can be done by establishing another circuit between the 
   same source and destination with different characteristics (e.g. 
   signal type) and then by switching the traffic to that new circuit 
   doing a switchover. 
    
   At the other end of the spectrum, bandwidth modification can be 
   done by dynamically adding or removing SPEs/VCs to a circuit using 
   the concept of virtual or contiguous concatenation. This is 
   ideally achieved in a non-disruptive way and by avoiding double 
   counting (i.e. double reserving) the resources while modifying the 
   bandwidth. This specification focuses on this non-disruptive case. 
    
   In practice, bandwidth modification is easy to achieve thanks to 
   the concept of virtual concatenation, by adding or removing 
   SPEs/VCs, which can be located anywhere, to a virtually 
   concatenated circuit. 
    
   This can be performed similarly with contiguous concatenation but 
   in practice this method is less likely to happen, e.g. a bandwidth 
   increase can require additional free SPEs/VCs physically 
   contiguous before or after the circuit. 
 
   Moreover, as currently defined, GMPLS only allows the SPEs/VCs of 
   a virtually concatenated circuit to be co-routed through the same 
   line/multiplex section. This specification removes this limitation

   by allowing the same SONET/SDH circuit to be made of several 
   independent LSPs. 
    
   In that case, LSPs can be set-up, maintained and deleted 
   independently, while being part of the same SONET/SDH circuit. 
   LSPs can be co-routed through the same component TE link, through 
   different components of the same TE link or even routed completely 
   diversely, as far as T1X1/ITU-T requirements for differential 
   delays are respected (out of the scope of this specification). 
    
   T1X1 and ITU-T are standardizing a similar concept for SONET/SDH 
   and G.709, independently of any distributed control plane and for 
   virtual concatenation only. They have defined a new signaling 
   protocol transported in-band in the overhead. For SONET/SDH, this 
   protocol is transported in the Path Overhead (POH). 
    
   This protocol is defined in ITU-T Recommendation G.7042 (ex 
   G.lcas) and is called Link Capacity Adjustment Scheme (LCAS) for 
   virtual concatenated signals. 
    
   LCAS allows increasing or decreasing the capacity of a virtual 
   container that is transported using Virtual Concatenation. In 
   addition, LCAS will automatically decrease the capacity if a 
   member experiences a failure in the network, and increase the 
   capacity when the network fault is repaired. 
    
   For SDH, LCAS is defined for all VC types for which virtual 
   concatenation is defined, i.e. VC-4, VC-3, VC-2, VC-12 and VC-11. 
   Using LCAS, a VC can only be added at the end of a concatenated 
   signal, but can be removed from any place. 
    
   This document defines LSP Bandwidth Modification (LBM) procedures 
   and extensions for GMPLS using either virtual concatenation or 
   contiguous concatenation. It first focuses on SONET/SDH and will 
   later cover G.709 with the same approach in a next version. 
    
   Similarly to GMPLS, this specification covers unidirectional LSPs 
   and bi-directional symmetric LSPs. Bi-directional asymmetric LSPs 
   are not supported today by GMPLS. It should be noted however that 
   today operators do not use such asymmetric LSPs in practice. 
    
   This specification allows bandwidth modification being requested 
   only by the initiator (source) of a circuit. A next version could 
   cover destination initiated bandwidth modification. However, we 
   expect to cover most of the operational needs using initiator 
   control. 
    
   This specification could be extended in the future to cover 
   modification of other circuit attributes than the bandwidth, like 
   link protection/restoration characteristics. It focuses first on 
   the SONET/SDH bandwidth modification initiated by the source since 
   it meets the current operational needs.

2. SONET/SDH Virtual and Contiguous Concatenation 
    
   This section of the draft introduces SDH virtual and contiguous 
   concatenation, this will be extended with a description of the 
   SONET concatenation in a future version. 
    
   Section 11 of G.707 (April 2000) recommendation defines VC 
   contiguous and virtual concatenation. Contiguous concatenation 
   maintains the contiguous bandwidth through the whole network, 
   while virtual concatenation breaks the contiguous bandwidth into 
   individuals VCs, transports and routes these VCs individually from 
   the source and then recombines them at the path termination. 
    
   Virtual concatenation requires concatenation functionality only at 
   the path termination equipment, while contiguous concatenation 
   requires concatenation functionality at each network element. 
    
   Contiguous concatenation is defined for VC-4s to provide a VC-4-Xc 
   (X=4, 16, 64, 256) and for VC-2s in a higher order VC-3 to provide 
   a VC-2-Xc (X=1...7). Other types of non-standard contiguous 
   concatenation are detailed in [GMPLS-SONET-SDH-EXT]. 
    
   Virtual concatenation is defined for VC-4s, VC-3s, VC-2s, VC-12s 
   and VC-11s but only for the same types of VCs. The virtual 
   concatenation of X VC-4/3 (X=1...256) provides a VC-4/3-Xv. The 
   number of low order VCs that can be virtually concatenated 
   together depends on the higher order VC in which they are 
   transported and is defined according to table 11-9 in G.707. Other 
   types of non-standard virtual concatenation are detailed in 
   [GMPLS-SONET-SDH-EXT]. 
    
   Each VC has its own Path Overhead (POH). The VC-2/1 K4 POH byte in 
   bit 2 is multi-framed in 32 frames to form a 32 bits string and is 
   used to indicate a frame count and a sequence indicator. The frame 
   count provides a measure of the differential delay (see ITU-T 
   G.707). Each VC2/1 of a VC-2/1-Xv has a fixed unique sequence 
   number in the range of 0 to X-1. 
    
   The VC-4/3 H4 POH byte is used for the virtual concatenation 
   specific sequence and multi-frame indication. It is more 
   elaborated than for low order VCs and uses a two-stage multi-
   framing. What is important in the context of GMPLS LBM is that 
   each VC-4/3 has a fixed sequence number in the range of 0 to X-1. 
    
   These VC sequence numbers will be used by the GMPLS LBM procedures 
   to identify each frame unambiguously in the same virtually 
   concatenated circuit. 
    
   VCs can be routed and transported individually, even over 
   different multiplex sections, i.e. over different TE link 
   components or over different TE links. They are obvious 
   limitations due to the differential delay between different routes 
   (not in the scope of this specification). GMPLS LBM will provide 
   the same level of flexibility, using and combining multiple LSPs.

3. GMPLS LBM versus LCAS 
    
   LCAS causes internetworking issues with GMPLS. Having two 
   signaling protocols running in parallel to control the same LSP is 
   not an ideal case. Using LCAS in parallel with GMPLS implies that 
   GMPLS traffic parameters may be modified without the GMPLS control 
   plane being aware of these modifications. However, GMPLS provides 
   natively capabilities to modify traffic parameters of an 
   established LSP. Indeed, the MPLS signaling was originally 
   conceived to allow traffic parameter (bandwidth) modification. 
    
   LCAS is a signaling protocol restricted to the bandwidth 
   modification at end systems. It doesn't allow setting up and 
   releasing circuits dynamically, and doesn't allow setting up and 
   releasing bandwidth in intermediate nodes. The advantage of using 
   GMPLS is that it provides a complete integrated solution, allowing 
   for a wide range of traffic parameter modifications. 
    
   Using multiple LSPs to support a single circuit (optional) has the 
   drawback of requiring more signaling but this seems to be the most 
   appropriate way to operate within the context of a global control 
   plane. It provides the advantage that each independent LSP can be 
   protected/restored independently. Note that GMPLS LBM can be first 
   used to modify the bandwidth of a single unique LSP (circuit), 
   without any LSP combination. 
    
   One drawback of LCAS is that it requires changing the transport 
   plane since new overhead bytes are used. In consequence, new ASICs 
   must be used at both termination ends. On the contrary, GMPLS LBM 
   is done purely in the control plane. It does not require any new 
   ASICs and is backward compatible with the existing hardware. 
    
   This specification defines how to perform bandwidth modification 
   using the GMPLS signaling. The final result will be almost similar 
   than the one achieved using LCAS, with the advantage of being an 
   integrated solution that doesn't require adaptation of the 
   transport plane. 
    
4. GMPLS LBM Procedures Using a Parallel Circuit 
    
   This section describes how to modify the bandwidth of a circuit by 
   establishing a new completely bandwidth disjoint circuit and 
   moving the traffic to that new circuit by doing a switchover. This 
   procedure can be done manually or automatically. It uses a 
   simplified version of the make-before-break concept. 
    
   Note that the concept of "make-before-break" should be better 
   renamed "share-before-break" in this document. In addition, 
   "break" refers more to the LSP status modification in the control 
   plane.

draft-mannie-ccamp-gmpls-lbm-tdm-00.txt                   November, 01 

   A new disjoint circuit is established first. It can be routed 
   differently from the original circuit and may have completely 
   different traffic parameters. This new circuit reserves its own 
   resources and while the switchover is not done, some bandwidth may 
   be double reserved. 
    
   This is for instance the only way to change the bandwidth of an 
   SDH LSP from a non-concatenated VC type to a different non-
   concatenated VC type. For instance, going from a VC-12 to a VC-3 
   for an IP bandwidth upgrade. Clearly, a VC-12 cannot be shared at 
   the same time with a VC-3 while transporting data. 
    
   With RSVP-TE, the procedures described in [RSVP-TE] section 4.6.4 
   could be used but with a FF (Fixed Filter) reservation style 
   instead of a SE (Share Explicit) style (this requires further 
   investigation). An alternative is to use a disjoint source route 
   with a SE style. 
    
   With CR-LDP, the procedures described in [CRLDP-MODIFY] MUST be 
   used. A new Action Indicator Flag [CRLDP] value is defined 
   hereafter. A disjoint source route can also be used. 
 
          TBD: indicates modify LSP via a bandwidth disjoint LSP 
    
   The important point is that the LSP destination must be able to 
   understand that a new LSP is intended to replace an existing one 
   and that this is not just a new independent LSP being setup. This 
   is achieved using the procedures referenced just before. 
    
   For SONET/SDH, the switchover from the working circuit to the new 
   one is a pure local operation. It can be done very quickly, and 
   certainly faster than 50ms. From that perspective it can be 
   considered as non-service impacting and non-disruptive. 
    
    
5. GMPLS LBM Procedures Using Virtual Concatenation 

   This section defines simple procedures for SONET/SDH circuit 
   bandwidth modification when virtual concatenation is used. It first 
   defines the procedures to add or remove VCs in a single LSP, and 
   then defines the procedures to combine several LSPs together. 
    
   A non-concatenated circuit can also be modified to a virtually 
   concatenated circuit (with any number of SPEs/VCs), and vice-versa, 
   by using the procedures defined hereafter. 
    
5.1 Single LSP bandwidth modification 
    
   This section is only applicable to the standard virtual 
   concatenation as defined by T1X1/ITU-T. Another section deals with 
   non-standard other types of virtual concatenation. 
    
   SONET/SDH LSP bandwidth modification can only be allowed when the 
   LSP is already set up and active, i.e. modification is not defined 
 
     E. Mannie et. al. Internet-Draft May 2001                      6 

draft-mannie-ccamp-gmpls-lbm-tdm-00.txt                   November, 01 

   or allowed during the LSP(s) establishment or release. Only 
   bandwidth modification requested by the ingress LSR of the LSP is 
   considered here. The Ingress LSR cannot modify an LSP before a 
   previous modification procedure is completed. 
    
   When a bandwidth modification is requested, a new (updated) 
   SONET/SDH traffic parameter is send downstream within a Path/Label 
   Request message. This request is explicitly identified as a 
   bandwidth modification request using a special indication 
   mechanism. 
    
   With RSVP-TE, the procedures for bandwidth modification defined in 
   section 4.6.4 of [RSVP-TE] are used. The SENDER_TEMPLATE and 
   FILTER_SPEC objects carry a modified LSP ID when a Path message with 
   a modified SONET/SDH traffic parameter has to be sent. This allows 
   recognizing that a bandwidth modification is requested. 
    
   With CR-LDP, the procedures described in [CRLDP-MODIFY] MUST be 
   used. The Action Indicator Flag [CRLDP] of the LSPID TLV indicates 
   an LSP modification. This allows recognizing that a bandwidth 
   modification is requested. 
    
   If accepted, the same new traffic parameter is sent back to the 
   source also indicating a bandwidth modification indication. This 
   traffic parameter is transported in the FLOWSPEC of a Resv message 
   with RSVP-TE or in the Label Mapping message with CR-LDP. 
    
   If refused, the previously used SONET/SDH traffic parameter is sent 
   back to the source also indicating a bandwidth modification 
   indication. It allows ensuring that the request for bandwidth 
   modification was well received and treated by the destination. 
    
   The actual bandwidth allocation is committed when the Resv message 
   flows in the upstream direction. 
    
   A modified SONET/SDH traffic parameter SHOULD have a different NVC 
   field and MAY have a different MT field. The multiplier field (MT) 
   SHOULD not be used since it is used for a different semantic. All 
   other fields MUST be identical. 
    
   SPEs/VCs can only be added at the end of an LSP (similarly to 
   LCAS). For instance, when adding Y VC-4s to a VC-4-Xv (where each 
   of the VC-4 is numbered from 0 to X-1), one obtains a VC-4-(X+Y)v 
   with the sequence numbered from 0 to X+Y-1. 
    
   The number Y of SPEs/VCs to add is given by the following 
   equation: (new NVC * new MT) - (old NVC * old MT). The first new 
   SPE/VC will have a sequence number equals to the sequence number 
   of the previously last VC + 1 (i.e. X). 
    
   SPEs/VCs can be removed from an LSP but only at the end of that LSP 
   (i.e. starting at SPE/VC sequence number X). When a new traffic 
   parameter is sent requesting less SPEs/VCs, the difference is 
   removed from the end. This is a light limitation in comparison with 
 
     E. Mannie et. al. Internet-Draft May 2001                      7 

draft-mannie-ccamp-gmpls-lbm-tdm-00.txt                   November, 01 

   LCAS that allows removing SPEs/VCs from anywhere, however this 
   doesn't provide any real interest. 
    
   The sequence number of each SPE/VC is transported in the 
   corresponding POH according to the SONET/SDH specifications. It is 
   not needed to transport these sequence numbers in the GMPLS 
   signaling, they are implicitly deduced at each end according to the 
   order of operations. When adding or removing SPEs/VCs, the sequence 
   numbers of the other (previous) SPEs/VCs of the same LSP are not 
   modified and stay identical. 
 
    
5.2 Multiple LSPs combination 
    
   The reasons to combine multiple LSPs to provide one big SONET/SDH 
   circuit were already explained before. Such a combination requires 
   that all LSPs belonging to the same circuit be clearly identified as 
   belonging to the same group, and be clearly identified as being in a 
   given order. This is achieved by using a Circuit ID and an LSP 
   Sequence Number in the signaling. Obviously, each LSP of the 
   combination may have a different number of SPEs/VCs. 
    
   All LSPs belonging to the same circuit MUST have the same Circuit 
   ID. All LSPs MUST have a unique LSP sequence number in that Circuit 
   ID, the LSP sequence number MUST be the sequence number of the first 
   SPE/VC of the overall virtually concatenated circuit. This sequence 
   number is redundant information with the SONET/SDH SPE/VC sequence 
   number transported in the POH. This allows a level of consistency 
   checking between the control plane and the transport plane. 
    
   From the GMPLS control plane point of view, these LSPs are seen as 
   totally independent and being uniquely identified in RSVP-TE by the 
   SESSION object together with the SENDER_TEMPLATE or FILTER_SPEC 
   object. They can be co-routed or not. They can be routed explicitly 
   diversely or not. They can fail separately and be individually 
   protected/restored or not. 
    
   The GMPLS LBM "application" can be seen as a straightforward 
   application at the top of the control plane, managing individual 
   LSPs made of virtually concatenating VCs, to build a bigger 
   SONET/SDH virtually concatenated circuit. This "application" is only 
   supported at each end of an SONET/SDH circuit without impacting 
   intermediate nodes. 
    
   All SPEs/VCs corresponding to a new LSP can only be added at the end 
   of the virtually concatenated signal. In that case, the SPE/VC 
   sequence number of the first SPE/VC is the sequence number of the 
   last SPE/VC of the last LSP + 1. 
    
   When an LSP is removed, for whatever reason, all its SPEs/VCs are 
   removed. In that case, it means that sequence numbers of other 
   SPEs/VCs belonging to the LSPs logically following the removed LSP 
   must be renumbered. The same is done for the LSP sequence numbers. 

 
     E. Mannie et. al. Internet-Draft May 2001                      8

   This is not an issue since all the LSPs are controlled by the same 
   entity. 
    
   Note that according to the single LSP bandwidth modification 
   procedure defined here before, only the last SPEs/VCs of an LSP can 
   be removed. It results in a multi-LSP configuration that SPEs/VCs 
   can also be removed independently of a complete LSP removal but with 
   the given restriction. 
    
   All LSPs belonging to the same virtually concatenated signal MUST 
   have the same SONET/SDH traffic parameter, except for the NVC and MT 
   fields. Note however that the use of the multiplier (MT) in that 
   context is not recommended. 
    
5.3 Virtual concatenation of contiguously concatenated signals 
    
   [GMPLS-SONET-SDH-EXT] allows for the virtual concatenation of 
   contiguously concatenated signals. The procedures for that 
   particular case are for further study and should be part of a non-
   standard extension to this draft. 
    
5.4 SPE/VC recognition and significance 
    
   When a modification occurs in a virtually concatenated signal, the 
   receiving end needs to know which SPE/VC is part of the circuit and 
   when the content of each SPE/VC is significant. 
    
   A SPE/VC is considered as being part of circuit when it is signaled, 
   i.e. when the corresponding Resv/Label Mapping message is sent back 
   to the source. The SPE/VC content is considered as significant when 
   it is received with a non-unequipped indication and a valid sequence 
   number according to the receiving end status. 
    
   Note that to ensure that in the upstream direction the destination 
   end doesn't send traffic before the source completed the bandwidth 
   modification; the destination end MAY simply wait for a ResvConf to 
   be received with RSVP. 
    
   Note that the sequence number transported in the POH has a global 
   significance per circuit not per LSP. 
    
   Since multi-frames are used, the sequence number is considered 
   usable only when the last bit of the multi-framed field has been 
   received. 
    
   For SDH, indication of an unequipped or equipped signal is given in 
   the C2 byte for VC-4/3 POH, and in the V5 byte for VC-2/VC-12 and 
   VC-11. Note that these bytes provide also the type of client signal

   This specification requires the encoding and transport of a Circuit 
   ID and an LSP sequence number for all LSP being established 
   according to the procedures of section 5. Having a Circuit ID even 
   for the single LSP further allows adding additional LSPs to that 
   circuit. 
    
   A new Circuit ID object/TLV is defined to identify all LSPs 
   belonging to the same SONET/SDH circuit. 
    
   For RSVP-TE, one new SENDER_TEMPLATE class object is defined and 
   uses a new C-Type (TBA), and one new FILTER_SPEC class object is 
   defined and uses a new C-Type (TBA). In both cases the same object 
   format is used and is defined hereafter.

   Circuit ID field: 
    
   This is a unique Circuit ID number, generated by the source. It is 
   unique in the context of the source and does not change during the 
   lifetime of the circuit. 
    
   LSP Sequence Number field: 
    
   This is a unique sequence number in the context of the Circuit ID. 
   It allows ordering the LSP in the SONET/SDH virtually concatenated 
   signal. Numbering starts at 0. 
    
   For CR-LDP, a new CircuitID TLV is defined and the use of LSPID TLV 
   is mandatory. The format of the CircuitID TLV is defined hereafter.

   The fields of that TLV have the same definition as in the RSVP-TE 
   case. 
    
6. GMPLS LBM Procedures with Contiguous Concatenation 
    
   This section is for further study but the principles could be 
   based on the following ideas:

   The concept of make-before-break defined in MPLS can also be used 
   to support bandwidth modification of continuously concatenated 
   signals in the same way as with the single LSP bandwidth 
   modification with virtual concatenation. However, in that case 
   multiple LSPs cannot be combined. 
    
   A non-concatenated circuit can also be modified to a contiguously 
   concatenated circuit (with any number of SPEs/VCs), and vice-
   versa, by using the procedures defined hereafter. 
    
   When increasing the bandwidth of a circuit, it works only if the 
   right number of free SPEs/VCs can be found directly before the 
   beginning of the circuit, or after the end of the circuit. This is 
   unlikely to happen in most of the cases. 
    
   When decreasing the bandwidth of a circuit, it works in all cases. 
    
   Note that in contrary to virtual concatenation, there is one 
   single POH. There is of course no SPE/VC sequence number. 
    
   By analyzing the frame overhead (pointers) one can discover how 
   many SPEs/VCs are contiguously concatenated in one SONET/SDH 
   frame. The new number of concatenated SPEs/VCs must match what was 
   advertised in the traffic parameters. 
    
   For instance, a received SDH STM-64 frame can contain a VC-4-4c, 
   while a next frame can contain a VC-4-16c starting at the same 
   place as the VC-4-4c and thus occupying the same first VC-4 
   spaces. This process is not service impacting or disruptive. 
    
   A modified SONET/SDH traffic parameter SHOULD have a different NCC 
   field and MAY have a different MT field. The RCC field may 
   indicate a different type of contiguous concatenation. The 
   multiplier field (MT) SHOULD not be used since it is used for a 
   different semantic. All other fields MUST be identical. 
    
7. SONET/SDH Traffic parameters 
    
   The GMPLS extensions for SONET/SDH [GMPLS-SONET-SDH] specify how 
   the SONET/SDH traffic parameters are encoded for both RSVP-TE and 
   CR-LDP. 
    
   For RSVP-TE, the SONET/SDH traffic parameters are carried in the 
   SONET/SDH SENDER_TSPEC and FLOWSPEC objects. The same format is 
   used for both objects. There is no Adpsec. 
    
   For CR-LDP, the SONET/SDH traffic parameters are carried in the 
   new SONET/SDH Traffic Parameters TLV. 
    
   GMPLS LBM explicitly allows the value of the traffic parameters to 
   change over time. A modified SONET/SDH traffic parameter indicates 
   the complete traffic parameters of the circuit and not a delta. 
   The delta computation is simply done by comparing the fields.
