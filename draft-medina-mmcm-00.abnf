   On the second step conformity is verified using three Token Buckets
   defined by a Committed Rate, a Peak Rate, a Maximum Rate and their
   corresponding burst sizes. If the incoming packet exceeds the MR it
   is immediately discarded. If the packet conforms to the MR but
   remains non- conforming to the PR it is marked as red. If the packet
   does not exceed the MR nor the PR but it is above the CR it is marked
   yellow. If the packet rate remains below the CR the packet obtains
   the green precedence. Finally, If the metering function results in
   demoting or dropping a green packet, the Reactive Box is informed.

   The mmCM always operates in color-aware mode. If a source can not
   assign different colors to its packets, all of them can be considered
   as green. This results in a behavior similar to a rate-controlled
   trTCM.



RL=2 a green drop is compensated by the preemption of 2 yellow
