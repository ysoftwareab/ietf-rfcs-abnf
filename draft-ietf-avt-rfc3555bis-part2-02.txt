Internet Draft   draft-ietf-avt-rfc3555bis-part2-02.txt October 15, 2006


1.  Introduction

This document updates the media type registrations initially specified
in RFC 3555 for the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) payload formats
defined in the RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences, RFC 3551
[1], as subtypes under the "audio" and "video" media types.  This
document does not include media type registrations for the RTP payload
formats that are referenced in RFC 3551 but defined in other RFCs.  The
media type registrations for those payload formats are intended to be
updated by including them in revisions of the individual RFCs defining
the payload formats.

The media type registrations specified here conform to the updated
template format and procedures in RFC 4288 [2] and RFC XXXX [3].  This
update makes no technical changes in the registrations.  Together with
RFC XXXX, this document obsoletes RFC 3555.

1.1.  IANA Considerations

As a consequence of the generalized applicability of the media types
registry as specified in RFC 4288, some changes in nomenclature are
needed in the RTP Payload Format section of the registry.  In the
registry title "RTP Payload Format MIME types" and the introductory
text, "MIME" should be changed to "media". "MIME" should be deleted from
the table headings, leaving just "media type" and "subtype".

This document updates the media type registrations listed below to
conform to the revised registration format specified in RFC 4288 and RFC
XXXX, so the reference for these media types should be changed from RFC
3555 to this document.  Some media type registrations contained in RFC
3555 are omitted from this document; the existing registrations for
those types continue to be valid until updated by other RFCs.  There are
no new registrations contained here.

Media type audio/L16 was initially registered via RFC 2586 for
transports other than RTP.  That registration is incorporated here and
augmented with additional information for RTP transport.

1.2.  Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [4] and indicate
requirement levels for implementations compliant with this
specification.

2.  Registrations for "Audio/Video Profile"

In the following sections, the RTP payload formats defined in the RTP
Profile for Audio and Video Conferences, RFC 3551 [1], are registered as
media types.

2.1.  Audio Type Registrations

For most audio payload formats, the RTP timestamp clock rate is equal to
the sampling rate.  Some payload formats operate only at one fixed
sampling rate, while others are adjustable.

These audio formats also include the optional parameters "ptime", to
specify the recommended length of time in milliseconds represented by

the media in a packet, and "maxptime", to specify the maximum amount of
media that can be encapsulated in each packet, expressed as time in
milliseconds.  The "ptime" and "maxptime" parameters are defined in the
Session Description Protocol (SDP), RFC ZZZZ [5].

2.1.1.  Registration of Media Type audio/DVI4

     Type name: audio

     Subtype name: DVI4

     Required parameters:
          rate: The RTP timestamp clock rate, which is equal to the
          sampling rate.  The typical rate is 8000, but other rates may
          be specified.

     Optional parameters: ptime, maxptime (see RFC ZZZZ)

     Encoding considerations:
          This media type is framed binary data (see Section 4.8 in RFC
          4288).

     Security considerations:
          This media type does not carry active content.  It does
          transfer compressed data.  See Section 4 of RFC YYYY.

     Interoperability considerations: none

     Published specification: RFC 3551

     Applications which use this media type:
          Audio and video streaming and conferencing tools.

     Additional information: none

     Person & email address to contact for further information:
          Stephen Casner <casner@acm.org>

     Intended usage: COMMON

     Restrictions on usage:
          This media type depends on RTP framing, and hence is only
          defined for transfer via RTP (RFC 3550 [6]).  Transfer within
          other framing protocols is not defined at this time.

2.1.15.  Registration of Media Type audio/L16

Media type audio/L16 was initially registered via RFC 2586 for
transports other than RTP.  That registration is incorporated here and
augmented with additional information for RTP transport.

     Type name: audio

Internet Draft   draft-ietf-avt-rfc3555bis-part2-02.txt October 15, 2006


     Subtype name: L16

     Required parameters
          rate: number of samples per second -- For non-RTP transport,
          the permissible values for rate are 8000, 11025, 16000, 22050,
          24000, 32000, 44100, and 48000 samples per second.  For RTP
          transport, other values are permissible but the aforementioned
          values are RECOMMENDED.  For RTP, the rate parameter indicates
          the RTP timestamp clock rate, which is equal to the sample
          rate.

     Optional parameters
          channels: how many audio streams are interleaved -- defaults
          to 1; stereo would be 2, etc.  Interleaving takes place
          between individual two-byte samples.  The channel order is as
          specified in RFC 3551 unless a channel-order parameter is also
          present.

          emphasis: analog preemphasis applied to the signal before
          quantization.  The only emphasis value defined here is
          emphasis=50-15 to indicate the 50/15 microsecond preemphasis
          used with Compact Disks.  This parameter MUST be omitted if no
          analog preemphasis was applied.  Note that this is a stream
          property parameter, not a receiver configuration parameter.
          Thus, if parameters are negotiated, it may not be possible for
          the sender to comply with a receiver request for a particular
          setting.

          channel-order: specifies the sample interleaving order for
          multiple-channel audio streams (see RFC 3190 [7] Section 7).
          Permissible values are DV.LRLsRs, DV.LRCS, DV.LRCWo,
          DV.LRLsRsC, DV.LRLsRsCS, DV.LmixRmixTWoQ1Q2,
          DV.LRCWoLsRsLmixRmix, DV.LRCWoLs1Rs1Ls2Rs2, DV.LRCWoLsRsLcRc.
          For interoperation with DV video systems, only a subset of
          these channel combinations is specified for use with 20-bit
          linear encoding in the DV video specification [9]; those are
          DV.LRLsRs, DV.LRCS, DV.LmixRmixTWoQ1Q2.  This parameter MUST
          be omitted when the AIFF-C channel order convention (see RFC
          3551) is in use.

          For RTP, ptime: RECOMMENDED duration of each packet in
          milliseconds.

          For RTP, maxptime: maximum duration of each packet in
          milliseconds.

     Encoding considerations
          Audio data is binary data, and must be encoded for non-binary

          transport; the Base64 encoding is suitable for Email.  Note
          that audio data does not compress easily using lossless
          compression.

     Security considerations
          Audio/L16 data is believed to offer no security risks.  This
          media type does not carry active content.  The encoding is not
          compressed.  See Section 4 of RFC YYYY.

     Interoperability considerations
          This type is compatible with the encoding used in the WAV
          (Microsoft Windows RIFF) and Apple AIFF union types, and with
          the public domain "sox" and "rateconv" programs.

     Published specification
          RFC 2586 for non-RTP transports, RFC 3551 for RTP

     Applications which use this media
          The public domain "sox" and "rateconv" programs accept this
          type.

          Magic number(s) : None

          It is expected that many audio and speech applications will
          use this type.  Already the most popular platforms provide
          this type with the rate=11025 parameter referred to as "radio
          quality speech."

     Restrictions on usage
          In addition to file-based transfer methods, this type is also
          defined for transfer via RTP (RFC 3550).

3.  Changes from RFC 3555

RFC 3555 is obsoleted by the combination of RFC XXXX [3] and this
document.  RFC XXXX retains the specification of procedures and
requirements from RFC 3555, while the media type registrations from RFC
3555 were extracted into this document.  The media type registrations
for the RTP payload formats that are referenced in RFC 3551 [1] but
defined in other RFCs have been elided from this document because those
registrations are intended to be updated by including them in revisions
of the individual RFCs defining the payload formats.

The media type registrations in this document have been updated to
conform to the revised media type registration procedures in RFC 4288
[2] and RFC XXXX.  Whereas RFC 3555 required the encoding considerations
to specify transfer via RTP, that is now specified under restrictions on
usage.  The encoding considerations now warn that these types are framed
binary data.  The change controller is also now identified according to
current conventions.  The optional parameter "channels" was clarified
for audio subtypes L8, PCMA, and PCMU.  Finally, reference [9], which
was missing from RFC 3555, has been corrected.

4.  Security Considerations

This memo specifies media type registrations for the transfer of several
compressed audio and video data encodings via RTP, so implementations
using these media types are subject to the security considerations
discussed in the RTP specification [8].

None of these media types carry "active content" that could impose
malicious side-effects upon the receiver.  The content consists solely
of compressed audio or video data to be decoded and presented as sound
or images.  However, several audio and video encodings are perfect for
hiding data using steganography.

A potential denial-of-service threat exists for data encodings using
compression techniques that have non-uniform receiver-end computational
load.  The attacker can inject pathological datagrams into the stream
which are complex to decode and cause the receiver to be overloaded.
However, none of the encodings registered here has an expansion factor
greater than about 20, and all are considered relatively simple by
modern standards (some are implemented on handheld devices and most were

implemented on general-purpose computers ten years ago).

As with any IP-based protocol, in some circumstances a receiver may be
overloaded simply by the receipt of too many packets, either desired or
undesired.  Network-layer authentication MAY be used to discard packets
from undesired sources, but the processing cost of the authentication
itself may be too high.

RTP may be sent via IP multicast, which provides no direct means for a
sender to know all the receivers of the data sent and therefore no
measure of privacy.  Rightly or not, users may be more sensitive to
privacy concerns with audio and video communication than they have been
with more traditional forms of network communication.  Therefore, the
use of security mechanisms with RTP to provide confidentiality and
integrity of the data is important.  Because the data compression used
with these media types is applied end-to-end, encryption may be
performed after compression so there is no conflict between the two
operations.
