          Multi-Transcoding Scenario          October 2005 
 
 
1. Introduction  
    
   Communication media is getting more diverse in terms of the types of 
   network terminals. Therefore, the era of new communication media 
   types through several kinds of network terminals such as hardware IP 
   phones and software IP phones, POTS phones, ISDN phones and mobile 
   phones has been coming. 
    
   We believe that transcoding services are a key solution to supporting 
   uncommon communication media in heterogeneous networks and different 
   capability terminals. Some examples of heterogeneous networks are 
   ones between PSTN and 3GPP/3GPP2, PSTN and Internet Telephony, or 
   Internet Telephony and 3GPP/3GPP2. Uncommon communication media can 
   occur with communication between voice and text, video/voice and 
   voice, or video/voice and text. Codec has adapted depending on 
   networks, media types, and applications. We need to define 
   transcoding error and scenario between different codecs for 
   BcN(broadband convergence network). 
    
   The speech codecs have been used in different networks according to 
   the network characteristics; G.711 in PSTN, AMR in GSM/3GPP, EVRC, 
   QCELP or SMV in 3GPP2. End users have adopted any codec since 
   internet phone; G.723.1, G.729, G.711, and internet Low Bit Rate 
   Codec (iLBC). ITSP(Internet Telephony Service Provider) tries to 
   provide a transcoding function for a wider service coverage. Thus, it 
   is possible to communicate between users with an uncommon codec. 
    
   A transcoding function is needed in cases of interworking between 
   different networks with different codecs and communicating between 
   different applications as well as case in support of deaf, hard of 
   hearing and speech-impaired individuals 
    
   The IETF sipping WG has been developing three models with SIP[1] for 
   transcoding services: ToIP(Text over IP), Third Party Call Control 
   Transcoding Model, and Conference Bridge Transcoding Model[3-8]. 
   Transcoding SHOULD apply by the principle based on SIP and SDP 
   Offer/Answer[2]. 
    
   This document presents miscellaneous transcoding error cases and the 
   multi-transcoding scenarios. The miscellaneous transcoding error can 
   occur when there is no common codec between two parties during 
   SIP/SDP codec negotiation and when there is inconsistent data between 
   signaling path and media path after SIP/SDP codec negotiation. The 
   inconsistency cases are caused by transcodec error itself, wrong 
   codec information delivery, protocol error between MG and MGC, MG/MGC 
   internal error, and unexpected exception error.

   The error cases and scenarios in this document are helpful for more 
   specifically defining error cause and/or a solution of ITSP 
   interworking. Scenarios are useful for network environment of 
   signaling/media path separation and multi-transcoding. 
    
    
2. Scope 
    
   This document is focused on error cases and scenarios for multi-
   transcoding. The cases and scenarios can be used in network 
   environments: broadband convergence networks with SIP based internet, 
   2G, 2.5G, 3G, CDMA, ISDN, and PSTN. 
    
   This document excludes SIP/SDP Codec OFFER/ANSWER, Codec format 
   Error, bit stream inconsistency between both sides, and connectivity 
   error.

5. Transcoding Error Cases 
    
   The transit party SHOULD provide all transcoding capability to the 
   calling party and called party during call negotiation in call set up 
   procedures[12-13]. This minimizes codec mismatch call setup failure 
   due to a lack of codec negotiation information. 
    
   A discriminator for codec characteristics SHOULD provide the 
   information whether it will be transcoded or not. The discriminator 
   prevents it from re-transcoding or transcoding-cycling occurring. 
   Transcoding can decrease the quality of the codec, so we SHOULD try 
   to minimize the number of transcodings if it is possible. A 
   preference order among candidate codecs SHOULD send to the other side 
   according to the quality of codec. The preference is useful for codec 
   negotiation during the call set up. 
   There are two paths at each node between calling party and called 
   party[15-16]. One is signaling path. The other is media path.  
    
   Client side has both of them in one physical entity, even though it 
   has two paths logically.  
   Intermediary node T has two separate paths logically and physically. 
   The signaling path will be located at T. The media path will be 
   located at T'. T negotiates supportable media to adjacent party by 
   SIP/SDP. T' supports media adjacent party by transcodec.  

   Data at T for negotiating MUST consist of supporting media at T'. The 
   method for consisting data between T and T' is beyond the scope of 
   this document. That can use H.248/MEGACO, MGCP, or internal 
   proprietary one.

   We are focused on ERROR Cases for transcoding service. If A receives 
   Not Acceptable Here: 488 after trying to B via T, A does not know 
   which is Not Acceptable Here, whether it occurred at T or B. The

   cases are helpful to know at which part an error occurred. The error 
   is different from 404: Not Found, 406: Not Acceptable, 415: 
   Unsupported Media Type, 500 Internal Server Error, 503 Service 
   Unavailable, and 606: Not Acceptable[1]. These are derived from 
   several steps during call setup sequences; destination finding step, 
   media type check step, codec negotiation step, media format and 
   decoding step, and etc. 
    
    
5.1 Not Acceptable at T and B: Nothing for A 
    
   If T and B can not support a codec, T SHOULD reply to A with Not 
   Acceptable:406 and Not transcoding supportable A at T after receiving 
   Not Acceptable Here: 488 from B.

5.3 Inconsistency calling side 
    
   After SIP media negotiation has finished successfully, this 
   inconsistency error case can occur during media communication between 
   calling sides. It is caused by inconsistency between T and T'. 
    
   This scenario does not mean RTP payload format error for a specific 
   codec and malfunction of T'.

6. Transcoding Scenario 
    
   We explain scenarios in network environment with one more transcoding 
   nodes. 
    
    
6.1 Transcoding Scenario 1 
    
   The T (Transcoding intermediary node) can send to called side party 
   with its transcoding capabilities based on received calling side 
   party media.  
    
   T1 sends to T2 the codec a from A and the Tb from T1. T2 sends to T3 
   the a from A, the Tb from T1, and the Tc from T2. T3 sends to B the a 
   from A, the Tb from T1, the Tc from T2, and the Td from T3.

                    Figure 6: Transcoding Scenario 1 
    
   T1 has the codec negotiation a between A and T1, Tb between T1 and 
   T2, Tc between T2 and T3, and Td between T3 and B. There are three 
   kinds of transcoding at both the signaling path and the media path 
   in this scenario. 
    
    
6.2 Transcoding Scenario 2 
    
   The T (Transcoding intermediary node) can send to called side party 
   with its transcoding capabilities based on received calling side 
   party media.

   T1 sends to T2 the a from A and the Tb from T1. T2 sends to T3 the a 
   from A, the Tb from T1, and the Tc from T2. T3 sends to B the a from 
   A, the Tb from T1, the Td from T3, and the Tc from T2.  
    
   T3 has the capability which transcode directly higher priority codec 
   a to another codec Td, so codec sequence is a, Tb, Td, Tc instead of 
   a, Tb, Tc, Td. This method is useful for minimizing the number of 
   transcodings.  
    
   We assume that transcoder decrease the original media quality.

   T3 has the codec negotiation a between A and T3, and Td between T3 
   and B, so A to T3 media path is a and T3 to B media path is d. T1 and 
   T2 has the bypass only capability at both of signaling path and media 
   path in this scenario. 
    
 
6.3 Transcoding Scenario 3 
    
   The T (Transcoding intermediary node) can send to called side party 
   with its transcoding capabilities based on received calling side 
   party media.  
    
   T1 sends to T2 the a from A and the Tb from T1. T2 sends to T3 the a 
   from A, the Tb from T1/T2, Tc from T2. T3 sends to B the a from A, 
   the Tb from T1/T2, and the Tc from T2/T3.  
    
   There are two kinds of priority decision methods. One is based on 
   first order; first order is first priority. The other is based on 
   quality; If T3 has two alternatives (one is a pair of wideband codec 
   a and narrowband codec Tb, the other is a pair of wideband codec a 
   and wideband codec Tc), so codec sequence is a, Tc, Tb instead of a,

   Tb, Tc. We can make quality the first priority and order sequence 
   second. 
    
   We assume that wideband codec has better quality than narrowband. We 
   do not consider the performance of transcoder: T1' a-b and T2' a-b 
   or T2' a-c and T3' a-c.

                    Figure 8: Transcoding Scenario 3 
    
   T3 has the codec negotiation a between A and T3, and Tc between T3 
   and B, so A to T3 media path is a and T3 to B media path is c. T1 and 
   T2 has the bypass only capability at both of signaling path and media 
   path in this scenario. 
    
   These scenarios effect Transcoding-cycling avoidance, minimizing of 
   transcoding, call setup delay, call waiting states during call set 
   up. 
   
    
7. The Maximum Tn of transcoding 
    
   We have to define the maximum number of Tn. The quality will be 
   decreased according to increase in the number of transcodings. We 
   SHOULD consider defining the maximum Tn for the protection of quality 
   deterioration and complex interoperability.

   The defining of maximum number Tn is for further study. This number 
   will be smaller than Max-Forwards in SIP Extension for Instant 
   Messaging[14].
