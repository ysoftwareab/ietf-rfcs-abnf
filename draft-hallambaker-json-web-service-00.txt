                 draft-hallambaker-json-web-service-00

Abstract

   The JSON Web Binding describes a standardized approach to
   implementing Web Services.  Services are advertised using the DNS SRV
   and HTTP Well Known Service conventions.  Messages may be
   authenticated or authenticated and encrypted at the message layer in
   addition to any transport and/or network layer security.  Service
   messages are encoded in JSON using Internet time format for Date-Time
   fields and Base64urlencoding for binary objects.

1.  Introduction

   The JSON Web Binding (JWB) specifies one approach to using DNS
   Discovery [RFC1035], the HTTP [RFC7230] protocol and the JSON data
   encoding [RFC7159] in a Web Service.

   JWB is not the only approach possible, but developing a standard
   means making choices that don?t matter to developers that build on
   it.  While there are infinitely many ways that a Web Service might
   employ HTTP and JSON to implement a Web Service, a client and a
   server can only interoperate if they both agree to use the same one.



      Discovery  Beginning with a DNS address of the service (e.g.
         example.com), the client identifies a specific HTTP URL at
         which to access the service.  The DNS SRV record [RFC2782] and
         Well Known Service [RFC5785] mechanisms are used for this
         purpose.

      Authentication and Encryption  Web Services MAY require
         authentication and encryption services at the message level
         even if transport layer security (e.g.  TLS [RFC5264]) is used.
         Use of such enhancements is signaled using the HTTP Content-
         Encoding header.

      Content Mapping  The mapping of data types described in the
         specification (integer, string, etc.) to JSON data types.
         [RFC3339] Date time encoding and BASE64-url encoding [RFC4648]
         are used to map date-time and binary data types to JSON
         encoding values.

   A key architectural principle that guides the design of JWB is that
   the Web Service application should be as independent of the HTTP
   presentation layer as is possible.  Thus:

   Message semantics are not affected by HTTP headers or the request
   line URL.

   The use of HTTP response codes is limited to reporting errors and
   warnings that arise from the HTTP transport.

   If message layer authentication or authenticated encryption are used,
   this is applied within the HTTP content payload and not through a
   combination of payload and header data.

2.  Definitions

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Service Discovery

   Service discovery is the process of resolving the address of a Web
   Service to a Web Service Endpoint, a URI [RFC3986] at which the
   service is provided.

   A JWB Web Service is specified by giving the DNS Address of the
   service (e.g. example.com), the protocol name (e.g. mmm) and the
   transport (usually tcp).

3.1.  SRV Lookup

   A client attempting to connect to the service first attempts to
   locate an SRV record [RFC2782] for the specified service.

   To resolve the web service in the previous example, the client
   attempts to resolve the DNS SRV records for _mmm._tcp.example.com.

   If a match is found, the client uses the mechanism specified in
   [RFC2782] to choose hosts and attempts to contact each host in turn
   until a successful HTTP connection is established or the maximum
   number of attempts threshold is reached.

3.2.  DNS Fallback

   If no SRV record is found, a client MAY perform fallback discovery if
   explicitly authorized to do so by the corresponding Web Service
   protocol specification.  The client attempts to connect to the host .

   In the previous example, the client would attempt to connect to
   mmm.example.com.

3.3.  .well-known

   A Web Service host typically supports multiple Web Services.  The
   Well Known Services convention is used to specify the URL stem at the
   site.

   Note that in theory a Web Service could have a Well Known Services
   entry that is different to the SRV extension.  Particularly as the

   requirements for registration in the SRV registry are considerably
   looser (first come first served) than for the Well Known Services
   registry (expert review).  This is of course utterly ridiculous.

4.  HTTP Messages

   JWB makes

4.1.  Request

4.2.  Response

5.  Content Encoding

   The HTTP Content-Encoding header specifies transformations performed
   on the content before the HTTP Transfer encoding was applied.  This
   is commonly used for specifying compression.  In JWB,

   May be direct or include cryptographic enhancement.

   The ASCII Record Separator Character (%x1E) is used to separate
   segments in a multipart encoding.  This follows the practice
   established for JSON log files [RFC7464].

5.1.  Direct

5.2.  Authenticated

5.3.  Authenticated Encryption

6.  Content Type

6.1.  JSON
