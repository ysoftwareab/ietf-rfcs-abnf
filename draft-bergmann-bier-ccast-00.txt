1.  Introduction

   As defined in [RFC6550], RPL Multicast assumes that the RPL network
   operates in Storing Mode.  Multicast DAOs are used to indicate
   subscription to multicast address to a parent; these DAOs percolate
   up and create bread-crumbs.  This specification, although part of RFC
   6550, appears to be incomplete and untested.  More importantly,
   Storing Mode is not in use in constrained node networks outside
   research operating environments.

   The present specification addresses multicast forwarding for RPL
   networks in the much more common Non-Storing Mode.  Non-Storing is
   based on the root node adding source-routing information to downward
   packets.  Evidently, to make this work, RPL multicast needs to
   source-route multicast packets.  A source route here is a list of
   outgoing interfaces, which subsets the whole set of potential
   forwarders available in the RPL DODAG to those that need to forward
   in order to reach known multicast listeners.

   Including an actual list of outgoing interfaces is rarely applicable,
   as this is likely to be a large list of 16-byte IPv6 addresses.  Even
   with [RFC6554] style compression, the size of the list becomes
   prohibitively quickly.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  The BIER Approach

   Bit-Indexed Explicit Replication [I-D.wijnands-bier-architecture]
   lists all egress routers in a bitmap included in each multicast
   packet.  This requires creating a mostly contiguous numbering of all
   egress routers; more importantly, BIER requires the presence of a
   network map in each forwarders to be able to interpret the bitmap and
   map it to a set of local outgoing interfaces.

3.  The Constrained-Cast Approach

   Constrained-Cast employs Bloom Filters [BLOOM] as a compact
   representation of a match or non-match for elements in a large set:
   Each element to be included is hashed with multiple hash functions;
   the result is used to index a bitmap and set the corresponding bit.
   To check for the presence of an element, the same hash functions are
   applied to obtain bit positions; if all corresponding bits are set,
   this is used to indicate a match.  (Multiple hash functions are most
   easily obtained by adding a varying seed value to a single hash
   algorithm.)

   By including a bloom filter in each packet that matches all outgoing
   interfaces that need to forward the packet, each forwarder can
   efficiently decide whether (and on which interfaces) to forward the
   packet.

4.  False Positives

   Bloom filters are probabilistic.  A false positive might be
   indicating a match where the bits are set by aliasing of the hash
   values.  In case of Constrained-Cast, this causes spurious
   transmission and wastes some energy and radio bandwidth.  However,
   there is no semantic damage (hosts still filter out unneeded
   multicasts).  The total waste in energy and spectrum can be
   visualized as the false-positive-rate multiplied by the density of
   the RPL network.  A network can easily live with a significant
   percentage of false positives.  By changing the set of hash functions
   (i.e., seed) over time, the root can avoid a single node with a false
   positive to become an unnecessary hotspot for that multicast group.

5.  Protocol

   The protocol uses DAO-like "MLAO" messages to announce membership to
   the root.  (To do: write up the format, which should be pretty much
   obvious anyway.)

   For downward messages, the root adds a new routing header that
   includes a hash function identifier and a seed value; another one of

   its fields gives the number of hash functions (k) to ask for k
   instances of application of the hash function, with increasing seed.

   Typical sizes of the bloom filter bitmap that the root inserts into
   the packet can be 64, 128, or 256 bit, with acceptable false positive
   rates for total numbers of forwarders in the 10s and 100s.  (To do:
   write more about the math here.  Note that this number tallies
   forwarding routers, not end hosts.)

   A potential forwarder that receives a multicast packet adorned with a
   constrained-cast routing header first checks that the packet is
   marked with a RPL rank smaller than its own (loop prevention).  If
   yes, it then forwards the packet to all outgoing interfaces that
   match the bloom filter in the packet.

6.  Implementation

   In 2013, Constrained-Cast was implemented in Contiki.  It turns out
   that forwarders can compute the hash functions once for their
   outgoing interfaces and then cache them, simply bit-matching their
   outgoing interface hash bits against the bloom filter in the packet
   (a match is indicated when all bits in the outgoing interface hash
   are set in the bloom filter).

   The Root computes the tree for each multicast group, computes the
   bloom filter for it, caches these values, and then simply adds the
   bloom filter routing header to each downward packet.  For adding a
   new member, the relevant outgoing interfaces are simply added to the
   bloom filter.  For removing a leaving member, however, the bloom
   filter needs to be recomputed (which can be sped up logarithmically
   if desired).

7.  Benefits

   Constrained-Cast:

   o  operates in Non-Storing Mode, with the simple addition of a
      membership information service;

   o  performs all routing decisions at the root.

   Further optimizations might include using a similar kind of bloom
   filter routing header for unicast forwarding as well (representing,
   instead of the outgoing interface list, a list of children that
   forwarding parents need to forward to).
