Internet-Draft       Network Management SRV Records        November 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies how to use Domain Name Service (DNS) SRV
   Resource Records (RRs) [RFC2782] to locate network management
   services.  The use of SRV RRs can be useful in network bootstrapping
   scenarios or in zero-configuration network scenarios (e.g., home
   networks).

   The network management DNS SRV RRs defined in this memo may be used
   for different purposes:

   o  Manageable devices announce their management interfaces using a
      multicast DNS service.  A management system discovers the devices
      and initiates management interactions with them.

   o  Devices discover destinations for event notifications or logging
      services by looking up (statically) configured SRV RRs in the DNS.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  SRV Service Labels

2.1.  SYSLOG

   The Reliable Delivery of syslog specification [RFC3195] mentions the
   usage of DNS SRV RRs to locate SYSLOG collectors.  The more recent
   SYSLOG protocol specification [RFC5424] and the associated transport
   mappings ([RFC5425], [RFC5426], [RFC6012]) do not discuss the usage
   of SRV RRs to locate SYSLOG collectors.  This specification takes the
   service label definition from [RFC3195] and makes it applicable to
   structured SYSLOG as defined in [RFC5424]:

   _syslog     Identifies a SYSLOG collector.  This SRV RR is primarily
               for discovery of SYSLOG collectors by SYSLOG originators
               or relays.

   Example: service records

               _syslog._tcp    SRV 0 1 6514 syslog.example.com.
               _syslog._udp    SRV 0 1  514 syslog.example.com.

   A SYSLOG originator may need additional information to send SYSLOG
   messages to a SYSLOG collector.  How this information is derived is
   not specified and implementation dependent.

2.2.  SNMP

   The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) [RFC3410] distinguishes
   between SNMP entities containing command responder and notification
   originator applications (traditionally called agents) and SNMP
   entities containing command generator and/or notification receiver
   applications (traditionally called a managers) [RFC3411].  This
   specification defines two new SRV service labels for SNMP:

   _snmp       Identifies an SNMP entity containing a command responder
               application.  This record is primarily for discovery of
               SNMP agents that announce their presence using multicast
               DNS protocols.

   _snmp-trap  Identifies an SNMP entity containing a notification
               receiver application.  This SRV RR is primarily for
               discovery of SNMP notification sinks by SNMP notification
               generator applications.

   Example: service records

               _snmp._udp         SRV 0 1 161 device.example.com.
               _snmp-trap._udp    SRV 0 1 162 nms.example.com.

   An SNMP engine containing a command generator application needs
   additional information to send SNMP messages to a SNMP engine
   containing a command responder application.  How this information is
   derived is not specified and implementation dependent.  Similarily,
   an SNMP engine containing a notification originator application needs
   additional information to send SNMP messages to a SNMP engine
   containing a notification receiver application.  How this information
   is derived is not specified and implementation dependent.

2.3.  NETCONF

   The NECONF protocol [RFC4741] provides mechanisms to install,
   manipulate, and delete the configuration of network devices.  The
   mandatory to implement transport uses the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol
   [RFC4742].  SSH sessions are always initiated by the NETCONF client.
   This specification adds a new SRV service label for NETCONF:

   _netconf    Identifies a NETCONF server.  This record is primarily
               for discovery of NETCONF servers that announce their
               presence using multicast DNS protocols.

   Example: service records

               _netconf._tcp    SRV 0 1 830 device.example.com.

   A NETCONF client needs additional information in order to establish a
   session with a NETCONF server.  How this information is derived is
   not specified and implementation dependent.


3.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations spelled out in the DNS SRV specification
   [RFC2782] apply.  In general, the usage of DNSSEC [RFC4033] is
   recommended in environments where DNS cannot be trusted.

   The usage of multicast DNS protocols to discover network management
   services potentially introduces new security risks since such
   protocols usually assume cooperating participants.  In an environment
   where antagonistic participants exists, it is necessary to deploy
   additional security mechanism such as DNSSEC to securely discover
   network management services.


4.  IANA Considerations

   TBD

Appendix A.  Open Issues

   1.  draft-gudmundsson-dns-srv-iana-registry-04 proposes a template
       for registering SRV names.  We may have to use this format in
       case draft-gudmundsson-dns-srv-iana-registry-04 moves forward.

   2.  draft-hallambaker-esrv-00 proposes a mechanism to store
       additional information in so called ESRV records (e.g., which
       security protocol to use).  This is traditionally done using TXT
       records.

   3.  draft-gudmundsson-dnsext-srv-clarify describes extended service
       labels that may be used to identify security protocols that are
       located between the management protocol and the transport
       protocol.  This may be adopted to identify TLS/DTLS/SSH usage to
       secure management protocols.
