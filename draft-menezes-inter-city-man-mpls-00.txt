   for MAN providers by using a distance-insensitive IP Network Service 
   Provider (NSP) as a WAN partner for inter-city services.  It 
   simplifies MAN operation and improves the scalability of a 
   traditional standard overlay model by allowing the MAN provider to 
   peer to the NSP for both Internet transit and inter-city MAN 
   services (e.g., TLS).  This network service model allows an NSP to 
   offer hierarchical MPLS services to downstream providers while 
   providing scalability and automation for both the NSP and MAN 
   provider.  While this document refers to a solution for MAN 
   providers, any downstream provider that needs hierarchical MPLS 
   services from an NSP can use this service.

   2 Introduction 
    
   MAN service providers deliver high-speed network connectivity to 
   businesses in a metropolitan area.  Many businesses have multiple 
   office locations in one city or in several cities scattered in 
   different geographical regions.  With more capacity available in the 
   NSPs that span multiple geographical regions and lower costs for 
   long-distance IP services, there is an opportunity for MAN service 
   providers to extend enterprise networks for these businesses by 
   providing seamless connectivity regardless of whether the 
   communication is intra-city or inter-city.  
    
   To provide such services, one possibility for a MAN service provider 
   is to lease circuit networks, such as Frame Relay or ATM from some 
   Frame Relay or ATM WAN service provider(s) and then use these 
   circuits to carry inter-city traffic.  But it is costly to lease 
   large-circuit bandwidth over long distances, and it is complex to 
   operate both MAN and WAN networks from end to end.

   To reduce costs and complexity, one might consider IP NSPs for 
   inter-city connectivity.  NSP IP network services are typically 
   distance-insensitive.  To traffic engineer the network and to 
   provide QoS, VPN, and other services, a possible approach for the 
   MAN provider is to use the overlay model (see Figure 1) where 
   explicitly routed MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs)are established 
   end to end to form a full-mesh virtual network on top of the 
   underlying network provided by the NSP.  However, this approach 
   raises scalability concerns because it requires N^2 square number of 
   LSPs(where N is the number of cities being connected), with routers 
   at the end of these LSPs having routing peering with each other; and 
   it demands configuration changes at all cities when a new city is 
   added.  Also, the MAN service provider would need to design and 
   operate routing that spans not just individual cities but the wide 
   area as well.

   We propose a peering model (see Figure 2) that improves the 
   scalability of the overlay model, reduces the operating cost of MAN 
   providers, and pushes the complexity of operating an inter-city WAN 
   backbone to NSP partners.  In the peering model, a MAN router (CE) 
   that connects the MAN to a WAN has routing peering not with MAN 
   routers in other cities but with a WAN router (PE).  As a result of 
   this peering, the MAN router receives routing information for other

   cities, even if the router doesnÆt have routing peering with MAN 
   routers in these cities.  In addition, the NSP creates a collection 
   of ôsink trees,ö where each tree is rooted at a particular city with 
   the rest of the cities forming leaves of that tree.  By using the 
   hierarchical VPN approach described in [2], the NSP could support 
   multiple MAN providers.  Moreover, by using the concept of MPLS 
   label stacking, each MAN provider could establish LSPs and 
   interconnect routers in different cities without introducing 
   additional routing/forwarding overhead on the NSP.  Finally, the MAN 
   provider could use MPLS label stacking to further reduce 
   routing/forwarding overhead within each MAN area.

   3 Inter-City MAN Peering Model and Framework 
    
   To accommodate these requirements, this document proposes that a VPN 
   hierarchical model be used, a model in which the lower hierarchy is 
   operated by the NSP and the higher hierarchy is made up of inter-
   city MAN services operated by the MAN provider.  The generation of 
   these lower hierarchical connections is the responsibility of the 
   NSP and are coordinated with the MAN provider via an automated 
   procedure (which is the purpose of this document).   
    
   This document focuses on MPLS as the technology for hierarchical 
   capability, the use of RFC 2547bis [2] as the mechanism that the NSP 
   would use internally to offer VPN services to the MAN provider, and 
   the use of BGP [3] to exchange both the routing and label 
   information between the NSP and the MAN provider.  An automated 
   procedure, which is based on the mechanisms described in [2] and 
   [3], automates the NSPÆs generation of inter-city LSPs that can be 
   used by the MAN provider.  Other mechanisms and standards that can 
   be used to accommodate these same requirements are for future study.

                   Figure 3. Inter-City MAN Peering Model 
    
   In Figure 3, the NSP PE routers that connect to the MAN at each city 
   form peering relationships with the MAN routers (e.g., PE1 forms 
   routing peering with CE1) (this is a function of the NSPÆs VPN 
   services using RFC 2547bis [2]).  While the MAN provider may be 
   under the same administrative control for each city, we assume that 
   the MAN in each city forms a separate IGP domain.  The MAN CE 
   router(s) in a given city exchanges only with the PE router(s) of 
   the NSP routes and labels for the destinations that originate from 
   that city. 
    
   When a city is added to the network, the CE router automatically 
   advertises to the NSP PE its routes for the destinations in that 
   city, as well as labels for these routes, by using BGP [3].  The NSP 
   PE routers in turn distribute the routes to their PE peers through 
   BGP, and each PE peer further delivers the routes to other CE 
   routers.  Other citiesÆ CE routers that are in the same virtual 
   private network as the new CE router will receive announcement of 
   the new CE router and, therefore, have an LSP connection back to 
   this new CE router and to other destinations reachable through this 
   router (these are the destinations in the city to which the router 
   belongs).  Thus, LSPs among CE routers are automatically 
   established, and these LSPs could be used by the inter-city MAN 
   services.  It is important to note that these inter-city LSPs that 
   are generated by the NSP are hierarchical in nature, in the sense 
   that they could be used to carry all kinds of traffic, including 
   another higher-level LSP (which could be signaled by RSVP-TE or LDP) 
   or IP traffic or both.  Moreover, the procedures/protocols for 
   establishing the LSPs at one level of the hierarchy (e.g., inter-
   city service LSPs) need not be the same as the procedures/protocols 
   for establishing the LSPs at other levels of the hierarchy (e.g., 
   inter-city LSPs). 
    
    
   3.1 Inter-City MAN LSP Hierarchical Model 
    
   It is important to note the scalability achieved through 
   hierarchical LSPs.  For example, as shown in Figure 4, Ps of NSP 
   network only need to store labels to reach its PEs.  These PEs only 
     
   Menezes        Internet Draft - Expires May 2002                 6 
   Internet Draft   Inter-City MAN Services Using MPLS   November 2001 
    
   need to know how to reach the corresponding CEs that it services.  
   It is not necessary for the NSPÆs PEs to understand or care about 
   the inter-city service LSPs of the MAN providers.  The PEs in the 
   NSPÆs network do not see any label stack other than the inter-city 
   LSP.  Therefore, when a MAN provider creates an inter-city service 
   from one city to another across the NSP, the NSP has no state 
   information for that LSP (this is assuming that the inter-city 
   service LSP is created by using RSVP-TE).  Therefore, an NSP for a 
   given PE can accommodate many MAN customers in a scalable fashion. 
    
   Moreover, an inter-city service LSP could be used by a MAN provider 
   to offer services, such as Layer 2 VPNs, to multiple customers, thus 
   further improving the scalability of the approach.

   An important aspect of this service is for the NSP to offer CoS 
   capabilities so that SLAs within a MAN providerÆs city also can be 
   honored for inter-city services.  To achieve this requirement, the 
   markings of any higher-level LSP (or IP packet) SHOULD be propagated 
   to lower-layer LSPs, including traffic-engineered LSPs that are 
   within the NSPÆs network.  This functionality offers great 
   scalability because as each packet (IP or MPLS) enters the NSPs 
   network, it carries with it a marking that indicates which CoS PHB 
   [diff serv] it needs.  Therefore, the propagation of the marking 
   from higher-layer services to lower-layer LSPs is completely

   feasible as long as a MAN provider enters into a bilateral CoS 
   agreement with the NSP by specifying the behavior of each CoS 
   marking.  Future work will describe how a hard QoS model can also be 
   achieved using a similar process.

   4 Technical Details  
    
    
    
   As we mentioned above, the inter-city LSPs are created by following 
   the procedures described in Section 9 of [2].  In addition, this 
   document assumes that BGP is used as the protocol for exchanging 
   routing and label information between the PEs of the WAN provider 
   and the CE-ASBRs of the MAN provider (as specified in [3]).  Note 
   that when a CE-ASBR advertises a route to a WANÆs PE, the label 
   associated with this route should be Implicit NULL. 
    
   This document assumes that the inter-city service LSPs are 
   established by using RSVP-TE.  The RSVP-TE setups for these LSPs are 
   carried by the NSP (including the ingress and egress PEs of the NSP) 
   as plain data; neither the ingress nor the egress PE create any RSVP 
   and/or labeling states for these setups.  Doing this avoids the need 
   for the NSP to maintain state on a per inter-city service LSP basis. 
    
   The setups create RSVP and label state on the routers within MAN, 
   including the routers (CEs) that peer with the NSP routers but not 
   on any of the NSPÆs routers. 
    
   With respect to how one would construct the Explicit Route Object 
   (ERO) carried by the setups, there are several options.  One option 
   is for the MAN service provider to use some off-line tool to compute 
   the EROs for the inter-city service LSPs.  Another alternative is to 
   compute the ERO on a per MAN basis.  Using the example shown in 
   Figure 4, with this alternative, PE1 in MAN1 would compute the ERO

   for the segment of the path through MAN1, and CE2-ASBR would compute 
   the ERO for the segment of the path through MAN2.  
    
   For the purpose of handling the ERO carried in the setups, one 
   alternative is to assume that the MAN routers that peer with the NSP 
   routers are treated as being one hop away from each other.  Using 
   the example shown in Figure 4, for the purpose of handling the ERO 
   carried by the RSVP-TE setup for an inter-city service LSP from PE1 
   in MAN1 to PE2 in MAN2, CE1-ASBR and CE2-ASBR are treated as being 
   one hop from each other.  
    
   Another alternative for handling the ERO is to require that the 
   originator of an inter-city service LSP specify the hop over the NSP 
   network as a loose one.  Again, using the example shown in Figure 4, 
   PE1 in MAN1 would specify CE2-ASBR as a loose hop in the ERO. 
    
    
   5 Example of Operations 
    
   Consider the following topology 
    
        AS1 (MAN)  |  AS2 (WAN)   |  AS3 (MAN) 
    
      R1---R2---R3---R4--....--R5---R6---R7---R8 
    
   where AS2 provides WAN VPN services to a MAN service provider 
   composed of AS1 and AS3.  The routing protocol between R3 and R4 is 
   eBGP.  The same is true for R5 and R6.  
    
   R6 advertises to R5 (via eBGP) a single address prefix ("AS3 prefix") 
   that covers all the destinations in AS3 with itself as a next hop.  
   R6 advertises the "AS3 prefix" to R5 with an Implicit NULL label.  R5 
   advertises this prefix to R4 with label L2 and next-hop R5.  R4 
   advertises the prefix to R3 with label L1 and next-hop R4.  With this 
   in mind, the following illustrates MPLS forwarding associated with 
   the inter-city LSP (LSP from R3 to R6). 
    
        LSR     dest    action 
         
        R3      "AS3"   push L1 
        R4      L1      swap L1 with L2; push <something to reach R5> 
        R5      L2      pop L2, forward to R6 
         
   For the inter-city service LSP (R1-R8), the RSVP hops are R1, R2, R3, 
   R6, R7, and R8.  R{2,3,6,7} send RSVP labels M{1,2,3,4}, 
   respectively, to the previous hop.  With this in mind, the following 
   illustrates MPLS forwarding associated with the inter-city service 
   LSP (LSP from R1 to R8). 
 
          LSR   dest    action 
         
          R1    R8      push M1

          R2    M1      swap M1 with M2 
          R3    M2      swap M2 with M3; push L1 
          R4    L1      swap L1 with L2; push <something to reach R5> 
          R5    L2      pop L2, forward to R6 (top label is now M3) 
          R6    M3      swap with M4 
          R7    M4      PHP/explicit null 
          R8    -       - 
            
            
   6 Security Considerations 
    
   This document does not affect the underlying security issues of 
   MPLS and does not introduce any security considerations that are not 
   already part of the existing usage for LSPs.
