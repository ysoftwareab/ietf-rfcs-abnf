       Constrained Voucher Artifacts for Bootstrapping Protocols
                draft-ietf-anima-constrained-voucher-00

Abstract

   This document defines a strategy to securely assign a pledge to an
   owner, using an artifact signed, directly or indirectly, by the
   pledge's manufacturer.  This artifact is known as a "voucher".

   This document builds upon the work in [RFC8366], encoding the
   resulting artifact in CBOR.  Use with two signature technologies are
   described.

   Additionally, this document explains how constrained vouchers may be
   transported in the [I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est] protocol.

1.  Introduction

   Enrollment of new nodes into constrained networks with constrained
   nodes present unique challenges.

   There are bandwidth and code space issues to contend.  A solution
   such as [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] may be too large in
   terms of code space or bandwidth required.

   This document defines a constrained version of [RFC8366].  Rather
   than serializing the YANG definition in JSON, it is serialized into
   CBOR ([RFC7049]).

   This document follows a similar, but not identical structure as
   [RFC8366].  Some sections are left out entirely.  Additional sections
   have been added concerning:

   1.  Addition of voucher-request specification as defined in
       [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra],

   2.  Addition to [I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est] of voucher transport requests
       over coap.

   The CBOR definitions for this constrained voucher format are defined
   using the mechanism describe in [I-D.ietf-core-yang-cbor] using the
   SID mechanism explained in [I-D.ietf-core-sid].  As the tooling to
   convert YANG documents into an list of SID keys is still in its
   infancy, the table of SID values presented here should be considered
   normative rather than the output of the pyang tool.

   Two methods of signing the resulting CBOR object are described in
   this document:

   1.  One is CMS [RFC5652].

   2.  The other is COSE [RFC8152] signatures.

Internet-Draft            Constrained Vouchers                  May 2018


2.  Terminology

   The following terms are defined in [RFC8366], and are used
   identically as in that document: artifact, imprint, domain, Join
   Registrar/Coordinator (JRC), Manufacturer Authorized Signing
   Authority (MASA), pledge, Trust of First Use (TOFU), and Voucher.

3.  Requirements Language

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119] and indicate requirement levels for compliant STuPiD
   implementations.

4.  Survey of Voucher Types

   [RFC8366] provides for vouchers that assert proximity, that
   authenticate the registrar and that include different amounts of
   anti-replay protection.

   This document does not make any extensions to the types of vouchers.

   Time based vouchers are included in this definition, but given that
   constrained devices are extremely unlikely to know the correct time,
   their use is very unlikely.  Most users of these constrained vouchers
   will be online and will use live nonces to provide anti-replay
   protection.

   [RFC8366] defined only the voucher artifact, and not the Voucher
   Request artifact, which was defined in
   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra].

   This document defines both a constrained voucher and a constrained
   voucher-request.  They are presented in the order voucher-request,
   followed by voucher response as this is the time order that they
   occur.

5.  Discovery and URI

   This section describes the BRSKI extensions to EST-coaps
   [I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est] to transport the voucher between registrar,
   proxy and pledge over CoAP.

   The extension is targeted to low-resource networks with small
   packets.  Saving header space is important and the EST-coaps URI is
   shorter than the EST URI.

Internet-Draft            Constrained Vouchers                  May 2018


   The presence and location of (path to) the management data are
   discovered by sending a GET request to "/.well-known/core" including
   a resource type (RT) parameter with the value "ace.est" [RFC6690].
   Upon success, the return payload will contain the root resource of
   the EST resources.  It is up to the implementation to choose its root
   resource; throughout this document the example root resource /est is
   used.

   The EST-coaps server URIs differ from the EST URI by replacing the
   scheme https by coaps and by specifying shorter resource path names:

     coaps://www.example.com/est/short-name

   Figure 5 in section 3.2.2 of [RFC7030] enumerates the operations and
   corresponding paths which are supported by EST.  Table 1 provides the
   mapping from the BRSKI extension URI path to the EST-coaps URI path.

                     +------------------+-----------+
                     | BRSKI            | EST-coaps |
                     +------------------+-----------+
                     | /requestvoucher  | /rv       |
                     |                  |           |
                     | /voucher-status  | /vs       |
                     |                  |           |
                     | /enrollstatus    | /es       |
                     |                  |           |
                     | /requestauditlog | /ra       |
                     +------------------+-----------+

                   Table 1: BRSKI path to EST-coaps path

   /requestvoucher and /enrollstatus are needed between pledge and
   Registrar.

   When discovering the root path for the EST resources, the server MAY
   return the full resource paths and the used content types.  This is
   useful when multiple content types are specified for EST-coaps
   server.  The example below shows the discovery of the presence and
   the location of voucher resources.

     REQ: GET /.well-known/core?rt=ace.est

     RES: 2.05 Content
     </est>; rt="ace.est"
     </est/rv>; ct=50 TBD2 TBD3 16
     </est/vs>; ct=50
     </est/es>; ct=50
     </est/ra>; ct=TBD2 TBD3 16

   The first line MUST be returned in response to the GET, The following
   four lines MAY be returned to show the supported Content-Formats.
   The return of the content-types allows the client to choose the most
   appropriate one from multiple content types.

   ct=50 stands for the Content-Format "application/json", ct=16 stands
   for the Content-Format "application/cose; cose-type="cose-encrypt0",
   ct=TBD2 stands for Content-Format "application/voucher-cms+cbor,
   ct=TBD3 stands for Content-Format "application/voucher-cose+cbor;
   cose-type="cose-sign1.  The latter two are defined in this document.

6.  Artifacts

   This section describes the abstract (tree) definition as explained in
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-tree-diagrams] first.  This provides a high-
   level view of the contents of each artifact.

   Then the assigned SID values are presented.  These have been assigned
   using the rules in [I-D.ietf-core-yang-cbor], with an allocation that
   was made via the http://comi.space service.

   ((EDNOTE: it is unclear if there is further IANA work))

   "augmented" such that one continuous set of SID values is generated
   for the cwt-voucher-request module name, all voucher attributes, and
   the cwt-voucher-request attribute.

6.1.4.  Example voucher request artifacts

   TBD

6.2.  Voucher artifact

   The voucher's primary purpose is to securely assign a pledge to an
   owner.  The voucher informs the pledge which entity it should
   consider to be its owner.

   This document defines a voucher that is a CBOR encoded instance of
   the YANG module defined in Section 5.3 that has been signed with CMS
   or with COSE.

6.2.3.  YANG Module

   In the cwt-voucher YANG module, the voucher is "used" and not
   "augmented" such that one continuous set of SID values is generated
   for the cwt-voucher module name, all voucher attributes, and the cwt-
   voucher attribute.

    "This module defines the format for a voucher, which is produced by
     a pledge's manufacturer or delegate (MASA) to securely assign one
     or more pledges to an 'owner', so that the pledges may establish a
     secure connection to the owner's network infrastructure.

     This version provides a very restricted subset appropriate
     for very constrained devices.
     In particular, it assumes that nonce-ful operation is
     always required, that expiration dates are rather weak, as no
     clocks can be assumed, and that the Registrar is identified
     by a pinned Raw Public Key.

     The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT',
     'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in
     the module text are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.";

6.3.  Signing of voucher and voucher-request artifacts

   The IETF evolution of PKCS#7 is CMS [RFC5652].  The CMS signed
   voucher is much like the equivalent voucher defined in [RFC8366].

   A different eContentType of TBD1 is used to indicate that the
   contents are in a different format than in [RFC8366].

Internet-Draft            Constrained Vouchers                  May 2018


   The ContentInfo structure contains a payload consisting of the CBOR
   encoded voucher.  The [I-D.ietf-core-yang-cbor] use of delta encoding
   creates a canonical ordering for the keys on the wire.  This
   canonical ordering is not important as there is no expectation that
   the content will be reproduced during the validation process.

   Normally the recipient is the pledge and the signer is the MASA.

   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] supports both signed and
   unsigned voucher requests from the pledge to the JRC.  In this
   specification, voucher-request artifact is not signed from the pledge
   to the registrar.  From the JRC to the MASA, the voucher-request
   artifact MUST be signed by the domain owner key which is requesting
   ownership.

6.3.1.  CMS signing

   The considerations of [RFC5652] section 5.1, concerning validating
   CMS objects which are really PKCS7 objects (cmsVersion=1) applies.

   The CMS structure SHOULD also contain all the certificates leading up
   to and including the signer's trust anchor certificate known to the
   recipient.  The inclusion of the trust anchor is unusual in many
   applications, but without it third parties can not accurately audit
   the transaction.

   The CMS structure MAY also contain revocation objects for any
   intermediate certificate authorities (CAs) between the voucher-issuer
   and the trust anchor known to the recipient.  However, the use of
   CRLs and other validity mechanisms is discouraged, as the pledge is
   unlikely to be able to perform online checks, and is unlikely to have
   a trusted clock source.  As described below, the use of short-lived
   vouchers and/or pledge provided nonce provides a freshness guarantee.

6.3.2.  COSE signing

   The COSE-Sign1 structure discussed in section 4.2 of [RFC8152].  The
   CBOR object that carries the body, the signature, and the information
   about the body and signature is called the COSE_Sign1 structure.  It
   is used when only one signature is used on the body.  The signature
   algorithm is ECSDA with three curves P-256, P-384, and P-512.

   Support for EdDSA is encouraged

7.  Design Considerations

   The design considerations for the CBOR encoding of vouchers is much
   the same as for [RFC8366].

   One key difference is that the names of the leaves in the YANG does
   not have a material effect on the size of the resulting CBOR, as the
   SID translation process assigns integers to the names.

8.  Security Considerations

8.1.  Clock Sensitivity

   TBD.

8.2.  Protect Voucher PKI in HSM

   TBD.

8.3.  Test Domain Certificate Validity when Signing

   TBD.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers two URIs in the IETF XML registry [RFC3688].
   Following the format in [RFC3688], the following registration is
   requested:

     URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-cwt-voucher
     Registrant Contact: The ANIMA WG of the IETF.
     XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   EDNOTE: should a separate value be used for Voucher Requests?

9.4.  The SID registry

   The SID range 1001100 was allocated by comi.space to the IETF-CWT-
   VOUCHER yang module.

   The SID range 1001150 was allocated by comi.space to the IETF-CWT-
   VOUCHER-REQUEST yang module.

   EDNOTE: it is unclear if there is further IANA work required.

   This section registers the 'application/voucher-cms+cbor' media type
   and the 'application/voucher-cose+cbor'in the "Media Types" registry.
   These media types are used to indicate that the content is a CBOR
   voucher either signed with a cms structure or a COSE_Sign1 structure
   [RFC8152].
