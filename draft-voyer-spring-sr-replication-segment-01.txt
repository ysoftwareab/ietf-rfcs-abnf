1.  Introduction

   We define a new type of segment for Segment Routing [RFC8402], called
   Replication segment, which allows a node (henceforth called as
   Replication node) to replicate packets to a set of other nodes
   (called Downstream nodes) in a Segment Routing Domain.  Replication
   segments provide building blocks for Point-to-Multi-point Service
   delivery.  A Replication segment at ingress node of Multi-point
   service could replicates packets directly to each egress node of the
   service (without need for any state on the internal routers), or it
   could be stitched to other Replication segments to build a tree in SR
   domain for Multi-point service.  The latter is outside the scope of
   this document but specified in [I-D.voyer-pim-sr-p2mp-policy].

2.  Replication segment

   In a Segment Routing Domain, a Replication segment is a logical
   segment which connects a Replication node to a set of Downstream
   nodes.  A Replication segment can be either provisioned locally on a

   node or programmed by a PCE.  Replication segments apply equally to
   both SR-MPLS and SRv6 instantiations of Segment Routing.

   A Replication segment is identified by the tuple <Replication-ID,
   Node-ID>, where:

   o  Replication-ID: An identifier for a Replication segment that is
      unique in context of the Replication node.  This is an unsigned
      32-bit number.

   o  Node-ID: The address of a node at which a Replication segment is
      instantiated.  Replication segment is instantiated at Downstream
      nodes and at the replication nodes.  Note that the root of a
      Multi-point service is also a replication node.

   The Replicaion-ID can be extended or modified as required based on
   specific use of a Replication segment.

   A Replication segment is defined by following elements:

   o  Replication SID: The Segment Identifier of a Replication Segment.
      This is a SR-MPLS label or a SRv6 SID [RFC8402].

   o  Downstream Nodes: Set of nodes in Segment Routing domain to which
      a packet is replicated by the Replication segment.

   o  Replication State: See below.

   Replication state is a list of Replication branches to the Downstream
   nodes.  In this document, each branch is abstracted to a <Downstream
   Node, Downstream Replication-SID> tuple.  A Replication branch to a
   particular Downstream Node could be represented by the node's Node
   SID (i.e. it does not matter how traffic gets to the Downstream node,
   whether it's directly connected or not), or in case of a directly
   connected node it could be represented by the Adjacency SID (for the
   interface connecting to the directly connected Leaf Node).
   Alternatively, the Downstream Node could also be expanded to a SID-
   list that partially/fully specifies the explicit path to it.  A
   Replication branch can also use a Segment Routing Policy
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy], if available, from the
   Replication node to the Downstream node.

   Replication SID identifies the Replication Segment in the forwarding
   plane.  The Replication SID SHOULD be considered to be the equivalent
   of Binding SID [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] of a Segment
   Routing Policy, when Replication Segment is instantiated at Ingress
   node of a Multi-point service.  At Downstream nodes, the Replication
   SID MAY be used to identify the Multi-point service.

   A packet steered into a Replication Segment at a node is replicated
   to each Downstream node with the Downstream Replication SID that is
   relevant at that node.  A packet is steered into a Replication
   Segment in two ways:

   o  When the Active Segment [RFC8402] is the Replication SID.  In this
      case, the operation for a replicated copy is CONTINUE.

   o  On the root of a Multi-point service, based on local policy-based
      routing.  In this case, the operation for a replicated copy is
      PUSH.

   Replication segments are instantiated for both a replication node
   itself and the downstream nodes of the Replication segment.  If a
   downstream node is an egress (aka leaf) of the Multi-point service,
   i.e. no further replication is needed, then that leaf node's
   replication segment will not have any replication state and the
   operation is NEXT.  Notice that the segment on the leaf node is still
   referred to as a Replication segment for the purpose of
   generalization.

3.  Use Cases

   In the simplest use case, a replication segment is instantiated on
   the root node of a Multi-point service, with all the downstream nodes
   being the egress/leaf nodes of the the service.  This achieves
   Ingress Replication [RFC7988] that has been widely used for MVPN
   [RFC6513] and EVPN [RFC7432] BUM (Broadcast, Unknown and Multicast)
   traffic.

   Replication segments can also be used as building blocks for
   replication trees when replication segments on the root, intermediate
   replication nodes and leaf nodes are stitched together to achieve
   efficient replciation.  That is outside the scope of this document
   but specified in [I-D.voyer-pim-sr-p2mp-policy].

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security risks introduced by this design.
