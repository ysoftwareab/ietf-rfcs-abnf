Abstract

   Traffic traversing an SR domain is encapsulated in an outer IPv6
   header for its journey through the SR domain.

   To implement transport services strictly within the SR domain, the SR
   domain may require insertion or deletion of an SRH after the outer
   IPv6 header of the SR domain.  Any segment within the SRH is strictly
   contained within the SR domain.

   This document extends SRv6 Network Programming [RFC8986] with new SR
   endpoint and transit behaviors to be performed only within the SR
   domain in any packet owned by the domain.

1.  Introduction

   Packets transiting an SR Domain may be steered into an SR Policy for
   a variety of reasons.  For example, a PLR router reroutes traffic on
   a TI-LFA repair path [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-segment-routing-ti-lfa] or when
   a Binding-SID is expanded [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].

Internet-Draft      SRv6 NET-PGM extension: Insertion      February 2022


   This document extends the SRv6 Network Programming [RFC8986] model
   with new endpoint and transit behaviors enabling the insertion of an
   SRH after the outer IPv6 header of the SR domain.  The operations
   described in this document must take into account the considerations
   described in [I-D.voyer-6man-extension-header-insertion].

2.  SRv6 endpoint behaviors

   SRv6 Network Programming Section 4 defines a base set of SRv6
   endpoint behaviors.  This is extended with the behaviors described in
   this section.

2.1.  End.B6.Insert: Endpoint bound to an SRv6 policy

   The "Endpoint bound to an SRv6 Policy" is a variant of the End
   behavior.

   One of its applications is to express scalable traffic-engineering
   policies across multiple domains.  It is the one of the SRv6
   instantiations of a Binding SID [RFC8402].

   An End.B6.Insert SID is never the last segment in a SID list, and any
   SID instantiation must be associated with an SR Policy
   B[I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].

   When N receives a packet whose IPv6 DA is S and S is a local
   End.B6.Insert SID, does:

  S01. When an SRH is processed {
  S02.   If (Segments Left == 0) {
  S03.      Send an ICMP Parameter Problem message to the Source Address
               Code TBD-SRH (SR Upper-layer Header Error),
               Pointer set to the offset of the upper-layer header,
               interrupt packet processing and discard the packet
  S04.   }
  S04.   If (IPv6 Hop Limit <= 1) {
  S05.       Send an ICMP Time Exceeded message to the Source Address,
               Code 0 (Hop limit exceeded in transit),
               interrupt packet processing and discard the packet
  S06.   }
  S07.   max_LE = (Hdr Ext Len / 2) - 1
  S08.   If ((Last Entry > max_LE) or (Segments Left > (Last Entry+1)){
  S09.      Send an ICMP Parameter Problem to the Source Address,
               Code 0 (Erroneous header field encountered),
               Pointer set to the Segments Left field,
               interrupt packet processing and discard the packet
  S11.   }
  S12.   Decrement Hop Limit by 1
  S13.   Insert a new SRH in between the IPv6 Header and the received
          SRH containing the list of segments of B
  S14.   Set the IPv6 DA to the first segment of B
  S15.   Resubmit the packet to the egress IPv6 FIB lookup and
            transmission to the new destination
  S16. }

   When processing the Upper-layer header of a packet matching a FIB
   entry locally instantiated as an SRv6 End.B6.Insert SID, send an ICMP
   parameter problem message to the Source Address and discard the
   packet.  Error code "SR Upper-layer Header Error", Pointer set to the
   offset of the upper-layer header.

2.2.  End.B6.Insert.Red: [...] with reduced SRH

   This is an optimization of the End.B6.Insert behavior.

   End.B6.Insert.Red reduces the size of the new SRH by one SID by
   avoiding the insertion of the first SID in the pushed SRH.  In this
   way, the first SID is only written in the DA and the packet is
   forwarded according to it.

   The new SRH is created as described in Section 4.1.1 of [RFC8754].

3.  SR Policy Headend Behaviors

   SRv6 Network Programming defines in Section 5 a set of SR Policy
   Headend Behaviors.  This is extended with the following behaviors
   defined in this section.

3.1.  H.Insert: SR Headend with insertion of an SRv6 Policy

   Node N receives two packets P1=(A, B2) and P2=(A,B2)(B3, B2, B1;
   SL=1).  B2 is neither a local address nor SID of N.

   N steers the transit packets P1 and P2 into an SRv6 Policy with one
   SID list <S1, S2, S3>.

   The "H.Insert" transit insertion behavior is defined as follows:

 1.   insert the SRH (B2, S3, S2, S1; SL=3)             ;; Ref1, Ref1bis
 2.   set the IPv6 DA = S1
 3.   forward along the shortest path to S1

   Ref1: The received IPv6 DA is placed as last SID of the inserted SRH.

   Ref1bis: The SRH is inserted
   [I-D.voyer-6man-extension-header-insertion] before any other IPv6
   Routing Extension Header.

   After the H.Insert behavior, P1 and P2 respectively look like:

   1.  (A, S1) (B2, S3, S2, S1; SL=3)

   2.  (A, S1) (B2, S3, S2, S1; SL=3) (B3, B2, B1; SL=1)

3.2.  H.Insert.Red: H.Insert with reduced insertion

   The H.Insert.Red behavior is an optimization of the H.Insert
   behavior.  It is defined as follows:

   1.   insert the SRH (B2, S3, S2; SL=3)
   2.   set the IPv6 DA = S1
   3.   forward along the shortest path to S1

   H.Insert.Red will reduce the size of the SRH by one segment by
   avoiding the insertion of the first SID in the pushed SRH.  In this
   way, the first segment is only introduced in the DA and the packet is
   forwarded according to it.

   After the H.Insert.Red behavior, P1 and P2 respectively look like:

Internet-Draft      SRv6 NET-PGM extension: Insertion      February 2022


   1.  (A, S1) (B2, S3, S2; SL=3)

   2.  (A, S1) (B2, S3, S2; SL=3) (B3, B2, B1; SL=1)

4.  Maximum H.Insert MSD Type

   This document defines the MSD (Maximum SID Depth) for H.Insert
   behavior and requests the MSD type assignment from the IGP MSD-Types
   registry created by [RFC8491].

   The Maximum H.Insert MSD Type specifies the maximum number of SIDs
   that can be inserted as part of the "H.insert" behavior:

   1.  Max H.insert Type: 43 (Suggested value - to be assigned by IANA)

   If the advertised value is zero or no value is advertised then the
   router is assumed not to support any variation of the "H.insert"
   behavior.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  SRv6 Endpoint Behaviors

   This document requests IANA to allocate the following codepoints
   within the "SRv6 Endpoint Behaviors" sub-registry under the top-level
   "Segment Routing Parameters" registry.

            +=======+========+===================+===========+
            | Value |  Hex   | Endpoint behavior | Reference |
            +=======+========+===================+===========+

            +-------+--------+-------------------+-----------+
            | 26    | 0x001A | End.B6.Insert.Red | [This.ID] |
            +-------+--------+-------------------+-----------+

5.2.  MSD Types

   This document requests IANA to allocate the following codepoint
   within the "IGP MSD-Types" sub-registry under the top-level "IGP
   Parameters" registry.
