            Advanced Unidirectional Route Assessment (AURA)
                        draft-ietf-ippm-route-02

Abstract

   This memo introduces an advanced unidirectional route assessment
   (AURA) metric and associated measurement methodology, based on the IP
   Performance Metrics (IPPM) Framework RFC 2330.  This memo updates RFC
   2330 in the areas of path-related terminology and path description,
   primarily to include the possibility of parallel subpaths between a
   given Source and Destination pair, owing to the presence of multi-
   path technologies.

1.  Introduction

   The IETF IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) working group first created a
   framework for metric development in [RFC2330].  This framework has
   stood the test of time and enabled development of many fundamental
   metrics.  It has been updated in the area of metric composition
   [RFC5835], and in several areas related to active stream measurement
   of modern networks with reactive properties [RFC7312].

   The [RFC2330] framework motivated the development of "performance and
   reliability metrics for paths through the Internet," and Section 5 of
   [RFC2330] defines terms that support description of a path under
   test.  However, metrics for assessment of path components and related
   performance aspects had not been attempted in IPPM when the [RFC2330]
   framework was written.

   This memo takes-up the route measurement challenge and specifies a
   new route metric, two practical frameworks for methods of measurement
   (using either active or hybrid active-passive methods [RFC7799]), and
   round-trip delay and link information discovery using the results of
   measurements.  All route measurements are limited by the willingness
   of hosts along the path to be discovered, to cooperate with the
   methods used, or to recognize that the measurement operation is
   taking place (such as when tunnels are present).

1.1.  Issues with Earlier Work to define Route

   Section 7 of [RFC2330] presented a simple example of a "route" metric
   along with several other examples.  The example is reproduced below
   (where the reference is to Section 5 of [RFC2330]):

   "route: The path, as defined in Section 5, from A to B at a given
   time."

   This example provides a starting point to develop a more complete
   definition of route.  Areas needing clarification include:

   Time:  In practice, the route will be assessed over a time interval,
      because active path detection methods like [PT] rely on TTL limits
      for their operation and cannot accomplish discovery of all hosts
      using a single packet.

   Type-P:  The legacy route definition lacks the option to cater for
      packet-dependent routing.  In this memo, we assess the route for a
      specific packet of Type-P, and reflect this in the metric
      definition.  The methods of measurement determine the specific
      Type-P used.

Internet-Draft           AURA Metrics & Methods                July 2018


   Parallel Paths:  This a reality of Internet paths and a strength of
      advanced route assessment methods, so the metric must acknowledge
      this possibility.  Use of Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) and Unequal
      Cost Multi-Path (UCMP) technologies are common sources of parallel
      subpaths.

   Cloud Subpath:  May contain hosts that do not decrement TTL or Hop
      Limit, but may have two or more exchange links connecting
      "discoverable" hosts or routers.  Parallel subpaths contained
      within clouds cannot be discovered.  The assessment methods only
      discover hosts or routers on the path that decrement TTL or Hop
      Count, or cooperate with interrogation protocols.  The presence of
      tunnels and nested tunnels further complicate assessment by hiding
      hops.

   Hop:  Although the [RFC2330] definition was a link-host pair, only
      hosts are discoverable or have the capability to cooperate with
      interrogation protocols where link information may be exposed.

   The refined definition of Route metrics begins in the sections that
   follow.

2.  Scope

   The purpose of this memo is to add new route metrics and methods of
   measurement to the existing set of IPPM metrics.

   The scope is to define route metrics that can identify the path taken
   by a packet or a flow traversing the Internet between two hosts.
   Although primarily intended for hosts communicating on the Internet
   with IP, the definitions and metrics are constructed to be applicable
   to other network domains, if desired.  The methods of measurement to
   assess the path may not be able to discover all hosts comprising the
   path, but such omissions are often deterministic and explainable
   sources of error.

   Also, to specify a framework for active methods of measurement which
   use the techniques described in [PT] at a minimum, and a framework
   for hybrid active-passive methods of measurement, such as the Hybrid
   Type I method [RFC7799] described in
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data](intended only for single administrative
   domains), which do not rely on ICMP and provide a protocol for
   explicit interrogation of nodes on a path.  Combinations of active
   methods and hybrid active-passive methods are also in-scope.

   Further, this memo provides additional analysis of the round-trip
   delay measurements made possible by the methods, in an effort to




Alvarez-Hamelin, et al.  Expires January 3, 2019                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft           AURA Metrics & Methods                July 2018


   discover more details about the path, such as the link technology in
   use.

   This memo updates Section 5 of [RFC2330] in the areas of path-related
   terminology and path description, primarily to include the
   possibility of parallel subpaths between a given Source and
   Destination address pair (possibly resulting from Equal Cost Multi-
   Path (ECMP) and Unequal Cost Multi-Path (UCMP) technologies).

   There are several simple non-goals of this memo.  There is no attempt
   to assess the reverse path from any host on the path to the host
   attempting the path measurement.  The reverse path contribution to
   delay will be that experienced by ICMP packets (in active methods),
   and may be different from delays experienced by UDP or TCP packets.
   Also, the round trip delay will include an unknown contribution of
   processing time at the host that generates the ICMP response.
   Therefore, the ICMP-based active methods are not supposed to yield
   accurate, reproducible estimations of the round-trip delay that UDP
   or TCP packets will experience.

3.  Route Metric Terms and Definitions

   This section sets requirements for the following components to
   support the Route Metric:

   Host Identity  The unique address for hosts communicating within the
      network domain.  For hosts communicating on the Internet with IP,
      it is the globally routable IP address(es) which the host uses
      when communicating with other hosts under normal or error
      conditions.  The Host Identity revealed (and its connection to a
      Host Name through reverse DNS) determines whether interfaces to
      parallel links can be associated with a single host, or appear to
      identify unique hosts.

   Discoverable Host  Hosts that convey their Host Identity according to
      the requirements of their network domain, such as when error
      conditions are detected by that host.  For hosts communicating
      with IP packets, compliance with Section 3.2.2.4 of [RFC1122] when
      discarding a packet due to TTL or Hop Limit Exceeded condition,
      MUST result in sending the corresponding Time Exceeded message
      (containing a form of host identity) to the source.  This
      requirement is also consistent with section 5.3.1 of [RFC1812] for
      routers.

   Cooperating Host  Hosts MUST respond to direct queries for their host
      identity as part of a previously agreed and established
      interrogation protocol.  Hosts SHOULD also provide information
      such as arrival/departure interface identification, arrival

      timestamp, and any relevant information about the host or specific
      link which delivered the query to the host.

   Hop  A Hop MUST contain a Host Identity, and MAY contain arrival and/
      or departure interface identification.

3.1.  Formal Name

   Type-P-Route-Ensemble-Method-Variant, abbreviated as Route Ensemble.

   Note that Type-P depends heavily on the chosen method and variant.

3.2.  Parameters

   This section lists the REQUIRED input factors to specify a Route
   metric.

   o  Src, the address of a host (such as the globally routable IP
      address).

   o  Dst, the address of a host (such as the globally routable IP
      address).

   o  i, the limit on the number of Hops a specific packet may visit as
      it traverses from the host at Src to the host at Dst (such as the
      TTL or Hop Limit).

   o  MaxHops, the maximum value of i used, (i=1,2,3,...MaxHops).

   o  T0, a time (start of measurement interval)

   o  Tf, a time (end of measurement interval)

   o  T, the host time of a packet as measured at MP(Src), meaning
      Measurement Point at the Source.

   o  Ta, the host time of a reply packet's *arrival* as measured at
      MP(Src), assigned to packets that arrive within a "reasonable"
      time (see parameter below).

   o  Tmax, a maximum waiting time for reply packets to return to the
      source, set sufficiently long to disambiguate packets with long
      delays from packets that are discarded (lost), such that the
      distribution of round-trip delay is not truncated.

   o  F, the number of different flows simulated by the method and
      variant.

Internet-Draft           AURA Metrics & Methods                July 2018


   o  flow, the stream of packets with the same n-tuple of designated
      header fields that (when held constant) result in identical
      treatment in a multi-path decision (such as the decision taken in
      load balancing).

   o  Type-P, the complete description of the packets for which this
      assessment applies (including the flow-defining fields).

3.3.  Metric Definitions

   This section defines the REQUIRED measurement components of the Route
   metrics (unless otherwise indicated):

   M, the total number of packets sent between T0 and Tf.

   N, the smallest value of i needed for a packet to be received at Dst
   (sent between T0 and Tf).

   Nmax, the largest value of i needed for a packet to be received at
   Dst (sent between T0 and Tf).  Nmax may be equal to N.

   Next, define a *singleton* definition for a Hop on the path, with
   sufficient indexes to identify all Hops identified in a measurement
   interval.

   A Hop, designated h(i,j), the IP address and/or identity of one of j
   Discoverable Hosts (or Cooperating Hosts) that are i hops away from
   the host with address = Src during the measurement interval, T0 to
   Tf.  As defined above, a Hop singleton measurement MUST contain a
   Host Identity, hid(i,j), and MAY contain one or more of the following
   attributes:

   o  a(i,j) Arrival Interface ID

   o  d(i,j) Departure Interface ID

   o  t(i,j) Arrival Timestamp (where t(i,j) is ideally supplied by the
      hop, or approximated from the sending time of the packet that
      revealed the hop)

   o  Measurements of Round Trip Delay (for each packet that reveals the
      same Host Identity and attributes, but not timestamp of course,
      see next section)

   Now that Host Identities and related information can be positioned
   according to their distance from the host with address Src in hops,
   we introduce two forms of Routes:

Internet-Draft           AURA Metrics & Methods                July 2018


   A Route Ensemble is defined as the combination of all routes
   traversed by different flows from the host at Src address to the host
   at Dst address.  The route traversed by each flow (with addresses Src
   and Dst, and other fields which constitute flow criteria) is a member
   of the ensemble and called a Member Route.

   Using h(i,j) and components and parameters, further define:

   A Member Route is an ordered graph {h(1,j), ... h(Nj, j)} in the
   context of a single flow, where h(i-1, j) and h(i, j) are by 1 hop
   away from each other and Nj=Dst is the minimum count of hops needed
   by the packet on Member Route j to reach Dst. Member Routes must be
   unique.  The uniqueness property requires that any two Member routes
   j and k that are part of the same Route Ensemble differ either in
   terms of minimum hop count Nj and Nk to reach the destination Dst,
   or, in the case of identical hop count Nj=Nk, they have at least one
   distinct hop: h(i,j) != h(i, k) for at least one i (i=1..Nj).

   The Route Ensemble from Src to Dst, during the measurement interval
   T0 to Tf, is the aggregate of all m distinct Member Routes discovered
   between the two hosts with Src and Dst addresses.  More formally,
   with the host having address Src omitted:

   Route Ensemble = {
   {h(1,1), h(2,1), h(3,1), ... h(N1,1)=Dst},
   {h(1,2), h(2,2), h(3,2),..., h(N2,2)=Dst},
   ...
   {h(1,m), h(2,m), h(3,m), ....h(Nm,m)=Dst}
   }


   where the following conditions apply: i <= Nj <= Nmax (j=1..m)

   Note that some h(i,j) may be empty (null) in the case that systems do
   not reply (not discoverable, or not cooperating).

   h(i-1,j) and h(i,j) are the Hops on the same Member Route one hop
   away from each other.

   Hop h(i,j) may be identical with h(k,l) for i!=k and j!=l ; which
   means there may be portions shared among different Member Routes
   (parts of various routes may overlap).

3.4.  Related Round-Trip Delay and Loss Definitions

   RTD(i,j,T) is defined as a singleton of the [RFC2681] Round-trip
   Delay between the host with address = Src and the host at Hop h(i,j)
   at time T.



Alvarez-Hamelin, et al.  Expires January 3, 2019                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft           AURA Metrics & Methods                July 2018


   RTL(i,j,T) is defined as a singleton of the [RFC6673] Round-trip Loss
   between the host with address = Src and the host at Hop h(i,j) at
   time T.

3.5.  Discussion

   Depending on the way that Host Identity is revealed, it may be
   difficult to determine parallel subpaths between the same pair of
   hosts (i.e. multiple parallel links).  It is easier to detect
   parallel subpaths involving different hosts.

   o  If a pair of discovered hosts identify two different addresses,
      then they will appear to be different hosts.

   o  If a pair of discovered hosts identify two different IP addresses,
      and the IP addresses resolve to the same host name (in the DNS),
      then they will appear to be the same hosts.

   o  If a discovered host always replies using the same network
      address, regardless of the interface a packet arrives on, then
      multiple parallel links cannot be detected in that network domain.

   o  If parallel links between routers are aggregated below the IP
      layer, In other words, all links share the same pair of IP
      addresses, then the existence of these parallel links can't be
      detected at IP layer.  This applies to other network domains with
      layers below them, as well.

   @@@@ This paragraph on Temporal Composition moved to support a more
   complete section on Methodology (section 4).

   When a route assessment employs IP packets (for example), the reality
   of flow assignment to parallel subpaths involves layers above IP.
   Thus, the measured Route Ensemble is applicable to IP and higher
   layers (as described in the methodology's packet of Type-P and flow
   parameters).

   @@@@ The Temporal Measurement and Route Class C (unrelated to address
   classes of the past) is now partly addressed in Section 4.

3.6.  Reporting the Metric

   @@@@ now partly addressed, based on feedback at IETF-101:

   An Information Model and an XML Data Model for Storing Traceroute
   Measurements is available in [RFC5388].  The measured information at
   each hop includes four pieces of information: a one-dimensional hop




Alvarez-Hamelin, et al.  Expires January 3, 2019                [Page 9]

   index, host symbolic address, host IP address, and RTD for each
   response.

   The description of Hop information that may be collected according to
   this memo covers more dimensions, as defined in Section 3.3 above.
   For example, the Hop index is two-dimensional to capture the
   complexity of a Route Ensemble, and it contains corresponding host
   identities at a minimum.  The models need to be expanded to include
   these features, as well as Arrival Interface ID, Departure Interface
   ID, and Arrival Timestamp, when available.

   @@@@ can we leave updates to RFC 5388 for further work?  Or, do we
   need to take-on this topic in an Appendix here?

4.  Route Assessment Methodologies

   There are two classes of methods described in this section, active
   methods relying on the reaction to TTL or Hop Limit Exceeded
   condition to discover hosts on a path, and Hybrid active-passive
   methods that involve direct interrogation of cooperating hosts
   (usually within a single domain).  Description of these methods
   follow.

   @@@@ Editor's Note: We need to incorporate description of Type-P
   packets (with the flow parameters) used in each method below (done
   for Active).

4.1.  Active Methodologies

   We have chosen to describe the method based on that employed in
   current open source tools, thereby providing a practical framework
   for further advanced techniques to be included as method variants.
   This method is applicable to use across multiple administrative
   domains.

   Paris-traceroute [PT] provides some measure of protection from path
   variation generated by ECMP load balancing, and it ensures traceroute
   packets will follow the same path in 98% of cases according to
   [SCAMPER].  If it is necessary to find every path possible between
   two hosts, Paris-traceroute provides "exhaustive" mode while scamper
   provides "tracelb" (stands for traceroute load balance).

   The Type-P of packets used could be ICMP (as in the original
   traceroute), UDP or TCP.  The later are used when a particular
   characteristic needs to be to verified, such as filtering or traffic
   shaping on specific ports (i.e., services).  [SCAMPER] supports IPv6
   traceroute measurements, keeping the FlowLable constant in all
   packets.

Internet-Draft           AURA Metrics & Methods                July 2018


   The advanced route assessment methods used in Paris-traceroute [PT]
   keep the critical fields constant for every packet to maintain the
   appearance of the same flow.  Since route assessment can be conducted
   using TCP, UDP or ICMP packets, this method REQUIRES the Diffserv
   field, the protocol number, IP source and destination addresses, and
   the port settings for TCP or UDP kept constant.  For ICMP probes, the
   method additionally REQUIRES keeping the type, code, and ICMP
   checksum constant; which occupy the corresponding positions in the
   header of an IP packet, e.g., bytes 20 to 23 when the header IP has
   no options.

   Maintaining a constant checksum in ICMP is most challenging because
   the ICMP Sequence Number is part of the calculation.  The advanced
   traceroute method requires calculations using the IP Sequence Number
   Field and the Identifier Field, yielding a constant ICMP checksum in
   successive packets.  For an example of calculations to maintain a
   constant checksum, see Appendix A of [RFC7820], where revision of a
   timestamp field is complemented by modifying the 2 octet checksum
   complement field (these fields take the roles of the ICMP Sequence
   Number and Identifier Fields, respectively).

   For TCP and UDP packets, the checksum must also be kept constant.
   Therefore, the first four bytes of UDP (or TCP) data field are
   modified to compensate for fields that change from packet to packet.

   @@@@ Note: other variants of advanced traceroute are planned be
   described.

   Finally, the return path is also important to check.  Taking into
   account that it is an ICMP time exceeded (during transit) packet, the
   source and destination IP are constant for every reply.  Then, we
   should consider the fields in the first 32 bits of the protocol on
   the top of IP: the type and code of ICMP packet, and its checksum.
   Again, to maintain the ICMP checksum constant for the returning
   packets, we need to consider the whole ICMP message.  It contains the
   IP header of the discarded packet plus the first 8 bytes of the IP
   payload; that is some of the fields of TCP header, the UDP header
   plus four data bytes, the ICMP header plus four bytes.  Therefore,
   for UDP case the data field is used to maintain the ICMP checksum
   constant in the returning packet.  For the ICMP case, the identifier
   and sequence fields of the sent ICMP probe are manipulated to be
   constant.  The TCP case presents no problem because its first eight
   bytes will be the same for every packet probe.

   Formally, to maintain the same flow in the measurements to a certain
   hop, the Type-P-Route-Ensemble-Method-Variant packets should be[PT]:

   o  TCP case: Fields Src, Dst, port-Src, port_Dst, and Diffserv Field
      should be the same.

   o  UDP case: Fields Src, Dst, port-Src, port-Dst, and Diffserv Field
      should be the same, the UDP-checksum should change to maintain
      constant the IP checksum of the ICMP time exceeded reply.  Then,
      the data length should be fixed, and the data field is used to
      fixing it (consider that ICMP checksum uses its data field, which
      contains the original IP header plus 8 bytes of UDP, where TTL, IP
      identification, IP checksum, and UDP checksum changes).

   o  ICMP case: The Data field should compensate variations on TTL, IP
      identification, and IP checksum for every packet.

   Then, the way to identify different hops and attempts of the same
   flow is:

   o  TCP case: The IP identification field.

   o  UDP case: The IP identification field.

   o  ICMP case: The IP identification field, and ICMP Sequence number.

4.1.1.  Temporal Composition for Route Metrics

   The Active Route Assessment Methods described above have the ability
   to discover portions of a path where ECMP load balancing is present,
   observed as two or more unique Member Routes having one or more
   distinct Hops which are part of the Route Ensemble.  Likewise,
   attempts to deliberately vary the flow characteristics to discover
   all Member Routes will reveal portions of the path which are flow-
   invariant.

   Section 9.2 of [RFC2330] describes Temporal Composition of metrics,
   and introduces the possibility of a relationship between earlier
   measurement results and the results for measurement at the current
   time (for a given metric).  There is value in establishing a Temporal
   Composition relationship for Route Metrics.  However, this
   relationship does not represent a forecast of future route conditions
   in any way.

   For Route Metric measurements, the value of Temporal Composition is
   to reduce the measurement iterations required with repeated
   measurements.  Reduced iterations are possible by inferring that
   current measurements using fixed and previously measured flow
   characteristics:

   o  will have many common hops with previous measurements.



Alvarez-Hamelin, et al.  Expires January 3, 2019               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft           AURA Metrics & Methods                July 2018


   o  will have relatively time-stable results at the ingress and egress
      portions of the path when measured from user locations, as opposed
      to measurements of backbone networks and across inter-domain
      gateways.

   o  may have greater potential for time-variation in path portions
      where ECMP load balancing is observed (because increasing or
      decreasing the pool of links changes the hash calculations).

   Optionally, measurement systems may take advantage of the inferences
   above when seeking to reduce measurement iterations, after exhaustive
   measurements indicate that the time-stable properties are present.
   Repetitive Active Route measurement systems:

   1.  SHOULD occasionally check path portions which have exhibited
       stable results over time, particularly ingress and egress
       portions of the path.

   2.  SHOULD continue testing portions of the path that have previously
       exhibited ECMP load balancing.

   3.  SHALL trigger re-assessment of the complete path and Route
       Ensemble, if any change in hops is observed for a specific (and
       previously tested) flow.

   @@@@ Comments on this new material are very welcome!

4.1.2.  Routing Class C Identification

   There is an opportunity to apply the [RFC2330] notion of equal
   treatment for a class of packets, "...very useful to know if a given
   Internet component treats equally a class C of different types of
   packets", as it applies to Route measurements.  Knowledge of "class
   C" parameters (unrelated to address classes of the past) on a path
   potentially reduces the number of flows required for a given method
   to assess a Route Ensemble over time.

   First, recognize that each Member Route of a Route Ensemble will have
   a corresponding Routing Class C.  Class C can be discovered by
   testing with multiple flows, all of which traverse the unique set of
   hops that comprise a specific Member Route.

   Second, recognize that the different Routing Classes depend primarily
   on the hash functions used at each instance of ECMP load balancing on
   the path.

   Third, recognize the synergy with Temporal Composition methods
   (described above) where evaluation intends to discover time-stable



Alvarez-Hamelin, et al.  Expires January 3, 2019               [Page 13]

   portions of each Member Route so that more emphasis can be placed on
   ECMP portions that also determine Class C.

   The methods to assess the various Routing Class C characteristics
   benefit from the following measurement capabilities:

   o  flows designed to determine which n-tuple header fields are
      considered by a given hash function and ECMP hop on the path, and
      which are not.  This operation immediately narrows the search
      space, where possible, and partially defines a Routing Class C.

   o  a priori knowledge of the possible types of hash functions in use
      also helps to design the flows for testing (major router vendors
      publish information about these hash functions, examples are here
      https://www.researchgate.net/
      publication/281571413_COMPARISON_OF_HASH_STRATEGIES_FOR_FLOW-
      BASED_LOAD_BALANCING ).

   o  ability to direct the emphasis of current measurements on ECMP
      portions of the path, based on recent past measurement results
      (the Class C of some portions of the path is essentially "all
      packets").

   @@@@ Comments on this new material are very welcome!  Especially
   suggestions for tools that might lend themselves to support these
   measurements.

4.2.  Hybrid Methodologies

   The Hybrid Type I methods provide an alternative method for Route
   Member assessment.  As mentioned in the Scope section,
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] provides a possible set of data fields that
   would support route identification.

   In general, nodes in the measured domain would be equipped with
   specific abilities:

   1.  The ingress node adds one or more fields to the measurement
       packets, and identifies to other nodes in the domain that a route
       assessment will be conducted using one or more specific packets.
       The packets typically originate from a host outside the domain,
       and constitute normal traffic on the domain.

   2.  Each node visited by the specific packet within in the domain
       identifies itself in a data field of the packet (the field has
       been added for this purpose).





Alvarez-Hamelin, et al.  Expires January 3, 2019               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft           AURA Metrics & Methods                July 2018


   3.  When a measurement packet reaches the edge node of the domain,
       the edge node adds its identity to the list, removes all the
       identities from the packet, forwards the packet onward, and
       communicates the ordered list of node identities to the intended
       receiver.

   In addition to node identity, nodes may also identify the ingress and
   egress interfaces utilized by the tracing packet, the time of day
   when the packet was processed, and other generic data (as described
   in section 4 of [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data]).

4.3.  Combining Different Methods

   In principle, there are advantages if the entity conducting Route
   measurements can utilize both forms of advanced methods (active and
   hybrid), and combine the results.  For example, if there are hosts
   involved in the path that qualify as Cooperating Hosts, but not as
   Discoverable Hosts, then a more complete view of hops on the path is
   possible when a hybrid method (or interrogation protocol) is applied
   and the results are combined with the active method results collected
   across all other domains.

   In order to combine the results of active and hybrid/interrogation
   methods, the network hosts that are part of a domain supporting an
   interrogation protocol have the following attributes:

   1.  Hosts at the ingress to the domain SHOULD be both Discoverable
       and Cooperating, and SHOULD reveal the same Host Identity in
       response to both active and hybrid methods.

   2.  Any Hosts within the domain that are both Discoverable and
       Cooperating SHOULD reveal the same Host Identity in response to
       both active and hybrid methods.

   3.  Hosts at the egress to the domain SHOULD be both Discoverable and
       Cooperating, and SHOULD reveal the same Host Identity in response
       to both active and hybrid methods.

   When Hosts follow these requirements, it becomes a simple matter to
   match single domain measurements with the overlapping results from a
   multidomain measurement.

   In practice, Internet users do not typically have the ability to
   utilize the OAM capabilities of networks that their packets traverse,
   so the results from a remote domain supporting an interrogation
   protocol would not normally be accessible.  However, a network
   operator could combine interrogation results from their access domain
   with other measurements revealing the path outside their domain.

5.  Background on Round-Trip Delay Measurement Goals

   The aim of this method is to use packet probes to unveil the paths
   between any two end-hosts of the network.  Moreover, information
   derived from RTD measurements might be meaningful to identify:

   1.  Intercontinental submarine links

   2.  Satellite communications

   3.  Congestion

   4.  Inter-domain paths

   This categorization is widely accepted in the literature and among
   operators alike, and it can be trusted with empirical data and
   several sources as ground of truth (e.g., [RTTSub] [bdrmap][IDCong]).

   The first two categories correspond to the physical distance
   dependency on Round Trip Delay (RTD) while the last one binds RTD
   with queueing delay on routers.  Due to the significant contribution
   of propagation delay in long distance hops, RTD will be at least
   100ms on transatlantic hops, depending on the geolocation of the
   vantage points.  Moreover, RTD is typically greater than 480ms when
   two hops are connected using geostationary satellite technology
   (i.e., their orbit is at 36000km).  Detecting congestion with latency
   implies deeper mathematical understanding since network traffic load
   is not stationary.  Nonetheless, as the first approach, a link seems
   to be congested if after sending several traceroute probes, it is
   possible to detect congestion observing different statistics
   parameters (e.g., see [IDCong]).

6.  Tools to Measure Delays in the Internet

   Internet routing is complex because it depends on the policies of
   thousands Autonomous Systems (AS).  While most of the routers perform
   load balancing on flows using Equal Cost Multiple Path (ECMP), a few
   still divide the workload through packet-based techniques.  The
   former scenario is defined according to [RFC2991] while the latter
   generates a round-robin scheme to deliver every new outgoing packet.
   ECMP keeps flow state in the router to ensure every packet of a flow
   is delivered by the same path, and this avoids increasing the packet
   delay variation and possibly producing overwhelming packet reordering
   in TCP flows.

   Taking into account that Internet protocol was designed under the
   "end-to-end" principle, the IP payload and its header do not provide
   any information about the routes or path necessary to reach some



Alvarez-Hamelin, et al.  Expires January 3, 2019               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft           AURA Metrics & Methods                July 2018


   destination.  For this reason, the well-known tool traceroute was
   developed to gather the IP addresses of each hop along a path using
   the ICMP protocol [RFC0792].  Besides, traceroute adds the measured
   RTD from each hop.  However, the growing complexity of the Internet
   makes it more challenging to develop accurate traceroute
   implementation.  For instance, the early traceroute tools would be
   inaccurate in the current network, mainly because they were not
   designed to retain flow state.  However, evolved traceroute tools,
   such as Paris-traceroute [PT] [MLB] and Scamper [SCAMPER], expect to
   encounter ECMP and achieve more accurate results when they do.

   Paris-traceroute-like tools operate in the following way: every
   packet should follow the same path because the sensitive fields of
   the header are controlled to appear as the same flow.  This means
   that source and destination IP addresses, source and destination port
   numbers are the same in every packet.  Additionally, Differentiated
   Services Code Point (DSCP), checksum and ICMP code should remain
   constant since they may affect the path selection.

   Today's traceroute tools can send either UDP, TCP or ICMP packet
   probes.  Since ICMP header does not include transport layer
   information, there are no fields for source and destination port
   numbers.  For this reason, these tools keep constant ICMP type, code,
   and checksum fields to generate a kind of flow.  However, the
   checksum may vary in every packet, therefore when probes use ICMP
   packets, ICMP Identifier and Sequence Number are manipulated to
   maintain constant checksum in every packet.  On the other hand, when
   UDP probes are generated, the expected variation in the checksum of
   each packet is again compensated by manipulating the payload.

   Paris-traceroute allows its users to measure RTD in every hop of the
   path for a particular flow.  Furthermore, either Paris-traceroute or
   Scamper is capable of unveiling the many available paths between a
   source and destination (which are visible to this method).  This task
   is accomplished by repeating complete traceroute measurements with
   different flow parameters for each measurement.  The Framework for IP
   Performance Metrics (IPPM) ([RFC2330] updated by[RFC7312]) has the
   flexibility to require that the round-trip delay measurement
   [RFC2681] uses packets with the constraints to assure that all
   packets in a single measurement appear as the same flow.  This
   flexibility covers ICMP, UDP, and TCP.  The accompanying methodology
   of [RFC2681] needs to be expanded to report the sequential hop
   identifiers along with RTD measurements, but no new metric definition
   is needed.

7.  RTD Measurements Statistics

   Several articles have shown that network traffic presents a self-
   similar nature [SSNT] [MLRM] which is accountable for filling the
   queues of the routers.  Moreover, router queues are designed to
   handle traffic bursts, which is one of the most remarkable features
   of self-similarity.  Naturally, while queue length increases, the
   delay to traverse the queue increases as well and leads to an
   increase on RTD.  Due to traffic bursts generate short-term overflow
   on buffers (spiky patterns), every RTD only depicts the queueing
   status on the instant when that packet probe was in transit.  For
   this reason, several RTD measurements during a time window could
   begin to describe the random behavior of latency.  Loss must also be
   accounted for in the methodology.

   To understand the ongoing process, examining the quartiles provides a
   non-parametric way of analysis.  Quartiles are defined by five
   values: minimum RTD (m), RTD value of the 25% of the Empirical
   Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF) (Q1), the median value (Q2),
   the RTD value of the 75% of the ECDF (Q3) and the maximum RTD (M).
   Congestion can be inferred when RTD measurements are spread apart,
   and consequently, the Inter-Quartile Range (IQR), the distance
   between Q3 and Q1, increases its value.

   This procedure requires to compute quartile values "on the fly" using
   the algorithm presented in [P2].

   This procedure allow us to update the quartiles value whenever a new
   measurement arrives, which is radically different from classic
   methods of computing quartiles because they need to use the whole
   dataset to compute the values.  This way of calculus provides savings
   in memory and computing time.

   To sum up, the proposed measurement procedure consists in performing
   traceroutes several times to obtain samples of the RTD in every hop
   from a path, during a time window (W) and compute the quantiles for
   every hop.  This could be done for a single path flow or for every
   detected path flow.

   Even though a particular hop may be understood as the amount of hops
   away from the source, a more detailed classification could be used.
   For example, a possible classification may be identify ICMP Time
   Exceeded packets coming from the same routers to those who have the
   same hop distance, IP address of the router which is replying and TTL
   value of the received ICMP packet.

   Thus, the proposed methodology is based on this algorithm:

 ================================================================
  1  input:   W (window time of the measurement)
  2           i_t (time between two measurements)
  3           E (True: exhaustive, False: a single path)
  4           Dst (destination IP address)
  5  output:  Qs (quartiles for every hop and alt in the path(s) to Dst)
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
  6  T <? start_timer(W)
  7  while T is not finished do:
  8  |       start_timer(i_t)
  9  |       RTD(hop,alt) = advanced-traceroute(Dst,E)
 10  |       for each hop and alt in RTD do:
 11  |       |     Qs[Dst,hop,alt] <? ComputeQs(RTD(hop,alt))
 12  |       done
 13  |       wait until i_t timer is expired
 14  done
 15  return (Qs)
 ================================================================

   In line 9 the advance-traceroute could be either Paris-traceroute or
   Scamper, which will use "exhaustive" mode or "tracelb" option if E is
   set True, respectively.  The procedure returns a list of tuples
   (m,Q1,Q2,Q3,M) for each intermediate hop in the path towards the Dst.
   Additionally, it could also return path variations using "alt"
   variable.

8.  Conclusions

   Combining the method proposed in Section 4 and statistics in
   Section 7, we can measure the performance of paths interconnecting
   two endpoints in Internet, and attempt the categorization of link
   types and congestion presence based on RTD.

9.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations that apply to any active measurement of
   live paths are relevant here as well.  See [RFC4656] and [RFC5357].

   The active measurement process of "changing several fields to keep
   the checksum of different packets identical" does not require special
   security considerations because it is part of synthetic traffic
   generation, and is designed to have minimal to zero impact on network
   processing (to process the packets for ECMP).

   @@@@ add reference to security considerations from
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

   When considering privacy of those involved in measurement or those
   whose traffic is measured, the sensitive information available to
   potential observers is greatly reduced when using active techniques
   which are within this scope of work.  Passive observations of user
   traffic for measurement purposes raise many privacy issues.  We refer
   the reader to the privacy considerations described in the Large Scale
   Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP) Framework [RFC7594],
   which covers active and passive techniques.

12.  Appendix I MPLS Methods for Route Assessment

   A host assessing an MPLS path must be part of the MPLS domain where
   the path is implemented.  When this condition is met, RFC 8029
   provides a powerful set of mechanisms to detect "correct operation of
   the data plane, as well as a mechanism to verify the data plane
   against the control plane" [RFC8029].

   MPLS routing is based on the presence of a Forwarding Equivalence
   Class (FEC) Stack in all visited hosts.  Selecting one of several
   Equal Cost Multi Path (ECMP) is however based on information hidden
   deeper in the stack.  Early deployments may support a so called
   "Entropy label" for this purpose.  State of the art deployments base
   their choice of an ECMP member based on the IP addresses.  Both
   methods allow load sharing information to be decoupled from routing
   information.  Thus, an MPLS traceroute is able to check how packets
   with a contiguous number of ECMP relevant addresses (and the same
   destination) are routed by a particular router.  The minimum number
   of MPLS paths traceable at a router should be 32.  Implementations
   supporting more paths are available.

   The MPLS echo request and reply messages offering this feature must
   support the Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV (was Downstream Mapping
   initially, but the latter has been deprecated).  The MPLS echo



Alvarez-Hamelin, et al.  Expires January 3, 2019               [Page 20]

Internet-Draft           AURA Metrics & Methods                July 2018


   response includes the incoming interface where a router received the
   MPLS Echo request.  The MPLS Echo reply further informs which of the
   n addresses relevant for the load sharing decision results in a
   particular next hop interface and contains the next hop's interface
   address (if available).  This ensures that the next hop will receive
   a properly coded MPLS Echo request in the next step route of
   assessment.

   RFC to be 8403 (draft-ietf-spring-oam-usecase-10) explains how a
   central Path Monitoring System could be used to detect arbitrary MPLS
   paths between any routers within a single MPLS domain.  The
   combination of MPLS forwarding, Segment Routing and MPLS traceroute
   offers a simple architecture and a powerful mechanism to detect and
   validate (segment routed) MPLS paths.
