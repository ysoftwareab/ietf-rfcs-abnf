             PCEP Extensions for Receiving SRLG Information
                      draft-dhody-pce-recv-srlg-00

Abstract

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides functions of path
   computation in support of traffic engineering in networks controlled
   by Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS
   (GMPLS).

   This document provides extensions for the Path Computation Element
   Protocol (PCEP) to receive Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) information
   during path computation via encoding this information in the path
   computation reply message.

1.  Introduction

   As per [RFC4655], PCE based path computation model is deployed in
   large, multi-domain, multi-region, or multi-layer networks.  In such
   case PCEs may cooperate with each other to provide end to end optimal
   path.

   It is important to understand which TE links in the network might be
   at risk from the same failures.  In this sense, a set of links may
   constitute a 'shared risk link group' (SRLG) if they share a resource

Internet-Draft                  PCE-SRLG                    January 2014


   whose failure may affect all links in the set [RFC4202].  H-LSP
   (Hierarchical LSP) or S-LSP (Stitched LSP) can be used for carrying
   one or more other LSPs as described in [RFC4206] and [RFC6107].
   H-LSP and S-LSP may be computed by PCE(s) and further form as a TE
   link.  The SRLG information of such LSPs can be obtained during path
   computation itself and encoded in the PCEP Path Computation Reply
   (PCRep) message.  [I-D.zhang-ccamp-gmpls-uni-app] describes the use
   of a PCE for end to end User-Network Interface (UNI) path
   computation.

   Note that [I-D.ietf-ccamp-rsvp-te-srlg-collect] specifies a extension
   to Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) where
   SRLG information is collected at the time of signaling.  But in case
   a PCE or cooperating PCEs are used for path computation it is
   recommended that SRLG information is provided by the PCE(s).

   [I-D.farrel-interconnected-te-info-exchange] describes a scaling
   problem with SRLGs in multi-layer environment and introduce a concept
   of Macro SRLG.  Lower layer SRLG is received at the time of path
   computation and can be the basis to generate such a Macro SRLG at the
   PCE.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used in this document.

   CPS:  Confidential Path Segment.  A segment of a path that contains
      nodes and links that the policy requires not to be disclosed
      outside the domain.

   PCE:  Path Computation Element.  An entity (component, application,
      or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or
      route based on a network graph and applying computational
      constraints.

   SRLG:  Shared Risk Link Group.

   UNI:  User-Network Interface.

3.  PCEP Requirements

   Following key requirements are identified for PCEP to receive SRLG
   information during path computation:

   SRLG Indication:  The PCEP speaker must be capable of indicating
      whether the SRLG information of the path should be received during
      the path computation procedure.

   SRLG:  If requested, the SRLG information should be received during
      the path computation and encoded in the PCRep message.

   Cooperating PCEs [RFC4655] with inter-PCE Communication work together
   to provide the end to end optimal path as well as the SRLG
   information of this path.  During inter-domain or inter-layer path
   computation, the aggregating PCE (Parent PCE [RFC6805] or Ingress
   PCE(1) [RFC5441] or Higher-Layer PCE [RFC5623]) should receive the
   SRLG information of path segments from other PCEs and provide the end
   to end SRLG information of the optimal path to the Path Computation
   Client (PCC).

4.  Extension to PCEP

   This document extends the existing RP (Request Parameters) object
   [RFC5440] so that a PCEP speaker can request SRLG information during
   path computation.  The SRLG subobject maybe carried inside the
   Explicit Route Object (ERO) in the PCRep message.

4.1.  The Extension of the RP Object

   This document adds the following flags to the RP Object:

   S (SRLG - 1 bit):  when set, in a PCReq message, this indicates that
      the SRLG information of the path should be provided in the PCRep
      message.  Otherwise, when cleared, this indicates that the SRLG
      information should not be included in the PCRep message.  In a
      PCRep message, when the S bit is set this indicates that the
      returned path in ERO also carry the SRLG information; otherwise
      (when the S bit is cleared), the returned path does not carry SRLG
      information.

4.2.  SRLG Subobject in ERO

   As per [RFC5440], ERO is used to encode the path and is carried
   within a PCRep message to provide the computed path when computation
   was successful.

Internet-Draft                  PCE-SRLG                    January 2014


   The SRLG of a path is the union of the SRLGs of the links in the path
   [RFC4202].  The SRLG subobject is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-rsvp-te-srlg-collect], as shown below:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |      Type     |     Length    |  Reserved     |    Flags      |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                 SRLG ID 1 (4 bytes)                           |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      ~                           ......                              ~
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                 SRLG ID n (4 bytes)                           |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The meaning and description of Type, Length and SRLG ID can be found
   in [I-D.ietf-ccamp-rsvp-te-srlg-collect].  Bits in the Flags field
   are ignored.

   The SRLG subobject should be encoded inside the ERO object in the
   PCRep message when the S-Bit (SRLG) is set in the PCReq message.

5.  Other Considerations

5.1.  Backward Compatibility

   If a PCE receives a request and the PCE does not understand the new
   SRLG flag in the RP object, then the PCE SHOULD reject the request.

   If PCEP speaker receives a PCRep message with SRLG subobject that it
   does not support or recognize, it must act according to the existing
   processing rules.

5.2.  Confidentiality via PathKey

   [RFC5520] defines a mechanism to hide the contents of a segment of a
   path, called the Confidential Path Segment (CPS).  The CPS may be
   replaced by a path-key that can be conveyed in the PCEP and signaled
   within in a RSVP-TE ERO.

   When path-key confidentiality is used, encoding SRLG information in
   PCRep along with the path-key could be useful to compute a SRLG
   disjoint backup path at the later instance.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not add any new security concerns beyond those
   discussed in [RFC5440].

7.  Manageability Considerations

7.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new control of
   function and policy requirements.

7.2.  Information and Data Models

   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-mib] describes the PCEP MIB, there are no new MIB
   Objects for this document.

7.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new liveness
   detection and monitoring requirements in addition to those already
   listed in [RFC5440].

7.4.  Verify Correct Operations

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new operation
   verification requirements in addition to those already listed in
   [RFC5440].

7.5.  Requirements On Other Protocols

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new requirements
   on other protocols.

7.6.  Impact On Network Operations

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not have any impact on network
   operations in addition to those already listed in [RFC5440].

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA assigns values to PCEP parameters in registries defined in
   [RFC5440].  IANA is requested to make the following additional
   assignments.

Internet-Draft                  PCE-SRLG                    January 2014


8.1.  New Subobjects for the ERO Object

   IANA has previously assigned an Object-Class and Object-Type to the
   ERO carried in PCEP messages [RFC5440].  IANA also maintains a list
   of subobject types valid for inclusion in the ERO.

   IANA is requested to assign one new subobject types for inclusion in
   the ERO as follows:

              Subobject        Meaning                Reference
               34 (TBD)        SRLG sub-object        This document
