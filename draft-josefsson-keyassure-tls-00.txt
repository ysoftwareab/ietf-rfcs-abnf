      Confirming the Certificate structure in TLS with Secure DNS
                    draft-josefsson-keyassure-tls-00

Abstract

   TLS supports X.509 and OpenPGP certificate based mechanisms to
   authenticate a server.  Users want their applications to verify that
   the certificate provided by the TLS server is in fact associated with
   the domain name they expect.  Instead of trusting a certificate
   authority to have made this association correctly, and an X.509/
   OpenPGP implementation to validate that properly, the user might
   instead trust the authoritative DNS server for the domain name to
   make that association.  This document describes how to use secure DNS
   to associate the certificate chain transferred by TLS with the
   intended domain name.

Internet-Draft           DNSSEC TLS Certificate              August 2010


1.  Introduction and Background

   This document provides Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246]
   clients with an alternative way to authenticate the binding between
   the server's certificate and the domain name expected by the user.

   TLS transfers the certificate from the server to the client using the
   Certificate structure, see section 7.4.2 of RFC 5246.  We treat this
   structure as an opaque value, which results in that we support both
   X.509 and OpenPGP certificates directly.

   Normally the binding between certificate and domain name is verified
   by using the normal PKIX [RFC5280] or OpenPGP [RFC5081] validation
   algorithm, possibly together with an application protocol profile.  A
   good overview of the current state is given by
   [I-D.saintandre-tls-server-id-check].

   This document specify a way to directly authenticate the server
   certificate provided by a TLS server using DNSSEC [RFC4033] using the
   CERT record [RFC4398].  We specify a new CERT RR type to hold a hash
   of the Certificate structure sent by a TLS server to a client.


2.  The TLSCERT Certificate Type of the CERT RR

   The CERT RR [RFC4398] allows expansion by defining new certificate
   types.  The new certificate type "TLSCERT" is defined here.  A query
   on a domain name for the CERT RR may return records of the type CERT,
   and zero or more of those CERT responses can be of type TLSCERT.

   The format of the TLSCERT certificate type is binary.  The record
   contains the SHA-256 [FIPS.180-2.2002] hash of the Certificate
   structure as transferred from the TLS server to the client, including
   the length field.

   [[Rationale: Use of the SHA-256 provides an yet unbroken hash of the
   data, and stronger hashes are of questionable utility with this
   method given that Secure DNS normally has other weaker parts due to
   performance reasons.  Of course this approach is open for
   discussion.]]

   The protocol (TCP or UDP) and port number is specified as part of the
   resource domain name as follows:

   _443._tcp.example.com. IN CERT TLSCERT 0 0
                          IN1eoUHi9eb9nkCeROH5FmkdTKXQ/hmOM0mXjC2LM/I=
   _5060._udp.example.com. IN CERT TLSCERT 0 0
                          R4UWsL/fwtOZp62gFHspEQY5v8iczDI20ZBOwMBQ1Hw=

   [[Rationale: Letting the protocol and port number be part of the
   owner name reduces transfer sizes of the CERT record in situations
   where there would otherwise be multiple CERT records for unrelated
   services on the same domain name.]]


3.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to register and allocate a number for a new
   CERT RR certificate type TLSCERT.


4.  Acknowledgements

   Inspiration for this solution was drawn on earlier works in this
   area.  Further, text were borrowed from
   draft-hoffman-keys-linkage-from-dns-00.
