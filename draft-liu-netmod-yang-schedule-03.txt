1. Introduction

   This document introduces a YANG [RFC6020] data model for
   configuration scheduling. This model can be used together with other
   YANG data models to specify a schedule applied on a configuration
   data node, so that the configuration data can take effect according
   to the schedule. Such a configuration schedule can be one-time or
   recurring, with its properties persistently saved in the datastores
   of the management system server.

   The mechanism described in this document is designed to complement
   the one described in [RFC7758], which defines a capability extension
   to NETCONF to allow time-triggered RPCs. Such RPCs can be executed at
   a future time moment, but cannot be repeated and is not saved in the
   persistent datastores.

1.1. Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14, [RFC2119].

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6020] and are not redefined
   here:

      o  augment

      o  data model

      o  data node

2. Motivation

   Some applications benefit from resource scheduling to allow operators
   to plan ahead of time. Traffic engineering is one of such examples
   [RFC7399]. When configuration and state models are designed for such
   applications, it has been considered that certain data objects need
   to be configured according to predefined schedules. In other
   situations, operators need to de-configure certain data objects at
   predefined schedules for the purposes such as maintenance. These data
   objects are interpreted and implemented by the applicable
   applications.

   Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) is another example for
   which the scheduled configuration can be used, where a long-lived,
   reliable, low-latency sequenced data delivery session is
   unsustainable. Section 4.3 of [I-D.birrane-dtn-ama] describes the
   Autonomous Parameterized Control. Time-based event is one of the two
   types of triggers in such a system.

3. Configuration Scheduling YANG Data Model Overview

   This document defines a YANG data model that specifies configuration
   schedules for other YANG data models. For each targeted configuration
   data object or a group of configuration data objects, an entry is

Internet-Draft     draft-liu-netmod-yang-schedule-03         March 2017


   specified along with requested schedules using this configuration
   schedule model. The application implementing the targeted schema
   nodes implements the configuration schedules, configuring or de-
   configuring the specified objects according to the specified
   schedules. The model schema of the targeted application does not need
   changes, so the data model described in this document can be used for
   any data model. The configuration scheduling YANG data model has the
   following structure:

   module: ietf-schedule
      +--rw configuration-schedules
         +--rw target* [object]
            +--rw object        yang:xpath1.0
            +--rw operation?    operation
            +--rw data-value?   anydata
            +--rw schedules
            |  +--rw schedule* [schedule-id]
            |     +--rw schedule-id            uint32
            |     +--rw inclusive-exclusive?   enumeration
            |     +--rw start?                 yang:date-and-time
            |     +--rw schedule-duration?     string
            |     +--rw repeat-interval?       string
            +--ro state
            |  +--ro future-executions
            |     +--ro execution* [start]
            |        +--ro start        yang:date-and-time
            |        +--ro duration?    string
            |        +--ro operation?   operation
            +---n execution
               +---- operation    operation
               +---- datetime?    yang:date-and-time
               +---- results?     anydata

4. Usage Example

   The following model defines a list of TE (Traffic Engineering) links
   which can be configured with specified schedules:

   module: example
      +--rw te-links
         +--rw te-link* [id]
            +--rw id         string

            +--rw enabled?   boolean

   The following configuration requests that

      o  link-1 is configured weekly for five one-day periods, starting
         from 2016-09-12T23:20:50.52Z.

      o  link-2 is de-configured for two hours, starting from 2016-09-
         15T01:00:00.00Z.

5. Relations to Datastores

   NETCONF defines configuration datastores and operations that can be
   used to access these datastores. The configuration data encoded
   according to this data model is persistently saved in the proper
   datastores in the same way as other data model, such as ietf-
   interfaces.

5.1. Validation

   When configuration data based on this model is received, the server
   MUST perform syntax validations on the received data nodes, and
   examine the requested schedules. The server does not validate whether
   requested target configuration data can be applied to the target
   configuration objects, until the actual scheduled time arrives.

   At each scheduled time moment, the server applies the requested
   target configuration data to the target configuration objects. The
   server MUST  perform the validations on the target configuration data
   along with the current target configuration objects in the proper
   datastore.

5.2. Schedules Expansion and Operational States

   The server SHOULD expand these schedules and expose them to the
   client as operational states.

5.3. Server Executions at Scheduled Moments

   At each scheduled time moment, the server applies the requested
   target configuration data to the target configuration objects, as if
   an RPC request is newly received. Whether such a time-triggered
   configuration is successfully applied depends on the configuration
   data of the target object and requested configuration data. The
   results of such executions are sent to the client through
   notifications. The notification management mechanism described in [I-
   D.ietf-netconf-yang-push] and [I-D.ietf-netconf-rfc5277bis] can be

Internet-Draft     draft-liu-netmod-yang-schedule-03         March 2017


   used to enable, disable, subscribe, filter, and replay the
   notifications.

5.4. Interactions with Locks

   The rules of datastore lock specified by NETCONF [RFC6241] are
   checked when the schedule configuration data is received and when the
   target configuration data is applied.

5.5. Interactions with Authorization Mechanism

   If the server implements any authorization mechanism, the
   authorization rules MUST be checked against this data model schema
   when the schedule configuration data is received. At each scheduled
   time moment, the authorization rules MUST be checked against the
   target objects by using the target configuration data. To check the
   authorization rules, the server uses the same client credential
   learned when the initial configuration data was received.

6. Synchronization Aspects

   The scheduling mechanisms described in this document assume that
   servers have access to the wall-clock time. Thus, servers are
   required to acquire the time-of-day from an external time source, for
   example using the Network Time Protocol [RFC5905], or the Precision
   Time Protocol [IEEE1588].

   It is assumed that the client and servers rely on a common time
   source, so as to guarantee that schedules are defined with respect to
   a common reference. In order to avoid the potential ambiguity of
   different time zones and daylight saving time, it is recommended to
   define all schedules in the UTC time zone, using the suffix 'Z'. For
   example, the time 2016-09-12T23:20:50.52Z, is specified with respect
   to the UTC time zone.

8. Security Considerations

   The configuration, state, action and notification data defined in
   this document are designed to be accessed via the NETCONF protocol
   [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer,
   and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH)
   [RFC6242]. The NETCONF access control model [RFC6536] provides the
   means to restrict access for particular NETCONF users to a pre-
   configured subset of all available NETCONF protocol operations and
   contents.

   The functionality defined in this memo can potentially allow network
   reconnaissance; by gathering information about schedules an attacker
   can learn about the network policy, its temporal behavior, and future
   events.

   The schedule YANG model defines schedules that are writable,
   creatable, and deletable. Therefore, this model may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. An attacker may
   maliciously configure a schedule in a way that disrupts the normal
   behavior of the network. Furthermore, an attacker may attempt to
   maliciously set a schedule or a set of schedules in a way that
   amplifies an attack, or schedules an attack to a particularly
   sensitive time instant.

   The use of configuration scheduling implicitly assumes that there is
   an underlying synchronization or time distribution mechanism.
   Therefore, an attack on the synchronization mechanism may compromise
   the configuration scheduling. The security considerations of time
   protocols are discussed further in [RFC 7384].
