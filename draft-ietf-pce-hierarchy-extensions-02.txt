              Hierarchical Path Computation Elements (PCE)
                 draft-ietf-pce-hierarchy-extensions-02

Abstract

   The Hierarchical Path Computation Element (H-PCE) architecture,
   provides a mechanism to allow the optimum sequence of domains to be 
   selected,and the optimum end-to-end path to be derived through the 
   use of a hierarchical relationship between domains.

   This document defines the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP)
   extensions for the purpose of implementing Hierarchical PCE
   procedures which are described in the aforementioned document. These
   extensions are experimental and published for examination, 
   discussion, implementation, and evaluation.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC6805] describes a Hierarchical PCE (H-PCE) architecture which can
   be used for computing end-to-end paths for inter-domain MPLS Traffic
   Engineering (TE) and GMPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs).

   Within the hierarchical PCE architecture, the parent PCE is used to
   compute a multi-domain path based on the domain connectivity
   information.  A child PCE may be responsible for a single domain or
   multiple domains, it is used to compute the intra-domain path based
   on its domain topology information.

   The H-PCE end-to-end domain path computation procedure is described
   below:

   o  A path computation client (PCC) sends the inter-domain path
      computation requests to the child PCE responsible for its domain;

   o  The child PCE forwards the request to the parent PCE;

   o  The parent PCE computes the likely domain paths from the ingress
      domain to the egress domain;

   o  The parent PCE sends the intra-domain path computation requests
      (between the domain border nodes) to the child PCEs which are
      responsible for the domains along the domain path;

   o  The child PCEs return the intra-domain paths to the parent PCE;

   o  The parent PCE constructs the end-to-end inter-domain path based
      on the intra-domain paths;

   o  The parent PCE returns the inter-domain path to the child PCE;

   o  The child PCE forwards the inter-domain path to the PCC.

   In addition, the parent PCE may be requested to provide only the
   sequence of domains to a child PCE so that alternative inter-domain

   path computation procedures, including Per Domain (PD) [RFC5152] and
   Backwards Recursive Path Computation (BRPC) [RFC5441] may be used.

   This document defines the PCEP extensions for the purpose of
   implementing Hierarchical PCE procedures, which are described in
   [RFC6805].

1.1.  Scope

   The following functions are out of scope of this document.

   o  Finding end point addresses;

   o  Parent Traffic Engineering Database (TED) methods;

   o  Domain connectivity;

   The document also uses a number of [editor notes] to describe options
   and alternative solutions.  These options and notes will be removed
   before publication once agreement is reached.

1.2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC4655], [RFC5440]
   and the additional terms defined in section 1.4 of [RFC6805].

1.3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Requirements for H-PCE

   This section compiles the set of requirements of the PCEP protocol to
   support the H-PCE architecture and procedures.

   [RFC6805] identifies high-level requirements of PCEP extensions
   required to support the hierarchical PCE model.

2.1.  PCEP Requests

   The PCReq messages are used by a PCC or PCE to make a path
   computation request to a PCE.  In order to achieve the full
   functionality of the H-PCE procedures, the PCReq message needs to
   include:

   o  Qualification of PCE Requests;


Zhang, et al.                  July, 2015                      [Page 4]
Internet-Draft          PCEP Extensions for H-PCE          January 2015


   o  Multi-domain Objective Functions (OF);

   o  Multi-domain Metrics.

2.1.1.  Qualification of PCEP Requests

   As described in section 4.8.1 of [RFC6805], the H-PCE architecture
   introduces new request qualifications, which are:

   o  It MUST be possible for a child PCE to indicate that a request it
      sends to a parent PCE should be satisfied by a domain sequence
      only, that is, not by a full end-to-end path.  This allows the
      child PCE to initiate a per-domain (PD) [RFC5152] or a backward
      recursive path computation (BRPC) [RFC5441].

   o  As stated in [RFC6805], section 4.5, if a PCC knows the egress
      domain, it can supply this information as the path computation
      request.  It SHOULD be possible to specify the destination domain
      information in a PCEP request, if it is known.

2.1.2.  Multi-domain Objective Functions

   For inter-domain path computation, there are two new objective
   functions which are defined in section 1.3.1 and 4.1 of [RFC6805]:

   o  Minimize the number of domains crossed.  A domain can be either an
      Autonomous System (AS) or an Internal Gateway Protocol (IGP) area
      depending on the type of multi-domain network hierarchical PCE is
      applied to.

   o  Disallow domain re-entry.[Editor's note: Disallow domain re-entry
      may not be an objective function, but an option in the request].

   During the PCEP session establishment procedure, the parent PCE needs
   to be capable of indicating the Objective Functions (OF) capability
   in the Open message.  This capability information may then be
   announced by child PCEs, and used for selecting the PCE when a PCC
   wants a path that satisfies one or multiple inter-domain objective
   functions.

   When a PCC requests a PCE to compute an inter-domain path, the PCC
   needs also to be capable of indicating the new objective functions
   for inter-domain path.  Note that a given child PCE may also act as a
   parent PCE.

   For the reasons described previously, new OF codes need to be defined
   for the new inter-domain objective functions.  Then the PCE can
   notify its new inter-domain objective functions to the PCC by
   carrying them in the OF-list TLV which is carried in the OPEN object.
   The PCC can specify which objective function code to use, which is

Zhang, et al.                  July, 2015                      [Page 5]
Internet-Draft          PCEP Extensions for H-PCE          January 2015


   carried in the OF object when requesting a PCE to compute an inter-
   domain path.

   The proposed solution may need to differentiate between the OF code
   that is requested at the parent level, and the OF code that is
   requested at the intra-domain (child domain).

   A parent PCE MUST be capable of ensuring homogeneity, across domains,
   when applying OF codes for strict OF intra-domain requests.

2.1.3.  Multi-domain Metrics

   For inter-domain path computation, there are several path metrics of
   interest [Editor's note: Current framework only mentions metric
   objectives.  The metric itself should be also defined]:

   o  Domain count (number of domains crossed);

   o  Border Node count.

   A PCC may be able to limit the number of domains crossed by applying
   a limit on these metrics.

2.2.  Parent PCE Capability Discovery

   Parent and child PCE relationships are likely to be configured.
   However, as mentioned in [RFC6805], it would assist network operators
   if the child and parent PCE could indicate their H-PCE capabilities.

   During the PCEP session establishment procedure, the child PCE needs
   to be capable of indicating to the parent PCE whether it requests the
   parent PCE capability or not.  Also, during the PCEP session
   establishment procedure, the parent PCE needs to be capable of
   indicating whether its parent capability can be provided or not.
   
2.3.  PCE Domain and PCE ID Discovery

   A PCE domain is a single domain with an associated PCE.  Although it
   is possible for a PCE to manage multiple domains.  The PCE domain may
   be an IGP area or AS.

   The PCE ID is an IPv4 and/or IPv6 address that is used to reach the
   parent/child PCE.  It is RECOMMENDED to use an address that is always
   reachable if there is any connectivity to the PCE.

   The PCE ID information and PCE domain identifiers may be provided
   during the PCEP session establishment procedure or the domain
   connectivity information collection procedure.

3.1.  OPEN object

3.1.1.  OF Codes

   This H-PCE experiment will be carried out using the following OF 
   codes:

   o  MTD

      *  Name: Minimize the number of Transit Domains

      *  Objective Function Code

      *  Description: Find a path P such that it passes through the
         number of transit domains

   o  MBN

      *  Name: Minimize the number of border nodes.

      *  Objective Function Code

      *  Description: Find a path P such that it passes through the
         least number of border nodes

   o  DDR

      *  Name: Disallow Domain Re-entry (DDR)

      *  Objective Function Code

      *  Description: Find a path P such that does not entry a domain
         more than once

3.1.2.  OPEN Object Flags

   This H-PCE experiment will also require two OPEN object flags:

   o  Parent PCE Request bit (to be assigned by IANA, recommended bit
      0): if set, it would signal that the child PCE wishes to use the
      peer PCE as a parent PCE.

   o  Parent PCE Indication bit (to be assigned by IANA, recommended bit
      1): if set, it would signal that the PCE can be used as a parent
      PCE by the peer PCE.

3.1.3.  Domain-ID TLV

   The Domain-ID TLV for this H-PCE experiment is defined below:

   Domain Type (8 bits): Indicates the domain type.  Two types of domain
   are currently defined:

   o  Type=1: the Domain ID field carries an IGP Area ID.

   o  Type=2: the Domain ID field carries an AS number.

   Domain ID (variable): Indicates an IGP Area ID or AS number.  It can
   be 2 bytes, 4 bytes or 8 bytes long depending on the domain
   identifier used.

   [Editor's note: draft-dhody-pce-pcep-domain-sequence, section 3.2
   deals with the encoding of domain sequences, using ERO-subobjects.
   Work is ongoing to define domain identifiers for OSPF-TE areas, IS-IS
   area (which are variable sized), 2-byte and 4-byte AS number, and any
   other domain that may be defined in the future.  It uses RSVP-TE
   subobject discriminators, rather than new type 1/ type 2.  A domain
   sequence may be encoded as a route object.  The "VALUE" part of the
   TLV could follow common RSVP-TE subobject format:

                           Figure 3: PCE-ID TLV

   Address Type (16 bits): Indicates the address type of PCE IP Address.
   1 means IPv4 address type, 2 means IPv6 address type.

   PCE IP Address: Indicates the reachable address of a PCE.

   [Editor's note: [RFC5886] already defines the PCE-ID object.  If a
   semantically equivalent PCE-ID TLV is needed (to avoid modifying
   message grammars to include the object), it can align with the PCEP
   object: in any case, the length (4 / 16 bytes) can be used to know
   whether it is an IPv4 or an IPv6 PCE, the address type is not
   needed.]

3.2.  RP object

3.2.1.  RP Object Flags

   The following RP object flags are defined for this H-PCE experiment:

   o  Domain Path Request bit: if set, it means the child PCE wishes to 
      get the domain sequence;

   o  Destination Domain Query bit: if set, it means the parent PCE 
      wishes to get the destination domain ID.

3.2.2.  Domain-ID TLV

   The format of this TLV is defined in Section 3.1.3.  This TLV can be
   carried in an OPEN object to indicate a (list of) managed domains, or
   carried in a RP object to indicate the destination domain ID when a
   child PCE responds to the parent PCE's destination domain query by a
   PCRep message.

   [Editors note.  In some cases, the Parent PCE may need to allocate a
   node which is not necessarily the destination node.]

Internet-Draft          PCEP Extensions for H-PCE          January 2015


3.3.  Metric Object

   There are two new metrics defined in this document for H-PCE:

   o  Domain count (number of domains crossed);

   o  Border Node Count (number of border nodes crossed).

3.4.  PCEP-ERROR object

3.4.1.  Hierarchy PCE Error-Type

   A new PCEP Error-Type is used for this H-PCE experiment and is 
   defined below:

   +------------+------------------------------------------------------+
   | Error-Type | Meaning                                              |
   +------------+------------------------------------------------------+
   | 19         | H-PCE error Error-value=1: parent PCE capability     |
   |            | cannot be provided                                   |
   +------------+------------------------------------------------------+

                             H-PCE error table

3.5.  NO-PATH Object

   To communicate the reason(s) for not being able to find a multi-
   domain path or domain sequence, the NO-PATH object can be used in the
   PCRep message.  [RFC5440] defines the format of the NO-PATH object.
   The object may contain a NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV to provide additional
   information about why a (domain) path computation has failed.

   Three new bit flags are defined to be carried in the Flags field in
   the NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV carried in the NO-PATH Object.

   o  Bit 23: When set, the parent PCE indicates that destination domain
      unknown;

   o  Bit 22: When set, the parent PCE indicates unresponsive child 
      PCE(s);

   o  Bit 21: When set, the parent PCE indicates no available resource
      available in one or more domain(s).


4.  H-PCE Procedures

4.1.  OPEN Procedure between Child PCE and Parent PCE


Zhang, et al.                  July, 2015                     [Page 10]
Internet-Draft          PCEP Extensions for H-PCE          January 2015


   If a child PCE wants to use the peer PCE as a parent, it can set the
   parent PCE request bit in the OPEN object carried in the Open message
   during the PCEP session creation procedure.  If the peer PCE does not
   want to provide the parent function to the child PCE, it must send a
   PCErr message to the child PCE and clear the parent PCE indication
   bit in the OPEN object.

   If the parent PCE can provide the parent function to the peer PCE, it
   may set the parent PCE indication bit in the OPEN object carried in
   the Open message during the PCEP session creation procedure.

   The PCE may also report its PCE ID and list of domain ID to the peer
   PCE by specifying them in the PCE-ID TLV and List of Domain-ID TLVs
   in the OPEN object carried in the Open message during the PCEP
   session creation procedure.

   The OF codes defined in this document can be carried in the OF-list
   TLV of the OPEN object.  If the OF-list TLV carries the OF codes, it
   means that the PCE is capable of implementing the corresponding
   objective functions.  This information can be used for selecting a
   proper parent PCE when a child PCE wants to get a path that satisfies
   a certain objective function.

   When a specific child PCE sends a PCReq to a peer PCE that requires
   parental activity and the peer PCE does not want to act as the parent
   for it, the peer PCE should send a PCErr message to the child PCE and
   specify the error-type (IANA) and error-value (1) in the PCEP-ERROR
   object.

4.2.  Procedure to obtain Domain Sequence

   If a child PCE only wants to get the domain sequence for a multi-
   domain path computation from a parent PCE, it can set the Domain Path
   Request bit in the RP object carried in a PCReq message.  The parent
   PCE which receives the PCReq message tries to compute a domain
   sequence for it.  If the domain path computation succeeds the parent
   PCE sends a PCRep message which carries the domain sequence in the
   ERO to the child PCE.  The domain sequence is specified as AS or AREA
   ERO sub-objects (type 32 for AS [RFC3209] or a to-be-defined IGP area
   type).  Otherwise it sends a PCReq message which carries the NO-PATH
   object to the child PCE.


5.  Error Handling

   A PCE that is capable of acting as a parent PCE might not be
   configured or willing to act as the parent for a specific child PCE.

   This fact could be determined when the child sends a PCReq that
   requires parental activity (such as querying other child PCEs), and

Zhang, et al.                  July, 2015                     [Page 11]
Internet-Draft          PCEP Extensions for H-PCE          January 2015


   could result in a negative response in a PCEP Error (PCErr) message
   and indicate the hierarchy PCE error types.

   Additionally, the parent PCE may fail to find the multi-domain path
   or domain sequence due to one or more of the following reasons:

   o  A child PCE cannot find a suitable path to the egress;

   o  The parent PCE do not hear from a child PCE for a specified time;

   o  The objective functions specified in the path request cannot be
      met.

   In this case, the parent PCE MAY need to send a negative path
   computation reply specifying the reason.  This can be achieved by
   including NO-PATH object in the PCRep message.  Extension to NO-PATH
   object is needed to include the aforementioned reasons.


6.  Manageability Considerations

   General PCE and PCEP management considerations are discussed in 
   [RFC4655] and [RFC5440]. There are additional management 
   considerations for H-PCE which are described in [RFC6805], and 
   repeated in this section. 

   The administrative entity responsible for the management of the
   parent PCEs must be determined for the following cases:  
   
   o multi-domains (e.g., IGP areas or multiple ASes) within a single 
   service provider network, the management responsibility for the 
   parent PCE would most likely be handled by the service provider,  
   
   o multiple ASes within different service provider networks, it may 
   be necessary for a third party to manage the parent PCEs according 
   to commercial and policy agreements from each of the participating 
   service providers.
   
   [To be discussed further.]

6.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   [To be discussed further.]
   
6.1.1.  Child PCE

   Support of the hierarchical procedure will be controlled by the
   management organization responsible for each child PCE. A child 
   PCE must be configured with the address of its parent PCE in order 
   for it to interact with its parent PCE.  The child PCE must also 
   be authorized to peer with the parent PCE.

Zhang, et al.                  July, 2015                     [Page 12]
Internet-Draft          PCEP Extensions for H-PCE          January 2015

6.1.2.  Parent PCE

   The parent PCE must only accept path computation requests from
   authorized child PCEs.  If a parent PCE receives requests from an
   unauthorized child PCE, the request should be dropped. This means 
   that a parent PCE must be configured with the identities and 
   security credentials of all of its child PCEs, or there must be
   some form of shared secret that allows an unknown child PCE to be
   authorized by the parent PCE.

6.1.3.  Policy Control

   It may be necessary to maintain a policy module on the parent PCE
   [RFC5394].  This would allow the parent PCE to apply commercially
   relevant constraints such as SLAs, security, peering preferences, and
   monetary costs.

   It may also be necessary for the parent PCE to limit end-to-end path
   selection by including or excluding specific domains based on
   commercial relationships, security implications, and reliability.

6.2.  Information and Data Models

   A PCEP MIB module is defined in [RFC7420] that describes managed
   objects for modeling of PCEP communication.  A H-PCE MIB module, 
   or additional data model will be required to report parent PCE 
   and child PCE information, including:

   o  parent PCE configuration and status,

   o  child PCE configuration and information,

   o  notifications to indicate session changes between parent PCEs and
      child PCEs, and

   o  notification of parent PCE TED updates and changes.

6.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   The hierarchical procedure requires interaction with multiple PCEs.
   Once a child PCE requests an end-to-end path, a sequence of events
   occurs that requires interaction between the parent PCE and each
   child PCE.  If a child PCE is not operational, and an alternate
   transit domain is not available, then a failure must be reported.

6.4.  Verifying Correct Operation

   Verifying the correct operation of a parent PCE can be performed by
   monitoring a set of parameters.  The parent PCE implementation should
   provide the following parameters monitored by the parent PCE:

Zhang, et al.                  July, 2015                     [Page 13]
Internet-Draft          PCEP Extensions for H-PCE          January 2015


   o  number of child PCE requests,

   o  number of successful hierarchical PCE procedures completions on a
      per-PCE-peer basis,

   o  number of hierarchical PCE procedure completion failures on a per-
      PCE-peer basis, and

   o  number of hierarchical PCE procedure requests from unauthorized
      child PCEs.

6.5.  Impact on Network Operation

   The hierarchical PCE procedure is a multiple-PCE path computation
   scheme.  Subsequent requests to and from the child and parent PCEs do
   not differ from other path computation requests and should not have
   any significant impact on network operations.
    
   
7.  IANA Considerations

   Due to the experimental nature of this draft no IANA requests are 
   made.


8.  Security Considerations

   The hierarchical PCE procedure relies on PCEP and inherits the
   security requirements defined in [RFC5440]. As PCEP operates 
   over TCP, it may also make use of  TCP security mechanisms, 
   including Transport Layer Security (TLS). 
   
   H-PCE operation also relies on information used to build the TED.
   Attacks on a parent or child PCE may be achieved by falsifying 
   or impeding this flow of information. If the child PCE listens to 
   the IGP for populating the TED, then normal IGP security measures 
   may be applied, and it should be noted that an IGP routing
   system is generally assumed to be a trusted domain such that router
   subversion is not a risk. The parent PCE TED is constructed as 
   described in this document and may involve:

   o multiple parent-child relationships using PCEP 

   o the parent PCE listening to child domain IGPs (with the same
     security features as a child PCE listening to its IGP)

   o an external mechanism (such as [BGP-LS]), which will need to be
     authorized and secured.



Zhang, et al.                  July, 2015                     [Page 14]
Internet-Draft          PCEP Extensions for H-PCE          January 2015


   Any multi-domain operation necessarily involves the exchange of
   information across domain boundaries.  This is bound to represent a
   significant security and confidentiality risk especially when the
   child domains are controlled by different commercial concerns.  PCEP
   allows individual PCEs to maintain confidentiality of their domain
   path information using path-keys [RFC5520], and the H-PCE  
   architecture is specifically designed to enable as much isolation of
   domain topology and capabilities information as is possible.

   For further considerations of the security issues related to inter-AS
   path computation, see [RFC5376].

   [To be discussed further.]


9.  Implementation Status

   The H-PCE architecture and protocol procedures describe in this I-D 
   were implemented and tested for a variety of optical research 
   applications. 
   
   This work was led by:

   o  Ramon Casellas <ramon.casellas@cttc.es>
   o  Centre Tecnologic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC)

   The H-PCE instances (parent and child) were multi-threaded 
   asynchronous processes. Implemented in C++11, using C++ Boost 
   Libraries. The targeted system used to deploy and run H-PCE
   applications was a  POSIX system (Debian GNU/Linux operating 
   system). 
   
   Some parts of the software may require a Linux Kernel, the 
   availability of a Routing Controller running collocated in the same 
   host and the usage of libnetfilter / libipq and GNU/Linux 
   firewalling capabilities. Most of the functionality, including 
   algorithms is done by means of plugins (e.g., as shared libraries  
   or .so files in Unix systems). 
   
   The CTTC PCE supports the H-PCE architecture, but also supports 
   stateful PCE with active capabilities, as an OpenFlow controller, 
   and has dedicated plugins to support monitoring, BRPC, P2MP, path 
   keys, back end PCEs. Management of the H-PCE entities was supported 
   via HTTP and CLI via Telnet.
