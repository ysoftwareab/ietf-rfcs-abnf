1.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

       o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

       o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for
           the purpose of management. The first version of this
           Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and
           described in RFC 1155 [2], RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The
           second version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 2578 [5],
           RFC 2579 [6] and RFC 2580 [7].

       o   Message protocols for transferring management information.
           The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called
           SNMPv1 and described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the
           SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
           track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
           [9] and RFC 1906 [10]. The third version of the message
           protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC
           2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12].

       o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
           first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats
           is described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol
           operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC
           1905 [13].

       o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14]
           and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC
           2575 [15].



   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [16].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in

   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.


2.  Overview

   This MIB addresses the items required to manage the Frame Relay
   Forum's Implementation Agreement for Service Level Definitions
   (FRF.13 [17]).  At present, this applies to these values of the
   ifType variable in the Internet-standard MIB:


       o   frameRelay (32)

       o   frameRelayService (44)


   This section provides an overview and background of how to use this
   MIB.


2.1.  Frame Relay Service Level Definitions

   The frame relay service level definitions address specific
   characteristics of a frame relay service facilitate the following
   tasks:

       o   Evaluation of frame relay service providers, offerings or
           products.

       o   Measurement of Quality of Service.

       o   Enforcement of Service Level Agreements.

       o   Planning or describing a frame relay network.


   The following parameters are defined in FRF.13 [17] as a sufficient
   set of values to values to accomplish the tasks previously stated.

       o   Delay - The amount of time elapsed, in milliseconds, from the
           time a frame exits the source to the time it reaches the
           destination.

       o   Frame Delivery Ratio - The ratio of the number of frames
           delivered to the destination versus the number of frames sent
           by the source.  This ratio can be further divided by

Internet Draft Frame Relay Service Level Definitions MIB   June 23, 1999


           inspecting either only the frames within the CIR or only the
           frames in excess of the CIR.

       o   Data Delivery Ratio - The ratio of the amount of data
           delivered to the destination versus the amount of data sent
           by the source. This ratio can be further divided by
           inspecting either only the data within the CIR or only the
           data in excess of the CIR.

       o   Service Availability - The amount of time the frame relay
           service was not unavailable.  There are three types of
           availability statistics defined in FRF.13 [17]: Virtual
           Connection Availabity, Mean Time to Repair, and Mean Time
           Between Service Outages.  The later two require information
           about the scheduled outage time that should be maintained by
           the management software used in calculation of the values.

           Consult FRF.13 [17] for more details.

2.2.  Terminology


    o   CIR - The Committed Information Rate (CIR) is the subscriber
        data rate (expressed in bits/second) that the network commits to
        deliver under normal network conditions. [18]

    o   DLCI - Data Link Connection Identifier. [18]

    o   Logical Port - This term is used to model the Frame Relay
        interface on a device. [18]

    o   NNI - Network to Network Interface. [18]

    o   Permanent Virtual Connection (PVC) - A virtual connection that
        has its end-points and bearer capabilities defined at
        subscription time. [18]

    o   Reference Point (RP) - The point of reference within the network
        model at which the calculations or data collection takes place.

    o   UNI - User to Network Interface. [18]



2.3.  Network Model

   The basic model, as illustrated in figure 1 below, contains two frame
   relay DTE endpoints connected to a network cloud via a frame relay



Expires December 1999    Steinberger & Nicklass                 [Page 5]


Internet Draft Frame Relay Service Level Definitions MIB   June 23, 1999


   UNI interface. The network cloud can contain zero or more internal
   frame relay NNI connections that interconnect multiple networks.  The
   calculations and data collection can be performed at any reference
   point within the network.

                    Frame Relay Network Reference Model

2.4.  Reference Points

   The collection and calculations of the service level definitons apply
   to two reference points within the network. These two points are the
   locations where the frames are referenced in the collection of the
   service level specific information. The refernce points used in the
   MIB are shown in figure 2 below. For completeness, the MIB also
   allows for a proprietary reference point which can exist anywhere in
   the network that is not a previously defined reference point. Its
   meaning is insignificant unless defined by the device manufacturer.

Internet Draft Frame Relay Service Level Definitions MIB   June 23, 1999


   The MIB variables frsldPvcCtrlSrcRP and frsldPvcCtrlDstRP allow the
   user to view and, if supported, configure the reference points at
   which the calculations occur.  These variables are specific to the
   device on which they are located.  Frame relay devices act as both
   frame sources and frame destinations. The definitions in this MIB
   apply to the interaction of a pair of devices on the network path.
   The same device can potentially use different reference points for
   calculatation and collection of the statistics based on whether the
   referenced frame is sent or received by the device. When the device
   is acting as a frame source, the value of frsldPvcCtrkSrcRP reflects
   the reference point used for all source calculations pertaining to
   the specified PVC. When the device is acting as a frame destination,
   the value of frsldPvcCtrlDstRP reflects the reference point used for
   all destination calculations pertaining to the specified PVC.

   For example, FRF.13 [17] defines an Edge-to-Edge Egress Queue
   measurement domain as a domain in which measurement is performed
   between an Ingress Reference Point and an Egress Queue Input
   Reference Point. For this domain between a source device and a
   destination device, the value of frsldPvcCtrkSrcRP for the source
   device would be set to ingRP(2) and the value of frsldPvcCtrlDstRP
   for the destination device would be set to eqiRP(4).  While it is
   usually the case that the reference points would simply swap when
   looking at frames going in the opposite direction, there is no
   requirement for them to do so.

2.5.  Measurement Methodology

   This document neither recommends nor suggests a method of
   implementation.  This is left to the device manufacturer and should
   be independent of the data that is actually collected.

   Periodic collection of this data can be performed through either
   polling of the data table, use of the sample tables or use of the
   user history group of RFC 2021 [19].

2.6.  Collection Location

   In order to facilitate implementation independence, the location at
   which the calculations are performed must be reported.  In that these
   statistics correlate information between two devices (a source-
   destination node pair), there are multiple locations at which this
   calculation can actually take place.  These locations are specified
   using the MIB variables frsldPvcCtrlDelayLoc and
   frsldPvcCtrlDeliveryLoc.  The potential values for these variables
   have the following meanings:

       o   source - All calculations are performed at the source node

Internet Draft Frame Relay Service Level Definitions MIB   June 23, 1999


           given statistics from the destination node.  This means that
           the source node collects information from the destination
           node and reports values that are consistent with the current
           state of the network. There may be some delay in updating
           these values due to the cross-network correlation. However,
           all values should synchronized such that they act as if
           collected simultaneously. The method of cross-network
           communication is implementation independent.

           The network node being queried is acting as the source node.
           The network node at the far end of the PVC is the destination
           node.  The values of the "offered" statistics are associated
           with those frames sent by this node. The values of the
           "delivered" statistics are associated with those frames
           actually reaching the destination node. The one-way delay
           statistics are associated with packets sent from this node to
           the far-end node. The round-trip delay statistics are
           associated with packets sent by this node and received by
           this node.

       o   destination - All calculations are performed at the
           destination node given statistics from the source node.  This
           means that the destination node collects information from the
           source node and reports values that are consistent with the
           current state of the network. There may be some delay in
           updating these values due to the cross-network correlation.
           However, all values should synchronized such that they act as
           if collected simultaneously.  The method of cross-network
           communication is implementation independent.

           The network node being queried is acting as the destination
           node.  The network node at the far end of the PVC is the
           source node.  The values of the "offered" statistics are
           associated with those frames sent by this the source node.
           The values of the "delivered" statistics are associated with
           those frames actually received by this node. The one-way
           delay statistics are associated with packets sent by the far
           end node and received by this node.  The round-trip delay
           statistics are associated with packets sent by the far end
           node, received by the far end node and reported to this node.

       o   intermediate - All calculations are performed at some
           intermediate node such as a probe.  This means that both the
           source and the destination node are referenced such that the
           values reported are consistent with the current state of the
           network. There may be some delay in updating these values due
           to the cross-network correlation. However, all values should
           synchronized such that they act as if collected

           simultaneously.  The method of cross-network communication is
           implementation independent.

           The network node being queried is acting as neither the
           source nor the destination node.  The network node at one far
           end of the PVC is the source node while the other far end
           node is the destination node.  The values of the "offered"
           statistics are associated with those frames sent by this the
           source node. The values of the "delivered" statistics are
           associated with those frames actually received by the
           destination node.  The one-way delay statistics are
           associated with packets travelling from the source reference
           point to the destination reference point.  The round-trip
           delay statistics are associated with packets that leave and
           return to this node.

       o   distributed - There is no cross-network communication
           performed by the device in the collection of statistics.  The
           values in the MIB objects on this device reflect only
           information that this device knows about itself.  The source
           specific values reflect information about this device when it
           acts as the source.  Likewise, the destination specific
           values reflect information about this device when it acts as
           a destination.  It is up to the network management software
           to communicate to each device to collect the statistics.

           The network node being queried is acting as both a source and
           a destination node for separate source-destination node
           pairs. The values of the "offered" statistics are associated
           with those frames sent by this the source node and are valid
           in the context of the source-destination node pair for which
           this node is the source. The values of the "delivered"
           statistics are associated with those frames actually received
           by this node and are valid in the context of the source-
           destination node pair for which this node is the destination.
           All delay statistics for this node are deferred to the node
           at the far end.



2.7.  Use of MIB in Calculation of Service Level Definitions

   The MIB variables can be used to calculate statistics defined in
   FRF.13 [17].  For the following explanation, it is assumed that
   statistics can both be collected from the same device, i.e. the
   location type is not distributed.  Should the location be
   distributed, the manager should collect the source information from
   the source node and the network information from the network node.

   Otherwise, all information should be collected from the single device
   representing the correct end of the PVC.

2.7.1.  Delay

   The frame transfer delay is defined as the amount of time elapsed, in
   milliseconds, from the time a frame exits the source to the time it
   reaches the destination. This value can be found using the
   frsldPvcDataDelayAvg MIB variable. The delay may be calculated as
   either round trip or one way, and this information is held in the
   frsldPvcCtrlDelayType MIB variable. Should the delay be calculated as
   round trip, the value of frsldPvcDataDelayAvg represents the average
   of the total delay of the round trips.  In this case, the value
   should be divided by two to obtain the frame transfer delay. In the
   case that frsldPvcCtrlDelayType is oneWay, the value of
   frsldPvcDataDelayAvg represents the average of the frame transfer
   delays.

2.7.2.  Frame Delivery Ratio

   The frame delivery ratio is defined as the total number of frames
   delivered to the destination divided by the frames offered by the
   source.  The destination values can be obtained using FrDeliveredC
   and FrDeliveredE. The source values can be obtained using FrOfferedC
   and FrOfferedE.

                          FrDeliveredC + FrDeliveredE
   Frame Delivery Ratio = ---------------------------
                            FrOfferedC + FrOfferedE

                                     FrDeliveredC

                                  FrDeliveredE
   Excess Frame Delivery Ratio =  ------------
                                   FrOfferedE

2.7.3.  Data Delivery Ratio

   The data delivery ratio is defined as the total number of data
   delivered to the destination divided by the data offered by the
   source.  The destination values can be obtained using DataDeliveredC
   and DataDeliveredE. The source values can be obtained using
   DataOfferedC and DataOfferedE.

6.  Security Considerations

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that have a
MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects may be
considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The
support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET
(read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features
as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of the
User-based Security Model RFC 2274 [12] and the View-based Access
Control Model RFC 2275 [15] is recommended.

It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity
giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly configured to give
access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have
legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
