Status of this Memo

   This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with
   all provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups. Note that
   other groups may also distribute working documents as
   Internet-Drafts.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six

Abstract

   This memo presents SMIng modules that introduce commonly used
   Internet Protocol specific data definitions.  They are provided so
   that other SMIng modules that would otherwise define their own
   representations can import them from a common place. 

   The IRTF-NMRG-INET module defines types and classes for representing
   Internet Protocol specific information. It builds on RFC 2851 and
   extends it in several ways. 

   The IRTF-NMRG-INET-FILTER module extends the IRTF-NMRG-INET module
   by providing generic definitions for typical IP packet filters.

1. Introduction

   SMIng [1] modules frequently need to represent Internet Protocol
   specific information such as IP addresses. This memo contains SMIng
   modules which define a core set of SMIng types and classes to be
   imported by other SMIng modules. 

   The IRTF-NMRG-INET module provides core SMIng data definitions for
   the Internet Protocol suite. This module is derived from [3]. 

   The IRTF-NMRG-INET-FILTER module provides SMIng data definitions
   that model Internet Protocol filters and components thereof. 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [2].

4. Usage Examples

   The following example shows how a TCP connection might be modelled.
   The class definition below could be used to derive an IP version
   independent MIB for representing open TCP connections. 

   module IRTF-NMRG-TCP {

       import IRTF-NMRG-INET       (InetTransportEndpoint);

       // ...

       typedef TcpConnectionState {
           type    Enumeration (closed(1), listen(2), synSent(3),
                                synReceived(4), established(5),

                                finWait1(6), finWait2(7), closeWait(8),
                                lastAck(9), closing(10), timeWait(11));
           description
              "The state of a TCP connection.";
           reference
              "STD 7 (RFC 793)";
       };

       typedef TcpConnectionCtrl {
           type	Enumeration (none(0), delete(1));
   	description
   	   "The enumerated numbers defined by this type allow to control
   	    TCP connections. The value none(0) will be reported whenever
   	    an attribute of this type is read.

   	    The only value which may be written is delete(1). If a
               management station writes the value delete(1), then this
               has the effect of deleting the TCB (as defined in RFC 793)
               of the corresponding connection on the managed node,
               resulting in immediate termination of the connection.

   	    As an implementation-specific option, a RST segment may be
               sent from the managed node to the other TCP endpoint (note
               however that RST segments are not sent reliably).";
       };

       class TcpConnection {

           };
           attribute InetTransportEndpoint remote {
               description
                  "The remote endpoint of the TCP connection.";
           };
           attribute TcpConnectionState state {
               access      readonly;
               description
                  "The current state of the TCP connection.";
           };
   	attribute TcpConnectionCtrl ctrl {
   	    access	readwrite;
   	    description
   	       "A control which allows to change the state of the
   	        TCP connection.";
   	};
           description
              "This class contains information about a particular current
               TCP connection.";

5. Security Considerations

   This module does not define any management objects. Instead, it
   defines a set of SMIng types and classes which may be used by other
   SMIng modules to define management objects. These data definitions
   have no security impact on the Internet.

Appendix A. OPEN ISSUES

   1.  There might be more core type or class definitions that should
       go into the IRTF-NMRG-SMING-INET module. 
   2.  The filters probably need more work to cover more cases. 
   3.  Is it useful to include more examples, e.g. on the usage of
       filters or subnets? 
   4.  Does the InetDiffServCodePoint type definition really belong
       into this module? 
   5.  255a or 255t? Length restriction? 
   6.  Check the attribute identifiers and descriptions of
       InetTransportEndpoint and InetSubnet: when should the term
       endpoint be used, and when address? Should an InetProtocolNumber
       attribute be added to InetTransportEndpoint?
