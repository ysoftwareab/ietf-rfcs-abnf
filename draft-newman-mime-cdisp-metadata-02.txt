Abstract

     The Content-Disposition [CDISP] header defines two disposition
     types:  ``inline'' and ``attachment'' which can affect presentation
     of a MIME [MIME-IMB] body part.  There have been a number of cases
     where one MIME body part is ancillary or contains meta-data for
     another MIME body part and is neither suitable for inline display
     by itself, nor is it useful if treated as an independent attachment
     and saved to a file by itself.  If the recipient UA is not familiar
     with the specific media type, the user often is presented with a
     useless unrecognizable attachment.  This memo proposes a third
     disposition type, ``ancillary'', to address this situation.

     in this document are to be interpreted as defined in "Key words for
     use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [KEYWORDS].


2. The Ancillary Disposition Type

     A body part can be designated "ancillary" if it is ancillary to the
     primary content of the containing multipart and is unlikely to be
     useful if saved to a file by itself or viewed independently.  If an
     interpreting user agent sees an unknown media type with an
     "ancillary" disposition type, it SHOULD indicate in some way that
     the body part is unlikely to be useful to the user.

     For example, in a multipart/appledouble [MACMIME], the
     application/applefile body part SHOULD have an "ancillary"
     disposition type as it is usually useless by itself.

     In a multipart/security [MIME-SEC], the signature body part can be
     useless without the text it signs and thus might have a disposition
     type of "ancillary."

     If a client automatically attaches ancillary information to every
     message sent (e.g., a vcard [VCARD] or vendor proprietary
     information intended for special processing by a recipient running
     the same software), that information is a good candidate for this
     label.


2. Amended Formal Syntax

     This amends the formal syntax [ABNF] for "disposition-type"
     [CDISP]:

         disposition-type =/ "ancillary"


3. Security Considerations

     This does not add additional security considerations beyond those
     which already apply to the Content-Disposition header field
     [CDISP].
