 Using Multiple Signing Algorithms with the ARC (Authenticated Received
                            Chain) Protocol
                     draft-ietf-dmarc-arc-multi-00

Abstract

   The Authenticated Received Chain (ARC) protocol creates a mechanism
   whereby a series of handlers of an email message can conduct
   authentication of the email message as it passes among them on the
   way to its destination.

   Initial development of ARC has been done with a single allowed
   signing algorithm, but parallel work in the DCRUP working group
   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/dcrup/about/) is expanding the
   supported algorithms.  This specification defines how to extend ARC
   for multiple signing algorithms.

1.  Introduction

   The Authenticated Received Chain (ARC) protocol adds a traceable
   chain of signatures that cover the handling of an email message
   through a chain of intermediary handlers.

   Initial development of ARC has been done with a single allowed
   signing algorithm, but parallel work in the DCRUP working group
   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/dcrup/about/) is expanding the
   supported algorithms.  This specification defines how to extend ARC
   for multiple signing algorithms.

2.  Overview

   In order to phase in new signing algorithms, this specification
   identifies how signers and validators MUST process ARC sets found in
   email messages.

3.  Definitions and Terminology

   This section defines terms used in the rest of the document.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Because many of the core concepts and definitions are found in
   [RFC5598], readers SHOULD to be familiar with the contents of
   [RFC5598], and in particular, the potential roles of intermediaries
   in the delivery of email.

4.  Supporting Alternate Signing Algorithms

   During a period where multiple algorithms are allowed, all of the
   statements in the ARC spec which refer to "exactly one set of ARC
   headers per instance" need to be understood as "at least one set per
   instance and no more than one set per instance per algorithm".

5.  General Approach

5.1.  Signers

   Signers MUST initiate ARC signing of messages with all supported
   algorithms that they are capable of using.

   Signers MUST continue ARC chains with all supported algorithms that
   they are capable of using.

5.2.  Validators

   Validators MUST use the longest ARC chain on the message for which
   they can interpret the signing algorithm.

6.  Phases of Algorithm Evolution

6.1.  Introductory Period

   Intermediaries MUST be able to validate ARC chains built with either
   algorithm but MAY create ARC sets with either (or both) algorithm.

Internet-Draft                  ARC-Multi                   January 2018


   The introductory period should be at least six (6) months.

6.2.  Co-Existence Period

   Intermediaries MUST be able to validate ARC chains build with either
   algorithm and MUST create ARC sets with both algorithms.  Chains
   ending with either algorithm may be used for the result.

6.3.  Deprecation Period

   ARC sets built with algorithms that are being deprecated MAY be
   considered valid within an ARC chain, however, intermediaries MUST
   NOT create additional sets with the deprecated algorithm.

   The deprecation period should be at least two (2) years.

6.4.  Obsolescence Period

   ARC sets built with algorithms that are obsolete MUST NOT be
   considered valid within an ARC chain.  Intermediaries MUST NOT create
   any sets with any obsoleted algorithm.

7.  Privacy Considerations

   No unique privacy considerations are introduced by this specification
   beyond those of the base [ARC-DRAFT-11] protocol.

8.  IANA Considerations

   No new IANA considerations are introduced by this specification.

9.  Security Considerations

   No new security considerations are introduced by this specification
   beyond those of the base [ARC-DRAFT-11] protocol.
