Internet-Draft      Goals and Benefits of Multihoming       October 2005


Abstract

   This document attempts to define the goals and benefits of
   multihoming for fixed and mobile nodes (hosts and routers), i.e. from
   a node point of view, as investigated in the Monami6 WG, and not from
   a site point of view as investigated in the Shim6 WG.  Those goals
   and benefits are illustrated with a set of scenarios.  This document
   is generic in the sense that the benefits of node multihoming can be
   shared by both fixed end nodes and mobile end nodes.  It is intended
   to satisfy the first item as specified on the Monami6 charter and as
   such, working group approval as a working group document will be
   sought.

Internet-Draft      Goals and Benefits of Multihoming       October 2005


1.  Introduction

   New equipments shipped on the market now often integrate several
   access technologies (both wired and wireless).  The main purpose of
   this integration is to federate all means of communications in order
   to access the Internet ubiquitously (from everywhere and at any time)
   as no single technology can be expected to be deployed everywhere.
   Flows may thus be redirected from one interface to the other due to
   the loss of connectivity or change of the network conditions.

   Several access technologies are also integrated in order to increase
   bandwidth availability or to select the the most appropriate
   technology according to the type of flow or choices of the user.
   Basically, each network interface has different cost, performance,
   bandwidth, access range, and reliability.  Users are also willing to
   select the most appropriate set of network interface(s) depending on
   the network environment, particularly in wireless networks which are
   mutable and less reliable than wired networks.  Users should also be
   able to select the most appropriate interface per communication type
   or to combine a set of interfaces to get sufficient bandwidth.

   The purpose of this document is to emphasize the goals and benefits
   of multihoming for fixed and mobile hosts and routers in a generic
   fashion, i.e. without focusing on issues pertaining to hosts, or
   routers, or mobility.

   Issues pertaining to site multihoming in fixed networks are discussed
   in [1].  Mobility issues pertaining to mobile nodes and mobile
   networks are respectively discussed in companion drafts [2] and [3].
   Our document is targetted to IPv6, although our analysis may be
   applicable to IPv4 as well.  The readers may refer to [4] for a
   description of the problem specific to Mobile IPv4.

   This document is organized as follows: we first define the terms used
   in the document before illustrating the motivations by means of some
   scenarios in Section 3.  These scenarios are then used to emphasize
   the goals and benefits of multihoming in Section 4.  Next follows in
   Section 5 an analysis of the multihoming configurations according to
   two different cases (the node either has a single interface or
   multiple interfaces).  We conclude in Section 6 with a number of
   generic issues that will have to be solved for the node to benefit
   effectively from its multihomed configuration.

2.  Terminology

   This draft is based on the terminology defined in [5].  For the
   purpose of clarity, we remind the definition of interface.  Terms
   related to multihoming are not known to be defined in existing IETF
   RFCs.

   Interface

      A node's point of attachment to a link (from [5])

   Multihomed Node

      A node (either a host or a router) is multihomed when it has
      several IPv6 addresses to choose between, i.e. in the following
      cases when it is either:

      *  multi-prefixed: multiple prefixes are advertised on the link(s)
         the node is attached to, or.

      *  multi-interfaced: the node has multiple interfaces to choose
         between, on the same link or not.

3.  Scenarios and Motivations

   The following real-life scenarios highlight the motivations for
   multihoming.  Each scenario usually yields more than one of the goals
   and benefits outlined in Section 4.  All scenarios focus on wireless
   technologies though no mobility management may be involved (one can
   use wireless access at office).

   The first scenario focuses on using two wireless interfaces for the
   purpose of increasing aggregate bandwidth while the second shows the
   usage of preference settings.  The third is a combination of the
   first two.  The fourth and fifth illustrate how multiple connections
   can provide ubiquitous Internet access and how load can be balanced
   according to some preferences.  The last one illustrates reliabilty.

3.1.  Need to Accelerate Transmission

   Mona is at the airport waiting to board the plane.  She receives a
   call from her husband.  This audio communication is received via a
   wireless local area network (WLAN) link realized over one of the
   available hot-spots.  She knows this is going to be a long flight and
   wishes to catch up on some work.  Mona uses a WLAN connection to
   download the necessary data.  However, there is not enough time and
   Mona decides to accelerate the download.  Her notebook is equipped
   with an additional WLAN interface.  Mona decides to use this
   additional WLAN interface to connect to another access point, and
   distribute the different download flows between the two wireless
   interfaces.

3.2.  Need to Redirect Established Sessions

   Oliver is on his way to work waiting at a train station.  He uses
   this opportunity and the presence of a WLAN hot-spot to download the
   news from his favorite on-line news channel.  His train is announced.
   Oliver decides to buy a ticket.  However, the ticket reservation
   service is only available via a wide area cellular link of a specific
   provider.  While Oliver is downloading the news and accessing the
   train ticket reservation service, he receives a phone call over a
   wide area cellular link.  Oliver decides he wishes to initiate a
   video flow for this communication.  The bandwidth and traversal delay
   of the wide area cellular link is not adequate for the video
   conference, so both flows (video/audio) are transferred to the WLAN
   link provided by the hot-spot.  This transfer occurs transparently
   and without affecting any other active flows.

3.3.  Need to Set Up Preferences

   Nami works at home for a publishing company.  She has an in-house



Ernst, et al.            Expires April 27, 2006                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft      Goals and Benefits of Multihoming       October 2005


   network and get access to the Internet via ADSL, a public 802.11b
   WLAN from the street and satellite.  She has subscribed to the
   cheapest ADSL service with limited uplink bandwidth.  Also, the
   satellite link she has access to is downlink only, but it is
   extremely cheap for TV broadcasting.  She has noticed the 802.11b is
   unreliable at some point in time during the day, so she chooses to
   send requests and periodic refreshments for joining the TV
   broadcasting via ADSL rather than the 802.11b although 802.11b in the
   street is free.  On the other hand, she has configured her network to
   use the 802.11b link at night to publish web content comprising
   video.  Once a week, she communicates with overseas peer staff by
   videoconferencing.  Voice being the most important, she has
   configured her VoIP session over ADSL.  Video is sent at maximum rate
   when 802.11b is working fine, otherwise the video is sent at lower
   rate.

3.4.  Need for Reliability and Ubiquity

   Alice is a paramedic.  Her ambulance is called at the scene of a car
   accident.  She initiates a communication to a hospital via a wide
   area cellular link for the relay of low bit-rate live video from the
   site of the crash to assess the severity of the accident.  It is
   identified that one of the passengers has suffered a severe head
   injury.  The paramedic decides to consult a specialist via video
   conferencing.  This session is initiated from the specialist via the
   same wide area cellular link.  Meanwhile, the paramedic requests for
   the download of the patient medical records from the hospital
   servers.  The paramedic decides in mid-session that the wide area
   cellular link is too slow for this download and transfers the
   download to the ambulance satellite link.  Even though this link
   provides a significantly faster bit rate it has a longer traversal
   delay and only down-link is available.  For this, only the down-
   stream of the download is transferred while up-stream proceeds over
   the wide area cellular link.  Connectivity with the ambulance is
   managed over a WLAN link between the paramedic and the ambulance.
   Even though the paramedic has performed a partial hand-off for the
   transfer of the download down-stream to the satellite link, the
   upstream and the video conferencing session remains on the wide area
   cellular link.  This serves best the time constraint requirements of
   the real time communications.

3.5.  Need for Ubiquitous Access

   Max drives his car and constantly keeps some sort of Internet
   connectivity through one of the available access technologies.  His
   car navigator downloads road information from the Internet and his
   car-audio plays on-line audio streaming.  When his car passes an area
   where both high-data-rate WLAN and low-data-rate cellular network are

   available, it distributes load to the WLAN access and the cellular
   network access.  When his car passes an area where only a wide
   coverage-range cellular network is available, it maintains its
   connection via the cellular network.

3.6.  Need for Reliability

   Dr. Ingrid performs an operation via long-distance medical system.
   She watches a patient in a battle field over the screen which
   delivers real-time images of the patient.  Sensors on her arms
   deliver her operational actions and a robot performs the actual
   operation in the battle field.  Since the operation is critical, the
   delivery of patient images and Dr. Ingrid's action is done by bi-
   casting from/to multiple interfaces bound to a distinct technology or
   distinct radio range.  So in case packets are delayed or one of the
   interface fails to maintain connectivity to the network, her distant
   operation can be continued.

4.  Goals and Benefits of Multihoming

   We cannot really distinguish the goals from the benefits of
   multihoming, but there are several situations where it is either
   advisable or beneficial to be multihomed.  We use the scenarios
   presented in the previous section to highlight the goals and benefits
   of multihoming.  Figure 1 summarizes which goals apply to any of the
   scenario introduced in section Section 3.

   Figure 1: Goals Applying to Each Scenario

4.1.  Permanent and Ubiquitous Access

   To provide an extended coverage area via distinct access
   technologies.  Multiple interfaces bound to distinct technologies can
   be used to ensure a permanent connectivity is offered, anywhere,
   anytime, with anyone.

4.2.  Reliability

   To act upon failure at one point of attachment, i.e. the functions of
   a system component (e.g. interface, access network) are assumed by
   secondary system components when the primary component becomes
   unavailable (e.g. failure).  Connectivity is guaranteed as long as at
   least one connection to the Internet is maintained.

Internet-Draft      Goals and Benefits of Multihoming       October 2005


   A potential means is to duplicate a particular flow simultaneously
   through different routes.  This minimizes packet loss typically for
   real-time communication and burst traffic.  It also minimizes delay
   of packet delivery caused by congestion and achieves more reliable
   real-time communication than single-casting.  For mobile computing,
   bi-casting avoids dropping packets when a mobile node changes its
   interface during communication [6].

4.3.  Load Sharing

   To spread network traffic load among several routes.  This is
   achieved when traffic load is distributed among different connections
   between the node and the Internet [7].

4.4.  Load Balancing/Flow Distribution

   To separate a flow between multiple points of attachment
   (simultaneously active or not) of a node, usually chosing the less
   loaded connection or according to preferences on the mapping between
   flows and interfaces.

4.5.  Preference Settings

   This goal is to provide the user, the application or the ISP the
   ability to choose the preferred transmission technology or access
   network based on cost, efficiency, policies, bandwidth requirement,
   delay, etc.

4.6.  Aggregate Bandwidth

   This goal is to provide the user or the application with more
   bandwidth.  Bandwidth available to the user or the application may be
   limited by the underlying technology (e.g.  GSM has scarce bandwidth)
   or by some policies (e.g. monthly rate paid by the user).  Multiple
   interfaces connected to different links or ISPs can increase the
   total available bandwith.

5.  Classification

   From the definition of a multihomed node it follows that a multihomed
   node has several IPv6 addresses to choose between.  In order to
   expose the goals and benefits to manage multihomed nodes, we propose
   to distinguish two main cases: either the node has only one
   interface, or the node has several interfaces.  In the former case,
   the node is multihomed when multilpe prefixes are advertised.  This
   distinction is important and sometimes subtle but the implications
   are important.

5.1.  Case 1: One Interface, Multiple Prefixes

   The single-interfaced node is multihomed when several prefixes are
   advertised on its interface.  The node must therefore configure
   several IPv6 addresses.

   A typical example is a node with an IEEE 802.11 interface, connected
   to an access point.  The access point is connected trough an Ethernet
   link to two access routers.  Each access router is configured to send
   Router Advertisements on the link and can be used as default router.
   Several reasons may lead to configure two access routers are on the
   same link: for instance, the access points may be shared between
   different ISPs, or two access routers may be used for redundancy or
   load sharing purposes.  The node will then build two global IPv6
   addresses on its interface.

   We now analyse which of the goals detailed in Section 4 can be met
   with this configuration.


   o  Ubiquitous Access: MAYBE

      Ubiquitous access cannot be guaranteed when the node looses
      Internet connectivity through its sole interface (e.g. the node is
      going outside the coverage area of its access point).


   o  Reliability: MAYBE

      In case of failure of one IPv6 prefix, one of the address of the
      node will not be valid anymore.  Another available address built
      from other prefixes may allow the node to recover this sort of
      failure.

      Bi-casting can be performed to ensure the delivery of packets on
      the node.  To do so, more than one IPv6 address must be used
      simultaneously for one flow.  Bi-casting would allow the node to

Internet-Draft      Goals and Benefits of Multihoming       October 2005


      seamlessly change the address used on the node.


   o  Load sharing: YES

      Load Sharing can be performed in the network, according to the
      address used by the node.  The choice of the address used by the
      node and the router selection can be influenced by the load
      sharing rules.  This mostly benefits the network side: if
      different access routers or routes can be used to forward the
      node's traffic, it will share the traffic load on the network.


   o  Load balancing/Flow Distribution: NO

      Load balancing cannot be performed as the node has only one
      interface.


   o  Preferences: YES

      The source address can be chosen according to preferences set up
      by the user, or according to preferences set up in the network
      (such as with the default router preferences option introduced in
      Router Advertisement [8], or by the ISP.


   o  Aggregated Bandwidth: MAYBE

      With only one interface connected to a link, the node generally
      will not be able to benefit from an increased aggregated bandwidth
      with multiple prefixes.  However, this benefit might be gained
      indirectly.  For instance, by alternating between different
      addresses, the total throughput may be higher (eg. due to load
      sharing).  Also, some web and file transfer servers limit transfer
      bandwidths based on the client's address.  By using different
      addresses to connect to the same server, the node may also see an
      increase in file transfer rate.

5.2.  Case 2: Several Interfaces

   In this case, the node may use its multiple interfaces either
   alternatively or simultaneously.  If used simultaneously, the node
   uses several IPv6 addresses at the same time (at least one address
   per interface, or several if several prefixes are announced on the
   link(s) it is connected to).  If used alternatively, the node may
   switch between its interfaces (e.g, one at a time), which is the case
   described above in Section 5.1.  In the paragraphs below, we assume



Ernst, et al.            Expires April 27, 2006                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft      Goals and Benefits of Multihoming       October 2005


   that multiple interfaces are used simultaneously.  We also note that
   multiple interfaces can be connected to the same link as well as to
   different links.  These configurations will imply different issues.
   All these multihomed configurations may yield different benefits to
   the node.

   A typical example is a node with two interfaces, each one on a
   different technology (e.g. a WLAN IEEE 802.11b interface and a 3GPP
   GPRS interface), in order to benefit from a better coverage area and
   the characteristics of each technology.

   We now analyse how each of the goals listed in Section 4 can be met
   with such multihomed configuration:


   o  Ubiquitous Access: MAYBE

      It is easier to guarantee ubiquitous access when the node has
      multiple interfaces since distinct technologies may be available
      at a given time according to the location and administrative
      policies.


   o  Reliability: YES

      Two levels of redundancy can be seen in this case: either one
      address of one interface is not valid anymore (e.g. because the
      corresponding prefix is not advertised on the link), or the node
      loses its internet connectivity through one interface.  In the
      former case, another IPv6 address available on the interface would
      allow the node to switch addresses for on-going flows.  In the
      latter case, another connection to the internet through another
      interface would allow it to redirect on-going flow from the
      previous interface to the new one.  In either cases the node needs
      to change the IPv6 address for on-going sessions from the no
      longer valid address to one of the address available on the target
      interface.  The redirection will trigger a decision process to
      choose the best target interface to redirect the flow to.

      Bi-casting might be used to ensure the packets delivery on the
      node.  It would also allow seamless redirection between two
      addresses / interfaces with zero packets loss.  Bi-casting can be
      performed if several IPv6 addresses can be simultaneously used for
      one flow.  One entity between the CN (included) and the node
      (excluded) must duplicate the traffic to the destination node.

Internet-Draft      Goals and Benefits of Multihoming       October 2005


   o  Load Sharing: YES

      This benefit is mainly for the network side: if different access
      routers or routes can be used to forward traffic going into and
      out of the node, they can share the traffic load on the network.
      If the node uses several addresses at the same time for its on-
      going sessions, load sharing can be performed in the network.
      This goal can be a parameter that helps the source address
      selection.


   o  Load balancing/Flow Distribution: YES

      Load balancing can be achieved on the node if several interfaces
      are used simultaneously.  Several interfaces can be used to spread
      the traffic load on the node.  This implies the choice of the IPv6
      address to use for each flow and the ability to choose a different
      address for each flow.


   o  Preferences: YES

      Interface and address selection is required.  The problem can be
      seen exactly as in the first case (the node has only one
      interface) if we consider that the interface preference is a
      parameter for the address selection.  Therefore in this case, the
      interface selection/preference is a supplementary parameter in the
      address selection algorithm.


   o  Aggregated Bandwidth: YES

      With multiple interfaces connected to a link, the node generally
      will be able to benefit from an increased aggregated bandwidth.

6.  Issues

   will have to be solved in order to meet the multihoming goals.

   Figure 2: Issues and their Importance for Each Case

6.1.  Source Address Selection

   The multihomed node has several addresses.  The appropriate address
   must be chosen when an IPv6 communication is established (e.g. when a
   TCP connection is opened).  This choice can be influenced by many
   parameters: user preferences, ingress filtering, preference flag in
   Router Advertisement, destination prefix, type of interface, link
   characteristics, etc.  An address selection mechanism is needed for
   this.

6.2.  Recovery Delay

   The time needed for detecting an address has become invalid and the
   time to redirect communications to one of its other addresses is
   considered as critical.

   However, transport sessions with multihoming capabilies such as SCTP
   may be able to continue easily since SCTP has built-in transmission

   rate control mechanims to take into account the differences between
   two paths.

6.3.  Change of Traffic Characteristics

   The change of path for a specific session (e.g. due to change of
   interface) may cause changes on the end-to-end path characteristics
   (higher delay, different PMTU, etc).  This could have an impact on
   upper layer protocols such as transport protocols (particularly TCP)
   or applications that are sensitive to changes.

6.4.  Address Change

   In some situations, it will be necessary to divert some or all of the
   sessions from one interface or prefix to another (e.g. due to loss of
   network connection or the access router becoming unreachable - this
   could be particularly frequent for mobile nodes).  With no support
   mechanism, an address change would cause on-going sessions using the
   invalid former address to terminate, and to be restarted using the
   new address.  To avoid this, the node needs a recovery mechanism
   allowing to redirect all current communication to one of its other
   IPv6 addresses.

   In the case of a mobile node changing its point of attachment using
   the same interface, all flows must be redirected to the new location
   in order to maintain sessions.  A mobility management solution may be
   required, such as Mobile IPv6 [9] for mobile hosts or NEMO Basic
   Support [10] for mobile routers.  Additional mechanisms may be needed
   if the node was using several addresses on its old link, such as
   which flow to redirect, which address must be associated with the new
   address(es).  The scalability of the operations involved in the
   redirection of flows may also be an issue, if we consider that the
   node had several addresses on the old link and several flows and/or
   correspondents.  Issues pertaining to Mobile IPv6 and NEMO Basic
   Support are explained in companion drafts [2] and [3] respectively.

7.  Conclusion

   In this document we show the concrete need for multihoming at the
   level of the end node.  We emphasized the needs and goals of having
   multiple interfaces at the communicating end node.  Such interfaces
   could be used as one as the replacement of the other (ubiquitous
   access to the Internet, reliability) or simultaneously (load sharing,
   load balancing/flow distribution, preference settings or aggregate
   bandwidth).

   Such goals are motivated for fixed nodes and mobile nodes, but the
   need prevail for mobile nodes (hosts and routers).  Goals can only be
   met once some issues are solved.  Issues specific to mobile hosts and
   mobile routers are investigated in documents of the MONAMI6 and NEMO
   working groups at the IETF.
