                 PCEP Extension for Flow Specification
                     draft-li-pce-pcep-flowspec-00

Abstract

   Dissemination of the traffic flow specifications was first introduced
   in the BGP protocol via RFC 5575.  In order to distribute the flow
   specifications from PCE controller to network device without BGP
   protocol it is desirable to extend PCEP with flow specification
   information.

   This document specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to support
   dissemination of flow specifications.  The extensions include the
   instantiation, updation and deletion of flow specifications.

1.  Introduction

   Dissemination of the traffic flow specifications was first introduced
   in the BGP protocol [RFC5575].  The traffic flow specification is
   comprised of traffic filtering rules and actions.  The routers which
   received the flow specification can take advantage of the ACL (Access
   Control List) or firewall capabilities in the router's forwarding
   path.  The routers can classify the packets according to the traffic

   filtering rules and shape, rate limit, filter, or redirect packets
   based on the actions.  The flow specification carried by BGP can be
   used to automate inter-domain coordination of traffic filtering to
   mitigate (distributed) denial-of-service attacks and can also be used
   to provide traffic filtering in the context of a BGP/MPLS VPN
   service.

   [RFC5575] also defines that a flow specification received from an
   external autonomous system will need to be validated against unicast
   routing before being accepted.  [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-flowspec-oid]
   describes a modification to the validation procedure defined in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-flowspec-oid] for the dissemination of BGP flow
   specifications.  The modification proposed enables flow
   specifications to be originated from a centralized BGP route
   controller.

   [I-D.ietf-ospf-flowspec-extensions] defines the extensions to OSPF to
   distribute flow specifications in the networks that only deploy an
   IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol) (e.g., OSPF).  It also defines the
   validation procedures for imposing the filtering information on the
   routers.

   [RFC5440] describes the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP).
   PCEP defines the communication between a Path Computation Client
   (PCC) and a Path Control Element (PCE), or between PCE and PCE,
   enabling computation of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) for
   Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path (TE LSP) characteristics.

   Stateful pce [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] specifies a set of
   extensions to PCEP to enable stateful control of TE LSPs between and
   across PCEP sessions in compliance with [RFC4657].  It includes
   mechanisms to effect LSP state synchronization between PCCs and PCEs,
   delegation of control of LSPs to PCEs, and PCE control of timing and
   sequence of path computations within and across PCEP sessions and
   focuses on a model where LSPs are configured on the PCC and control
   over them is delegated to the PCE.  [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp]
   describes the setup, maintenance and teardown of PCE- initiated LSPs
   under the stateful PCE model, without the need for local
   configuration on the PCC, thus allowing for a dynamic network that is
   centrally controlled and deployed.

   In case PCE is used to initiate tunnels via PCEP, it is desirable to
   use the same protocol to also distribute the flow specifications to
   describe what data flows on those tunnels.  Thus, in order to
   distribute the flow specifications from PCE controller to network
   device, PCEP is extended with flow specification information in this
   document.

Internet-Draft                PCEP-FlowSpec                February 2016


   This document specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to support
   dissemination of flow specifications.  The flow specifications can be
   disseminated between PCEP peers such as from PCE to PCC or between
   PCEs . The extensions include the creation, updation and withdrawal
   of flow specifications via PCEP.

   The values of flow filtering rules and actions mainly refer to the
   BGP flow specification and IGP specification.  This document extends
   new actions which are redirecting to LSP (refered by Symbolic Path
   Name, IPv4 LSP, or IPv6 LSP).

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terms defined in [RFC5440] and [RFC5575].

   This document uses the terms defined in [RFC5440]: PCC, PCE, PCEP
   Peer.

   The following term is from [RFC5575].  It is used frequently
   throughout this document:

   Flow Specification (FlowSpec): A flow specification is an n-tuple
   consisting of several matching criteria that can be applied to IP
   traffic, including filters and actions.  Each FlowSpec consists of a
   set of filters and a set of actions.

3.  Procedures for Dissemination of FlowSpec

3.1.  Overview of Procedures

   A PCC or PCE indicates its ability to support PCE FlowSpec during the
   PCEP Initialization Phase via "PCE FlowSpec Capability" TLV (see
   details in Section 5.1.1).

   This section introduces the procedure to support PCE FlowSpec as
   follows:

   Firstly both the PCE and PCC advertise the PCE FlowSpec Capability
   during the PCE session initiation phase.

   On the PCEP session with PCE FlowSpec Capability PCE communicates
   with PCC to create, update and withdraw PCE FlowSpec.

   [Editor's Note - The procedure about PCE FlowSpec synchronization,
   the session failure process, etc. will be specified in the future
   version.]

Internet-Draft                PCEP-FlowSpec                February 2016


3.2.  Capability Advertisement

   During PCEP session establishment, both the PCC and the PCE must
   announce their support of PCEP extensions for FlowSpec defined in
   this document.

   A PCEP Speaker (PCE or PCC) includes the "PCE FlowSpec Capability"
   TLV, described in Section 5.1.1, in the OPEN Object to advertise its
   support for PCEP extensions for PCE FlowSpec Capability.

   The presence of the PCE FlowSpec Capability TLV in PCE's OPEN message
   indicates that the PCE can support distribute the FlowSpec to PCC.

   The presence of such Capability TLV in PCC's OPEN Object indicates
   that the PCC can be in support of Flowspec functionality to
   instantiate the FlowSpec according to the PCE's indication and can
   apply the FlowSpec to the incoming packets.

   If PCE has such capability TLV and PCC has no such capability TLV PCE
   MUST NOT send the PCE messages with FlowSpec information.  And if PCC
   receives such messages it should send PCErr message to PCE.

   [Editor's Note - PCE discovery via IGP should also be extended for
   this.]

3.3.  Operations

   To instantiate a FlowSpec which is comprised of a set of FlowSpec
   filter rules and actions, the PCE sends a new PCEP message (called
   FlowSpec message) to the PCC.  The FlowSpec message MUST include the
   SRP object[I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce], a new FLOW object (see details
   in Section 5.2) and a new ACTION object (see details in Section 5.3).
   FLOW object carries a set of FlowSpec filter rules.  A list of ACTION
   objects specify a set of FlowSpec actions.

   To update the FlowSpec actions of a specified FlowSpec which has been
   created, the same PCEP message "FlowSpec" is used.  The PCE sends a
   FlowSpec message to the PCC.  The FlowSpec message MUST include the
   SRP object, FLOW object and ACTION object.

   To delete the specified FlowSpec which has been created, the PCE
   sends a FlowSpec message to the PCC with a flag indicating the
   removal action.  The FlowSpec message MUST include the SRP object
   (with R flag set) and FLOW object.

4.  PCEP Messages

   As defined in [RFC5440], a PCEP message consists of a common header
   followed by a variable-length body made of a set of objects that can
   be either mandatory or optional.  An object is said to be mandatory
   in a PCEP message when the object must be included for the message to
   be considered valid.  For each PCEP message type, a set of rules is
   defined that specify the set of objects that the message can carry.
   An implementation MUST form the PCEP messages using the object
   ordering specified in this document.

   To support the PCEP FlowSpec functionality one new PCEP messages is
   introduced.

4.1.  PCEP FlowSpec Message

   A FlowSpec message which is also referred to as FlowSpec message is a
   PCEP message sent by a PCE to a PCC to trigger creation, modification
   or deletion of a FlowSpec.

   The Message-Type field of the PCEP common header for the FlowSpec
   message is to be assigned by IANA.  The FlowSpec message MUST include
   the SRP and the FLOW objects.

   If FlowSpec message is used to create or update the FlowSpec, it MUST
   include the ACTION objects too.

   If FlowSpec message is used to delete the FlowSpec the ACTION objects
   SHOULD NOT be carried and the SRP object is set with the R flag.

   A FlowSpec is identified by a PCEP specific identifier FS-ID.

   The format of a FlowSpec message for creation or deletion of FlowSpec
   is as follows:

      <FlowSpec Message> ::= <Common Header>
                            <flowspec-list>
   Where:
      <flowspec-list> ::= <flowspec-request>[<flowspec-list>]

      <flowspec-request>::= (<flowspec-create-or-update>|
                             <flowspec-delete>)

      <flowspec-create-or-update> ::= <SRP>
                                      <FLOW>
                                      <action-list>

      <flowspec-delete> ::= <SRP>
                             <FLOW>

   Where:
       <action-list>::=<ACTION>[<action-list>]

   The SRP object defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] can be used in
   this document to correlate FlowSpec requests sent by the PCE with the
   error reports sent by the PCC.

   Every FlowSpec requests from the PCE sends a new SRP-ID-NUMBER as
   described in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce].  This number is unique per
   PCEP session and is incremented each time an FlowSpec operation
   (creation, update, deletion etc) is requested from the PCE.  The
   value of the SRP-ID-NUMBER MAY be echoed back by the PCC in PCErr
   messages to allow for correlation between requests made by the PCE
   and errors generated by the PCC.  Procedure of dissemination of
   FlowSpec from PCE share the same number space of the SRP-ID-NUMBER
   with procedure of stateful PCE.

   The FLOW and ACTION objects are new objects introduced in this
   document.

5.  Objects and TLVs

   The PCEP objects defined in this document are compliant with the PCEP
   object format defined in [RFC5440].

   New TLVs about FlowSpec filtering rules are defined.  The value
   portion of the new TLVs can reuse the structure defined in [RFC5575]
   and [I-D.ietf-idr-flow-spec-v6].  New TLVs about FlowSpec actions are
   also defined.  The value portion of the new TLVs can reuse the
   structure defined in [I-D.ietf-ospf-flowspec-extensions].  This
   document also defines two new actions: Redirect to IPv4 LSP and
   Redirect to IPv6 LSP.

5.1.  OPEN Object

5.1.1.  PCE FlowSpec Capability TLV

   The PCE-FLOWSPEC-CAPABILITY TLV is an optional TLV associated with
   the OPEN Object [RFC5440] to exchange PCE FlowSpec capability of PCEP
   speakers.

   Its format is shown in the following figure:

      0                   1                   2                   3

     +---------------------------------------------------------------+
              Figure 1: PCE-FLOWSPEC-CAPABILITY TLV format

   The type of the TLV is to be assigned by IANA and it has a fixed
   length of 2 octets.  The value field is set to default value 0.

   The inclusion of this TLV in an OPEN object indicate that the sender
   can perform FlowSpec handling in PCEP.

5.2.  FLOW Object

   The FLOW object MUST be present within FlowSpec messages.  The FLOW
   object carries a set of FlowSpec filter rules.

   FLOW Object-Class is to be assigned by IANA.

   Two FLOW Object-Type are defined so far:

   o  IPv4 FLOW: FLOW Object-Type is 1.

   o  IPv6 FLOW: FLOW Object-Type is 2.

   The format of the FLOW object is as follows:

   FS-ID(32-bit): A PCEP-specific identifier for the FlowSpec
   information.  A PCE creates an unique FS-ID for each FlowSpec that is
   constant for the lifetime of a PCEP session.  All subsequent PCEP
   messages then address the FlowSpec by the FS-ID.  The values of 0 and
   0xFFFFFFFF are reserved.

   Flow Filter TLVs(variable): The FLOW object body has a variable
   length and may contain one or more additional TLVs.

   The following flow filter types are supported:

   The ACTION object MUST be present within FlowSpec messages when
   creating or updating the FlowSpec.  The ACTION object carries a set
   of FlowSpec actions.

   ACTION Object-Class is to be assigned by IANA.

   ACTION Object-Type is 1.

Appendix B.  Example Usage

   Once PCE initiate tunnels, it needs to further decide what data needs
   to flow on the newly created tunnel, a flow specification can be
   created at the ingress to redirect the flow to the LSP as shown
   below.
