Internet-Draft          SeND Hash Threat Analysis              July 2008


Abstract

   This document analysis the use of hashes in SeND, possible threats
   and the impact of recent attacks on hash functions used by SeND.
   Current SeND specification [rfc3971] uses SHA-1 [sha-1] hash
   algorithm and PKIX certificates [rfc3280] and does not provide
   support for the hash algorithm agility.  Based on previous analysis,
   this document suggests multiple hash support that should be included
   in the SeND update specification.

1.  Introduction

   SEND [rfc3971] uses the SHA-1 hash algorithm to generate the contents
   of the Key Hash and the Digital Signature fields of the RSA
   signature.  It also uses a hash algorithm (SHA-1,MD5 etc.) in the
   PKIX certificates [rfc3280] used for router authorization.  Recently
   there have been demonstrated attacks against the collision free
   property of such hash functions [sha1-coll].  There have also been
   attacks on the PKIX X.509 certificates that use the MD5 hash
   algorithm [x509-coll] that allow an attacker to generate two
   different certificates with different distinguished names and
   different public keys that contain identical signatures.  This
   document analyzes the effects of such attacks on the SEND protocol
   and proposes changes to make it resistant to such attacks.

3.  Impact of collision attacks on SeND

   Due to the collision attacks demonstrated on the aforesaid hash
   algorithms a study was performed to assess the threat of these
   attacks on the cryptographic hash usage in internet protocols
   [RFC4270].  This document analyzes the hash usage in SEND following
   the approach recommended by [rfc4270].  Following the approach
   recommended by [rfc4270] and [new-hashes], we will analyze the impact
   of these attacks on SeND case by case in this section.  Through our
   analysis, whether we should support hash agility on SeND is also
   discussed.

   Up to date, all demonstrated attacks are attacks against a collision-
   free property.  Attacks against the one-way property are not yet
   feasible [rfc4270].

3.1.  Attacks against CGAs in stateless autoconfiguration

   Hash functions are used in the stateless autoconfiguration process
   that is based on CGAs.  Impacts of collision attacks on current uses
   of CGAs are analyzed in the update of CGA specification [rfc4982],
   which also enables CGAs to support hash agility.  CGAs provide proof-
   of-ownership of the private key corresponding to the public key used
   to generate CGA, and they don't deal with the non-repudiation
   feature, while collision attacks are mainly about affecting non-
   repudiation feature.  While SeND is CGA based protocol, we are sure
   that the node that signs the message is the same as the node that
   creates the message and associated hash.  So, as [rfc4982] points out
   CGA based protocols, including SeND, are not affected by the recent
   collision attacks.

3.2.  Attacks against PKIX certificates in ADD process

   The second use of hash functions is for router authorization in ADD
   process.  Router sends to host a certification path, which is a path
   between a router and hosts's trust anchor and consists of PKIX
   certificates.  Researchers demonstrated attacks against PKIX
   certificates with MD5 signature, in 2005 [new-hashes] and in 2007
   [X509-COLL].

   In 2005 they succeeded to construct the original and the false
   certificate that had the same identity data and digital signature,
   but different public keys [new-hashes].  The problem for the attacker
   is that two certificates with the same identity are not very useful
   in real-world scenarios, while Certification Authority is not allowed
   to provide such two certificates.  Additionally, since identity field
   is humane readable data, certificates are not affected by collision
   attacks in practice.  Implementations SHOULD use human-readable

Internet-Draft          SeND Hash Threat Analysis              July 2008


   certificate extensions only if SeND certificate profile demands.  We
   also have to take into account that attacker could produce such false
   certificate only if he could predict context- useful certificate
   data.  So, although collision attacks against PKIX certificates are
   theoretically possible, they can hardly be performed in practice.

   In 2007 were demonstrated certificates with the same identity data
   and signatures, which differed only in public keys.  Such attacks are
   potentially more dangerous, since attacker can decide about contents
   of human readable fields, and produce for example certificates with
   the same signatures, but different identities or validity periods.
   However, in order to perform a real-world useful attack, attacker
   still needs to predict the content of all fields appearing before the
   public key, eg. serial number or validity periods.  Although a
   relying party cannot verify the content of these fields (each
   certificate by itself is unsuspicious), the CA keeps track of those
   fields and during the fraud analysis, the false certificate can be
   revealed.

   Generally, the most dangerous are attacks against middle-certificates
   in the certification path, where for the cost of one false
   certificate, attacker launches attack on multiple routers.  In such
   scenarios, we will be at least safe from attacks against Trust
   Anchor's certificate because it is not exchanged in SeND messages.
   Additionally, if attacker, for example, manages to produce a false
   certificate with changed IP prefixes in IP subjectAltName extension
   (which is currently just theoretically possible), IP prefixes range
   will be broadened at maximum to the range from the Trust Anchor's
   certificate.

3.3.  Attacks against Digital Signature in RSA Signature option

   Digital signature in RSA Signature option is produced as the SHA-1
   hash of IPv6 addresses, ICMPv6 header, ND message and other fields
   like Message Type Tag and ND options [rfc3971], and is signed with
   the sender's private key, which corresponds to the public key from
   the CGA parameters structure and is authorized usually through CGAs.
   The possible attack on such explicit digital signature is typical
   non-repudiation attack.  Attacker could generate a false message with
   the same hash and sign that false hashed message with authorized
   private key.  However, the problem for the attacker is that they are
   very hard to predict the useful input data.  It minimizes the
   possibility for a real-world collision attack and the fact that in
   order to perform a succesful real-world attack he can not change a
   human-readable data.  But we also have to take into account that a
   variant of SHA-1 was already affected by recent collision attacks and
   we have to prepare for future improved attacks.

Internet-Draft          SeND Hash Threat Analysis              July 2008


3.4.  Attacks against Key Hash in RSA Signature option

   Key Hash field in the RSA Signature option is a SHA-1 hash of the
   public key from the CGA parameters structure in the CGA option of
   SeND message.  Key Hash field is a typical example of data
   fingerprinting, which is potentially dangerous because input field is
   a non human-readable data.  But the problem for the attacker is that
   a public key, which is input data is authorized through CGAs, and
   sometimes additionally through a certification path if peer has
   configured trust anchor.  For the succesful attack, attacker has to
   break both SHA-1 hashed public key, as well as corresponding CGA and
   possibly a certification path.  Otherwise, changed key pair will be
   detected in the process of CGA verification.  The same as in previous
   cases, this attack is theoretically possible, but very hard to
   perform in practice.

4.  Support for the hash agility in SeND

   While all of analyzed hash functions in SeND are theoretically
   affected by recent collision attacks, these attacks indicate the
   possibility of future real-world attacks.  In order to increase the
   future security of SeND, we suggest the support for the hash and
   algorithm agility in SeND.

   The most effective and secure would be to bind the hash function
   option with something that can not be changed at all, like [rfc4982]
   does for CGA - encoding the hash function information into addresses.
   But, there is no possibilty to do that in SeND.  We could decide to
   use by default the same hash function in SeND as in CGA, but this
   solution is architecturally strange and it does not really increase
   the security since the difficulty for attackers remain to break one
   single hash function.  Furthermore, it may even reduce the security
   level by providing more relevant information of the hash function.
   On the other side, the use of two different hash algorithms makes
   attacker's life harder.

   Another solution is to incorporate the hash function option into SeND
   message.  By putting a new hash function option in SeND message
   before RSA Signature option, attacker will have to break both the
   signature and the hash input at the same time since the new option
   will be input field for the Digital Signature in RSA Signature
   option.  However, we can not avoid a downgrade attack totally because
   peer might be using just ND and not SeND.  A completely safe solution
   here does not exist.  A new hash function option in SeND message is a
   reasonable and the best solution for the hash algorithm agility
   support in SeND.

   Each implementation SHOULD use different hash or signature algorithms
   for each of the relevant fields (Key Hash field, Digital Signature,
   PKIX signature algorithm).  Since all algorithms are in different
   procedures, making them the same does not make those procedures
   simpler, but making them different complicates possible attacks.

4.1.  Hash algorithm option

   In order to provide hash algorithm agility, each SeND implemenation
   MUST support the Hash algorithm option.  The Hash algorithm option
   defines:

   o  a hash algorithm that MUST be used for producing the RSA Signature
      option (Key Hash field) - HA-KH,

   o  a hash algorithm that MUST be used for producing the RSA Signature
      option (Digital Signature field) - HA-DS,

Internet-Draft          SeND Hash Threat Analysis              July 2008


   o  a PKIX signature algorithm that the sender of the Hash algorithm
      option is ready to accept and validate.  In order to enhance
      interoperability, implementations SHOULD also accept and validate
      PKIX certificates with a signature algorithm that has the higher
      encoding number than requested signature algorithm.
      Implementations MUST NOT accept PKIX certificates with signature
      algorithms marked with lower encoding.
