                IS-IS Extensions for Flow Specification
                 draft-you-isis-flowspec-extensions-01

Abstract

   Dissemination of the Traffic flow information was first introduced in
   the BGP protocol [RFC5575].  FlowSpec routes are used to distribute
   traffic filtering rules that are used to filter Denial-of-Service
   (DoS) attacks.  For the networks that only deploy an IGP (Interior
   Gateway Protocol) (e.g., IS-IS), it is required that the IGP is
   extended to distribute Flow Specification or FlowSpec routes.

   This document discusses the use cases for distributing flow
   specification (FlowSpec) routes using IS-IS.  Furthermore, this
   document defines a new IS-IS FlowSpec Reachability TLV encoding
   format that can be used to distribute FlowSpec routes, its validation
   procedures for imposing the filtering information on the routers, and
   a capability to indicate the support of FlowSpec functionality.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5575] defines Border Gateway Protocol protocol extensions that
   can be used to distribute traffic flow specifications.  One
   application of this encoding format is to automate inter-domain
   coordination of traffic filtering, such as what is required in order
   to mitigate (distributed) denial-of-service attacks.  [RFC5575]
   allows flow specifications received from an external autonomous
   system to be forwarded to a given BGP peer.  However, in order to
   block the attack traffic more effectively, it is better to distribute
   the BGP FlowSpec routes to the customer network, which is much closer
   to the attacker.

   For the networks deploying only an IGP (e.g., IS-IS), it is expected
   to extend the IGP (IS-IS in this document) to distribute FlowSpec
   routes.  This document discusses the use cases for distributing
   FlowSpec routes using IS-IS.  Furthermore, this document also defines
   a new IS-IS FlowSpec Reachability TLV encoding format that can be
   used to distribute FlowSpec routes to the edge routers in the
   customer network, its validation procedures for imposing the
   filtering information on the routers, and a capability to indicate
   the support of Flowspec functionality.

   The semantic content of the FlowSpec extensions defined in this
   document are identical to the corresponding extensions to BGP
   ([RFC5575] and [I-D.ietf-idr-flow-spec-v6]).  In order to avoid
   repetition, this document only concentrates on those parts of
   specification where IS-IS is different from BGP.  The IS-IS flowspec
   extensions defined in this document can be used to mitigate the
   impacts of DoS attacks.

2.  Terminology

   This section contains definitions for terms used frequently
   throughout this document.  However, many additional definitions can
   be found in [ISO-10589] and [RFC5575].

      Flow Specification (FlowSpec): A flow specification is an n-tuple
      consisting of several matching criteria that can be applied to IP
      traffic, including filters and actions.  Each FlowSpec consists of
      a set of filters and a set of actions.

3.  Use Cases for IS-IS based FlowSpec Distribution

   For the networks deploying only an IGP (e.g., IS-IS), it is expected
   to extend the IGP (IS-IS in this document) to distribute FlowSpec
   routes, because when the FlowSpec routes are installed in the
   customer network, they are closer to the attacker than when they are
   installed in the provider network.  Consequently, the attack traffic
   could be blocked or the suspicious traffic could be limited to a low
   rate as early as possible.

   The following sub-sections discuss the use cases for IS-IS based
   FlowSpec route distribution.

3.1.  IS-IS Campus Network

   For networks not deploying BGP, for example, the campus network using
   IS-IS, it is expected to extend IS-IS to distribute FlowSpec routes
   as shown in Figure 1.  In this kind of network, the traffic analyzer
   could be deployed with a router, then the FlowSpec routes from the
   traffic analyzer need to be distributed to the other routers in this
   domain using IS-IS.

                  |                     |                  |

3.2.  BGP/MPLS VPN

   [RFC5575] defines a BGP NLRI encoding format to distribute traffic
   flow specifications in BGP deployed network.  However, in the BGP/
   MPLS VPN scenario, the IGP (e.g., IS-IS or OSPF) is used between the
   PE (Provider Edge) and CE (Customer Edge) in many deployments.  In
   order to distribute the FlowSpec routes to the customer network, the
   IGP needs to support FlowSpec route distribution.  The FlowSpec

   routes are usually generated by the traffic analyzer or the traffic
   policy center in the network.  Depending on the location of the
   traffic analyzer deployment, two different distribution scenarios are
   discussed below.

3.2.1.  Traffic Analyzer Deployed in Provider Network

   The traffic analyzer (also acting as the traffic policy center) could
   be deployed in the provider network as shown in Figure 2.  If the
   traffic analyzer detects attack traffic from the customer network
   VPN1, it would generate the FlowSpec routes for preventing DoS
   attacks.  FlowSpec routes with a Route Distinguisher (RD) in the
   Network Layer Reachability information (NRLI) corresponding to VPN1
   are distributed from the traffic analyzer to the PE1 to which the
   traffic analyzer is attached.  If the traffic analyzer is also a BGP
   speaker, it can distribute the FlowSpec routes using BGP [RFC5575].
   Then the PE1 distributes the FlowSpec routes further to the PE2.
   Finally, the FlowSpec routes need to be distributed from PE2 to the
   CE2 using IS-IS, i.e., to the customer network VPN1.  As an attacker
   is more likely in the customer network, FlowSpec routes installed
   directly on CE2 could mitigate the impact of DoS attacks better.

3.2.2.  Traffic Analyzer Deployed in Customer Network

   The traffic analyzer (also acting as the traffic policy center) could
   be deployed in the customer network as shown in Figure 3.  If the
   traffic analyzer detects attack traffic, it would generate FlowSpec
   routes to prevent associated DoS attacks.  Then the FlowSpec routes
   would be distributed from the traffic analyzer to the CE1 using IS-IS
   or another policy protocol (e.g., RESTful API over HTTP).
   Furthermore, the FlowSpec routes need to be distributed throughout
   the provider network via PE1/PE2 to CE2, i.e., to the remote customer
   network VPN1 Site1.  If the FlowSpec routes installed on the CE2, it
   could block the attack traffic as close to the source of the attack
   as possible.

3.2.3.  Policy Configuration

   The CE or PE could deploy local filtering policies to filter IS-IS
   FlowSpec rules, for example, deploying a filtering policy to filter
   the incoming IS-IS FlowSpec rules in order to prevent illegal or
   invalid FlowSpec rules from being applied.

   The PE should configure FlowSpec importing policies to control
   importing action between the BGP IP/VPN FlowSpec RIB and the IS-IS
   Instance FlowSpec RIB.  Otherwise, the PE couldn't transform a BGP

   IP/VPN FlowSpec rule to an IS-IS FlowSpec rule or transform an IS-IS
   FlowSpec rule to a BGP IP/VPN FlowSpec rule.

4.  IS-IS Extensions for FlowSpec Routes

   This document defines a new IS-IS TLV, i.e. the FlowSpec reachability
   TLV (TLV type: TBD1), which would be carried in an LSP (Link State
   Protocol) Data Unit [ISO-10589], to describe the FlowSpec routes.

   The FlowSpec Reachability TLV carries one or more FlowSpec entries.
   Each FlowSpec entry consists of FlowSpec filters (FlowSpec filters
   sub-TLVs) and corresponding FlowSpec actions (FlowSpec Action sub-
   TLVs).

   The FlowSpec Reachability TLV is defined below in Figure 4:

      0                   1                   2                   3

      Type: 1 octet.  Type code is TBD1.

      Length: 1 octet.  The length field defines the length of the value
      portion in octets (thus a TLV with no value portion would have a
      length of 0).

      Value: variable.  The value field contains a "Flags" field and one
      or more 2-tuples consisting of the Length and the FlowSpec entry.
      Each 2-tuple starts with 1 octet of Length, and followed by a
      variable length FlowSpec entry, which consists of FlowSpec filters
      sub-TLVs and corresponding FlowSpec action sub-TLVs.  The length

      The least significant bit L is defined as a Leaking enable bit.
      If set, the FlowSpec Reachability TLV SHOULD be flooded across the
      entire routing domain.  If the L flag is not set, the FlowSpec
      Reachability TLV MUST NOT be leaked between levels.  This bit MUST
      NOT be altered during the TLV leaking.  This Flags may be modified
      by the IS-IS Speaker according to a local policy.

4.1.  FlowSpec Filters sub-TLV

   IS-IS FlowSpec filters sub-TLV is one component of FlowSpec entry,
   carried in the FlowSpec reachability TLV.  It is defined below in

4.1.1.  Order of Traffic Filtering Rules

   With traffic filtering rules, more than one rule may match a
   particular traffic flow.  The order of applying the traffic filter
   rules is the same as described in Section 5.1 of [RFC5575] and in
   Section 3.1 of [I-D.ietf-idr-flow-spec-v6].

4.1.2.  Validation Procedure

   [RFC5575] defines a validation procedure for BGP FlowSpec rules, and
   [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-flowspec-oid] describes a modification to the
   validation procedure defined in [RFC5575] for the dissemination of
   BGP flow specifications.  The IS-IS FlowSpec should support similar
   features to mitigate the unnecessary application of traffic filter
   rules.  The IS-IS FlowSpec validation procedure is described as
   follows.

   When a router receives a FlowSpec rule including a destination prefix
   filter from its neighbor router, it should consider the prefix filter
   as a valid filter unless the S bit in the flags field of Filter TLV
   is set.  If the S bit is set, then the FlowSpec rule is considered
   valid if and only if:

      The originator of the FlowSpec rule matches the originator of the
      best-match unicast route for the destination prefix embedded in
      the FlowSpec.

   The former rule allows any centralized controller to originate the
   prefix filter and advertise it within a given IS-IS network.  The
   latter rule, also known as a Strict Validation rule, allows strict
   checking and enforces that the originator of the FlowSpec filter is
   also the originator of the destination prefix.

   When multiple equal-cost paths exist in the routing table entry, each
   path could end up having a separate set of FlowSpec rules.

   When a router receives a FlowSpec rule not including a destination
   prefix filter from its neighbor router, the validation procedure
   described above is not applicable.

   The FlowSpec filter validation state is used by an IS-IS speaker when
   the filter is considered for an installation in its FIB.  An IS-IS
   speaker MUST flood IS-IS LSP containing a FlowSpec Reachability TLV
   as per the rules defined in [ISO-10589] regardless of the validation
   state of the prefix filters.

4.2.  FlowSpec Action sub-TLV

   There are one or more FlowSpec Action TLVs associated with a FlowSpec
   Filters TLV.  Different FlowSpec Filters TLV could have the same
   FlowSpec Action TLVs.  The following IS-IS FlowSpec action TLVs,
   except Redirect, are same as defined in [RFC5575].

   Redirect: IPv4 or IPv6 address.  This IP address may correspond to a
   tunnel, i.e., the redirect allows the traffic to be redirected to a
   directly attached next-hop or a next-hop requiring a route lookup.

5.  Redistribution of FlowSpec Routes

   In certain scenarios, FlowSpec routes MAY get redistributed from one
   protocol domain to another; specifically from BGP to IS-IS and vice-
   versa.  When redistributed from BGP, the IS-IS speaker SHOULD

Internet-Draft                ISIS FlowSpec                    June 2015


   generate a FlowSpec Reachability TLV for the redistributed routes and
   announce it within an IS-IS domain.  An implementation MAY provide an
   option for an IS-IS speaker to announce a redistributed FlowSpec
   route within an IS-IS domain regardless of being installed in its
   local FIB.  An implementation MAY impose an upper bound on number of
   FlowSpec routes that an IS-IS router MAY advertise.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines the following new IS-IS TLV types, which need
   to be reflected in the IS-IS TLV codepoint registry.

6.1.  FlowSpec reachability TLV

       | TBD3   |     sub-TLV           |       [RFC5575]          |
       |        |                       |I-D.ietf-idr-flow-spec-v6 |
       +--------+-----------------------+--------------------------+

6.3.  FlowSpec Action sub-TLV

   This document defines a group of FlowSpec actions.  The following TLV
   types need to be assigned:

      Type TBD4 - traffic-rate
      Type TBD5 - traffic-action
      Type TBD6 - traffic-marking
      Type TBD7 - redirect to IPv4
      Type TBD8 - redirect to IPv6

7.  Security considerations

   This extension to IS-IS does not change the underlying security
   issues inherent in the existing IS-IS.  Implementations must assure
   that malformed TLV and Sub-TLV permutations do not result in errors
   which cause hard IS-IS failures.
