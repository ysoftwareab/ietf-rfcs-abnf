         An Acceptable Use Policy for New ICMP Types and Codes
                        draft-shore-icmp-aup-12

Abstract

   In this document we provide a basic description of ICMP's role in the
   IP stack and some guidelines for future use.

   This document is motivated by concerns about lack of clarity
   concerning when to add new Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
   types and/or codes.  These concerns have highlighted a need to
   describe policies for when adding new features to ICMP is desirable
   and when it is not.

Internet-Draft                  ICMP AUP                   February 2014


1.  Introduction

   There has been some recent concern expressed about a lack of clarity
   around when to add new message types and codes to ICMP (including
   ICMPv4 [RFC0792] and ICMPv6 [RFC4443]).  We lay out a description of
   when (and when not) to move functionality into ICMP.

   This document is the result of discussions among ICMP experts within
   the OPS area's IP Diagnostics Technical Interest Group [1] and
   concerns expressed by the OPS area leadership.

   Note that this document does not supercede the IANA Allocation
   Guidelines for Values in the Internet Protocol and Related Headers,
   RFC 2780 [RFC2780], which specifies best practices and processes for
   the allocation of values in the IANA registries but does not describe
   the policies to be applied in the standards process.


2.  Acceptable use policy

   In this document we describe an acceptable use policy for new ICMP
   message types and codes, and provide some background behind the
   policy.

   In summary, any future message types added to ICMP should be limited
   to two broad categories:

   1.  to inform a datagram's originator that a forwarding plane anomaly
       has been encountered downstream.  The datagram originator must be
       able to determine whether or not the datagram was discarded by
       examining the ICMP message
   2.  to discover and convey dynamic information about a node (other
       than information usually carried in routing protocols), to
       discover and convey network-specific parameters, and to discover
       on-link routers and hosts.

   Normally, ICMP SHOULD NOT be used to implement a general-purpose
   routing or network management protocol.  However, ICMP does have a
   role to play in conveying dynamic information about a network, which
   would belong in category 2 above.

2.1.  Classification of existing message types

   This section provides a rough breakdown of existing message types
   according to the taxonomy described in Section 2 at the time of
   publication.

2.1.1.  ICMP Use as a Routing Protocol

   As mentioned in Section 2, using ICMP as a general-purpose routing or
   network management protocol is not advisable, and SHOULD NOT be used
   that way.

   ICMP has a role in the Internet as an integral part of the IP layer.
   This is not as a routing protocol, or as a transport protocol for
   other layers including routing information.  From a more pragmatic
   perspective, some of the key characteristics of ICMP make it a less
   than ideal choice for a routing protocol.  Those include that ICMP is
   frequently filtered, is not authenticated, is easily spoofed, and



Shore & Pignataro        Expires August 7, 2014                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                  ICMP AUP                   February 2014


   that specialist hardward processing of ICMP would disrupt the
   deployment of an ICMP-based routing or management protocol.

2.1.2.  A few notes on RPL

   RPL, the IPv6 Routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (see
   [RFC6550]) uses ICMP as a transport.  In this regard, it is an
   exception among the ICMP message types.  Note that, although RPL is
   an IP routing protocol, it is not deployed on the general Internet,
   but is limited to specific, contained networks.

   This should be considered anomalous and is not a model for future
   ICMP message types.  That is, ICMP is not intended as a transport for
   other protocols and SHOULD NOT be used in that way in future
   specifications.  In particular, while it is adequate to use ICMP as a
   discovery protocol, this does not extend to full routing
   capabilities.

2.2.  Applications using ICMP

   Some applications make use of ICMP error notifications, or even
   deliberately create anomalous conditions in order to elicit ICMP
   messages, to then use those ICMP messages to generate feedback to the
   higher layer.  Some of these applications include most widespread
   examples such as PING, TRACEROUTE and Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD).
   These uses are considered acceptable as they use existing ICMP
   message types and do not change ICMP functionality.

2.3.  Extending ICMP

   ICMP multi-part messages are specified in [RFC4884] by defining an
   extension mechanism for selected ICMP messages.  This mechanism
   addresses a fundamental problem in ICMP extensibility.  An ICMP
   multi-part message carries all of the information that ICMP messages
   carried previously, as well as additional information that
   applications may require.

   Some currently defined ICMP extensions include ICMP extensions for
   Multiprotocol Label Switching [RFC4950] and ICMP extensions for
   interface and next-hop identification [RFC5837].

   Extensions to ICMP SHOULD follow [RFC4884].

2.4.  ICMPv4 vs. ICMPv6

   Because ICMPv6 is used for IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, deployed IPv6
   routers, IPv6-capable security gateways, and IPv6-capable firewalls
   normally support administrator configuration of how specific ICMPv6



Shore & Pignataro        Expires August 7, 2014                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                  ICMP AUP                   February 2014


   message types are handled.  By contrast, deployed IPv4 routers, IPv4-
   capable security gateways, and IPv4-capable firewalls are less likely
   to allow an administrator to configure how specific ICMPv4 message
   types are handled.  So, at present, ICMPv6 messages usually have a
   higher probability of travelling end-to-end than ICMPv4 messages.


3.  ICMP's role in the internet

   ICMP was originally intended to be a mechanism for gateways or
   destination hosts to report error conditions back to source hosts in
   ICMPv4 [RFC0792], and ICMPv6 [RFC4443] is modeled after it.  ICMP is
   also used to perform IP-layer functions, such as diagnostics (e.g.,
   "PING").

   ICMP is defined to be an integral part of IP, and must be implemented
   by every IP module.  This is true for ICMPv4 as an integral part of
   IPv4 (see the Introduction of [RFC0792]), and for ICMPv6 as an
   integral part of IPv6 (see Section 2 of [RFC4443]).  When first
   defined, ICMP messages were thought of as IP messages that didn't
   carry any higher layer data.  It could be conjectured that the term
   "control" was used given that ICMP messages were not "data" messages.

   The word "control" in the protocol name did not describe ICMP's
   function (i.e. it did not "control" the internet), but rather that it
   was used to communicate about the control functions in the internet.
   For example, even though ICMP included a redirect message type that
   affects routing behavior in the context of a LAN segment, it was and
   is not used as a generic routing protocol.


4.  Security considerations

   This document describes a high-level policy for adding ICMP types and
   codes.  While special attention must be paid to the security
   implications of any particular new ICMP type or code, this
   recommendation presents no new security considerations.

   From a security perspective, ICMP plays a part in the Photuris
   [RFC2521] protocol.  But more generally, ICMP is not a secure
   protocol, and does not include features to be used to discover
   network security parameters or to report on network security
   anomalies in the forwarding plane.

   Additionally, new ICMP functionality (e.g., ICMP extensions, or new
   ICMP types or codes) needs to consider potential ways of how ICMP can
   be abused (e.g., Smurf IP DoS [CA-1998-01]).

   There are no actions required by IANA.
