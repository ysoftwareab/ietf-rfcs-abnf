   1. Abstract

   The ISAKMP/Oakley document [HC97] describes a proposed standard for 
   using the Oakley Key Exchange Protocol in conjunction with ISAKMP to 
   obtain authenticated and secret keying material for use with ISAKMP, 
   and for other security associations such as AH and ESP for the IETF 
   IPsec DOI.

   The public-key encryption method of carrying out Phase 1 of the key
   exchange in the ISAKMP/Oakley document requires two public key 
   encryption and decryption operations from both the Initiator and 
   the Responder. The present document describes a small modification 
   to this method. The resulting method requires only one public key 
   encryption and decryption operation from each party, while maintaining 
   (and even improving on) the strong security properties of the 
   ISAKMP/Oakley public-key encryption mode.	

   Remark: This document is NOT self-contained. It uses notation and 
   definitions of [HC97]. It is best read in conjunction with [HC97].

   2. Introduction

   The ISAKMP/Oakley  protocol [HC97] defines three alternative methods of 
   carrying out Phase 1 of the key exchange. Two of these methods are usable 
   by parties that do not already share a secret key. These are the Signature
   Method (Section 5.1 in [HC97]) and the Encryption Method (Section 5.2
   in [HC97]).

   The Encryption Method enjoys several significant advantages over the 
   Signature Method. These advantages are sketched in Section 4.
   However, in the ISAKMP/Oakley draft the Encryption Method requires 
   TWO public key encryption and decryption operations for each party. 
   This is unnecessarily expensive. (In weak processors the extra 
   exponentiation may have a significantly adverse effect in performance.) 

   This document describes a simple modification of the ISAKMP/Oakley
   Encryption Method. The resulting method enjoys the same security 
   advantages, and requires only ONE public key encryption and decryption 
   operation for each party. This method, called the Revised Encryption 
   Method, is presented as an alternative method to the ISAKMP/Oakley 
   Encryption Method. In fact, the revised method enjoys even additional 
   security advantages on top of the ISAKMP/Oakley Encryption Method, 
   as elaborated below.

   The change from the ISAKMP/Oakley Encryption Method is basically as 
   follows. There, each party's identity and nonce are encrypted via 
   TWO separate applications of the public-key encryption algorithm. 
   (In fact, if the party's identity is long then this may require 
   additional applications of the public-key encryption algorithm.) 

   In the Revised Encryption Method the nonce is still encrypted
   using the public-key encryption algorithm. However, 
   the sending party's identity (and also the certificate, if it is 
   sent) is encrypted via symmetric encryption (e.g. DES), with a key 
   derived from the nonce. This solution adds no significant complexity to 
   the implementation and saves a costly long (RSA or other) exponentiation.
   In addition, the Key Exchange payload (ie. the DH challenges) is also
   encrypted using the same derived key. This provides additional protection
   against cryptanalysis of the DH exchange.
   
   The Revised Encryption mode has another advantage. The (optional)
   Certificate payload is also encrypted using the same derived key. 
   Consequently anonymity is preserved even if the certificate is sent 
   as part of the exchange. 

   The rest of this document is organized as follows. In Section 3
   the Revised Encryption Method is described. The description is 
   written in a way so that Section 3 can be read as a replacement to 
   Section 5.2 in [HC97]. Section 4 discusses some security advantages 
   of the Encryption Method relative to the Signature method. 
   (These advantages are shared by the Revised Encryption Method.)
   Appendix A holds the authentication method value of the new method 
   (see ISAKMP [MSST96] and Appendix A of [CH97]).

   3. The new method: Revised Encryption Method of Oakley Phase 1 

   Using public key encryption to authenticate the exchange, the
   ancillary information exchanged is encrypted nonces. Each party's
   ability to reconstruct a hash (proving that the other party decrypted
   the nonce) authenticates the exchange.

   In order to perform the public key encryption, the initiator must
   already have the responder's public key. In the case where a party
   has multiple public keys, a hash of the certificate of the initiator 
   used to encrypt the ancillary information is passed as part of the
   third message. In this way the responder can determine which
   corresponding private key to use to decrypt the encrypted payloads
   and identity protection is retained.

   The nonces are encrypted with the other party's public key.
   Only the body of the payload is encrypted, the payload header is
   left in the clear. The Key Exchange payloads (KE) and the identities 
   of the parties (IDii and IDir) are encrypted with the negotiated 
   symmetric encryption algorithm (e.g DES), using a key derived from 
   the nonce. If the Initiator's certificate is passed from Initiator to 
   Responder then, for anonymity, the certificate is also encrypted 
   under the same key.
   
   That is, Phase 1 (Main Mode) is defined as follows.


          Initiator                        Responder
         -----------                      -----------
          HDR, SA                   -->
                                    <--    HDR, SA
          HDR, [ HASH(1), ]
            <Ni>PubKey_r            -->
            <KE>Ke_i 
            <IDii>Ke_i
            [<Cert-I>Ke_i]
                                    <--  HDR, <Nr>PubKey_i
                                             <KE>Ke_r
                                             <IDir>Ke_r
          HDR*, HASH_I              -->
                                    <--    HDR*, HASH_R

   HASH(1) is a hash (using the negotiated hash function) of the 
   responder's certificate which the initiator is using to encrypt 
   the nonce.

   The notation <...>PubKey refers to public key encryption
   (e.g.  using the RSA algorithm) while the notation <...>Ke
   refers to encryption under the negotiated symmetric cipher.
   The keys for the symmetric cipher are derived as follows.
   First, derive the values Ne_i and Ne_r:

         Ne_i = prf(Ni, CKY-I)
         Ne_r = prf(Nr, CKY-R)

   Next, the keys Ke_i and Ke_r are derived from Ne_i and Ne_r,
   respectively, in the way described in Appendix B of [HC97].
   That is, to derive Ke_i run the procedure described in Appendix B of
   [HC97], where SKEYID_e is replaced by Ne_i. To derive Ke_r run the
   procedure described in Appendix B of [HC97], where SKEYID_e is 
   replaced by Ne_r. 

   For completeness, we detail the  procedure for deriving Ke_i.
   Ke_r is derived analogously. If the desired length of Ke_i is 
   at most the length of Ne_i then Ke_i is the sufficient number 
   of most significant bits of Ne_i. If the desired length of Ke_i 
   exceeds the length of Ne_i then more bits are generated by applying 
   the prf with Ne_i as the key and a byte of 0 as the input. 
   The output of the prf is fed back into itself until sufficient 
   number of bits are generated. For example, if the output of prf 
   is 128-bit long and Ne_i needs to be 320-bit long, then Ne_i is 
   the most significant 320 bits of K, where K = K1 | K2 | K3  and

           K1 = prf(Ne_i, 0)   
           K2 = prf(Ne_i, K1)
           K3 = prf(Ne_i, K2)

   Note that the values of Ke_i and Ke_r are ephemeral and discarded 
   after this use.

   If CBC mode is used for the symmetric encryption then the 
   initialization vectors (IV) are set as follows. The IV for 
   encrypting KE is set to 0. The IV for encrypting IDii (resp., IDir)   
   is the last ciphertext block of <KE>Ke_i (resp., <KE>Ke_r). 
   The IV for encrypting the certificate 
   is the last ciphertext block of <IDii>Ke_i (resp., <IDir>Ke_r).
   Encrypted payloads are padded up to the nearest block 
   size. All padding bytes, except for the last one, contain 0x00. 
   The last byte of the padding contains the number of the padding 
   bytes use, excluding the last one.
   Note that this means that there will always be padding.
   Note also that the IV chaining method used here implies that KE,
   the ID and the certificate have to be encrypted (and decrypted) in 
   that order.

   When a Certificate payload is sent in the context of
   the Revised Encryption Method, it MUST be encrypted in the manner
   described above.


     Oakley Aggressive Mode in conjunction with the Revised Encryption 
     Method is described as follows (notation is as described above):

          Initiator                        Responder
         -----------                      -----------
          HDR, SA, [ HASH(1),] 
            <Ni>Pubkey_r,
            <KE>Ke_i  
            <IDii>Ke_i               -->
            [<Cert-I>Ke_i]
                                           HDR, SA, <Nr>PubKey_i,
                                                <KE>Ke_r
                                    <--         <IDir>Ke_r, HASH_R
          HDR, HASH_I               -->



   RSA encryption MUST be encoded in PKCS #1 format. The payload length
   is the length of the entire encrypted payload plus header. The PKCS
   #1 encoding allows for determination of the actual length of the
   cleartext payload upon decryption.

   4. Security Considerations 
   ==========================

   In this section we sketch the advantages of authentication by 
   public-key encryption, as opposed to authentication by signature.
   First, in the Encryption mode an attacker has to break BOTH the
   the public key encryption in use (e.g. RSA) and DH exchange
   in order to learn the agreed key. In the Signature Mode breaking the
   DH exchange is sufficient. This is a substantial security advantage
   in a scenario where the same prime is used  to secure a large number
   of exchanges: such a prime will become an attractive
   target for cryptanalysis, thus it may provide only weak security.
   It also adds protection against a party that chooses weak parameters
   in the DH exchange, such as weak primes or short exponents.

   Next, using encryption for authentication provides for a plausibly
   deniable exchange. There is no proof (in contrast to the use of
   digital signatures) that the conversation ever took place since each
   party could have generated both sides of the exchange.

   Furthermore, unlike other authentication methods, authentication with
   public key encryption allows for identity protection even in
   Aggressive Mode.

   We remark that both the ISAKMP/Oakley Encryption Method and the
   Revised Encryption method described here are based on a similar
   mode in [Kra96] where a more extensive discussion on the above issues
   can be found.
