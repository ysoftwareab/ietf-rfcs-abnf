Abstract

   The control protocol used for constructing Point-to-Multipoint and
   Multipoint-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths ("MP LSPs") contains a
   field that identifies the address of a "root node".  Intermediate
   nodes are expected to be able to look up that address in their
   routing tables.  However, if the route to the root node is a BGP
   route, and the intermediate nodes are part of a BGP-free core, this
   is not possible.  This document specifies procedures which enable a
   MP LSP to be constructed through a BGP-free core.  In these
   procedures, the root node address is temporarily replaced by an
   address which is known to the intermediate nodes.

1. Introduction

   [MLDP] defines several LDP FEC element encodings: P2MP, MP2MP
   Upstream, and MP2MP Downstream.

   The encoding for these three FEC elements is shown in Figure 1.

                          MLDP FEC Element Encoding
                                  Figure 1

   Note that a P2MP or MP2MP label switched path ("MP LSP") is
   identified by the combination of a "root node" and a variable length
   "opaque value".  The root node also plays a special role in the MLDP
   procedures - MLDP messages that are "about" a particular MP LSP are
   forwarded to the LDP adjacency that is the next hop on the route to
   the root node.

   Sometimes it is desirable for a MP LSP to pass through a part of the
   network in which there is no route to the root node.  For instance,
   consider the following topology:



           CE1----PE1---P1---- ...----P2 ----PE2----CE2----R

                                Figure 2

   where CE1 and CE2 are "customer edge routers", PE1 and PE2 are
   "provider edge routers", but the provider's core is "BGP-free".  That
   is, PE1 has a BGP-learned route for R, in which PE2 is the BGP next
   hop.  However, the provider's interior routers (such as P1 and P2) do
   not have any BGP-learned routes, and in particular do not have any

Internet Draft     draft-wijnands-mpls-mldp-csc-02.txt      October 2009


   routes to R.

   In such an environment, data packets from CE1 address to R would get
   encapsulated by PE1, tunneled to PE2, decapsulated by PE2, and
   forwarded to CE2.

   Suppose now that CE1 is trying to set up a MP LSP whose root is R,
   and the intention is that the provider's network will participate in
   the construction of the LSP. Then the MLDP messages identifying the
   LSP must be passed from CE1 to PE1, from PE1 to P1, ..., from P2 to
   PE2, from PE2 to CE2, and from CE2 to R.

   To begin the process, CE1 creates a MP FEC element with the address
   of R as the root node address, and passes that FEC element via MLDP
   to PE1.  However, PE1 cannot use this same FEC element to identify
   the LSP in the LDP messages it sends to P1, because P1 does not have
   a route to R.

   However, PE1 does know that PE2 is the "BGP next hop" on the path to
   R.  What is needed is a method whereby:

     - PE1 can tell P1 to set up an LSP as if the root node were PE2,
       and

     - PE2 can determine that the LSP in question is really rooted at R,
       not at PE2 itself,

     - PE2 can determine the original FEC element that CE1 passed to
       PE1, so that PE2 can pass it on to CE2.

   This document defines the procedures that allow CE1 to create an LSP
   rooted at R.  These procedures require PE1 to modify the MP FEC
   element before sending an MLDP message to P1, and they also require
   PE2 to modify the MP FEC element before sending an MLDP message to
   CE2.

   A slight variation on these procedures, also specified in this
   document, provides mLDP support for "Carrier's Carrier" MVPN service
   [VPN, MVPN].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2. The Recursive Opaque Value Type

2.1. Encoding

   We define a new Opaque Value Type, the Recursive Opaque Value Type.

                       Recursive Opaque Value Type
                                 Figure 3


   The "opaque value" itself is a P2MP or MP2MP FEC element, encoded
   exactly as specified in [MLDP], with a type field, a length field,
   and value field of is own.  The length field of the Recursive Opaque
   Value Type thus includes the type and length fields of the FEC
   element that is the value field.


2.2. Procedures

   In the topology of Figure 2, let us suppose that CE1 sends PE1 an MP
   FEC element whose root node is R, and whose opaque value is Q.  We
   will refer to this FEC element as "CE1-FEC".

   PE1 determines that the root node R matches a BGP route, with a BGP
   next hop of PE2.  PE1 also knows by its configuration that the
   interior routers on the path to PE2 are "BGP-free", and thus have no
   route to R.

   PE1 therefore MUST create a new MP FEC element, whose root node
   address is the address of PE2, and whose opaque value is a type 6 FEC
   element whose value field contains CE1-FEC.  We refer to this FEC
   element as PE2-FEC.  PE1 then MUST send this FEC element to P1.

   As far as the interior routers are concerned, they are being
   requested to build a MP LSP whose root node is PE2.  They MUST NOT
   interpret the opaque value at all.



Wijnands, et al.                                                [Page 5]


Internet Draft     draft-wijnands-mpls-mldp-csc-02.txt      October 2009


   When PE2-FEC arrives at PE2, PE2 notes that it is the identified root
   node, and that the opaque value is a type 6 opaque value.  Therefore
   it MUST replace PE2-FEC with the contents of the type 6 opaque value
   (i.e., with CE1-FEC) before doing any further processing.  This will
   result in CE1-FEC being sent on to CE2, and presumably further from
   CE2 to R.


3. The VPN-Recursive MP FEC Element

3.1. Encoding

   We define a new Opaque Value Type, the VPN-Recursive Opaque Value
   Type.

                                 Figure 4



   The "opaque value" consists of an eight-octet Route Distinguisher
   (RD), followed by a P2MP or MP2MP FEC element, encoded exactly as
   specified in [MLDP], with a type field, a length field, and value
   field of is own.  The length field of the Recursive Opaque Value Type
   thus includes the 8 octets of RD plus the type and length fields of
   the FEC element that is the value field.

Internet Draft     draft-wijnands-mpls-mldp-csc-02.txt      October 2009


3.2. Procedures

   Referring again to the topology of Figure 2, suppose that PE1/PE2 are
   offering "Carrier's Carrier VPN Service" [VPN] to CE1/CE2.  CE1 sends
   PE1 an MP FEC element whose root node is R, and whose opaque value is
   Q.  We will refer to this FEC element as "CE1-FEC".  However, PE1's
   route to R will be in a VRF ("Virtual Routing and Forwarding Table").
   Therefore the FEC-element created by PE1 must contain some identifier
   that PE2 can use to find the proper VRF in which to look up the
   address of R.

   When PE1 looks up the address of R in a VRF, it will find a route in
   the VPN-IP address family.  The next hop will be PE2, but there will
   also be a Route Distinguisher (RD) as part of that NLRI of the
   matching route.  In this case, the new FEC element created by PE1
   MUST have the address of PE2 as the root node address, and MUST have
   a type 7 opaque value.

   The value field of the type 7 opaque value MUST consist of the
   8-octet RD followed by CE1-FEC.

   As far as the interior routers are concerned, they are being
   requested to build a MP LSP whose root node is PE2.  They MUST NOT
   interpret the opaque value at all.

   When PE2-FEC arrives at PE2, PE2 notes that it is the identified root
   node, and that the opaque value is a type 7 opaque value.  Therefore
   it MUST replace PE2-FEC with the contents of the type 7 opaque value
   (i.e., with CE1-FEC) before doing any further processing.  It also
   finds the VRF associated with the identified RD, and MUST use that
   VRF to lookup up the path to R.  This will result in CE1-FEC being
   sent on to CE2, and presumably further from CE2 to R.



4. IANA Considerations

   [MLDP] defines a registry for "The LDP MP Opaque Value Element Type".
   This document requires the assignment of two new code points in this
   registry:

     - Type 6.

       An opaque value of this type is itself a TLV that encodes an mLDP
       FEC type, as defined in [MLDP].

Internet Draft     draft-wijnands-mpls-mldp-csc-02.txt      October 2009


     - Type 7

       An opaque value of this type consists of an eight-octet Route
       Distinguisher as defined in [VPN], followed by a TLV that encodes
       an mLDP FEC type, as defined in [MLDP].
