Abstract

   The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a standard method for
   transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.  PPP
   is comprised of three main components:

      1. A method for encapsulating multi-protocol datagrams.

      2. A Link Control Protocol (LCP) for establishing, configuring,
         and testing the data-link connection.

      3. A family of Network Control Protocols (NCPs) for establishing
         and configuring different network-layer protocols.

   This document defines an interoperable method for negotiating
   dial-up callback over PPP links.

INTERNET-DRAFT       PPP Callback Control Protocol            April 1996


1.  Introduction

   Up-to-date values of the LCP Option Type field are specified in the
   most recent "Assigned Numbers" RFC [2].  This document concerns the
   following values:

      13      Callback

   In "PPP LCP Extensions" [3], callback may be negotiated as part of
   the LCP negotiation phase.

   There are two problems with the current scheme:

   a) There is a potential security hole. The callee has to agree or
      disagree to do the callback BEFORE authenticating the caller.

   b) The current scheme is too loosely defined to be truly
      interoperable.

   It is proposed that a new Callback Control Protocol be defined as a
   method to implement the Callback functionality in a secure,
   interoperable and flexible fashion.


1.1. Specification Requirements

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.

   MUST      This word, or the adjective "required", means that the
             definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.

   MUST NOT  This phrase means that the definition is an absolute
             prohibition of the specification.

   SHOULD    This word, or the adjective "recommended", means that there
             may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to
             ignore this item, but the full implications must be
             understood and carefully weighed before choosing a
             different course.

   MAY       This word, or the adjective "optional", means that this
             item is one of an allowed set of alternatives.  An
             implementation which does not include this option MUST be
             prepared to interoperate with another implementation which
             does include the option.

1.2 Terminology

   This document frequently uses the following terms:

   caller    The end of the link that initiated the connection.

   answerer  The end of the link that accepted the connection.

   peer      The other end of the point-to-point link.

   silently discard
             The implementation discards the packet without further
             processing.  The implementation SHOULD provide the
             capability of logging the error, including the contents of
             the silently discarded packet, and SHOULD record the event
             in a statistics counter.


2.0 Overview

   In the current scheme, callback is negotiated as part of the LCP
   phase.  We will extend this scheme by adding a new operation field
   value 6 to the existing Callback Configuration Option.

   If an implementation responds with a Configure-Ack to the Callback
   Configuration Option with the operation field value set to 6,
   then it is agreeing to negotiate Callback Control Protocol.

   The Callback Control Protocol is run immediately after the
   Authentication Phase if authentication was negotiated.  If
   authentication was not negotiated then the implementation MUST
   proceed directly to the Callback phase after the Link Establishment
   phase. During the Callback phase all NCP and network-layer packets
   received MUST be silently discarded.

   When the Callback Control Protocol has successfully negotiated a
   callback action, the peer MUST directly proceed to the Termination
   phase, and the link is disconnected.

   The peer then re-establishes the link, without negotiating Callback
   during the LCP phase.

   Authentication SHOULD be requested in turn by the implementation when
   it is called back, if mutual authentication is desired.

   The Protocol Field value for this Control Protocol is C029.

3.0 Callback Control Protocol


   The Callback Control Protocol is always initiated by the Answerer.
   Here is an example of such a dialog:


        Caller                                              Answerer
        ------                                              --------

                            Callback Request
                <-----------------------------------------
                  These are the callback options you have:

                  1) Caller will not be called back.
                  2) Caller MAY specify the address at which it
                     wishes to be called back at.


                            Callback Response
                ----------------------------------------->
                     Caller wants to be called back at xxxx.


                            Callback Ack
                <-----------------------------------------
                     OK, Caller will be called back at xxxx.
                   Disconnect and prepare to receive a call.




   In the Callback Phase, the Answerer will send a Callback Request
   listing the callback options available to the Caller.  Additional
   Callback Request packets MUST be sent until a valid Callback Response
   packet is received, or an optional retry counter expires.  If the
   retry counter expires, the implementation MUST terminate the link and
   MUST NOT proceed to the NCP phase.

   The Caller will respond with a Callback Response listing only the
   option that it wishes to use. The data of the option MAY be modified.

   If the Callback Response sent back by the Caller is valid and 
   acceptable to the Answerer, it will respond with a Callback Ack. Upon
   receiving the the Callback Ack the Caller should proceed to the Link
   Termination phase and prepare to receive a call.









Gidwani                     Informational                       [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT       PPP Callback Control Protocol            April 1996


   The only exception to the above occurs if the Caller requested not to
   be called back and the Answerer responded with a Callback Ack then 
   both peers MUST proceed to the NCP phase.

   If the Callback Response contains any invalid or unacceptable data,
   the Answerer MAY terminate the link, or resend the Callback Request.
   The Answerer MUST NOT proceed to the NCP phase.

   Because the Callback Ack send to the Caller may be lost the Answerer
   MUST wait for the Caller to send a LCP Terminate-Req or to resend the
   Callback Response.



3.1 Packet Format

   Exactly one Callback Control Protocol packet is encapsulated
   in the Information field of a PPP Data Link Layer frame.
   A summary of the CBCP packet format is shown below.  The
   fields are transmitted from left to right.

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |     Code      |  Identifier   |            Length             |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |    Data ...
   +-+-+-+-+

   Code

      The Code field is one octet and identifies the type of CBCP
      packet.  CBCP Codes are assigned as follows:

         1       Callback Request       ( Answerer -> Caller )
         2       Callback Response      ( Caller   -> Answerer )
         3       Callback Ack           ( Answerer -> Caller )

   Identifier

      The Identifier field is one octet and aids in matching requests
      and replies.

   Length

      The Length field is two octets and indicates the length of the
      CBCP packet including the Code, Identifier, Length and Data
      fields.  Octets outside the range of the Length field should be
      treated as Data Link Layer padding and should be ignored on
      reception.

   Data

      The Data field is zero or more octets.



3.2 Callback Configuration Options

    0                   1                   2
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3

   | Callback Type |    Length     |Callback delay |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Callback Address(es) ...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

    Callback Type

    1 - No callback
    2 - Callback to a user-specifiable number.
    3 - Callback to a pre-specified or administrator specified number.
    4 - Callback to any of a list of numbers.


    Length

      The Length field is one octet and indicates the length of the
      Callback Option including the Type, Length and Data fields.

      >=3


    Callback delay

        The amount of time is seconds the Answerer MUST wait before
        calling the Caller back.  Answerer sets to 0, Caller MAY change 
        if the required value if is different from 0.

        <= 255

    Callback Addresses

    0                   1                   2
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Address Type  |    ASCIIZ address
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

        Address Type

            1 - for PSTN/ISDN

            Other? (TBD)

        Address Format

            For PSTN/ISDN this is an NULL terminated ASCII string.

            Valid characters are 0-9, *, #, T, P, W, @, comma, space,
            dash, and parentheses."



3.2.1 No Callback

    The Caller requests not to be called back at all. The Callback Type
    is set to 1.

    No Callback address or Callback Delay field is supplied.


3.2.2 Callback to a Caller-specifiable number.

    The Caller requests to be called back at a specified address.  The
    Callback Type field is set to 2.

    Callback address and the Callback Delay are both present.

    When the Answerer sends this option as part of the list of Callback
    options available to the Caller, the Callback Delay field is present
    and set to 0, Address Type field of the Callback Address is set but
    the ASCIIZ address contains a terminating NULL.

    The Caller MUST respond with a Callback Response which contains an
    ASCIIZ Callback address that matches the Address Type field send by
    the Answerer in the Callback Request. The Caller MAY modify the 
    value of the Callback Delay.

INTERNET-DRAFT       PPP Callback Control Protocol            April 1996


3.2.3 Callback to a pre-specified or administrator specified number.

    The Caller will be called back at specified address. The Callback
    Type field is set to 3.

    Only the Callback Delay field is present in the is Callback Request.

    The Caller MAY modify the Callback Delay field.


3.2.4 Callback to any of a list of numbers.

    The Caller will be called back at one of the specified address. The
    Callback Type field is set to 4.

    The Callback Request consists of the Callback Delay field followed
    by a list of Callback Addresses.

    The Callback Response MUST contain the Callback Delay and only one
    of the Callback Addresses chosen from the list sent by the Answerer.
