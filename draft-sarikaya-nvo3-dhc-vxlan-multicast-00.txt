       DHCP Options for Configuring Multicast Addresses in VXLAN
             draft-sarikaya-nvo3-dhc-vxlan-multicast-00.txt

Abstract

   This document defines DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 options for assigning
   multicast addresses for the Tunnel End Point in the Virtual
   eXtensible Local Area Network (VXLAN) environments.  New DHCP options
   are defined which allow a VXLAN Tunnel End Point to request any
   source multicast address for the newly created virtual machine and
   possibly IPv4/IPv6 address(es) for the virtual machine.

Internet-Draft   VXLAN Multicast Addresses DHCP Options    February 2014


1.  Introduction

   Data center networks are being increasingly used by telecom operators
   as well as by enterprises.  Currently these networks are organized as
   one large Layer 2 network in a single building.  In some cases such a
   network is extended geographically using virtual Local Area Network
   (VLAN) technologies still as an even larger Layer 2 network
   connecting the virtual machines (VM), each with its own MAC address.

   Another important requirement was growing demand for multitenancy,
   i.e. multiple tenants each with their own isolated network domain.
   In a data center hosting multiple tenants, each tenant may
   independently assign MAC addresses and VLAN IDs and this may lead to
   potential duplication.

   What we need is IP based tunneling scheme based overlay network
   called Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network (VXLAN).  VXLAN overlays
   a Layer 2 network over a Layer 3 network.  Each overlay, identified
   by the VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI).  This allows up to 16M VXLAN
   segments to coexist within the same administrative domain
   [I-D.mahalingam-dutt-dcops-vxlan].  In VXLAN, each MAC frame is
   transmitted after encapsulation, i.e. an outer Ethernet header, an
   IPv4/IPv6 header, UDP header and VXLAN header are added.  Outer
   Ethernet header indicates an IPv4 or IPv6 payload.  VXLAN header
   contains 24-bit VNI.

   VXLAN tunnel end point (VTEP) is the hypervisor on the server which
   houses the VM.  VXLAN encapsulation is only known to the VTEP, the VM
   never sees it.  Also the tunneling is stateless, each MAC frame is
   encapsulated independent on any other MAC frame.

   Instead of using UDP header, Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)
   encapsulation can be used.  A 24-bit Virtual Subnet Identifier (VSID)
   is placed in the GRE key field.  The resulting encapsulation is
   called Network Virtualization using Generic Routing Encapsulation
   (NVGRE) [I-D.sridharan-virtualization-nvgre].  Note that VSID is
   simlar to VNI.  Although VXLAN terminology is used throughout, the
   protocol defined in this document applies to VXLAN as well as NVGRE.

   It should be noted that in this document, VTEP plays the role of the
   Network Virtualization Edge (NVE) according to NVO3 architecture for
   overlay networks like VXLAN or NVGRE defined in [I-D.ietf-nvo3-arch].
   NVE interfaces the tenant system underneath with the L3 network
   called the Virtual Network (VN).

   As stated in NVO3 architecture document [I-D.ietf-nvo3-arch] for
   tenant multicast (or broadcast) traffic, an NVE MUST maintain a
   per-VN table of mappings and other information on how to deliver

   multicast (or broadcast) traffic.  Since we assume that the
   underlying network supports IP multicast, the NVE could use IP
   multicast to deliver tenant traffic.  In such a case, the NVE would
   need to know what IP underlay multicast address to use for a given
   VN.

   In this document, we develop a protocol to assign multicast addresses
   to the VXLAN tunnel end points or NVEs using Dynamic Host
   Configuration Protocol (DHCP).  Multicast communication in VXLAN is
   used for sending broadcast MAC frames, e.g. the Address Resolution
   Protocol (ARP) broadcast frame.  Multicast communication can also be
   used to transmit multicast frames and unknown MAC destination frames.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  The
   terminology in this document is based on the definitions in
   [I-D.mahalingam-dutt-dcops-vxlan] and [I-D.ietf-nvo3-arch].


3.  Overview of the protocol

   Multicast addresses to be assigned by the DHCP server are
   administratively scoped multicast addresses, in IPv4 [RFC2365] and in
   IPv6 [RFC4291].  The steps involved in the protocol are explained
   below for IPv4:

   Creation of a VM

      In this step, VTEP receives a request from the Management Node to
      create a Virtual Machine with a VXLAN Network Identifier.

   DHCP Operation

      VTEP starts DHCP state machine by sending DHCPDISCOVER message to
      the default router, e.g. the Top of Rack (ToR) switch.  ToR switch
      could be DHCP server or most possibly DHCP relay with DHCP server
      located upstream.  VTEP MUST include the VXLAN Multicast Address
      and VXLAN Rendezvous Point Address options defined in this
      document.  VTEP sends the VXLAN Network Identifier in the newly
      defined VNI DHCP Option.  DHCP server replies with DHCPOFFER
      message.  DHCP server sends administratively scope IPv4 multicast
      address.  VTEP checks this message and if it sees the options it
      requested, DHCP server is confirmed to support the multicast
      address options.  DHCPREQUEST message from VTEP and DHCPACK

      message from DHCP server complete DHCP message exchange.

   VTEP as Multicast Source

      After receiving the required information, the VTEP as multicast
      source communicates with the Rendezvous Point in order to build
      the multicast tree.

   VTEP as Listener

      After receiving the required information, the VTEP as listener
      communicates with the edge router by sending IGMP Report to join
      the multicast group.


   IPv6 operation is slightly different:

   Creation of a VM

      In this step, VTEP receives a request from the Management Node to
      create a Virtual Machine with a VXLAN Network Identifier.

   DHCP Operation

      VTEP starts DHCP state machine by sending DHCPv6 Solicit message
      to the default router, e.g. the Top of Rack (ToR) switch.  ToR
      switch could be DHCP server or most possibly DHCP relay with DHCP
      server located upstream.  VTEP MUST include the options defined in
      this document.DHCP server replies with DHCPv6 Advertise message.
      VTEP checks this message and if it sees the options it requested,
      DHCP server is confirmed to support multicast address options.
      DHCPv6 Request message from VTEP and DHCPv6 Reply message from
      DHCPv6 server complete DHCP message exchange.

   VTEP as Multicast Source

      After receiving the required information, the VTEP as multicast
      source communicates with the Rendezvous Point in order to build
      the multicast tree.

   VTEP as Listener

      After receiving the required information, the VTEP as listener
      communicates with the edge router by sending MLD Report to join
      the multicast group.

4.   DHCPv6 Options

4.1.  VXLAN Network Identifier Option

   Different VXLAN Network Identifiers (VNI) need different multicast
   groups, and even rendezvous point addresses (for load balancing).  At
   the same time, different VNIs need different address spaces for VM,
   that is, two VMs belongs to different VNIs probably have the same IP
   address.

   Because of the reasons stated above, a DHCP VNI Option is defined as
   follows.

   multicast address to DHCP server and receive administratively scoped
   IPv6 multicast address.

              VTEP as DHCP Client sets a1-a3 to VNI and a4 to zero.


5.2.  VXLAN Multicast Address Option

   The option allows the VTEP to send the VNI DHCP server and receive
   administratively scoped IPv4 multicast address.

       a1-a4
           VTEP as DHCP Client sets a1-a4 to zero, DHCP server sets a1-a4 to the multicast address.



6.  Client Operation

   In DHCPv4, the client, VTEP MUST set 'htype' and 'chaddr' fields to
   specify the client link-layer address type and the link-layer
   address.  The client must set the hardware type, 'htype' to 1 for
   Ethernet [RFC1700] and 'chaddr' is set to the MAC address of the
   virtual machine.

   The client MUST set VXLAN Multicast Address Option to zero.  The
   client MUST set VXLAN Rendezvous Point Address Option to zero.  The
   client MUST set VXLAN Network Identifier Option to the VXLAN network
   identifier assigned to the virtual machine.

   In DHCPv6, the client MUST use OPTION_CLIENT_LINKLAYER_ADDR defined
   in [RFC6939] to send the MAC address.  In this option, link-layer
   type MUST be set to 1 for Ethernet and link-layer address MUST be set
   to the MAC address of VM.  Note that in [RFC6939],
   OPTION_CLIENT_LINKLAYER_ADDR is defined to be used in Relay-Forward

   DHCP message.  In this document this option MUST be sent in DHCPv6
   Solicit message.

   The client MUST set IPv6 VNI Option OPTION_VNI to the VXLAN network
   identifier assigned to the virtual machine.

   The Client MUST set IPv6 multicast address for the VNI Option's
   multicast address field to zero.

   The client MUST set Solicited Node Multicast Address to zero if the
   neighbor discovery message is sent to all-nodes multicast address.
   The client MUST set Solicited Node Multicast Address to the low-order
   24 bits of an address of the destination if the neighbor discovery
   message is sent to the solicited-node multicast address.


7.  Server Operation

   If DHCPv4 server is configured to support VXLAN multicast address
   assignments, it SHOULD look for VXLAN Multicast Address Option in
   DHCPDISCOVER message.  The server MUST return in VXLAN Multicast
   Address Option's a1-a4 an organization-local scope IPv4 multicast
   address (239.192.0.0/14) [RFC2365].  The server MUST use the VNI
   value for obtaining the organization-local scope IPv4 multicast
   address.  VNI value is directly copied to 239.192.0.0/14 if the first
   6 bits are zero, i.e. no overflow ranges need to be used.  Otherwise,
   either of 239.0.0.0/10, 239.64.0.0/10 and 239.128.0.0/10 overflow
   ranges SHOULD be used.  Note that these ranges can accomodate the VNI
   in its entirety.

   If DHCPv6 server is configured to support VXLAN multicast address
   assignments it SHOULD look for IPv6 multicast address for the VNI
   Option and IPv6 Rendezvous Point Address Option in DHCPv6 Solicit
   message.  The server MUST return in IPv6 multicast address field an
   Admin-Local scope IPv6 multicast address (FF04/16) by copying the VNI
   of the virtual machine to the least significant 24 bits of the group
   ID field and setting all other bits to zero if Solicited Node
   Multicast Address field received from the client was set to zero.
   Otherwise the Solicited Node Multicast Address field is copied to
   bits 47-24 of the group ID field and all leading bits are set to
   zero.


8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [RFC2131], [RFC2132] and [RFC3315]
   apply.  Special considerations in [I-D.mahalingam-dutt-dcops-vxlan]
   are also applicable.

   IANA is requested to assign the OPTION_VNI and OPTION_MA and VXLAN
   Network Identifier and VXLAN Multicast Address Option Codes in the
   registry maintained for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6.
