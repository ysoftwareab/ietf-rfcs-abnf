   device.  The IPSP IPsec Action MIB integrates directly with the IPsec
   Security Policy Database Configuration MIB and it is meant to work
   within the framework of an action referenced by that MIB.

Internet-Draft           IPSP IPsec Action MIB              October 2004



1.  Introduction


   This document defines a MIB module for configuration of an IPsec
   action within the IPsec security policy database (SPD).  This module
   works within the framework of the IPsec Security Policy Database
   Configuration MIB (IPSP-SPD-MIB).  It can be referenced as an action
   by the IPSP-SPD-MIB and is used to configure IPsec SA's that can be
   created for network traffic between devices.


   The companion document [RFCXXXX], documents the IPsec Security Policy
   Database Configuration MIB.  For information surrounding the
   configuration of IKE and its parameters, see the companion document
   [RFCYYYY] which documents the IPsec Security Policy IKE Action MIB.


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework


   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410]


   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3.  Relationship to the DMTF Policy Model


   The Distributed Management Task Force has created an object oriented
   model of IPsec policy information known as the IPsec Policy Model
   White Paper [IPPMWP].  The contents of this document are also
   reflected in the "IPsec Configuration Policy Model" (IPCP) [RFC3585].
   This MIB module is a task specific derivation of the IPsec actions
   portions of the IPCP for use with SNMPv3.  This includes the
   necessary transform, negotiation, and IPsec action information
   required to create an IPsec SA within the IPsec Policy framework.


4.  MIB Module Overview


   The MIB module describes the necessary information to implement IPsec
   actions and there associated Security Associations referred to by the
   IPsec Security Policy Database Configuration MIB.  A basic
   understanding of IPsec processing, of the IPsec Configuration Policy
   Model and of how actions fit in to the framework of the IPSP-SPD-MIB
   are required to use this MIB properly.

6.  Security Considerations







Baer, et al.             Expires April 20, 2005                [Page 38]
Internet-Draft           IPSP IPsec Action MIB              October 2004



6.1  Introduction


   This document defines a MIB module used to configure IPsec policy
   services.  Since IPsec provides security services it is important
   that the IPsec configuration data be at least as protected as the
   IPsec provided security service.  There are two threats you need to
   thwart when configuring IPsec devices.


   1.  To make sure that only the official administrators are allowed to
       configure a device, only authenticated administrators should be
       allowed to do device configuration.  The support for SET
       operations in a non-secure environment without proper protection
       can have a negative effect on network operations.


   2.  Unfriendly parties should not be able to read configuration data
       while the data is in network transit.  Any knowledge about a
       device's IPsec policy configuration could help an unfriendly
       party compromise that device and/or a network it protects.  It is
       thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
       possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending
       them over the network via SNMP.


   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.


   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).


   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.


   Therefore, when configuring data in the IPSEC-SPD-MIB, you SHOULD use
   SNMP version 3.  The rest of this discussion assumes the use of
   SNMPv3.  This is a real strength, because it allows administrators
   the ability to load new IPsec configuration on a device and keep the
   conversation private and authenticated under the protection of SNMPv3
   before any IPsec protections are available.  Once initial
   establishment of IPsec configuration on a device has been achieved,




Baer, et al.             Expires April 20, 2005                [Page 39]
Internet-Draft           IPSP IPsec Action MIB              October 2004



   it would be possible to set up IPsec SAs to then also provide
   security and integrity services to the configuration conversation.
   This may seem redundant at first, but will be shown to have a use for
   added privacy protection below.


6.2  Protecting against in-authentic access


   The current SNMPv3 User Security Model provides for key based user
   authentication.  Typically, keys are derived from passwords (but are
   not required to be), and the keys are then used in HMAC algorithms
   (currently MD5 and SHA-1 HMACs are defined) to authenticate all SNMP
   data.  Each SNMP device keeps a (configured) list of users and keys.
   Under SNMPv3 user keys may be updated as often as an administrator
   cares to have users enter new passwords.  But Perfect Forward Secrecy
   for user keys is not yet provided by standards track documents,
   although RFC2786 defines an experimental method of doing so.


6.3  Protecting against involuntary disclosure


   While sending IPsec configuration data to a PEP, there are a few
   critical parameters which MUST NOT be observed by third parties.
   These include IKE Pre-Shared Keys and possibly the private key of a
   public/private key pair for use in a PKI.  Were either of those
   parameters to be known to a third party, they could then impersonate
   your device to other IKE peers.  Aside from those critical
   parameters, policy administrators have an interest in not divulging
   any of their policy configuration.  Any knowledge about a device's
   configuration could help an unfriendly party compromise that device.
   SNMPv3 offers privacy security services, but at the time this
   document was written, the only standardized encryption algorithm
   supported by SNMPv3 is the DES encryption algorithm.  Support for
   other (stronger) cryptographic algorithms was in the works and may be
   done as you read this.  Policy administrators SHOULD use a privacy
   security service to configure their IPsec policy which is at least as
   strong as the desired IPsec policy.  E.G., it is unwise to configure
   IPsec parameters implementing 3DES algorithms while only protecting
   that conversation with single DES.


6.4  Bootstrapping your configuration


   Hopefully vendors will not ship new products with a default SNMPv3
   user/password pair, but it is possible.  Most SNMPv3 distributions
   should hopefully require an out-of-band initialization over a trusted
   medium, such as a local console connection.
