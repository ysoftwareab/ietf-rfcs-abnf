1.  Introduction

   Since the time sensitive network and deterministic network were
   proposed, the application use case has always been the hottest topic.
   It may originate from the industry, audio and video, and has more
   demand in the era of 5G and industrial Internet.  As years of
   development, TSN has been used in several industries, and has enough
   public awareness of the industry for it's scope.  DetNet also has
   done a lot of work and the standards are mature, and people concern
   more on how to guarantee the deterministic demand on Layer 3 network.

   However, when to provide deterministic network services, network
   providers always face the problem of how to match application needs
   to the technology, so more work are needed for network service
   providers to successfully sell DetNet type services to customers.
   For example,

   The service level objective definitions, considering absolute or
   relative latency and jitter bounds, flows types and physcial network
   scale;

   The suitable queuing mechanisms, considering more option of queuing
   mechanisms for different service level;

   The deployment issues, considering how to integrate into existing
   networks, service, and controller-plane.

2.  Diversified application requirements and trial status

2.1.  Different levels of application requirements

   [RFC8578]gives some requirements of industry, electricity, buildings,
   etc.. some of them clearly specify the requirements for latency and
   jitter, while some not for the jitter.  Different types of users have
   different demand, just as network provider provide different network
   services for personal business or enterprise business, so as to the
   detnet service for defferent uses.

   One kind has critical SLAs requirement, such as remote control or
   cloud PLC of manufacturing and differential protection of
   electricity.  If these services exceed the boundaries of latency and
   jitter, it will bring property losses and security risks, so they
   can't tolerate with any non-deterministic situation and can pay more
   on the network service.

   Another kind has relatively lower levels of SLA requirement, such as
   cloud gaming, cloud VR and online meeting for "consumer" networks.
   Users of these applications hope to have a better network experience,

   but they can tolerate it to a certain extent if the network quality
   is not good sometime.  So they are willing to spend more money for
   high-quality network services.  In some aspects, because such
   services have no industry barriers and can tolerate exceeding the
   upper boundary of latency within a small probability, they have
   relatively lower requirements for the network and may be easier to
   deploy.

   Different application needs are actually related to cost.  For strict
   deterministic services, strict technologies need to be used, and all
   network devices may need to be upgraded.  For non strict
   deterministic services, it may only be necessary to upgrade some
   equipment or share corresponding network resources.

                    Critical latency requirements:

        |      <->| Industrial, tight jitter, hard latency limit
        |<------->| Industrial, hard latency limit
        |
        |<-------------.....>  Relatively lower latency requirements
        |
        |<-------------........................>   Best effort
        |
        +---------------------------------------------------------->
                                                             latency

      Figure 1: Figure 1: Different levels of application requirements

2.2.  Examples in terms of large scale

   Ahead of the formulation of standards, some trials have been carried
   out to verify large-scale deterministic networks.

   In order to verify the deterministic technology of large-scale
   networks, A trial of Deterministic IP on China Environment for
   Network Innovations(CENI) was deployed, which is a network built for
   new network technology's trial.  This trial spanned 3000km and has
   13-hopsdevices, the jitter is controlled within 100us.

   In order to verify the remote control on Deterministic IP, which
   required that the latency should be controlled within 4ms and jitter
   should be controlled within 20us.  A trial cooperated with Baosteel
   spanned 600km was deployed.  Baosteel is a Chinese steel company and
   put forward this demand.  Both of the first and second trials are
   based on a frequency synchronization solution.

   In order to realize multi flows synchronization on inter provincial
   network in an exhibition, Emergen proposed the requirements that two
   flows of video and VR were sent from province A, and arrived at
   province B together, so the people can see the synchronization of
   video collected by camera and the VR model.  This requirement was
   proposed to facilitate the virtual industry product deployment.  Due
   to time and other problems, it was realized by the edge network
   device for a relatively lower levels of SLA.

   These trials show that both operators and enterprise users begin to
   put forward requirements for the certainty of large-scale networks,
   but the implementation technologies are not exactly the same.

3.  Technical requirements in large scale deterministic network

   Due to the different kinds of application requirements in large scale
   network, the corresponding technique requirements should be
   considered.

3.1.  Tolerate time asynchrony

3.1.1.  Support asynchronous clocks across domains

   A large scale network may span over multiple networks with one or
   more administrators.  One of DetNet's objectives is to stitch TSN
   islands together.  All devices inside a TSN domain are time-
   synchronized, and most of TSN technologies rely on precise time
   synchronization[TSN-Qbv][TSN-Qch][TSN-Qav].  However, different TSN
   islands may have different clocks which are not synchronized as shown
   in Figure 2, where the time difference of two TSN domain is D.
   DetNet needs to connect these two TSN domains together and provide
   end-to-end deterministic latency service.  The mechanism adopted by
   DetNet should be able to support the interaction across time domains
   by putting extra buffer space at the ingress of a new domain or
   increase the dead time as a guard band, or using some timing
   compensation mechanism.  This document does not intend to list all
   the potential ways.

3.1.2.  Tolerate clock jitter & wander within a clock synchronous domain

   Within a single time synchronization domain, different clock accuracy
   is expected, for example the crystal oscillator in Ethernet is
   specified at 100 ppm[Fast-Ethernet-MII-clock], SyncE can achieve 50
   ppb[G.8262], and more precise time synchronization[G.8273] is
   expected in 5G mobile backhaul.  The clocks experience different
   jitter and wander.  It may cause different level of asymmetry of the
   path.  The large scale networks should be able to recover or absorb
   such time variance within a domain and across multiple domains.

3.1.3.  Provide mechanisms not requiring full time synchronization

   Some networks like mobile backhaul use frequency synchronization such
   as SyncE instead of the strict time synchronization.  It is usually
   hard to achieve the full time synchronization in large scale networks
   when considering the diameter of the network topology.  It is desired
   that the same deterministic performance in term of the bounded
   latency and jitter can be achieved when full time synchronization is
   not in used, that is to say, when only partial synchronization (SyncE
   is one of the examples) is in use.

3.1.4.  Support asynchronization based methods

   There are large amount of traffic flows in large scale network and
   some of them are acyclic.  Asynchronization based methods can meet
   the requirements of those traffic flow.  Moreover, The mechanisms not
   requiring the time and/or frequency synchronization eliminate the
   hardware cost and difficulty at the network nodes.  [TSN-Qcr]
   conceptually uses per-flow based asynchronous shaper to achieve
   bounded latency.  The formula proof shows its effectiveness.  It can

   naturally tolerate the time variance, but it exhibits the concerns of
   per-flow state buffer management as shown in
   [I-D.eckert-detnet-bounded-latency-problems] When it is in use, the
   requirement in subsection 3.3 should be carefully met.

3.2.  Support the large single-hop propagation latency

   In a large scale network, a single hop distance is enough to generate
   a larger latency.  The speed of optical transmission in fiber is
   200km/ms.  Thus the propagation delay of a single hop can be in the
   order of low number of msec.  It is much great than a LAN, and
   introduces impacts on queuing mechanisms, such as cyclic or time
   aware scheduling method.

   For cyclic based method, suppose a large scale network wants to keep
   using the simple cycle mapping relationship, however the link
   distance between two nodes is longer.  Moreover, a downstream node
   may have many upstream nodes each with different link propagation
   delays (e.g., 9 us, 10 us, 11 us, 15 us and 20 us).  In order to
   absorb the longest link propagation delay, then the length of cycle
   must be set to at least 20 us.  However since packet's arrival time
   varies within the receiving cycle, larger cycle length means larger
   delay variance.

3.3.  Accommodate the higher link speed

   The large scale network normally uses the higher link speed,
   especially for its backbone.  Current deterministic mechanisms used
   in the local network is usually deployed in link speed of 10Mbps or
   1Gbps&#65292; and possibly 10Gbps.  The data rate of 10G, 100G, 400G
   and even higher is commonly used in wide area networks.  With the
   increasing of the data rate, the network scheduling cycle can be
   reduced if the same amount of the data is required to be sent each
   cycle for each application.  Or more data can be sent if the network
   cycle time remains the same.  For the former, it requires the more
   precise time control (e.g. cycle in the order of low number of usec
   or sub-usec) for the input stream gate and the timed output buffer.
   For the latter, more buffer space is required which imposes more
   complex buffer or queue management and larger memory consumption.

   Another aspect to consider is the aggregation of the flows.  In the
   large scale network, the number of flows can be hundreds or tens of
   thousands.  They can be aggregated into a few number of deterministic
   path or tunnels.  It is practical to have a few flow-based or
   aggregated-flow based status in a local network.  But in higher speed
   and larger scale network, it is hardly feasible.  If TSN-ATS[] is in
   use, it requires more number of buffers comparing to the other full/
   partial time synchronized mechanisms.  Therefore it requires
   optimizations to support higher link speed.

3.4.  Be scalable

   Comparing to a LAN, large scale network may has more network devices
   and traffic flows, and there is a greater possibility of adding or
   removing network devices and traffic flows.  The deterministic
   latency forwarding mechanisms must scale to networks of significant
   size with numerous network devices and massive traffic flows.

3.4.1.  Be scalable to numerous network devices

   The increase or decrease of network devices in large-scale networks
   is more frequent than that in LAN.  The change of the number of
   devices may affect the implementation and adjustment of deterministic
   network mechanism&#65292;such as the topology
   discovery&#12289;queuing mechanism and packet replication and
   elimination . A simple use case to understand is ultra-low-latency
   (public) 5G transport networks, which would require DetNet extend to
   every 5G base station.  For some network operators, their network may
   need to connect to ~100 K base stations (serving multiple mobile
   networks operators'), and this number will only increase with 5G.

Internet-Draft          Deterministic Networking            October 2021


3.4.2.  Be scalable to massive traffic flows

   It is almost impossible to identify individual IP flow at the Detnet
   data plane because of the large overhead and resource reservation for
   massive number of flows.  Detnet allows the leverage of the flow
   aggregation.  With the large scaling of the network, proper provision
   at the control plane to accommodate such higher aggregation is
   required.  Individual flow may join and exit the aggregated flow
   rapidly which causes the dynamic in identification of the aggregated
   Detnet flow.  The wildcards, value range used in the identification
   may have to change in order to ensure the aggregated flows have
   compatible deterministic characteristics.  If each ultra-low-latency
   slice or MNO is treated as a separate deterministic latency traffic
   flow (or tunnel), then even if each base station has a limited number
   of ultra-low latency slices or MNOs (e.g. ~10), there will still be a
   lot of, ~1M, deterministic latency traffic flows on one network
   simultaneously.

3.5.  Tolerate failures of links or nodes and topology changes

   Network link failures are more common in large-scale networks.  Path
   switching or re-convergence of routing will cause high latency of
   packet loss and retransmission, which is usually in seconds before
   the network is stable again.  It is necessary to support certain
   mechanisms to adapt to failures of links or nodes and topology
   changes.

   The change of path or topology poses a higher challenge to packet
   replication and elimination.  The full disjoint paths when
   implementing PREOF gives the better survival chance when one of the
   nodes in the path fails.  At the same time, it brings the challenges
   of finding paths with similar distance and/or number of hops so that
   there is enough buffer space to absorb the latency difference caused
   by different paths when the scale is large.

Internet-Draft          Deterministic Networking            October 2021


3.6.  Support incremental device updates

   Do more shaping work on edge devices, so as to reduce the task of
   intermediate devices, which can be an advantage of deterministic
   network compared with the dedicated network.  Since some applications
   that requires relatively loose levels of SLA,it will be acceptable
   for those applications to tolerate a deterministic low probability to
   exceed the upper boundary of latency.  For those applications, some
   simple solutions that may be realized by update and configure the
   ingress and egress devices or part of network devices are expected.
   When the devices or traffic flows change, it can be realized through
   simple configuration.  Meanwhile, the critical SLA of some
   applications, can be achieved by adding the existing or other new
   mechanisms and updating more devices.

4.  Summary of the proposed queuing mechanisms besides TSN and IntServ/
    GS

   There are some proposed queuing mechanisms beside TSN and IntServ/
   Guaranteed service, which are not included in draft-ietf-detnet-
   bounded-latency.

   [I-D.dang-queuing-with-multiple-cyclic-buffers]and
   [I-D.qiang-detnet-large-scale-detnet] are based on frequency
   synchronization and multiple cyclic buffers, and can be proved to
   provide the bounded latency and jitter.  They use the flow
   aggregation and the Scalability is also good.

   [I-D.du-detnet-layer3-low-latency] proposes a method to decrease the
   micro-burst based on a adjustable buffer.  Though it can't prove a
   strict bounded latency, and the levels of deterministic is medium, it
   doesn't need the synchronization and have a good scalability, and can
   be easier deployed.

   [I-D.stein-srtsn] is to encapsulate the time stamp in the packet,
   based on which can adjust forwarding behavior.  The scalability is a
   driving force behind this draft, and the determinism is statistical
   in theory.

   [I-D.shi-quic-dtp] is also based on the time stamp, which is a layer
   4 solution.  It's listed there to show that the latency is more
   important than before of the application requirements, and there is
   also queuing mechanism besides Layer 3 solution.

5.  Conclusion

   This draft specifies the technical requirements when ensuring the
   deterministic features in the large scale networks.  Some of the
   proposed queueing mechanisms are analyzed and the authors of the
   document think those proposals give reasonably insights to
   enhancement the current queueing mechanisms to meet the deterministic
   requirements of the large scale networks.

6.  Security Considerations

   TBD.

7.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.
