2. Abstract

   Certain types of LDAP applications can benefit from the ability to
   specify the beginning and end of a related group of operations.  For
   example, the LDUP multimaster update protocol [ARCHITECTURE] requires
   that two servers agree to begin a session to transfer pending
   replication updates. This document provides a framework for
   constructing protocols that feature a framed set of related
   operations.  It defines a pair of LDAPv3 extended operations that
   provide begin-end framing, and a pair of extended operations used to
   respond the begin-end framing operations. The nature of the actual
   LDAP operations carried inside these framing operations is not
   specified in this document.

   All protocol elements described here are LDAP Version 3 extended
   operations. LDAP Version 3 is described in RFC 2251 [LDAPv3].

   Certain terms used in this document are defined in the document "LDAP
   Replication Architecture" [ARCHITECTURE].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", and "MAY" in this document are
   to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [KEYWORDS].

3. Overview

   This document describes two LDAPv3 Extended Operations that are used
   to signal the beginning and end of a set of grouped operations, and

   two LDAPv3 extended operations that are used to respond to these
   operations. These extended operations provide a framework that may be
   used when developing a protocol that requires begin-end framing.

4. Protocol element definitions

4.1 StartFramedProtocolRequest Extended Operation

   The StartFramedProtocolRequest extended operation indicates that the
   initiator wishes to begin transmission of a set of related LDAP
   operations. The requestValue of the StartFramedProtocolRequest
   extended operation contains an OID that describes the specific framed
   protocol being initiated, and a protocol-specific payload.

   An LDAPv3 Extended Request is defined in [LDAPv3] as follows:

      ExtendedRequest ::= [APPLICATION 23] SEQUENCE {
          requestName    [0] LDAPOID,
          requestValue   [1] OCTET STRING OPTIONAL
      }

   The requestName portion of the StartFramedProtocolRequest must be the
   OID "2.16.840.1.113719.1.142.100.1".

   The requestValue of the StartFramedProtocolRequest must be set to the
   BER-encoding of the following:

      StartFramedProtocolRequestValue ::= SEQUENCE {
                framedProtocolOID LDAPOID,
                framedProtocolPayload OPTIONAL OCTET STRING
      }

   The parameters in the requestValue of the StartFramedProtocolRequest
   are:

      - framedProtocolOID: An OID that uniquely identifies the protocol
        framed by this operation.  - framedProtocolPayload: An octet
      string that contains protocol-specific
        information.


4.2 StartFramedProtocolResponse Extended Operation

   The StartFramedProtocolResponse extended operation is sent in
   response to a StartFramedProtocolResponse extended operation.

   An LDAPv3 Extended Response is defined in [LDAPv3] as follows:

Internet-Draft               LDUP Workgroup               March 10, 2000


      ExtendedResponse ::= [APPLICATION 24] SEQUENCE {
          COMPONENTS of LDAPResult,
          responseName  [10] LDAPOID OPTIONAL,
          response      [11] OCTET STRING OPTIONAL
      }

   The responseName of the StartFramedProtocolResponse must be the OID
   "2.16.840.1.113719.1.142.100.2".

   The response of the StartFramedProtocolResponse is set to the BER-
   encoding of a protocol-specific response.

4.3 EndFramedProtocolRequest Extended Operation

   The EndFramedProtocolRequest extended operation indicates the end a
   set of related LDAP operations. The requestValue of the
   EndFramedProtocolRequest extended operation contains a protocol-
   specific payload.

   An LDAPv3 Extended Request is defined in [LDAPv3] as follows:

      ExtendedRequest ::= [APPLICATION 23] SEQUENCE {
          requestName    [0] LDAPOID,
          requestValue   [1] OCTET STRING OPTIONAL
      }

   The requestName of the EndFramedProtocolRequest must be the OID
   "2.16.840.1.113719.1.142.100.4".

   The requestValue of the EndFramedProtocolRequest is set to the BER-
   encoding of a protocol-specific response.

4.4 EndFramedProtocolResponse Extended Operation

   The EndFramedProtocolResponse extended operation is sent in response
   to an EndFramedProtocolRequest.

   An LDAPv3 Extended Response is defined in [LDAPv3] as follows:

      ExtendedResponse ::= [APPLICATION 24] SEQUENCE {
          COMPONENTS of LDAPResult,
          responseName  [10] LDAPOID OPTIONAL,
          response      [11] OCTET STRING OPTIONAL
      }

   The responseName of the EndFramedProtocolResponse must be the OID
   "2.16.840.1.113719.1.142.100.5".

   The response of the EndFramedProtocolResponse is set to the BER-
   encoding of a protocol-specific response.
