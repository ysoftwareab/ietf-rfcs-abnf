Abstract

   This memo is an extension to the SNMP MIB.  It obsoletes RFC 1657 and
   RFC 1269.

   The origin of this memo is from RFC 1269 "Definitions of Managed
   Objects for the Border Gateway Protocol (Version 3)", which was
   updated to support BGP-4 in RFC 1657.  This memo fixes errors
   introduced when the MIB was converted to use the SNMPv2 SMI, as well

   as updates references to the current SNMP framework documents.

   This memo is intended to document deployed implementations of this
   MIB in a historical context, provide clarifications of some items and
   also note errors where the MIB fails to fully represent the BGP
   protocol.  Work is currently in progress to replace this MIB with a
   new one representing the current state of the BGP protocol and its
   extensions.

   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.  Please forward comments to
   idr@ietf.org.

1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the
   Border Gateway Protocol Version 4 or lower [BGP, BGP4APP].

   This memo obsoletes RFC 1657 and RFC 1269.


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3.  Overview

   These objects are used to control and manage a BGP-4 implementation.

   Apart from a few system-wide scalar objects, this MIB is broken into
   three tables: the BGP Peer Table, the BGP Received Path Attribute
   Table, and the BGP-4 Received Path Attribute Table.  The BGP Peer
   Table contains information about state and current activity of
   connections with the BGP peers.  The BGP Received Path Attribute
   Table contains path attributes received from all peers running BGP
   version 3 or less.  The BGP-4 Received Path Attribute Table contains
   path attributes received from all BGP-4 peers.  The actual attributes
   used in determining a route are a subset of the received attribute
   tables after local routing policy has been applied.

6.  Security Considerations

   This MIB relates to a system providing inter-domain routing.  As
   such, improper manipulation of the objects represented by this MIB
   may result in denial of service to a large number of end-users.

   There are several management objects defined in this MIB that have a
   MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects
   should be considered sensitive or vulnerable in most network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These objects include:

      +o bgpPeerAdminStatus

        Improper change of bgpPeerAdminStatus from start to stop can
        cause significant disruption of the connectivity to those
        portions of the Internet reached via the applicable remote BGP
        peer.

      +o bgpPeerConnectRetryInterval

        Improper change of this object can cause connections to be
        disrupted for extremely long time periods when otherwise they
        would be restored in a relatively short period of time.

      +o bgpPeerHoldTimeConfigured, bgpPeerKeepAliveConfigured

        Misconfiguration of these objects can make BGP sessions more
        fragile and less resilient to denial of service attacks on the
        inter-domain routing system.

      +o bgpPeerMinASOriginationInterval,
        bgpPeerMinRouteAdvertisementInterval

        Misconfiguration of these objects may adversely affect global
        Internet convergence of the routes advertised by this BGP
        speaker.  This may result in long-lived routing loops and
        blackholes for the portions of the Internet that utilize these
        routes."

   There  are  a  number  of  managed  objects  in  this MIB that
   contain sensitive information regarding the operation of a network.
   For example, a BGP peer's local and remote addresses might be
   sensitive for ISPs who want to keep interface  addresses on routers
   confidential to prevent router addresses used for a denial of service
   attack or spoofing.

   Therefore, it is important in most environments to control read
   access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of
   these object when sending them over the network via SNMP.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), there is still no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.[REF]  Specifically, the
   implementation and use of the User-based Security Model [REF] and the
   View-based Access Control Model [REF] is recommended to provide
   appropriate security controls.

   It is then an operator/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
