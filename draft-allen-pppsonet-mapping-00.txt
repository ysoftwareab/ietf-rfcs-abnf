Abstract

This Internet Draft addresses the PPP/SONET interface defined
in the IETF RFC 1619 and the standards work underway in T1X1 on 
SONET.

PPP over SONET Mapping						October 1997

ANSI accredited T1 Technical Subcommittee T1X1 is responsible for
SONET standards development documented in ANSI T1.105. This development
includes SONET rates, formats and payload mappings specifications. 
It has recently been brought to T1X1's attention the existence of 
IETF RFC 1619 that defines a mapping for IP/PPP onto SONET. Results 
from technical analyses and laboratory tests of the RFC 1619 mapping 
have led T1X1 to conclude that RFC 1619, under certain conditions, is 
not capable of providing payload transparency in SONET transport 
networks. This technical flaw is a major concern to network operators 
for it can lead to unexpected SONET transport system behavior and 
failures. These results are documented in contribution T1X1.5/97-105 
(URL ftp://ftp.t1.org/pub/t1x1/x1.5/7x151050.pdf).

As such, T1X1 is urgently developing a solution to the above noted 
technical flaw and intends to publish the IP/PPP mapping for SONET 
signals in ANSI T1.105. The target time frame for reaching technical 
consensus on this work is April 1998. 

With the intent of establishing global standards for SDH, T1X1 is also 
pursuing specification of the IP/PPP mapping for SDH signals in ITU-T 
Recommendation G.707. The target time frame for completing the G.707 
enhancement is not yet determined, but is anticipated to be as early 
as October 1998.

A T1X1.5 ad hoc meeting is scheduled for the first week in December 
(exact dates TBD) in Kansas City for addressing IP/PPP over SONET 
mapping requirements and possible solutions. IETF input is invited and 
participants can attend to submit their proposals to this meeting and 
subsequent T1X1.5 meetings. Please contact Brent Allen or Al White 
(contact information given below) for further information.
