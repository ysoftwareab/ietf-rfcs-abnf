1. Introduction

  This draft lists current MGCP extensions and the extension names they
  use in order to avoid name clashing for new extensions. Many of the
  are extensions are presently in draft form. If and when most of these
  have a permanently published reference, the enclosed lists will be
  used as the initial MGCP IANA registration information. Refer to
  Appendix B of [1] for MGCP IANA considerations.
