    Performance Analysis of IPv6 Transition Technologies for IPv4aaS
             draft-lencse-v6ops-transition-benchmarking-00

Abstract

   Several IPv6 transition technologies have been developed to provide
   customers with IPv4-as-a-Service (IPv4aaS) for ISPs with an IPv6-only
   access and/or core network.  All these technologies have their
   advantages and disadvantages, and depending on existing topology,
   skills, strategy and other preferences, one of these technologies may
   be the most appropriate solution for a network operator.

   This document examines and compares the performance of some free
   software implementations of the five most prominent IPv4aaS
   technologies (464XLAT, Dual Stack Lite, Lightweight 4over6, MAP-E,
   MAP-T).

1.  Introduction

   IETF has standardized several IPv6 transition technologies [LEN2019]
   and occupied a neutral position trusting the selection of the most
   appropriate ones to the market.
   [I-D.ietf-v6ops-transition-comparison] provides a comprehensive
   comparative analysis of the five most prominent IPv4aaS technologies
   to assist operators with this problem.  This document adds one more
   detail: performance analysis and comparison of the examined IPv4aaS
   technologies.

   Currently this document is a stub.  It has been created to provide a
   citable reference for the above mentioned I-D.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.
