1.  Introduction

   The purpose of this draft is to define an architectural approach for
   a SACM Domain, based on the spirit of use cases found in [RFC7632]
   and requirements found in [RFC8248].  This approach gains the most
   advantage by supporting a variety of collection systems, and intends
   to enable a cooperative ecosystem of tools from disparate sources
   with minimal operator configuration.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119, BCP 14 [RFC2119].

2.  Terms and Definitions

   This draft defers to [I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology] for terms and
   definitions.

3.  Architectural Overview

   The generic approach proposed herein recognizes the need to obtain
   information from existing and future state collection systems, and
   makes every attempt to respect [RFC7632] and [RFC8248].  At the
   foundation of any architecture are entities, or components, that need
   to communicate.  They communicate by sharing information, where, in a
   given flow, one or more components are consumers of information and
   one or more components are providers of information.

                      Figure 1: Notional Architecture

   As shown in Figure 1, the SACM architecture consists of some basic
   SACM Components communicating using a component integration service.
   The component integration service is expected to maximally align with
   the requirements described in [RFC8248], which means that the
   component integration service will support brokered (i.e. point-to-
   point) and proxied data exchange.

   The enterprise boundary is not intended to imply a physical boundary.
   Rather, the enterprise boundary is intended to be inclusive of
   various cloud environments and vendor-provided services in addition
   to any physical systems the enterprise operates.

3.1.  Architectural Components

   This document suggests a variety of players in a cooperative
   ecosystem - we call these players SACM Components.  SACM Components
   may be composed of other SACM Components, and each SACM Component
   plays one, or more, of several roles relevant to the ecosystem.
   Generally each role is either a consumer of information or a provider
   of information.  The Figure 1 diagram illustrates a number of SACM



Montville & Munyan        Expires March 9, 2020                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft              SACM Architecture             September 2019


   components which are architecturally significant and therefore
   warrant discussion and clarification.

3.1.1.  Orchestrator

   An Orchestration component exists to aid in the automation of
   configuration, coordination, and management for the ecosystem of SACM
   components.  The Orchestrator performs control-plane operations,
   administration of an implementing organization's components
   (including endpoints, posture collection services, and downstream
   activities), scheduling of automated tasks, and any ad-hoc activities
   such as the initiation of collection or evaluation activities.  The
   Orchestrator is the key administrative interface into the SACM
   architecture.

3.1.2.  Repositories/CMDBs

   The Figure 1 diagram only includes a single reference to
   "Repositories/CMDBs", but in practice, a number of separate data
   repositories may exist, including posture attribute repositories,
   policy repositories, local vulnerability definition data
   repositories, and state assessment results repositories.  These data
   repositories may exist separately or together in a single
   representation, and the design of these repositories may be as
   distinct as their intended purpose, such as the use of relational
   database management systems or graph/map implementations focused on
   the relationships between data elements.  Each implementation of a
   SACM repository should focus on the relationships between data
   elements and implement the SACM information and data model(s).

3.1.3.  Component Integration Service

   If each SACM component represents a set of services, capabilities,
   and/or functions, the Component Integration Service represents the
   "fabric" by which all those services, capabilities and functions are
   woven together.  The Component Integration Service acts as a message
   broker, combining a canonical data model, a common command set, and a
   messaging infrastructure to allow other SACM components to
   communicate using a shared set of interfaces.  The Component
   Integration Service's brokering capabilities enable the exchange of
   information, the orchestration of capabilities, message routing and
   reliable delivery.  The Component Integration Service minimizes the
   dependencies from one system to another through the loose coupling of
   applications through messaging.

   The Component Integration Service should provide mechanisms for
   synchronous "request/response"-style messaging, asynchronous "send
   and forget" messaging, or publish/subscribe.  It is the

Internet-Draft              SACM Architecture             September 2019


   responsibility of the Component Integration Service to coordinate and
   manage the sending and receiving of messages.  The Component
   Integration Service should allow components the ability to directly
   connect and produce or consume messages, or connect via message
   translators which can act as a proxy, transforming messages from a
   component format to one implementing a SACM data model.

   A number of pieces come together to form the Component Integration
   Service:

   1.  Common communication infrastructure: The physical communications
       infrastructure, providing a cross-platform, cross-language
       universal adapter between SACM components.  This infrastructure
       commonly includes message routing capabilities to facilitate the
       correct routing of messages from SACM component to SACM
       component, as well as using Publish/Subscribe functionality to
       facilitate sending messages to all receivers.

   2.  Adapters: The use of a standard, canonical data model will likely
       require SACM components to translate component-specific
       information into the canonical format used by the message broker.

   3.  Common command/interaction structure: Just as PC architectures
       have a common set of commands to represent the different
       operations possible on a physical bus, there must be common
       interactions that all SACM components can understand.

3.2.  Sub-Architectures

   The Figure 1 shows two components representing the architectural
   workflows involved in a cooperative ecosystem of SACM components:
   Collection and Evaluation.  The following section, Architectural
   Workflows (TBD - ADD LINK) further expands on these components/
   workflows.

3.3.  Downstream Uses

   As depicted by Figure 1, a number of downstream uses exist in the
   cooperative ecosystem.  Each notional SACM component represents
   distinct sub-architectures which will exchange information via the
   component integration services, using interactions described in this
   draft.

3.3.1.  Reporting

   The Reporting component represents the capabilities of the SACM
   architecture dealing with the query and retrieval of collected

Internet-Draft              SACM Architecture             September 2019


   posture attribute information, evaluation results, etc. in various
   display formats that are useful to a wide range of stakeholders.

3.3.2.  Analytics

   The Analytics component represents the capabilities of the SACM
   architecture dealing with the discovery, interpretation, and
   communication of any meaningful patterns of data in order to inform
   effective decision making within the organization.

4.  Sub-Architectural Components

   This section describes the workflows derived from the interactions
   with the two sub-architectures depicted in the Figure 1: Collection
   and Evaluation.

4.1.  Collection Sub-Architecture

   The Collection sub-architecture, in a SACM context, is the mechanism
   by which posture attributes are collected from applicable endpoints
   and persisted to a repository, such as a configuration management
   database (CMDB).  Orchestration components will choreograph endpoint
   data collection via interactions using the Component Integration
   Service as a message broker.  Instructions to perform endpoint data
   collection are directed to a Posture Collection Service capable of
   performing collection activities utilizing any number of methods,
   such as SNMP, NETCONF/RESTCONF, SSH, WinRM, or host-based.

4.1.1.  Posture Collection Service

   The Posture Collection Service (PCS) is the SACM component
   responsible for the collection of posture attributes from an endpoint
   or set of endpoints.  A single PCS may be responsible for management
   of posture attribute collection from many endpoints.  The PCS will
   interact with the Component Integration Service to receive collection
   instructions and to provide collected posture data for persistence to
   the Posture Attribute Repository.  Collection instructions may be
   supplied in a variety of forms, including subscription to a publish/
   subscribe topic to which the Component Integration Service has

   published instructions, via request/response-style synchronous
   messaging, or via asynchronous "send-and-forget" messaging.
   Collected posture information may then be supplied to the Component
   Integration Service via similar channels.  The various interaction
   types are discussed later in this draft (TBD).

4.1.2.  Endpoint

   Building upon [I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology], the SACM Collection Sub-
   Architecture augments the definition of an Endpoint as a component
   within an organization's management domain from which a Posture
   Collection Service will collect relevant posture attributes.

4.1.3.  Posture Attribute Repository

   The Posture Attribute Repository is a SACM component responsible for
   the persistent storage of posture attributes collected via
   interactions between the Posture Collection Service and Endpoints.

4.2.  Evaluation Sub-Architecture

   The Evaluation Sub-Architecture, in the SACM context, is the
   mechanism by which policy, expressed in the form of expected state,
   is compared with collected posture attributes to yield an evaluation
   result, that result being contextually dependent on the policy being
   evaluated.

4.2.1.  Posture Evaluation Service

   The Posture Evaluation Service represents the SACM component
   responsible for coordinating the policy to be evaluated and the
   collected posture attributes relevant to that policy, as well as the
   comparison engine responsible for correctly determining compliance
   with the expected state.

4.2.2.  Policy Repository

   The Policy Repository represents a persistent storage mechanism for
   the policy to be assessed against collected posture attributes to
   determine if an endpoint meets the defined expected state.  Examples

   of information contained in a Policy Repository would be
   Vulnerability Definition Data or configuration recommendations as
   part of a CIS Benchmark or DISA STIG.

4.2.3.  Evaluation Results Repository

   The Evaluation Results Repository persists the information
   representing the results of a particular posture assessment,
   indicating those posture attributes collected from various endpoints
   which either meet or do not meet the expected state defined by the
   assessed policy.  Consideration should be made for the context of
   individual results.  For example, meeting the expected state for a
   configuration attribute indicates a correct configuration of the
   endpoint, whereas meeting an expected state for a vulnerable software
   version indicates an incorrect and therefore vulnerable
   configuration.

5.  Interactions

   SACM Components are intended to interact with other SACM Components.
   These interactions can be thought of, at the level of this
   architectural approach, as the combination of interfaces with their
   supported operations.  Each interaction will convey a payload of
   information.  The payload information is expected to contain sub-
   domain-specific characteristics and instructions.

   o  *Publish/Subscribe*: A component publishes information to a
      messaging system and a set of other components, subscribed to that
      information type, receive the published information.

   o  *Request/Response*: A request/response interaction can take a
      number of forms, but will always be synchronous operations
      involving the requesting component waiting/blocking until a
      response is received from the requested component or a timeout
      occurs.

      *  *Information Request*: An information request is simply one
         component requesting information from another component, such
         as an Orchestrator requesting collection capabilities from a
         Posture Collection Service.

      *  *Query*: A query interaction can take one of two forms,
         "selection" or "storage".

         +  _Selection_: A component requests data from a repository.

         +  _Storage_: A component provides data to be persisted in a
            repository.

   o  *Directive*: Commonly referred to as "Send-and-Forget", a
      directive is an asynchronous interaction whereby a component
      requests information from another component but does not wait/
      block for a response.  The receiving component may reply later via
      callbacks or further interactions, but it is not mandatory.

   Each interaction will convey a payload of information.  The payload
   information is expected to contain sub-domain-specific
   characteristics and instructions.

6.  Security Domain Workflows

   This section describes three primary information security domains
   from which workflows may be derived: IT Asset Management,
   Vulnerability Management, and Configuration Management.

6.1.  IT Asset Management

   Information Technology asset management is easier said than done.
   The [CISCONTROLS] have two controls dealing with IT asset management.
   Control 1, Inventory and Control of Hardware Assets, states,
   "Actively manage (inventory, track, and correct) all hardware devices
   on the network so that only authorized devices are given access, and
   unauthorized and unmanaged devices are found and prevented from
   gaining access."  Control 2, Inventory and Control of Software
   Assets, states, "Actively manage (inventory, track, and correct) all
   software on the network so that only authorized software is installed
   and can execute, and that unauthorized and unmanaged software is
   found and prevented from installation or execution."

   In spirit, this covers all of the processing entities on your network
   (as opposed to things like network cables, dongles, adapters, etc.),
   whether physical or virtual.

   An IT asset management capability needs to be able to:

   o  Identify and catalog new assets by executing Target Endpoint
      Discovery Tasks

   o  Provide information about its managed assets, including uniquely
      identifying information (for that enterprise)

   o  Handle software and/or hardware (including virtual assets)

   o  Represent cloud hybrid environments

Internet-Draft              SACM Architecture             September 2019


6.2.  Vulnerability Management

   Vulnerability management is a relatively established process.  To
   paraphrase the [CISCONTROLS], continuous vulnerability management is
   the act of continuously acquiring, assessing, and taking subsequent
   action on new information in order to identify and remediate
   vulnerabilities, therefore minimizing the window of opportunity for
   attackers.

   A vulnerability assessment (i.e. vulnerability detection) is
   performed in two steps:

   o  Endpoint information collected by the endpoint management
      capabilities is examined by the vulnerability management
      capabilities through Evaluation Tasks.

   o  If the data possessed by the endpoint management capabilities is
      insufficient, a Collection Task is triggered and the necessary
      data is collected from the target endpoint.

   Vulnerability detection relies on the examination of different
   endpoint information depending on the nature of a specific
   vulnerability.  Common endpoint information used to detect a
   vulnerability includes:

   o  A specific software version is installed on the endpoint

   o  File system attributes

   o  Specific state attributes

   In some cases, the endpoint information needed to determine an
   endpoint's vulnerability status will have been previously collected
   by the endpoint management capabilities and available in a
   Repository.  However, in other cases, the necessary endpoint
   information will not be readily available in a Repository and a
   Collection Task will be triggered to perform collection from the
   target endpoint.  Of course, some implementations of endpoint
   management capabilities may prefer to enable operators to perform
   this collection even when sufficient information can be provided by
   the endpoint management capabilities (e.g. there may be freshness
   requirements for information).

6.3.  Configuration Management

   Configuration management involves configuration assessment, which
   requires state assessment.  The [CISCONTROLS] specify two high-level
   controls concerning configuration management (Control 5 for non-



Montville & Munyan        Expires March 9, 2020                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft              SACM Architecture             September 2019


   network devices and Control 11 for network devices).  As an aside,
   these controls are listed separately because many enterprises have
   different organizations for managing network infrastructure and
   workload endpoints.  Merging the two controls results in the
   following paraphrasing: Establish, implement, and actively manage
   (track, report on, correct) the security configuration of systems
   using a rigorous configuration management and change control process
   in order to prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerable services and
   settings.

   Typically, an enterprise will use configuration guidance from a
   reputable source, and from time to time they may tailor the guidance
   from that source prior to adopting it as part of their enterprise
   standard.  The enterprise standard is then provided to the
   appropriate configuration assessment tools and they assess endpoints
   and/or appropriate endpoint information.

   A preferred flow follows:

   o  Reputable source publishes new or updated configuration guidance

   o  Enterprise configuration assessment capability retrieves
      configuration guidance from reputable source

   o  Optional: Configuration guidance is tailored for enterprise-
      specific needs

   o  Configuration assessment tool queries asset inventory repository
      to retrieve a list of affected endpoints

   o  Configuration assessment tool queries configuration state
      repository to evaluate compliance

   o  If information is stale or unavailable, configuration assessment
      tool triggers an ad hoc assessment

   The SACM architecture needs to support varying deployment models to
   accommodate the current state of the industry, but should strongly
   encourage event-driven approaches to monitoring configuration.

7.  Configuration Management Components and Capabilities

   This section provides more detail about the components and
   capabilities required when considering the aforementioned
   configuration management workflow.

Internet-Draft              SACM Architecture             September 2019


7.1.  Components

   The following is a minimal list of SACM Components required to
   implement the aforementioned configuration assessment workflow.

   o  Configuration Policy Feed: An external source of authoritative
      configuration recommendations.

   o  Configuration Policy Repository: An internal repository of
      enterprise standard configurations.

   o  Configuration Assessment Orchestrator: A component responsible for
      orchestrating assessments.

   o  Posture Attribute Collection Subsystem: A component responsible
      for collection of posture attributes from systems.

   o  Posture Attribute Repository: A component used for storing system
      posture attribute values.

   o  Configuration Assessment Evaluator: A component responsible for
      evaluating system posture attribute values against expected
      posture attribute values.

   o  Configuration Assessment Results Repository: A component used for
      storing evaluation results.

7.2.  Capabilities

   Per [RFC8248], solutions MUST support capability negotiation.
   Components implementing specific interfaces and operations (i.e.
   interactions) will need a method of describing their capabilities to
   other components participating in the ecosystem; for example, "As a
   component in the ecosystem, I can assess the configuration of
   Windows, MacOS, and AWS using OVAL".

8.  Configuration Assessment Workflow

   This section describes the components and interactions in a basic
   configuration assessment workflow.  For simplicity, error conditions
   are recognized as being necessary and are not depicted.  When one
   component messages another component, the message is expected to be
   handled appropriately unless there is an error condition, or other
   notification, messaged in return.

   Figure 4 depicts configuration assessment components and their
   interactions, which are further described below.

   1.  Policy is stored in the Policy Repository: TODO - add specific
       interaction options here.

   2.  The Orchestrator obtains collection information from the Policy
       Repository: TODO - add specific interaction options here.

   3.  The Orchestrator initiates collection to be performed by the
       Collection Sub-Architecture: TODO - add specific interaction
       options here.

   4.  Collected posture attributes are stored n the Posture Attribute
       Repository: TODO - add specific interaction options here.

   5.  The Orchestrator initiates the Evaluator (optionally with
       evaluation information gathered from the Policy Repository): TODO
       - add specific interaction options here

       1.  The Evaluator obtains evaluation information from the Policy
           Repository (optionally): TODO - add specific interaction
           options here

       2.  The Evaluator obtains relevant posture attributes from the
           Posture Attribute Repository: TODO - add specific interaction
           options here

   6.  Evaluation results are stored in the Evaluation Results
       Repository: TODO - add specific interaction options here

   In the above flow, the payload information is expected to convey the
   context required by the receiving component for the action being
   taken under different circumstances.  For example, the Tell message
   sent from an Orchestrator to a Collection sub-architecture might be
   telling that Collector to watch a specific posture attribute and
   report only specific detected changes to the Posture Attribute
   Repository, or it might be telling the Collector to gather that
   posture attribute immediately.  Such details are expected to be
   handled as part of that payload, not as part of the architecture
   described herein.

9.  Privacy Considerations

   TODO

10.  Security Considerations

   TODO

11.  IANA Considerations

   TODO: Revamp this section after the configuration assessment workflow
   is fleshed out.

   IANA tables can probably be used to make life a little easier.  We
   would like a place to enumerate:

   o  Capability/operation semantics

   o  SACM Component implementation identifiers

   o  SACM Component versions

   o  Associations of SACM Components (and versions) to specific
      Capabilities

   o  Collection sub-architecture Identification

   o  XEP-nnnn: The requirement is satisfied by a numbered XMPP
      extension (see [XMPPEXT])

   o  Operational: The requirement is an operational concern or can be
      addressed by an operational deployment

   o  Implementation: The requirement is an implementation concern

Appendix B.  Example Components

   TODO: Consider removing.

B.1.  Policy Services

   Consider a policy server conforming to [RFC8322].  [RFC8322]
   describes a RESTful way based on the ATOM Publishing Protocol
   ([RFC5023]) to find specific data collections.  While this represents
   a specific binding (i.e.  RESTful API based on [RFC5023]), there is a
   more abstract way to look at ROLIE.

   ROLIE provides notional workspaces and collections, and provides the
   concept of information categories and links.  Strictly speaking,
   these are logical concepts independent of the RESTful binding ROLIE
   specifies.  In other words, ROLIE binds a logical interface (i.e.
   GET workspace, GET collection, SET entry, and so on) to a specific
   mechanism (namely an ATOM Publication Protocol extension).

   It is not inconceivable to believe there could be a different
   interface mechanism, or a connector, providing these same operations
   using XMPP-Grid as the transfer mechanism.

   Even if a [RFC8322] server were external to an organization, there
   would be a need for a policy source inside the organization as well,

   and it may be preferred for such a policy source to be connected
   directly to the ecosystem's communication infrastructure.

B.2.  Software Inventory

   The SACM working group has accepted work on the Endpoint Posture
   Collection Profile [I-D.ietf-sacm-ecp], which describes a collection
   architecture and may be viewed as a collector coupled with a
   collection-specific repository.

                  Figure 5: EPCP Collection Architecture

   In Figure 5, any of the communications between the Posture Manager
   and EPCP components to its left could be performed directly or
   indirectly using a given message transfer mechanism.  For example,
   the pub/sub interface between the Orchestrator and the Posture
   Manager could be using a proprietary method or using [RFC8600] or
   some other pub/sub mechanism.  Similarly, the store connection from
   the Posture Manager to the Repository could be performed internally
   to a given implementation, via a RESTful API invocation over HTTPS,
   or even over a pub/sub mechanism.

   Our assertion is that the Evaluator, Repository, Orchestrator, and
   Posture Manager all have the potential to represent SACM Components
   with specific capability interfaces that can be logically specified,
   then bound to one or more specific transfer mechanisms (i.e.  RESTful
   API, [RFC8322], [RFC8600], and so on).

B.3.  Datastream Collection

   [NIST800126], also known as SCAP 1.3, provides the technical
   specifications for a "datastream collection".  The specification
   describes the "datastream collection" as being "composed of SCAP data
   streams and SCAP source components".  A "datastream" provides an
   encapsulation of the SCAP source components required to, for example,
   perform configuration assessment on a given endpoint.  These source
   components include XCCDF checklists, OVAL Definitions, and CPE
   Dictionary information.  A single "datastream collection" may
   encapsulate multiple "datastreams", and reference any number of SCAP
   components.  Datastream collections were intended to provide an
   envelope enabling transfer of SCAP data more easily.

   The [NIST800126] specification also defines the "SCAP result data
   stream" as being conformant to the Asset Reporting Format
   specification, defined in [NISTIR7694].  The Asset Reporting Format
   provides an encapsulation of the SCAP source components, Asset
   Information, and SCAP result components, such as system
   characteristics and state evaluation results.

   What [NIST800126]did not do is specify the interface for finding or
   acquiring source datastream information, nor an interface for
   publishing result information.  Discovering the actual resources for
   this information could be done via ROLIE, as described in the Policy
   Services section above, but other repositories of SCAP data exist as
   well.

B.4.  Network Configuration Collection

   [draft-birkholz-sacm-yang-content] illustrates a SACM Component
   incorporating a YANG Push client function and an XMPP-grid publisher
   function. [draft-birkholz-sacm-yang-content] further states "the
   output of the YANG Push client function is encapsulated in a SACM
   Content Element envelope, which is again encapsulated in a SACM
   statement envelope" which are published, essentially, via an XMPP-
   Grid Connector for SACM Components also part of the XMPP-Grid.

   This is a specific example of an existing collection mechanism being
   adapted to the XMPP-Grid message transfer system.

Appendix C.  Exploring An XMPP-based Solution

   TODO: Consider removing or placing in a separate draft.

   Ongoing work has been taking place around and during IETF hackathons.
   The list of hackathon efforts follows:

Internet-Draft              SACM Architecture             September 2019


   o  [HACK99]: A partial implementation of a vulnerability assessment
      scenario involving an [I-D.ietf-sacm-ecp] implementation, a
      [RFC8322] implementation, and a proprietary evaluator to pull the
      pieces together.

   o  [HACK100]: Work to combine the vulnerability assessment scenario
      from [HACK99] with an XMPP-based YANG push model.

   o  [HACK101]: A fully automated configuration assessment
      implementation using XMPP (specifically Publish/Subscribe
      capabilities) as a communication mechanism.

   o  [HACK102]: An exploration of how we might model assessment,
      collection, and evaluation abstractly, and then rely on YANG
      expressions for the attributes of traditional endpoints.

   o  [HACK103]: No SACM participation at the Bangkok hackathon.

   o  [HACK104]: Basic XMPP-to-Concise MAP - Created an XMPP adapter
      that can accept basic posture attributes and translate them to
      Concise MAP.  This hackathon only proved the concept that system
      characteristics information can be transported via XMPP and
      translated to a (very basic) concise MAP implementation.

   o  [HACK105]: Advanced XMPP-to-Concise MAP: Full orchestration of
      collection capabilities using XMPP.  Collector implementations
      extend the core XMPP structure to allow OVAL collection
      instructions (OVAL objects) to inform posture attribute
      collection.  Collected system characteristics can be provided to
      the Concise MAP XMPP adapter using all 3 available XMPP
      capabilities: Publish/Subscribe, Information Query (iq - request/
      response) stanzas, or direct Message stanzas.  CDDL was created to
      map collected posture attributes to Concise MAP structure.  The
      XMPP adapter translates the incoming system characteristics and
      stores the information in the MAP.

   Figure 6 depicts a slightly more detailed view of the architecture
   (within the enterprise boundary) - one that fosters the development
   of a pluggable ecosystem of cooperative tools.  Existing collection
   mechanisms can be brought into this architecture by specifying the
   interface of the collector and creating the XMPP-Grid Connector
   binding for that interface.

   Additionally, while not directly depicted in Figure 6, this
   architecture does allow point-to-point interfaces.  In fact,
   [RFC8600] provides brokering capabilities to facilitate such point-
   to-point data transfers).  Additionally, each of the SACM Components

   depicted in Figure 6 may be a provider, a consumer, or both,
   depending on the workflow in context.

                     Figure 6: XMPP-based Architecture

   [RFC8600] details a number of XMPP extensions (XEPs) that MUST be
   utilized to meet the needs of [RFC7632] and [RFC8248]:

   o  Service Discovery (XEP-0030): Service Discovery allows XMPP
      entities to discover information about other XMPP entities.  Two
      kinds of information can be discovered: the identity and
      capabilities of an entity, such as supported features, and items
      associated with an entity.

   o  Publish-Subscribe (XEP-0060): The PubSub extension enables
      entities to create nodes (topics) at a PubSub service and publish
      information at those nodes.  Once published, an event notification
      is broadcast to all entities that have subscribed to that node.

   At this point, [RFC8600] specifies fewer features than SACM requires,
   and there are other XMPP extensions (XEPs) we need to consider to
   meet the needs of [RFC7632] and [RFC8248].  In Figure 6 we therefore
   use "XMPP-Grid+" to indicate something more than [RFC8600] alone,
   even though we are not yet fully confident in the exact set of XMPP-
   related extensions we will require.  The authors propose work to
   extend (or modify) [RFC8600] to include additional XEPs - possibly
   the following:

Internet-Draft              SACM Architecture             September 2019


   o  Entity Capabilities (XEP-0115): This extension defines the methods
      for broadcasting and dynamically discovering an entities'
      capabilities.  This information is transported via standard XMPP
      presence.  Example capabilities that could be discovered could
      include support for posture attribute collection, support for
      specific types of posture attribute collection such as EPCP,
      SWIMA, OVAL, or YANG.  Other capabilities are still to be
      determined.

   o  Ad Hoc Commands (XEP-0050): This extension allows an XMPP entity
      to advertise and execute application-specific commands.  Typically
      the commands contain data forms (XEP-0004) in order to structure
      the information exchange.  This extension may be usable for simple
      orchestration (i.e. "do assessment").

   o  HTTP File Upload (XEP-0363): The HTTP File Upload extension allows
      for large data sets to be published to a specific path on an HTTP
      server, and receive a URL from which that file can later be
      downloaded again.  XMPP messages and IQs are meant to be compact,
      and large data sets, such as collected posture attributes, may
      exceed a message size threshold.  Usage of this XEP allows those
      larger data sets to be persisted, thus necessitating only the
      download URL to be passed via XMPP messages.

   o  Personal Eventing Protocol (XEP-0163): The Personal Eventing
      Protocol can be thought of as a virtual PubSub service, allowing
      an XMPP account to publish events only to their roster instead of
      a generic PubSub topic.  This XEP may be useful in the cases when
      collection requests or queries are only intended for a subset of
      endpoints and not an entire subscriber set.

   o  File Repository and Sharing (XEP-0214): This extension defines a
      method for XMPP entities to designate a set of file available for
      retrieval by other users of their choosing, and is based on PubSub
      Collections.

   o  Easy User Onboarding (XEP-401): The goal of this extension is
      simplified client registration, and may be useful when adding new
      endpoints or SACM components to the ecosystem.

   o  Bidirectional-streams Over Synchronous HTTP (BOSH) (XEP-0124):
      BOSH emulates the semantics of a long-lived, bidirectional TCP
      connection between two entities (aka "long polling").  Consider a
      SACM component that is updated dynamically, i.e. an internal
      vulnerability definition repository ingesting data from a Feed/
      Repository of External Data, and a second SACM component such as
      an Orchestrator.  Using BOSH, the Orchestrator can effectively

Internet-Draft              SACM Architecture             September 2019


      continuously poll the vulnerability definition repository for
      changes/updates.

   o  PubSub Collection Nodes (XEP-0248): Effectively an extension to
      XEP-0060 (Publish-Subscribe), PubSub Collections aim to simplify
      an entities' subscription to multiple related topics, and
      establishes a "node graph" relating parent nodes to its
      descendents.  An example "node graph" could be rooted in a
      "vulnerability definitions" topic, and contain descendent topics
      for OS family-level vulnerability definitions (i.e.  Windows), and
      further for OS family version-level definitions (i.e.  Windows 10
      or Windows Server 2016).

   o  PubSub Since (XEP-0312): This extension enables a subscriber to
      automatically receive PubSub and Personal Eventing Protocol (PEP)
      notifications since its last logout time.  This extension may be
      useful in intermittent connection scenarios, or when entities
      disconnect and reconnect to the ecosystem.

   o  PubSub Chaining (XEP-0253): This extension describes the
      federation of publishing nodes, enabling a publish node of one
      server to be a subscriber to a publishing node of another server.

C.1.  Example Architecture using XMPP-Grid and Endpoint Posture
      Collection Protocol

   Figure 7 depicts a further detailed view of the architecture
   including the Endpoint Posture Collection Protocol as the collection
   subsystem, illustrating the idea of a pluggable ecosystem of
   cooperative tools.
