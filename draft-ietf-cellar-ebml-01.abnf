   The ""*"", ""("" and "")"" symbols MUST be interpreted as they are
   defined in the ABNF.

   The "EBMLPathAtom" part of the "EBMLElementPath" MUST be equal to the
   "name" attribute of the "EBML Schema".

   The starting "PathDelimiter" of the path corresponds to the root of
   the "EBML Document".

   The "EBMLElementOccurence" part is interpreted as an ABNF Variable
   Repetition.  The repetition amounts correspond to how many times the
   "EBML Element" can be found in its parent "Parent Element".

   The "EBMLMinOccurence" represents the minimum number of occurrences
   of this "EBML Element" within its "Parent Element".  Each instance of
   the "Parent Element" MUST contain at least this many instances of
   this "EBML Element".  If the "EBML Element" has an empty
   "EBMLParentPath" then "EBMLMinOccurence" refers to constaints on the
   occurrence of the "EBML Element" within the "EBML Document".  If
   "EBMLMinOccurence" is not present then that "EBML Element" is
   considered to have a "EBMLMinOccurence" value of 0.  The semantic
   meaning of "EBMLMinOccurence" within an "EBML Schema" is considered
   analogous to the meaning of "minOccurs" within an "XML Schema".
   "EBML Elements" with "EBMLMinOccurence" set to "1" that also have a
   "default" value (see Section 11.1.4.8) declared are not REQUIRED to
   be stored but are REQUIRED to be interpreted, see Section 11.1.11.
   An "EBML Element" defined with a "EBMLMinOccurence" value greater
   than zero is called a "Mandatory EBML Element".
   The "EBMLMaxOccurence" represents the maximum number of occurrences
   of this "EBML Element" within its "Parent Element".  Each instance of
   the "Parent Element" MUST contain at most this many instances of this
   "EBML Element".  If the "EBML Element" has an empty "EBMLParentPath"
   then "EBMLMaxOccurence" refers to constaints on the occurrence of the
   "EBML Element" within the "EBML Document".  If "EBMLMaxOccurence" is
   not present then that "EBML Element" is considered to have an
   unbounded "EBMLMaxOccurence" value.  The semantic meaning of
   "EBMLMaxOccurence" within an "EBML Schema path" is considered
   analogous to the meaning of "maxOccurs" within an "XML Schema".

   The "VariableParentOccurence" part is interpreted as an ABNF Variable
   Repetition.  The repetition amounts correspond to the amount of
   unspecified "Parent Element" levels there can be between the
   "EBMLFixedParent" and the actual "EBMLElementPath".

   If the path contains a "EBMLPathAtomRecursive" part, the "EBML
   Element" can occur within itself recursively (see the
   Section 11.1.4.11).
