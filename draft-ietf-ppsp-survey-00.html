  <h1 id="rfc.section.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> Introduction</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">Toward standardizing the signaling protocols used in today's Peer-to-Peer (P2P) streaming applications, we surveyed several popular P2P streaming systems regarding their architectures and signaling protocols between peers, as well as, between peers and trackers. The studied P2P streaming systems, running worldwide or domestically, include such as PPLive, Joost, Cybersky-TV, and Octoshape. This document does not intend to cover all design options of P2P streaming applications. Instead, we choose a representative set of applications and focus on the respective signaling characteristics of each kind.  Through the survey, we generalize a common streaming process model from those P2P streaming systems, and summarize the companion signaling process as the base for P2P Streaming Protocol (PPSP) standardization.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> Terminologies and concepts</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">Chunk: A chunk is a basic unit of partitioned streaming media, which is used by a peer for the purpose of storage, advertisement and exchange among peers [Sigcomm:P2P streaming].</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.2">Content Distribution Network (CDN) node: A CDN node refers to a network entity that usually is deployed at the network edge to store content provided by the original servers, and serves content to the clients located nearby topologically.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.3">Live streaming: The scenario where all clients receive streaming content for the same ongoing event. The lags between the play points of the clients and that of the streaming source are small..</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.4">P2P cache: A P2P cache refers to a network entity that caches P2P traffic in the network, and either transparently or explicitly distributes content to other peers.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.5">P2P streaming protocols: P2P streaming protocols refer to multiple protocols such as streaming control, resource discovery, streaming data transport, etc. which are needed to build a P2P streaming system.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.6">Peer/PPSP peer: A peer/PPSP peer refers to a participant in a P2P streaming system. The participant not only receives streaming content, but also stores and uploads streaming content to other participants.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.7">PPSP protocols: PPSP protocols refer to the key signaling protocols among various P2P streaming system components, including the tracker and peers.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.8">Swarm: A swarm refers to a group of clients (i.e. peers) sharing the same content (e.g. video/audio program, digital file, etc) at a given time.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.9">Tracker/PPSP tracker: A tracker/PPSP tracker refers to a directory service which maintains the lists of peers/PPSP peers storing chunks for a specific channel or streaming file, and answers queries from peers/PPSP peers.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.10">Video-on-demand (VoD): A kind of application that allows users to select and watch video content on demand</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.3">3.</a> Survey of P2P streaming system</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">In this section, we summarize some existing P2P streaming systems.  The construction techniques used in these systems can be largely classified into two categories: tree-based and mesh-based structures.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.2">Tree-based structure: Group members self-organize into a tree structure, based on which group management and data delivery is performed. Such structure and push-based content delivery have small maintenance cost and good scalability and low delay in retrieving the content(associated with startup delay) and can be easily implemented.  However, it may result in low bandwidth usage and less reliability.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.3">Mesh-based structure: In contrast to tree-based structure, a mesh uses multiple links between any two nodes. Thus, the reliability of data transmission is relatively high. Besides, multiple links results in high bandwidth usage. Nevertheless, the cost of maintaining such mesh is much larger than that of a tree, and pull-based content delivery lead to high overhead associated each video block transmission, in particular the delay in retrieving the content.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.4">Hybrid structure: Combine tree-based and mesh-based structure, combine pull-based and push-based content delivery to utilize the advantages of two structures. It has high reliability as much as mesh-based structure, lower delay than mesh-based structure, lower overhead associated each video block transmission and high topology maintenance cost as much as mesh-based structure.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.1">3.1.</a> Mesh-based P2P streaming systems</h1>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.1.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.1.1">3.1.1.</a> Joost</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.1.p.1">Joost announced to give up P2P technology on its desktop version last year, though it introduced a flash version for browsers and iPhone application. The key reason why Joost shut down its desktop version is probably the legal issues of provided media content.  However, as one of the most popular P2P VoD application in the past years, it's worthwhile to understand how Joost works. The peer management and data transmission in Joost mainly relies on mesh-based structure.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.1.p.2">The three key components of Joost are servers, super nodes and peers. There are five types of servers: Tracker server, Version server, Backend server, Content server and Graphics server. The architecture of Joost system is shown in Figure 1.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.1.p.3">First, we introduce the functionalities of Joost's key components through three basic phases. Then we will discuss the Peer protocol and Tracker protocol of Joost.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.1.p.4">Installation: Backend server is involved in the installation phase. Backend server provides peer with an initial channel list in a SQLite file. No other parameters, such as local cache, node ID, or listening port, are configured in this file.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.1.p.5">Bootstrapping: In case of a newcomer, Tracker server provides several super node addresses and possibly some content server addresses. Then the peer connects Version server for the latest software version. Later, the peer starts to connect some super nodes to obtain the list of other available peers and begins streaming video contents. Different from Skype [skype], super nodes in Joost only deal with control and peer management traffic. They do not relay/forward any media data.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.1.p.6">Channel switching: Super nodes are responsible for redirecting clients to content server or peers.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.1.p.7">Peers communicate with servers over HTTP/HTTPs and with super nodes/other peers over UDP.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.1.p.8">Tracker Protocol: Because super nodes here are responsible for providing the peerlist/content servers to peers, protocol used between tracker server and peers is rather simple. Peers get the addresses of super nodes and content servers from Tracker Server over HTTP. After that, Tracker sever will not appear in any stage, e.g. channel switching, VoD interaction. In fact, the protocol spoken between peers and super nodes is more like what we normally called "Tracker Protocol". It enables super nodes to check peer status, maintain peer lists for several, if not all, channels. It provides peer list/content servers to peers. Thus, in the rest of this section, when we mention Tracker Protocol, we mean the one used between peers and super nodes.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.1.p.9">Peers will communicate with super nodes in some scenarios using Tracker Protocol.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.1.p.10">1. When a peer starts Joost software, after the installation and bootstrapping, the peer will communicate with one or several super nodes to get a list of available peers/content servers.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.1.p.11">2. For on-demand video functions, super nodes periodically exchange small UDP packets for peer management purpose.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.1.p.12">3. When switching between channels, peers contact super nodes and the latter help the peers find available peers to fetch the requested media data.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.1.p.13">Peer Protocol: The following investigations are mainly motivated from [Joost- experiment ], in which a data-driven reverse-engineer experiments are performed. We omitted the analysis process and directly show the conclusion. Media data in Joost is split into chunks and then encrypted. Each chunk is packetized with about 5-10 seconds of video data. After receiving peer list from super nodes, a peer negotiates with some or, if necessary, all of the peers in the list to find out what chunks they have. Then the peer makes decision about from which peers to get the chunks. No peer capability information is exchanged in the Peer Protocol.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.3.1.2">3.1.2.</a> Octoshape</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.2.p.1">CNN has been working with a P2P Plug-in, from a Denmark-based company Octoshape, to broadcast its living streaming. Octoshape helps CNN serve a peak of more than a million simultaneous viewers.  It has also provided several innovative delivery technologies such as loss resilient transport, adaptive bit rate, adaptive path optimization and adaptive proximity delivery. Figure 2 depicts the architecture of the Octoshape system.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.2.p.2">Octoshape maintains a mesh overlay topology. Its overlay topology maintenance scheme is similar to that of P2P file-sharing applications, such as BitTorrent. There is no Tracker server in Octoshape, thus no Tracker Protocol is required. Peers obtain live streaming from content servers and peers over Octoshape Protocol.  Several data streams are constructed from live stream. No data streams are identical and any number K of data streams can reconstruct the original live stream. The number K is based on the original media playback rate and the playback rate of each data stream. For example, a 400Kbit/s media is split into four 100Kbit/s data streams, and then k = 4. Data streams are constructed in peers, instead of Broadcast server, which release server from large burden.  The number of data streams constructed in a particular peer equals the number of peers downloading data from the particular peer, which is constrained by the upload capacity of the particular peer. To get the best performance, the upload capacity of a peer should be larger than the playback rate of the live stream. If not, an artificial peer may be added to deliver extra bandwidth.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.2.p.3">Each single peer has an address book of other peers who is watching the same channel. A Standby list is set up based on the address book. The peer periodically probes/asks the peers in the standby list to be sure that they are ready to take over if one of the current senders stops or gets congested. [Octoshape]</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.2.p.4">Peer Protocol: The live stream is firstly sent to a few peers in the network and then be spread to the rest. When a peer joins a channel, it notifies all the other peers about its presence over Peer Protocol, which will drive the others to add it into their address books. Although [Octoshape] declares that each peer records all the peers joining the channel, we suspect that not all the peers are recorded, considering the notification traffic will be large and peers will be busy with recording when a popular program starts in a channel and lots of peers switch to this channel. Maybe some geographic or topological neighbors are notified and the peer gets its address book from these neighbors.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.1.2.p.6">The peer sends requests to some selected peers for the live stream and the receivers answers OK or not according to their upload capacity. The peer continues sending requests to peers until it finds enough peers to provide the needed data streams to redisplay the original live stream. The details of Octoshape are (not?) disclosed yet, we hope someone else can provide much specific information.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.1.3.p.1">PPLive is one of the most popular P2P streaming software in China. It has two major communication protocols. One is Registration and peer discovery protocol, i.e. Tracker Protocol, and the other is P2P chunk distribution protocol, i.e. Peer Protocol. Figure 3 shows the architecture of PPLive.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.3.p.2">Tracker Protocol: First, a peer gets the channel list from the Channel server, in a way similar to that of Joost. Then the peer chooses a channel and asks the Tracker server for the peerlist of this channel.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.3.p.3">Peer Protocol: The peer contacts the peers in its peerlist to get additional peerlists, which are aggregated with its existing list.  Through this list, peers can maintain a mesh for peer management and data delivery.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.3.p.4">For the video-on-demand (VoD) operation, because different peers watch different parts of the channel, a peer buffers up to a few minutes worth of chunks within a sliding window to share with each others. Some of these chunks may be chunks that have been recently played; the remaining chunks are chunks scheduled to be played in the next few minutes. Peers upload chunks to each other. To this end, peers send to each other &#8220;buffer-map&#8221; messages; a buffer-map message indicates which chunks a peer currently has buffered and can share. The buffer-map message includes the offset (the ID of the first chunk), the length of the buffer map, and a string of zeroes and ones indicating which chunks are available (starting with the chunk designated by the offset).

<p id="rfc.section.3.2.2.p.1">Conviva&#8482;[conviva] is a real-time media control platform for Internet multimedia broadcasting. For its early prototype, End System Multicast (ESM) [ESM04] is the underlying networking technology on organizing and maintaining an overlay broadcasting topology. Next we present the overview of ESM. ESM adopts a Tree structure. The architecture of ESM is shown in Figure 7.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.2.p.2">ESM has two versions of protocols: one for smaller scale conferencing apps with multiple sources, and the other for larger scale broadcasting apps with Single source. We focus on the latter version in this survey.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.2.p.3">ESM maintains a single tree for its overlay topology. Its basic functional components include two parts: a bootstrap protocol, a parent selection algorithm, and a light-weight probing protocol for tree topology construction and maintenance; a separate control structure decoupled from tree, where a gossip-like algorithm is used for each member to know a small random subset of group members; members also maintain pathes from source.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.2.p.4">Upon joining, a node gets a subset of group membership from the source (the root node); it then finds parent using a parent selection algorithm. The node uses light-weight probing heuristics to a subset of members it knows, and evaluates remote nodes and chooses a candidate parent. It also uses the parent selection algorithm to deal with performance degradation due to node and network churns.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.2.p.5">ESM Supports for NATs. It allows NATs to be parents of public hosts, and public hosts can be parents of all hosts including NATs as children.</p>

<h1 id="rfc.section.3.3.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.3.1">3.3.1.</a> New Coolstreaming</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.1.p.1">The Coolstreaming, first released in summer 2004 with a mesh-based structure, arguably represented the first successful large-scale P2P live streaming. As the above analysis, it has poor delay performance and high overhead associated each video block transmission. After that, New coolstreaming[New CoolStreaming] adopts a hybrid mesh and tree structure with hybrid pull and push mechanism. All the peers are organized into mesh-based topology in the similar way like pplive to ensure high reliability.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.1.p.2">Besides, content delivery mechanism is the most important part of New Coolstreaming. Fig.8 is the content delivery architecture. The video stream is divided into blocks with equal size, in which each block is assigned a sequence number to represent its playback order in the stream. We divide each video stream into multiple sub-streams without any coding, in which each node can retrieve any sub-stream independently from different parent nodes. This subsequently reduces the impact to content delivery due to a parent departure or failure.  The details of hybrid push and pull content delivery scheme are shown in the following:</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.1.p.3">(1) A node first subscribes to a sub-stream by connecting to one of its partners via a single request (pull) in BM, the requested partner, i.e., the parent node.( The node can subscribe more sub-streams to its partners in this way to obtain higher play quality.)</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.1.p.4">(2) The selected parent node will continue pushing all blocks in need of the sub-stream to the requested node.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.1.p.5">This not only reduces the overhead associated with each video block transfer, but more importantly, significantly reduces the timing involved in retrieving video content.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.p.3">The functionality of Tracker and data transfer in Mesh-based application and Tree-based is a little different. In the Mesh-based applications, such as Joost and PPLive, Tracker maintains the lists of peers storing chunks for a specific channel or streaming file. It provides peer list for peers to download from, as well as upload to, each other. In the Tree-based applications, such as PeerCast and Canviva, Tracker directs new peers to find parent nodes and the data flows from parent to child only.</p>
