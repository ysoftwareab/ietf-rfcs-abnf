Internet-Draft           BFD Down Cease Subcode            November 2006


1  BFD session down subcode

   A new subcode with value 9 and symbolic name "BFD Session Down" is
   defined for the Cease NOTIFICATION message in addition to the
   existing subcodes defined in RFC4486 [2].

   If a BGP speaker decides to terminate its peering with a neighbor
   because its BFD [3] session to that neighbor went down then the
   speaker SHOULD send a NOTIFICATION message to the neighbor with the
   error code cease and the error subcode "BFD session down".  The
   NOTIFICATION message SHOULD have no data.

2  IANA considerations

   As specified in RFC4486 [2] the "BFD Session Down" subcode is
   assigned using the Early IANA Allocation process defined in RFC4020
   [1] which requires an Internet Draft that is proposed as Standards
   Track.

3  Security consideration

   This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues
   inherent in the existing BGP.
