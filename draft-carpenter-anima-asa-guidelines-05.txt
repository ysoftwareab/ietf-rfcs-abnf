1.  Introduction

   This document proposes guidelines for the design of Autonomic Service
   Agents (ASAs) in the context of an Autonomic Network (AN) based on
   the Autonomic Network Infrastructure (ANI) outlined in the ANIMA
   reference model [I-D.ietf-anima-reference-model].  This
   infrastructure makes use of the Autonomic Control Plane (ACP)

   [I-D.ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane] and the Generic Autonomic
   Signaling Protocol (GRASP) [I-D.ietf-anima-grasp].

   There is a considerable literature about autonomic agents with a
   variety of proposals about how they should be characterized.  Some
   examples are [DeMola06], [Huebscher08], [Movahedi12] and [GANA13].
   However, for the present document, the basic definitions and goals
   for autonomic networking given in [RFC7575] apply . According to RFC
   7575, an Autonomic Service Agent is "An agent implemented on an
   autonomic node that implements an autonomic function, either in part
   (in the case of a distributed function) or whole."

   ASAs must be distinguished from other forms of software component.
   They are components of network or service management; they do not in
   themselves provide services.  For example, the services envisaged for
   network function virtualisation
   [I-D.irtf-nfvrg-gaps-network-virtualization] or for service function
   chaining [RFC7665] might be managed by an ASA rather than by
   traditional configuration tools.

   The reference model [I-D.ietf-anima-reference-model] expands this by
   adding that an ASA is "a process that makes use of the features
   provided by the ANI to achieve its own goals, usually including
   interaction with other ASAs via the GRASP protocol
   [I-D.ietf-anima-grasp] or otherwise.  Of course it also interacts
   with the specific targets of its function, using any suitable
   mechanism.  Unless its function is very simple, the ASA will need to
   handle overlapping asynchronous operations.  It may therefore be a
   quite complex piece of software in its own right, forming part of the
   application layer above the ANI."

   There will certainly be very simple ASAs that manage a single
   objective in a straightforward way and do not asynchronous
   operations.  In such a case, many aspects of the current document do
   not apply.  However, in general a basic property of an ASA is that it
   is a relatively complex software component that will in many cases
   control and monitor simpler entities in the same host or elsewhere.
   For example, a device controller that manages tens or hundreds of
   simple devices might contain a single ASA.

   The remainder of this document offers guidance on the design of such
   ASAs.

2.  Logical Structure of an Autonomic Service Agent

   As mentioned above, all but the simplest ASAs will be multi-threaded
   programs.

Internet-Draft               ASA Guidelines                    June 2018


   A typical ASA will have a main thread that performs various initial
   housekeeping actions such as:

   o  Obtain authorization credentials.

   o  Register the ASA with GRASP.

   o  Acquire relevant policy Intent.

   o  Define data structures for relevant GRASP objectives.

   o  Register with GRASP those objectives that it will actively manage.

   o  Launch a self-monitoring thread.

   o  Enter its main loop.

   The logic of the main loop will depend on the details of the
   autonomic function concerned.  Whenever asynchronous operations are
   required, extra threads will be launched.  Examples of such threads
   include:

   o  A background thread to repeatedly flood an objective to the AN, so
      that any ASA can receive the objective's latest value.

   o  A thread to accept incoming synchronization requests for an
      objective managed by this ASA.

   o  A thread to accept incoming negotiation requests for an objective
      managed by this ASA, and then to conduct the resulting negotiation
      with the counterpart ASA.

   o  A thread to manage subsidiary non-autonomic devices directly.

   These threads should all either exit after their job is done, or
   enter a wait state for new work, to avoid blocking other threads
   unnecessarily.

   Not all programming environments explicitly support multi-threading.
   In such cases, an 'event loop' style of implementation could be
   adopted, in which case each of the above threads would be implemented
   as an event handler called in turn by the main loop.  In this case,
   the GRASP API (Section 3.3) must provide non-blocking calls.  If
   necessary, the GRASP session identifier will be used to distinguish
   simultaneous operations.

   According to the degree of parallelism needed by the application,
   some of these threads might be launched in multiple instances.  In



Carpenter, et al.        Expires January 1, 2019                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               ASA Guidelines                    June 2018


   particular, if negotiation sessions with other ASAs are expected to
   be long or to involve wait states, the ASA designer might allow for
   multiple simultaneous negotiating threads, with appropriate use of
   queues and locks to maintain consistency.

   The main loop itself could act as the initiator of synchronization
   requests or negotiation requests, when the ASA needs data or
   resources from other ASAs.  In particular, the main loop should watch
   for changes in policy Intent that affect its operation.  It should
   also do whatever is required to avoid unnecessary resource
   consumption, such as including an arbitrary wait time in each cycle
   of the main loop.

   The self-monitoring thread is of considerable importance.  Autonomic
   service agents must never fail.  To a large extent this depends on
   careful coding and testing, with no unhandled error returns or
   exceptions, but if there is nevertheless some sort of failure, the
   self-monitoring thread should detect it, fix it if possible, and in
   the worst case restart the entire ASA.

   Appendix B presents some example logic flows in informal pseudocode.

3.  Interaction with the Autonomic Networking Infrastructure

3.1.  Interaction with the security mechanisms

   An ASA by definition runs in an autonomic node.  Before any normal
   ASAs are started, such nodes must be bootstrapped into the autonomic
   network's secure key infrastructure in accordance with
   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra].  This key infrastructure
   will be used to secure the ACP (next section) and may be used by ASAs
   to set up additional secure interactions with their peers, if needed.

   Note that the secure bootstrap process itself may include special-
   purpose ASAs that run in a constrained insecure mode.

3.2.  Interaction with the Autonomic Control Plane

   In a normal autonomic network, ASAs will run as clients of the ACP.
   It will provide a fully secured network environment for all
   communication with other ASAs, in most cases mediated by GRASP (next
   section).

   Note that the ACP formation process itself may include special-
   purpose ASAs that run in a constrained insecure mode.

Internet-Draft               ASA Guidelines                    June 2018


3.3.  Interaction with GRASP and its API

   GRASP [I-D.ietf-anima-grasp] is expected to run as a separate process
   with its API [I-D.ietf-anima-grasp-api] available in user space.
   Thus ASAs may operate without special privilege, unless they need it
   for other reasons.  The ASA's view of GRASP is built around GRASP
   objectives (Section 5), defined as data structures containing
   administrative information such as the objective's unique name, and
   its current value.  The format and size of the value is not
   restricted by the protocol, except that it must be possible to
   serialise it for transmission in CBOR [RFC7049], which is no
   restriction at all in practice.

   The GRASP API should offer the following features:

   o  Registration functions, so that an ASA can register itself and the
      objectives that it manages.

   o  A discovery function, by which an ASA can discover other ASAs
      supporting a given objective.

   o  A negotiation request function, by which an ASA can start
      negotiation of an objective with a counterpart ASA.  With this,
      there is a corresponding listening function for an ASA that wishes
      to respond to negotiation requests, and a set of functions to
      support negotiating steps.

   o  A synchronization function, by which an ASA can request the
      current value of an objective from a counterpart ASA.  With this,
      there is a corresponding listening function for an ASA that wishes
      to respond to synchronization requests.

   o  A flood function, by which an ASA can cause the current value of
      an objective to be flooded throughout the AN so that any ASA can
      receive it.

   For further details and some additional housekeeping functions, see
   [I-D.ietf-anima-grasp-api].

   This API is intended to support the various interactions expected
   between most ASAs, such as the interactions outlined in Section 2.
   However, if ASAs require additional communication between themselves,
   they can do so using any desired protocol.  One option is to use
   GRASP discovery and synchronization as a rendez-vous mechanism
   between two ASAs, passing communication parameters such as a TCP port
   number via GRASP.  As noted above, either the ACP or in special cases
   the autonomic key infrastructure will be used to secure such
   communications.

Internet-Draft               ASA Guidelines                    June 2018


3.4.  Interaction with Intent mechanism

   At the time of writing, the Intent mechanism for the ANI is
   undefined.  It is expected to operate by an information distribution
   mechanism that can reach all autonomic nodes, and therefore every
   ASA.  However, each ASA must be capable of operating "out of the box"
   in the absence of locally defined Intent, so every ASA implementation
   must include carefully chosen default values and settings for all
   parameters and choices that might depend on Intent.

4.  Interaction with Non-Autonomic Components

   An ASA, to have any external effects, must also interact with non-
   autonomic components of the node where it is installed.  For example,
   an ASA whose purpose is to manage a resource must interact with that
   resource.  An ASA whose purpose is to manage an entity that is
   already managed by local software must interact with that software.
   This is stating the obvious, and the details are specific to each
   case, but it has an important security implication.  The ASA might
   act as a loophole by which the managed entity could penetrate the
   security boundary of the ANI.  The ASA must be designed to avoid such
   loopholes, and should if possible operate in an unprivileged mode.

   In an environment where systems are virtualized and specialized using
   techniques such as network function virtualization or network
   slicing, there will be a design choice whether ASAs are deployed once
   per physical node or once per virtual context.  A related issue is
   whether the ANI as a whole is deployed once on a physical network, or
   whether several virtual ANIs are deployed.  This aspect needs to be
   considered by the ASA designer.

5.  Design of GRASP Objectives

   The general rules for the format of GRASP Objective options, their
   names, and IANA registration are given in [I-D.ietf-anima-grasp].
   Additionally that document discusses various general considerations
   for the design of objectives, which are not repeated here.  However,
   we emphasize that the GRASP protocol does not provide transactional
   integrity.  In other words, if an ASA is capable of overlapping
   several negotiations for a given objective, then the ASA itself must
   use suitable locking techniques to avoid interference between these
   negotiations.  For example, if an ASA is allocating part of a shared
   resource to other ASAs, it needs to ensure that the same part of the
   resource is not allocated twice.  This might impact the design of the
   objective as well as the logic flow of the ASA.

   In particular, if 'dry run' mode is defined for the objective, its
   specification, and every implementation, must consider what state



Carpenter, et al.        Expires January 1, 2019                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft               ASA Guidelines                    June 2018


   needs to be saved following a dry run negotiation, such that a
   subsequent live negotiation can be expected to succeed.  It must be
   clear how long this state is kept, and what happens if the live
   negotiation occurs after this state is deleted.  An ASA that requests
   a dry run negotiation must take account of the possibility that a
   successful dry run is followed by a failed live negotiation.  Because
   of these complexities, the dry run mechanism should only be supported
   by objectives and ASAs where there is a significant benefit from it.

   The actual value field of an objective is limited by the GRASP
   protocol definition to any data structure that can be expressed in
   Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) [RFC7049].  For some
   objectives, a single data item will suffice; for example an integer,
   a floating point number or a UTF-8 string.  For more complex cases, a
   simple tuple structure such as [item1, item2, item3] could be used.
   Nothing prevents using other formats such as JSON, but this requires
   the ASA to be capable of parsing and generating JSON.  The formats
   acceptable by the GRASP API will limit the options in practice.  A
   fallback solution is for the API to accept and deliver the value
   field in raw CBOR, with the ASA itself encoding and decoding it via a
   CBOR library.

   Note that a mapping from YANG to CBOR is defined by
   [I-D.ietf-core-yang-cbor].  Subject to the size limit defined for
   GRASP messages, nothing prevents objectives using YANG in this way.

6.  Life Cycle

   Autonomic functions could be permanent, in the sense that ASAs are
   shipped as part of a product and persist throughout the product's
   life.  However, a more likely situation is that ASAs need to be
   installed or updated dynamically, because of new requirements or
   bugs.  Because continuity of service is fundamental to autonomic
   networking, the process of seamlessly replacing a running instance of
   an ASA with a new version needs to be part of the ASA's design.

   The implication of service continuity on the design of ASAs can be
   illustrated along the three main phases of the ASA life-cycle, namely
   Installation, Instantiation and Operation.

6.1.  Installation phase

   Before being able to instantiate and run ASAs, the operator must
   first provision the infrastructure with the sets of ASA software
   corresponding to its needs and objectives.  The provisioning of the
   infrastructure is realized in the installation phase and consists in
   installing (or checking the availability of) the pieces of software
   of the different ASA classes in a set of Installation Hosts.

   There are 3 properties applicable to the installation of ASAs:

   The dynamic installation property  allows installing an ASA on
      demand, on any hosts compatible with the ASA.

   The decoupling property  allows controlling resources of a NE from a
      remote ASA, i.e. an ASA installed on a host machine different from
      the resources' NE.

   The multiplicity property  allows controlling multiple sets of
      resources from a single ASA.

   These three properties are very important in the context of the
   installation phase as their variations condition how the ASA class
   could be installed on the infrastructure.

Internet-Draft               ASA Guidelines                    June 2018


6.1.1.  Installation phase inputs and outputs

   Inputs are:

   [ASA class of type_x]  that specifies which classes ASAs to install,

   [Installation_target_Infrastructure]  that specifies the candidate
      Installation Hosts,

   [ASA class placement function, e.g. under which criteria/constraints
   as defined by the operator]
      that specifies how the installation phase shall meet the
      operator's needs and objectives for the provision of the
      infrastructure.  In the coupled mode, the placement function is
      not necessary, whereas in the decoupled mode, the placement
      function is mandatory, even though it can be as simple as an
      explicit list of Installation hosts.

   The main output of the installation phase is an up-to-date directory
   of installed ASAs which corresponds to [list of ASA classes]
   installed on [list of installation Hosts].  This output is also
   useful for the coordination function and corresponds to the static
   interaction map (see next section).

   The condition to validate in order to pass to next phase is to ensure
   that [list of ASA classes] are well installed on [list of
   installation Hosts].  The state of the ASA at the end of the
   installation phase is: installed. (not instantiated).  The following
   commands or messages are foreseen: install(list of ASA classes,
   Installation_target_Infrastructure, ASA class placement function),
   and un-install (list of ASA classes).

6.2.  Instantiation phase

   Once the ASAs are installed on the appropriate hosts in the network,
   these ASA may start to operate.  From the operator viewpoint, an
   operating ASA means the ASA manages the network resources as per the
   objectives given.  At the ASA local level, operating means executing
   their control loop/algorithm.

   But right before that, there are two things to take into
   consideration.  First, there is a difference between 1. having a
   piece of code available to run on a host and 2. having an agent based
   on this piece of code running inside the host.  Second, in a coupled
   case, determining which resources are controlled by an ASA is
   straightforward (the determination is embedded), in a decoupled mode
   determining this is a bit more complex (hence a starting agent will
   have to either discover or be taught it).

Internet-Draft               ASA Guidelines                    June 2018


   The instantiation phase of an ASA covers both these aspects: starting
   the agent piece of code (when this does not start automatically) and
   determining which resources have to be controlled (when this is not
   obvious).

6.2.1.  Operator's goal

   Through this phase, the operator wants to control its autonomic
   network in two things:

   1  determine the scope of autonomic functions by instructing which of
      the network resources have to be managed by which autonomic
      function (and more precisely which class e.g. 1. version X or
      version Y or 2. provider A or provider B),

   2  determine how the autonomic functions are organized by instructing
      which ASAs have to interact with which other ASAs (or more
      precisely which set of network resources have to be handled as an
      autonomous group by their managing ASAs).

   Additionally in this phase, the operator may want to set objectives
   to autonomic functions, by configuring the ASAs technical objectives.

   The operator's goal can be summarized in an instruction to the ANIMA
   ecosystem matching the following pattern:

      [ASA of type_x instances] ready to control
      [Instantiation_target_Infrastructure] with
      [Instantiation_target_parameters]

6.2.2.  Instantiation phase inputs and outputs

   Inputs are:

   [ASA of type_x instances]  that specifies which are the ASAs to be
      targeted (and more precisely which class e.g. 1. version X or
      version Y or 2. provider A or provider B),

   [Instantiation_target_Infrastructure]  that specifies which are the
      resources to be managed by the autonomic function, this can be the
      whole network or a subset of it like a domain a technology segment
      or even a specific list of resources,

   [Instantiation_target_parameters]  that specifies which are the
      technical objectives to be set to ASAs (e.g. an optimization
      target)

   Outputs are:

Internet-Draft               ASA Guidelines                    June 2018


   [Set of ASAs - Resources relations]  describing which resources are
      managed by which ASA instances, this is not a formal message, but
      a resulting configuration of a set of ASAs,

6.2.3.  Instantiation phase requirements

   The instructions described in section 4.2 could be either:

   sent to a targeted ASA  In which case, the receiving Agent will have
      to manage the specified list of
      [Instantiation_target_Infrastructure], with the
      [Instantiation_target_parameters].

   broadcast to all ASAs  In which case, the ASAs would collectively
      determine from the list which Agent(s) would handle which
      [Instantiation_target_Infrastructure], with the
      [Instantiation_target_parameters].

   This set of instructions can be materialized through a message that
   is named an Instance Mandate (description TBD).

   The conclusion of this instantiation phase is a ready to operate ASA
   (or interacting set of ASAs), then this (or those) ASA(s) can
   describe themselves by depicting which are the resources they manage
   and what this means in terms of metrics being monitored and in terms
   of actions that can be executed (like modifying the parameters
   values).  A message conveying such a self description is named an
   Instance Manifest (description TBD).

   Though the operator may well use such a self-description "per se",
   the final goal of such a description is to be shared with other ANIMA
   entities like:

   o  the coordination entities (see [I-D.ciavaglia-anima-coordination]
      - Autonomic Functions Coordination)

   o  collaborative entities in the purpose of establishing knowledge
      exchanges (some ASAs may produce knowledge or even monitor metrics
      that other ASAs cannot make by themselves why those would be
      useful for their execution)

6.3.  Operation phase

   Note: This section is to be further developed in future revisions of
   the document, especially the implications on the design of ASAs.

   During the Operation phase, the operator can:




Carpenter, et al.        Expires January 1, 2019               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft               ASA Guidelines                    June 2018


      Activate/Deactivate ASA: meaning enabling those to execute their
      autonomic loop or not.

      Modify ASAs targets: meaning setting them different objectives.

      Modify ASAs managed resources: by updating the instance mandate
      which would specify different set of resources to manage (only
      applicable to decouples ASAs).

   During the Operation phase, running ASAs can interact the one with
   the other:

      in order to exchange knowledge (e.g. an ASA providing traffic
      predictions to load balancing ASA)

      in order to collaboratively reach an objective (e.g.  ASAs
      pertaining to the same autonomic function targeted to manage a
      network domain, these ASA will collaborate - in the case of a load
      balancing one, by modifying the links metrics according to the
      neighboring resources loads)

   During the Operation phase, running ASAs are expected to apply
   coordination schemes

      then execute their control loop under coordination supervision/
      instructions

   The ASA life-cycle is discussed in more detail in "A Day in the Life
   of an Autonomic Function" [I-D.peloso-anima-autonomic-function].

7.  Coordination between Autonomic Functions

   Some autonomic functions will be completely independent of each
   other.  However, others are at risk of interfering with each other -
   for example, two different optimization functions might both attempt
   to modify the same underlying parameter in different ways.  In a
   complete system, a method is needed of identifying ASAs that might
   interfere with each other and coordinating their actions when
   necessary.  This issue is considered in "Autonomic Functions
   Coordination" [I-D.ciavaglia-anima-coordination].

8.  Coordination with Traditional Management Functions

   Some ASAs will have functions that overlap with existing
   configuration tools and network management mechanisms such as command
   line interfaces, DHCP, DHCPv6, SNMP, NETCONF, RESTCONF and YANG-based
   solutions.  Each ASA designer will need to consider this issue and
   how to avoid clashes and inconsistencies.  Some specific



Carpenter, et al.        Expires January 1, 2019               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft               ASA Guidelines                    June 2018


   considerations for interaction with OAM tools are given in
   [I-D.ietf-anima-stable-connectivity].  As another example,
   [I-D.ietf-anima-prefix-management] describes how autonomic management
   of IPv6 prefixes can interact with prefix delegation via DHCPv6.  The
   description of a GRASP objective and of an ASA using it should
   include a discussion of any such interactions.

   A related aspect is that management functions often include a data
   model, quite likely to be expressed in a formal notation such as
   YANG.  This aspect should not be an afterthought in the design of an
   ASA.  To the contrary, the design of the ASA and of its GRASP
   objectives should match the data model; as noted above, YANG
   serialized as CBOR may be used directly as the value of a GRASP
   objective.

9.  Robustness

   It is of great importance that all components of an autonomic system
   are highly robust.  In principle they must never fail.  This section
   lists various aspects of robustness that ASA designers should
   consider.

   1.  If despite all precautions, an ASA does encounter a fatal error,
       it should in any case restart automatically and try again.  To
       mitigate a hard loop in case of persistent failure, a suitable
       pause should be inserted before such a restart.  The length of
       the pause depends on the use case.

   2.  If a newly received or calculated value for a parameter falls out
       of bounds, the corresponding parameter should be either left
       unchanged or restored to a safe value.

   3.  If a GRASP synchronization or negotiation session fails for any
       reason, it may be repeated after a suitable pause.  The length of
       the pause depends on the use case.

   4.  If a session fails repeatedly, the ASA should consider that its
       peer has failed, and cause GRASP to flush its discovery cache and
       repeat peer discovery.

   5.  Any received GRASP message should be checked.  If it is wrongly
       formatted, it should be ignored.  Within a unicast session, an
       Invalid message (M_INVALID) may be sent.  This function may be
       provided by the GRASP implementation itself.

   6.  Any received GRASP objective should be checked.  If it is wrongly
       formatted, it should be ignored.  Within a negotiation session, a
       Negotiation End message (M_END) with a Decline option (O_DECLINE)



Carpenter, et al.        Expires January 1, 2019               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft               ASA Guidelines                    June 2018


       should be sent.  An ASA may log such events for diagnostic
       purposes.

   7.  If an ASA receives either an Invalid message (M_INVALID) or a
       Negotiation End message (M_END) with a Decline option
       (O_DECLINE), one possible reason is that the peer ASA does not
       support a new feature of either GRASP or of the objective in
       question.  In such a case the ASA may choose to repeat the
       operation concerned without using that new feature.

   8.  All other possible exceptions should be handled in an orderly
       way.  There should be no such thing as an unhandled exception
       (but see point 1 above).

10.  Security Considerations

   ASAs are intended to run in an environment that is protected by the
   Autonomic Control Plane [I-D.ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane],
   admission to which depends on an initial secure bootstrap process
   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra].  However, this does not
   relieve ASAs of responsibility for security.  In particular, when
   ASAs configure or manage network elements outside the ACP, they must
   use secure techniques and carefully validate any incoming
   information.  As appropriate to their specific functions, ASAs should
   take account of relevant privacy considerations [RFC6973].

   Authorization of ASAs is a subject for future study.  At present,
   ASAs are trusted by virtue of being installed on a node that has
   successfully joined the ACP.

11.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of the IANA.

   Initial version

Appendix B.  Example Logic Flows

   This appendix outlines logic flows for a general purpose resource
   management ASA.  It is assumed that all ASA instances managing this
   resource use the same logic.  However, one instance acts as a master,
   initialised with a resource pool and a set of policy parameters.  The
   ASA uses a notional objective EX1 and an associated policy parameters
   objective EX1.Params.

B.1.  Threaded Example

   MAIN Thread:

   Create empty resource pool
   Decide whether to act as master
   if master:
     Obtain initial resources from NOC and add to pool
     Obtain EX1.Params values from NOC, or use default values
   Register ASA with GRASP
   Register objectives EX1 and EX1.Params
   if master:
     Start FLOODER thread to flood EX1.Params
     Start SYNCHRONIZER listener thread for EX1.Params
   Start MAIN_NEGOTIATOR and GARBAGE_COLLECTOR threads
   if not master:
     Obtain value of EX1.Params (from flood cache or via M_SYN message)
   Start ASSIGN thread
   while True:
     if resource pool is low:
       Calculate needed amount of resource
       Discover peers (M_DISCOVER / M_RESPONSE)
       Choose a peer (prefer good_peer if available)
       Send M_REQ_NEG("EX1", peer)
       Wait for response (M_NEGOTIATE, M_END or M_WAIT)
       if OK:
         if offered resource is sufficient:
           Negotiation succeeded: Send M_END + O_ACCEPT
           Add resource to pool
           good_peer = peer
         else:
           Fail negotiation: Send M_END + O_DECLINE
     sleep(10s)

   MAIN_NEGOTIATOR Thread :

Internet-Draft               ASA Guidelines                    June 2018


   while True:
     Wait for M_REQ_NEG for EX1
     start a separate new NEGOTIATOR thread
      (allows simultaneous negotiations)

   NEGOTIATOR Thread:

   Fetch available resource from pool
   if OK:
     Offer resource to peer: Send M_NEGOTIATE for EX1 objective
     if OK:
       Received M_END + O_ACCEPT
       Negotiation succeeded
     else:
       Received M_END + O_DECLINE or other error
       Return resource to pool
   else:
     Fail negotiation: Send  M_END + O_DECLINE

   ASSIGN Thread:

   while True:
     wait for resource request from managed entity
     get resource from pool
     if OK:
       assign resource to managed entity
     else:
       signal main thread that pool is low

   GARBAGE_COLLECTOR Thread:

   while True:
     return unused resources to pool
     sleep(5s)

   SYNCHRONIZER Thread:

   while True:
     wait for  M_REQ_SYN message for EX1.Params
     reply with M_SYNCH message for EX1.Params

   FLOODER Thread:

   while True:
     send M_FLOOD message for EX1.Params
     sleep(60s)
