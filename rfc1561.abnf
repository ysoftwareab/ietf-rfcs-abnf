A=1  choose path that maintains sequence over
              one that minimizes transit delay
A=0  choose path that minimizes transit delay over
              one that maintains sequence
B=1  congestion experienced
B=0  no congestion to report
C=1  choose path that minimizes transit delay over
              over low cost
C=0  choose low cost over path that
              minimizes transit delay
D=1  choose pathe with low residual error probability over
              one that minimizes transit delay
D=0  choose path that minimizes transit delay over
              one with low residual error probability
E=1  choose path with low residual error probability over
              low cost
E=0  choose path with low cost over one with low
              residual error probability
