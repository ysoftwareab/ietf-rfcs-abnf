1.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

   o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
       purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
       Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
       STD 16 [RFC1155, RFC1212] and RFC 1215 [RFC1215].  The second 
       version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58 [RFC2578, RFC2579,
       RFC2580].

   o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
       first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
       described in STD 15 [RFC1157].  A second version of the SNMP
       message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
       protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901]
       and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the message
       protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906],
       RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

   o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
       first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
       described in STD 15 [RFC1157].  A second set of protocol
       operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
       [RFC1905].

   o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [RFC2573]
       and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC

       2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. The
   textual conventions used in this MIB module cannot be translated
   to SMIv1 since the Counter64 type does not exist in SMIv1.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 
   [RFC2119].

2.  Overview

   This document describes an SNMP MIB for managing VDSL Lines.  These
   definitions are based upon the specifications for VDSL as defined 
   in T1E1, ETSI, and ITU documentation [T1E1311, T1E1011, T1E1013, 
   ETSI2701, ETSI2702, ITU9931, ITU9971].

   The MIB is located in the MIB tree under MIB 2 transmission, as 
   discussed in the MIB-2 Integration (RFC 2863 [RFC2863]) section of 
   this document.  

2.1  Relationship of the VDSL Line MIB to other MIBs

   This section outlines the relationship of this MIB with other MIBs 
   described in RFCs.  Specifically, IF-MIB as presented RFC 2863
   [RFC2863] is discussed.

2.1.1  General IF-MIB Integration (RFC 2863)

   The VDSL Line MIB specifies the detailed attributes of a data
   interface.  As such, it needs to integrate with RFC 2863 [RFC2863].
   The IANA has assigned the following ifType to VDSL:

   IANAifType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
       ...

   SYNTAX INTEGER {
       ...
       vdsl(97), -- Very H-speed Digital Subscrib. Loop
       ...
       }

   Additionally, a VDSL line may contain an optional fast channel
   and an optional interleaved channel which also integrate into RFC 
   2863 [RFC2863].  The IANA has assigned the following ifTypes to these
   channels:

INTERNET-DRAFT                 VDSL-LINE MIB                    May 2003


   IANAifType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
       ...
   SYNTAX INTEGER {
       ...
       interleave (124), -- Interleave channel
       fast (125),       -- Fast channel
       ...
       }

2.1.2  Usage of ifTable

   The MIB branch identified by this ifType contains tables appropriate
   for this interface type.  Most such tables extend the ifEntry table,
   and are indexed by ifIndex.  For interfaces in systems implementing
   this MIB, those table entries indexed by ifIndex MUST be persistent.

   The following attributes are part of the mandatory ifGeneral group in
   RFC 2863 [RFC2863], and are not duplicated in the VDSL Line MIB.

   ===================================================================
       ifIndex                  Interface index.

       ifDescr                  See interfaces MIB [RFC2863].

       ifType                   vdsl(97),
                                interleaved(124), or
                                fast(125)

       ifSpeed                  Set as appropriate.
    
       ifPhysAddress            This object MUST have an octet string
                                with zero length.

       ifAdminStatus            See interfaces MIB [RFC2863].

       ifOperStatus             See interfaces MIB [RFC2863].

       ifLastChange             See interfaces MIB [RFC2863].

       ifName                   See interfaces MIB [RFC2863].

       ifHighSpeed              Set as appropriate.

       ifConnectorPresent       Set as appropriate.

       ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable   Default to enabled(1).

   to ifEntry in greater detail.

   and to define the behavior of the statistics to be maintained
   by an agent.

   o    VdslLineCodingType :

   Attributes with this syntax identify the line coding used.
   Specified as an INTEGER, the three values are:

   other(1)  -- none of the following
   mcm(2)    -- Multiple Carrier Modulation 
   scm(3)    -- Single Carrier Modulation

   o    VdslLineEntity :

   Attributes with this syntax reference the two sides of a line.

INTERNET-DRAFT                 VDSL-LINE MIB                    May 2003

   The MIB is structured into following MIB groups:

   o   vdslGroup :

   This group supports all line code independent MIB objects found
   in this MIB.  The following tables contain objects permitted for
   ifType vdsl(97):

       - vdslLineTable 
       - vdslPhysTable 
       - vdslPerfDataTable
       - vdslPerfIntervalTable
       - vdslPerf1DayIntervalTable
       - vdslLineConfProfileTable
       - vdslLineAlarmConfProfileTable 

   The following tables contain objects permitted for ifTypes 
   interleaved(124) and (fast):

       - vdslChanTable 
       - vdslChanPerfDataTable
       - vdslChanPerfIntervalTable
       - vdslChanPerf1DayIntervalTable


   Figure 2, below, displays the relationship of the tables in the
   vdslGroup to ifEntry (and each other):


      ifEntry(ifType=97)  ----> vdslLineTableEntry 1:(0..1)

2.4  Counters, Interval Buckets and Thresholds

   For Loss of Frame (lof), Loss of Link (lol), Loss of Signal (los),
   and Loss of Power (lpr), Errored Seconds (ES), Severely Errored
   Seconds (SES), and Unavailable Seconds (UAS) there are event 
   counters, current 15-minute, 0 to 96 15-minute history bucket(s),
   and 0 to 30 1-day history bucket(s) of "interval-counters".  Each
   current 15-minute event bucket has an associated threshold 
   notification.

   Each of these counters uses the textual conventions defined in the
   HC-PerfHist-TC-MIB.  The HC-PerfHist-TC-MIB is a work-in-progress,
   but simply defines 64-bit versions of the textual conventions
   found in RFC 2493 [RFC2493].

   There is no requirement for an agent to ensure a fixed relationship
   between the start of a fifteen minute and any wall clock; however
   some implementations may align the fifteen minute intervals with
   quarter hours. Likewise, an implementation may choose to align one
   day intervals with the start of a day.

   Counters are not reset when an Vtu is reinitialized, only when the
   agent is reset or reinitialized (or under specific request outside
   the scope of this MIB).

2.5  Profiles

   As a managed node can handle a large number of Vtus, (e.g., hundreds
   or perhaps thousands of lines), provisioning every parameter on every 
   Vtu may become burdensome.  Moreover, most lines are provisioned 
   identically with the same set of parameters.  To simplify the 
   provisioning process, this MIB makes use of profiles.  A profile is a
   set of parameters that can be shared by multiple lines using the same 
   configuration.

   The following profiles are used in this MIB:

   o   Line Configuration Profiles - Line configuration profiles contain
       parameters for configuring VDSL lines.  They are defined in the
       vdslLineConfProfileTable.


Expires November 1, 2003                                        [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT                 VDSL-LINE MIB                    May 2003

   o   Alarm Configuration Profiles - These profiles contain parameters 
       for configuring alarm thresholds for VDSL modems.  These profiles
       are defined in the vdslLineAlarmConfProfileTable.

   One or more lines may be configured to share parameters of a single
   profile by setting its vdslLineConfProfile objects to the value of 
   this profile. If a change is made to the profile, all lines that 
   refer to it will be reconfigured to the changed parameters.  Before
   a profile can be deleted or taken out of service it must be first 
   unreferenced from all associated lines.

   Implementations MUST provide a default profile with an index value of
   `DEFVAL' for each profile type.  The values of the associated 
   parameters will be vendor specific unless otherwise indicated in this 
   document.  Before a line's profiles have been set, these profiles 
   will be automatically used by setting vdslLineConfProfile and
   vdslLineAlarmConfProfile to `DEFVAL' where appropriate.  This
   default profile name, 'DEFVAL', is considered reserved in the context
   of profiles defined in this MIB.

   Profiles are created, assigned, and deleted dynamically using the
   profile name and profile row status in each of the ten profile
   tables (nine line configuration tables and one alarm configuration
   table).

   Profile changes MUST take effect immediately.  These changes MAY
   result in a restart (hard reset or soft restart) of the units on the
   line.

2.6  Notifications

   The ability to generate the SNMP notifications coldStart/WarmStart
   (per [RFC2863]) which are per agent (e.g., per Digital Subscriber 
   Line Access Multiplexer, or DSLAM, in such a device), and 
   linkUp/linkDown (per [RFC2863]) which are per interface (i.e., VDSL 
   line) is required.

   The notifications defined in this MIB are for initialization failure
   and for the threshold crossings associated with the following events:
   lof, lol, los, lpr, ES, SES, and UAS.  Each threshold has its own 
   enable/threshold value. When that value is 0, the notification is 
   disabled.

   A linkDown notification MAY be generated whenever any of lof, lol,
   los, lpr, ES, SES, or UAS threshold crossing event (as defined
   in this MIB) occurs.  The corresponding linkUp notification MAY be 
   sent when all link failure conditions are cleared.

   The vdslCurrStatus is a bitmask representing all outstanding error 
   conditions associated with a particular VDSL modem.  Note that since 
   status of remote modems is obtained via the EOC, this information 
   may be unavailable for units that are unreachable via EOC during a 
   line error condition.  Therefore, not all conditions may always be 
   included in its current status.  Notifications corresponding to the

INTERNET-DRAFT                 VDSL-LINE MIB                    May 2003

   bit fields in this object are defined.

   A threshold notification occurs whenever the corresponding current 
   15-minute interval error counter becomes equal to, or exceeds the 
   threshold value. One notification may be sent per interval per 
   interface. Since the current 15-minute counter are reset to 0 every 
   15 minutes, if the condition persists, the notification may recur as 
   often as every 15 minutes.  For example, to get a notification 
   whenever a "loss of" event occurs (but at most once every 15 
   minutes), set the corresponding threshold to 1. The agent will 
   generate a notification when the event originally occurs.

   Note that the Network Management System, or NMS, may receive a 
   linkDown notification, as well, if enabled (via 
   ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable [RFC2863]). At the beginning of the next 15
   minute interval, the counter is reset.  When the first second goes 
   by and the event occurs, the current interval bucket will be 1, 
   which equals the threshold and the notification will be sent again.

2.7  Persistence

   All objects defined in this MIB which may be set (read-write or
   read-create), should be stored persistently.  Following is an
   exhaustive list of these persistent objects:

    DESCRIPTION
        "The MIB module defining objects for the management of a pair of
        VDSL modems at each end of the VDSL line.  Each such line has
        an entry in an ifTable which may include multiple modem lines.
        An agent may reside at either end of the VDSL line however the
        MIB is designed to require no management communication between
        them beyond that inherent in the low-level VDSL line protocol.
        The agent may monitor and control this protocol for its needs.

        VDSL lines may support optional Fast or Interleaved channels.
        If these are supported, additional entries corresponding to the
        supported channels must be created in the ifTable. Thus a VDSL

Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   VDSL layer connectivity from the Vtur will permit the subscriber 
   to manipulate both the VDSL link directly and the VDSL embedded  
   operations channel (EOC) for their own loop. For example, unchecked

   or unfiltered fluctuations initiated by the subscriber could generate 
   sufficient notifications to potentially overwhelm either the 
   management interface to the network or the element manager. 

   For this reason, there are a number of managed objects in this MIB 
   that may contain sensitive information. These are:

        vdslThresh15MinLofs
        vdslThresh15MinLoss
        vdslThresh15MinLprs
        vdslThresh15MinLols
        vdslThresh15MinESs
        vdslThresh15MinSESs
        vdslThresh15MinUASs

   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending 
   them over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide 
   features for such a secure environment.

   Further, notifications generated by agents implementing this MIB
   will contain the above threshold information.  

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View-
   based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.

IANA Considerations 

   The VDSL-LINE-MIB MIB module requires the allocation of a single 
   object identifier for its MODULE-IDENTITY.  IANA should allocate 
   this object identifier in the transmission subtree.
