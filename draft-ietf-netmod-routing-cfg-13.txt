                A YANG Data Model for Routing Management
                    draft-ietf-netmod-routing-cfg-13

Abstract

   This document contains a specification of three YANG modules.
   Together they form the core routing data model which serves as a
   framework for configuring and managing a routing subsystem.  It is
   expected that these modules will be augmented by additional YANG
   modules defining data models for individual routing protocols and
   other related functions.  The core routing data model provides common
   building blocks for such extensions - routing instances, routes,
   routing information bases (RIB), routing protocols and route filters.

Internet-Draft           YANG Routing Management            January 2014


1.  Introduction

   This document contains a specification of the following YANG modules:

   o  Module "ietf-routing" provides generic components of a routing
      data model.

   o  Module "ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing" augments the "ietf-routing"
      module with additional data specific to IPv4 unicast.

   o  Module "ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing" augments the "ietf-routing"
      module with additional data specific to IPv6 unicast, including
      the router configuration variables required by [RFC4861].

   These modules together define the so-called core routing data model,
   which is proposed as a basis for the development of data models for
   configuration and management of more sophisticated routing systems.
   While these three modules can be directly used for simple IP devices
   with static routing (see Appendix B), their main purpose is to
   provide essential building blocks for more complicated setups
   involving multiple routing protocols, multicast routing, additional
   address families, and advanced functions such as route filtering or
   policy routing.  To this end, it is expected that the core routing
   data model will be augmented by numerous modules developed by other
   IETF working groups.

2.  Terminology and Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6241]:

   o  client

   o  message

   o  protocol operation

   o  server

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6020]:

   o  augment

   o  configuration data

   o  data model

   o  data node

   o  feature

   o  mandatory node

   o  module

   o  state data

   o  RPC operation

2.1.  Glossary of New Terms

   active route:  a route that is actually used for sending packets.  If
      there are multiple candidate routes with a matching destination
      prefix, then it is up to the routing algorithm to select the
      active route.

   core routing data model:  YANG data model comprising "ietf-routing",
      "ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing" and "ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing"
      modules.

Internet-Draft           YANG Routing Management            January 2014


   direct route:  a route to a directly connected network.

   routing information base (RIB):  An object containing a list of
      routes together with other information.  See Section 5.3 for
      details.

   system-controlled entry:  An entry of a list in operational state
      data ("config false") that is created by the system independently
      of what has been explicitly configured.  See Section 4.1 for
      details.

   user-controlled entry:  An entry of a list in operational state data
      ("config false") that is created and deleted as a direct
      consequence of certain configuration changes.  See Section 4.1 for
      details.

2.2.  Tree Diagrams

   A simplified graphical representation of the complete data tree is
   presented in Appendix A, and similar diagrams of its various subtrees
   appear in the main text.  The meaning of the symbols in these
   diagrams is as follows:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Curly braces "{" and "}" contain names of optional features that
      make the corresponding node conditional.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write) and "ro" state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node and "*"
      denotes a "list" or "leaf-list".

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

2.3.  Prefixes in Data Node Names

   In this document, names of data nodes, RPC methods and other data
   model objects are often used without a prefix, as long as it is clear
   from the context in which YANG module each name is defined.
   Otherwise, names are prefixed using the standard prefix associated
   with the corresponding YANG module, as shown in Table 1.

3.  Objectives

   The initial design of the core routing data model was driven by the
   following objectives:

   o  The data model should be suitable for the common address families,
      in particular IPv4 and IPv6, and for unicast and multicast
      routing, as well as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS).

   o  Simple routing setups, such as static routing, should be
      configurable in a simple way, ideally without any need to develop
      additional YANG modules.

   o  On the other hand, the core routing framework must allow for
      complicated setups involving multiple routing information bases
      (RIB) and multiple routing protocols, as well as controlled
      redistributions of routing information.

   o  Device vendors will want to map the data models built on this
      generic framework to their proprietary data models and
      configuration interfaces.  Therefore, the framework should be
      flexible enough to facilitate such a mapping and accommodate data
      models with different logic.

4.  The Design of the Core Routing Data Model

   The core routing data model consists of three YANG modules.  The
   first module, "ietf-routing", defines the generic components of a
   routing system.  The other two modules, "ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing"
   and "ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing", augment the "ietf-routing" module
   with additional data nodes that are needed for IPv4 and IPv6 unicast
   routing, respectively.  Figures 1 and 2 show abridged views of the
   configuration and operational state data hierarchies.  See Appendix A
   for the complete data trees.

                Figure 2: Operational state data hierarchy.

   As can be seen from Figures 1 and 2, the core routing data model
   introduces several generic components of a routing framework: routing
   instances, RIBs containing lists of routes, routing protocols and
   route filters.  The following subsections describe these components
   in more detail.

   By combining the components in various ways, and possibly augmenting
   them with appropriate contents defined in other modules, various
   routing systems can be realized.

                Figure 3: Example setup of a routing system

   The example in Figure 3 shows a typical (though certainly not the
   only possible) organization of a more complex routing subsystem for a
   single address family.  Several of its features are worth mentioning:

   o  Along with the default RIB, which is always present, an additional
      RIB is configured.

   o  Each routing protocol instance, including the "static" and
      "direct" pseudo-protocols, is connected to exactly one RIB with
      which it can exchange routes (in both directions, except for the
      "static" and "direct" pseudo-protocols).

   o  RIBs may also be connected to each other and exchange routes in
      either direction (or both).

   o  Route exchanges along all connections may be controlled by means
      of route filters, denoted by "F" in Figure 3.

4.1.  System-Controlled and User-Controlled List Entries

   The core routing data model defines several lists, for example
   "routing-instance" or "rib", that have to be populated with at least
   one entry in any properly functioning device, and additional entries
   may be configured by the user.

   In such a list, the server creates the required item as a so-called



Lhotka                    Expires July 14, 2014                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft           YANG Routing Management            January 2014


   system-controlled entry in operational state data, i.e., inside the
   "routing-state" container.

   Additional entries may be created in the configuration by the user
   via the NETCONF protocol.  These are so-called user-controlled
   entries.  If the server accepts a configured user-controlled entry,
   then this entry also appears in the operational state version of the
   list.

   Corresponding entries in both versions of the list (in operational
   state data and configuration) have the same value of the list key.

   The user may also provide supplemental configuration of system-
   controlled entries.  To do so, the user creates a new entry in the
   configuration with the desired contents.  In order to bind this entry
   with the corresponding entry in the operational state list, the key
   of the configuration entry has to be set to the same value as the key
   of the state entry.

   An example can be seen in Appendix D: the "/routing-state/
   routing-instance" list has a single system-controlled entry whose
   "name" key has the value "rtr0".  This entry is configured by the
   "/routing/routing-instance" entry whose "name" key is also "rtr0".

   Deleting a user-controlled entry from the configuration list results
   in the removal of the corresponding entry in the operational state
   list.  In contrast, if a system-controlled entry is deleted from the
   configuration list, only the extra configuration specified in that
   entry is removed but the corresponding operational state entry
   remains in the list.

4.2.  Features of Advanced Routers

   The core routing data model attempts to address devices with
   elementary routing functions as well as advanced routers.  For simple
   devices, some parts and options of the data model are not needed and
   would represent unnecessary complications for the implementation.
   Therefore, the core routing data model makes the advanced
   functionality optional by means of two YANG features:

   o  "multiple-ribs" - indicates that the device supports multiple RIBs
      per address family, routing protocols connected to non-default
      RIBs, and RIBs configured as receivers of routes from other RIBs.

   o  "multipath-routes" - indicates that the device supports routes
      with multiple next-hops.

   See the "ietf-routing" module for details.

5.  Basic Building Blocks

   This section describes the essential components of the core routing
   data model.

5.1.  Routing Instance

   Each routing instance in the core routing data model represents a
   logical router.  The exact semantics of this term are left to
   implementations.  For example, routing instances may be completely
   isolated virtual routers or, alternatively, they may internally share
   certain information.

   A routing instance together with its operational state is represented
   as an entry of the list "/routing-state/routing-instance", and
   identified by a unique name.  Configuration of that router instance
   appears as an entry of the list "/routing/routing-instance".

   An implementation MAY support multiple types of logical routers
   simultaneously.  Instances of all routing instance types are
   organized as entries of the same flat "routing-instance" list.  In
   order to discriminate routing instances belonging to different types,
   the "type" leaf is defined as a child of the "routing-instance" node.

   An implementation MAY create one or more system-controlled routing
   instances, and MAY also pose restrictions on allowed routing instance
   types and on the number of supported instances for each type.  For
   example, a simple router implementation may support only one system-
   controlled routing instance of the default type "rt:standard-routing-
   instance" and may not allow creation of any user-controlled
   instances.

   Each network layer interface has to be assigned to one or more
   routing instances in order to be able to participate in packet
   forwarding, routing protocols and other operations of those routing
   instances.  The assignment is accomplished by placing a corresponding
   (system- or user-controlled) entry in the list of routing instance
   interfaces ("rt:interface").  The key of the list entry is the name
   of a configured network layer interface, see the "ietf-interfaces"
   module [YANG-IF].

   In YANG terms, the list of routing instance interfaces is modeled as
   a "list" node rather than "leaf-list" in order to allow for adding,
   via augmentation, other configuration or state data related to the
   corresponding interface.

   Implementations MAY specify additional rules for the assignment of
   interfaces to routing instances.  For example, it may be required



Lhotka                    Expires July 14, 2014                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft           YANG Routing Management            January 2014


   that the sets of interfaces assigned to different routing instances
   be disjoint.

5.1.1.  Parameters of IPv6 Routing Instance Interfaces

   The module "ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing" augments the definition of the
   data node "rt:interface", in both configuration and operational state
   data, with definitions of the following variables as required by
   [RFC4861], sec. 6.2.1:

   o  send-advertisements,

   o  max-rtr-adv-interval,

   o  min-rtr-adv-interval,

   o  managed-flag,

   o  other-config-flag,

   o  link-mtu,

   o  reachable-time,

   o  retrans-timer,

   o  cur-hop-limit,

   o  default-lifetime,

   o  prefix-list: a list of prefixes to be advertised.

      The following parameters are associated with each prefix in the
      list:

      *  valid-lifetime,

      *  on-link-flag,

      *  preferred-lifetime,

      *  autonomous-flag.

   The definitions and descriptions of the above parameters can be found
   in the module "ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing" (Section 9).

   NOTES:

   1.  The "IsRouter" flag, which is also required by [RFC4861], is
       implemented in the "ietf-ip" module [YANG-IP] (leaf "ip:
       forwarding").

   2.  The original specification [RFC4861] allows the implementations
       to decide whether the "valid-lifetime" and "preferred-lifetime"
       parameters remain the same in consecutive advertisements, or
       decrement in real time.  However, the latter behavior seems
       problematic because the values might be reset again to the
       (higher) configured values after a configuration is reloaded.
       Moreover, no implementation is known to use the decrementing
       behavior.  The "ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing" module therefore
       assumes the former behavior with constant values.

5.2.  Route

   Routes are basic elements of information in a routing system.  The
   core routing data model defines only the following minimal set of
   route attributes:

   o  destination prefix: IP prefix specifying the set of destination
      addresses for which the route may be used.  This attribute is
      mandatory.

   o  next-hop or action: outgoing interface, IP address of one or more
      adjacent routers to which a packet should be forwarded, or a
      special action such as discarding the packet.

   The above list of route attributes suffices for a simple static
   routing configuration.  It is expected that future modules defining
   routing protocols will add other route attributes such as metrics or
   preferences.

   Routes and their attributes are used both in configuration data, for
   example as manually configured static routes, and in operational
   state data, for example as entries in RIBs.

5.3.  Routing Information Base (RIB)

   A routing information base (RIB) is a list of routes complemented
   with administrative data, namely:

   o  "source-protocol": type of the routing protocol from which the
      route was originally obtained.

   o  "last-updated": the date and time when the route was last updated,
      or inserted into the RIB.




Lhotka                    Expires July 14, 2014                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft           YANG Routing Management            January 2014


   Each RIB MUST contain only routes of one address family.  In the data
   model, address family is represented with an identity derived from
   the "rt:address-family" base identity.

   In the core routing data model, RIBs are operational state data
   represented as entries of the list "/routing-state/ribs/rib".  The
   contents of RIBs are controlled and manipulated by routing protocol
   operations which may result in route additions, removals and
   modifications.  This also includes manipulations via the "static"
   and/or "direct" pseudo-protocols, see Section 5.4.1.

   RIBs are global, which means that a RIB may be used by any or all
   routing instances.  However, an implementation MAY specify rules and
   restrictions for sharing RIBs among routing instances.

   Each routing instance has, for every supported address family, one
   RIB selected as the so-called default RIB.  This selection is
   recorded in the list "default-rib".  The role of default RIBs is
   explained in Section 5.4.

   Simple router implementations that do not advertise the feature
   "multiple-ribs" will typically create one system-controlled RIB per
   supported address family, and declare it as the default RIB (via a
   system-controlled entry of the "default-rib" list).

5.3.1.  Multiple RIBs per Address Family

   More complex router implementations advertising the "multiple-ribs"
   feature support multiple RIBs per address family that can be used for
   policy routing and other purposes.  Every RIB can then serve as a
   source of routes for other RIBs of the same address family.  To
   achieve this, one or more recipient RIBs may be specified in the
   configuration of the source RIB.  Optionally, a route filter may be
   configured for any or all recipient RIBs.  Such a route filter then
   selects and/or manipulates the routes that are passed between the
   source and recipient RIB.

   A RIB MUST NOT appear among its own recipient RIBs.

5.4.  Routing Protocol

   The core routing data model provides an open-ended framework for
   defining multiple routing protocol instances within a routing
   instance.  Each routing protocol instance MUST be assigned a type,
   which is an identity derived from the "rt:routing-protocol" base
   identity.  The core routing data model defines two identities for the
   direct and static pseudo-protocols (Section 5.4.1).




Lhotka                    Expires July 14, 2014                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft           YANG Routing Management            January 2014


   Each routing protocol instance is connected to exactly one RIB for
   each address family that the routing protocol instance supports.
   Routes learned from the network by a routing protocol are normally
   installed into the connected RIB(s) and, conversely, routes from the
   connected RIB(s) are normally injected into the routing protocol.
   However, routing protocol implementations MAY specify rules that
   restrict this exchange of routes in either direction (or both
   directions).

   On devices supporting the "multiple-ribs" feature, any RIB (system-
   controlled or user-controlled) may be connected to a routing protocol
   instance by configuring a corresponding entry in the "connected-rib"
   list.  If such an entry is not configured for an address family, then
   the default RIB MUST be used as the connected RIB for this address
   family.

   In addition, two independent route filters (see Section 5.5) may be
   configured for each connected RIB to apply user-defined policies
   controlling the exchange of routes in both directions between the
   routing protocol instance and the connected RIB:

   o  import filter controls which routes are passed from the routing
      protocol instance to the connected RIB,

   o  export filter controls which routes the routing protocol instance
      receives from the connected RIB.

   Note that the terms import and export are used from the viewpoint of
   a RIB.

5.4.1.  Routing Pseudo-Protocols

   The core routing data model defines two special routing protocol
   types - "direct" and "static".  Both are in fact pseudo-protocols,
   which means that they are confined to the local device and do not
   exchange any routing information with neighboring routers.  Routes
   from both "direct" and "static" protocol instances are passed to the
   connected RIB (subject to route filters, if any), but an exchange in
   the opposite direction is not allowed.

   Every routing instance MUST implement exactly one instance of the
   "direct" pseudo-protocol type.  It is the source of direct routes for
   all configured address families.  Direct routes are normally supplied
   by the operating system kernel, based on the configuration of network
   interface addresses, see Section 6.2.  The "direct" pseudo-protocol
   MUST always be connected to the default RIBs of all supported address
   families.  Unlike other routing protocol types, this connection
   cannot be changed in the configuration.  Direct routes MAY be

   filtered before they appear in the default RIB.

   A pseudo-protocol of the type "static" allows for specifying routes
   manually.  It MAY be configured in zero or multiple instances,
   although a typical configuration will have exactly one instance per
   routing instance.

   Static routes are configured within the "static-routes" container,
   see Figure 4.

5.4.2.  Defining New Routing Protocols

   It is expected that future YANG modules will create data models for
   additional routing protocol types.  Such a new module has to define
   the protocol-specific configuration and state data, and it has to fit
   it into the core routing framework in the following way:



Lhotka                    Expires July 14, 2014                [Page 20]

Internet-Draft           YANG Routing Management            January 2014


   o  A new identity MUST be defined for the routing protocol and its
      base identity MUST be set to "rt:routing-protocol", or to an
      identity derived from "rt:routing-protocol".

   o  Additional route attributes MAY be defined, preferably in one
      place by means of defining a YANG grouping.  The new attributes
      have to be inserted as state data by augmenting the definitions of
      the nodes

          /rt:ribs/rt:rib/rt:route

      and

          /rt:active-route/rt:output/rt:route,

      and possibly other places in the configuration, state data and RPC
      input or output.

   o  Configuration parameters and/or state data for the new protocol
      can be defined by augmenting the "routing-protocol" data node
      under both "/routing" and "/routing-state".

   o  Per-interface configuration, including activation of the routing
      protocol on individual interfaces, can use references to entries
      in the list of routing instance interfaces (rt:interface).

   By using the "when" statement, the augmented configuration parameters
   and state data specific to the new protocol SHOULD be made
   conditional and valid only if the value of "rt:type" or "rt:source-
   protocol" is equal to the new protocol's identity.  It is also
   RECOMMENDED that protocol-specific data nodes be encapsulated in
   appropriately named containers.

   The above steps are implemented by the example YANG module for the
   RIP routing protocol in Appendix C.

5.5.  Route Filter

   The core routing data model provides a skeleton for defining route
   filters that can be used to restrict the set of routes being
   exchanged between a routing protocol instance and a connected RIB, or
   between a source and a recipient RIB.  Route filters may also
   manipulate routes, i.e., add, delete, or modify their attributes.

   Route filters are global, which means that a configured route filter
   may be used by any or all routing instances.  However, an
   implementation MAY specify rules and restrictions for sharing route
   filters among routing instances.

Internet-Draft           YANG Routing Management            January 2014


   By itself, the route filtering framework defined in this document
   allows for applying only two extreme routing policies which are
   represented by the following pre-defined route filter types:

   o  "deny-all-route-filter": all routes are blocked,

   o  "allow-all-route-filter": all routes are permitted.

   The latter type is equivalent to no route filter.

   It is expected that more comprehensive route filtering frameworks
   will be developed separately.

   Each route filter is identified by a unique name.  Its type MUST be
   specified by the "type" identity reference - this opens the space for
   multiple route filtering framework implementations.

5.6.  RPC Operations

   The "ietf-routing" module defines two RPC operations:

   o  active-route: query a routing instance for the active route that
      is currently used for sending datagrams to a destination host
      whose address is passed as an input parameter.

   o  route-count: retrieve the total number of entries in a RIB.

6.  Interactions with Other YANG Modules

   The semantics of the core routing data model also depend on several
   configuration parameters that are defined in other YANG modules.

6.1.  Module "ietf-interfaces"

   The following boolean switch is defined in the "ietf-interfaces" YANG
   module [YANG-IF]:

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/if:enabled

      If this switch is set to "false" for a network layer interface,
      the device MUST behave exactly as if that interface was not
      assigned to any routing instance at all.

6.2.  Module "ietf-ip"

   The following boolean switches are defined in the "ietf-ip" YANG
   module [YANG-IP]:

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv4/ip:enabled

      If this switch is set to "false" for a network layer interface,
      then all IPv4 routing functions related to that interface MUST be
      disabled.

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv4/ip:forwarding

      If this switch is set to "false" for a network layer interface,
      then the forwarding of IPv4 datagrams to and from this interface
      MUST be disabled.  However, the interface may participate in other
      IPv4 routing functions, such as routing protocols.

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv6/ip:enabled

      If this switch is set to "false" for a network layer interface,
      then all IPv6 routing functions related to that interface MUST be
      disabled.

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv6/ip:forwarding

      If this switch is set to "false" for a network layer interface,
      then the forwarding of IPv6 datagrams to and from this interface
      MUST be disabled.  However, the interface may participate in other
      IPv6 routing functions, such as routing protocols.

   In addition, the "ietf-ip" module allows for configuring IPv4 and

   IPv6 addresses and network prefixes or masks on network layer
   interfaces.  Configuration of these parameters on an enabled
   interface MUST result in an immediate creation of the corresponding

11.  Security Considerations

   Configuration and state data conforming to the core routing data
   model (defined in this document) are designed to be accessed via the
   NETCONF protocol [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure
   transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is
   SSH [RFC6242].

   A number of data nodes defined in the YANG modules belonging to the
   configuration part of the core routing data model are writable/
   creatable/deletable (i.e., "config true" in YANG terms, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations to these data nodes,
   such as "edit-config", can have negative effects on the network if
   the protocol operations are not properly protected.

   The vulnerable "config true" subtrees and data nodes are the
   following:

   /routing/routing-instance/interfaces/interface  This list assigns a
      network layer interface to a routing instance and may also specify
      interface parameters related to routing.

   /routing/routing-instance/routing-protocols/routing-protocol  This
      list specifies the routing protocols configured on a device.

   /routing/route-filters/route-filter  This list specifies the
      configured route filters which represent administrative policies
      for redistributing and modifying routing information.

   /routing/ribs/rib  This list specifies the RIBs configured for the
      device.

   Unauthorized access to any of these lists can adversely affect the
   routing subsystem of both the local device and the network.  This may
   lead to network malfunctions, delivery of packets to inappropriate
   destinations and other problems.

Appendix B.  Minimum Implementation

   Some parts and options of the core routing model, such as route
   filters or multiple routing tables, are intended only for advanced
   routers.  This appendix gives basic non-normative guidelines for
   implementing a bare minimum of available functions.  Such an
   implementation may be used for hosts or very simple routers.

   A minimum implementation will provide a single system-controlled
   routing instance, and will not allow clients to create any user-
   controlled instances.

   Typically, neither of the features defined in the "ietf-routing"
   module ("multiple-ribs" and "multipath-routes") will be supported.
   This means that:

   o  A single system-controlled RIB (routing table) is available for
      each supported address family - IPv4, IPv6 or both.  These RIBs
      are the default RIBs, so they will also appear as system-
      controlled entries of the "default-rib" list in operational state
      data.  No user-controlled RIBs are allowed.

   o  Each route has no more than one "next-hop", "outgoing-interface"
      or "special-next-hop".

   In addition to the mandatory instance of the "direct" pseudo-
   protocol, a minimum implementation should support configured
   instance(s) of the "static" pseudo-protocol.  Even with a single RIB
   per address family, it may be occasionally useful to be able to
   configure multiple "static" instances.  For example, a client may
   want to configure alternative sets of static routes and activate or
   deactivate them by means of configuring appropriate route filters
   ("allow-all-route-filter" or "deny-all-route-filter").

   Platforms with severely constrained resources may use deviations for
   restricting the data model, e.g., limiting the number of "static"
   routing protocol instances, preventing any route filters to be
   configured etc.

Appendix C.  Example: Adding a New Routing Protocol

   This appendix demonstrates how the core routing data model can be
   extended to support a new routing protocol.  The YANG module
   "example-rip" shown below is intended only as an illustration rather
   than a real definition of a data model for the RIP routing protocol.
   For the sake of brevity, we do not follow all the guidelines
   specified in [RFC6087].  See also Section 5.4.2.

   module example-rip {

     namespace "http://example.com/rip";

     prefix "rip";

     import ietf-routing {
       prefix "rt";
     }

     identity rip {
       base rt:routing-protocol;
       description
         "Identity for the RIP routing protocol.";
     }

     typedef rip-metric {
       type uint8 {
         range "0..16";
       }
     }

     grouping route-content {
       description
         "This grouping defines RIP-specific route attributes.";
       leaf metric {
         type rip-metric;
       }
       leaf tag {
         type uint16;
         default "0";
         description
           "This leaf may be used to carry additional info, e.g. AS
            number.";
       }
     }

       when "rt:source-protocol = 'rip:rip'" {

Appendix D.  Example: NETCONF <get> Reply

   This section contains a sample reply to the NETCONF <get> message,
   which could be sent by a server supporting (i.e., advertising them in
   the NETCONF <hello> message) the following YANG modules:

   o  ietf-interfaces [YANG-IF],

   o  ietf-ip [YANG-IP],

   o  ietf-routing (Section 7),

   o  ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing (Section 8),

   o  ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing (Section 9).

   We assume a simple network setup as shown in Figure 5: router "A"
   uses static default routes with the "ISP" router as the next-hop.
   IPv6 router advertisements are configured only on the "eth1"
   interface and disabled on the upstream "eth0" interface.

                   +-----------------+
                   |                 |
                   |    Router ISP   |
                   |                 |
                   +--------+--------+
                            |2001:db8:0:1::2
                            |192.0.2.2
                            |
                            |
                            |2001:db8:0:1::1
                        eth0|192.0.2.1
                   +--------+--------+
                   |                 |
                   |     Router A    |
                   |                 |
                   +--------+--------+
                        eth1|198.51.100.1
                            |2001:db8:0:2::1
                            |

                  Figure 5: Example network configuration

   A reply to the NETCONF <get> message sent by router "A" would then be
   as follows:

  <?xml version="1.0"?>

Appendix E.  Change Log

   RFC Editor: remove this section upon publication as an RFC.

E.1.  Changes Between Versions -12 and -13

   o  Wrote appendix about minimum implementation.

   o  Remove "when" statement for IPv6 router interface operational
      state - it was dependent on a config value that may not be
      present.

   o  Extra container for the next-hop list.

   o  Names rather than numeric ids are used for referring to list
      entries in operational state.

   o  Numeric ids are always declared as mandatory and unique.  Their
      description states that they are ephemeral.

   o  Descriptions of "name" keys in operational state lists are
      required to be persistent.

   o

   o  Removed "if-feature multiple-ribs;" from connected-ribs.

   o  "rib-name" instead of "name" is used as the name of leafref nodes.

   o  "next-hop" instead of "nexthop" or "gateway" used throughout, both
      in node names and text.

E.2.  Changes Between Versions -11 and -12

   o  Removed feature "advanced-router" and introduced two features
      instead: "multiple-ribs" and "multipath-routes".

   o  Unified the keys of config and state versions of "routing-
      instance" and "rib" lists.

   o  Numerical identifiers of state list entries are not keys anymore,
      but they are constrained using the "unique" statement.

   o  Updated acknowledgements.

E.3.  Changes Between Versions -10 and -11

   o  Migrated address families from IANA enumerations to identities.

      route, nexthop.

   o  Described the relationship between system-controlled and user-
      controlled list entries.

   o  Feature "user-defined-routing-tables" changed into "advanced-
      router".

   o  Made nexthop into a choice in order to allow for nexthop-list
      (I2RS requirement).

      is used as the value of "location", and "forwarding" is on for
      both interfaces and both IPv4 and IPv6.

   o  The "must" expression for "main-routing-table" was modified to
      avoid redundant error messages reporting address family mismatch
      when "name" points to a non-existent routing table.

   o  Complete data tree is now in Appendix A.

   o  Changed type of "source-protocol" from "leafref" to "string".

   o  Clarified the relationship between routing protocol instances and
      connected routing tables.

   o  Added a must constraint saying that a routing table connected to
      the direct pseudo-protocol must not be a main routing table.

E.9.  Changes Between Versions -04 and -05

   o  Routing tables are now global, i.e., "routing-tables" is a child
      of "routing" rather than "router".

   o  "must" statement for "static-routes" changed to "when".

   o  Added "main-routing-tables" containing references to main routing
      tables for each address family.

   o  Removed the defaults for "address-family" and "safi" and made them
      mandatory.

   o  Removed the default for route-filter/type and made this leaf
      mandatory.

   o  If there is no active route for a given destination, the "active-
      route" RPC returns no output.

   o  Added "enabled" switch under "routing-protocol".

   o  Added "router-type" identity and "type" leaf under "router".

   o  Route attribute "age" changed to "last-updated", its type is
      "yang:date-and-time".

   o  The "direct" pseudo-protocol is always connected to main routing
      tables.

   o  Entries in the list of connected routing tables renamed from
      "routing-table" to "connected-routing-table".

   o  Added "must" constraint saying that a routing table must not be
      its own recipient.

E.10.  Changes Between Versions -03 and -04

   o  Changed "error-tag" for both RPC methods from "missing element" to
      "data-missing".

   o  Removed the decrementing behavior for advertised IPv6 prefix
      parameters "valid-lifetime" and "preferred-lifetime".

   o  Changed the key of the static route lists from "seqno" to "id"
      because the routes needn't be sorted.

   o  Added 'must' constraint saying that "preferred-lifetime" must not
      be greater than "valid-lifetime".
