Internet-Draft               MMOX Use Cases                   March 2009


   Based on actual need identified by interaction with various customers
   when working on virtual world interoperability over the last four
   years, this draft summarizes the main interoperability functions
   required to satisfy those needs.  From these use cases, requirements
   for the MMOX virtual world interoperability charter can be derived.

Internet-Draft               MMOX Use Cases                   March 2009


1.  Introduction

   Over the past four years, Forterra Systems has worked with various
   customers to interoperate the OLIVE virtual world platform with
   various external systems, ranging from simple extraction-and-analysis
   tools up to full-on virtual world simulation interoperability.  Based
   on this experience, the following five use cases have been extracted
   and presented for consideration as one basis from which to derive
   requirements for future vendor-neutral interoperability work.  The
   use cases are formulated to clearly show the actions and affordances
   expected to be visible to end users, as well as showing what value
   interoperability brings to the table, as opposed to features
   implemented in a system specific manner.


2.  Use Cases

2.1.  Friend Invite

2.1.1.  Description

   1.  User A uses virtual world system A that complies with MMOX
       simulation interoperability.
   2.  User B uses virtual world system B that complies with MMOX
       simulation interoperability.
   3.  User A wants user B to visit him/her in system/world A, and gets
       a suitable URL from his/her system (A), and sends this to user B
       using any transport (mail, IM, integrated communication, carrier
       pigeon, ...)
   4.  User B clicks/activates this link.
   5.  After a brief "loading" screen, user B sees user A in user A's
       environment, including a representative form of any simulated
       object in that environment.
   6.  User B can interact at some level with the objects from user A.
   7.  Objects that user B take out of inventory show up in some
       representative form for both user A and user B.
   8.  User A can interact at some level with any objects that user B
       bring out of inventory.

2.1.2.  Benefits

   The benefit is that users of different virtual worlds can invite and
   communicate with each other using the virtual world metaphore,
   regardless of the particular virtual world technology used for their
   "home base" virtual world.

Internet-Draft               MMOX Use Cases                   March 2009


2.2.  Collaborative Training

2.2.1.  Description

   1.   Company A operates a chemical plant in city B. Company A uses
        virtual world system A to do simulation/training/
        command-and-control of its plant.
   2.   City B has an emergency response organization that uses virtual
        world system B for training and scenario planning.
   3.   At a defined time, company A and city B agree to connect their
        worlds for a defined duration to conduct a training excercise
        related to a fire in the chemical plant.
   4.   At the defined time, a representation of the detailed model/
        simulation of the chemical plant shows up at the right address
        in the virutal world for the city workers.
   5.   At the defined time, city workers (ambulances, fire trucks, etc)
        become visible to the chemical plant workers.
   6.   Interactions between users of the systems include conversations
        (voice, simulated radio, PSTN).
   7.   Interactions between users of the systems include a display of
        the fire as it propagates based on company A simulation models.
   8.   Interactions between users of the systems include the ability
        for firefighters to pour water (or other agents) onto the fire,
        and have the simulation respond.
   9.   Interactions between users of the systems include the ability
        for city workers to load a chemical plant worker into a city
        ambulance.
   10.  At the pre-determined time, the interoperability ends; the city
        disappears from the company plant, and the company plant
        disappears from the city model.
   11.  Session record/review capability used by the city in virtual
        world B includes all communications and interactions made in the
        system including those internal to company/world A.

2.2.2.  Benefits

   The benefit, in addition to the Friend Invite use case, is that
   interoperability can be limited in time and (virtual) space to
   protect potentially sensitive information.  Additionally, this use
   case shows the benefit of defining interactions between objects
   operated by one system with objects operated by another system,
   leading to synergistic simulation similar to that evidenced by the
   DIS protocol, but applicable to a broader, non-military audience.

2.3.  Scene Transfer

Internet-Draft               MMOX Use Cases                   March 2009


2.3.1.  Description

   1.   A user of virtual world A has prototyped an interesting
        environment.
   2.   The user decides to donate that prototype to an organization
        that uses virtual world system B.
   3.   The user "exports" his/her prototype to a series of common data
        containers (textures, meshes, scripts, etc) of some standard
        format (e g COLLADA, X, FLT).
   4.   All content that the user has created and owns (no matter what
        the permission) that is part of the prototype is included in
        sufficient detail in the export.
   5.   All content that is part of the prototype and that A has
        sufficient permission for is included in sufficient detail in
        the export.
   6.   No content that is restricted from this kind of use is included
        in the export, although a reference saying "an object with
        characteristics C named N was here" may be.
   7.   The exported data is attributed (in aggregate) to user A.
   8.   Organization B can load the exported assets into their virtual
        world.
   9.   Meshes and textures in a well-known standard format shows up in
        world B as expected, with attribution to user A, no matter what
        technology the respective virtual worlds use.
   10.  Scripting and interactive behavior shows up only if the
        destination virtual world implements a scripting or behavior
        system compatible with the source world.

2.3.2.  Benefits

   The benefit is that work done to develop virtual world content for
   one world can be transported to another world with minimal manual
   intervention.  While things like scripting and simulation algorithms
   may not transfer over (depending on the degree of implementation
   similarity between source and destination), the main 3D content,
   including meshes, textures and layout, does.  Additionally, such
   transfer is shown to respect intellectual property rights of content
   that may have been re-used to generate the scene.

2.4.  Analysis

2.4.1.  Description

   1.  ISV A creates a system for analyzing movement of avatars in a
       virtual world.
   2.  The product from ISV A can be connected to any virtual world or
       worlds implementing interoperability.

   3.  When the tool is connected, certain patterns of movement are
       detected and flagged by the tool.
   4.  The tool can report recognized actions through chat, or through
       introducing "flag" objects into the world.
   5.  A virtual world user interacting with the "flag" objects can pull
       up a web page that gives information about the detected
       interaction.

2.4.2.  Benefits

   The benefit is that development effort to generate various tools can
   be replicated across multiple virtual worlds, saving a lot of re-
   implementation effort for ISVs interfacing with the virtual worlds
   market.  Additionally, the benefit of a commonly agreed external data
   representation enables formulation of standardized metrics and
   measurements, which is expected to greatly help research into the use
   and evolution of virtual worlds.

2.5.  Data Logger

2.5.1.  Description

   1.  User of virtual world system A purchases a 'data logger' tool
       from company B.
   2.  When attaching the data logger tool to the virtual world, the
       data logger receives information about all the objects,
       interactions and communication in the system.
   3.  After the logger has been detached, the data logger tool can be
       seen as a separate "virtual world peer" and connected to by any
       virtual world using interoperability.
   4.  The logger implements play and shuttle controls that allow the
       action from the original session to be re-played at a later time.
       Any attached virtual world peer will see the recorded actions.
   5.  Enough data is available to the logger that search functions like
       "find the time when avatar X interacted with vehicle Y" can be
       implemented.
   6.  Actions by avatars in the connected peers during playback do not
       affect the objects provided by the logger tool.

2.5.2.  Benefits

   A generally agreed-upon data presentation and interchange standard,
   implemented using server peer-to-peer co-simulation of a shared
   space, enables a large variety of use cases.  The Data Logger is
   interesting in that it shows how data can be both consumed, and
   produced, by systems that are not in themselves virtual worlds, yet
   provide clear benefits to users of virtual worlds.  Like the use case
   Analysis, the ability to do this with any world significantly reduces

   the burden on ISVs.  Additionally, one can consider the potential
   future markets that open up when virtual world record and playback
   (in full 3D, as opposed to a plain video stream) is a deployed, easy-
   to-use, generally applicable capability.


3.  Discussion

   For purposes of these use cases, we can consider cases where "A"
   means "OpenSim" and "B" means "OLIVE," or use cases where "A" means
   Croquet and "B" means "Second Life," or "A" means Project Wonderland
   and "B" means "Multiverse.net" (although representatives from those
   two organizations are not yet participating in MMOX).  The point is
   that interoperability does not require the source and the destination
   to be from the same technology family, use the same simulation
   technology, or even that the clients must understand protocols other
   than those native to the respective simulation system.


4.  Security Considerations

   This document describes possible use cases of virtual world
   interoperability, and does not describe specific security related
   technology.  The implementation of technology to provide
   functionality for these use cases needs to separately consider the
   security implications of such implementation.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This documents does not require any IANA action.
