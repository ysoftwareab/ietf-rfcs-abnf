Internet-Draft        MPLS-TP P2MP share protection           April 2010


1.  Introduction

   this document mainly introduces and describles individually 1:n and
   (1:1)^n protection solution for P2MP service, one scheme is based on
   extending 1:1 protection solution to implement 1:n protection by
   sharing protection resource when there are a few faults or detects in
   a working p2mp path.another scheme is using share P2P protection
   Tunnel can protect and recovery one or more one branch paths of P2MP
   working path when there are some defects and failures in some branch
   paths of p2mp working path to implement (1:1)^n protection. and both
   scheme of protection and recovery can be satisfied and suitable for
   requirement 70 and 67B in RFC 5654; while there only have 1+1 and 1:1
   protection solution for P2MP service in
   draft-ietf-mpls-tp-survive-fwk and
   draft-ietf-mpls-tp-linear-protection-01. if 1+1 protection is only
   used for P2MP service, it must set up a disjoint protection path for
   each working path, so it will be hard and diffcult to maintenance and
   monitor each path. at the same time, since the p2mp service may be
   transported in both working and protection path, doule bandwidth
   resource will be consumed for a p2mp service . so it is very
   necessary to consider sharing protection resource among many working
   paths.

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task
   Force(IETF) / International Telecommunications Union
   Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include
   an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures
   to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport
   network as defined by the ITU-T.

3.  proposed P2MP Share protection solution

   this section mainly clarify two kinds of implementing P2MP share
   protection schemes, the first scheme will apply one P2MP protection
   path to protect n P2MP working paths which may have different source
   and sink nodes .when a working P2MP path has defect , the end nodes
   of P2MP will notify and coordinate the switch state by state control
   packet include PSC or APS. if there is no other higher priority P2MP
   service or control command to need to be protected and recoveryed,
   the defect p2mp service packet will switch into P2MP protect path to
   be sent. and all sink nodes of the defect P2MP path will select
   protection and recovery path to receive P2MP service packets.

   The second scheme will use P2P protect tunnel to protect defect
   branch path of many P2MP working paths, when a failure or defect can
   happened in a branch path of P2MP path . the node which can detect
   the defect or failure will notify and request root node of working
   path or peer node of protection path about the failure message and
   state through in-band or out-of-band return path .so the service will
   switch into protection path or bridge both working path and
   protection path to be carried and transported.and the leaf node of
   the defect branch path will select protection P2P tunnel to receive
   the P2MP service packet. the two schemes of P2MP protection will
   implement 1;N and (1:1)^n protection, and the following section will
   describe the course of protection switching in detail.

3.1.  Scheme 1: 1:n protection

   This solution should be similar to 1:1 protection solution to use one
   protection path to protect many working paths. firstly the P2MP
   protection path will be configured and set up between the protection
   root node and all leaf nodes of protected P2MP paths by static
   configuration or dynamically configuration. and root node of each
   working P2MP path will send detection packet to all its own leaf
   nodes periodly. when a leaf node of branch path can't receive the
   detection packet in a fixed time. the leaf node would generate
   failure notify message packet to notify the root node of the P2MP
   working path or the P2MP protection path by state control packet
   including PSC or APS through in-band or out-of-band return path, when
   the root node of P2MP working path received the failure notify
   message and knew some failure in one or more one branch paths of the
   P2MP path. so it may send protection switch requirement control
   packet to root node of protection path. when the root node of
   protection path received protection switch requirement control packet
   from all other root nodes of defect P2MP working path or leaf nodes
   of defect branch paths. it should be based on the priority of all
   protected P2MP paths and select a P2MP service which is the highest
   priotity among these failure paths to be protected . then the root
   node of protection path will generate a notify message include
   selected P2MP path identifier in state control packet by TLV format
   .the state control packet of the notify message format is as the
   following: .



             0                   1                   2             3

   NOTE:

   P2MP Path ID TLV: a standard TLV frame structure. including Type ,
   Length,and Value, and the value field may be identifier value of P2MP
   path which must have failure and should need to be protected. this
   P2MP Paht ID TLV format is as the following:



        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        |   TYPE   |    Length    |    P2MP Path Identifier value   |

                                 Figure 2



   After the root node of protection path generates the notify message
   packet. it will send the State control packet to the root node of
   each failure p2mp working path and all leaf nodes of the P2MP
   protection path. the root node of each failure p2mp working path
   maybe receive and processe the state control packet. if the p2mp path
   which to be selected to be protected is local node's p2mp service,
   the root node will firstly send the p2mp service packet to the root
   node of protection path. or else, The root node won't do this.  For
   all leaf nodes of protection path, when they received and processed
   the state control packet. they will be based on P2MP Path Identifier
   value to decide whether to receive and process the service packet
   from p2mp protection path in the future.if the leaf node can't be
   sink node of the p2mp service which to be protected , it will not
   process the service packet and abandon the packet. or else, it will
   receive and process the packet.in addtion,the root node of protection
   path still received p2mp service directly from client node.

   the implement in detail as the following figure is 1:2(n=2)
   protection instance.

   For above p2mp topology structure, there are two different p2mp
   services which need to be carried and transported separately by p2mp
   working path 1( r1-p2mp path 1-L1,L2,L3)and p2mp working path 2(r2-
   p2mp path 2-L3,L4) under normal state. one p2mp service will be sent
   and transported to leaf node L1,L2,L3, and another p2mp service will
   be sent and transported to leaf node L3,L4. and a p2mp protection
   path ( P-protection path-L1,L2,L3,L4) is used to protect p2mp working
   path 1 and p2mp working path 2 by static configuration or dynamically
   configuation. and the priority of p2mp working path 1 is higher than
   p2mp working path 2. if there is a failure in separately branch
   path(r1-p2mp path 1-L1) of p2mp working path 1 and branch path(r2-
   p2mp path 2-L3) of p2mp working path 2, leaf node L1 and leaf node L3

   will separately send control Packet of switch requirement to root
   node r1 and root node r2 through return path or control channel. when
   root node r1 and r2 received the packet from leaf node L1 and L3 and
   processed it. and the information of failure path will be notified to
   the root node P of protection path .  The root node P received the
   notify packet and processed it.  As the priority of p2mp working path
   1 is higher than p2mp working path 2. so the root node P of
   protection path will select p2mp working path 1 to be protected, and
   send state control packet include path ID TLV to all leaf
   nodes(L1,L2,L3,L4). when all leaf nodes(L1,L2,L3,L4) received and
   processed the state control packet, As Leaf nodes(L1,L2,L3) is the
   leaf nodes of p2mp working path 1, then they will be ready to receive
   and process the service packet from protection path. but leaf node L4
   is not the leaf node of p2mp working path 1. then it will not be
   ready to receive and process the service packet from protection path.
   and the root node r2 will continue to send their own service packets
   in p2mp working path 2. while the root node r1 will stop to send
   service packet in p2mp working path 1.

   if the 1:n protection mechanism is revertive mode. when the failure
   is clear in p2mp working path 1. the root node r1 will restore back
   to p2mp working path 1 to transport P2MP service packet. or else, the
   root node r1 will not do this.

3.2.  Scheme 2: (1:1)^n protection

   This protection solution can use p2p protection tunnel to protect
   branch path of many p2mp working paths.and these branch paths have
   the same leaf node .  Under normal state, The root node of each p2mp
   working path will send p2mp service packet to its own all leaf nodes
   by p2mp working path .in order to protect each branch path of the
   p2mp working path, A protection p2p LSP tunnel will be set up between
   source protection node and each leaf node of all P2MP working path
   which will be protected by the P2P protection tunnel by staic
   configuration or dynamically configuration .and using only unique
   identifier value include IP multicast address,PW label etc can
   identify which p2mp service is tranported by protection P2P tunnel.
   when some leaf nodes didn't receive the failure detection packet from
   the root node of p2mp wroking path in a fixed time, it would generate
   failure notify packet and send it to the root node of p2mp working
   path and source protection node by return path or control channel.
   when the root node of p2mp working path received the failure notfiy
   packet from its own leaf nodes, it will continue to send p2mp service
   packet in the p2mp working path. if it is necessary , it should
   duplicate p2mp service packet and send to source protection node. at
   the same time. while the source protection node received the failure
   notify packet, it will encapsulate the p2mp service packet from
   client node or the root node of p2mp working path by a unique

   identifier value, then further be encapsulated into p2p protection
   tunnel to send the service packet to the leaf node of failure branch
   path. when branch path of another p2mp working path has the failure
   in the same leaf node at the same time, another p2mp service packet
   will be carried by the same p2p protection LSP to the leaf node too.
   it can implement to share the protection resource of P2P protection
   tunnel; and the max bandwidth resource is equal to sum of bandwidth
   resource of all protected p2mp services.

   the implement in detail as the following figure :

   there are two P2MP working path : P2MP working path LSP 1(R1-P2MP
   Path 1-L1,L2) and P2MP working path LSP 2(R2-P2MP Path 2-L2,L3,L4).in
   addtion,for protecting and recoverying service when the failure
   happened in the P2MP working path, a P2P protection tunnel will be
   pre-configured between each leaf node(L1,L2,L3,L4) and source
   protection node(P).

   leaf node L2,The P2MP service packet from client node or the root
   node(R1,R2) of P2MP working path LSP 1 and LSP 2 will be encapsulated
   by two different unique identifier(IP Multicast address, pw label
   etc) and be trasnported through P2P protection tunnel(P-L2).  The
   leaf node L2 will select the protection path to receive service
   packet. and basis on the unique identifier to judge which p2mp
   service the service packet by P2P protection tunnel is , so that the
   leaf node L2 can process the service packet right

   when the failure is clear , the leaf node L2 will stop to send
   failure notify packet to root node(R1,R2_and source protection
   node_P. and select working path to receive service packet. when the
   source protection node(P) have not received the failure notify packet
   for a fixed time. it would stop to transport service through P2P
   protection tunnel.

3.3.   Conclusion

   The two kinds of p2mp protection solution will individually implement
   1:n and (1:1)^n protection for P2MP service. and fulfil the
   requirement of unidirectional p2mp protection and sharing protection
   resource. but there maybe a few questions for the two protection
   solutions.  We hope other experts provide some comments about the two
   protection solutions for p2mp service.




4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the authentication TLV need further
   study.
