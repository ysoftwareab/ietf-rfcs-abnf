RELTYPE=FINISHTOSTART:  Task-B cannot start until Task-A finishes.
      For example, when sanding is complete, painting can begin.

RELTYPE=FINISHTOFINISH:  Task-B cannot finish before Task-A is
      finished, that is the end of Task-A defines the end of Task-B.
      For example, we start the potatoes, then the meat then the peas
      but they should all be cooked at the same time.


                       ============
                       |  Task-A  |--+

                       ============

                  Figure 2: Finish to finish relationship
RELTYPE=STARTTOFINISH:  The start of Task-A (which occurs after Task-
      B) controls the finish of Task-B.  For example, ticket sales
      (Task-B) end when the game starts (Task-A).


                                        ============

RELTYPE=STARTTOSTART:  The start of Task-A triggers the start of
      Task-B, that is Task-B can start anytime after Task-A starts.


                       ============
                    +--|  Task-A  |

RELTYPE=DEPENDS-ON:  Indicates that the current calendar component
      depends on the referenced calendar component in some manner.  For
      example a task may be blocked waiting on the other, referenced,
      task.

RELTYPE=REFID:  Establishes a reference from the current component to
      components with a REFID property which matches the value given in
      the associated RELATED-TO property.

RELTYPE=CONCEPT:  Establishes a reference from the current component
      to components with a CONCEPT property which matches the value
      given in the associated RELATED-TO property.
