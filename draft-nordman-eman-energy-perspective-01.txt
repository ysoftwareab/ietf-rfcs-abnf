                  Energy perspective on applicability
                draft-nordman-eman-energy-perspective-01

Abstract

   This memo discusses applicability for energy management features to
   various types of devices and buildings.  It describes the variety of
   applications that can use the EMAN energy framework and associated
   MIB modules.  P otential examples are building networks, home energy
   gateway, etc.  Finally, the document will also discuss relationships
   of the framework to other architectures and frameworks (such as
   smartgrid).  The applicability statement will explain the
   relationship between the work in this WG and the other existing
   standards such as those from the IEC, ANSI, DMTF, and others.

1.  Introduction

   The EMAN framework describes functionality for reporting of energy
   information in an Internet Protocol network.  Monitoring is a
   critical first step towards energy management more generally,
   including control.  Other Internet Drafts describe the requirements,
   framework, and implementation of this system.  This document reviews
   how it is expected to be used, and how it relates to other activities
   regarding energy and information technology.

   This document is intended to be useful to a wide set of audiences,
   including those with energy as a primary interest (who do not
   necessarily have any background in networking), the more usual
   network-centric audience in the IETF (who may have not connection to
   energy issues), and many whose knowledge and interest is
   intermediate.

1.1.  Eman overview

   The most basic example of energy management is a single device
   reporting only basic information about its own energy status; these
   "simple devices".  The information is reported directly to a Network
   Management System (NMS).

   The framework also provides additional features for collecting
   information from devices intermediate between the NMS and end-use
   devices.  These intermediate devices ("complex devices") may have
   capabilities for monitoring or control, may serve to collect
   information from many devices for more efficient data transfer, may
   process the data (e.g. by summing across many devices), or any
   combination of these.  The same protocol is used whether the NMS is
   communicating with an intermediate or end use device.  The same
   protocol may be used between an intermediate and end use device.

   This protocol does not define anything about the network management
   system, but only identifies it as the recipient of information.  The
   NMS will commonly have an entire single building as its scope, though
   in some cases will cover only a part of a building, or multiple
   buildings.  Usually the NMS will be scoped to match the reach of the
   local area network it is part of.

   All devices are in scope, whether they are traditional IT products
   like computers or network equipment, or other energy-using devices
   that are only now beginning to get IP connections, such as
   appliances, lighting, and climate control systems.  (Devices that are
   only ever powered by batteries, such as sensor nodes, could use this
   protocol, but are not a target).

Internet-Draft     Energy perspective on applicability        March 2011


   The other eman documents are authoritative for specific technical
   content.

1.2.  Usage overview

   The basic usage of the eman protocol is a building operator
   installing software for collecting eman informatin on an existing
   device in the building, e.g. a personal computer, a server, or piece
   of network equipment.  This software is the Network Management System
   (NMS) for eman; it can be implemented by extending an existing NMS
   that performs other functions, or by software that only deals with
   energy issues.

   The NMS begins by probing the local area network to discover devices
   that respond to eman queries.  It first discovers what devices are on
   the network at all, then determines the subset that implement eman.
   It then requests all information from each eman reporting device;
   much of which is static so does not need to be requested again.

   The NMS then determines how often to query each device for updates to
   the energy information.  This will likely vary by building type and
   device type, and the period could range from monthly to once per
   minute.  The frequency of interrogation is entirely up to the NMS and
   can change dynamically as the NMS deems necessary.  Only a small
   amount of data needs to be provided for the periodic reporting.

   Some devices will fail to report some of the time, either because
   they are in a low-power state which does not include the ability to
   do eman reporting, or because they are portable and only sometimes in
   the building (e.g. a notebook computer).  Occasionally, a device will
   leave the building permanently.

   The NMS needs to periodically scan for new eman devices, and query
   for all devices for characteristics that could in principle change,
   but do so infrequently or never.

   Finally, the NMS will digest the reported information into forms
   readily understood by people.  Esxample include summaries by type of
   device ("energy end uses") based on the reported identity
   information, or by location within the building.  Also, a NMS may
   detect suspected or known anomalous energy usage and highlight that,
   in case it represents equipment malfunction or inefficient or
   insufficient operation.  Electricity pricing is becoming increasingly
   dynamic, so that the simple translation from quantity of energy to
   economic cost is becoming more complex.  The ability of eman to
   enable tracking energy use over time provides for incorporating the
   time dimension of electricity use into both monitoring and control.

2.  Terminology

   This section reviews select terms used in this draft.

2.1.  Building Network

   Traditional IT local networks are made up of entities that provide
   information services.  Future Building Networks will not be separate
   from the IT network, but will incorporate many devices whose primary
   function is not information, such as those that provide light,
   regulate temperature or ventilation, and appliances.  A building
   network is IP-based and enables full inter-operation of IT and non-IT
   devices.

   Traditional building control systems were developed before IP
   networking, often have limited scope in the services they address,
   and are often based on proprietary technologies.

2.2.  Network Management System

   A Network Management System (NMS) is the entity which requests
   information from energy-using devices.  It may be a system which also
   implements other network management functions, or one that only deals
   with energy.  It may be limited to monitoring energy use, or it may
   implement control functions (based on eman, other protocols, or
   both).

2.3.  Energy

   At present, the eman framework only addresses electricity use.  It is
   plausible, and likely, that a future version of it will extend to
   other forms of energy (e.g. methane, steam, and hot/cold water), and
   even to non-energy quantities (e.g. temperature and flow).


3.  Use Contexts

   This section reviews the applications that the framework is intended
   to be suitable for.  These vary according to the nature of devices
   involved, and the institutional environment (building type,
   management approach, and purpose).  The other documents specify
   nothing about the network management system (NMS).

3.1.  Management context

   Buildings vary in scale from those with thousands of occupants, down
   to those with few or even none, with similar ranges in relevant floor
   areas.  Some of these buildings have people with a job function that



Nordman                Expires September 15, 2011               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft     Energy perspective on applicability        March 2011


   specifically covers energy management, and in others, no one actively
   pays attention to the topic.

3.1.1.  Highly managed

   Some network environments are closely monitored for what devices are
   introduced to it, their characteristics and capabilities, and the
   functions they provide; many data centers are managed this way.
   These are more likely to use advanced features of energy management
   technology, including accounting for multiple power supplies for
   products, use of power control, and more attention to power
   distribution.  They also are more likely to be concerned with power
   quality characteristics.

   The NMS in these contexts may be integrated with systems for
   functional control of devices.  For a data center, the primary focus
   is the IT equipment it contains, though the devices that provide
   power (reliability, conditioning, distribution, and/or control) and
   those that do space conditioning are also likely to be monitored
   through the NMS.  Monitoring data may be obtained frequently to
   closely track a dynamic usage environment.

3.1.2.  Loosely managed

   Other environments are not actively managed at all.  Devices enter or
   leave the network on their own terms, and are fundamentally
   autonomous.  Power control is not utilized at all, and the goal of
   the energy management facility is to simply understand what is going
   on, not to actively manage it.  Most residential buildings are an
   example of this type of network, where there is no personnel or
   procedures for active network management.  Power quality and capacity
   are essentially never a concern.

   The NMS in a loosely managed environment should be as automatic as
   possible, so that the user can get useful information with little or
   no effort.  No functional control is involved.  Such environments
   will have a mixture of devices that can report power information as
   well as many that cannot.  The NMS is principally tracking long-term
   trends and so information gathering is usually not frequent.

3.1.3.  Hybrids

   Most network environments have elements of these two extremes, both
   sets of devices of each sort, as well as devices that are managed in
   an intermediate form.  Commercial buildings are commonly of this
   form, with some devices being highly managed, and others only loosely
   tracked.




Nordman                Expires September 15, 2011               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft     Energy perspective on applicability        March 2011


   The NMS for a hybrid must be able to accomodate a diverse set of
   devices and is likely to track some closely, and others much less so.

3.2.  Building types

   The EMAN facility is designed to be used in any building type (though
   the specific needs of industrial buildings have not yet been
   considered).  Core building types are residential, commercial, and
   vehicle.  In the United States, buildings account for just over 70%
   of electricity use, with this split almost evenly between residential
   and commercial.

   The cases of multi-tenant buildings (residential and commercial)
   noted below raise the possibility of a device reporting to more than
   one NMS.

3.2.1.  Residential

   Residential buildings usually have no existing infrastructure for
   reporting energy use of devices within them.  There are products
   available that can monitor and track whole-building use, either from
   added hardware, or by leveraging a communicating meter.  However,
   this gives no visibilty to how much electricity is being consumed by
   each device.  There are expensive systems available for houses that
   integrate control of many systems (e.g. climate control, lighting,
   security, entertainment) that can incorporate tracking of usage times
   and so well approximate energy use, but these are generally
   proprietary and not IP-based.

   Residential buildings that incorporate multiple units are best dealt
   with as each unit being a separate building for NMS purposes.
   Privacy and security both preclude sharing much information outside
   the NMS, except for services that are centrally provided (e.g. hot
   water or space conditioning).  Such buildings also have energy used
   in common areas and for common functions.

   The term Home Energy Gateway is sometimes used to denote a
   demarcation point between devices in a building and the outside
   world.  These gateways can also perform some active monitoring and
   control functions.  There is no need for the architecture of a
   building network to be different in houses from other building types
   so that this is really just a specific example of a building network
   gateway.

3.2.2.  Commercial

   Commercial buildings vary enormously in scale, with some smaller than
   a typical house, to entire campuses of multi-story buildings.



Nordman                Expires September 15, 2011               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft     Energy perspective on applicability        March 2011


   Smaller buildings share many characteristics with houses in terms of
   technology and management styles.  Larger buildings usually have some
   sorts of building control systems, though usually there are several
   systems for individual types of functions, and most are not IP-based.
   Thus, while some energy information can usually be extracted
   digitally, it is usually not comprehensive, and often derived from
   proprietary systems.  With increasing building size, it is more
   likely that someone has energy management as an explicit job
   function.

   Some commercial buildings have the multi-tenant character of some
   residential buildings, though the degree to which services are the
   responsibility of the building owner is usually greater than with
   residential.

3.2.3.  Data Centers

   A data center is technically an industrial building, but for eman
   purposes it has special interest and so is treated separately.  These
   are highly managed environments and are most likely to use the most
   advanced and complex features of eman, and have more sophisticated
   mechanisms for power distribution and control, including use of power
   distribution units.  They are also likely to see the quickest uptake
   of the protocol.  Thus, their importance for eman is out of scale
   with their portion of global electricity use (a few percent).

3.2.4.  Other industrial buildings

   Industrial buildings in general use electricity for both process and
   non-process loads.  Non-process loads are similar to those in other
   building types.  Process loads have not yet been considered in the
   eman process.

3.2.5.  Vehicles

   While it may initially seem curious to treat automobiles, airplanes,
   and boats as types of buildings, for purposes of energy management,
   it is quite appropriate.  They are generally self-contained
   structures with electricity distribution for a variety of uses (some
   infrastructure and some occupant oriented).  Electricity is typically
   more expensive in energy and carbon terms than for fixed buildings
   and may have constrained capacity, so the reason to be concerned with
   energy management is even greater with vehicles.  Many vehicles can
   connect to the electricity grid when stationary.

Internet-Draft     Energy perspective on applicability        March 2011


3.3.  Device types

   The EMAN facility is designed to be used for any device type.  Its
   design and usage specifically takes account of two primary types:
   electronic devices, and all others.

3.3.1.  Information technology

   For many years, the only devices on IP networks were computers and
   network equipment.  To these were added other types of information
   technology devices, such as printers and storage.  These devices are
   at the core of EMAN and will see the widest initial use of EMAN
   reporting.

3.3.2.  Other electronic devices

   Information technology is a specific subset of the general category
   of "electronic" devices - those which have information as their
   primary function.  Even televisions have a primary purpose of
   displaying information, and thus the traditional category of
   entertainment consumer electronics can be logically grouped under
   information technology.  These devices are seeing rapid uptake of IP
   connectivity, and the distinction between IT and other electronic
   devices blurring.

3.3.3.  Non-electronic devices

   "Electronics" are devices whose primary function is information so
   that "non-electronics" is everything else in buildings, such as
   lighting, appliances, and equipment for space conditioning.  This
   term does not imply that they have no electronic components.


4.  Other topics

   This section explores other topics relevant to energy management and
   eman.

4.1.  Power distribution

   An aspect of energy reporting that may not be initially apparent is
   how it can support understanding of power distribution systems.  That
   is, different collections of devices in a building may be in
   different 'domains' of electricity distribution, with a common fate
   (e.g. downstream of a circuit breaker), or under the same electricity
   meter.  This is accomplished two ways: via reporting by products
   which have a power distribution function themselves (e.g. a Power
   Distribution Unit or an Ethernet switch that supports Power over



Nordman                Expires September 15, 2011              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft     Energy perspective on applicability        March 2011


   Ethernet), or by products self-identifying the domain they are a part
   of (usually by manual configuration).

   In the past, few buildings had complex power distribution, with most
   simply a tree of circuit breakers, and just a few levels of AC power
   utilized.  Today, an increasing number have additional features, such
   as uninterruptable power supplies, low-voltage DC powered devices,
   local generation, and storage.  Power reporting mechanisms such as
   eman will need to have some understanding of these features.

4.2.  Discovery

   A Network Management System requires some method of collecting a list
   of the entities on the network that it needs to be cognizant of, both
   when it initially begins operation, and maintaining this on an
   ongoing basis as the population of devices evolves.  There are three
   basic methods: protocol, manual, and opportunistic.  A NMS can
   utilize more than one method.

   In the protocol approach, the NMS periodically broadcasts a request
   for any EMAN reporting entity to identify itself to the NMS.  For
   each entity that replies, the NMS queries it for the specific
   information it has.

   In the manual approach, the identity of each device to be managed is
   provided to the NMS.  Usually, additional information will also be
   provided, such as functional relationships among devices, policies to
   be employed (e.g. prioritization of the importance of each device),
   and control strategies (e.g. under what conditions a device should be
   have its power supply removed or reinstated).

   In the opportunistic approach, the NMS observes the network to notice
   when a new device appears, then queries it for EMAN capabilities.

   A NMS may also participate in one or more service discovery protocols
   to determine when a new device appears, though as none of these
   protocols are universal, this will always be an incomplete method.  A
   NMS also has to deal with the fact that some devices will eventually
   disappear from the network and need to be expired from its databases.
   Also, some devices will be only intermittently on the network, either
   from being physically absent some of the time, or powered down to a
   low-power state in which they can't respond to EMAN queries.

4.3.  Identity

   Eman needs to report basic characteristics of the "identity" of a
   device for the NMS to know how to interpret the information.  That
   is, while the IP and MAC addresses of a device are essential to know,



Nordman                Expires September 15, 2011              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft     Energy perspective on applicability        March 2011


   they are by no means sufficient.  Other aspects of identity include
   what a device is (a general category as a person would describe it),
   its brand and model, and a locally determined name useful for
   building occupants.


5.  Related Standards and Activities

   This section reviews related standards and other activities that have
   some relationship to the EMAN protocol.  A key point is that eman
   reports data on individual devices.  Many standards are oriented to
   entire buildings or other large entities.

5.1.  Standards that inform measurement

   There are many energy test procedures for specific products.  These
   generally are for tests conducted in laboratory conditions in
   specified configurations to assess energy performance for comparison
   to other models or criteria levels.  However, EMAN measurements are
   not conducted in a laboratory, not under such specified conditions,
   and need to be universal across all products, so a "horizontal" test
   procedure is more relevant.  The most widely used of these is IEC
   62301 [IEC-62301] on measurement of standby power .  While 62301 was
   created by a committee with a mandate on household appliances, it has
   been designed to be universal for any product commonly found in
   residential or commercial buildings, and is referenced in test
   procedures for appliances, electronics, and other devices.  It was
   originally published in 2005, with a second edition finalized in
   2011.

5.2.  Standards that inform reporting

   Energy reporting over networks is a relatively new service.  Few
   devices had the hardware ability to measure power, and few of the
   rest made an attempt to estimate it.  Further, for power state,
   devices could only report when they were fully on, so never could
   report themselves when in a low power state.  Finally, the ability to
   remotely apply or remove power from a device has been confined to
   very specific usage environments.

5.2.1.  DMTF

   The Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) has specified
   communication of power state information.

   The DMTF Common Information Model (CIM) includes information about
   power states.

5.2.2.  Ecma SDC

   The Ecma International committee on Smart Data Centre (TC38-SDC
   [Ecma-SDC]) is in the process of defining semantics for management of
   entities in a data center such as servers, storage, network
   equipment, etc.  It covers energy as one of many functional resources
   or attributes of systems for measurement and/or control.  It only
   defines terms and variables, and does not reference any specific
   protocol.  Its goal is to enable interoperability of such protocols
   by ensuring a common semantic model across them.

   The SDC process is still underway, with a timeframe similar to EMAN.
   There seems to be no fundamental barrier to the two efforts to
   harmonize on aspects they have in common.  These include identity,
   power states, power levels, accumulated energy use, and tracking of
   time.

5.3.  Other Standards and Activities

   While manufacturers may implement EMAN capabilities in their
   products, their are other organizations that may also do this.
   Future standards may reference EMAN as functionality that more
   comprehensive systems rely on (e.g. using reported power state for
   functional purposes).  They may also define extensions to or
   particular uses of the EMAN facility.

   In future, energy standards, both voluntary and mandatory, may reward
   or require use of EMAN capabilities.  For example, the Energy Star
   program already references other specific network technologies in a
   variety of its specifications.  In fact, the initial framework
   document for revising the Energy Star Computer specification [ESTAR]
   references the IETF eman activity .  The most likely use of EMAN
   would be simply for a device to be able to report on its own basic
   status as defined by EMAN, such as identity, power state, power
   level, and accumulated energy.

5.3.1.  Smart Grid

   There are many definitions of what constitutes the "Smart Grid".  In
   the most general sense, it is the application of information
   technology to our electricity system, so that the EMAN framework is
   an excellent example of that.  Alternatively, it can describe using
   information technology to improve the electricity grid, from the
   power plant through transmission and distribution systems and ending
   at the meter.  In this case, the EMAN framework has no connection to
   the Smart Grid.  The most common definitions of the Smart Grid
   acknowledge that what occurs in buildings is different from the
   utility-managed grid, but specify some communication directly between

   the grid and end-use devices.  The EMAN framework does not anticipate
   communication with entities outside the building, but rather only
   with a local NMS.  The NMS could communicate with the grid, but that
   is well outside the EMAN scope and framework.  End-use devices can
   still coordinate with the grid through other protocols, either in
   one-way communication (receiving demand response or direct price
   signals from the grid), or in two-way communication with the grid.


6.  Security Considerations

   The energy management facilities discussed here raise a number of
   security considerations.  While not a part of the current drafts, the
   ability of one device to control the power state of a second
   connected device can be a problem if they do not share the same
   management goal.  This can be either the act of powering down a
   device (e.g. from on to sleep or off), rendering it unable to perform
   ordinary services it might otherwise accomplish, or powering the
   device up, and consequently using energy resources not otherwise
   desired.  Beyond control, simple information about the current or
   historic energy use of a device can indicate details of occupancy of
   the main person using the device, or of applications running on the
   device.

   The capabilities described in this document do not introduce any new
   capabilities for security.  Rather, any device that implements them
   must use existing security intrastructure and policies.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This memo creates several possible actions for IANA.  First is a
   single canonical listing of "identity" of a device, in terms of what
   it is.  Second is possible enumeration of power states, and/or
   functional states.
