4.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        RFC 1155 [RFC1155], RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215 [RFC1215].
        The second version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 2578
        [RFC2578], RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second version of the SNMP

        message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901]
        and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the message
        protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906],
        RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second set of protocol
        operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
        [RFC1905].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
        in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

5.  Overview

There is a need for a standardized way of retrieving the conformance and
variance information associated with the managed objects support by a
particular agent.

Conformance Statements for SMIv2 [RFC2580] provides the MODULE-
COMPLIANCE macro, which allows the MIB writer to define different
conformance levels, in order to specify various subsets of the full
functionality defined in the MIB module, or allow for new versions of
the MIB module.  Unfortunately, an NMS application developer cannot
easily determine the exact conformance level by any given agent

implementation, even those that are following the standard correctly.
For example, it is not always easy to determine which version of a MIB
module is implemented, or if an agent implements the full semantics of
an object or the semantics refined by one of potentially several OBJECT
clauses (in different MODULE-COMPLIANCE macros).

The AGENT-CAPABILITIES macro allows an SNMP developer to determine
conformance information for specific objects for a particular release of
a particular product.  Unfortunately, this information is not available
in any form from the agent. Instead, it is maintained as a text file by
the network administrator.  The sysORTable [RFC1907] allows an agent to
advertise which AGENT-CAPABILITIES macros are supported, but this is
insufficient because these macros are stored in external files, and
since they are optional, agent developers are not required to provide
these files.

5.1.  MIB Structure

The Conformance MIB contains a single group of conformance objects,
which contains a single scalar, called 'confLastUpdateTime', and a
single table, called the 'confTable'.

The 'confLastUpdateTime' allows an NMS application to determine if the
contents of the 'confTable' have changed over time.  The 'confTable'
identifies conformance and variance information for a specified MIB sub-
tree. If multiple (overlapping) entries exist for a particular portion
of the MIB sub-tree, then the most specific entry (i.e. longest match)
has precedence.  The following objects are contained in the 'confTable':

confModuleCompliance
     An OID pointer to MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro pertaining to the set of
     objects, as implemented by the agent.

confLevel
     An enumerated integer describing the basic conformance level to the
     specification for the set of objects, as implemented by the agent.

confVarSyntax
     A string describing the semantic variation for a set of MIB objects
     or a single MIB object. This usually consists of the SYNTAX clause
     within the the VARIATION clause that would be present in an AGENT-
     CAPABILITIES macro for the specified object, or the SYNTAX, WRITE-
     SYNTAX and/or MIN-ACCESS clauses that would be present in the
     OBJECT macro within a MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro.

ConformanceLevel ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION
            "An indication of the conformance level for a particular set
            of MIB objects.

            The value 'noConf' indicates that the agent does not
            implement any of the required semantics for the associated
            set of objects.  Usually this means the object is not
            implemented at all.  However, it also indicates the special
            case in which incorrect values are returned, e.g., counter
            objects that always return zero, string objects that always
            return a zero-length string (but should not), hard-wired
            (potentially incorrect) enumerations or gauges.

            The value 'otherConf' indicates that the implementation
            complies with the semantics of the associated set of objects
            in a manner that varies from the specification in some way.

            The value 'minConf' indicates that the implementation
            complies with the semantics of the associated set of objects
            as refined by a GROUP clause or an OBJECT clause within a
            MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro.

            The value 'fullConf' indicates that the implementation
            complies with the semantics of the associated set of objects
            as defined by an indicated compliance statement for the set
            of objects.

            The value 'completeConf' indicates that the implementation
            complies with the full semantics of the associated set of
            objects as defined by the data definitions for the objects.
            This may be greater than than the conformance level
            indicated by the 'fullConf' enumeration if the indicated
            compliance statement does not require full implementation of
            the entire set of objects."

7.  Appendix A: Conformance Information Usage Examples

The Interfaces MIB [RFC2233][RFC2863] is used to demonstrate some
possible applications of the Conformance MIB.

7.1.  Full Conformance

This example shows full conformance to the RFC 2863 version of the
Interfaces MIB. Note that the MODULE-COMPLIANCE allows many objects to
be omitted, as specified by the various GROUP macros.  The enumeration
'fullConf' indicates that the full implementation of all mandatory
objects is supported, even if OBJECT clauses exist for some mandatory
objects.

 - confTable entry for the entire IF-MIB:
    - confSubTree INDEX == { ifMIB 1 }
    - confModuleCompliance == { ifCompliance3 }
    - confLevel == 'fullConf(4)'
    - confVarSyntax == noSuchInstance (or empty string)

7.2.  Full Conformance with some Optional Groups

This example shows full conformance to the RFC 2863 version of the
Interfaces MIB. In this example, the agent supports the groups required
for character-oriented interfaces with ifSpeed values not exceeding
20,000,000 bits/second.

 - confTable entry for the entire IF-MIB:
    - confSubTree INDEX == { ifMIB 1 }
    - confModuleCompliance == { ifCompliance3 }
    - confLevel == 'fullConf(4)'
    - confVarSyntax == 'GROUP ifFixedLengthGroup'

7.3.  Previous Revision Conformance

This example shows full conformance to the RFC 2233 version of the
Interfaces MIB. In this example, the agent supports all the mandatory
groups, and supports the group for high capacity packet based
interfaces.

Interfaces MIB. In this example, the agent supports all the mandatory
groups and all the optional groups, however, the deprecated ifTestTable
is not implemented.

 - confTable entry for the entire IF-MIB:
    - confSubTree INDEX == { ifMIB 1 }
    - confModuleCompliance == { ifCompliance3 }
    - confLevel == 'completeConf(5)'
    - confVarSyntax == noSuchInstance (or empty string)

 - confTable entry for the ifTestTable:
    - confSubTree INDEX == { ifMIBObjects 3 }
    - confModuleCompliance == { ifCompliance3 }
    - confLevel == 'noConf(1)'
    - confVarSyntax == noSuchInstance (or empty string)

7.5.  Partial Conformance (II)

This example shows full conformance to the RFC 2863 version of the
ifTable and ifXTable, except for the ifTable non-unicast packet
counters, which are not implemented at all.

 - confTable entry for the ifTable:
    - confSubTree INDEX == { interfaces 2 }
    - confModuleCompliance == { ifCompliance3 }
    - confLevel == 'fullConf(4)'
    - confVarSyntax == noSuchInstance (or empty string)

 - confTable entry for the ifXTable:
    - confSubTree INDEX == { ifMIBObjects 1 }
    - confModuleCompliance == { ifCompliance3 }
    - confLevel == 'fullConf(4)'
    - confVarSyntax == noSuchInstance (or empty string)

 - confTable entry for the ifInNUcastPkts:
    - confSubTree INDEX == { ifEntry 12 }

    - confModuleCompliance == { ifCompliance3 }
    - confLevel == 'noConf(1)'
    - confVarSyntax == noSuchInstance (or empty string)

 - confTable entry for the ifOutNUcastPkts:
    - confSubTree INDEX == { ifEntry 18 }
    - confModuleCompliance == { ifCompliance3 }
    - confLevel == 'noConf(1)'
    - confVarSyntax == noSuchInstance (or empty string)

7.6.  Minimum Conformance

This example shows minimum conformance to the RFC 2863 version of the
ifTable.  In this example, the agent supports all the mandatory objects,
except the table is implemented as read-only.

 - confTable entry for the ifTable:
    - confSubTree INDEX == { interfaces 2 }
    - confModuleCompliance == { ifCompliance3 }
    - confLevel == 'minConf(3)'
    - confVarSyntax == 'MIN-ACCESS read-only'

7.7.  Other Conformance

This example shows full conformance to the RFC 2863 version of the
ifXTable, except the ifAlias object, which is implemented as a read-
write 32 octet string, instead of a read-write 64 octet string.

 - confTable entry for the ifXTable:
    - confSubTree INDEX == { ifMIBObjects 1 }
    - confModuleCompliance == { ifCompliance3 }
    - confLevel == 'fullConf(4)'
    - confVarSyntax == noSuchInstance (or empty string)

 - confTable entry for ifAlias:
    - confSubTree INDEX == { ifXEntry 18 }
    - confModuleCompliance == { ifCompliance3 }
    - confLevel == 'otherConf(2)'
    - confVarSyntax == 'SYNTAX DisplayString (SIZE(0..32))'

8.  Open Issues

Conformance information for INDEX components
     Should the confTable be modified to support entries for INDEX
     components, which are not actually represented in MODULE-COMPLIANCE

     macros?

Default confTable behavior
     Should the absence of a confEntry indicate any particular
     semantics?

Missing conformance sections
     MODULE-COMPLIANCE sections are not strictly mandatory, but this MIB
     gets around this corner-case (and the missing conformance
     information for INDEX components) by describing the conformance
     information that would be present in an information module, even if
     that information is not actually present.  Are there any problems
     with this approach?

11.  Security Considerations

There are no managed objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX-ACCESS
clause of read-write and/or read-create.

There are no managed objects in this MIB that may contain sensitive
information.

SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET the
objects in this MIB.

It is recommended that the implementors consider the security features
as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of the User-
based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-based Access
Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.

It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity
giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly configured to give
access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have
legitimate rights to GET them.
