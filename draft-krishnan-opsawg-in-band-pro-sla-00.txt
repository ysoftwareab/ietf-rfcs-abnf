        In-band Telemetry for a Proactive SLA Monitoring Framework

                 draft-krishnan-opsawg-in-band-pro-sla-00

Abstract

   The goal of in-band telemetry is to drive per packet, per hop real-
   time monitoring for the infrastructure towards achieving a
   programmable proactive SLA monitoring framework. Some of the key
   aspects from a switch/NIC perspective are - ingress/egress timestamp
   (latency), queue depth, bandwidth etc. Some of the key aspects from
   a server perspective are - cache/memory statistics etc. This
   document summarizes the current work in the industry in this area
   and identifies key requirements for a comprehensive solution.
   Towards addressing the requirements, this document describes uses
   cases and defines reusable monitoring packet formats across all
   layers in the OAM hierarchy.

Internet-Draft     In-band Telemetry - SLA Monitoring    September 2013


1. Introduction

   Proactive SLA monitoring is key for enabling DevOps in a converged
   infrastructure. As new services are continuously enabled using
   DevOps methodologies, it is critical to make sure that the users are
   delivered the promised SLAs through proactive SLA monitoring; in the
   case where SLAs are violated, the system should be able to
   automatically fix the issue or revert back to the old configuration
   as needed.

   Standards-based monitoring schemes [ietf-twamp] are coarse grained -
   first, based on injected packets and not on customer data packets
   and next, lack of per hop visibility while monitoring end-to-end and
   last, lack of coverage for network functions.

   New proposed monitoring schemes focus on switches/routers end-to-end
   in the DC - in-band network telemetry [p4-in-band] is to enable per
   packet, per hop monitoring for timestamp (latency), queue depth,
   bandwidth etc., Data-plane probe for in-band telemetry collection
   [ietf-in-band-dpp] is to enable the above per injected packet,
   [ietf-sfc-monitor] describes one-way latency monitoring for service
   chaining nodes using timestamps.

   Given the above landscape, the key requirements for a comprehensive
   proactive SLA monitoring framework are as follows

   .  Ability to monitor selective flows, e.g. monitor only low latency
     traffic

   .  Ability to mirror selective flows which are monitored, e.g.
     mirror only low latency traffic (mirroring all flows may not
     scale)

   .  Ability to strip monitoring information in the network edge
     since the application network stacks may not be able to process
     the additional monitoring information

   .  Ability to handle encrypted packets, e.g. enterprise cloud VPN
     across WAN, secure IaaS tunnels within a DC

   .  Ability to monitor individual network function paths, e.g. VNF
     service chaining where several VNFs/VMs are sharing the same
     physical server

   .  Ability to address each layer in the OAM hierarchy in a
     generic way using a common monitoring format. Within a DC,

     the various OAM layers could be Service Function, Overlay and
     Underlay.

   .  Ability to pre-construct the space for monitoring headers
     [telemetry-header-options] to guarantee deterministic performance
     especially for virtual network functions which are subject to a
     cache hierarchy in an industry standard server

   .  Ability to programmably select the hops being monitored
     to make sure the monitoring header size is bounded

   Towards addressing the key requirements, this document describes
   uses cases and packet formats for handling encrypted data packets
   (e.g. IPSEC for IaaS deployment) and service chaining and also
   describes options for maintaining deterministic application
   performance while performing elaborate monitoring.

2. In-band Telemetry for IPSEC tunnel packets

   The following describes in-band telemetry for IPSEC tunnels which is
   the most popular WAN tunneling protocol for secure communication.

   Use Cases:

   .  Cloud VPN: IPSEC tunnel between Enterprise branch and
     Enterprise/Cloud DC

        oPrimary use case for IPSEC is inter-domain, for example
          enterprise branch office to PoP could be one network domain

          (operator A) and PoP to Enterprise/Cloud DC could be another
          network domain (Operator B), e.g. Google Cloud Interconnect

        oValue proposition:

             . Real-time visibility/Service assurance for high priority
               tunnels carrying applications such as real-time
               voice/video

             . Minimal WAN switch/router buffer overprovisioning for
               all classes of traffic and maximizing WAN link
               utilization

   .  Intra-DC: IPSEC tunnel between overlay end points for a private
     multi-tenant environment in a converged infrastructure (vlan,
     VXLAN provide isolation but not privacy)

             . Real-time visibility/Service assurance for high priority
               tunnels carrying applications such as transactional
               storage, real-time big data

             . Minimal DC switch/router buffer overprovisioning for all
               classes of traffic

There are several possible packet formats for achieving the above use
cases. They are described below.

               [ietf-nsh] and [p4-in-band]

             . Option-Data - in-band telemetry data

   .  Encrypted or Authenticated payload

3. In-band Telemetry for Service Chaining

   Use cases:

   .  1) Monitoring of the networking interconnect. This would
     typically involve monitoring the overlay/underlay across the
     individual service chain nodes and the service chaining header
     ([ietf-nsh] etc.) across the entire service chain at the entry and
     exit points.



Krishnan                  Expires April 2014                   [Page 7]

Internet-Draft     In-band Telemetry - SLA Monitoring    September 2013

   .  2) Monitoring of the individual network functions comprising a
     service chain using the service chaining header ([ietf-nsh] etc.).
     The network functions could be virtual (VMs etc.) or physical.
     Typically, monitoring of the virtual network functions will bring
     additional value since they share resources such as caches, memory
     etc. in an industry standard server.

   .  Combination of above two use cases involving simultaneous
     monitoring of networking interconnect and individual network
     functions.

   Typical elements involved in service chain monitoring are
   vSwitches/NIC/ToR. For each individual network functions comprising
   a service chain, vSwitch/NIC/ToR will monitor ingress traffic to the
   network function for one or more of the INT [p4-in-band] parameters
   such as timestamp, queue depth, bandwidth and egress traffic to the
   vSwitch/NIC/ToR for one or more of the aforementioned INT parameters.
   Monitoring of the entire service chain at the entry point involves
   monitoring traffic sent to the first network function from
   vSwitch/NIC/ToR and exit point involves monitoring traffic from the
   last network function to the vSwitch/NIC/ToR for one of the
   aforementioned INT parameters. For highly accurate monitoring, it is
   recommended to use HW NIC/ToR vs a software based vSwitch. For
   example, HW implementations can measure timestamps to a nanosecond
   accuracy and can synchronize accurately with the master clock using
   protocols like IEEE 1588 PTP. A useful reference is [odl-nsh] which
   describes NSH service chaining operations from a ToR perspective.

   Typical elements involved in underlay monitoring are ToR,
   Aggregation and Core switches/routers.

   There are several possible packet formats for achieving the above
   the above use cases. Some are described here. More packet formats
   are work in progress.

3.1. NSH for service chaining Packet Format

   .  NSH Header

        oNext Protocol - 0x5 - INT

             . Needs to sync with next protocol in [ietf-nsh]

   .  NSH INT Header(s) (processed in vSwitch/NIC/ToR at each
     configured service chaining hop besides entry and exit points)

        oNext Protocol - 0x3 - Ethernet
