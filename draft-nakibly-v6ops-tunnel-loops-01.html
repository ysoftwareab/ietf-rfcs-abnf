<h1><br />Routing Loops using ISATAP
    and 6to4: Problem Statement and Proposed Solutions<br />draft-nakibly-v6ops-tunnel-loops-01.txt</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>This document is concerned with security vulnerabilities in the
      ISATAP and 6to4 tunnels. These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to take
      advantage of inconsistencies between a tunnel's overlay IPv6 routing
      state and the native IPv6 routing state. The attacks form routing loops
      which can be abused as a vehicle for traffic amplification to facilitate
      DoS attacks. We describe these security vulnerabilities and the attacks
      which exploit them. We further recommend on solutions to remove the
      vulnerabilities.

Introduction</h3>

<p>Recent research <a class='info' href='#USENIX09'>[USENIX09]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nakibly, G. and M. Arov, &ldquo;Routing Loop Attacks using IPv6 Tunnels,&rdquo; USENIX WOOT, August&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> has pointed out the
      existence of some security vulnerabilities in the design of the
      automatic tunnels ISATAP <a class='info' href='#RFC5214'>[RFC5214]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Templin, F., Gleeson, T., and D. Thaler, &ldquo;Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> and 6to4 <a class='info' href='#RFC3056'>[RFC3056]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Carpenter, B. and K. Moore, &ldquo;Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>. These vulnerabilities allow a specially crafted
      packet to loop back and forth between ISATAP routers or 6to4 relays
      thereby overloading them.
</p>
<p>In automatic tunnels a packet's egress node's IPv4 address is
      computationally derived from the destination IPv6 address of the packet.
      This feature eliminates the need to keep an explicit routing table at
      the tunnel's end points. In particular, the end points do not have to be
      updated as peers join and leave the tunnel. In fact, the end points of
      an automatic tunnel do not know which other end points are currently
      part of the tunnel. However, all end points operate on the implicit
      assumption that once a packet arrives at the tunnel, its destination
      indeed is part of the tunnel. This assumption poses a security
      vulnerability since it may result in an inconsistency between a tunnel's
      overlay IPv6 routing state and the native IPv6 routing state there by
      allowing a routing loop to be formed.
</p>
<p>An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a packet which
      is routed over a tunnel to a node that is not participating in that
      tunnel. This node may forward the packet out of the tunnel to a native
      IPv6 network. In that network, the packet is routed back to the ingress
      point that forwards it back into the tunnel. Consequently, the packet
      will loop in and out of the tunnel.
</p>
<p>A loop terminates only when the Hop Limit field in the IPv6 header of
      the packet is zeroed out. The maximum value that can be assigned to this
      field is 255. Note that when the packet is tunneled over IPv4 routers,
      the Hop Limit does not decrease. Every attack packet will traverse each
      hop along the loop 255/N times, where N is the number of IPv6 routers on
      the loop. As a result, the loops can be used as traffic amplification
      tools with a ratio of 255/N. The number of IPv6 routers on the loop is
      determined by the positions of the two victims. The closer the two
      victims are, the larger the amplification ratio will be.

<a name="rfc.section.2.1"></a><h3>2.1.&nbsp;
Attack #1: 6to4 Relay to ISATAP Router</h3>

<p>The two victims of this attack are a 6to4 relay and an ISATAP
        router. Let IPa and IPb denote the IPv4 address of the ISATAP router
        and the 6to4 relay, respectively. Let Prfa denote the IPv6 64-bit
        prefix of the ISATAP tunnel. The attack is depicted in Figure <a class='info' href='#figattack1'>Figure&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Attack #1: 6to4 Relay to ISATAP Router</span><span>)</span></a>. It is initiated by sending an IPv6 packet
        (packet 0 in Figure <a class='info' href='#figattack1'>Figure&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Attack #1: 6to4 Relay to ISATAP Router</span><span>)</span></a>) to a 6to4
        destination address with an embedded router address of IPa, i.e., the
        destination address begins with 2002:IPa::/48. The source address of
        the packet is an ISATAP address with Prfa as the prefix and IPb as the
        embedded IPv4 address. As the destination address is 6to4, the packet
        will be routed over the IPv6 network to the closest 6to4 relay. The
        relay receives the packet through its IPv6 interface and processes it
        as a normal IPv6 packet that needs to be delivered to the appropriate
        6to4 site. Hence, the packet is forwarded over the relay's IPv4
        interface with an IPv4 header having a destination address derived
        from the IPv6 destination, i.e., IPa. The source address is the
        address of the 6to4 relay, IPb. The packet (packet 1 in Figure <a class='info' href='#figattack1'>Figure&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Attack #1: 6to4 Relay to ISATAP Router</span><span>)</span></a>.) is routed over the IPv4 network to the ISATAP
        router. The router receives the packet on its IPv4 interface. It
        processes the packet as a regular IPv4 packet that originates from one
        of the end points of the ISATAP tunnel. Since the IPv4 source address
        corresponds to the IPv6 source address, the packet will be
        decapsulated. Since the packet's IPv6 destination is outside the
        ISATAP tunnel, the packet will be forwarded onto the native IPv6
        interface. The forwarded packet (packet 2 in Figure <a class='info' href='#figattack1'>Figure&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Attack #1: 6to4 Relay to ISATAP Router</span><span>)</span></a>.) is identical to the original attack packet.
        Hence, it will be routed back to the closest 6to4 relay, in which the
        loop will start again.

Attack #2: ISATAP Router to 6to4 Relay</h3>

<p>The two victims in this attack are again a 6to4 relay and an ISATAP
        router, but here they have swapped roles. This time the ISATAP router
        accepts the attack packet and forwards it on its ISATAP tunnel to the
        6to4 relay, which decapsulates it and forwards it back to the ISATAP
        router on the IPv6 network. Let IPa, IPa and Prfa be the same as
        above. The attack is depicted in Figure <a class='info' href='#figattack2'>Figure&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Attack #2: ISATAP Router to 6to4 Relay</span><span>)</span></a>.
        This attack is initiated by sending an IPv6 packet (packet 0 in Figure
        <a class='info' href='#figattack2'>Figure&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Attack #2: ISATAP Router to 6to4 Relay</span><span>)</span></a>) with a destination ISATAP address having
        Prfa as the prefix and IPb as the embedded IPv4 address. The source
        address of the packet is a 6to4 address with a router having the IPa
        address , i.e., the destination address begins with 2002:IPa::/48. The
        packet will be routed over the IPv6 network to the ISATAP router. The
        router receives the packet through its IPv6 interface and processes it
        as a normal IPv6 packet that needs to be delivered to the appropriate
        end point in the ISATAP tunnel. Hence, the packet is forwarded over
        the router's IPv4 interface with an IPv4 encapsulation having a
        destination address derived from the IPv6 destination , i.e., IPb. The
        source address is the address of the ISATAP router, IPa. The packet
        (packet 1 in Figure <a class='info' href='#figattack2'>Figure&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Attack #2: ISATAP Router to 6to4 Relay</span><span>)</span></a>) is routed over the
        IPv4 network to the 6to4 relay. The relay receives the packet on its
        IPv4 interface. It processes the packet as a normal IPv4 packet that
        originates from one of the end points of the 6to4 tunnel. Since the
        IPv4 source address corresponds to the IPv6 source address, the packet
        will be admitted and decapsulated. Since the packet's IPv6 destination
        is outside the 6to4 tunnel, the packet will be forwarded out on the
        native IPv6 interface. The forwarded packet (packet 2 in Figure <a class='info' href='#figattack2'>Figure&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Attack #2: ISATAP Router to 6to4 Relay</span><span>)</span></a>) is identical to the original attack packet.
        Hence, it will be routed back to the ISATAP router, in which the loop
        will start again.

Attack #3: ISATAP Router to ISATAP Router</h3>

<p>The two victims in this attack are two ISATAP routers -- router A
        and router B -- having addresses IPa and IPb, respectively. Let Prfa
        and Prfb be the prefixes of the ISATAP tunnels of router A and router
        B, respectively. Note that the two routers do not participate in the
        same ISATAP tunnel. However, they may reside at the same or different
        sites. The attack is depicted in Figure <a class='info' href='#figattack3'>Figure&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Attack #3: ISATAP Router to ISATAP Router</span><span>)</span></a>.
        It is initiated by sending an IPv6 packet (packet 0 in Figure <a class='info' href='#figattack3'>Figure&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Attack #3: ISATAP Router to ISATAP Router</span><span>)</span></a>) with a destination ISATAP address having Prfa
        as the prefix and IPb as the embedded IPv4 address. The source address
        of the packet is an ISATAP address having Prfb as the prefix and IPa
        as the embedded IPv4 address. The packet will be routed over the IPv6
        network to router A. The router receives the packet through its IPv6
        interface and processes it as a normal IPv6 packet that needs to be
        delivered to the appropriate end point of its ISATAP tunnel. The fact
        that the source address is also an ISATAP address does not matter
        here; the important thing is that the packet originated outside of the
        tunnel A. Hence, the packet is forwarded over the router's IPv4
        interface with an IPv4 encapsulation having a destination address
        derived from the IPv6 destination , i.e., IPb. The source address is
        the address of the router A, IPa. The packet (marked with 1 in Figure
        <a class='info' href='#figattack3'>Figure&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Attack #3: ISATAP Router to ISATAP Router</span><span>)</span></a>) is routed over the IPv4 network to
        router B. The router receives the packet on its IPv4 interface. It
        processes the packet as a regular IPv4 packet that originates from one
        of the end points of its tunnel. Since the IPv4 source address
        corresponds to the IPv6 source address, the packet will be
        decapsulated. The packet's IPv6 destination is outside of router B's
        tunnel; hence the packet is forwarded out onto the IPv6 interface. The
        forwarded packet (packet 2 in Figure <a class='info' href='#figattack3'>Figure&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Attack #3: ISATAP Router to ISATAP Router</span><span>)</span></a>) is
        identical to the original attack packet. Hence, it will be routed back
        to router A, in which the loop will start again.
</p>
<p>The attack can also be launched on two ISATAP routers having
        private IPv4 addresses in th same IPv4 routing region.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1"></a><h3>3.1.&nbsp;
Destination and Source Address Check</h3>

<p>Tunnel routers can use a source address check mitigation when they
        forward an IPv6 packet into a tunnel interface with an IPv6 source
        address that embeds one of the router's configured IPv4 addresses.
        Similarly, tunnel routers can use a destination address check
        mitigation when they receive an IPv6 packet on a tunnel interface with
        an IPv6 destination address that embeds one of the router's configured
        IPv4 addresses. These checks should correspond to both tunnels' IPv6
        address formats, regardless of the type of tunnel the router
        employs.
</p>
<p>For example, if tunnel router A (ISATAP router or 6to4 relay)
        forwards a packet into a tunnel interface with an IPv6 source address
        that matches the 6to4 prefix 2002:IPa::/48, the router discards the
        packet if IPa is one of its own IPv4 addresses. In a second example,
        if tunnel router B (ISATAP router or 6to4 relay) receives an IPv6
        packet on a tunnel interface with an IPv6 destination address that
        matches the ISATAP address suffix ::0200:5EFE:IPb, the router discards
        the packet if IPb is one of its own IPv4 addresses. In both of these
        examples, the router can unambiguously check the addresses IPa and IPb
        since both are known to be public IPv4 addresses by definition of the
        6to4 and ISATAP address formats. However, the router cannot perform
        the simple check if the embedded IPv4 address is a private one <a class='info' href='#RFC1918'>[RFC1918]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rekhter, Y., Moskowitz, R., Karrenberg, D., Groot, G., and E. Lear, &ldquo;Address Allocation for Private Internets,&rdquo; February&nbsp;1996.</span><span>)</span></a> since it is ambiguous in scope. This reservation
        is relevant only to attacks of type #3 (a loop between two ISATAP
        routers) since the other two types of attack involves a 6to4 tunnel
        which always embeds public IPv4 addresses.
</p>
<p>When a tunnel router (ISATAP, 6to4) has a way of knowing whether an
        embedded IPv4 address is one of its own addresses, it can avoid the
        routing loop attack scenarios depicted in Figures 1, 2 and 3 by
        performing the following simple checks:
</p>
<p>
          </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>When the router forwards an IPv6 packet into a tunnel
            interface, it discards the packet if the IPv6 source address is
            not one of the router's configured IPv6 addresses but embeds one
            of the router's configured IPv4 addresses.
</li>
<li>When the router receives an IPv6 packet on a tunnel interface,
            it discards the packet if the IPv6 destination address is not one
            of the router's configured IPv6 addresses but embeds one of the
            router's configured IPv4 addresses.
</li>
</ul><p>
        
</p>
<p>This approach can be employed by an ISATAP router or 6to4 relay. As
        noted above the router must perform the embedded IPv4 address
        inspections for both ISATAP and 6to4 IPv6 address formats even if the
        router does not implement one of those tunnels. This approach has the
        advantage that it is easy to implement and that no ancillary state is
        required, since checking is through static lookup in the lists of IPv4
        and IPv6 addresses belonging to the router.
</p>
<p>As noted above, this simple approach alone cannot be used when the
        embedded IPv4 address in the ISATAP address is private, because the
        address may be legitimately allocated to another node in another
        routing region. To apply this check the router must first
        unambiguously determine the scope of the address. The following check
        serves this purpose.

Known IPv6 Prefix Check</h3>

<p>The known IPv6 prefix check is tied to the conceptual ISATAP link
          model. It observes that an ISATAP link spans a portion of a
          connected IPv4 routing region up to (but not beyond) the entire
          connected IPv4 routing region itself. For example, if there were no
          physical or logical segmentations (e.g., enterprise network border
          gateways) the entire public IPv4 Internet would be spanned by a
          single ISATAP link. Similarly, a private IPv4 address routing region
          can be spanned by one or more ISATAP links that are distinct from
          the links that span other private IPv4 routing regions.
</p>
<p>Each IPv4 routing region can be segmented through logical or
          physical segmentation, e.g., through ip-proto-41 filters, firewalls,
          etc. In that case, each distinct segment is spanned by a distinct
          ISATAP link. As for any links, multiple distinct ISATAP links can be
          joined together by bridges or IPv6 routers.
</p>
<p>Each ISATAP link configures a set of IPv6 subnet prefixes, where
          each subnet prefix spans either the entire link or only a portion of
          the link. Therefore, if the router can determine the full list of
          IPv6 subnet prefixes assigned to ISATAP interfaces attached to the
          link, it can use the list to determine when static destination and
          source address checks are necessary. By keeping track of the list of
          IPv6 prefixes assigned to ISATAP interfaces connected to the link,
          an ISATAP router can perform the following checks on an ISATAP
          address which embeds a private IPv4 address:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>When the ISATAP router forwards an IPv6 packet into an ISATAP
              interface with a source address that matches an IPv6 prefix in
              the on-link prefix list, it determines whether the packet should
              be discarded or forwarded by performing the source address check
              specified in <a class='info' href='#address-check'>Section&nbsp;3.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Destination and Source Address Check</span><span>)</span></a>. Otherwise, the
              router forwards the packet.
</li>
<li>When the ISATAP router receives an IPv6 packet on an ISATAP
              interface with a destination address that matches an IPv6 prefix
              in the on-link prefix list, it determines whether the packet
              should be discarded or accepted by performing the destination
              address check specified in <a class='info' href='#address-check'>Section&nbsp;3.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Destination and Source Address Check</span><span>)</span></a>.
              Otherwise, the router accepts the packet.
</li>
</ul><p>The disadvantage of this approach is the administrative
          overhead for maintaining the list of IPv6 subnet prefixes associated
          with an ISATAP link may become unwieldy should that list be long
          and/or frequently updated.

Neighbor Cache Check</h3>

<p>The neighbor cache check mitigation observes that the routing loop
        attack scenarios depicted in Figures 1, 2 and 3 specifically target
        the ISATAP IPv6 on-link subnet model. In this approach, hosts
        configure IPv6 addresses and assign IPv6 subnet prefixes on an ISATAP
        interface based on the Prefix Information Options included in the
        unicast Router Advertisement (RA) messages they receive from routers.
        Moreover, ISATAP hosts must first send Router Solicitation (RS)
        messages to routers in order to elicit these RAs since the ISATAP link
        model is Non-Broadcast, Multiple Access (NBMA). Therefore, ISATAP
        routers can keep track of the hosts from which they have recently
        received RS messages by maintaining entries in their ISATAP interface
        neighbor cache that are keyed on the IPv6 unicast link-local source
        addresses received in the RS messages. The ISATAP router can then
        determine which hosts are willing participants in the ISATAP IPv6
        on-link subnets.
</p>
<p>By keeping track of the hosts that have recently sent RS messages,
        an ISATAP router can perform the following simple checks:
</p>
<p>
          </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>When the ISATAP router forwards a packet into an ISATAP
            interface with an IPv6 destination address that matches a
            non-link-local prefix assigned to the interface and that embeds
            the IPv4 address IPa, it discards the packet if there is no
            corresponding neighbor cache entry for the interface keyed on an
            IPv6 unicast link-local address that embeds the IPv4 address
            IPa.
</li>
<li>When the ISATAP router receives a packet on an ISATAP interface
            with an IPv6 source address that matches a non-link-local prefix
            assigned to the interface and embeds the IPv4 address IPb, it
            discards the packet if there is no corresponding neighbor cache
            entry for the interface keyed on an IPv6 unicast link-local
            address that embeds the IPv4 address IPb.
</li>
</ul><p>
        
</p>
<p>This approach can only be employed by an ISATAP router. It has the
        advantage that the ISATAP router discards only those IPv6 packets that
        could cause the looping conditions, i.e., those packets with source
        and/or destination addresses taken from an ISATAP IPv6 on-link subnet
        prefix but for which no corresponding neighbor cache entry exists. In
        contrast, other approaches could in some cases discard IPv6 packets
        that pertain to legitimate communications. The approach is also easy
        to implement, and naturally leverages the relationship between the
        router's advertised prefix lifetimes and the interval between the
        host's successive RS transmissions according to the specifications in
        <a class='info' href='#RFC5214'>[RFC5214]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Templin, F., Gleeson, T., and D. Thaler, &ldquo;Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>This approach requires the ISATAP router to maintain a neighbor
        cache with entries created or updated by the reception of ISATAP host
        RS messages. These entries must be retained for a duration that is at
        least as long as the router's advertised prefix lifetimes, i.e., even
        if the entries transition into the STALE state. This may require an
        implementation to adjust its garbage-collection interval for stale
        neighbor cache entries. The approach further requires that hosts
        perform the RS/RA exchanges specified in Section 8.3.4 of <a class='info' href='#RFC5214'>[RFC5214]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Templin, F., Gleeson, T., and D. Thaler, &ldquo;Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>, i.e., the host-initiated RS/RA exchanges must be
        performed. Finally, this approach assumes that the neighbor cache will
        remain coherent and not subject to malicious attack, which must be
        confirmed based on specific deployment scenarios. One possible way for
        an attacker to subvert the neighbor cache is to send false RS messages
        with a spoofed source address.

Known IPv4 Address Check</h3>

<p>The known IPv4 address check method observes that each on-link IPv6
        subnet prefix on an ISATAP interface is configured over a limited set
        of IPv4 addresses, since each ISATAP Potential Router List will be
        used only by a finite set of hosts. Therefore, only those hosts
        configured from a subset of the IPv4 addresses in an IPv4 routing
        region are authorized to configure IPv6 addresses and subnet prefixes
        advertised by a given ISATAP router. By keeping track of the set of
        IPv4 addresses that are authorized to use an ISATAP on-link IPv6
        subnet, an ISATAP router can perform the following simple checks:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>When the ISATAP router forwards an IPv6 packet into an ISATAP
            interface with a destination address that matches a non-link-local
            prefix assigned to the interface and that embeds the IPv4 address
            IPa, it discards the packet if IPa does not belong to the list of
            IPv4 addresses over which the ISATAP on-link IPv6 subnet is
            configured.
</li>
<li>When the ISATAP router receives an IPv6 packet on an ISATAP
            interface with a source address that matches a non-link-local
            prefix assigned to the interface and that embeds the IPv4 address
            IPb, it discards the packet if IPb does not belong to the list of
            IPv4 addresses over which the ISATAP on-link IPv6 subnet is
            configured.
</li>
</ul><p>This approach can only be employed by an ISATAP router, and
        offers a close analogy to the neighbor cache check discussed in
        Section 3.2. Indeed, one possible interpretation of this approach is
        that the router should simply cache the IPv4 addresses of hosts that
        have sent it an RS message. In this interpretation, the only
        difference between this approach and the neighbor cache check
        discussed in Section 3.2 is the nature of the internal data structure
        used to store the IPv4 addresses, which is likely to be an
        implementation detail. Therefore, the same set of advantages and
        disadvantages as described in Section 3.2 apply.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, the ISATAP router could pre-configure a static list
        of known IPv4 host addresses. This list would be discovered through
        some unspecified means (e.g., manual configuration), and would serve
        as a "Potential Host List (PHL)" for the ISATAP interface.
