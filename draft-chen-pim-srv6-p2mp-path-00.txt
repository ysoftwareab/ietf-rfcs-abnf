1.  Introduction

   The Segment Routing (SR) for unicast or Point-to-Point (P2P) path is
   described in [RFC8402].  For SR multicast or Point-to-Multipoint
   (P2MP) path/tree, it may be implemented through using multiple SR P2P
   paths.  The function of a SR P2MP path/tree from an ingress node to
   multiple (say n) egress/leaf nodes is implemented by n SR P2P paths.
   These n P2P paths are from the ingress to those n egress/leaf nodes
   of the P2MP path/tree.  This solution may waste some network
   resources such as link bandwidth.

Internet-Draft               SRv6 P2MP Path                    July 2020


   An alternative solution proposed in
   [I-D.shen-spring-p2mp-transport-chain] uses a number of P2MP chain
   tunnels to implement a P2MP path/tree from an ingress to n egress/
   leaf nodes.  Each P2MP chain tunnel is a tunnel from the ingress to a
   leaf node as its tail end and may have some leaf nodes as its bud
   nodes along the tunnel.  This alternative solution improves the usage
   of network resources over the solution above using pure P2P paths.
   However, these two solutions are based on SR P2P paths.

   A solution for a SR P2MP path/tree using a P2MP multicast tree is
   proposed in [I-D.voyer-pim-sr-p2mp-policy].  For a SR P2MP path/tree
   from an ingress/root to multiple egress/leaf nodes, a multicast P2MP
   tree is created to deliver the traffic from the ingress/root to the
   egress/leaf nodes.  The state of the tree is instantiated in the
   forwarding plane by a controller such as PCE at Root node,
   intermediate Replication nodes and Leaf nodes of the tree.  This is
   not consistent with the SR principles in which no state is stored at
   the core of the network.

   This document describes a new solution for a SRv6 Point-to-Multipoint
   (P2MP) Path/Tree to deliver the traffic from the ingress of the path
   to the multiple egresses/leaves of the path in a SR domain.  This
   solution uses a P2MP multicast tree without storing its state in the
   core of the network for a SR P2MP path/tree like a SR P2P path.

2.  Overview of P2MP Multicast Tree

   For a SR P2P path from its ingress to its egress, a segment list for
   the path is provided to the ingress.  The ingress pushes the list
   into a packet, and the packet is delivered to the egress according to
   the segment list without any state in the core of the network.

   For a SR P2MP path from its ingress to multiple egress/leaf nodes, a
   segment list for the P2MP path is provided to the ingress.  The
   ingress pushes the list into a packet, and the packet is delivered to
   the multiple egress/leaf nodes according to the segment list without
   any state in the core of the network.

   Figure 1 shows a SR P2MP path from ingress/root R to four egress/leaf
   nodes L1, L2, L3 and L4.  Nodes P1, P2, P3 and P4 are the transit
   nodes of the P2MP path.

   Suppose that X-m is the segment identifier (SID) of node X.  X-m is
   an adjacent SID or node SID.  For simplicity, we assume X-m is a node
   SID in the illustrations below.  R-m, P1-m, P2-m, P3-m, P4-m, L1-m,
   L2-m, L3-m and L4-m are the SIDs of the nodes on the SR P2MP path.
   They are multicast SIDs or replication SIDs in general.

   A multicast SID is a SID from a multicast SID block.  In a SR domain
   supporting SR multicast, each node has a multicast node SID, which is
   globally significant; each adjacency of a node has a multicast
   adjacency SID, which is locally significant.  A multicast SID of a
   node on a SR P2MP path is associated with the SIDs of the next hop
   (or say downstream) nodes.  When the node receives a packet with its
   multicast SID, it duplicates and sends the packet to each of the next
   hop nodes according to their SIDs.

   If node P on a SR P2MP path has B (B > 1) next hop nodes along the
   path, the SID of node P, P-m, MUST be a multicast SID when it is in
   the segment list for the P2MP path.  The SIDs of the B next hop nodes
   just follow P-m in the segment list.  When node P receives the packet
   with P-m, it duplicates and sends the packet to each of the B next
   hop nodes along the P2MP path.

            Figure 1: SR P2MP Path from R to L1, L2, L3 and L4

   {P1-m, P2-m, P3-m, L1-m, L2-m, P4-m, L3-m, L4-m} is a segment list
   for the SR P2MP path in Figure 1 to be pushed into a packet at
   ingress/root R.  Node P1 has 2 next hop nodes P2 and P3 along the
   P2MP path.  The next hop nodes' SIDs P2-m and P3-m follow P1-m, which
   is P1's multicast SID.  When P1 receives a packet transported by the
   P2MP path, it duplicates and sends the packet to the next hop nodes
   P2 and P3 according to P1-m, P2-m and P3-m.

   The number of branches or next hops from node P1 is a value of one
   argument in P1-m, called No-Branches.  The value of No-Branches in
   P1-m is 2.  With this information, node P1 duplicates and sends the
   packet to 2 next hop nodes P2 and P3, which are indicated by the 2
   SIDs P2-m and P3-m following P1-m.

Internet-Draft               SRv6 P2MP Path                    July 2020


   The number of SIDs of the nodes under node P1 is a value of another
   argument in P1-m, called No-SIDs.  The value of No-SIDs in P1-m is 7,
   indicating that there are 7 SIDs following P1-m in the segment list.

   There are 2 branches or next hops (i.e., L1 and L2) from node P2 and
   2 SIDs (i.e., L1-m and L2-m) of the nodes under node P2.  The values
   of No-Branches and No-SIDs in P2-m are 2 and 2.  with this
   information, before sending the packet to node P2, node P1 pushes the
   SIDs under node P2 into the packet (i.e., the packet has a new
   segment list with the SIDs under node P2.  The new segment list
   replaces the old one in the packet).

   There are 1 branch or next hop (i.e., P4) from node P3 and 3 SIDs
   (i.e., P4-m, L3-m and L4-m) of the nodes under node P3.  The values
   of No-Branches and No-SIDs in P3-m are 1 and 3 respectively.  with
   this information, before sending the packet to node P3, node P1
   pushes the SIDs under node P3 into the packet.

   Each node on the SR P2MP path sends the packet to its next hop nodes
   according to the segment list and no state is stored in any transit
   node (i.e., the core of the network).  The packet is delivered to the
   egress/leaf nodes from the ingress.

3.  Encoding P2MP Multicast Tree

   For each sub-tree STi of a SR P2MP path from the ingress node of the
   P2MP path, suppose that

   o  the multicast SID of the next hop node NHi is mSIDi;

   o  there are Bi branches (i.e., outgoing interfaces) to the next hop
      node BNHj (j = 1, ..., Bi) from node NHi along the sub-tree, the
      multicast SID of BNHj is mSIDij;

   o  the number of branches (i.e., outgoing interfaces) under the node
      BNHj (j = 1, ..., Bi) is BBj; and the number of SIDs of the nodes
      under each of the Bi branches from node BNHj is NSj (j = 1, ...,
      Bi).

   Sub-tree STi is encoded as segment list {mSIDi, mSIDi1, ..., mSIDiBi,
   SegSeq1, ..., SegSeqBi}, where mSIDi contains the number of branches,
   Bi, in its No-Branches field, and the number of SIDs under mSIDi in
   its No-SIDs field; mSIDij (j = 1, ..., Bi) contains the number of
   branches, BBj, in its No-Branches field and the number of SIDs, NSj,
   in its No-SIDs field; SegSeqj (j = 1, ..., Bi) is the SID sequence in
   the segment list encoding the sub-trees from node BNHj.

   For the P2MP path in Figure 1 from ingress node R to egress nodes L1,
   L2, L3 and L4, there is one sub-tree from R.

   For this sub-tree,

   o  the next hop node is P1 and the multicast SID of P1 is P1-m;

   o  there are two branches to the next hop nodes P2 and P3 from node
      P1 along the sub-tree; the number of SIDs of the nodes under P1 is
      7; the multicast SIDs of P2 and P3 are P2-m and P3-m respectively;

   o  the numbers of SIDs of the nodes under these two branches are 2
      and 3 respectively.  The SIDs of the nodes under P2 are L1-m and
      L2-m.  The SIDs of the nodes under P3 are P4-m, L3-m and L4-m.

   The sub-tree is encoded as segment list {P1-m, P2-m, P3-m, L1-m,
   L2-m, P4-m, L3-m, L4-m}, where P1-m's No-Branches field is set to 2
   and its No-SIDs field to 7; P2-m's No-Branches field is set to 2 and
   P3-m's No-Branches field is set to 1; P2-m's No-SIDs field is set to
   2 and P3-m's No-SIDs field is set to 3; L1-m and L2-m are the SID
   sequence in the segment list encoding the sub-trees from P2; P4-m,
   L3-m and L4-m are the SID sequence in the segment list encoding the
   sub-trees from P3.  P4-m's No-Branches field is set to 2 and No-SIDs
   field is set to 2.

   Figure 2 shows in details the segment list, which is an encoding of
   the P2MP multicast tree for the SR P2MP path from R to L1, L2, L3 and
   L4.

4.  Procedures/Behaviors

   This section describes the procedures or behaviors on the ingress,
   transit and egress/leaf node of a SR P2MP path to deliver a packet
   received from the path to its destinations.

4.1.  Procedure/Behavior on Ingress Node

   For a packet to be transported by a SR P2MP Path, the ingress of the
   P2MP path duplicates the packet for each sub-tree of the SR P2MP path
   branching from the ingress, pushes the segment list encoding the sub-
   tree into the packet and sends the packet to the next hop node along
   the sub-tree.

   For example, there is one sub-tree from the ingress R of the SR P2MP
   path in Figure 1 via next hop node P1 towards egress/leaf nodes L1,
   L2, L3 and L4.

   For this sub-tree, the ingress R duplicates the packet, set the
   destination address (DA) to P1-m (i.e., multicast SID of node P1),

Internet-Draft               SRv6 P2MP Path                    July 2020


   pushes the segment list without P1-m (i.e., {P2-m, P3-m, L1-m, L2-m,
   P4-m, L3-m, L4-m}) encoding the sub-tree in SRH of the packet and
   sends the packet to DA (i.e., node P1).  The contents of the
   multicast SIDs P1-m, P2-m, P3-m, L1-m, L2-m, P4-m, L3-m, L4-m are
   shown in Figure 2.

4.2.  Procedure/Behavior on Transit Node

   When a transit node of a SR P2MP path receives a packet transported
   by the P2MP path, the DA of the packet is a multicast SID of the node
   and the packet contains a segment list for the sub-trees under the
   transit node.  The DA and the segment list comprise the information
   for encoding the sub-trees.

   For example, when node P1 receives a packet transported by the SR
   P2MP path in Figure 1, the packet's DA is P1-m (which is a multicast
   SID of node P1) and the segment list in the packet is {P2-m, P3-m,
   L1-m, L2-m, P4-m, L3-m, L4-m}.

   The No-Branches field (which has value of n) of the DA indicates that
   there are n branches (or say sub-trees) under the transit node.  The
   No-SIDs field of the DA indicates the number of SIDs for these n sub-
   trees under the transit node.  The multicast SIDs of the next hop
   nodes of these n sub-trees are the first n multicast SIDs of the
   segment list in the packet.

   For example, the No-Branches field (which has value of 2) of DA =
   P1-m indicates that there are 2 branches (or say sub-trees) under
   node P1.  The No-SIDs field (which has value of 7) of the DA = P1-m
   indicates that there are 7 SIDs for these 2 sub-trees under node P1.

   The first multicast SID (P2-m) of the segment list is the SID of the
   next hop node (P2) of the first sub-tree; The second multicast SID
   (P3-m) of the segment list is the SID of the next hop node (P3) of
   the second sub-tree.

   After the multicast SIDs of the next hop nodes, there are n blocks of
   SIDs for those n sub-trees.  The No-SIDs field (which has value of
   B1) of the first multicast SID of the next hop nodes indicates that
   there are B1 SIDs in the first block for the first sub-tree; the No-
   SIDs field (which has value of B2) of the second multicast SID of the
   next hop nodes indicates that there are B2 SIDs in the second block
   for the second sub-tree after the first block; and so on.

   For example, there are 2 blocks of SIDs for the 2 sub-trees under

   next hop nodes) has value of 2, indicating that there are 2 SIDs in
   the first block for the first sub-tree, which are L1-m and L2-m.

   The No-SIDs field of P3-m (the second multicast SID of the next hop
   nodes) has value of 3, indicating that there are 3 SIDs in the second
   block for the second sub-tree after the first block, which are P4-m,
   L3-m and L4-m.

   The transit node duplicates the packet without top header for each
   sub-tree under it and adds a new header with a new segment list built
   from the SID block for the sub-tree to the duplicated packet.  It
   sets the DA of the packet to the multicast SID of the next hop node
   along the sub-tree and sends the packet to the DA.

   For example, node P1 duplicates the packet for the first sub-tree
   towards L1 and L2 and adds a new header with a new segment list
   {L1-m, L2-m}.  It sets DA = P2-m (multicast SID of next hop P2), and
   sends the packet to the DA (i.e., P2).

   Node P1 duplicates the packet for the second sub-tree via P3 towards
   L3 and L4 and adds a new header with a new segment list {P4-m, L3-m,
   L4-m}.  It sets DA = P3-m (multicast SID of next hop P3), and sends
   the packet to the DA (i.e., P3).

4.3.  Procedure/Behavior on Egress Node

   When an egress node of a SR P2MP path receives a packet transported
   by the P2MP path, the DA of the packet is a SID of the egress node.
   The egress node sends the packet to its destination accordingly.  If
   the SID is a multicast SID of the egress, the No-Branches field and
   No-SIDs field are all zeros.

5.  Protection

   Protections for a SR P2MP path can be classified into two types:
   global protection and local protection.

5.1.  Global Protection

   For a primary SR P2MP path from an ingress node R1 to multiple egress
   nodes Li (i = 1, ..., n), a backup SR P2MP path from an ingress node
   R1' to multiple egress nodes Li' (i = 1, ..., n) is set up to provide
   global protection for the primary SR P2MP path.  If R1' is the same
   as R1, the failure of the ingress node R1 of the primary SR P2MP path
   is not protected; otherwise (i.e., R1' and R1 are different and
   connected to the same traffic source), the failure of the ingress
   node R1 is protected.  If Li' is the same as Li (i = 1, ..., n), the
   failure of the egress nodes Li (i = 1, ..., n) of the primary SR P2MP

   path is not protected; otherwise (i.e., Li' and Li are different and
   connected to the same destination), the failure of the egress nodes
   Li is protected.

   When a failure happens on the primary SR P2MP path and is detected by
   the source of the traffic or other entity, the traffic to be
   transported by the primary SR P2MP path is switched to the backup SR
   P2MP path, which sends the traffic from its ingress node R1' to its
   egress nodes Li' (i = 1, ..., n).

5.2.  Local Protection

   Local protection or say Fast Reroute (FRR) of a node and adjacency
   segment on a SR P2P path is proposed in
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-segment-routing-ti-lfa] and
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-srv6-egress-protection].  It can be applied to FRR of
   a node and adjacency segment on a SR P2MP path in a similar way.  But
   FRR for SR P2MP path is more complicated.

   More details will be added later.
