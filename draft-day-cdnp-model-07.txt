Abstract

   Content internetworking (CDI) is the technology for interconnecting
   content networks, previously called "content peering," "CDN
   peering," or "content distribution internetworking." A common
   vocabulary helps the process of discussing such interconnection and
   interoperation.  This document introduces content networks and
   content internetworking, and defines elements for such a common
   vocabulary.

1. Introduction

   Content networks are of increasing importance to the overall
   architecture of the Web.  This document presents a vocabulary for
   use in developing technology for interconnecting content networks,
   or "content internetworking."

   The accepted name for the technology of interconnecting content
   networks is "content internetworking." For historical reasons, we
   abbreviate this term using the acronym CDI (from "content
   distribution internetworking").  Earlier names relied on analogy
   with peering and interconnection of IP networks; thus we had
   "content peering" and "CDN peering".  All of these other names are
   now deprecated, and we have worked to establish consistent usage of
   "content internetworking" and "CDI" throughout the drafts of the
   IETF CDI group.

   The terminology in this document builds from the previous taxonomy
   of web caching and replication in RFC 3040[3] . In particular, we
   have attempted to avoid the use of the common terms "proxies" or
   "caches" in favor of the better-defined terms "caching proxy,"
   "reverse caching proxy," and "server accelerator."

   Section 2 provides background on content networks.  Section 3
   introduces the terms used for elements of a content network and
   explains how those terms are used. Section 5 deals with content
   internetworking, introducing the terms and explaining how those
   terms are used. The remainder of the document notes various
   operational and security considerations that are relevant to content
   internetworking.

   The IETF CDI effort has produced a number of other documents related
   to content internetworking. Other documents providing general
   information about CDI are: "Content Internetworking Scenarios" [4],
   which enumerates scenarios for content-internetworking-related
   interactions; "Content Internetworking Architectural Overview" [6],
   which gives an overall architecture of the elements for CDI; and
   "Known CDN Request-Routing Mechanisms" [7], which summarizes known
   mechanisms for request-routing. In addition, there are documents
   describing the requirements for various aspects of CDI:
   "Request-Routing Requirements for Content Internetworking" [8],
   "Distribution Requirements for Content Internetworking" [9], and
   "Content Internetworking (CDI) Authentication, Authorization, and
   Accounting Requirements" [5]

2. Content Networks

   The past several years have seen the evolution of technologies
   centered around "content." Protocols, appliances, and entire markets
   have been created exclusively for the location, download, and usage
   tracking of content. Some sample technologies in this area have
   included web caching proxies, content management tools, intelligent
   "web switches", and advanced log analysis tools.

   When used together, these tools form new types of networks, dubbed
   "content networks". Whereas network infrastructures previously have
   traditionally processed information at layers 1 through 3 of the OSI
   stack, content networks include network infrastructure that exists
   in layers 4 through 7. Whereas lower-layer network infrastructures
   centered on the routing, forwarding, and switching of frames and
   packets, content networks deal with the routing and forwarding of
   requests and responses for content. The units of transported data in
   content networks, such as images, movies, or songs, are often very
   large and may span hundreds or thousands of packets.

   Alternately, content networks can be seen as a new virtual overlay
   to the OSI stack: a "content layer", to enable richer services that
   rely on underlying elements from all 7 layers of the stack. Whereas
   traditional applications, such as file transfer (FTP), relied on
   underlying protocols such as TCP/IP for transport, overlay services
   in content networks rely on layer 7 protocols such as HTTP or RTSP
   for transport.

   The proliferation of content networks and content networking
   capabilities gives rise to interest in interconnecting content
   networks and finding ways for distinct content networks to cooperate
   for better overall service.

2.1 Problem Description

   Content networks typically play some role in solving the "content
   distribution problem". Abstractly, the goal in solving this problem
   is to arrange a rendezvous between a content source at an origin
   server and a content sink at a viewer's user agent. In the trivial
   case, the rendezvous mechanism is that every user agent sends every
   request directly to the origin server named in the host part of the
   URL identifying the content.

   As the audience for the content source grows, so do the demands on
   the origin server. There are a variety of ways in which the trivial
   system can be modified for better performance.  The apparent single
   logical server may in fact be implemented as a large "farm" of
   server machines behind a switch. Both caching proxies and reverse
   caching proxies can be deployed between the client and server, so

Internet-Draft                 CDI Model                    October 2001


   that requests can be satisfied by some cache instead of by the
   server.

   For the sake of background, several sample content networks are
   described in the following sections that each attempt to address
   this problem.

2.2 Caching Proxies

   A type of content network that has been in use for several years is
   a caching proxy deployment. Such a network might typically be
   employed by an ISP for the benefit of users accessing the Internet,
   such as through dial or cable modem.

   In the interest of improving performance and reducing bandwidth
   utilization, caching proxies are deployed close to the users. These
   users are encouraged to send their web requests through the caches
   rather than directly to origin servers, such as by configuring their
   browsers to do so. When this configuration is properly done, the
   user's entire browsing session goes through a specific caching
   proxy. That caching proxy will therefore contain the "hot set" of
   all Internet content being viewed by all of the users of that
   caching proxy.

   When a request is being handled at a caching proxy on behalf of a
   user, other decisions may be made, such as:

   o  A provider that deploys caches in many geographically diverse
      locations may also deploy regional parent caches to further
      aggregate user requests and responses. This may provide
      additional performance improvement and bandwidth savings. When
      parents are included, this is known as hierarchical caching.

   o  Using rich parenting protocols, redundant parents may be deployed
      such that a failure in a primary parent is detected and a backup
      is used instead.

   o  Using similar parenting protocols, requests may be partitioned
      such that requests for certain content domains are sent to a
      specific primary parent. This can help to maximize the efficient
      use of caching proxy resources.

   The following diagram depicts a hierarchical cache deployment as
   described above:

                                   --------

   RFC 3040[3] contains additional examples of how multiple caching
   proxies may be used.

2.3 Server Farms

   Another type of content network that has been in widespread use for
   several years is a server farm. A typical server farm makes use of a
   so-called "intelligent" or "content" switch (i.e. one that uses
   information in OSI layers 4-7). The switch examines content requests
   and dispatches them among a (potentially large) group of servers.

   Some of the goals of a a server farm include:

   o  Creating the impression that the group of servers is actually a
      single origin site.

   o  Load-balancing of requests across all servers in the group.

   o  Automatic routing of requests away from servers that fail.

   o  Routing all requests for a particular user agent's session to the
      same server, in order to preserve session state.

   The following diagram depicts a simple server farm deployment:

                        client A   \      /    client B
                                    \    /
                                 -------------
                                 |  L4-L7    |
                                 |  switch   |
                                 -------------
                                    ^     ^
                                   /       \
                                  /         \
                                 /           \
                         request from     request from
                           client A         client B

   A similar type of content network may be constructed by replacing
   the switch with a server accelerator [3] .

2.4 Content Distribution Networks

   Both hierarchical caching and server farms are useful techniques,
   but have limits. Server farms and server accelerators can improve
   the scalability of the origin server. However, since the multiple
   servers and server accelerators are typically deployed near the
   origin server, they do little to improve performance problems that
   are due to network congestion. Caching proxies can improve
   performance problems due to network congestion (since they are
   situated near the clients) but they cache objects based on client
   demand -- so they may not help the distribution load of a given
   origin server.

   Thus, a content provider with a popular content source can find that
   it has to invest in large server farms, load balancing, and high-
   bandwidth connections to keep up with demand. Even with those
   investments, the user experience may still be relatively poor due to
   congestion in the network as a whole.

   To address these limitations. another type of content network that
   has been deployed in increasing numbers in recent years is the

   Content Distribution Network, or CDN. A CDN essentially combines the
   cache-management approach of reverse caching proxies with the
   network placement of (forward) caching proxies. A CDN has multiple
   replicas of each content item being hosted. A request from a browser
   for a single content item is directed to a "good" replica, where
   "good" usually means that the item is served to the client quickly
   compared to the time it would take fetch it from the origin server,
   with appropriate integrity and consistency. Static information about
   geographic locations and network connectivity is usually not
   sufficient to do a good job of choosing a replica. Instead, a CDN
   typically incorporates dynamic information about network conditions
   and load on the replicas, directing requests so as to balance the
   load.

   Compared to using servers and caches in a single data center, a CDN
   is a relatively complex system encompassing multiple points of
   presence, in locations that may be geographically far apart.
   Operating a CDN is not easy for a content provider, since a content
   provider wants to focus its resources on developing high-value
   content, not on managing network infrastructure. Instead, a more
   typical arrangement is that a network service provider builds and
   operates a CDN, offering a content distribution service to a number
   of content providers.

   A CDN enables a service provider to act on behalf of the content
   provider to deliver copies of origin server content to clients from
   multiple diverse locations. The increase in number and diversity of
   location is intended to improve download times and thus improve the
   user experience. A CDN has some combination of a content-delivery
   infrastructure, a request-routing infrastructure, a distribution
   infrastructure, and an accounting infrastructure. The content-
   delivery infrastructure consists of a set of "surrogate" servers [3]
   that deliver copies of content to sets of users. The request-routing
   infrastructure consists of mechanisms that move a client toward a
   rendezvous with a surrogate. The distribution infrastructure
   consists of mechanisms that move content from the origin server to
   the surrogates. Finally, the accounting infrastructure tracks and
   collects data on request-routing, distribution, and delivery
   functions within the CDN.

   The following diagram depicts a simple CDN as described above:

2.4.1 Historic Evolution of CDNs

   The first important use of CDNs was for the distribution of heavily-
   requested graphic files (such as GIF files on the home pages of
   popular servers). However, both in principle and increasingly in
   practice, a CDN can support the delivery of any digital content --
   including various forms of streaming media.  For a streaming media
   CDN, the surrogates may be operating as splitters (serving out
   multiple copies of a stream). The splitter function may be instead
   of, or in addition to, a role as a caching proxy. However, the basic
   elements defined in this model are still intended to apply to the
   interconnection of content networks that are distributing streaming
   media. 

2.4.2 Describing CDN Value: Reach and Scale

   There are two fundamental elements that give a CDN value:
   outsourcing infrastructure and improved content delivery. A CDN
   allows multiple surrogates to act on behalf of an orgin server,
   therefore removing the delivery of content from a centralized site
   to multiple and (usually) highly distributed sites. We refer to
   increased aggregate infrastructure size as "scale." In addition, a
   CDN can be constructed with copies of content near to end users,
   overcoming issues of network size, network congestion, and network
   failures. We refer to increased diversity of content locations as
   "reach."

   (business) relationships with content publishers and acts on behalf
   of their origin sites to provide a distributed delivery system. The
   value of that CDN to a content provider is a combination of its
   scale and its reach.

3. Content Network Model Terms

   This section consists of the definitions of a number of terms used
   to refer to roles, participants, and objects involved in content
   networks.  Although the following uses many terms that are based on
   those used in RFC 2616 [1] or RFC 3040 [3], there is no necessary
   connection to HTTP or web caching technology. Content
   internetworking and this vocabulary are applicable to other
   protocols and styles of content delivery.

   ACCOUNTING 
      Measurement and recording of DISTRIBUTION and DELIVERY
      activities, especially when the information recorded is
      ultimately used as a basis for the subsequent transfer of money,
      goods, or obligations.

   ACCOUNTING SYSTEM 
      A collection of CONTENT NETWORK ELEMENTS that supports ACCOUNTING
      for a single CONTENT NETWORK.

   AUTHORITATIVE REQUEST-ROUTING SYSTEM 
      The REQUEST-ROUTING SYSTEM that is the correct/final authority
      for a particular item of CONTENT.

   CDN 
      Content Delivery Network or Content Distribution Network. A type
      of CONTENT NETWORK in which the CONTENT NETWORK ELEMENTS are
      arranged for more effective delivery of CONTENT to CLIENTS. 
      Typically a CDN consists of a REQUEST-ROUTING SYSTEM, SURROGATES,
      a DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, and an ACCOUNTING SYSTEM.

   CLIENT 
      A program that sends REQUESTs and receives corresponding
      RESPONSEs.  [Note: this is similar to the definition in RFC 2616
      [1] but we do not require establishment of a connection.]

   CONTENT 
      Any form of digital data, CONTENT approximately corresponds to
      what is referred to as an "entity" in RFC 2616 [1]. One important
      form of CONTENT with additional constraints on DISTRIBUTION and
      DELIVERY is CONTINUOUS MEDIA.

   CONTENT NETWORK 
      An arrangement of CONTENT NETWORK ELEMENTS, controlled by a
      common management in some fashion.

   CONTENT NETWORK ELEMENT 
      A network device that performs at least some of its processing by
      examining CONTENT-related parts of network messages.  In IP-based


Day, et. al.             Expires April 1, 2002                 [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                 CDI Model                    October 2001


      networks, a CONTENT NETWORK ELEMENT is a device whose processing
      depends on examining some or all of an IP packet's body; network
      elements (as defined in RFC 3040) examine only the header of an
      IP packet.  

   CONTENT REQUEST 
      A message identifying a particular item of CONTENT to be
      delivered.

   CONTENT RESPONSE 
      A message containing a particular item of CONTENT, identified in
      a previous CONTENT REQUEST.

   CONTENT SIGNAL 
      A message delivered through a DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM that specifies
      information about an item of CONTENT. For example, a CONTENT
      SIGNAL can indicate that the ORIGIN has a new version of some
      piece of CONTENT.

   CONTINUOUS MEDIA 
      CONTENT where there is a timing relationship between source and
      sink; that is, the sink must reproduce the timing relationship
      that existed at the source. The most common examples of
      CONTINUOUS MEDIA are audio and motion video. CONTINUOUS MEDIA can
      be real-time (interactive), where there is a "tight" timing
      relationship between source and sink, or streaming (playback),
      where the relationship is less strict. [Note: This definition is
      essentially identical to the definition of continuous media in
      [2]] 

   DELIVERY 
      The activity of presenting a PUBLISHER's CONTENT for consumption
      by a CLIENT. Contrast with DISTRIBUTION and REQUEST-ROUTING.

   DISTRIBUTION 
      The activity of moving a PUBLISHER's CONTENT from its ORIGIN to
      one or more SURROGATEs. DISTRIBUTION can happen either in
      anticipation of a SURROGATE receiving a REQUEST (pre-positioning)
      or in response to a SURROGATE receiving a REQUEST (fetching on
      demand). Contrast with DELIVERY and REQUEST-ROUTING.

   DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM 
      A collection of CONTENT NETWORK ELEMENTS that support
      DISTRIBUTION for a single CONTENT NETWORK. The DISTRIBUTION
      SYSTEM also propagates CONTENT SIGNALs.

   ORIGIN 
      The point at which CONTENT first enters a DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.
      The ORIGIN for any item of CONTENT is the server or set of

Internet-Draft                 CDI Model                    October 2001


      servers at the "core" of the distribution, holding the "master"
      or "authoritative" copy of that CONTENT. [Note: We believe this
      definition is compatible with that for "origin server" in RFC
      2616 [1] but includes additional constraints useful for CDI.]

   PUBLISHER 
      The party that ultimately controls the CONTENT and its
      distribution.

   REACHABLE SURROGATES 
      The collection of SURROGATES that can be contacted via a
      particular DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM or REQUEST-ROUTING SYSTEM.

   REQUEST-ROUTING 
      The activity of steering or directing a CONTENT REQUEST from a
      USER AGENT to a suitable SURROGATE.

   REQUEST-ROUTING SYSTEM 
      A collection of CONTENT NETWORK ELEMENTS that support
      REQUEST-ROUTING for a single CONTENT NETWORK.

   SERVER 
      A program that accepts REQUESTS and services them by sending back
      RESPONSES. Any given program may be capable of being both a
      client and a server; our use of these terms refers only to the
      role being performed by the program. [Note: this is adapted from
      a similar definition in RFC 2616 [1].] 

   SURROGATE 
      A delivery server, other than the ORIGIN. Receives a CONTENT
      REQUEST and delivers the corresponding CONTENT RESPONSE.  [Note:
      this is a different definition from that in RFC 3040 [3], which
      appears overly elaborate for our purposes.]

   USER AGENT 
      The CLIENT which initiates a REQUEST. These are often browsers,
      editors, spiders (web-traversing robots), or other end user
      tools. [Note: this definition is identical to the one in RFC 2616
      [1].]

4. Content Internetworking

   There are limits to how large any one network's scale and reach can
   be. Increasing either scale or reach is ultimately limited by the
   cost of equipment, the space available for deploying equipment,
   and/or the demand for that scale/reach of infrastructure. Sometimes
   a particular audience is tied to a single service provider or a
   small set of providers by constraints of technology, economics, or
   law. Other times, a network provider may be able to manage
   surrogates and a distribution system, but may have no direct
   relationship with content providers. Such a provider wants to have a
   means of affiliating their delivery and distribution infrastructure
   with other parties who have content to distribute.

   Content Internetworking allows different content networks to share
   resources so as to provide larger scale and/or reach to each
   participant than they could otherwise achieve. By using commonly
   defined protocols for content internetworking, each content network
   can treat neighboring content networks as "black boxes", allowing
   them to hide internal details from each other.

5. Content Internetworking Model Terms

   This section consists of the definitions of a number of terms used
   to refer to roles, participants, and objects involved in
   internetworking content networks.

   ACCOUNTING INTERNETWORKING 
      Interconnection of two or more ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS so as to enable
      the exchange of information between them. The form of ACCOUNTING
      INTERNETWORKING required may depend on the nature of the
      NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIP between the peering parties -- in
      particular, on the value of the economic exchanges anticipated.

   ADVERTISEMENT 
      Information about resources available to other CONTENT NETWORKS,
      exchanged via CONTENT INTERNETWORKING GATEWAYS. Types of
      ADVERTISEMENT include AREA ADVERTISEMENTS, CONTENT
      ADVERTISEMENTS, and DISTRIBUTION ADVERTISEMENTS.

   AREA ADVERTISEMENT 
      ADVERTISEMENT from a CONTENT NETWORK's REQUEST-ROUTING SYSTEM
      about aspects of topology, geography and performance of a CONTENT
      NETWORK.  Contrast with CONTENT ADVERTISEMENT, DISTRIBUTION
      ADVERTISEMENT.

   BILLING ORGANIZATION 
      An entity that operates an ACCOUNTING SYSTEM to support billing
      within a NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIP with a PUBLISHER.

   CONTENT ADVERTISEMENT 
      ADVERTISEMENT from a CONTENT NETWORK's REQUEST-ROUTING SYSTEM
      about the availability of one or more collections of CONTENT on a
      CONTENT NETWORK.  Contrast with AREA ADVERTISEMENT, DISTRIBUTION
      ADVERTISEMENT

   CONTENT DESTINATION 
      A CONTENT NETWORK or DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM that is accepting
      CONTENT from another such network or system. Contrast with
      CONTENT SOURCE.

   CONTENT INTERNETWORKING GATEWAY (CIG) 
      An identifiable element or system through which a CONTENT NETWORK
      can be interconnected with others.  through one or more kinds of
      peering. A CIG may be the point of contact for DISTRIBUTION
      INTERNETWORKING, REQUEST-ROUTING INTERNETWORKING, and/or
      ACCOUNTING INTERNETWORKING, and thus may incorporate some or all
      of the corresponding systems for the CONTENT NETWORK.

   CONTENT REPLICATION

Internet-Draft                 CDI Model                    October 2001


      The movement of CONTENT from a CONTENT SOURCE to a CONTENT
      DESTINATION.  Note that this is specifically the movement of
      CONTENT from one system or network to another.  There may be
      similar or different mechanisms that move CONTENT around within a
      single network's DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.

   CONTENT SOURCE 
      A CONTENT NETWORK or DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM that is distributing
      CONTENT to another such network or system. Contrast with CONTENT
      DESTINATION. 

   DISTRIBUTION ADVERTISEMENT 
      An ADVERTISEMENT from a CONTENT NETWORK's DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM to
      potential CONTENT SOURCES, describing the capabilities of one or
      more CONTENT DESTINATIONS.  Contrast with AREA ADVERTISEMENT,
      CONTENT ADVERTISEMENT.

   DISTRIBUTION INTERNETWORKING 
      Interconnection of two or more DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS so as to
      propagate CONTENT SIGNALS and copies of CONTENT to groups of
      SURROGATES.

   INJECTION 
      A "send-only" form of DISTRIBUTION INTERNETWORKING that takes
      place from an ORIGIN to a CONTENT DESTINATION.

   INTER- 
      Describes activity that involves more than one CONTENT NETWORK
      (e.g. INTER-CDN). Contrast with INTRA-.

   INTRA- 
      Describes activity within a single CONTENT NETWORK (e.g. INTRA-
      CDN). Contrast with INTER-.

   NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIP 
      A relationship whose terms and conditions are partially or
      completely established outside the context of CONTENT NETWORK
      internetworking protocols.

   REMOTE CONTENT NETWORK 
      A CONTENT NETWORK able to deliver CONTENT for a particular
      REQUEST that is not the AUTHORITATIVE REQUEST-ROUTING SYSTEM for
      that REQUEST.

   REQUEST-ROUTING ADVERTISEMENT 
      An ADVERTISEMENT from a CONTENT NETWORK's REQUEST-ROUTING PEERING
      SYSTEM describing the availability of collections of CONTENT via
      that CONTENT NETWORK's REQUEST-ROUTING SYSTEM.

   REQUEST-ROUTING INTERNETWORKING 
      Interconnection of two or more REQUEST-ROUTING SYSTEMS so as to
      increase the number of REACHABLE SURROGATES for at least one of
      the interconnected systems.

6. Operational Considerations

   [Editor's Note: Consider problem of incorrect advertisements of
   content or service levels. Need to ensure that there are means
   within the protocol or recommended practices so that CDNs aren't
   encouraged to pull traffic they can't really handle.]

7. Security Considerations

   There are no security-related issues related to the terms defined in
   this document. The technology of content internetworking does raise
   some security-related issues, and a detailed discussion of those
   issues appears in "Content Internetworking Architectural Overview"
   [6].
