1.  Introduction

   In future, many new services would emerge in the network, such as the
   5G URLLC (Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication) service, and the
   holographic type communications.  Many of the new services need a
   higher QoS (Quality of Service) level than the current Internet
   services, and some of them have a critical SLA (Service-Level
   Agreement) requirement.  The SLA differences between the new services
   and traditional services would become larger and lager.  However,
   current networks can only provide the Best Effort bearing, in which
   all the traffic are treated as the same kind.  In summary, current
   networks are short of negotiation abilities between the network and
   the applications.  PANRG in the IRTF has proposed a research
   direction to enable the path aware networking.  A lot of analyses
   have been done in the [RFC9049], which explains reasons why various
   Path Aware techniques have seen limited or no deployment.

   One of the reasons is that it is hard to establish a trust
   relationship between the Endpoint and Intermediate Node.  In the
   current network structure, the Endpoints only needs to be aware of
   the each other, and assume that the network can provide a good
   connection service for them.  On the other hand, traditionally,
   Intermediate Nodes only need to support IP forwarding and do not need
   to be aware of up-layer information.  In addition, the network nodes
   work in a per-packet model, not a per-flow model.  Also in the
   [RFC9049], it is said that "per-connection state in intermediate
   nodes has been an impediment to adoption and deployment".

   However, we can find that the gateway of the Endpoint is able to
   maintain a per-connection state and a trust-relationship for each

   user.  For example, the users in the fixed network need to be
   authorized by the BNG (Broadband Network Gateway), and the BNG also
   needs to do the accounting for each user.  It is hard and unnecessary
   to make every intermediate node along the path has the same ability
   as the BNG; however, if they can have some communication with the
   BNG, perhaps they can make a better path choice for the user.
   Following this direction, this document proposes a mechanism about
   how to enable the communication between the BNG and the Head-End node
   in the network, because the Head-End node is the main node to select
   the path for a flow in the network.  If any future work on the trust
   relationship between the Endpoint and the Intermediate Node is
   considered, the mechanism in this document can be a reference.

2.  Proposed Mechanism for the Trust Problem

   As shown in the Figure 1, in the fixed network, the BNG works as the
   gateway for the Client, and provides the Internet connection service
   for the Applications.  The Client and Server are the EndPoints, and
   the BNG, Head-End, Mid-Node, End-Node are the nodes along the path
   from the Client to the Server.  There are three paths, i.e., A, B, C,
   with different properties such as high bandwidth or low latency,
   between the Head-End and the End-Node in the network.

   By default, all the traffic from the APPs are forwarded from the
   Head-End to the End-Node with the same treatment in the network.  In
   the Head-end, perhaps a load balance mechanism can be enabled, but
   normally without any per-flow mechanism, because the Head-End does
   not know the requirements of each flow.  If the Applications need
   different treatments in the network, and the Head-End can schedule
   the traffic to a proper path, the user can have a better experience
   and the network resource can be used more efficiently.

   potential solutions for them.

   The first problem is the path information collection for the
   Endpoints.  The Endpoints should be able to trust the path
   information that the Intermediate Nodes signal.  As a first step, we
   only consider the situation that information is limited and does not
   need to be updated frequently.  In this case, if the Head-End needs
   to inform the Endpoints something, it can send the information with
   its signature generated by using a private key.  The Endpoints can
   check the information using the corresponding public key.  For
   example, the public key can be obtained by the Endpoint in the
   authentication procedure.

   The second problem is the Head-End should trust the Endpoints if it
   receives some path selection suggestions from the Endpoints.  In this
   case, we think that the BNG has authenticated the Endpoints, so that
   the BNG can send some information to the Head-End indicating that the
   Endpoint is not a fake one.  For example, the BNG and the Head-End
   can using an IPSec to transfer the traffic that needs specific
   treatment.  Another option is that the BNG can forward the traffic
   that needs specific treatment with its signature generated by using a
   private key.  The Head-End can check the information using the
   corresponding public key of the BNG.

   The reason that we do not suggest that the Endpoints make the
   signature is because their number is much larger than the number of
   BNGs.  We do not think the Head-End can handle a large number of
   keys.  Meanwhile, in this mechanism, the Intermediate Node does not
   need to maintain per-connection state.
