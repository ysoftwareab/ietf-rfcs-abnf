              IPv6 Transition Technologies Selection in NFV
               draft-hui-v6ops-ipv6trans-select-nfv-00.txt


Abstract

   Nowadays, many IPv6 transition technologies have been proposed, such
   as Dual-Stack, 6rd and so on.  A CPE may support some of them 
   instead of only one.  But the ISPs always support different kinds of
   transition technologies, such as Dual-Stack, DS-lite and so on.  So
   they must control all the CPEs to match the exact transition tech
   through some standard messages. When the ISP network uses NFV, the 
   message communication will between the network gateway and the V-CPE
   to configure the IPv6 transition technology in CPE.

1.  Problem Statement
   Nowadays, many IPv6 transitioning technologies has been proposed such
   as Dual-Stack, DS-Lite, 6rd and so on.  Each of them proposes 
   individual requirement to the CPEs.  To promote the competitive 
   ability of products, the CPE manufacturers certainly will try to 
   support more technologies as much as possible.  Meanwhile, the 
   operators tend to use single or less technologies.  Moreover, users 
   can buy and use their own equipments instead of using the one which 
   operator gives them, that will bring the diversity of CPEs.
   
   Assume that an operator uses one or more transitioning strategies in 
   its NFV network.  There are two ways to make the CPEs available.  
   The first one is to make a pre-configuration for each CPE in advance.
   But, when the users modify the configuration or change to their own 
   equipment, the connection will fail.  The Second method is to deploy
   Network Management System (NMS) to configure all the CPEs.  Various 
   CPEs from different manufactories usually need different NMS which 
   means either the operator needs to maintain multiple NMS in their 
   network or operator can only use one manufacturer's product in a 
   subnet.  What's worse, when users buy and use their own CPE instead 
   of using the original one, there will be no any solutions to 
   configure correctly except visiting service.
   
   NFV makes the vCPE to control the CPE, so we need some messages to 
   configure the IPv6 transition tech between network gateway and vCPE.
