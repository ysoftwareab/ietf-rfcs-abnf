1.  Introduction

   The MMTP protocol is an application layer transport protocol that is
   designed to transport different types of media objects under real-
   time delivery constraints.  In particular, MMTP provides a delivery
   mode that is optimized for low-delay delivery of fragmented ISOBMFF
   media files.  The Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566])
   provides a general-purpose format for describing multimedia sessions
   in announcements or invitations.  SDP uses an entirely textual data
   format (the US-ASCII subset of UTF-8 [RFC3629]) to simplify authoring
   and increase readability.  SDP only defines the syntax to describe
   multimedia sessions with sufficient information to enable receivers
   to participate in the session.  SDP does not restrict the way the
   session description is distributed to the receivers, so that
   potentially any transport protocol (e.g.  HTTP [RFC2616], MMTP
   [draftMMTP], SAP [RFC2974], SIP [RFC3261]) may be used for this
   purpose.  This document defines a new protocol identifier for the
   MPEG Media Transport Protocol (MMTP) as well as other SDP attributes
   for describing and initiating an MMTP session.  The formal ABNF
   syntax [RFC5234] is used for defining the syntax of the new SDP
   attributes.  The defined SDP descriptors apply independently of
   whether Any Source Multicast (ASM) or Source Specific Multicast (SSM)
   is used to route the media.

2.  MMTP Descriptors

   The MMTP specification [draftMMTP] describes the required and
   optional parameters for describing an MMTP session.  This document
   specifies the SDP parameters for MMTP sessions that can be used for

   the discovery of MMTP sessions.  The required SDP parameters for
   describing an MMTP session are:

      The destination information, consisting of the destination IP
      address and port number.

      An indication that the session is an MMTP session

      The version number of the MMTP protocol used in the current MMTP
      session

   The optional SDP parameters are:

      The start and end time of the MMTP session

      Bandwidth specification

      Description of the object flows of the MMTP session

   An MMTP session consists of one or more object flows, each of which
   is identified by a unique packet identifier.  The packets that belong
   to the same object flow use the same packet identifier and build a
   sub-flow of the MMTP flow.  The description of the SDP parameters is
   provided in the following sections.

2.1.  MMTP Protocol Identifier

   The ABNF syntax for the "m=" line as specified by [RFC4566] is
   defined as follows: media-field = "m=" media SP port {"/" integer] SP
   proto 1*(SP fmt) CRLF proto = "MMTP/UDP" The "MMTP/UDP" protocol
   identifier specifies that the the session being described will use
   the MMTP protocol [draftMMTP] on top of a UDP connection.  The "fmt"
   list may be used to describe the object flows that are delivered as
   part of the MMTP session.

2.2.  Object Flow Semantics

   An MMTP session consists of an MMTP flow that is delivered during a
   designated period of time that is indicated by the session start and
   end time or through external means.  Each MMTP sub-flow carries
   objects of an object flow.  An object flow is composed of a set of
   related objects that are meant to be consumed together by the
   receiver.  An object flow may carry objects of one of the following
   types:

      media objects that are formatted as fragmented ISOBMFF files and
      that are meant to be consumed sequentially.  In MMT terms, MPUs

      would constitute the objects of such an object flow, which is
      named as Asset.

      the object flow consists of generic objects that are meant to be
      consumed simultaneously or in sequence.

      the object flow consists of objects that carry signaling messages
      that are relevant to the consumption of the MMTP flow.

      the object flow carries FEC repair packets.

   The SDP descriptors enables providing basic descriptive information
   about the object flow.  The related SDP parameters are described in
   the following section.

2.3.  Object Flow Descriptors

   This internet draft specifies a set of SDP descriptors to describe
   the content of an MMTP session.  It uses the "fmt" to identify the
   relevant object flows of an MMTP session and indicate its type.  In
   addition, a textual description of the object flow may be provided
   separately.  The ABNF syntax of the object flow description is
   defined as follows: of-descriptor = "a=of:" fmt SP of-identifier SP
   type-indicator CRLF of-identifier = "flowid=" 1*DIGIT type-indicator
   = "type=" type ["/" subtype] type = "MPU" / "GF" / "Signaling" /
   "FEC" The flowid is set to the packet_id of the MMTP subflow that
   carries the objects of this object flow.  The type of the object flow
   corresponds to one of the object flow types described in Section 2.2.
   The subtype field is a type specific optional field that can be used
   to indicate a more specific type of the object flow.  As an example,
   a subtype "MP" of type "signaling" may be used to indicate that the
   object flow carries (possibly among others) the MP tables of this
   MMTP session.

3.  SDP Syntax Examples

   This section gives examples of the use of SDP attributes to describe
   an MMTP session.

            Figure 1: An example SDP describing an MMTP session

   Section 3 shows an example SDP instance for an MMTP session.  The
   MMTP session declares a set of 5 object flows.  The first object
   flow, which has the packet_id 0, is the flow that carries signaling
   messages and in particular PA messages that describe the MMT
   services.  Object flows with packet_id 7623 and 7624 carry media data
   of 2 different assets using the MPU mode.  Object flow with packet_id
   7625 carries generic files that are carried using the GFD mode.
   Finally, object flow with packet_id 7626 carries FEC repair data for
   one or more other object flows.  The description of the FEC protected
   object flows is provided through the FEC signaling message.

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  Transport Protocol

   The "proto" sub-field of media description field ("m=") describes the
   transport protocol used.  This document registers the following value
   "MMTP/UDP" as the MMTP transport protocol [draftMMTP] over UDP/IP.

4.2.  Media Formats

   This document registers the following "fmt" values: "Signaling",
   "MPU", "GF", and "FEC".  These values correspond to the payload type
   fields of MMTP.  The MMTP media line may use "*" as the "fmt" value.
   In that case, no specific indication of the contained object flows is
   made.

4.3.  Attribute Names

   This document registers the following attribute: "of" with IANA, with
   the following information:
