    Segment Routing based Virtual Transport Network for Enhanced VPN
                draft-dong-spring-sr-for-enhanced-vpn-10

Abstract

   I-D.ietf-spring-resource-aware-segments describes the mechanism to
   associate network resource attributes to Segment Routing Identifiers
   (SIDs).  The resource-aware SIDs can be used to build SR paths with a
   set of reserved network resources.  In addition, the resource-aware
   SIDs can be used to build SR based virtual networks, which can be
   used as virtual underlay networks with the network topology and
   resource attributes required by different customers or services.
   Such virtual networks are called virtual transport networks (VTNs).
   This document describes the mechanism of using resource-aware SIDs to
   build SR based VTNs.

1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) [RFC8402] specifies a mechanism to steer packets
   through an ordered list of segments.  A segment is referred to by its
   Segment Identifier (SID).  With SR, explicit source routing can be
   achieved without introducing per-path state into the network.  While
   compared with RSVP-TE [RFC3209], currently SR does not have the
   capability of reserving network resources or identifying a set of
   network resources reserved for services or customers.
   [I-D.ietf-spring-resource-aware-segments] extends the SR paradigm by

   associating SIDs with network resource attributes.  On a network
   segment, multiple resource-aware SIDs can be allocated, each of which
   represents a subset of network resources allocated to meet the
   requirement of some customers or services.  The resource-aware SIDs
   can be used to build SR paths with a set of reserved network
   resources.  In addition, the resource-aware SIDs can also be used to
   build SR based virtual networks with the required network topology
   and resource attributes.  A group of resource-aware SIDs together can
   be used to specify the customized topology of a virtual network, and
   can further be used to steer the service traffic to be processed with
   the set of network resources allocated to the virtual network.  Such
   virtual networks are called virtual transport networks (VTNs), which
   can be used as the underlay of enhanced VPN services as described in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn].

   This document describes the mechanism of using resource-aware SIDs to
   build SR based VTNs.  Although the procedure is illustrated using SR-
   MPLS, the proposed mechanism is applicable to both segment routing
   over MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) and segment routing over IPv6 data
   plane (SRv6).

2.  Resource-Aware SIDs for VTN

   When SR is used as the data plane to provide multiple VTNs in one
   network, it is necessary that SR paths in a VTN are computed with the
   topology constraints, and are instantiated with the set of network
   resources allocated to the VTN.  With the mechanism defined in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-resource-aware-segments], multiple SR SIDs can be
   allocated for each network segment, and each SID can be used to
   identify both the network topology and the set of network resources
   allocated on the network segment for a VTN.  The mechanisms to
   identify the network topology or forwarding path with a SID as
   defined in [RFC8402] are reused, and the control plane can be based
   on [RFC4915], [RFC5120] and [I-D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo].

2.1.  SR-MPLS

   For one IGP link, multiple Adj-SIDs are allocated, each of which is
   associated with a VTN the link participates, and represents a subset
   of the link resources allocated to the VTN.  Similarly, for one IGP
   node, multiple prefix-SIDs are allocated, each of which is associated
   with a VTN the node participate, and represent a subset of the node
   level processing resources allocated to the VTN.

   In the case of multi-domain VTNs, on an inter-domain link, multiple
   BGP peering SIDs [I-D.ietf-idr-bgpls-segment-routing-epe] are
   allocated, each of which is associated with a VTN which spans

Internet-Draft                 SR for VPN+                   August 2020


   multiple domains, and represents a subset of resources allocated on
   the inter-domain link.

   This way, a group of resource-aware SIDs associated with the same VTN
   can be used to represent the VTN topology and the allocated resources
   in data plane.  An SR SID-list built with such group of SIDs can be
   used to steer service traffic to follow a path within the VTN
   topology, and each SID in the SID-list can also be used to steer the
   service traffic to be processed with the set of network resources
   allocated to the VTN.

   Note that the introduction of SR-MPLS based VTN increases the number
   of SIDs needed, and the amount network states is also increased.
   While thanks to the SR paradigmn, the resource-aware SIDs are
   associated with different VTNs rather than different paths, thus per-
   path state is still avoided inside the SR network.

2.2.  SRv6

   In order to support multiple VTNs with SRv6, network nodes (including
   both the edge nodes and transit nodes) belonging to the same VTN need
   to have a consistent view of the VTN, and perform consistent
   computation and forwarding behavior to comply to the VTN topology and
   resource constraints.  The mechanisms to ensure the consistency of
   such view can be based on [RFC4915], [RFC5120] and
   [I-D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo].  In data plane, some mechanism is needed
   for nodes to identify the VTN a packets belongs to.

   Based on the mechanisms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-resource-aware-segments], for a network node,
   multiple SRv6 LOCs are allocated, each of which is associated with a
   VTN it participates, and represents a subset of the network resources
   allocated to the VTN.  The SRv6 SIDs of a particular VTN are
   allocated from the SID space using the VTN-specific LOC as the
   prefix.  These SRv6 SIDs can be used to represent VTN-specific local
   functions.

   A group of SRv6 SIDs associated with the same VTN can be used to
   represent the VTN topology and the allocated resources in data plane.
   An SRv6 SID-list built with such SIDs can be used to steer the
   service traffic to follow a path within the VTN topology, and each
   SID in the SID-list can also be used to steer the service traffic to
   be processed with the set of network resources allocated to the VTN.

   Note that the introduction of SRv6 based VTN increases the number of
   SRv6 Locators and SIDs needed, and the amount network states is also
   increased.  While thanks to the SR paradigmn, the resource-aware SIDs

   are associated with different VTNs rather than different paths, thus
   per-path state is still avoided in the SR network.

3.  Procedures

   This section describes the procedures of creating SR based VTNs and
   the corresponding forwarding tables and entries.  Although it is
   illustrated using SR-MPLS, the proposed mechanism is applicable to
   both SR-MPLS and SRv6.

   According to the received service requirement, a centralized network
   controller calculates a subset of the network topology to support the
   service.  Within this topology, the set of network resources required
   on each network element is also determined.  The subset of network
   topology and network resources together constitute a VTN.  Depending
   on the service requirement, the network topology and resource can be
   dedicated for a individual service or customer, or can be shared by a
   group of services or customers.

   Based on the mechanisms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-resource-aware-segments], the network topology and
   resources of a VTN can be represented by a group of resource-aware
   SIDs.  With SR-MPLS, a group of prefix-SIDs and adj-SIDs will be used
   by network nodes and the network controller to construct an SR based
   VTN, which is considered as the virtual underlay network for the
   service.  Control plane protocols such as IGP and BGP-LS needs to be
   extended to distribute the SIDs and the associated resource
   information of each VTN.  The detailed control plane extensions are
   out of the scope of this document.

   Suppose a virtual network is requested by some customer or service.
   The basic requirement is that customer or service is allocated with
   some dedicated network resource and does not experience unexpected
   interference from other services in the same network.  Other possible
   requirements may include the required topology, bandwidth, latency,
   reliability, etc.

3.1.  VTN Topology and Resource Computation

   A centralized network controller can be responsible for the planning
   of a VTN to meet the received service request.  The controller needs
   to collect the information of network connectivity, network
   resources, network performance and other relevant network states of
   the underlay network.  This can be done using either IGP [RFC5305]
   [RFC3630] [RFC7471] [RFC8570] or BGP-LS [RFC7752] [RFC8571].

   Based on the information collected from the underlay network, the
   controller obtains the underlay network topology and the information



Dong, et al.              Expires March 4, 2021                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                 SR for VPN+                   August 2020


   about the allocated and available network resources.  When a service
   request is received, the controller computes the subset of the
   network topology, along with the set of the resources needed on each
   network segment (e.g. links and nodes) in the topology to meet the
   service requirements, whilst maintaining the needs of the existing
   services that are using the same network.  The subset of network
   topology and network resources constitute a VTN, which will be used
   as the virtual underlay network of the requested service.

3.2.  VTN Network Resource and SID Allocation

   According to the result of VTN planning, the network controller
   instructs the network nodes with the information of the VTN
   identifier and the required network resources to be allocated to the
   VTN, so that the involved network nodes could join the VTN and
   allocate the network resources accordingly.  This can be done with
   either PCEP [RFC5440] or Netconf/YANG [RFC6241] [RFC7950] with
   necessary extensions.  On each network node involved in the VTN, a
   set of network resources are allocated on a per virtual network
   basis, and a group of resource-aware SIDs are allocated to represent
   the set of resources allocated on the network node and the attached
   links.  Such group of resource-aware SIDs, e.g.  prefix-SIDs and adj-
   SIDs are used as data plane identifiers of the node and links in the
   VTN.

   In underlying forwarding plane, there can be multiple ways of
   partitioning and allocating a set of network resource to a VTN.  For
   example, [FLEXE] may be used to partition the link resource into
   different sub-channels to achieve resource isolation between each
   other.  The candidate data plane technologies to support resource
   partitioning can be found in [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn].  The SR
   SIDs are considered as a unified abstraction in network layer , which
   can work with various network resource partition and allocation
   mechanisms in the underlying forwarding plane.

 Figure 1. SID and resource allocation for multiple VTNs

   Figure 1 shows an example of providing multiple VTNs in an SR based
   network.  Note that the format of the SIDs in this figure is for
   illustration, both SR-MPLS and SRv6 can be used as the data plane.
   In this example, three VTNs: red (r) , green (g) and blue (b) are
   created to carry different services.  Both the red and green VTNs
   consist of nodes A, B, C, D, and E with all their interconnecting
   links, whilst the blue VTN only consists of nodes A, B, C and D with
   all their interconnecting links.  Note that different VTNs may have a
   set of shared nodes and links.  On each link, a resource-aware adj-
   SID is allocated for each VTN it participates in.

   In Figure 1, the notation x:nnnn:y means that in VTN x, the adj-SID
   nnnn will steer the packet over a link which has bandwidth y reserved
   for that VTN.  For example, r:1002:1G in link C->D says that the VTN
   red has a reserved bandwidth of 1Gb/s on link C->D, and will be used
   by packets arriving at node C with an adj-SID 1002 at the top of the
   label stack.  Similarly, on each node, a resource-aware prefix-SID is
   allocated for each VTN it participates in.  The adj-SIDs can be
   associated with different set of link resources (e.g. bandwidth)
   allocated to different VTNs, so that the adj-SIDs can be used to

   steer service traffic into different set of link resources in packet
   forwarding.  The prefix-SIDs can be associated with the nodal
   resources allocated to different VTNs.  In addition, the prefix-SIDs
   can be used to build loose SR path within each VTN, in this case it
   can be used by the transit nodes to steer service traffic into the
   set of local network resources allocated to the VTN in forwarding
   plane.

3.3.  Construction of SR based VTNs

   In order to make both the network controller and network nodes aware
   of the information of the VTNs in the network, each network node
   needs to advertise the identifiers of the VTNs it participates in,
   together with the group of SIDs and the associated resource
   attributes both to other network nodes and the controller.  This can
   be achieved by IGP extensions in [I-D.dong-lsr-sr-enhanced-vpn] and
   BGP-LS extensions in[I-D.dong-idr-bgpls-sr-enhanced-vpn].

   Based on the collected information of the topology, the allocated
   network resource information and the associated SIDs of VTN, the
   controller and network nodes are able to construct the SR based VTNs
   and generate the forwarding tables and entries of each VTN based on
   the prefix-SIDs and adj-SIDs of each VTN.  Unlike classic segment
   routing in which network resources on a network segment are shared by
   all the SR traffic, different SR VTNs can be associated with
   different set of resources allocated in the underlay forwarding
   plane, so that they can be used to meet the enhanced service
   requirement and provide the required resource isolation from other
   services in the same network.

   Figure 2 shows the SR based VTNs created in the network in Figure 1.

Figure 2.  SR based VTNs with different groups of SIDs

   For each SR based VTN, SR paths are computed within the VTN, taking
   the VTN topology and resources as constraints.  The SR path can be an
   explicit path instantiated using SR policy

   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy], in which the SID-list is
   built only with the SIDs allocated to the VTN.  The SR path can also
   be an IGP computed path associated with a prefix-SID of the VTN, the
   IGP computation is based on the VTN constraints.  Different SR paths
   in the same VTN may use shared network resources according to the
   resource-aware SIDs allocated to the VTN, while SR paths in different
   VTNs can be steered to use different set of network resources over
   the shared network links or nodes.  These VTN-specific SR paths need
   to be installed in the corresponding forwarding tables.

   For example, to create an explicit path A-B-D-E in VTN red in
   Figure 2, the SR SID-list encapsulated in the service packet would be
   (1001, 1002, 1003).  For the same explicit path A-B-D-E in VTN green,
   the SR segment list would be (2001, 2002, 2003).  In the case where
   we wish to construct a loose path A-D-E in VTN green, the service
   packet SHOULD be encapsulated with the SR SID-list (201, 204, 205).
   At node A, the packet can be sent towards D via either node B or C
   using the link and node resources allocated for VTN green.  At node D
   the packet is forwarded to E using the link and node resource
   allocated for VTN green.  Similarly, a packet to sent via loose path
   A-D-E in VTN red would be encapsulated with segment list (101, 104,
   105).  In the case where an IGP computed path can meet the service
   requirement, the packet can be simply encapsulated with the prefix-
   SID of egress node E in the corresponding VTN.

3.4.  Mapping Service to SR based VTN

   Network services can be provisioned using customized SR based VTN as
   the underlay network.  For example, different services may be
   provisioned in different SR based VTNs, each of which would use the
   network resources allocated to the VTN, so that they will not
   interfere with each other.  In another case, a group of services
   which have similar characteristics and requirement may be provisioned
   in the same VTN, in this case the network resources allocated to the
   VTN are only shared among this group of services, but will not be
   shared with other services in the network.  The steering of service
   traffic to SR based VTNs can be based on either local policy or
   mechanisms as defined in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].

3.5.  VTN Visibility to Customer

   The customer may request different granularity of visibility to the
   network which deliver the service.  Depending on the requirement, the
   network can be exposed to the customer either as a virtual network,
   or a set of computed paths with transit nodes, or simply the abstract
   connectivity between endpoints without any path information.  The
   visibility can be delivered through different possible mechanisms,
   such as IGPs (e.g.  IS-IS, OSPF) or BGP-LS.  In addition, network



Dong, et al.              Expires March 4, 2021                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                 SR for VPN+                   August 2020


   operator may want to restrict the visibility of the information it
   delivers to the customer by either hiding the transit nodes between
   sites (and only delivering the endpoints connectivity), or by hiding
   portions of the transit nodes (summarizing the path into fewer
   nodes).  Mechanisms such as BGP-LS allow the flexibility of the
   advertisement of aggregated virtual network information.

4.  Benefits of the Proposed Mechanism

   The proposed mechanism provides several key characteristics:

   o  Flexibility: Multiple customized VTNs can be created in a shared
      network to meet different customers' connectivity and service
      requirement.  Each customer is only aware of the topology and
      attributes of his own VTN, and provision services on the VTN
      instead of the physical network.  This provides an efficient
      mechanism to support network slicing.

   o  Resource Isolation: The computation and instantiation of SR paths
      in one VTN can be independent from other VTNs or other services in
      the network.  In addition, a VTN can be associated with a set of
      network resources, which can avoid resource competition and
      performance interference from other services in the network.  The
      proposed mechanism also allows resource sharing between different
      service flows of the same customer, or between a group of services
      which are provisioned in the same VTN.  This gives the operator
      and the customers the flexibility in network planning and service
      provisioning.  The performance of critical services can be further
      ensured using the mechanisms defined in [DetNet].

   o  Scalability: The introduction of resource guaranteed paths or
      virtual networks would increase the amount of state to the
      network.  The proposed mechanism seeks to achieve a balance
      between the state limitations of traditional end-to-end TE
      mechanism and the lack of resource awareness in classic segment
      routing.  Following the segment routing paradigm, network
      resources are allocated on network segments per VTN and
      represented as SIDs, thus there is no per-flow state introduced in
      the network.  Operator can choose the granularity of resource
      allocation to network segments.  In network segments where
      resource is scarce such that the service requirement may not
      always be met, the proposed approach can be used to allocate
      specific resources to a VTN which contains such network segment.
      By contrast, in other segment of the network where resource is
      considered plentiful, the resource may be shared between a number
      of VTNs.  The decision to do this is in the hands of the operator.
      Because of the segmented nature of the SR based VTN, resource

      aggregation is easier and more flexible than RSVP-TE based
      approach.

5.  Service Assurance

   In order to provide service assurance for services provisioned in the
   SR based VTNs, it is necessary to instrument the network at multiple
   levels.  The network operator needs to ascertain that the underlay
   network is operating correctly.  A tenant needs to ascertain that
   their services are operating correctly.  In principle these can use
   existing techniques.  These are well known problems and solutions
   either exist or are in development to address them.

   New work may be needed to instrument the VTNs that are created for
   particular services.  Such instrumentation needs to operate without
   causing disruption to other services using the network.  Given the
   sensitivity of some applications, care needs to be taken to ensure
   that the instrumentation itself does not cause disruption either to
   the service being instrumented or to other services.  In case of
   failure or performance degradation of a service path in a particular
   VTN, it is necessary that either local protection or end-to-end
   protection mechanism is used to switch to another path in the same
   VTN which could meet the service performance requirement and does not
   impact other services in the network.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of segment routing and resource-aware
   SIDs are applicable to this document.

   The SR VTNs may be used carry services with specific SLA parameters.
   An attack can be directly targeted at the customer application by
   disrupting the SLA, and can be targeted at the network operator by
   causing them to violate their SLA, triggering commercial
   consequences.  By rigorously policing ingress traffic and carefully
   provisioning the resources provided to the VTN, this type of attack
   can be prevented.  However care needs to be taken when shared
   resources are provided between VTNs at some point in the network, and
   when the network needs to be reconfigured as part of ongoing
   maintenance or in response to a failure.

   The details of the underlying network should not be exposed to third
   parties, some abstraction would be needed, this is also to prevent
   attacks aimed at exploiting a shared resource between VTNs.
