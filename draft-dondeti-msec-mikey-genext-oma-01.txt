   MIKEY General Extension payload specified in this document will be
   used for that purpose.

Internet-Draft  OMA BCAST MIKEY General Extension Payload       May 2006


1.  Introduction

   The Multimedia Internet Keying (MIKEY) protocol specification [1]
   defines a General Extension payload to allow possible extensions to
   MIKEY without having to define new payloads.  The General Extension
   payload can be used in any MIKEY message and is part of the
   authenticated/signed data part.  There is an 8-bit type field in that
   payload and the type code assignment is IANA managed and RFC 3830
   requires IETF consensus for assignments from the public range of
   0-240.

   The Open Mobile Alliance's (OMA) Browser and Content (BAC) Broadcast
   (BCAST) group's Service and Content Protection specification [2]
   specifies the use of a short term key message (STKM) and a long term
   key message (LTKM) that carry attributes related to service and
   content protection.  Note that any keys associated with the
   attributes are part of the MIKEY KEMAC payload.  This document
   specifies the use of the General Extension payload of MIKEY to carry
   the LTKMs or STKMs.

   RFC 3830, the MIKEY General Extension payload specified in [3] along
   with the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)'s Multimedia
   Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS) [4] specification specify the
   transport of MIKEY messages via unicast or broadcast and the OMA
   specifications use either for transport of MIKEY messages.


2.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [5].

      OMA BCAST MIKEY General Extension payload: We refer to the General
      Extension payload type -- value, to be assigned by IANA -- as the
      OMA BCAST MIKEY General Extension payload.

   Figure 1: OMA BCAST MIKEY General Extension Payload

   Section 6.1 of RFC 3830 specifies the first three fields of the
   General Extension Payload and defines a variable length Data field.
   This specification requests a Type value to be assigned for the OMA
   BCAST MIKEY General Extension payload.  The data field is opaque to
   the IETF and is specified in the OMA BCAST Service and Content
   Protection specification [2].

   The plan is to define an 8-bit type value to indicate STKM or LTKM
   and include all the STKM and LTKM fields as specified in [2].


4.  Interoperability considerations

   This document requests a MIKEY [1] General Extension Payload Type
   number from IANA through IETF review.  The payload defined is
   relevant to the 3GPP MBMS adaptation of the OMA BCAST 1.0
   specification.  Interoperability considerations span at least 3 SDOs
   and as such it is up to the OMA test planning to verify the
   interoperability of the MBMS adaptation of OMA BCAST 1.0.  This
   payload type assignment does not change MIKEY beyond RFC 3830 and
   [3].


5.  Security Considerations

   According to RFC 3830, the general extension payload can be used in
   any MIKEY message and is part of the authenticated/signed data part.
   The parameters proposed to be included in the OMA BCAST MIKEY General
   Extension payload (listed in Section Section 3) need only to be
   integrity protected, which is already allowed by the MIKEY
   specification.  The OMA BCAST MIKEY General Extension Payload SHALL
   be integrity protected.  Furthermore, keys or any parameters that
   require confidentiality MUST NOT be included in the General Extension
   Payload.  Note that MIKEY already provides replay protection and that
   protection covers the General Extension Payload also.

6.  IANA Considerations

   Please provide the next available number from the "General Extensions
   payload name spaces" in the IANA registry at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/mikey-payloads for use by OMA BCAST
   GenExt payload.
