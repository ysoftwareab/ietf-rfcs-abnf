1.  Introduction

   This document describes LEMONADE profile bis.  It contains pointers
   or mention to all the features that are normatively part of LEMONADE
   profile bis.

   It is based on LEMONADE profile [4] with extensions to provide the
   support to a realization of OMA mobile email enabler (MEM) using
   Internet Mail protocols defined by the IETF.  Many of these protocols
   have been enhanced by the LEMONADE work group for use in the mobile
   environment and are summarized in the LEMONADE profile [4].

   This document also supports the requirements captured in OMA MEM
   Requirement document [3] and mechanisms of the OMA MEM Architecture
   [2], following the LEMONADE point of view described in the  OMA MEM
   realization internet draft [21].

   This document contains the current view of the work.  It refers to
   stable specifications and work in progress.  As the work progress, it
   is expected that this document will evolve and be updated
   accordingly.

   <Editor's note: As a result some of the statements about some
   specification may not yet supported by the references.  When it is
   the case, these specifications are expected to be be updated.>

   <Editor's note: Caveats to be removed and / or updated when work
   stabilizes.>

   Also, it is to be noted that this document solely describes
   normatively the LEMONADE profile bis.  It discusses LEMONADE
   understanding of the work in progress at OMA MEM ([3] and [2] but
   does not provide a normative reading of these documents.  Readers
   MUST refer to the open mobiel alliance web site for normative
   references on the Mobile Email Enabler (OMA MEM).  LEMONADE assumes
   that the LEMONADE profile bis can be used as basis for an OMA
   technical specification of a realization based on LEMONADE of the OMA
   MEM enabler.

2.  LEMONADE Profile

   LEMONADE profile bis incorporates normatively the LEMONADE profile
   [4].

   <Editor's note: The LEMONADE profile is currently included by
   reference.  As it stabilizes as RFC, the text will be explicitly
   included and changes to the text will be explicitly made inline.>

3.  OMA MEM Requirement document

   The OMA MEM activity has collected a set of use cases and derived
   requirements for a mobile email enabler (MEM). the resulting work is
   summarized in OMA MEM Requirement document [3].  Some requirements
   relates to email protocols, some involve other OMA technologies
   outside the scope of IETF and some relate to implementations and
   normative interoperability statements for clients and servers.

4.  OMA MEM Architecture

   The OMA MEM activity has derived a logical architecture from the
   requirements and use cases described in [3].  The logical
   architecture, its elements and interfaces and the notations that it
   uses can be found in [2].

5.  OMA MEM Deployment Issues

   The OMA MEM Architecture document [2] further identifies deployment
   models.

   Certain of these deployment models are not what IETF has
   conventionally modeled.  They require special attention to end-to-end
   security aspects and may warrant introduction of additional security
   measures (e.g. object level encryption).

6.  OMA MEM proxy

   The OMA MEM Architecture document [2] identifies OMA MEM server
   proxies as server components that may be deployed ahead of firewalls
   to facilitate traversal of firewalls.

   Both IMAP and SMTP generally are compatible with proxies between the
   client and the server.  Such proxies may disrupt end-to-end
   encryption, with the transport-level encryption ending at the proxy
   and re-generating from the proxy to the server.  Again this may
   require additional security measures like object level encryption.

7.  IETF LEMONADE Architecture

   This section gives a brief introduction to the LEMONADE Architecture.

   The IETF LEMONADE activity has derived a LEMONADE profile [4] with
   the logical architecture represented in Figure 1, where arrows
   indicate content flows.

   Figure 1: LEMONADE logical architecture

   The LEMONADE profile bis assumes:

   o  IMAP protocol [5] including LEMONADE profile extensions [4]

   o  SUBMIT protocol (SMTP [7], ...) including LEMONADE profile
      extensions

   o  LEMONADE profile compliant IMAP store connected to MTA (Mail
      Transfer Agent) via ESMTP [6]

   o  LEMONADE profile compliant Submit server connected to MTA via
      ESMTP

   o  Lemonade profile ptotocols between message store and submit server
      (URLAUTH) (see [4]).

   o  Outband server to client notifications relying on external
      notification mechanisms (and notification protocols) that may be
      out of scope of the LEMONADE profile bis.

   o  A LEMONADE aware MUA (Mail User Agent).  While use of outband
      notification is described in the LEMONADE profile bis, support for
      the underlying notifications mechanisms/protocols is out of scope
      of the LEMONADE specifications.

   Further details on the IETF email protocol stack and architecture can
   be found in [8]

   Note that in Figure 1 the IMAP server and Submit server are
   represented connected to MTAs (Mail Transfer Agents) via ESMTP [6].
   This is not really essential.  It could as well be X.400 so long as
   the message in the store is in the internet form.

   OMA MEM identifies other functionalities.  These are considered as
   out of scope of the LEMONADE work and will need to be specified by
   OMA MEM.

   Figure 2: Mapping of LEMONADE profile bis logical architecture  onto

   As described in Section 7, the LEMONADE profile bis assumes LEMONADE
   profile bis compliant IMAP stores and Submit servers.  Because the

Internet-Draft            LEMONADE profile bis              January 2006


   LEMONADE profile bis extends the IMAP store and the submit server,
   the mobile enablement of email provided by the LEMONADE profile bis
   is directly provided in these server.  Mapped to OMA MEM logical
   architecture, for the case considered and specified by the LEMONADE
   profile bis, the MEM server and email server logically combined.
   They are however split into distinct LEMONADE message store and
   LEMONADE submit server.  The OMA MEM interfaces ME-2 ([2]) consists
   of two interfaces ME-2a and ME-2b associated respectively to IMAP
   extended according to the LEMONADE profile bis and SUBMIT extended
   according to the LEMONADE profile bis.

   The MUA is part of the MEM client.

   External notifications mechanism can be part of the other OMA enabler
   specified by OMA (or other activities).

8.2.  LEMONADE realization of OMA MEM with non-LEMONADE compliant
      servers

   The OMA MEM activity is not limited to enabling Lemonade compliant
   servers.  It explicitly identifies the need to support other
   backends.

8.2.1.  LEMONADE realization of OMA MEM with non-LEMONADE enhanced IMAP
        servers

   Figure 3 illustrates the case of IMAP servers that are not (yet)
   LEMONADE compliant / enhanced with LEMONADE.  In such case, the I2
   interface between the MEM server components and the IMAP store and
   submit server are IMAP and SUBMIT.

9.  Filters and server to client notifications and LEMONADE

   OMA MEM RD [3] and AD [2] emphasize the need to provide mechanisms
   for server to client notifications of email events and filtering.
   Figure 5 illustrates how notification and filterings are introduced
   in LEMONADE profile bis.

   Figure 5: Filtering mechanism defined in LEMONADE architecture

   In Figure 5, four categories of filters are defined:

   o  AF: Administrative Filters - Set up by email service provider.  AF
      are typically not configured by the user and set to apply policies
      content filtering, virus protection, spam filtering etc...

   o  DF: Deposit Filters - Filters that are executed on deposit of new
      emails.  They can be defined as SIEVE filters [9].  They can
      include vacation notices.

   o  VF: View Filters - Filters that define which emails are visible to
      the MUA.  View filters can be defined as virtual folders [10] as
      described in [10] and [23].

Internet-Draft            LEMONADE profile bis              January 2006


   o  NF: Notification Filters - Filters that define for what email
      server event an outband notification is sent to the client.

   The filters are manageable from the MUA:

   o  NF and DF: via SIEVE management protocol <Editor's note: Still to
      be defined>

   o  VF: via virtual folder mechanisms as discussed in [10] and [23]

10.  LEMONADE Profile bis features

   <Editor's note: The LEMONADE profile bis features will be detailed in
   this section (except for changes that affect inline the the LEMONADE
   profile [4] - these will be made inline in the original LEMONADE
   profile [4] text (See Section 2).>

   The LEMONADE Profile bis provides normative support for the technical
   features identified within scope of IETF LEMONADE work in the OMA MEM
   realization internet draft [21].

   <Editor's note: This text will be updated when all features are
   appropriately addressed. [21] will be maintained as a working
   document to remain synchronized with the LEMONADE prfile bis to
   ensure supporting all committed aspects.>

   The following is a list of features that will be normatively
   described: <Editor's note: The features are currently introduced by
   reference to documents that are work in progress and may still be
   individual drafts.  They are expected to become WG drafts and RFCs.
   References will be updated and text provided to explain the normative
   usage in LEMONADE profile bis.>

   o  LEMONADE profile [4] features, evolved to include capabilities to
      edit on MUA and send differences to server even for address
      fields..

   o  Notifications (server to client) as discussed in [23].

   o  Filters as discussed in [23], [10], [9] and [22].  Events that can
      be bound to notifications are described in [13].  Filter remote
      management are discussed in [23], [10] and [26]

   o  Virtual folders as discussed in [10]

   o  Media conversion as discussed in [15].  Streamed media conversion
      is still under consideration.

   o  Quick reconnect as discussed in [17]

   o  Compression as discussed in [24]

   o  Intermediaries as discussed in [20] to become a best practice
      document (draft-ietf-lemonade-deployments).  It is also addressed
      by informational track draft [18]

   o  Object level encryption and Proxies are still under discussion.
      We await proposals.  An example of object level encryption is

      provided in [25] as XENCRYPT. [23] further discusses the use for
      notification encryption.

   o  Message recall within SUBMIT domain.

11.  Security considerations

   This specification provides no security measures beyond those in the
   referenced Internet Mail and LEMONADE documents.

   We note however the security risks associated to:

   o  Outband notifications

   o  Server configuration by client

   o  Client configuration by server

   o  Presence of proxy servers

   o  Presence of servers as intermediaries

   o  In general the deployment models considered by OMA MEM that are
      not conventional IETF deployment models.

   o  Measures to address the need to traverse firewalls and mobile
      network intermediaries.

12.  IANA considerations

   No specific IANA considerations have been identified yet that are not
   covered by the different drafts and RFCs included in the realization
   described in this document.

13.  Future work

   The different drafts and RFCs referenced in this document must be
   completed.  Some require initial proposals (e.g. object level
   encryption, proxies, recall and conversion of streamed media).

   Text will be updated as described in editor's notes
