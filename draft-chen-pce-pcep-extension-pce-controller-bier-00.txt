1.  Introduction

   [RFC8283]introduces the architecture for PCE as a central controller
   as an extension of the architecture described in[RFC4655] and assumes
   the continued use of PCEP as the protocol used between PCE and PCC.
   [RFC8283]further examines the motivations and applicability for PCEP
   as a Southbound Interface (SBI), and introduces the implications for
   the protocol.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller]specify the
   procedures and PCEP protocol extensions for using the PCE as the
   central controller for static LSPs, where LSPs can be provisioned as
   explicit label instructions at each hop on the end-to-end path.  Each
   router along the path must be told what label-forwarding instructions
   to program and what resources to reserve.  The PCE-based controller
   keeps a view of the network and determines the paths of the end-to-
   end LSPs, and the controller uses PCEP to communicate with each
   router along the path of the end-to-end LSP.

Internet-Draft                 PCECC BIER                 September 2020


   [RFC8279] defines a Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER)
   architecture where all intended multicast receivers are encoded as a
   bitmask in the multicast packet header within different
   encapsulations such as described in [RFC8296].  A router that
   receives such a packet will forward the packet based on the bit
   position in the packet header towards the receiver(s) following a
   precomputed tree for each of the bits in the packet.  Each receiver
   is represented by a unique bit in the bitmask.

   This document specifies the procedures and PCEP protocol extensions
   when a PCE-based controller is also responsible for configuring the
   forwarding actions on the routers (BIER information distribution in
   this case).

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119.

3.  PCECC BIER Requirements

   Following key requirements for PCECC-BIER should be considered
   when`designing the PCECC based solution:

   o  PCEP speaker supporting this draft needs to have the capability to
      advertise its PCECC-BIER capability to its peers.

   o  PCEP speaker not supporting this draft needs to be able to reject
      PCECC-BIER related message with a reason code that indicates no
      support for PCECC.

   o  PCEP procedures needs to provide a means to update (or cleanup)
      the BIER related informations (BIER subdomain-id, BFR-id and BSL
      etc) to the PCC.

   o  PCEP procedures needs to provide a means to synchronize the BIER
      related informations (BIER subdomain-id, BFR-id and BSL etc)
      between PCE to PCC in the PCEP messages.

4.  Procedures for Using the PCE as the Central Controller (PCECC) in
    BIER

4.1.  Stateful PCE Model

   Active stateful PCE is described in [RFC8231].  PCE as a central
   controller (PCECC) reuses existing Active stateful PCE mechanism as
   much as possible to control the LSP.

4.2.  New Functions

   This document uses the same PCEP messages and its extensions which
   are described in [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller]for
   PCECC-BIER as well.

   PCEP messages PCRpt, PCInitiate, PCUpd are also used to send LSP
   Reports, LSP setup and LSP update respectively.  The extended
   PCInitiate message described in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] is used to download
   or cleanup central controller's instructions (CCIs) (BIER related
   informations in scope of this document).  The extended PCRpt message
   described in [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] is also
   used to report the CCIs (BIER related informations) from PCC to PCE.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller]specify an object
   called CCI for the encoding of central controller's instructions.This
   document extends the CCI by defining another object-type for BIER.

4.3.  PCECC Capability Advertisement

   During PCEP Initialization Phase, PCEP Speakers (PCE or PCC)
   advertise their support of PCECC extensions.  A PCEP Speaker includes
   the "PCECC Capability" sub-TLV, described in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller].

   This document adds B-bit in PCECC-CAPABILITY sub-TLV for BIER.

4.4.  BIER Path Operations

   The PCEP messages pertaining to PCECC-BIER MUST include PATH-SETUP-
   TYPE TLV [RFC8408] with PST=TBD in the SRP object to clearly identify
   the PCECC-BIER LSP is intended.

4.4.1.  PCECC Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER)

   BIER as described in [RFC8402] defines an architecture where all
   intended multicast receivers are encoded as a bitmask in the
   multicast packet header within different encapsulations such as
   described in [RFC8296].

   [RFC8401] defines IS-IS extensions to distribute the BIER
   information(BIER subdomain-id, BFR-id and BSL etc).This document
   proposes a new mechanism where PCE allocates centrally and uses PCEP
   to advertise the BIER information(BIER subdomain-id, BFR-id and BSL
   etc).  In some deployments PCE (and PCEP) are better suited than IGP
   because of centralized nature of PCE and direct TCP based PCEP
   session to the node.

4.4.1.1.  PCECC BIER information allocation

   Each node (PCC) is allocated BIER information by the PCECC.The BIER
   information mainly includes BIER subdomain-id, BFR-id, BSL, BFR
   prefix, BSL, Encapsulation Type, BIFT ID,Max SI and BFR nexthop.

   The PCECC allocate the BIER subdomain-id, BFR-id , BFR prefix, BSL,
   Encapsulation Type, BIFT ID, and Max SI to the PCC, On receiving the
   BIER information allocation, each node (PCC) uses IGP protocol to
   distribute BIER related information to other nodes.  The node
   calculate the nexthop.

4.4.1.2.  Redundant PCEs

   [I-D.litkowski-pce-state-sync] describes synchronization mechanism
   between the stateful PCEs.  The BIER informations allocated by a PCE
   MUST also be synchronized among PCEs for PCECC BIER state
   synchronization.

4.4.1.3.  Re Delegation and Cleanup

   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] describes the action
   needed for CCIs for the Basic PCECC LSP on this terminated
   session.Similarly actions should be applied for the BIER information
   as well.

4.4.1.4.  Synchronization of BIER information Allocations

   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller]describes the
   synchronization of Central Controller's Instructions (CCI) via LSP
   state synchronization as described in [RFC8231] and [RFC8232].Same
   procedures should be applied for BIER information as well.

4.5.  PCEP messages

4.5.1.  The OPEN Object

4.5.1.1.  PCECC Capability sub-TLV

   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller] defined the
   PCECCCAPABILITY TLV.  A new B-bit is defined in PCECC-CAPABILITY sub-
   TLV for PCECC-BIER:

   indicates that the PCEP speaker is capable for PCECC-BIER capability
   and PCE would allocate BIER information on this session.

4.5.2.  PATH-SETUP-TYPE TLV

   The PATH-SETUP-TYPE TLV is defined in [RFC8408].  PST = TBD is used
   when Path is setup via PCECC BIER mode.On a PCRpt/PCUpd/PCInitiate
   message, the PST=TBD indicates that this path was setup via a PCECC-
   BIER based mechanism where either the BIER informations were
   allocated/instructed by PCE via PCECC mechanism.

   defines another object-type for BIER purpose.
