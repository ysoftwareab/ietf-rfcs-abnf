Abstract

   This document defines a packet, message, and address TLV, named
   MANET_ID.  The MANET_ID TLV can be used to specify a administratively
   configured MANET region for which the related piece of information is
   intended.

Internet-Draft                  MANET-ID                       July 2007


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies a TLV structure named MANET_ID for the
   generalize packet/message format [I-D.ietf-manet-packetbb].  This TLV
   is used to tag information as belonging to an administratively
   configured MANET region.  The TLV can be attached to a packet,
   message, or address.


2.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Additionally, this document uses terminology from
   [I-D.ietf-manet-packetbb].


3.  MANET_ID TLV Structure

   A MANET_ID TLV may be a packet, message, or address TLV.  If the
   MANET_ID TLV is attached a packet or message, then it must be a
   single value TLV as defined in [I-D.ietf-manet-packetbb].

   The <value> of the MANET_ID TLV is a integer value.  The maximum
   length is 64-bits (8-bytes).


4.  Protocol Recommendations

   This document recommends specific protocol instance behavior based on
   the existence of the MANET_ID TLV.

   A protocol instance processing a packet, message, or address with
   MANET_ID TLVs should be administratively configured to participate in
   a network region identified by a particular MANET_ID value.

   Participation in multiple regions is allowed, but the behavior is not
   specified in this document.  If a protocol instance does participate
   in multiple MANET_ID regions (or both tagged and untagged
   information), it SHOULD maintain the MANET_ID attached to any stored
   information.

   Upon evaluating a particular piece of information, a protocol
   instance SHOULD ignore information tagged with a MANET_ID TLV that
   contains a MANET_ID different from their own configured values.

4.1.  MANET_ID Configuration

   Protocol instance configuration of MANET_ID should be
   administratively configured.  WARNING: Improper assignment of
   MANET_ID can result in improper processing and distribution of tagged
   information.

4.2.  Transmitting Information

   The behavior of a protocol instance to transmit information as tagged
   or untagged SHOULD be administratively configured.  Network designers
   should decide whether transmitting untagged information will result
   in improper behavior.

4.3.  Processing Untagged Information

   The processing behavior of a protocol instance to untagged
   information SHOULD be administratively configured.  Network designers
   should decide whether processing of untagged information can result
   in improper behavior.


5.  IANA Considerations

                              TLV Assignments

               +----------+----------+---------------------+
               | Mnemonic | TLV Type | Assigned Type Value |
               +----------+----------+---------------------+
               | MANET_ID |  Packet  |         TBD1        |
               | MANET_ID |  Message |         TBD2        |
               | MANET_ID |  Address |         TBD3        |
