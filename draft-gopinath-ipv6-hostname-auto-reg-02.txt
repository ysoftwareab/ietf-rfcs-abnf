     Abstract 
         
        This document describes a new method, which will automatically 
        acquire the host name of active IPv6 nodes and register it to the 
        local Domain Name System (DNS) server. Active IPv6 nodes are nodes 
        that are connected to a network. 
         
        Our proposed new method [6] will automatically learn some useful 
        information from all the IPv6 nodes, such as the host name and the 
        IP address. The Agent using a new method will keep all the 
        information that is send by the nodes. The Resolver will add the 
        host name together with the IPv6 address to the DNS. This will be 
        implemented without the need for any changes at the clients' site.  
         
        The objective of this document is to specify a new procedure and 
        also the algorithm used in the procedure.

     1. Introduction 
         
        Domain Name System has long been used for resolving host name to IP 
        address and vice versa.  The need of automatically sensing the host 
        name and IP addresses on a network by DNS does not arise because 
        IPv4 addresses are easy to remember. The improvement of DNS with the 
        introduction of DNSv6 should have included this new feature so that 
        it would be an intelligent application. 
         
        The reason for the proposed method and the solutions are as follows. 
         
        1.  The main factor that drives us to introduce this procedure is 
            the IPv6 addressing scheme. 128 bits IPv6 address is indeed very 
            long to remember compared to IPv4. This hexadecimal 
            representation makes unit of network difficult to be identified 
            and remembered based on this IP address. Instead of remembering 
            oneÆs IP address, it will be easier for us to just use the host 
            name.

     Internet Draft     IPv6 auto-registration procedure     3 December, 2002 
      
      
         
            To solve this problem, a new registration procedure that will 
            automatically sense all the IPv6 nodes on a specific link and 
            add all the names of the nodes within that domain to its DNS. 
            This will also give the users the freedom to choose their own 
            host name for their node/s. An algorithm will be used to make 
            sure that the host name is unique within the domain. 
         
        2.  Maintenance of these addresses is another hassle for system 
            administrator. In current DNS, system administrators manually 
            enter the host name and the IP address associated with it into 
            the host name file or the DNS. Whenever there is a change to a 
            node in the domain, system administrator must manually edit the 
            host name file to make sure that the new nodeÆs information is 
            updated to the list.  
         
            To solve the above-mentioned problem, the new procedure will 
            periodically check and update the nodesÆ information into the 
            host name file, if there are changes to the nodes. Even though 
            we can use dynamic update [8] to send updated information to the 
            DNS, this is restricted to certain operating system that 
            implements the dynamic update.   
         
        By using this procedure, cost of handling and maintaining the host 
        names can be reduced in huge amount. The amounts of time spend by 
        system administrator on setting up the host names will also be 
        reduced.  
         
        This document proposes a new procedure to dynamically handle the 
        host names on an IPv6 LAN, which is named IPv6 Hostname DNS auto-
        registration procedure. This document also describes the algorithm 
        used in the new procedure.  
         
        The implementation of this procedure involves few existing methods. 
        For example, to get the nodes information, the use of Neighbor 
        solicitation (Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) packet) and also the 
        ICMPv6 packet will be implemented. This new procedure supports all 
        types of IPv6 addresses available, both the stateless [1] and 
        statefull IPv6 addresses. This includes link local addresses, site 
        local addresses and global unicast addresses. 
      
      
     2. Study on existing and similar application [6] 
         
        The dynamic naming of host name was not implemented in IPv4 because 
        IPv4 are easy to remember compared to IPv6 addresses. The only 
        similar proposed method was discussed in a draft titled Domain Name 
        Auto-Registration for plugged in IPv6 [3].

     Internet Draft     IPv6 auto-registration procedure     3 December, 2002 
      
      
     2.1 Domain Name Auto-Registration for plugged in IPv6 
         <draft-kitamura-ipv6-name-auto-reg-00.txt> 
         
        This draft has proposed to use a method for domain name auto-
        registration for plugged in IPv6 nodes. The method is divided into 2 
        functions, which are ôdetectorö function and ôregistrarö function. 
        The ôdetectorö is used to detect the appearance of new IPv6 nodes 
        and send it to a ôRegistrarö. The ôRegistrarö is used to prepare 
        appropriate domain name information for registration and to register 
        it by sending dynamic update messages to the corresponding request.  
         
        Two approaches are used in the draft to detect the nodes. One of the 
        methods is by detecting the DAD packets. The other approach is by 
        using the SNMP procedure. The setback of this method is that it 
        needs to be implemented at both the client and the server site. A 
        new Internet standard like ICMP needs to be set for this approach to 
        work.  
          
        Our proposed protocol is similar to the above draft except that our 
        protocol uses the DAD together with the ICMPv6 packet to get the 
        host name.  
         
        Some of the idea discussed in this approach can be shared to produce 
        a better method and algorithm. 
         
      
     3. Design of the new auto-registration procedure 
         
        This section describes the design of the new procedure, IPv6 
        Hostname auto-registration procedure [9]. The algorithm used in this 
        procedure to solve the above mentioned problems would also be 
        discussed in this section.  
      
     3.1 Design Issue 
         
        The new auto-registration procedure can be incorporated into the 
        existing DNS. There are few issues involved in designing this 
        procedure.  
         
        1.  Assignment of multiple IPv6 addresses to a single interface 
            makes names assignment a complex problem. Each IPv6 active nodes 
            is capable of having multiple IP addresses that may have 
            different reachability scope (link local, site local or global). 
            It can get the IPv6 address using both stateless and statefull 
            configuration method. The IPv6 nodes will have a default link 
            local address, which is configured automatically using the 
            autoconfiguration method [1]. Each node would also be able to 
            construct itÆs own global address using the prefix advertised by 
            a router on the same link. Beside that we can also manually 
            assign a global IPv6 address to that same interface.  So, we

     Internet Draft     IPv6 auto-registration procedure     3 December, 2002 
      
      
            must make sure that all the addresses point to the same host 
            name, unless the system administrator wants to configure each IP 
            addresses with different host names. To select an address that 
            will bind to the host name, default address selection can be 
            used [10]. The default address selection is a method to select a 
            source address or a destination address from multiple addresses 
            that is assigned to a single interface.  
         
        2.  The implementation of a new method usually requires a lot of 
            changes at both the server and the client. To minimize the 
            changes on nodes, the new proposed procedureÆs implementation 
            required the development at only one site. This is implemented 
            using the existing methods available, which supports all 
            operating systems. Some of the methods developed uses the ICMPv6 
            and the neighbor discovery in IPv6. This will not only reduce 
            the impact of introducing new protocol in the Internet but also 
            make the implementation of new system much easier.  
      
        3.  The locations of the entities on the network need to be decided. 
            This is to make sure that optimum results can be achieved. If a 
            DNS is shared between 2 LANs, the entities must be implemented 
            so that it can detect all the nodes in both the LANs. This is 
            because the DAD and the ICMPv6 packets used for detection of the 
            nodes wonÆt be able to pass through the router that separates 
            the LANs. 
         
     3.2 Design Method 
         
        Hostname auto-registration procedure is composed of 2 entities, the 
        Agent, which detects all the IPv6 nodes on a link and the Resolver, 
        which updates the DNS with the latest host name information received 
        from the Agent/s.

        Figure 1 shows the overall architecture of the new procedure and the 
        communication between the two entities. The Agent resides on a 
        router while the Resolver is placed together with the DNS. The Agent 
        sends the information it captures to the Resolver using the 
        communication pipe between the two entities.  
         
         
     3.2.1 The Agent 
         
        The AgentÆs function is to detect all the nodes on a link and keep 
        the information in a specific file. It uses two detection methods 
        for getting the information from a node. The methods are using the 
        DAD packet and the ICMPv6 packet. The detection of DAD packets is 
        restricted on a single LAN because the router wonÆt allow the DAD 
        packets to pass through. So, the Agent must be placed on all the 
        LANs in order to detect the DAD packets issued by the nodes. The 
        best location for the Agent to be placed is with the router.  
         
        The Agent need to be manually configured first so that the 
        information that it detects from the IPv6 nodes can be send to the 
        Resolver to be updated into the DNS. It will also do periodic 
        checking on the LAN to make sure that new changes to the nodes are 
        updated to the DNS.  
         
      
      
     3.2.2 The Resolver 
         
        This entity sets an appropriate host name for registration into the 
        corresponding DNS server. The host name is created from the 
        information that is sent by the Agent. It later updates the host 
        name into the DNS.  
         
        The Resolver must have a method to verify the uniqueness of the host 
        name in the network. This is achieved by using the naming algorithm 
        to name the nodes. This algorithm is also used to minimize the 
        effects of misconfigured registration request by the nodes. All the 
        names given by the Agent is kept in a specific file. This is to make 
        sure that the information can be retrieved easily whenever 
        necessary. 
         
        The Resolver must be configured so that it directly updates the 
        nodesÆ information to the DNS. 
      
     Gopinath, Ettikan            3 June 2003                        [Page 6]

        The main file in the Resolver consists of all the information send 
        by the Agents. After updating the file, it will be copied by the 
        Agent for their reference. This is important because a same node 
        will move from one subnet to another subnet with same information. 
        This scenario is further described in the next section.   
         
        In order to make the Resolver to work effectively, it must be placed 
        together with the DNS. This will make sure that the information is 
        updated as soon as the Resolver received it from the Agent. 
      
      
     3.2.3            Agent-Resolver Communication 
      
        All the Agents, which communicate to the same Resolver, will have a 
        copy of the updated database from the Resolver. This database will 
        be used to check if changes occur to a node as described below. 
         
        The link local address of each machine will be added in a new file. 
        This address will be bind together with the global address and the 
        host name of the machine in the file. The link local address can be 
        used to check the uniqueness of the machine because the link local 
        address is unique as it is generated using the Ethernet address and 
        it never changes wherever the node moves. This information will be 
        compared every time the Agent receives the updated information from 
        a node before the host name is updated to the DNS via the Resolver.  
         
        In the development of the Agent and the Resolver, multi-link 
        scenario needs to be taken into consideration. It is a situation 
        where a node moves from one subnet to another subnet and uses a same 
        DNS. It is possible for few scenarios to happen when a node moves 
        from one subnet to another and when some changes happened to a node.   
               
          1. A node uses new IP address but same host name and NIC card.  
           
             This is a complicated scenario. In this case, the link local 
             address together with the new global address will be compared 
             with the information in the AgentÆs database. Since the link 
             local address is still in the database, the old global address 
             associated with the link local address will be deleted from the 
             Resolver. The new global address will be updated to the 
             database. With this algorithm we can maintain the host name and 
             at the same time change the global address.  
      
          2. A node uses new IP address using new NIC card but same host 
             name 
         
             This is same as two nodes asking the same host name. In this 
             situation, the naming algorithm will give a new name for the

     Internet Draft     IPv6 auto-registration procedure     3 December, 2002 
      
      
             node. The old data will be overwritten after some time depends 
             on system administrator (see section (g)). Until then the node 
             has to use a new name generated using the naming algorithm or 
             change the host name. This can be overcome if system 
             administrator manually deletes the old information. The same 
             host name cannot be used to avoid multiple updates by a node 
             that uses the same name. This will be a hassle because every 
             time a new node with same name activated, it will overwrite the 
             old IP address. With this, some of the host name will be 
             missing from the list. 
      
          3. A node changes both host name and IP address replacing old 
             information 
              
             The new information will be compared with the information in 
             the file.  First the algorithm will check the link local 
             address in the file. Since the link local address is already in 
             the file, the global and the host name will be compared. If 
             both the information is new, then the old will data be over 
             written with the new information. The Agent will send this 
             updated information to the Resolver. The Resolver will then 
             update the new information of the node to the DNS.  
           
          4. A node uses a new NIC card with old IP address and Host Name  
              
             First the link local address will be compared with link local 
             address in the file. If there is no entry, then the link local 
             address will be entered and the host name will be compared with 
             the list. If the host name is already exist, then a new name 
             will be generated. If not, the host name will be entered 
             together with the link local address and global IP address. 
      
          5. A node uses new NIC and Host Name but old IP address 
              
             This is similar to scenario (4) above.  
              
          6. A node changes the host name but uses the same IP address 
           
             The link local address of the specific node will be compared 
             with the link local addresses in the file. If the IP address is 
             already in the file, then the global IP address will be 
             compared. If there is no change, then the host name will be 
             compared. The new host name will overwrite the existing host 
             name in the file before updating it in the DNS.

     Internet Draft     IPv6 auto-registration procedure     3 December, 2002 
      
      
          7. A node is inactive for certain duration 
           
             This is a case when a node doesnÆt response to AgentÆs query. 
             This scenario is possible when a node is crashed or not booted 
             by the owner for some time. The Agent will check the node for 3 
             or 4 months (depends on the setting. If the node is still 
             inactive after the duration, the information will be 
             overwritten by new a node requesting for the same name. If the 
             owner wants to keep the information after that time period, 
             system administrator need to set a flag in the DNS indicating 
             not to delete the nodeÆs information. This flag can be set as 
             an additional field in the DNS or in the Resolver.  
              
          8. Two or more nodes request for the same host name 
           
             Using the naming algorithm (section 3.4.1 & 3.4.2), the nodes 
             will be given the name requested using first come first serve 
             basis. When the nodes rebooted, the names will be maintained as 
             given earlier.  
      
      
     3.3 Detection Method 
         
        This is the main method in the new procedure. In this method, the 
        Agent will detect any new IPv6 nodes on a link, check the uniqueness 
        of that node on that link and then update the information in the 
        DNS.  
         
        There are 2 kinds of detection method used in the procedure. Both 
        the detection methods enable a mechanism to work without the 
        introduction of a new protocol and without any functions installed 
        into the IPv6 nodes. This two methods need to be combined to make 
        sure that the nodes are configured correctly with the host name in 
        the DNS.  
         
        1.  Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) 
         
            The nodes can be detected by monitoring the duplicate address 
            detection (DAD) packet issued by nodes that has been activated. 
            The DAD packet is issued as part of neighbor solicitation in 
            neighbor discovery [2]. The implementation of duplicate address 
            detection is compulsory on all IPv6 nodes, regardless of whether 
            they are obtained through stateful, stateless or manual 
            configuration. DAD has the same functions as the ARP packet in 
            IPv4 but DAD provides more information. It is issued to ensure 
            that all configured addresses are likely to be unique on a given 
            link [1].  
         
      
     Gopinath, Ettikan            3 June 2003                        [Page 9] 
      
      

      
     Internet Draft     IPv6 auto-registration procedure     3 December, 2002 
      
      
            By monitoring the DAD packets on a link, the Agent will capture 
            it and the packets will be analyzed. Then using ICMPv6 packet, 
            the Agent will issue a query to that node for more information 
            (see section 2 of 3.3). All the information that has been 
            captured will be kept in a specific file for reference and send 
            to the Resolver. It should be noted that the DAD packets could 
            only be detected on a link-local, thus the Agent must be 
            positioned on a specific location to detect the packets (see 
            section 3.4). 
         
         
        2.  ICMPv6 û node information query and node information reply  
         
            This is the most important part in the Agent. ICMPv6 type that 
            will be in the Agent are node information (NI) query and node 
            information reply. The use of ICMPv6 NI query as type 139 and 
            ICMPv6 NI reply type 140 is already defined in [4]. Currently 
            the ICMPv6 packet type for querying nodes information is still 
            in the process of upgrading. Node information query and node 
            information reply are information-based messages. NI query 
            packet is sent by the ôQuerierö node to ask some information 
            from the ôResponderö node. The ôResponderö node, upon receiving 
            the ICMPv6 NI query packet, replies to the querier with the 
            information requested by the ôQuerierö node.  
         
            This will be an exact method that will be used by the Agent to 
            query IPv6 nodes on a link. The ICMPv6 packet can be addressed 
            to a unicast address, a link local multicast address or an 
            anycast address depending on the scope of the information 
            required. In this implementation we will skip the use of anycast 
            and only use the unicast and the multicast address for querying 
            information.   
         
            The ICMP source address should be that of the address where the 
            Agent reside. This is to make sure that the reply is send back 
            to the Agent. The destination address can be chosen from the 2 
            types of addresses according to the algorithm. There will be 2 
            scenarios for choosing the destination address: 
         
            i)   If a node has been detected by capturing the DAD packet, 
                then the destination address will be the unicast address of 
                the detected node. After getting the IPv6 address from the 
                DAD packet, the Agent will use it as a destination address 
                in the ICMPv6 NI query requesting for host name (type 2 for 
                qtype field in the ICMPv6 NI query).  
         
            ii)  The Agent uses the predefined link local multicast address, 
                which is FF02::1 as the destination address to do periodic 
                checking on a link to detect any changes or updates to a 
                node. This query need to be sent from time to time so that

                the changes can be detected earlier to make the new 
                procedure efficient. The frequency of sending this type of 
                packets will also need to be considered. Even though the 
                ICMPv6 packets send are small, if it is send too frequent, 
                it might flood the network.  For it to work efficiently the 
                internal time taken for sending the ICMPv6 packet need to be 
                acceptable.  
         
            The content of qtype in the ICMPv6 packet that will be used by 
            the Agent is either type 2 (DNS names) or 3 (Node Addresses) and 
            the implementation of the Agent is done with an assumption that 
            all the nodes are configured with the latest ICMPv6, which 
            implements the ICMPv6 node information query. Upon receiving an 
            ICMPv6 NI query, the nodes must check the queryÆs IPv6 
            destination address and discard it if it is not intended for the 
            node. The destination address of the query should be either the 
            IP address of the receiving node or the multicast address that 
            the receiving node joined earlier. The use of these ICMPv6 type 
            is described is detail in the IPv6 Node Information Queries 
            draft [4]. 
             
             
     3.3.1 Detecting the nodes 
         
        The Agents continuously monitor for DAD packets in the network. The 
        DAD packets that it captures will be analyzed. It will compare IP 
        address with the information in the database the Agent copied from 
        the Resolver. If the IP address is already exists in the database, 
        the Agent will further query the host name of the node. If there is 
        no information in the database, the Agent will further query the 
        node using the ICMPv6 packet. After getting the necessary 
        information, the Agent will pass the information to the Resolver.

     packet 
         
        The Agent sends unicast ICMPv6 query to a specific node requesting 
        more information about the node. If there is no reply from the node, 
        the Agent will request again. The Agent will kept requesting for few 
        times if there is no reply from the node. Once the node replied, the

        This algorithm is similar to unicast query. The different is the 
        target node/s is a multicast group. Once the Agent received the 
        reply from the node, it will queue the information and check in the 
        database copied from the Resolver. If there are changes, then the 
        Agent will send the updated data to the Resolver.

     3.4 Updating the DNS by the Resolver 
         
        The ResolverÆs function is to update the DNS with the information 
        received from the Agent/s. It will receive the information from the 
        Agent/s and will activate the naming algorithm before updating it to 
        the DNS. The Resolver must be configured to communicate with the DNS 
        server so that the information received will be automatically

     Internet Draft     IPv6 auto-registration procedure     3 December, 2002 
      
      
        updated. The naming algorithm is used to make sure that the names 
        are unique in link.  
      
      
     3.4.1 Naming 
         
        The unique feature of the auto-registration procedure is the naming 
        of the IPv6 nodes. The procedure allows the users to set their 
        preferable name for their IPv6 node/s. Even though we donÆt have the 
        control over the naming, the procedure still decides whether to use 
        the specific name given by each user to their nodes. System 
        administrator also has a choice to use this algorithm or manually 
        configure the names. He also can use both manual and the approach 
        described in this document.   
         
        The Resolver uses first come first serve basis in the naming 
        algorithm. If there is a conflict of names between 2 IPv6 nodes, the 
        node that registered first will be given the name. For the second 
        node, a new name will be generated using the name given by the node. 
        For example if the conflict name is ôipv6-dnsö, then the algorithm 
        will assign a new name for the second node based on that conflict 
        name such as ôipv6-dns-2ö. In this way the each node will still have 
        a unique name. 
          
        The technique used in this draft is different from the approach 
        documented in ôDomain Name Auto-Registration for Plugged-in IPv6 
        Nodesö [3]. In that approach, the naming is still handled by system 
        administrator and no freedom given to each user. The second 
        approach, in that draft, uses predefined name, which the registrar 
        randomly generates. He also uses a method to detect the names 
        automatically but in the method described, all the nodes must define 
        a special MIB. This is difficult because it involve both the server 
        and the client (nodes). 
         
        To make the process simpler, we only use 2 ways for naming a node, 
        which is either configured by system administrator for fix host name 
        for an IPv6 node or use the name given by the node.  
         
        Another important issue is the format of the naming. Before passing 
        the information captured to the Resolver, the Agent should check if 
        host name is in a valid format. If it is not, then the information 
        given by a node will be dropped. This is to ensure that weird names 
        are not registered into DNS.  
      
      
     3.4.2 Naming algorithm 
         
        The Resolver first checks the IP address given by the Agent with the 
        IP address in its database. If the IP address is new, the Resolver 
        checks if the name given by the node exists in the database. If not,

        the IP address together with the host name will be registered into 
        DNS. If the name is already exists, the Resolver will generate a 
        similar name for the node as mentioned in the previous section.  
      
      
        BEGIN 
          1. RESOLVER COMPARES THE HOST NAME FILE GIVEN BY THE  AGENT WITH 
          THE ITÆS FILE 
               IF IP ADDRESS IS NEW 
                    GOTO STEP 2 
               ELSE GOTO STEP 3 
          2. CHECK IF NAME IS NEW 
               IF NAME IS NEW 
                    GOTO STEP 4 
               ELSE GOTO 5 
          3. COMPARE THE NAME IN THE FILE THAT IS ATTACHED TO THE IP ADDRESS 
               IF IT IS NOT SAME  
                    GOTO STEP 5 
               ELSE END 
          4. UPDATE IP AND NAME TO THE DNS 
               END 
          5. GENERATE A NEW SIMILAR NAME 
               GOTO STEP 4 
        END 
      
      
      
     3.5 Location of the Agent and the Resolver in a network 
         
        Since the Agent must be placed to detect the appearance of IPv6 
        nodes, the location of the Agent is very much restricted.  
         
        The best location for the Agent is to be placed together with the 
        router while the Resolver need to be placed with the DNS. Using this 
        method, each link will have an Agent, which is manually configured 
        to directly communicate with the Resolver. This kind of 
        configuration is needed for the Agent to capture the DAD packets 
        issued by the nodes. If the Agent is not installed in every link, 
        the DAD packets cannot be detected because the router will drop all 
        the DAD packets from going out of it.

        Figure 2 shows an example configuration of the entities on a single 
        LAN, with the DNS in the same subnet. In this case, the Agent will 
        directly communicate with the Resolver to update the host name file. 
        The Agent will dynamically get all the names and update the Resolver 
        from time to time. The Resolver will then update the DNS with this 
        latest information.

               Fig.3 Configuration on 2 different LANs sharing one DNS 
         
         
        Figure 3 shows the implementation where one DNS is shared among 
        nodes from different LANs. In this scenario, each LAN will have an 
        Agent that will communicate directly with the Resolver that resides 
        on a DNS. To avoid the conflict of names from different LAN, each 
        Agent will make a copy of host name files from the Resolver. In the 
        case of multiple Agents accessing the Resolver at the same time, the 
        procedure will allow the first Agent to update the changes to the 
        Resolver. It will be first come first server basis. In this case the 
        naming of nodes will be organized without the names conflicting with 
        other nodes from different LAN/s. 
      
      
      
     4. Conclusion 
         
        The implementation of the auto-registration procedure is aimed to 
        solve two major problems discussed above. In the future the 
        capability of this new procedure can be extended by adding more 
        functions and make it more secure in transmitting the data.  
      
      
     5. Security Consideration 
         
        Security is one of the main issues in developing this new procedure. 
        Since the Agent directly sends the information to the Resolver, the 
        information must be send securely. The other transmission that needs 
        to be handled securely is between the Resolver and the DNS.  
         
        It also must make sure that the message send by the Agent are from 
        the Agent that is registered with the Resolver. If not the data 
        should be ignored. This is to make sure that no malicious data being 
        send to the Resolver.  
         
        The security issue for this new technique needs to be discussed 
        further.
