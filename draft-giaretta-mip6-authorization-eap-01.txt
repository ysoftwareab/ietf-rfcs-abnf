   generic information items together with authentication data. This 
   approach has the advantage that the access equipment acts as a simple 
   pass-through for EAP messages and therefore does not play any active 
   role in the Mobile IPv6 negotiation procedure, which makes the 
   solution easier to deploy and maintain.

1. Introduction 
    
   Mobile IPv6 [1] requires that Mobile Nodes (MNs) and Home Agents 
   (HAs) share a set of configuration parameters: the MN must know its 
   Home Address, the Home Agent Address and the cryptographic material 
   needed to protect MIPv6 signaling (e.g. shared keys or certificates 
   to setup an IPsec security association). MIPv6 base protocol does not 
   specify any method to automatically acquire this information; which 
   means that network administrators are normally required to manually 
   set configuration data on MNs and HAs. 
    
   Manual configuration of Home Agents and Mobile Nodes also works as an 
   implicit method for Mobile IPv6 authorization, because only the users 
   that have been administratively enabled on a specific Home Agent are 
   allowed to exploit Mobile IPv6 and its features. 
    
   However, in a large network (e.g. the network of a mobile operator), 
   which may include millions of users and many Home Agents, the 
   operational and administrative burden of this procedure may easily 
   become overwhelming. In addition, the extensive use of manual and 
   static configurations limits the flexibility and reliability of the 
   system, in that it is not possible to dynamically assign the HA when

   the user enters the network, which would help to optimize performance 
   and resource utilization (e.g. assignment of the HA closest to the 
   MN's point of attachment). 
    
   This is generally referred as the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping problem. 
   As discussed in [2], several bootstrapping scenarios can be 
   identified depending on the relationship between the network operator 
   providing IP services to the MN (Access Service Provider, ASP) and 
   the service provider managing the HA (Mobility Service Provider, 
   MSP). This document describes a solution to the bootstrapping problem 
   that is applicable in a scenario where the ASP and the MSP are the 
   same provider (Integrated ASP, IASP). 
    
   The proposed solution performs dynamic Mobile IPv6 authorization and 
   configuration together with MN authentication for network access. 
   MIPv6 negotiation and bootstrapping is controlled by the AAA server 
   of the home provider (IASP), that interacts with the mobile node 
   relying on AAA routing and EAP, exploiting the capability of some EAP 
   methods (e.g. PEAPv2 [4], EAP-FAST [5]) to convey generic information 
   items together with authentication data.

   General mobility terminology can be found in [3]. The following 
   additional terms are used here: 
    
   ASP     Access Service Provider 
    
   IASP    Integrated Access Service Provider 
    
   MSP     Mobility Service Provider

3. Protocol Overview 
    
   The basic idea behind the solution proposed herewith is to perform 
   Mobile IPv6 authorization and configuration during the authentication 
   procedure undertaken by the Mobile Node to gain network access. 
   In particular, this draft defines a method to: 
    
   - explicitly authorize the use of Mobile IPv6 based on the service 
     profile of the user, its position within the network, etc. 
    
   - dynamically allocate a Home Agent to the Mobile Node;

   - dynamically configure Mobile IPv6 start-up parameters (i.e. MIPv6 
     bootstrapping) on both the Home Agent and the Mobile Node. These 
     parameters include the Home Address and the cryptographic material 
     needed to set-up the IPsec Security Association used to protect 
     Mobile IPv6 signaling (i.e. Binding Updates and Binding 
     Acknowledgements); 
    
   - allow the MN to negotiate additional Mobile IPv6 service options, 
     such as the assignment of a HA within the visited domain. 
    
   Figure 1 shows the overall architecture of the solution proposed in 
   this draft. The central element of the architecture is the AAA server 
   of the Home Domain (i.e. AAAH), which interacts with both the MN and 
   the selected HA to perform service authorization and configuration.

                     Figure 1 - Solution architecture 
    
   The solution is applicable to any access network relying on EAP [6] 
   for user authentication and works with all EAP methods supporting the 
   exchange of general purpose information elements, in the form of TLVs 
   or AVPs, between EAP peers. Exploiting this capability, MN and AAAH 
   can embed MIPv6 negotiation signaling within the same EAP 
   conversation used to carry out user authentication. 
 
   This kind of operation is already supported by several tunneled (e.g. 
   PEAPv2 [4]) and non tunneled (e.g. EAP-IKEv2 [8]) EAP methods, that 
   also include native support for encryption, authentication and

   integrity protection of exchanged configuration information (e.g. HA 
   address). 
 
   Figure 2 shows an overview of the procedure defined to handle MIPv6 
   bootstrap on the Mobile Node. For the sake of simplicity it is 
   assumed that the employed AAA protocol is Diameter, but obviously 
   RADIUS is suitable as well. 
    
   The whole procedure can be divided in six steps: 
    
   1.EAP identity exchange (i.e. exchange of EAP Request Identity and 
     EAP Response Identity messages); 
    
   2.set-up of a protected channel (e.g. TLS tunnel) for the delivery 
     of subsequent EAP signaling. This is an optional step that is 
     present only if the EAP method provides confidentiality support. 
     It is mandatory only if the MIPv6 negotiation procedure involves 
     the exchange of sensible information; 
 
   3.authentication phase. The actual authentication procedure and its 
     security properties depend on the selected EAP method. In tunneled 
     EAP methods (e.g. PEAPv2) this step may involve one or more 
     complete EAP conversations occurring within a previously 
     negotiated TLS session. Each EAP conversation may accomplish user 
     authentication relying on any available EAP method (e.g. EAP-MD5, 
     EAP-SIM, EAP-AKA); 
 
   4.Mobile IPv6 service authorization and configuration. MN and AAAH 
     exchange a sequence of signaling messages to authorize and 
     configure Mobile IPv6. Those messages are encapsulated in TLVs (or 
     AVPs) delivered as part of the on-going EAP session. If the EAP 
     method provides confidentiality this protocol handshake is 
     encrypted using the previously negotiated ciphersuite. During this 
     phase, AAAH selects a suitable Home Agent for the MN and exchanges 
     authorization and configuration data with it using a AAAH-HA 
     protocol (e.g. SNMPv3 [16], COPS-PR [15], a new Diameter 
     application), whose specification is out of the scope of the 
     present document. At the end of this phase, the MN knows its own 
     Home Address, the address of the correspondent Home Agent and the 
     cryptographic material (i.e. pre-shared key) needed to set-up an 
     IPsec security association with IKE [12]. The IKE pre-shared key 
     can be either constructed by AAAH and then delivered to MN in a 
     proper TLV or can be independently derived by MN and AAAH from the 
     EAP key hierarchy; 
 
   5.EAP session termination. Assuming the mobile node has been 
     successfully authenticated, the AAAH server sends a Diameter EAP 
     Answer message with Result-Code equal to SUCCESS and, optionally, 
     other authorization AVPs containing some filtering rules to be

     enforced on the NAS (e.g. the AP if the access network is a WLAN, 
     or the Enforcement Point in case of an IP network running the PANA 
     [13] protocol). Then the NAS extracts the EAP Success message from 
     the Diameter EAP Answer and forwards it to the MN terminating the 
     EAP session; 
 
   6.set-up of IPsec Security Association and MIPv6 registration. At 
     the end of the EAP communication, the MN gains network access and 
     acquires a valid Care-of Address within the visited subnet (e.g. 
     via stateless autoconfiguration); then, using the cryptographic 
     material collected during the MIPv6 negotiation phase (step 4), it 
     performs an IKE exchange to establish the IPsec Security 
     Association with the HA. Finally, the MN performs MIPv6 
     registration, sending a Binding Update (protected with IPsec) to 
     the HA.

Internet-Draft     MIPv6 Authorization based on EAP          July 2004 
 
 
   This draft also defines the procedures to handle re-authentication 
   events and to manage the termination of the Mobile IPv6 session.  
    
   In summary, the proposed architecture has the following advantages: 
    
   - allows the operator to maintain a centralized management (on the 
     AAA server) of the user profiles and the authentication, 
     authorization and accounting procedures for any type of service, 
     including Mobile IPv6; 
    
   - improves the reliability and performance of the Mobile IPv6 
     protocol, in that the HA to be dynamically assigned to the MN can 
     be freely chosen among those that are closest to the user's point 
     of attachment, thus optimizing network usage and reducing the 
     transfer delay for data traffic in bi-directional tunneling; 
 
   - can be deployed, or extended with new features, without having to 
     update the access equipment and the AAA protocols in use. Only 
     minor changes in the AAA servers, the Home Agents and the mobile 
     terminals are required, in that the AAA client does not play any 
     active role in MIPv6 negotiation (i.e. it is a pass-through for 
     EAP signaling). This reduces the deployment costs and makes the 
     solution easy to use even when a Mobile Node is roaming with a 
     provider different from its own; 
 
   - allows the usage of any AAA protocol supporting the transport of 
     EAP messages for the communication between the AAA client and 
     server (i.e. not just Diameter, but also RADIUS). This 
     significantly simplifies the deployment of MIPv6 in existing 
     communication networks, where support for Diameter protocol in 
     access equipment is not so extensive. 
    
   As a whole, the solution adds a maximum of 2 RTTs (see the detailed 
   protocol description in section 5) to the EAP conversation carried 
   out by the mobile node to authenticate itself and gain network 
   access. The number of extra RTTs can be reduced if the employed EAP 
   method has the capability of transporting MIPv6 negotiation TLVs (or 
   AVPs) together with authentication data. Nonetheless, it should be 
   noted that the full negotiation procedure can be undertaken by the MN 
   only during its initial bootstrap, and therefore the performance 
   requirements are not so strict.

4. Requirements on EAP methods 
    
   In EAP methods, the EAP peer and EAP server exchange data in order  
   to authenticate the EAP peer and eventually the EAP server (mutual 
   authentication). This draft proposes the use of these exchanges to 
   transport MIPv6 parameters, as part of an handshake that requires at 
   maximum 2 RTTs. Thus, the main requirement for the applicability of 
   our proposal is: 
    
   - the EAP method must provide a way to carry arbitrary parameters 
     during or after the authentication phase. This implies that the 
     EAP method must provide messages and mechanisms for this purpose. 
    
   Then, for security reasons, the EAP method must provide the following 
   properties: 
    
   - mutual authentication: the EAP method must provide mutual 
     authentication. The access network must authenticate users   
     before granting them Mobile IPv6 service and the EAP peer should    
     authenticate the access network before delivering sensitive    
     data; 
 
   - integrity: the exchanged MIPv6 parameters must be protected 
     against any alteration and thus the EAP method must provide 
     integrity protection; 
    
   - replay protection: the EAP messages containing MIPv6 parameters 
     must be protected against Replay Attack, so that an attacker is 
     not able to get previous given data by replaying an old request; 
 
   - confidentiality: depending on which data the AAA server provides 
     to the mobile node (e.g. an IKE pre-shared key), it may be 
     necessary to protect the message exchange against eavesdropping. 
 
   The table below checks some existing EAP methods against the 
   requirements listed above.

   In summary, it is possible to note that the procedure described in 
   this draft can be successfully undertaken with several tunneled 
   (PEAPv2, EAP-FAST and EAP-TTLS) and non tunneled EAP methods (EAP-
   IKEv2, EAP-SIM, EAP-AKA, EAP-TLS), that all support the transport of 
   arbitrary parameters in the form of TLVs or AVPs. 
    
    
5. Detailed Description of the Protocol 
    
   This section details the procedures and message exchanges that can be 
   adopted by the network operator to explicitly authorize the 
   activation of Mobile IPv6 support for a specific user as well as 
   enable dynamic bootstrapping of MIPv6 protocol parameters (e.g. Home 
   Address, Home Agent Address). 
    
5.1 Mobile Node bootstrap 
    
   If EAP is used for access control, when the MN enters the network it 
   is immediately polled for its identity, by means of an EAP Request 
   Identity message. This message is used to start the EAP 
   communication. The MN replies sending its identity, in the form of a 
   NAI (Network Access Identifier), within an EAP Response Identity 
   message, that is received by a local attendant (e.g. the Access Point

   in the case of a Wireless LAN) and forwarded via AAA routing to the 
   AAAH server using the Diameter EAP Application (or the RADIUS EAP 
   extensions). Then the AAAH server selects an EAP method (e.g. based 
   on the user service profile) and proposes it to the MN in subsequent 
   EAP messages. In order to enable the Mobile IPv6 negotiation 
   procedure defined in this document, the EAP method chosen by the AAAH 
   server must be an EAP method supporting the transport of general 
   purpose and variable length information elements, in the form of TLVs 
   (or AVPs), together with authentication data (see section 4). 
    
   After this initial handshake, MN and AAAH undertake the actual 
   authentication phase, that may require the exchange of a variable 
   number of EAP Request/Response messages. In many EAP methods, like 
   PEAPv2 or EAP-IKEv2, the authentication phase is preceded by the 
   establishment of an encrypted channel between MN and AAAH that 
   provides protection capabilities (i.e. privacy, integrity protection, 
   etc.) for all the messages exchanged during the rest of the EAP 
   conversation. 
    
   As soon as the authentication phase is completed, the procedure for 
   MIPv6 bootstrapping may take place. In order to do that, the MN and 
   the AAAH server exploit the on-going EAP communication to exchange a 
   sequence of signaling messages encapsulated in a new TLV, called 
   MIPv6-Authorization-TLV. This TLV is used as a generic container for 
   other, more specific, TLVs. 
    
   The whole bootstrapping procedure is depicted in Figure 3.

                Figure 3 - MIPv6 bootstrapping procedure                 
    
   AAAH starts the MIPv6 negotiation phase sending to the MN a MIPv6-
   Authorization-TLV including the following TLVs: 
    
   - Service-Status-TLV: used to communicate whether the home domain is 
     willing to provide Mobile IPv6 service to the MN. This might 
     depend on the user service profile or on other administrative 
     rules (e.g. service accountability); 
    
   - Service-Options-TLV (optional): used to specify other service 
     options the MN can ask for (e.g. allocation of a HA in the visited 
     domain). 
    
   MN replies to this first message confirming its intention to start 
   Mobile IPv6 and, optionally, providing a set of hints on the desired 
   service capabilities; this is achieved delivering a MIPv6-
   Authorization-TLV including the following TLVs:

Internet-Draft     MIPv6 Authorization based on EAP          July 2004 
 
 
   - Service-Selection-TLV: used by the MN to specify if it is willing 
     to activate Mobile IPv6 protocol operation; 
    
   - Service-Options-TLV (optional): used by the MN to communicate 
     which service options, among those previously advertised by AAAH, 
     it would like make use of; 
 
   - Home-Agent-Address-TLV (optional): used by the MN to suggest a 
     preferred Home Agent. This can be a HA with whom the MN has a pre-
     configured Security Association or a HA acquired through dynamic 
     HA address discovery. The AAAH server treats this indication just 
     as a hint, which means that, for administrative reasons, the MN 
     may be assigned a Home Agent different from the one previously 
     requested; 
 
   - Home-Address-TLV (optional): used by the MN to suggest a preferred 
     Home Address (e.g. an address pre-configured on one of its network 
     interfaces); like the previous TLV, this indication is considered 
     only as a hint by the AAAH server; 
 
   - Interface-Identifier-TLV (optional): through this TLV, the MN can 
     suggest a preferred Interface Identifier (selected according to 
     [9] or following other criteria) to be used by the AAA 
     infrastructure to build the Home Address starting from the 
     selected home prefix. Also in this case, this information, if 
     present, is treated as a pure hint by AAAH. 
    
   If in the Service-Selection-TLV the MN has chosen not to make use of 
   Mobile IPv6, AAAH terminates the EAP communication sending an EAP 
   Success message, since the authentication procedure has been 
   accomplished successfully. 
    
   Otherwise, if the MN has confirmed its willingness to start MIPv6 
   service, AAAH selects a suitable Home Agent through a Home Agent 
   Selection Algorithm. Possible parameters to be taken into account by 
   this algorithm include: current load of available HAs (e.g. number of 
   active bindings), location of the MN and, eventually, the preferences 
   provided by the MN itself in the previous message exchange (i.e. 
   Service-Options-TLV, Home-Agent-Address-TLV, Home-Address-TLV). For 
   example, based on the knowledge of the MN's current point of 
   attachment (i.e. the current NAS), the AAAH server may select, among 
   the HAs available in the home domain, the one that is closest to the 
   MN in terms of IP routing hops. This approach is normally expected to 
   improve performance. However, the detailed definition of a Home Agent 
   Selection Algorithm is out of the scope of this document. 
    
   After a suitable HA has been identified, AAAH interacts with it to 
   dynamically configure all the state needed to enable subsequent MIPv6 
   protocol operations, including the authorization lifetime of the 
 
 
Giaretta, et al.           Expires - January 2005           [Page 12] 
Internet-Draft     MIPv6 Authorization based on EAP          July 2004 
 
 
   MIPv6 service granted to the MN. Possible protocols that can be used 
   for this purpose include Diameter (through a new Diameter 
   Application), SNMPv3 or COPS-PR. Further details about this 
   communication are provided in section 6. Anyway, the detailed 
   specification of the interface between AAAH and HA is out of the 
   scope of this document. 
    
   As soon as the AAAH server has configured the state on the HA, it 
   continues the EAP session communicating to the MN all the MIPv6 
   configuration data it is waiting for. This is achieved delivering to 
   the MN an EAP Request containing a MIPv6-Authorization-TLV and the 
   following sub-TLVs: Home-Address-TLV (i.e. the home address) and 
   Home-Agent-Address-TLV (i.e. the address of the HA). 
    
   The pre-shared key needed to bootstrap the IKE session with the Home 
   Agent, and set-up the correspondent IPsec Security Association, can 
   be derived by the MN from the keying material exported by the 
   employed EAP method. This approach provides excellent security 
   guarantees but requires the definition of a specific Application 
   Master Session Key (AMSK) [14] bound to MIPv6. Alternatively, if the 
   on-going EAP session provides confidentiality support, the AAAH 
   server can override the default behaviour by explicitly delivering a 
   valid PSK to the MN within an IKE-PSK-TLV. 
 
   After the MN has received all the configuration data from the AAAH 
   server (i.e. HA address, Home Address and optionally the PSK), it 
   sends back an EAP Response containing a Negotiation-Result-TLV, 
   stating whether it accepts, or refuses, the proposed arrangement. If 
   the MN refuses the configuration, the AAAH server should immediately 
   release the resources previously allocated on the Home Agent. 
    
   After the completion of the EAP session, MN holds all data needed to 
   perform Mobile IPv6 registration: the MN knows its Home Address, the 
   address of the correspondent Home Agent and all cryptographic data 
   needed to establish the IPsec security association with it; 
   furthermore, since it has been successfully authenticated, the MN can 
   acquire an IPv6 address to be used as Care-of Address. 
    
   The first operation carried out by the MN after the acquisition of 
   the Care-of Address is the establishment of the IPsec Security 
   Association with the HA, that is mandated by [1] to protect MIPv6 
   location update signaling. Set-up of the IPsec SA can be accomplished 
   following the procedure detailed in [11]. In this regard, it is 
   important to note that: 
    
   - since the mutual authentication in IKE Phase 1 is based on a Pre-
     Shared Key (PSK), Aggressive Mode must be used. This is because 
     Aggressive Mode is the only way to use PSK authentication with a

Internet-Draft     MIPv6 Authorization based on EAP          July 2004 
 
 
     NAI as peer identifier [12]. Indeed, the NAI of the MN is the only 
     identity information stored in the HA (see section 6.2); 
    
   - in IKE phase 1 messages, the source address used by the MN has to 
     be the Care-of Address, as described in [11]; the Home Address is 
     used only in IKE phase 2; 
 
   - in IKE phase 2 (Quick Mode), while still using the CoA as source 
     address of IKE messages, the MN has to use the Home Address as its 
     peer identifier, so that the HA can correctly set the MN entries 
     in its Security Policy Database (SPD) and in the Security 
     Association Database (SAD). 
    
   As soon as the IPsec Security Association is established, MN can send 
   a Binding Update to the HA, thus starting up Mobile IPv6 service. 
    
5.2 Management of reauthentication events 
    
   At the expiration of AAA session time-outs or after a change in the 
   point of attachment to the network (e.g. change of Access Point), a 
   re-authentication procedure is performed leading to the user identity 
   to be checked again along with its right to continue exploitation of 
   network resources. To that purpose the AAAH server may repeat a full 
   authentication or, alternatively, decide to use optimizations in 
   order to make the procedure faster. Once this phase is completed the 
   AAAH server also undertakes the re-negotiation of the MIPv6 service. 
    
   Since the MIPv6 bootstrapping procedure is assumed to be completely 
   stateless, when a re-authentication event occurs the AAAH server may 
   not know the state of the MIPv6 service on the MN. For this reason 
   the AAAH server starts the MIPv6 negotiation as in the bootstrap 
   case: it delivers a MIPv6-Authorization-TLV containing a Service-
   Status-TLV and optionally a Service-Options-TLV. 
    
   If the MIPv6 service is not active on the MN the procedure continues 
   as described in section 5.1. Otherwise, the MN replies with a MIPv6-
   Authorization-TLV containing a Service-Selection-TLV indicating that 
   the MIPv6 service is already in use. Furthermore, the MN inserts the 
   Home-Agent-Address-TLV and the Home-Address-TLV to inform the AAAH 
   server about its current state. The AAAH server can then get in touch 
   with the HA to check the integrity of the state and eventually renew 
   the MIPv6 authorization lifetime. If this procedure is accomplished 
   successfully, the AAAH server terminates the EAP communication 
   sending an EAP Success message. Otherwise, the AAAH server should 
   continue the EAP communication renegotiating the MIPv6 service (i.e. 
   allocation of a new HA and related Home Address). 
    
   This solution can be easily deployed even within a network including 
   several AAA servers, each one managing a subset of the available 
 
 
Giaretta, et al.           Expires - January 2005           [Page 14] 
Internet-Draft     MIPv6 Authorization based on EAP          July 2004 
 
 
   Network Access Servers (NASs). This is because the re-negotiation 
   procedure does not assume to have any long term state related to 
   Mobile IPv6 stored on the AAAH server. In this way, everything works 
   correctly even if, due to MN's movements within the network, the AAAH 
   server that handles the re-authentication is not the same server that 
   authenticated the MN for the first time and performed the MIPv6 
   bootstrapping procedure. 
    
    
6. Home Agent considerations  
    
   This section provides further thougths about the AAAH-HA 
   communication and lists specific features that have to be supported 
   by the Home Agent to allow dynamic negotiation of Mobile IPv6 
   protocol parameters. 
    
6.1 Requirements on AAAH-HA communication 
    
   This draft details only the message exchange between the MN and the 
   AAAH server. Obviously a complete Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping solution 
   requires also the definition of a mechanism for the communication 
   between the Home Agent and the AAAH server. Possible protocols that 
   may be used for this purpose include SNMPv3, COPS-PR or Diameter. 
    
   The selected protocol should allow the AAAH server to: 
    
   - verify if the selected HA is available to serve the MN (e.g. based 
     on current traffic load and on the number of active bindings); 
    
   - send to the HA the MN's NAI, the authorization lifetime of the 
     Mobile IPv6 service granted to the MN, the IKE PSK to be used to 
     bootstrap the IPsec Security Association and, optionally, a set of 
     hints for the construction of the Home Address (i.e. a preferred 
     Home Address or a preferred Interface Identifier); 
    
   - obtain from the selected Home Agent a valid Home Address to be 
     assigned to the MN; 
 
   - force the termination of the Mobile IPv6 service for a specific MN 
     removing the state stored on the correspondent HA; 
 
   - manage the extension of the authorization lifetime for a specific 
     MN; 
 
   - retrieve the state associated to a specific MN from the 
     correspondent HA.

Internet-Draft     MIPv6 Authorization based on EAP          July 2004 
 
 
   Moreover, the protocol selected to implement the communication 
   between the AAAH server and the HA should fulfill the following 
   general requirements: 
    
   - inactive peer detection: the AAAH server should be able to 
     promptly detect an HA failure. This may be useful to aid the HA 
     selection algorithm; 
 
   - mutual-authentication: the AAAH server and the HA must be able to 
     authenticate each other in order to prevent the installation of 
     unauthorized state on the HA; 
 
   - confidentiality: since the IKE pre-shared key is derived by the 
     AAAH server and then delivered to the HA, the correspondent 
     message exchange must be protected against eavesdropping. This 
     implies that confidentiality is one of the main requirements; 
 
   - integrity: the exchanged configuration parameters must be 
     protected against any alteration and thus the protocol must 
     provide integrity protection. 
    
6.2 Management of MIPv6 authorization state 
    
   The Home Agent is required to store some authorization data for each 
   of the MNs it is serving. A new data structure may be used for this 
   purpose and it should include at least the following fields:  
    
   - NAI of the user; 
    
   - Home Address assigned to the MN; 
 
   - Cryptographic Data: this field includes all the information to be 
     used for bootstrapping IKE, that is the PSK value and its 
     lifetime; 
 
   - Authorization Lifetime: it is the lifetime of the Mobile IPv6 
     service granted to the MN; 
 
   At the expiration of the Authorization Lifetime the HA should check 
   if there is an active entry for the MN in its Binding Cache in order 
   to verify if the MN is still using Mobile IPv6. If the entry is 
   available the Home Agent should negotiate with the AAAH server an 
   extension of the Authorization Lifetime granted to the MN. Otherwise, 
   the HA should immediately release the authorization state associated 
   to that MN and eventually notify the session termination to the AAAH 
   server (e.g. by means of a Session Termination Request if the 
   employed AAAH-HA protocol is Diameter).

   Moreover, the release of the resources previously allocated on the 
   Home Agent can be undertaken at any time by the AAAH server. 
   Typically this happens at credit exhaustion or when the MN 
   disconnects from the network. 
    
   The policies adopted by the AAAH server to release the resources 
   allocated to the MN may vary depending on the user service profile. 
   For instance, the AAAH server may decide to postpone the release of 
   the resources on the HA in order to allow the MN to continue using 
   the Mobile IPv6 service even if it has moved to an access network for 
   which no roaming agreements are in place (e.g. a corporate network or 
   a network providing cost-free access). In that case, the MN can 
   continue to rely on the IPsec SA previously negotiated with the HA 
   and the respective authorization is managed through the Mobile IPv6 
   Authorization Lifetime.

8. Security Considerations 
    
   The Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping procedure described in this document 
   assumes the MN and the AAA server of the home domain exchange the 
   necessary parameters exploiting the EAP communication established for 
   network access authentication. Therefore, to secure the bootstrapping 
   procedure, the employed EAP method must support mutual authentication 
   as well as integrity and replay protection. Moreover, if the pre-
   shared key needed to bootstrap the IPsec SA with the Home Agent is 
   not derived from the EAP key hierarchy but explicitly delivered to 
   the MN by the AAAH server, the EAP method must also provide 
   confidentiality. Several tunneled and non tunneled EAP methods, like 
   PEAPv2 and EAP-IKEv2, fulfill all of these security requirements.
