      Multipath Communication with Satellite and Terrestrial Links
                 draft-deutschmann-sat-ter-multipath-01

Abstract

   Multipath communication enables the combination of low data rate, low
   latency terrestrial links and high data rate, high latency links
   (e.g., geostationary satellite links) to provide a full-fledged
   Internet access.  However, the combination of such heterogeneous
   links is challenging from a technical point of view.  This document
   describes a possible solution, i.e. an architecture and scheduling
   mechanism.  The applicability of this approach to encrypted transport
   protocols (e.g., Multipath QUIC) is also discussed.

1.  Introduction

   Some areas (e.g., rural areas) suffer from poor Internet connectivity
   (e.g., low data rate DSL lines or old generation cellular networks).
   On the other hand, geostationary satellite Internet access is
   available all over the world with data rates of up to 50 Mbit/s and
   more.  Obviously, the combination of both Internet access types seems
   beneficial.

    Motivation for combining very heterogeneous Internet access links.

                                 Figure 1

   However, the combination of very heterogeneous link types is
   challenging given currently deployed transport protocols.  Some
   applications could be strictly assigned to either the high data rate,
   high latency link (e.g., bulk data transfer) or the low data rate,
   low latency link (e.g., VoIP).  Other applications, especially
   Internet browsing, have more versatile requirements.  Connection
   setup and interactive content require low latency, but transferring
   large objects requires high data rate.  The combination of links as
   shown in Figure 1 cannot outperform a fast terrestrial Internet

   access which is able to provide high data rate and low latency
   simultaneously (e.g, as required for video conferencing or cloud
   gaming), but there still can be a significant improvement regarding
   quality of service and quality of experience.

   Multipath protocols (e.g., Multipath TCP [RFC8684]) can be used for
   simultaneously using multiple Internet access links.  However,
   scheduling is non-trivial in case of very heterogeneous links.  In
   this document, an architecture based on Performance Enhancing Proxies
   and a scheduling mechanism called back-log based scheduling is
   described.

   This document is based on the publication [MMB2020], which also
   contains performance evaluation results obtained with the discrete
   event simulator ns-3.  Performance evaluation results with a Linux-
   based implementation and real networks will be published as soon as
   possible.

                 Multipath-enabled PEPs in access network.

                                 Figure 2

   A PEP-based architecture, similar to Hybrid Access networks [HA2020],
   as shown in Figure 2 is chosen because of several reasons:

   o  For the satellite link, PEPs and protocols suitable for high-
      latency links are required, anyway.

   o  As the PEPs are located at the Access network, there is better
      knowledge of the link characteristics used for multipath
      communication.

   o  The presence of PEPs enables the aggregation of transport layer
      data which can be used for scheduling decisions, as described
      later in Section 4.

   Unlike Multipath TCP [RFC8684], the multipath connection between both
   PEPs is provisioned statically.  A way to interoperate between PEPs
   is out of scope for this document, configurations with SOCKS

   [RFC1928] or the 0-RTT TCP Convert Protocol [RFC8803] are under
   investigation.

3.  Comparison of Link Characteristics

   There is a great difference between both delay and data rate of
   aforementioned links.

   o  Low data rate, low latency terrestrial link: Suitable for
      connection setups and small objects.  Unsuitable for large amounts
      of data.  The transmission duration can be a approximated as

         TransmissionDurationTer = DelayTer + Size/DatarateTer

   o  High data rate, high latency link (geostationary satellite):
      Favorable for large objects.  Unsuitable for latency-sensitive
      data.  The transmission duration can be approximated as

         TransmissionDurationSat = DelaySat + Size/DatarateSat

   By putting both together

      TransmissionDurationTer = TransmissionDurationSat

   a threshold size can be obtained, which describes over which link a
   transmission finishes first:

      ThresholdTerSat
      = (DelaySat - DelayTer) / ((1/DatarateTer) - (1/DatarateSat))

   with the assumption that DatarateSat > DatarateTer and DelaySat >
   DatarateTer.

   Example:
   DatarateTer = 1 Mbit/s, DelayTer = 15 ms,
   DatarateSat = 20 Mbit/s, DelaySat = 300ms,
   leads to ThresholdTerSat = 37.5 kByte, which means that a sum of
   packets smaller than this size finishes on the terrestrial link
   first, whereas a sum of packets greater than this size finishes on
   the satellite link first.

4.  Backlog-Based Scheduling

   With the help of PEPs, data from TCP senders can be aggregated.
   Packets are then sent on the appropriate link based on
   ThresholdTerSat.  As PEPs handle individual TCP flows, new
   connections and flows with little backlog are sent via the
   terrestrial connection, flows with large backlog are sent via the

   satellite link.  For a detailed description and performance
   evaluation see [MMB2020].  Other multipath schedulers are currently
   also under investigation, as the combination of very heterogeneous
   links requires specialized scheduling strategies.

5.  Applicability non-TCP / Enrypted Traffic and QUIC

   The architecture described in Section 2 only works for non-encrypted
   TCP traffic.  As it is the case for every PEP, it does not work for
   enrypted traffic (e.g., VPNs or QUIC).

   However, the use case of bonding very heterogenous links and the
   scheduling mechanism can also be applied to end-to-end protocols
   (e.g., Multipath QUIC [I-D.deconinck-quic-multipath]), which is
   currently work in progress.

   With Multipath QUIC, data and acknowledgements can be sent on
   different paths.  By this, data sent over the high-latency satellite
   link can be acknowledged by the low-latency satellite link,
   effectively halving the round trip time.
