              Signaling MSD (Maximum SID Depth) using OSPF
                 draft-ietf-ospf-segment-routing-msd-06

Abstract

   This document proposes a way to signal Maximum SID Depth (MSD)
   supported by a node at node and/or link granularity by an OSPF
   Router.  In a Segment Routing (SR) enabled network a centralized
   controller that programs SR tunnels needs to know the MSD supported
   by the head-end at node and/or link granularity to impose the SID
   stack of an appropriate depth.  MSD is relevant to the head-end of a
   SR tunnel or Binding-SID anchor node where Binding-SID expansions
   might result in creation of a new SID stack.  Here the term OSPF
   means both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.

1.  Introduction

   When Segment Routing tunnels are computed by a centralized
   controller, it is critical that the controller learns the MSD
   "Maximum SID Depth" of the node or link SR tunnel exits over, so the
   SID stack depth of a path computed doesn't exceed the number of SIDs
   the node is capable of imposing.  This document describes how to use
   OSPF to signal the MSD of a node or link to a centralized controller.

   PCEP SR extensions draft [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing] signals MSD
   in SR PCE Capability TLV and METRIC Object.  However, if PCEP is not
   supported/configured on the head-end of a SR tunnel or a Binding-SID
   anchor node and controller does not participate in IGP routing, it
   has no way to learn the MSD of nodes and links which has been
   configured.  BGP-LS [RFC7752] defines a way to expose topology and
   associated attributes and capabilities of the nodes in that topology
   to a centralized controller.  MSD signaling by BGP-LS has been
   defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-ls-segment-routing-msd].  Typically,
   BGP-LS is configured on a small number of nodes, that do not

   necessarily act as head-ends.  In order, for BGP-LS to signal MSD for
   the all nodes and links in the network MSD is relevant, MSD
   capabilites SHOULD be distributed to every OSPF router in the
   network.

   [I-D.ietf-ospf-mpls-elc] defines Readable Label Depth Capability
   (RLDC) that is used by a head-end to insert Entropy Label (EL) at
   appropriate depth, so it could be read by transit nodes.  MSD in
   contrary signals ability to impose SID's stack of a particular depth.

   MSD of type 1 (IANA Registry), called Base MSD is used to signal the
   total number of SIDs a node is capable of imposing, to be used by a
   path computation element/controller.  In case, there are additional
   SIDs (e.g. service) that are to be imposed to the stack - this would
   be signaled with an another MSD type (TBD), no adjustment to the Base
   MSD should be made.  In the future, new MSD types could be defined to
   signal additional capabilities: entropy labels, SIDs that can be
   imposed thru recirculation, or another dataplane e.g IPv6.

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC4970].

3.  Node MSD TLV

   A new TLV within the body of the OSPF RI Opaque LSA, called Node MSD
   TLV is defined to carry the provisioned SID depth of the router
   originating the RI LSA.  Node MSD is the lowest MSD supported by the
   node.

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |    Type                       |         Length                |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |         Sub-Type and Value ...
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ...


                          Figure 1: Node MSD TLV

   The Type (2 bytes) of this TLV has value of 12.

   Length is variable (minimum of 2, multiple of 2 octets) and
   represents the total length of value field.

   Value field consists of a 1 octet sub-type (IANA Registry) and 1
   octet value.

   Sub-Type 1 (IANA Section), MSD and the Value field contains maximum
   MSD of the router originating the RI LSA.  Node Maximum MSD is a
   number in the range of 0-254. 0 represents lack of the ability to
   impose MSD stack of any depth; any other value represents that of the
   node.  This value SHOULD represent the lowest value supported by
   node.

   Other Sub-types other than defined above are reserved for future
   extensions.

   This TLV is applicable to OSPFv2 and to OSPFv3 [RFC5838] and is
   optional.  The scope of the advertisement is specific to the
   deployment.

4.  Link MSD sub-TLV

   A new sub-TLV called Link MSD sub-TLV is defined to carry the
   provisioned SID depth of the interface associated with the link.

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |    Type                       |         Length                |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |         Sub-Type and Value ...
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ...


                        Figure 2: Link MSD Sub-TLV

   The Type (2 bytes) of this TLV:

   For OSPFv2, the Link level MSD value is advertised as an optional
   Sub-TLV of OSPFv2 Extended Link TLV as defined in [RFC7684], and has
   value of 6.

   For OSPFv3, the Link level MSD value is advertised as an optional
   Sub-TLV of the Router-Link TLV as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-ospfv3-lsa-extend], and has value of 3 (Suggested
   value - to be assigned by IANA).

   Length is variable and similar to what is defined in Section 3.

   Value field consists of a 1 octet sub-type (IANA Registry) and 1
   octet value.

   Sub-Type 1 (IANA Section), MSD and the Value field contains Link MSD
   of the router originating the corresponding LSA as specified for
   OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.  Link MSD is a number in the range of 0-254. 0
   represents lack of the ability to impose MSD stack of any depth; any
   other value represents that of the particular link MSD value.

   Other Sub-types other than defined above are reserved for future
   extensions.

5.  Node MSD vs Link MSD conflict resolution

   When both Node MSD and Link MSD are present, the value in the Link
   MSD MUST be used.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document includes a request to IANA to allocate TLV type codes
   for the new TLV proposed in Section 3 of this document from OSPF
   Router Information (RI) TLVs Registry as defined by [RFC4970].  Also
   for link MSD, we request IANA to allocate new sub-TLV codes as
   proposed in Section 4 from OSPFv2 Extended Link Opaque LSAs Extended
   Link TLV registry and from Router-Link TLV defined in OSPFv3 Extend-
   LSA Sub-TLV registry.

   This document also request IANA to create a new Sub-type registry as
   proposed in Section 3, Section 4.
