    Security of Messages Exchanged Between Servers and Relay Agents
              draft-ietf-dhc-relay-server-security-00.txt

Abstract

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 (DHCPv4) has no
   guidance for how to secure messages exchanged between servers and
   relay agents.  The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6
   (DHCPv6) states that IPsec should be used to secure messages
   exchanged between servers and relay agents, but does not recommend
   encryption.  And, with recent concerns about pervasive monitoring it
   is appropriate to provide recommendations for DHCPv4 and also improve
   the recommendations for DHCPv6.  This document updates RFC1542 and
   RFC3315.

1.  Introduction

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 (DHCPv4) [RFC2131]
   and [RFC1542] has no guidance for how to secure messages exchanged
   between servers and relay agents.  The Dynamic Host Configuration
   Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) [RFC3315] states that IPsec should be used
   to secure messages exchanged between servers and relay agents, but
   does not recommend encryption.  And, with recent concerns about
   pervasive monitoring [RFC7258], it is appropriate to provide
   recommendations for DHCPv4 and also improve the recommendations for
   DHCPv6.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   This document uses terminology from [RFC1542], [RFC2131], and
   [RFC3315].

3.  Security of Messages Exchanged Between Servers and Relay Agents

   The following text replaces the text in RFC3315 section 21.1 and also
   applies to DHCPv4 (RFC1542).  This revised text essentially adds
   encryption as relay agents may forward unencrypted client messages as
   well as include additional sensitive information, such as vendor-
   specific information (for example, [CableLabs-DHCP]) and [RFC7839].
   While IPsec is not mandated for relay to relay, relay to server, and
   server to relay communication, it is highly recommended unless some
   other security mechanisms are already in place (such as VPN tunnels)
   that protect this potentially sensitive traffic from pervasive
   monitoring.

   Relay agents and servers that exchange messages securely use the
   IPsec mechanisms for IPv6 [RFC4301].  If a client message is relayed
   through multiple relay agents, each of the relay agents must have
   established independent, pairwise trust relationships.  That is, if
   messages from client C will be relayed by relay agent A to relay
   agent B and then to the server, relay agents A and B must be
   configured to use IPsec for the messages they exchange, and relay
   agent B and the server must be configured to use IPsec for the
   messages they exchange.

   Selectors               Relay agents are manually configured with the
                           addresses of the relay agent or server to
                           which DHCP messages are to be forwarded.
                           Each relay agent and server that will be
                           using IPsec for securing DHCP messages must
                           also be configured with a list of the relay
                           agents to which messages will be returned.
                           The selectors for the relay agents and
                           servers will be the pairs of addresses
                           defining relay agents and servers and the
                           direction of DHCP message exchange on DHCPv4
                           UDP port 67 or DHCPv6 UDP port 547.

   Mode                    Relay agents and servers MUST use IPsec in
                           transport mode and Encapsulating Security
                           Payload (ESP).

   Encryption and authentication algorithms
                           This document recommends combined mode
                           algorithms for ESP authenticated encryption,
                           ESP encryption algorithms, and ESP
                           authentication algorithms as per section 2.1,
                           2.2, and 2.3 of [RFC7321] respectively.
                           Encryption is recommended as relay agents may
                           forward unencrypted client messages as well
                           as include additional sensitive information,
                           such as vendor-specific information (for
                           example, [CableLabs-DHCP]) and [RFC7839].

   Key management          Because the relay agents and servers are used
                           within an organization, public key schemes
                           are not necessary.  Because the relay agents
                           and servers must be manually configured,
                           manually configured key management may
                           suffice, but does not provide defense against
                           replayed messages.  Accordingly, IKE
                           [RFC2409] / IKE2 [RFC7296] with preshared
                           secrets SHOULD be supported.  IKE/IKEv2 with
                           public keys MAY be supported.  Additional
                           information on manual vs automated key
                           management and when one should be used over
                           the other can be found in [RFC4107].

   Security policy         DHCP messages between relay agents and
                           servers should only be accepted from DHCP
                           peers as identified in the local
                           configuration.

   Authentication          Shared keys, indexed to the source IP address
                           of the received DHCP message, are adequate in
                           this application.

   Availability            Appropriate IPsec implementations are likely
                           to be available for servers and for relay
                           agents in more full featured devices used in
                           enterprise and core ISP networks.  IPsec is
                           less likely to be available for relay agents
                           in low end devices primarily used in the home
                           or small office markets.

4.  Security Considerations

   As this document addresses securing messages exchanged between relay
   agents and servers, the message exchanges between clients and the
   first hop relay agent or server are not secured.  Clients may follow
   the recommendations in [RFC7844] to minimize what information they
   expose or make use of [I-D.ietf-dhc-sedhcpv6] to secure communication
   between the client and server.

   As mentioned in [RFC4552] section 14, the following are known
   limitations of the usage of manual keys:

   o  As the sequence numbers cannot be negotiated, replay protection
      cannot be provided.  This leaves DHCP insecure against all the
      attacks that can be performed by replaying DHCP packets.

   o  Manual keys are usually long lived (changing them often is a
      tedious task).  This gives an attacker enough time to discover the
      keys.

   It should be noted if the recommendations in this document are
   followed, while the DHCP traffic on the wire between relays and
   servers is encrypted, the unencrypted data may still be available
   through other attacks on the DHCP servers, relays, and related
   systems.  Securing these systems and the data in databases and logs
   also needs to be considered - on the systems themselves and if
   transferred over a network (i.e., to network attached storage, for
   backups, or to operational support systems).

   Use of IPsec as described herein is also applicable to Lightweight
   DHCPv6 Relay Agents [RFC6221], as they have a link-local address
   which can be used to secure communication with their next hop
   relay(s).

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no requests of the fantastic IANA team.
