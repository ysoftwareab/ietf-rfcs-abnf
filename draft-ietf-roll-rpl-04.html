<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are a class of network in which
      both the routers and their interconnect are constrained: LLN routers
      typically operate with constraints on (any subset of) processing power,
      memory and energy (battery), and their interconnects are characterized
      by (any subset of) high loss rates, low data rates and instability. LLNs
      are comprised of anything from a few dozen and up to thousands of LLN
      routers, and support point-to- point traffic (between devices inside the
      LLN), point-to-multipoint traffic (from a central control point to a
      subset of devices inside the LLN) and multipoint-to- point traffic (from
      devices inside the LLN towards a central control point). This document
      specifies the IPv6 Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL), which provides a
      mechanism whereby multipoint-to-point traffic from devices inside the
      LLN towards a central control point, as well as point-to-multipoint
      traffic from the central control point to the devices inside the LLN, is
      supported. Support for point-to-point traffic is also available.

Introduction</h3>

<p>Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are made largely of constrained
      nodes (with limited processing power, memory, and sometimes energy when
      they are battery operated). These routers are interconnected by lossy
      links, typically time supporting only low data rates, that are usually
      unstable with relatively low packet delivery rates. Another
      characteristic of such networks is that the traffic patterns are not
      simply unicast, but in many cases point-to-multipoint or
      multipoint-to-point. Furthermore such networks may potentially comprise
      up to thousands of nodes. These characteristics offer unique challenges
      to a routing solution: the IETF ROLL Working Group has defined
      application-specific routing requirements for a Low power and Lossy
      Network (LLN) routing protocol, specified in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-building-routing-reqs'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;building&#8209;routing&#8209;reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Martocci, J., Riou, N., Mil, P., and W.

<a name="rfc.section.1.1"></a><h3>1.1.&nbsp;
Design Principles</h3>

<p>RPL was designed with the objective to meet the requirements
        spelled out in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-building-routing-reqs'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;building&#8209;routing&#8209;reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Martocci, J., Riou, N., Mil, P., and W. Vermeylen, &ldquo;Building Automation Routing Requirements in Low Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-home-routing-reqs'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;home&#8209;routing&#8209;reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Brandt, A., Buron, J., and G. Porcu, &ldquo;Home Automation Routing Requirements in Low Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#RFC5673'>[RFC5673]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Pister, K., Thubert, P., Dwars, S., and T. Phinney, &ldquo;Industrial Routing Requirements in Low-Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>, and <a class='info' href='#RFC5548'>[RFC5548]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Dohler, M., Watteyne, T., Winter, T., and D. Barthel, &ldquo;Routing Requirements for Urban Low-Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>. Because
        those requirements are heterogeneous and sometimes incompatible in
        nature, the approach is first taken to design a protocol capable of
        supporting a core set of functionalities corresponding to the
        intersection of the requirements. (Note: it is intended that as this
        design evolves optional features may be added to address some
        application specific requirements). This is a key protocol design
        decision providing a granular approach in order to restrict the core
        of the protocol to a minimal set of functionalities, and to allow each
        implementation of the protocol to be optimized in terms of, e.g.,
        minimizing required code space and use of limited computation
        resources.
</p>
<p>Multiple instances of the protocol can be operated at the same time
        in order to serve different and potentially antagonistic constraints.
        Instances run independently of one another with no required
        interaction. A node might participate to multiple instances and route
        independently along the associated topologies. This specification
        defines only the protocol operation for the node within one instance.
        Consideration is given to default behavior that enables future
        extensions for the multiple instances and related policies.
</p>
<p>It must be noted that RPL is not restricted to the aforementioned
        applications and is expected to be used in other environments. All
        "MUST" application requirements that cannot be satisfied by RPL will
        be specifically listed in the Appendix A, accompanied by a
        justification.
</p>
<p>The core set of functionalities is to be capable of operating in
        the most severely constrained environments, with minimal requirements
        for memory, energy, processing, communication, and other consumption
        of limited resources from nodes. Trade-offs inherent in the
        provisioning of protocol features will be exposed to the implementer
        in the form of configurable parameters, such that the implementer can
        further tweak and optimize the operation of RPL as appropriate to a
        specific application and implementation. Finally, RPL is designed to
        consult implementation specific policies to determine, for example,
        the evaluation of routing metrics.
</p>
<p>A set of companion documents to this specification will provide
        further guidance in the form of applicability statements specifying a
        set of operating points appropriate to the Building Automation, Home
        Automation, Industrial, and Urban application scenarios.

Topology Instance and Objectives</h3>

<p>A topology instance of RPL exists over the scope of an LLN in
          support of a particular application, or service, and is optimized
          according to a certain objective, as determined by an Objective
          Function (OF), and may be characterized by certain destination
          prefixes as well. A topology instance, or DAG Instance, may be
          administratively associated with an InstanceID.
</p>
<p>A single topology instance may comprise:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>a single Destination Oriented DAG with a single DAG root
              
<ul class="text">
<li>For example, a DAG optimized to minimize latency rooted
                  at a single centralized lighting controller in a home
                  automation application.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>multiple uncoordinated Destination Oriented DAGs with
              independent DAG roots (differing DAGIDs) 
<ul class="text">
<li>For example, multiple data collection points in an urban
                  data collection application that do not have an always-on
                  backbone suitable to coordinate to form a single DAG, and
                  further use the formation of multiple DAGs as a means to
                  dynamically and autonomously partition the network.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a single Destination Oriented DAG with multiple DAG roots
              coordinating over some backbone 
<ul class="text">
<li>For example, multiple border routers operating with a
                  reliable backbone, e.g. in support of a 6LowPAN application,
                  that are capable to act as logically equivalent sinks to the
                  same DAG.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a combination of one of the above as suited to some
              application scenario
</li>
</ul>

<p>The exact deployment scenario is determined as appropriate to the
          application and capabilities of the LLN nodes. What is suitable for
          one deployment may not be possible or necessary for another.
</p>
<p>Traffic is bound to a specific DAG Instance by a marking in the
          flow label of the IPv6 header. Traffic originating in support of a
          particular application may be tagged to follow an appropriate
          instance, for example to follow paths optimized for low latency or
          low energy. The provisioning or automated discovery of a mapping
          between an InstanceID and a type or service of application traffic
          is beyond the scope of this specification.
</p>
<p>Conceptually a node running RPL may capable to maintain a
          membership in multiple DAG Instances in support of different
          application services and/or optimization objectives. For example,
          one instance may optimize for minimizing latency and a separate
          orthogonal instance may optimize for minimizing energy. This
          scenario does introduce some additional considerations, for example
          loop avoidance and default routing behavior. These considerations
          are beyond the scope of this specification and are intended to be
          elaborated on in a future revision of this or a companion
          specification. As such, this specification will deal exclusively
          with the scenario where a node implements RPL in support of a single
          DAG Instance.

Multipoint-to-Point Traffic Flows and DAGs</h3>

<p>Many of the dominant traffic flows in support of the LLN
          application scenarios are MP2P flows (<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-building-routing-reqs'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;building&#8209;routing&#8209;reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Martocci, J., Riou, N., Mil, P., and W.

Porcu, &ldquo;Home Automation Routing Requirements in Low Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#RFC5673'>[RFC5673]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Pister, K., Thubert, P., Dwars, S., and T. Phinney, &ldquo;Industrial Routing Requirements in Low-Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>, and <a class='info' href='#RFC5548'>[RFC5548]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Dohler, M., Watteyne, T., Winter, T., and D. Barthel, &ldquo;Routing Requirements for Urban Low-Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>). These
          flows are rooted at designated nodes that have some application
          significance, such as providing connectivity to an external routed
          infrastructure. The term "external" is used to refer to the public
          Internet or a core private (non-LLN) IP network.
</p>
<p>LLN nodes running RPL will construct Directed Acyclic Graphs
          (DAGs) rooted at DAG roots, which may be naturally designated
          according to their application significance. This structure provides
          the routing solution for the dominant MP2P traffic flows. The DAG
          structure further provides each node potentially multiple successors
          for MP2P flows, which may be used for, e.g., local route repair or
          load balancing.
</p>
<p>Nodes running RPL are able to further restrict the scope of the
          routing problem by using the DAG as a reference topology. By
          referencing a rank property that is related to the positions in the
          DAG, nodes are able to determine their positions in a DAG relative
          to each other. This information is used by RPL in part to construct
          rules for movement relative to the DAG that endeavor to avoid loops.
          It is important to note that the rank property is derived from
          metrics, and not directly from the position in the DAG (<a class='info' href='#DAGRank'>Section&nbsp;5.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>DAG Rank</span><span>)</span></a>).

Point-to-Multipoint Traffic Flows</h3>

<p>As DAGs are organized, RPL will use a destination advertisement
          mechanism to build up routing tables in support of outward P2MP
          traffic flows. This mechanism, using the DAG as a reference,
          distributes routing information across intermediate nodes (between
          the DAG leaves and the root), guided along the DAG, such that the
          routes toward destination prefixes in the outward direction may be
          set up. As the DAG undergoes modification during DAG maintenance,
          the destination advertisement mechanism can be triggered to update
          the outward routing state.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1.4"></a><h3>3.1.4.&nbsp;
Point-to-Point Traffic Flows</h3>

<p>A baseline support for P2P traffic in RPL is provided by the DAG,
          as P2P traffic may flow inward along the DAG until a common parent
          is reached that has stored an entry for the destination in its
          routing table and is capable of directing the traffic outward along
          the correct outward path. RPL also provides support for the trivial
          case where a P2P destination may be a `one-hop' neighbor. In the
          present document RPL does not specify nor preclude any additional
          mechanisms that may be capable to compute and install more optimal
          routes into LLN nodes in support of arbitrary P2P traffic according
          to some routing metric.

DAG Information Object (DIO)</h3>

<p>A DAG Information Object is defined and used by RPL in order to
            build and maintain a DAG. This document defines an ICMPv6 Message
            Type RPL Control Message, which is capable to carry the DIO. The
            DIO message conveys information about the DAG, including:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>A DAGID used to identify the DAG as sourced from the DAG
                root. The DAGID must be unique to a single DAG in the scope of
                the LLN.
</li>
<li>Objective Function identified by an Objective Code Point
                (OCP) as described below.
</li>
<li>Rank information used by nodes to determine their positions
                in the DAG relative to each other.
</li>
<li>Sequence number originated from the DAG root, used to aid
                in identification of dependent sub-DAGs and coordinate
                topology changes in a manner so as to avoid loops.
</li>
<li>Indications and configuration for the DAG, e.g. grounded or
                floating, administrative preference, ...
</li>
<li>A set of path metrics and constraints, as further described
                in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;routing&#8209;metrics]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vasseur, J., Kim, M., Networks, D., and H. Chong, &ldquo;Routing Metrics used for Path Calculation in Low Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</li>
<li>List of additional destination prefixes reachable inwards
                along the DAG.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The DIO messages are issued whenever a change is detected to
            the DAG such that a node is able to determine that a region of the
            DAG has become inconsistent. As the DAG stabilizes the period at
            which RA messages occur is configured to taper off, reducing the
            steady-state overhead of DAG maintenance. The periodic issue of
            DIO messages, along with the triggered DIO messages in response to
            inconsistency, is one feature that enables RPL to operate in the
            presence of unreliable links.

Grounded and Floating DAGs</h3>

<p>Certain LLN nodes may offer connectivity to an external routed
            infrastructure in support of an application scenario. These nodes
            are designated `grounded', and may serve as the DAG roots of a
            grounded DAG. DAGs that do not have a grounded DAG root are
            floating DAGs. In either case routes may be provisioned toward the
            DAG root, although in the floating case there is no expectation to
            reach an external infrastructure. Some applications will include
            permanent floating DAGs.

Administrative Preference</h3>

<p>An administrative preference may be associated with each DAG
            root, and thereby each DAG, in order that some DAGs in the LLN may
            be more preferred over other DAGs. For example, a DAG root that is
            sinking traffic in support of a data collection application may be
            configured by the application to be very preferred. A transient
            DAG, e.g. a DAG that is only existing until a permanent DAG is
            found, may be configured to be less preferred. The administrative
            preference offers a way to engineer the formation of the DAG in
            support of the application.

Objective Function (OF)</h3>

<p>The Objective Function (OF) conveys and controls the

            Function is indicated by an Objective Code Point (OCP), and is
            further specified in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;routing&#8209;metrics]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vasseur, J., Kim, M., Networks, D., and H.

<ul class="text">
<li>The set of metrics used within the DAG
</li>
<li>The method used for least cost path determination.

<li>The method used to compute DAG Rank
</li>
<li>The methods used to prepare metrics for propagation within

</ul>

<p>By using defined OCPs that are understood by all nodes in a
            particular implementation, and by conveying them in the DIO
            message, RPL nodes may work to build optimized LLN using a variety
            of application and implementation specific metrics and goals.
</p>
<p>A default OF, OF0 (designated by OCP value of 0x0000), is
            specified with a well-defined default behavior. OF0 may be used to
            define RPL behaviors in the case where a node encounters a DIO
            message containing a code point that it does not support, if
            allowed by policy.

Distributed Algorithm Operation</h3>

<p>A high level overview of the distributed algorithm which
            constructs the DAG is as follows:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Some nodes may be initially provisioned to act as DAG
                roots, either permanent or transient, with associated
                preferences.
</li>
<li>Nodes will maintain a data structure containing their
                candidate (viable) neighbors, as determined by the
                implementation. This data structure will also track DAG
                information as learned from and associated with each
                neighbor.
</li>
<li>Nodes that are members of a DAG, including DAG roots, will
                multicast DIO messages as needed (when inconsistency is
                detected), to their link-local neighbors. Nodes will also
                respond to DIS messages.
</li>
<li>Nodes that receive DIO messages may either discard the DIO
                based on several criteria, including rank-based loop avoidance
                rules, or process the DIO to maintain a position in an
                existing DAG or improve a position as according to an
                Objective Function (OF) and current path cost.
</li>
<li>Nodes manage a set of DAG Parents according to the rules
                specified by RPL. This set is also augmented to include DAG
                siblings.
</li>
<li>DIO messages may be emitted more or less frequently as a
                function of DAG consistency.
</li>
<li>As less preferred DAGs encounter more preferred DAGs that
                offer equivalent or better optimization objectives for the
                same InstanceID, the nodes in the less preferred DAGs may
                leave to join the more preferred DAGs, finally leaving only
                the more preferred DAGs. This is an illustration of the
                mechanism by which an application may engineer DAG
                construction.
</li>
<li>The nodes provision routing table entries for the
                destinations specified by the DIO towards their DAG Parents.
                Nodes may provision a DAG Parent as a default gateway.

Destination Advertisement</h3>

<p>As RPL constructs DAGs, nodes may provision routes toward
          destinations advertised through DIO messages through their selected
          parents, and are thus able to send traffic inward along the DAG by
          forwarding to their selected parents. However, this mechanism alone
          is not sufficient to support P2MP traffic flowing outward along the
          DAG from the DAG root toward nodes. A destination advertisement
          mechanism is employed by RPL to build up routing state in support of
          these outward flows. The destination advertisement mechanism may not
          be supported in all implementations, as appropriate to the
          application requirements. A DAG root that supports using the
          destination advertisement mechanism to build up routing state will
          indicate such in the DIO message. A DAG root that supports using the
          destination advertisement mechanism must be capable of allocating
          enough state to store the routing state received from the LLN.

`One-Hop' Neighbors</h3>

<p>As a special case, a node may periodically emit a link-local
              multicast IPv6 DAO message advertising its locally available
              destination prefixes. This mechanism allows for the one-hop
              neighbors of a node to learn explicitly of the prefixes on the
              node, and in some application specific scenarios this is
              desirable in support of provisioning a trivial `one-hop' route.
              In this case, nodes that receive the multicast destination
              advertisement may use it to provision the one-hop route only,
              and not engage in any additional processing (so as not to engage
              the mechanisms used by a DAG parent).

Operation in Support of Stateful Nodes</h3>

<p>When a (unicast) DAO message reaches a node capable of

              DAO message and updates its local database with a record of the
              DAO message and the neighbor that it was received from. When the
              node later propagates DAO messages, it selects the best (least
              depth) information for each destination and conveys this
              information again in the form of DAO messages to a subset of its
              own DAG parents. At this time the node may perform route
              aggregation if it is able, thus reducing the overall number of
              DAO messages.

Operation in Support of Stateless Nodes</h3>

<p>When a (unicast) DAO message reaches a node incapable of
              storing additional state, the node must append the next-hop
              address (from which neighbor the DAO message was received) to a
              Reverse Route Stack carried within the DAO message. The node
              then passes the DAO message on to one or more of its DAG parents
              without storing any additional state.
</p>
<p>When a node that is capable of storing routing state
              encounters a (unicast) DAO message with a Reverse Route Stack
              that has been populated, the node knows that the DAO message has
              traversed a region of nodes that did not record any routing
              state. The node is able to detach and store the Reverse Route
              State and associate it with the destination described by the DAO
              message. Subsequently the node may use this information to
              construct a source route in order to bridge the region of nodes
              that are unable to support Hop-By-Hop routing to reach the
              destination.

Loop Avoidance and Stability</h3>

<p>The goal of a guaranteed consistent and loop free global routing
        solution for an LLN may not be practically achieved given the real
        behavior and volatility of the underlying metrics. The trade offs to
        achieve a stable approximation of global convergence may be too
        restrictive with respect to the need of the LLN to react quickly in
        response to the lossy environment. Globally the LLN may be able to
        achieve a weak convergence, in particular as link changes are able to
        be handled locally and result in minimal changes to global
        topology.
</p>
<p>RPL does not aim to guarantee loop free path selection, or strong
        global convergence. In order to reduce control overhead, in particular
        the expense of mechanisms such as count-to-infinity, RPL does try to
        avoid the creation of loops when undergoing topology changes.
</p>
<p>RPL includes rank-based mechanisms for detecting loops to ensure
        that packets make forward progress within the DAG and trigger DAG
        repair if necessary.

Greediness and Rank-based Instabilities</h3>

<p>Once a node has joined a DAG, RPL disallows certain behaviors,
          including greediness, in order to prevent resulting instabilities in
          the DAG.
</p>
<p>If a node is allowed to be greedy and attempts to move deeper in
          the DAG, beyond its most preferred parent, in order to increase the
          size of the DAG parent set, then an instability can result. This is
          illustrated in <a class='info' href='#Greedy'>Figure&nbsp;14<span> (</span><span class='info'>Greedy DAG Parent Selection</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Suppose a node is willing to receive and process a DIO messages
          from a node in its own sub-DAG, and in general a node deeper than
          it. In such cases a chance exists to create a feedback loop, wherein
          two or more nodes continue to try and move in the DAG in order to
          optimize against each other. In some cases this will result in an
          instability. It is for this reason that RPL mandates that a node
          never receive and process DIO messages from deeper nodes. This rule
          creates an `event horizon', whereby a node cannot be influenced into
          an instability by the action of nodes that may be in its own
          sub-DAG.
</p>
<p>A further example of the consequences of greedy operation, and
          instability related to processing DIO messages from nodes of greater
          rank, may be found in <a class='info' href='#ExGreedyExample'>Appendix&nbsp;B.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Example: Greedy Parent Selection and Instability</span><span>)</span></a>

<p>Routing metrics are used by routing protocols to compute the shortest

Sheth, &ldquo;M-ISIS: Multi Topology (MT) Routing in Intermediate System to Intermediate Systems (IS-ISs),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>) and OSPF (<a class='info' href='#RFC4915'>[RFC4915]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Psenak, P., Mirtorabi, S., Roy, A., Nguyen, L., and P. Pillay-Esnault, &ldquo;Multi-Topology (MT) Routing in OSPF,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>) use
      static link metrics. Such link metrics can simply reflect the bandwidth
      or can also be computed according to a polynomial function of several
      metrics defining different link characteristics; in all cases they are
      static metrics. Some routing protocols support more than one metric: in
      the vast majority of the cases, one metric is used per (sub)topology.
      Less often, a second metric may be used as a tie-breaker in the presence
      of Equal Cost Multiple Paths (ECMP). The optimization of multiple
      metrics is known as an NP complete problem and is sometimes supported by
      some centralized path computation engine.

<p>In contrast, LLNs do require the support of both static and dynamic
      metrics. Furthermore, both link and node metrics are required. In the
      case of RPL, it is virtually impossible to define one metric, or even a
      composite, that will satisfy all use cases.
</p>
<p>In addition, RPL supports constrained-based routing where constraints
      may be applied to link and nodes. If a link or a node does not satisfy a
      required constraint, it is `pruned' from the candidate list thus leading
      to a constrained shortest path.
</p>
<p>The set of supported link/node constraints and metrics is specified
      in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;routing&#8209;metrics]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vasseur, J., Kim, M., Networks, D., and H. Chong, &ldquo;Routing Metrics used for Path Calculation in Low Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>The role of the Objective Function is to advertise routing metrics
      and constraints in addition to the objectives used to compute the
      (constrained) shortest path.

</p>
<p>The Destination Prefix suboption is used when the DAG root,
                or another node located inwards along the DAG on the path to
                the DAG root, needs to indicate that it offers connectivity to
                destination prefixes other than the default. This may be
                useful in cases where more than one LBR is operating within
                the LLN and offering connectivity to different administrative
                domains, e.g. a home network and a utility network. In such
                cases, upon observing the Destination Prefixes offered by a
                particular DAG, a node MAY decide to join multiple DAGs in
                support of a particular application.
</p>
<p>The Length is coded as the length of the suboption in
                octets, excluding the Type and Length fields.

<p>Prf is the Route Preference as in <a class='info' href='#RFC4191'>[RFC4191]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Draves, R. and D. Thaler, &ldquo;Default Router Preferences and More-Specific Routes,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>. The reserved fields MUST be set to
                zero on transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.
</p>
<p>The Prefix Lifetime is a 32-bit unsigned integer
                representing the length of time in seconds (relative to the
                time the packet is sent) that the Destination Prefix is valid
                for route determination. A value of all one bits (0xFFFFFFFF)
                represents infinity. A value of all zero bits (0x00000000)
                indicates a loss of reachability.
</p>
<p>The Prefix Length is an 16-bit unsigned integer that
                indicates the number of leading bits in the destination
                prefix.
</p>
<p>The Destination Prefix contains Prefix Length significant
                bits of the destination prefix. The remaining bits of the
                Destination Prefix, as required to complete the trailing

</p>
<p>The DAG Timer Configuration suboption is used to distribute
                configuration information for DAG Timer Operation through the
                DAG. The information communicated in this suboption is

                be included periodically by the DAG Root, and SHOULD be
                included in response to a unicast request, e.g. a DAG

</p>
<p>DIOIntervalMin is an 8-bit unsigned integer. Configured on
                the DAG root and used to configure the trickle timer governing

                configured interval for the DIO trickle timer in units of ms
                is 2^DIOIntervalMin. For example, a DIOIntervalMin value of

          a single device is capable to root multiple DAGs in support of an
          application need for multiple optimization objectives it MUST
          produce a different and unique (DagID, InstanceID) pair for each of
          the multiple DAGs.
</p>
<p>For each DAG that a node is, or may become, a member of, the

DAG Rank</h3>

<p>Based on the selection of DAG Parents, the metrics conveyed by the
        most preferred DAG parent, the nodes own metrics and configuration,
        and a related function defined by the OF, a node will be able to
        compute a value for its rank as a consequence of selecting a most
        preferred DAG parent.
</p>
<p>The rank value feeds back into the DAG parent selection according
        to a loop-avoidance strategy. Once a DAG parent has been added, and a
        rank value for the node within the DAG has been computed, the nodes
        further options with regard to DAG parent selection and movement
        within the DAG are restricted in favor of loop avoidance.
</p>
<p>It is important to note that the DAG Rank is not itself a metric,
        although its value is derived from and influenced by the use of
        metrics to select DAG parents and take up a position in the DAG. The
        only aim of the rank is to inform loop avoidance and detection.
</p>
<p>The computation of the DAG Rank MUST be done in such a way so as to
        maintain the following properties for any nodes M and N that are
        neighbors in the LLN:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>DAGRank(M) is less than DAGRank(N):</dt>

            with respect to the metrics and optimizations defined by the
            objective code point. In any fashion, Node M may safely be a DAG

DAG Discovery and Maintenance</h3>

<p>DAG discovery locates the nearest sink (aka root), as determined
        according to some metrics and constraints, and forms a Directed
        Acyclic Graph towards that sink, by identifying a set of DAG parents.
        During this process DAG discovery also identifies siblings, which may
        be used later to provide additional path diversity towards the DAG
        root. DAG discovery enables nodes to implement different policies for
        selecting their DAG parents in the DAG by using implementation
        specific policy functions. DAG discovery specifies a set of rules to
        be followed by all implementations in order to ensure interoperation.
        DAG discovery also standardizes the format that is used to advertise
        the most common information that is used in order to select DAG
        parents.
</p>
<p>One of these information, the DAG rank, is used by DAG discovery to
        provide loop avoidance even if nodes implement different policies. The
        DAG Rank is computed as specified by the OF in use by the DAG,
        demonstrating the properties described in <a class='info' href='#DAGRank'>Section&nbsp;5.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>DAG Rank</span><span>)</span></a>. The rank should be computed in such a way so
        as to provide a comparable basis with other nodes which may not use
        the same metric at all.
</p>
<p>The DAG discovery procedures take into account a number of factors,
        including:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>RPL rules for loop avoidance based on DAGs and ranks
</li>
<li>The Objective Function
</li>
<li>The advertised metrics
</li>
<li>Local policy functions (e.g. a bounded number of candidate
            neighbors).

DAGs</h3>

<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>DAG discovery instantiates LLN topologies that are each
                optimized for specific constraints and goals. A topology
                assumes the shape of a DAG, and a DAG Instance is uniquely
                identified by its instanceID.
</li>
<li>For reasons of scalability and operations of the protocol,
                a DAG Instance is partitioned into a set of DAGs rooted at a
                destination, aka Destination Oriented DAGs. A destination is
                uniquely identified by a DAGID so a DAG rooted at a
                destination is uniquely identified by the pair (InstanceID,
                DAGID).
</li>
<li>A Destination Oriented DAG is periodically reconstructed
                from the root, by incrementing a DAGSequenceNumber. An
                Iteration of a Destination Oriented DAG is thus uniquely
                identified by the tuple (InstanceID, DAGID,
                DAGSequenceNumber). Through this document, the graph formed by
                this iterative process is referred to as the DAG Iteration, or
                in short, the DAG.
</li>
<li>The rank is defined within the scope of a DAG Iteration as
                an abstract coordinate to compare the relative position of
                nodes and ensure forward progress of the traffic.
</li>
<li>A node MUST belong at most to one DAG Iteration per
                InstanceID and MUST select all its parents and siblings within
                that same DAG Iteration.

<li>The root floods a new DAGSequenceNumber periodically, at a

                sufficient to solve the routing issues in that deployment.

<li>The root MAY also flood a new DAGSequenceNumber on-demand.
                The details of the mechanism to signal the root to do so are
                to be specified in a future revision of this document.
</li>
<li>A parent that advertises the new DAGSequenceNumber can not
                possibly belong to the sub-DAG of a node that still advertises
                an older DAGSequenceNumber. The node MAY thus attach to that

<p>As DIO messages are received from candidate neighbors, the
          neighbors may be promoted to DAG parents by following the rules of
          DAG discovery as described in <a class='info' href='#DAGDiscovery'>Section&nbsp;5.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>DAG Discovery and Maintenance</span><span>)</span></a>. When a
          node places a neighbor into the DAG Parent set, the node becomes
          attached to the DAG through the new parent node.
</p>
<p>In the DAG discovery implementation, the most preferred parent
          should be used to restrict which other nodes may become DAG parents.
          Some nodes in the DAG parent set may be of a rank less than or equal
          to the most preferred DAG parent. (This case may occur, for example,
          if an energy constrained device is at a lesser rank but should be
          avoided as per an optimization objective, resulting in a more
          preferred parent at a greater rank).

<a name="rfc.section.5.4.3"></a><h3>5.4.3.&nbsp;
DIO Transmission</h3>

<p>Each node maintains a timer that governs when to multicast DIO
          messages. This timer is implemented as a trickle timer operating
          over a variable interval. Trickle timers are further detailed in
          <a class='info' href='#TrickleImplementation'>Section&nbsp;5.4.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Trickle Timer for DIO Transmission</span><span>)</span></a>. The governing
          parameters for the timer should be configured consistently across
          the DAG, and are provided by the DAG root in the DIO message. In
          addition to periodic DIO messages, each node may respond to a DIS
          message with a DIO message.
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>When a node detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD reset the
              interval of the trickle timer to a minimum value, causing DIO
              messages to be emitted more frequently as part of a strategy to
              quickly correct the inconsistency. Such inconsistencies may be,
              for example, an update to a key parameter (e.g. sequence number)
              in the DIO message or a loop detected when a node located
              inwards along the DAG forwards traffic outwards. Inconsistencies
              are further detailed in <a class='info' href='#TrickleInconsistencies'>Section&nbsp;5.4.4.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Determination of Inconsistency</span><span>)</span></a>.
</li>
<li>When a node enters a mode of consistent operation within a
              DAG, i.e. DIO messages from its DAG parents are consistent and
              no other inconsistencies are detected, it may begin to open up
              the interval of the trickle timer towards a maximum value,
              causing DIO messages to be emitted less frequently, thus
              reducing network maintenance overhead and saving energy
              consumption.
</li>
<li>When a node is initialized, it MAY be configured to remain
              silent and not multicast any DIO messages until it has
              encountered and joined a DAG (perhaps initially probing for a
              nearby DAG with an DIS message). Alternately, it may choose to
              root its own floating DAG and begin multicasting DIO messages
              using a default trickle configuration. The second case may be
              advantageous if it is desired for independent nodes to begin
              aggregating into scattered floating DAGs in the absence of a
              grounded node, for example in support of LLN installation and
              commissioning.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that if multiple DAG roots are participating in the same
          DAG, i.e. offering DIO messages with the same DAGID, then they must
          coordinate with each other to ensure that their DIO messages are
          consistent when they emit DIO messages. In particular the Sequence
          number must be identical from each DAG root, regardless of which of
          the multiple DAG roots issues the DIO message, and changes to the
          Sequence number should be issued at the same time. The specific
          mechanism of this coordination, e.g. along a non-LLN network between
          DAG roots, is beyond the scope of this specification.

Trickle Timer for DIO Transmission</h3>

<p>RPL treats the construction of a DAG as a consistency problem,

</p>
<p>For each DAG that a node is part of, the node must maintain a

Resetting the Trickle Timer</h3>

<p>The trickle timer for a DAGID is reset by:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Setting I_min and I_doublings to the values learned from
                the DIO message.
</li>
<li>Setting C to zero.
</li>
<li>Setting I to I_min.
</li>
<li>Setting T to a random value as described above.
</li>
<li>Restarting the trickle timer to expire after a duration
                T
</li>
</ol>

<p>When node learns about a DAG through a DIO message and makes
            the decision to join it, it initializes the state of the trickle
            timer by resetting the trickle timer and listening. Each time it
            hears a consistent DIO message for this DAG from a DAG parent, it
            MAY increment C.
</p>
<p>When the timer fires at time T, the node compares C to the
            redundancy constant, DEFAULT_DIO_REDUNDANCY_CONSTANT. If C is less
            than that value, the node generates a new DIO message and
            multicasts it. When the communication interval I expires, the node
            doubles the interval I so long as it has previously doubled it
            fewer than I_doubling times, resets C, and chooses a new T
            value.

DAG Sequence Number Increment</h3>

<p>The DAG root makes the sole determination of when to revise the
        DAGSequenceNumber by incrementing it upwards. When the
        DAGSequenceNumber is increased an inconsistency results, causing DIO
        messages to be sent back outwards along the DAG to convey the change.
        The degree to which this mechanism is relied on may be determined by
        the implementation- on one hand it may serve as a periodic heartbeat,
        refreshing the DAG states, and on the other hand it may result in a
        constant steady-state control cost overhead which is not
        desirable.
</p>
<p>Some implementations may provide an administrative interface, such
        as a command line, at the DAG root whereby the DAGSequenceNumber may
        be caused to increment in response to some policy outside of the scope
        of RPL.
</p>
<p>Other implementations may make use of a periodic timer to
        automatically increment the DAGSequenceNumber, resulting in a periodic
        DAG iteration at a rate appropriate to the application and
        implementation. Other automated mechanisms to determine
        DAGSequenceNumber increments are also possible as appropriate to a
        deployment.

DAG Selection</h3>

<p>The DAG selection is implementation and algorithm dependent. Nodes

        destinations compatible with their implementation specific objectives.
        In order to limit erratic movements, and all metrics being equal,
        nodes SHOULD keep their previous selection. Also, nodes SHOULD provide
        a means to filter out a candidate parent whose availability is
        detected as fluctuating, at least when more stable choices are
        available.
</p>
<p>When connection to a fixed network is not possible or preferable
        for security or other reasons, scattered DAGs MAY aggregate as much as
        possible into larger DAGs in order to allow connectivity within the
        LLN.
</p>
<p>A node SHOULD verify that bidirectional connectivity and adequate
        link quality is available with a candidate neighbor before it
        considers that candidate as a DAG parent.

Administrative rank</h3>

<p>When the DAG is formed under a common administration, or when a

        beneficial to associate a range of acceptable rank with that node. For
        instance, a node that has limited battery should be a leaf unless
        there is no other choice, and may then augment the rank computation
        specified by the OF in order to expose an exaggerated rank.

Collision</h3>

<p>A race condition occurs if 2 nodes send DIO messages at the same
        time and then attempt to join each other. This might happen, for
        example, between nodes which act as DAG root of their own DAGs. In
        order to detect the situation, LLN Nodes time stamp the sending of DIO
        message. Any DIO message received within a short link-layer-dependent
        period introduces a risk. It is up to the implementation to define the
        duration of the risk window.
</p>
<p>There is risk of a collision when a node receives and processes a
        DIO within the risk window. For example, it may occur that two nodes
        are associated with different DAGs and near-simultaneously send DIO
        messages, which are received and processed by both, and possibly
        result in both nodes simultaneously deciding to attach to each other.
        As a remedy, in the face of a potential collision, as determined by
        receiving a DIO within the risk window, the DIO message is not
        processed. It is expected that subsequent DIOs would not cross.

Objective Function</h3>

<p>An Objective Function (OF) allows for the selection of a DAG to
          join, and a number of peers in that DAG as parents. The OF is used
          to compute an ordered list of parents. The OF is also responsible to
          compute the rank of the device within the DAG.
</p>
<p>The Objective Function is specified in the DIO message within a
          DAG Metric Container using an Objective Code Point (OCP), as
          specified in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;routing&#8209;metrics]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vasseur, J., Kim, M., Networks, D., and H. Chong, &ldquo;Routing Metrics used for Path Calculation in Low Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>, and
          indicates the method that must be used to compute the DAG (e.g.
          "minimize the path cost using the ETX metric and avoid `Blue'
          links"). The Objective Code Points are specified in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;routing&#8209;metrics]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vasseur, J., Kim, M., Networks, D., and H. Chong, &ldquo;Routing Metrics used for Path Calculation in Low Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>. This document specifies
          an Objective Function, OF0, in support of default operation. In the
          case where the DIO does not include an OCP specification in the DAG
          Metric Container, OF0 MAY be presumed.
</p>
<p>Most Objective Functions are expected to follow the same abstract
          behavior:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The parent selection is triggered each time an event indicates
            that a potential next hop information is updated. This might
            happen upon the reception of a DIO message, a timer elapse, or a
            trigger indicating that the state of a candidate neighbor has
            changed.
</li>
<li>An OF scans all the interfaces on the device. Although there
            may typically be only one interface in most application scenarios,
            there might be multiple of them and an interface might be
            configured to be usable or not for RPL operation. An interface can
            also be configured with a preference or dynamically learned to be
            better than another by some heuristics that might be link-layer
            dependent and are out of scope. Finally an interface might or not
            match a required criterion for an Objective Function, for instance
            a degree of security. As a result some interfaces might be
            completely excluded from the computation, while others might be
            more or less preferred.
</li>
<li>An OF scans all the candidate neighbors on the possible
            interfaces to check whether they can act as a router for a DAG.
            There might be multiple of them and a candidate neighbor might
            need to pass some validation tests before it can be used. In
            particular, some link layers require experience on the activity
            with a router to enable the router as a next hop.
</li>
<li>An OF computes self's rank by adding the step of rank to that
            candidate to the rank of that candidate. The step of rank is
            computed by estimating the link as follows:
</li>
<ul class="text">
<li>The step of rank might vary from 1 to 16.
</li>
<ul class="text">
<li>1 indicates a unusually good link, for instance a link
                between powered devices in a mostly battery operated

</li>
<li>4 indicates a `normal'/typical link, as qualified by the
                implementation.
</li>
<li>16 indicates a link that can hardly be used to forward any
                packet, for instance a radio link with quality indicator or

                threshold.
</li>
</ul>
<li>Candidate neighbors that would cause self's rank to increase
              are ignored
</li>
</ul>
<li>Candidate neighbors that advertise an OF incompatible with the
            set of OF specified by the policy functions are ignored.
</li>
<li>As it scans all the candidate neighbors, the OF keeps the
            current best parent and compares its capabilities with the current
            candidate neighbor. The OF defines a number of tests that are
            critical to reach the objective. A test between the routers
            determines an order relation.
</li>
<ul class="text">
<li>If the routers are roughly equal for that relation then the
              next test is attempted between the routers,
</li>
<li>Else the best of the 2 becomes the current best parent and

</li>
<li>Some OFs may include a test to compare the ranks that would
              result if the node joined either router
</li>
</ul>
<li>When the scan is complete, the preferred parent is elected and
            self's rank is computed as the preferred parent rank plus the step
            in rank with that parent.

Objective Function 0 (OF0)</h3>

<p>This document specifies a default objective function, called OF0,

          function of RPL, and can be used if allowed by the policy of the
          processing node when the OF indicated in the DIO message is unknown
          to the node. If not allowed, then the DIO message is simply ignored
          and not processed by the node. OF0 is notable in that it does not
          use physical metrics as described in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;routing&#8209;metrics]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vasseur, J., Kim, M., Networks, D., and H.

          abstract information from the DIO message such as rank and
          administrative preference.
</p>
<p>OF0 favors connectivity. That is, the Objective Function is
          designed to find the nearest sink into a 'grounded' topology, and if
          there is none then join any network per order of administrative
          preference. The metric in use is the rank.
</p>
<p>OF0 selects a preferred parent and a backup next hop if one is
          available. The backup next hop might be a parent or a sibling. All
          the traffic is routed via the preferred parent. When the link
          conditions do not let a packet through to the preferred parent, the
          packet is passed to the backup next hop.

Establishing Routing State Outward Along the DAG</h3>

<p>The destination advertisement mechanism supports the dissemination
        of routing state required to support traffic flows outward along the
        DAG, from the DAG root toward nodes.
</p>
<p>As a result of destination advertisement operation:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>DAG discovery establishes a DAG oriented toward a DAG root
            along which inward routes toward the DAG root are set up.
</li>
<li>Destination advertisement establishes outward routes along the
            DAG. Such paths consist of:
</li>
<ul class="text">
<li>Hop-By-Hop routing state within islands of `stateful'
              nodes.
</li>
<li>Source Routing `bridges' across nodes that do not retain
              state.
</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>Destinations disseminated with the destination advertisement
        mechanism may be prefixes, individual hosts, or multicast listeners.
        The mechanism supports nodes of varying capabilities as follows:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>When nodes are capable of storing routing state, they may
            inspect destination advertisements and learn hop-by-hop routing
            state toward destinations by populating their routing tables with
            the routes learned from nodes in their sub-DAG. In this process
            they may also learn necessary piecewise source routes to traverse
            regions of the LLN that do not maintain routing state. They may
            perform route aggregation on known destinations before emitting
            Destination Advertisements.
</li>
<li>When nodes are incapable of storing routing state, they may
            forward destination advertisements, recording the reverse route as
            the go in order to support the construction of piecewise source
            routes.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Nodes that are capable of storing routing state, and finally the
        DAG roots, are able to learn which destinations are contained in the
        sub-DAG below the node, and via which next-hop neighbors. The
        dissemination and installation of this routing state into nodes allows
        for Hop-By-Hop routing from the DAG root outwards along the DAG. The
        mechanism is further enhance by supporting the construction of source
        routes across stateless `gaps' in the DAG, where nodes are incapable
        of storing additional routing state. An adaptation of this mechanism
        allows for the implementation of loose-source routing.
</p>
<p>A special case, the reception of a destination advertisement
        addressed to a link-local multicast address, allows for a node to
        learn destinations directly available from its one-hop neighbors.
</p>
<p>A design choice behind advertising routes via destination
        advertisements is not to synchronize the parent and children databases
        along the DAG, but instead to update them regularly to recover from
        the loss of packets. The rationale for that choice is time variations
        in connectivity across unreliable links. If the topology can be
        expected to change frequently, synchronization might be an excessive
        goal in terms of exchanges and protocol complexity. The approach used
        here results in a simple protocol with no real peering. The
        destination advertisement mechanism hence provides for periodic
        updates of the routing state, as cued by occasional RAs and other
        mechanisms, similarly to other protocols such as RIP <a class='info' href='#RFC2453'>[RFC2453]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Malkin, G., &ldquo;RIP Version 2,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a>.

<a name="rfc.section.5.10.1.1"></a><h3>5.10.1.1.&nbsp;
Overview</h3>

<p>According to implementation specific policy, a subset or all of
            the feasible parents in the DAG may be selected to receive prefix
            information from the destination advertisement mechanism. This
            subset of DAG parents shall be designated the set of DA
            parents.
</p>
<p>As DAO messages for particular destinations move inwards along
            the DAG, a sequence counter is used to guarantee their freshness.
            The sequence counter is incremented by the source of the DAO
            message (the node that owns the prefix, or learned the prefix via
            some other means), each time it issues a DAO message for its
            prefix. Nodes that receive the DAO message and, if scope allows,
            will be forwarding a DAO message for the unmodified destination
            inwards along the DAG, will leave the sequence number unchanged.
            Intermediate nodes will check the sequence counter before
            processing a DAO message, and if the DAO is unchanged (the
            sequence counter has not changed), then the DAO message will be
            discarded without additional processing. Further, if the DAO
            message appears to be out of synch (the sequence counter is 2 or
            more behind the present value) then the DAO state is considered to
            be stale and may be purged, and the DAO message is discarded. A
            depth is also added for tracking purposes; the depth is
            incremented at each hop as the DAO message is propagated up the
            DAG. Nodes that are storing routing state may use the depth to
            determine which possible next-hops for the destination are more
            optimal.
</p>
<p>If destination advertisements are activated in the DIO message
            as indicated by the `D' bit, the node sends unicast destination
            advertisements to one of its DA parents, that is selected as most
            favored for incoming outwards traffic. The node only accepts
            unicast destination advertisements from any nodes but those
            contained in the DA parent subset.
</p>
<p>Receiving a DIO message with the `D' destination advertisement
            bit set from a DAG parent stimulates the sending of a delayed
            destination advertisement back, with the collection of all known
            prefixes (that is the prefixes learned via destination
            advertisements for nodes lower in the DAG, and any connected
            prefixes). If the Destination Advertisement Supported (A) bit is
            set in the DIO message for the DAG, then a destination
            advertisement is also sent to a DAG parent once it has been added
            to the DA parent set after a movement, or when the list of
            advertised prefixes has changed.
</p>
<p>A node that modifies its DAG Parent set may set the `D' bit in
            subsequent DIO propagation in order to trigger destination
            advertisements to be updated to its DAG Parents and other inward
            nodes on the DAG. Additional recommendations and guidelines
            regarding the use of this mechanism are still under consideration
            and will be elaborated in a future revision of this
            specification.
</p>
<p>Destination advertisements may advertise positive (prefix is
            present) or negative (removed) DAO messages, termed as no-DAOs. A
            no-DAO is stimulated by the disappearance of a prefix below. This
            is discovered by timing out after a request (a DIO message) or by
            receiving a no-DAO. A no-DAO is a conveyed as a DAO message with a
            DAO Lifetime of ZERO_LIFETIME.
</p>
<p>A node that is capable of recording the state information
            conveyed in a unicast DAO message will do so upon receiving and
            processing the DAO message, thus building up routing state
            concerning destinations below it in the DAG. If a node capable of
            recording state information receives a DAO message containing a
            Reverse Route Stack, then the node knows that the DAO message has
            traversed one or more nodes that did not retain any routing state
            as it traversed the path from the DAO source to the node. The node
            may then extract the Reverse Route Stack and retain the included
            state in order to specify Source Routing instructions along the
            return path towards the destination. The node MUST set the RRCount
            back to zero and clear the Reverse Route Stack prior to passing
            the DAO message information on.
</p>
<p>A node that is unable to record the state information conveyed
            in the DAO message will append the next-hop address to the Reverse
            Route Stack, increment the RRCount, and then pass the destination
            advertisement on without recording any additional state. In this
            way the Reverse Route Stack will contain a vector of next hops
            that must be traversed along the reverse path that the DAO message
            has traveled. The vector will be ordered such that the node
            closest to the destination will appear first in the list. In such
            cases, if it is useful to the implementation to try and build up
            redundant paths, the node may choose to convey the destination
            advertisement to one or more DAG parents in order of preference as
            guided by an implementation specific policy.
</p>
<p>In some cases (called hybrid cases), some nodes along the path
            a destination advertisement follows inward along the DAG may store
            state and some may not. The destination advertisement mechanism
            allows for the provisioning of routing state such that when a
            packet is traversing outwards along the DAG, some nodes may be
            able to directly forward to the next hop, and other nodes may be
            able to specify a piecewise source route in order to bridge spans
            of stateless nodes within the path on the way to the desired
            destination.
</p>
<p>In the case where no node is able to store any routing state as
            destination advertisements pass by, and the DAG root ends up with
            DAO messages that contain a completely specified route back to the
            originating node in the form of the inverted Reverse Route Stack.
            A DAG root should not request (Destination Advertisement Trigger)
            nor indicate support (Destination Advertisement Supported) for
            destination advertisements if it is not able to store the Reverse
            Route Stack information in this case.
</p>
<p>The destination advertisement mechanism requires stateful nodes
            to maintain lists of known prefixes. A prefix entry contains the
            following abstract information:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>A reference to the ND entry that was created for the
                advertising neighbor.
</li>
<li>The IPv6 address and interface for the advertising
                neighbor.
</li>
<li>The logical equivalent of the full destination
                advertisement information (including the prefixes, depth, and
                Reverse Route Stack, if any).
</li>
<li>A 'reported' Boolean to keep track whether this prefix was
                reported already, and to which of the DA parents.
</li>
<li>A counter of retries to count how many DIO messages were
                sent on the interface to the advertising neighbor without
                reachability confirmation for the prefix.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that nodes may receive multiple information from different
            neighbors for a specific destination, as different paths through
            the DAG may be propagating information inwards along the DAG for
            the same destination. A node that is recording routing state will
            keep track of the information from each neighbor independently,
            and when it comes time to propagate the DAO message for a
            particular prefix to the DA parents, then the DAO information will
            be selected from among the advertising neighbors who offer the
            least depth to the destination.
</p>
<p>The destination advertisement mechanism stores the prefix
            entries in one of 3 abstract lists; the Connected, the Reachable
            and the Unreachable lists.
</p>
<p>The Connected list corresponds to the prefixes owned and
            managed by the local node.
</p>
<p>The Reachable list contains prefixes for which the node keeps
            receiving DAO messages, and for those prefixes which have not yet
            timed out.
</p>
<p>The Unreachable list keeps track of prefixes which are no
            longer valid and in the process of being deleted, in order to send
            DAO messages with zero lifetime (also called no-DAO) to the DA
            parents.

Destination Advertisement Timers</h3>

<p>The destination advertisement mechanism requires 2 timers;
              the DelayDAO timer and the RemoveTimer.
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The DelayDAO timer is armed upon a stimulation to send a
                  destination advertisement (such as a DIO message from a DA
                  parent). When the timer is armed, all entries in the
                  Reachable list as well as all entries for Connected list are
                  set to not be reported yet for that particular DA
                  parent.
</li>
<li>The DelayDAO timer has a duration that is DEF_DAO_LATENCY
                  divided by a multiple of the DAG rank of the node. The
                  intention is that nodes located deeper in the DAG should
                  have a shorter DelayDAO timer, allowing DAO messages a
                  chance to be reported from deeper in the DAG and potentially
                  aggregated along sub-DAGs before propagating further
                  inwards.
</li>
<li>The RemoveTimer is used to clean up entries for which DAO
                  messages are no longer being received from the sub-DAG.
</li>
<ul class="text">
<li>When a DIO message is sent that is requesting
                    destination advertisements, a flag is set for all DAO

</li>
<li>If the flag has already been set for a DAO entry, the
                    retry count is incremented.
</li>
<li>If a DAO message is received to confirm the entry, the

</li>
<li>If at least one entry has reached a threshold value and

                    longer available, and the related routing states may be

Multicast Destination Advertisement Messages</h3>

<p>It is also possible for a node to multicast a DAO message to
            the link-local scope all-nodes multicast address FF02::1. This
            message will be received by all node listening in range of the
            emitting node. The objective is to enable direct P2P
            communication, between destinations directly supported by
            neighboring nodes, without needing the RPL routing structure to
            relay the packets.
</p>
<p>A multicast DAO message MUST be used only to advertise
            information about self, i.e. prefixes in the Connected list or
            addresses owned by this node. This would typically be a multicast
            group that this node is listening to or a global address owned by
            this node, though it can be used to advertise any prefix owned by
            this node as well. A multicast DAO message is not used for routing
            and does not presume any DAG relationship between the emitter and
            the receiver; it MUST NOT be used to relay information learned
            (e.g. information in the Reachable list) from another node;
            information obtained from a multicast DAO MAY be installed in the
            routing table and MAY be propagated by a router in unicast
            DAOs.
</p>
<p>A node receiving a multicast DAO message addressed to FF02::1
            MAY install prefixes contained in the DAO message in the routing
            table for local use. Such a node MUST NOT perform any other
            processing on the DAO message (i.e. such a node does not presume
            it is a DA parent).

Unicast Destination Advertisement Messages from Child to Parent</h3>

<p>When sending a destination advertisement to a DA parent, a node
            includes the DAOs for prefix entries not already reported (since
            the last DA Trigger from an DIO message) in the Reachable and
            Connected lists, as well as no-DAOs for all the entries in the
            Unreachable list. Depending on its policy and ability to retain
            routing state, the receiving node SHOULD keep a record of the
            reported DAO message. If the DAO message offers the best route to
            the prefix as determined by policy and other prefix records, the
            node SHOULD install a route to the prefix reported in the DAO
            message via the link local address of the reporting neighbor and
            it SHOULD further propagate the information in a DAO message.
</p>
<p>The DIO message from the DAG root is used to synchronize the
            whole DAG, including the periodic reporting of destination
            advertisements back up the DAG. Its period is expected to vary,
            depending on the configuration of the trickle timer that governs
            the RAs.
</p>
<p>When a node receives a DIO message over an LLN interface from a
            DA parent, the DelayDAO is armed to force a full update.
</p>
<p>When the node broadcasts a DIO message on an LLN interface, for
            all entries on that interface:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>If the entry is CONFIRMED, it goes PENDING with the retry
                count set to 0.
</li>
<li>If the entry is PENDING, the retry count is incremented. If
                it reaches a maximum threshold, the entry goes ELAPSED If at
                least one entry is ELAPSED at the end of the process: if the
                RemoveTimer is not running then it is armed with a jitter.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Since the DelayDAO timer has a duration that decreases with the
            depth, it is expected to receive all DAO messages from all
            children before the timer elapses and the full update is sent to
            the DA parents.
</p>
<p>Once the RemoveTimer is elapsed, the prefix entry is scheduled
            to be removed and moved to the Unreachable list if there are any
            DA parents that need to be informed of the change in status for
            the prefix, otherwise the prefix entry is cleaned up right away.
            The prefix entry is removed from the Unreachable list when no more
            DA parents need to be informed. This condition may be satisfied
            when a no-DAO is sent to all current DA parents indicating the
            loss of the prefix, and noting that in some cases parents may have
            been removed from the set of DA parents.

Loop Detection</h3>

<p>RPL loop avoidance mechanisms are kept simple and designed to
        minimize churn and states. Loops may form for a number of reasons,
        from control packet loss to sibling forwarding. RPL includes a
        reactive loop detection technique that protects from meltdown and
        triggers repair of broken paths.
</p>
<p>RPL loop detection uses information that is placed into the packet
        in the flow label. It assumes that the flow label may be overloaded
        for this purpose. The flow label is constructed as follows:

<p>A host that participates to RPL SHOULD zero out all the flags,

          router, and are described in the next section.

Instance Forwarding</h3>

<p>Instance IDs is used to avoid loops between DAGs from different
          origins. DAGs that constructed for antagonistic constraints might
          contain paths that, if mixed together, would yield loops. Those
          loops are avoided by forwarding a packet along the DAG that is
          associated to a given instance.
</p>
<p>The InstanceID is placed by the source in the flow label. It is
          not meaningful if the packet has the flow label set to all zeroes.
          Otherwise it MUST match the DAG instance onto which the packet is
          placed by any node, be it a host or router.
</p>
<p>When a router receives a packet that is flagged with a given
          instance ID and the node can forward the packet along the DAG
          associated to that instance, then the router MUST do so and leave
          the instance ID flag unchanged.
</p>
<p>If any node can not forward a packet along the DAG associated to
          the instance ID in the flow label, then the node MAY either change
          the InstanceID to match a DAG that it is using for this packet or
          discard the packet. That decision is based on a policy.
</p>
<p>The default policy is as follows: if the node can forward along
          the DAG associated to the instance RPL_DEFAULT_INSTANCE then it
          should do so. Otherwise it should drop the packet.

DAG Inconsistency Loop Detection</h3>

<p>The DAG is inconsistent is the direction of a packet does not
          match the rank relationship. A receiver detects an inconsistency if
          it receives a packet with either: </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>the 'O' bit set (to outwards) from a node of a higher
              rank.
</p>
<p>the 'O' bit reset (for inwards) from a node of a lesser
              rank.
</p>
<p>the 'S' bit set (to sibling) from a node of a different
              rank.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The propagation of a new sequence creates local inconsistencies.
          In particular, it is possible for a router to forward a packet to a
          future parent (same instance, same DAGID, higher sequence) without a
          loop, regardless of the rank of that parent. In that case, the
          sending router MUST present itself as a host on the future DAG and
          use a rank of INFINITE_RANK as it forwards the packets via a future
          parent to avoid a false positive.
</p>
<p>One inconsistency along the path is not considered as a critical
          error and the packet may continue. But a second detection along the
          path of a same packet should not occur and the packet is
          dropped.
</p>
<p>This process is controlled by the Rank-Error bit in the Flow
          Label. When an inconsistency, is detected on a packet, if the
          Rank-Error bit was not set then the Rank-Error bit is set. If it was
          set the packet is discarded and the trickle timer is reset.

Sibling Loop Avoidance</h3>

<p>When a packet is forwarded along siblings, it cannot be checked
          for forward progress and may loop between siblings. Experimental
          evidence has shown that one sibling hop can be very useful but is
          generally sufficient to avoid loops. Based on that evidence, this
          specification enforces the simple rule that a packet may not make 2
          sibling hops in a row.
</p>
<p>When a host issues a packet or when a router forwards a packet to
          a non sibling, the Sibling bit in the packet must be reset. When a
          router forwards to a sibling: if the Sibling bit was not set then
          the Sibling bit is set. If the Sibling bit was set then the packet
          is discarded. This does not denote a graph inconsistency but
          indicates that a new graph should probably be formed with a new
          sequence.

DAO Inconsistency Loop Detection and Recovery</h3>

<p>A DAO inconsistency happens when router that has an outwards DAO
          route via a child that is a remnant from an obsolete state that is
          not matched in the child. With DAO inconsistency loop recovery, a
          packet can be used to recursively explore and cleanup the obsolete
          DAO states along a sub-DAG.
</p>
<p>In a general manner, a packet that goes outwards should never go
          inwards again. So rather than routing inwards a packet with the
          Outwards bit set, the router MUST discard the packet. If DAO
          inconsistency loop recovery is applied, then the router SHOULD send
          the packet to the parent that passed it with the DAO-Error bit
          set.
</p>
<p>Upon a packet with a DAO bit set, the parent MUST remove the
          routing states that caused forwarding to that child, clear DAO-Error
          bit and send the packet again. The packet will make its way either
          to an alternate child or inwards to a parent. If that parent still
          has an inconsistent DAO state via self, the process will recurse and
          that state will be cleaned up as well.

Multicast Operation</h3>

<p>This section describes further the multicast routing operations
        over an IPv6 RPL network, and specifically how unicast DAOs can be
        used to relay group registrations inwards. Wherever the following text
        mentions MLD, one can read MLDv2 or v3.
</p>
<p>As is traditional, a listener uses a protocol such as MLD with a
        router to register to a multicast group.
</p>
<p>Along the path between the router and the root of the DAG, MLD
        requests are mapped and transported as DAO messages within the RPL
        protocol; each hop coalesces the multiple requests for a same group as
        a single DAO message to the parent(s), in a fashion similar to proxy
        IGMP, but recursively between child router and parent up to the
        root.
</p>
<p>A router might select to pass a listener registration DAO message
        to its preferred parent only, in which case multicast packets coming
        back might be lost for all of its sub-DAG if the transmission fails
        over that link. Alternatively the router might select to copy
        additional parents as it would do for DAO messages advertising unicast
        destinations, in which case there might be duplicates that the router
        will need to prune.
</p>
<p>As a result, multicast routing states are installed in each router
        on the way from the listeners to the root, enabling the root to copy a
        multicast packet to all its children routers that had issued a DAO
        message including a DAO for that multicast group, as well as all the
        attached nodes that registered over MLD.
</p>
<p>For unicast traffic, it is expected that the grounded root of an
        RPL DAG terminates RPL and MAY redistribute the RPL routes over the
        external infrastructure using whatever routing protocol is used there.
        For multicast traffic, the root MAY proxy MLD for all the nodes
        attached to the RPL routers (this would be needed if the multicast
        source is located in the external infrastructure). For such a source,
        the packet will be replicated as it flows outwards along the DAG based
        on the multicast routing table entries installed from the DAO
        message.
</p>
<p>For a source inside the DAG, the packet is passed to the preferred
        parents, and if that fails then to the alternates in the DAG. The
        packet is also copied to all the registered children, except for the
        one that passed the packet. Finally, if there is a listener in the
        external infrastructure then the DAG root has to further propagate the
        packet into the external infrastructure.
</p>
<p>As a result, the DAG Root acts as an automatic proxy Rendezvous
        Point for the RPL network, and as source towards the Internet for all
        multicast flows started in the RPL LLN. So regardless of whether the
        root is actually attached to the Internet, and regardless of whether
        the DAG is grounded or floating, the root can serve inner multicast
        streams at all times.

Maintenance of Routing Adjacency</h3>

<p>The selection of successors, along the default paths inward along

        outward along the DAG, leads to the formation of routing adjacencies
        that require maintenance.
</p>
<p>In IGPs such as OSPF <a class='info' href='#RFC4915'>[RFC4915]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Psenak, P., Mirtorabi, S., Roy, A., Nguyen, L., and P.

Sheth, &ldquo;M-ISIS: Multi Topology (MT) Routing in Intermediate System to Intermediate Systems (IS-ISs),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>, the maintenance of a routing adjacency
        involves the use of Keepalive mechanisms (Hellos) or other protocols
        such as BFD (<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-bfd-base'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;bfd&#8209;base]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Katz, D. and D. Ward, &ldquo;Bidirectional Forwarding Detection,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>) and MANET
        Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-manet-nhdp'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;manet&#8209;nhdp]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Clausen, T., Dearlove, C., and J. Dean, &ldquo;MANET Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP),&rdquo; July&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>). Unfortunately, such an approach
        is not desirable in constrained environments such as LLN and would
        lead to excessive control traffic in light of the data traffic with a
        negative impact on both link loads and nodes resources. Overhead to
        maintain the routing adjacency should be minimized. Furthermore, it is
        not always possible to rely on the link or transport layer to provide
        information of the associated link state. The network layer needs to
        fall back on its own mechanism.
</p>
<p>Thus RPL makes use of a different approach consisting of probing
        the neighbor using a Neighbor Solicitation message (see <a class='info' href='#RFC4861'>[RFC4861]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Narten, T., Nordmark, E., Simpson, W., and H. Soliman, &ldquo;Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6),&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>). The reception of a Neighbor Advertisement
        (NA) message with the "Solicited Flag" set is used to verify the
        validity of the routing adjacency. Such mechanism MAY be used prior to
        sending a data packet. This allows for detecting whether or not the
        routing adjacency is still valid, and should it not be the case,
        select another feasible successor to forward the packet.

</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>In the scope of this specification, it is preferred to select a
            successor from a DAG that matches the InstanceID marked in the

</li>
<li>If a local administrative preference favors a route that has
            been learned from a different routing protocol than RPL, then use
            that successor.
</li>
<li>If there is an entry in the routing table matching the
            destination that has been learned from a multicast destination
            advertisement (e.g. the destination is a one-hop neighbor), then
            use that successor.
</li>
<li>If there is an entry in the routing table matching the
            destination that has been learned from a unicast destination
            advertisement (e.g. the destination is located outwards along the
            sub-DAG), then use that successor.
</li>
<li>If there is a DAG offering a route to a prefix matching the
            destination, then select one of those DAG parents as a
            successor.
</li>
<li>If there is a DAG parent offering a default route then select
            that DAG parent as a successor.
</li>
<li>If there is a DAG offering a route to a prefix matching the
            destination, but all DAG parents have been tried and are
            temporarily unavailable (as determined by the forwarding
            procedure), then select a DAG sibling as a successor.
</li>
<li>Finally, if no DAG siblings are available, the packet is
            dropped. ICMP Destination Unreachable may be invoked. An
            inconsistency is detected.
</li>
</ol>

<p>TTL MUST be decremented when forwarding. If the packet is being
        forwarded via a sibling, then the TTL MAY be decremented more
        aggressively (by more than one) to limit the impact of possible
        loops.
</p>
<p>Note that the chosen successor MUST NOT be the neighbor that was
        the predecessor of the packet (split horizon), except in the case
        where it is intended for the packet to change from an inward to an
        outward flow, such as switching from DIO routes to DAO routes as the
        destination is neared.

<p>A node in an LLN may learn routing information from different
          routing protocols including RPL. It is in this case desirable to

<a name="rfc.section.A.1.1"></a><h3>A.1.1.&nbsp;
IPv6 Architecture</h3>

<p>RPL is strictly compliant with layered IPv6 architecture.
</p>
<p>Further, RPL is designed with consideration to the practical
          support and implementation of IPv6 architecture on devices which may
          operate under severe resource constraints, including but not limited
          to memory, processing power, energy, and communication. The RPL
          design does not presume high quality reliable links, and operates
          over lossy links (usually low bandwidth with low packet delivery
          success rate).
</p>

<a name="rfc.section.A.1.2"></a><h3>A.1.2.&nbsp;
Typical LLN Traffic Patterns</h3>

<p>Multipoint-to-Point (MP2P) and Point-to-multipoint (P2MP) traffic
          flows from nodes within the LLN from and to egress points are very
          common in LLNs. Low power and lossy network Border Router (LBR)
          nodes may typically be at the root of such flows, although such
          flows are not exclusively rooted at LBRs as determined on an
          application-specific basis. In particular, several applications such
          as building or home automation do require P2P (Point-to-Point)
          communication.
</p>
<p>As required by the aforementioned routing requirements documents,
          RPL supports the installation of multiple paths. The use of multiple
          paths include sending duplicated traffic along diverse paths, as
          well as to support advanced features such as Class of Service (CoS)
          based routing, or simple load balancing among a set of paths (which
          could be useful for the LLN to spread traffic load and avoid fast
          energy depletion on some, e.g. battery powered, nodes).
          Conceptually, multiple instances of RPL can be used to send traffic
          along different topology instances, the construction of which is
          governed by different Objective Functions (OF). Details of RPL
          operation in support of multiple instances are beyond the scope of
          the present specification.

<a name="rfc.section.A.1.3"></a><h3>A.1.3.&nbsp;
Constraint Based Routing</h3>

<p>The RPL design supports constraint based routing, based on a set
          of routing metrics and constraints. The routing metrics and
          constraints for links and nodes with capabilities supported by RPL
          are specified in a companion document to this specification, <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;routing&#8209;metrics]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vasseur, J., Kim, M., Networks, D., and H. Chong, &ldquo;Routing Metrics used for Path Calculation in Low Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>. RPL signals the
          metrics, constraints, and related Objective Functions (OFs) in use
          in a particular implementation by means of an Objective Code Point
          (OCP). Both the routing metrics, constraints, and the OF help
          determine the construction of the Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)
          using a distributed path computation algorithm.

Deferred Requirements</h3>

        addressed as RPL is further specified.

Examples</h3>

<p>Consider the example LLN physical topology in <a class='info' href='#LLNExample'>Figure&nbsp;11<span> (</span><span class='info'>Example LLN Topology</span><span>)</span></a>. In this example the links depicted are all
      usable L2 links. Suppose that all links are equally usable, and that the
      implementation specific policy function is simply to minimize hops. This
      LLN physical topology then yields the DAG depicted in <a class='info' href='#DAGExample'>Figure&nbsp;12<span> (</span><span class='info'>Example DAG</span><span>)</span></a>, where the links depicted are the edges
      toward DAG parents. This topology includes one DAG, rooted by an LBR
      node (LBR) at rank 1. The LBR node will issue DIO messages, as governed
      by a trickle timer. Nodes (11), (12), (13), have selected (LBR) as their
      only parent, attached to the DAG at rank 2, and periodically multicast
      DIOs. Node (22) has selected (11) and (12) in its DAG parent set, and
      advertises itself at rank 3. Node (22) thus has a set of DAG parents
      {(11), (12)} and siblings {((21), (23)}.

<p>Note that the links depicted represent the usable L2

        communicate directly with its neighbors, Nodes (21), (22), (32), and
        (41). Node (31) cannot communicate directly with any other nodes, e.g.
        (33), (23), (42). In this example these links offer bidirectional
        communication, and `bad' links are not depicted.

<p>Consider the example DAG depicted in <a class='info' href='#DAGExample'>Figure&nbsp;12<span> (</span><span class='info'>Example DAG</span><span>)</span></a>. Suppose that Nodes (22) and (32) are
        unable to record routing state. Suppose that Node (42) is able to
        perform prefix aggregation on behalf of Nodes (53), (54), and
        (55).
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Node (53) would send a DAO message to Node (42), indicating the
            availability of destination (53).
</li>
<li>Node (54) and Node (55) would similarly send DAO messages to
            Node (42) indicating their own destinations.
</li>
<li>Node (42) would collect and store the routing state for
            destinations (53), (54), and (55).
</li>
<li>In this example, Node (42) may then be capable of representing
            destinations (42), (53), (54), and (55) in the aggregation
            (42').
</li>
<li>Node (42) sends a DAO message advertising destination (42') to
            Node 32.
</li>
<li>Node (32) does not want to maintain any routing state, so it
            adds onto to the Reverse Route Stack in the DAO message and passes
            it on to Node (22) as (42'):[(42)]. It may send a separate DAO
            message to indicate destination (32).
</li>
<li>Node (22) does not want to maintain any routing state, so it
            adds on to the Reverse Route Stack in the DAO message and passes
            it on to Node (12) as (42'):[(42), (32)]. It also relays the DAO
            message containing destination (32) to Node 12 as (32):[(32)], and
            finally may send a DAO message for itself indicating destination
            (22).
</li>
<li>Node (12) is capable to maintain routing state again, and
            receives the DAO messages from Node (22). Node (12) then
            learns:
</li>
<ul class="text">
<li>Destination (22) is available via Node (22)

Example: DAG Parent Selection</h3>

<p>For example, suppose that a node (N) is not attached to any DAG,
        and that it is in range of nodes (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E). Let all
        nodes be configured to use an OCP which defines a policy such that ETX
        is to be minimized and paths with the attribute `Blue' should be
        avoided. Let the rank computation indicated by the OCP simply reflect
        the ETX aggregated along the path. Let the links between node (N) and
        its neighbors (A-E) all have an ETX of 1 (which is learned by node (N)
        through some implementation specific method). Let node (N) be
        configured to send RPL DIS messages to probe for nearby DAGs.
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Node (N) transmits a RPL DIS message.
</li>
<li>Node (B) responds. Node (N) investigates the DIO message, and
            learns that Node (B) is a member of DAGID 1 at rank 4, and not
            `Blue'. Node (N) takes note of this, but is not yet confident.
</li>
<li>Similarly, Node (N) hears from Node (A) at rank 9, Node (C) at
            rank 5, and Node (E) at rank 4.
</li>
<li>Node (D) responds. Node (D) has a DIO message that indicates
            that it is a member of DAGID 1 at rank 2, but it carries the
            attribute `Blue'. Node (N)'s policy function rejects Node (D), and
            no further consideration is given.
</li>
<li>This process continues until Node (N), based on implementation
            specific policy, builds up enough confidence to trigger a decision
            to join DAGID 1. Let Node (N) determine its most preferred parent
            to be Node (E).
</li>
<li>Node (N) adds Node (E) (rank 4) to its set of DAG parents for
            DAGID 1. Following the mechanisms specified by the OCP, and given
            that the ETX is 1 for the link between (N) and (E), Node (N) is
            now at rank 5 in DAGID 1.
</li>
<li>Node (N) adds Node (B) (rank 4) to its set of DAG parents for
            DAGID 1.
</li>
<li>Node (N) is a sibling of Node (C), both are at rank 5.
</li>
<li>Node (N) may now forward traffic intended for the default
            destination inward along DAGID 1 via nodes (B) and (E). In some
            cases, e.g. if nodes (B) and (E) are tried and fail, node (N) may
            also choose to forward traffic to its sibling node (C), without
            making inward progress but with the intention that node (C) or a
            following successor can make inward progress. Should Node (C) not
            have a viable parent, it should never send the packet back to Node
            (N) (to avoid a 2-node loop).

<p>Consider the example depicted in <a class='info' href='#DAGMaintenance'>Figure&nbsp;13<span> (</span><span class='info'>DAG Maintenance</span><span>)</span></a>-1. In this example, Node (A) is
        attached to a DAG at some rank d. Node (A) is a DAG parent of Nodes
        (B) and (C). Node (C) is a DAG parent of Node (D). There is also an
        undirected sibling link between Nodes (B) and (C).
</p>
<p>In this example, Node (C) may safely forward to Node (A) without
        creating a loop. Node (C) may not safely forward to Node (D),
        contained within it's own sub-DAG, without creating a loop. Node (C)
        may forward to Node (B) in some cases, e.g. the link (C)-&gt;(A) is
        temporarily unavailable, but with some chance of creating a loop (e.g.
        if multiple nodes in a set of siblings start forwarding `sideways' in
        a cycle) and requiring the intervention of additional mechanisms to
        detect and break the loop.
</p>
<p>Consider the case where Node (C) hears a DIO message from a Node
        (Z) at a lesser rank and superior position in the DAG than node (A).
        Node (C) may safely undergo the process to evict node (A) from its DAG
        parent set and attach directly to Node (Z) without creating a loop,
        because its rank will decrease.
</p>
<p>Now consider the case where the link (C)-&gt;(A) becomes nonviable,
        and node (C) must move to a deeper rank within the DAG:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Node (C) must first detach from the DAG by removing Node (A)
            from its DAG parent set, leaving an empty DAG parent set. Node (C)
            may become the root of its own floating, less preferred, DAG.
</li>
<li>Node (D), hearing a modified DIO message from Node (C), follows
            Node (C) into the floating DAG. This is depicted in <a class='info' href='#DAGMaintenance'>Figure&nbsp;13<span> (</span><span class='info'>DAG Maintenance</span><span>)</span></a>-2. In general, any node with no
            other options in the sub-DAG of Node (C) will follow Node (C) into
            the floating DAG, maintaining the structure of the sub-DAG.
</li>
<li>Node (C) hears a DIO message with an incremented
            DAGSequenceNumber from Node (B) and determines it is able to
            rejoin the grounded DAG by reattaching at a deeper rank to Node
            (B). Node (C) adds Node (B) to its DAG parent set. Node (C) has
            now safely moved deeper within the grounded DAG without creating
            any loops.
</li>
<li>Node (D), and any other sub-DAG of Node (C), will hear the
            modified DIO message sourced from Node (C) and follow Node (C) in
            a coordinated manner to reattach to the grounded DAG. The final
            DAG is depicted in <a class='info' href='#DAGMaintenance'>Figure&nbsp;13<span> (</span><span class='info'>DAG Maintenance</span><span>)</span></a>-3

<p>Consider the example depicted in <a class='info' href='#Greedy'>Figure&nbsp;14<span> (</span><span class='info'>Greedy DAG Parent Selection</span><span>)</span></a>. A
        DAG is depicted in 3 different configurations. A usable link between
        (B) and (C) exists in all 3 configurations. In <a class='info' href='#Greedy'>Figure&nbsp;14<span> (</span><span class='info'>Greedy DAG Parent Selection</span><span>)</span></a>-1, Node (A) is a DAG parent for Nodes (B) and
        (C), and (B)--(C) is a sibling link. In <a class='info' href='#Greedy'>Figure&nbsp;14<span> (</span><span class='info'>Greedy DAG Parent Selection</span><span>)</span></a>-2, Node (A) is a DAG parent for Nodes (B) and
        (C), and Node (B) is also a DAG parent for Node (C). In <a class='info' href='#Greedy'>Figure&nbsp;14<span> (</span><span class='info'>Greedy DAG Parent Selection</span><span>)</span></a>-3, Node (A) is a DAG parent for Nodes (B) and
        (C), and Node (C) is also a DAG parent for Node (B).
</p>
<p>If a RPL node is too greedy, in that it attempts to optimize for an
        additional number of parents beyond its preferred parent, then an
        instability can result. Consider the DAG illustrated in <a class='info' href='#Greedy'>Figure&nbsp;14<span> (</span><span class='info'>Greedy DAG Parent Selection</span><span>)</span></a>-1. In this example, Nodes (B) and (C) may most
        prefer Node (A) as a DAG parent, but are operating under the greedy
        condition that will try to optimize for 2 parents.
</p>
<p>When the preferred parent selection causes a node to have only one
        parent and no siblings, the node may decide to insert itself at a
        slightly higher rank in order to have at least one sibling and thus an
        alternate forwarding solution. This does not deprive other nodes of a
        forwarding solution and this is considered acceptable greediness.
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Let <a class='info' href='#Greedy'>Figure&nbsp;14<span> (</span><span class='info'>Greedy DAG Parent Selection</span><span>)</span></a>-1 be the initial
            condition.
</li>
<li>Suppose Node (C) first is able to leave the DAG and rejoin at a

            process a DIO message from Node (C) (against the rules of RPL),
            and then Node (B) leaves the DAG and rejoins at a lower rank,
            taking both Nodes (A) and (C) as DAG parents. Now Node (B) is
            deeper than both Nodes (A) and (C) and is satisfied with 2 DAG
            parents.
</li>
<li>Then Node (C), because it is also greedy, will leave and rejoin
            deeper, to again get 2 parents and have a lower rank then both of
            them.
</li>
<li>Next Node (B) will again leave and rejoin deeper, to again get
            2 parents
</li>
<li>And again Node (C) leaves and rejoins deeper...
</li>
<li>The process will repeat, and the DAG will oscillate between
            <a class='info' href='#Greedy'>Figure&nbsp;14<span> (</span><span class='info'>Greedy DAG Parent Selection</span><span>)</span></a>-2 and <a class='info' href='#Greedy'>Figure&nbsp;14<span> (</span><span class='info'>Greedy DAG Parent Selection</span><span>)</span></a>-3 until the nodes count to infinity and
            restart the cycle again.
</li>
<li>This cycle can be averted through mechanisms in RPL: 
<ul class="text">
<li>Nodes (B) and (C) stay at a rank sufficient to attach to
                their most preferred parent (A) and don't go for any deeper
                (worse) alternate parents (Nodes are not greedy)
</li>
<li>Nodes (B) and (C) do not process DIO messages from nodes
                deeper than themselves (because such nodes are possibly in
                their own sub-DAGs)
</li>
</ul>

Additional Support for P2P Routing</h3>

<p>In some situations the baseline mechanism to support arbitrary P2P
        traffic, by flowing inward along the DAG until a common parent is
        reached and then flowing outward, may not be suitable for all
        application scenarios. A related scenario may occur when the outward
        paths setup along the DAG by the destination advertisement mechanism
        are not be the most desirable outward paths for the specific
        application scenario (in part because the DAG links may not be
        symmetric). It may be desired to support within RPL the discovery and
        installation of more direct routes `across' the DAG. Such mechanisms
        need to be investigated.

Loop Detection</h3>

<p>It is under investigation to complement the loop avoidance
        strategies provided by RPL with a loop detection mechanism that may be
        employed when traffic is forwarded.

Destination Advertisement / DAO Fan-out</h3>

<p>When DAO messages are relayed to more than one DAG parent, in some
        cases a situation may be created where a large number of DAO messages
        conveying information about the same destination flow inward along the
        DAG. It is desirable to bound/limit the multiplication/fan-out of DAO
        messages in this manner. Some aspects of the Destination Advertisement
        mechanism remain under investigation, such as behavior in the face of
        links that may not be symmetric.
</p>
<p>In general, the utility of providing redundancy along outwards
        routes by sending DAO messages to more than one parent is under
        investigation.
</p>
<p>The use of suitable triggers, such as the `D' bit, to trigger DA
        operation within an affected sub-DAG, is under investigation. Further,
        the ability to limit scope of the affected depth within the sub-DAG is
        under investigation (e.g. if a stateful node can proxy for all nodes
        `behind' it, then there may be no need to propagate the triggered `D'
        bit further).

Source Routing</h3>

<p>In support of nodes that maintain minimal routing state, and to
        make use of the collection of piecewise source routes from the
        destination advertisement mechanism, there needs to be some
        investigation of a mechanism to specify, attach, and follow source
        routes for packets traversing the LLN.

Address / Header Compression</h3>

<p>In order to minimize overhead within the LLN it is desirable to
        perform some sort of address and/or header compression, perhaps via
        labels, addresses aggregation, or some other means. This is still
        under investigation.
