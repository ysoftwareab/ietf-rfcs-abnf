r= Reporting Address (plain-text; OPTIONAL; no default).  The value
      MUST be a dkim-quoted-printable string containing the local-part
      of an e-mail address to which a report SHOULD be sent when mail
      signed with this key fails verification because either (a) the
      signature verification itself failed, or (b) the body hash test
      failed.  The format of this reply MUST be as defined in Section 3
      of this document.  To generate a complete address to which the
      report is sent, the verifier simply appends to this value an "@"
      followed by the domain found in the "d=" tag of the signature
      whose validation failed.
