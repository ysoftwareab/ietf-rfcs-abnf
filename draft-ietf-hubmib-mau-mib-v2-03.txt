Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   This memo obsoletes RFC 2239, ''Definitions of Managed Objects for
   IEEE 802.3 Medium Attachment Units (MAUs) using SMIv2''.  This memo

Internet Draft               802.3 MAU MIB                    March 1999


   extends that specification by including management information useful
   for the management of 1000 Mb/s MAUs.

   Ethernet technology, as defined by the 802.3 Working Group of the
   IEEE, continues to evolve, with scalable increases in speed, new
   types of cabling and interfaces, and new features.  This evolution
   may require changes in the managed objects in order to reflect this
   new functionality.  This document, as with other documents issued by
   this working group, reflects a certain stage in the evolution of
   Ethernet technology.  In the future, this document might be revised,
   or new documents might be issued by the Ethernet Interfaces and Hub
   MIB Working Group, in order to reflect the evolution of Ethernet
   technology.

1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing IEEE 802.3 Medium
   Attachment Units (MAUs).

   This memo also includes a MIB module.  This MIB module extends the

   list of managed objects specified in the earlier version of this MIB:
   RFC 2239 [21].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [20].


2.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [1].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        RFC 1155 [2], RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The second version,
        called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5], RFC 1903 [6] and RFC
        1904 [7].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message
        protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
        called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
        The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and
        described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11] and RFC 2274 [12].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations
        and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and
        the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275
        [15].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable

Internet Draft               802.3 MAU MIB                    March 1999


   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.


3.  Overview

3.1.  Relationship to RFC 2239

   This MIB is intended to be a superset of that defined by RFC 2239
   [21], which will go to historic status.  This MIB includes all of the
   objects contained in that MIB, plus several new ones which provide
   additional capabilities.  Implementors are encouraged to support all
   applicable conformance groups in order to make the best use of the
   new functionality provided by this MIB.  The new objects provide
   management support for:

   o    management of 1000 Mb/s devices

   o    management of PAUSE negotiation

   o    management of remote fault status

3.2.  Relationship to RFC 1515

   RFC 2239 was a replacement for RFC 1515 [22], which is now historic.
   RFC 2239 defined a superset of RFC 1515 which contained all of the
   objects defined in RFC 1515, plus several new ones which provided
   additional capabilities.  The new objects in RFC 2239 provided
   management support for:

   o    management of 100 Mb/s devices

   o    auto-negotiation on interface MAUs

   o    jack management

3.3.  MAU Management

   Instances of these object types represent attributes of an IEEE 802.3
   MAU.  Several types of MAUs are defined in the IEEE 802.3 CSMA/CD
   standard [16].  These MAUs may be connected to IEEE 802.3 repeaters
   or to 802.3 (Ethernet-like) interfaces. For convenience this document
   refers to these devices as "repeater MAUs" and "interface MAUs."

   The definitions presented here are based on Section 30.5, "Layer
   Management for 10, 100 & 1000 Mb/s Medium Attachment Units (MAUs)",



Smith, et. al.           Expires September 1999                 [Page 4]

Internet Draft               802.3 MAU MIB                    March 1999


   and Annex 30A, "GDMO Specifications for 802.3 managed object classes"
   of IEEE Std. 802.3, 1998 edition [16].  That specification includes
   definitions for 10Mb/s, 100Mb/s and 1000Mb/s devices.  This
   specification is intended to serve the same purpose: to provide for
   management of all types of Ethernet/802.3 MAUs.

3.4.  Relationship to Other MIBs

   It is assumed that an agent implementing this MIB will also implement
   (at least) the 'system' group defined in MIB-II [18].  The following
   sections identify other MIBs that such an agent should implement.

3.4.1.  Relationship to the Interfaces MIB.

   The sections of this document that define interface MAU-related
   objects specify an extension to the Interfaces MIB [19].  An agent
   implementing these interface-MAU related objects MUST also implement
   the relevant groups of Interface MIB.  The value of the object
   ifMauIfIndex is the same as the value of 'ifIndex' used to
   instantiate the interface to which the given MAU is connected.

   It is expected that an agent implementing the interface-MAU related
   objects in this MIB will also implement the Ethernet-like Interfaces
   MIB, [23].

   (Note that repeater ports are not represented as interfaces in the
   Interface MIB.)

3.4.2.  Relationship to the 802.3 Repeater MIB

   The section of this document that defines repeater MAU-related
   objects specifies an extension to the 802.3 Repeater MIB defined in
   [17].  An agent implementing these repeater-MAU related objects MUST
   also implement the 802.3 Repeater MIB.

   The values of 'rpMauGroupIndex' and 'rpMauPortIndex' used to
   instantiate a repeater MAU variable SHALL be the same as the values
   of 'rptrPortGroupIndex' and 'rptrPortIndex' used to instantiate the
   port to which the given MAU is connected.

3.5.  Management of Internal MAUs

   In some situations, a MAU can be "internal" -- i.e., its
   functionality is implemented entirely within a device.  For example,
   a managed repeater may contain an internal repeater-MAU and/or an
   internal interface-MAU through which management communications
   originating on one of the repeater's external ports pass in order to
   reach the management agent associated with the repeater.  Such

Internet Draft               802.3 MAU MIB                    March 1999


   internal MAUs may or may not be managed.  If they are managed,
   objects describing their attributes should appear in the appropriate
   MIB subtree:  dot3RpMauBasicGroup for internal repeater-MAUs and
   dot3IfMauBasicGroup for internal interface-MAUs.

                       The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's
                       true state is unknown; for example, when it is
                       being initialized.

                       A MAU in the operational(3) state is fully
                       functional, operates, and passes signals to its
                       attached DTE or repeater port in accordance to
                       its specification.

                       A MAU in standby(4) state forces DI and CI to
                       idle and the media transmitter to idle or fault,
                       if supported.  Standby(4) mode only applies to
                       link type MAUs.  The state of
                       rpMauMediaAvailable is unaffected.

                       A MAU in shutdown(5) state assumes the same
                       condition on DI, CI, and the media transmitter
                       as though it were powered down or not connected.
                       The MAU MAY return other(1) value for the
                       rpMauJabberState and rpMauMediaAvailable objects
                       when it is in this state.  For an AUI, this
                       state will remove power from the AUI.

                       Setting this variable to the value reset(6)
                       resets the MAU in the same manner as a
                       power-off, power-on cycle of at least one-half
                       second would.  The agent is not required to
                       return the value reset (6).

                       Setting this variable to the value
                       operational(3), standby(4), or shutdown(5)
                       causes the MAU to assume the respective state
                       except that setting a mixing-type MAU or an AUI
                       to standby(4) will cause the MAU to enter the

           MAX-ACCESS  read-only
           STATUS      current
           DESCRIPTION "If the MAU is a link or fiber type (FOIRL,
                       10BASE-T, 10BASE-F) then this is equivalent to
                       the link test fail state/low light function.
                       For an AUI or a coax (including broadband) MAU
                       this indicates whether or not loopback is
                       detected on the DI circuit.  The value of this
                       attribute persists between packets for MAU types
                       AUI, 10BASE5, 10BASE2, 10BROAD36, and 10BASE-FP.

                       The value other(1) is returned if the
                       mediaAvailable state is not one of 2 through 6.

                       The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's
                       true state is unknown; for example, when it is
                       being initialized.  At power-up or following a
                       reset, the value of this attribute will be
                       unknown for AUI, coax, and 10BASE-FP MAUs.  For
                       these MAUs loopback will be tested on each
                       transmission during which no collision is
                       detected.  If DI is receiving input when DO
                       returns to IDL after a transmission and there
                       has been no collision during the transmission
                       then loopback will be detected.  The value of
                       this attribute will only change during
                       non-collided transmissions for AUI, coax, and
                       10BASE-FP MAUs.

                       For 100Mbps and 1000Mbps MAUs, the enumerations
                       match the states within the respective link
                       integrity state diagrams, fig 32-16, 23-12 and
                       24-15 of sections 32, 23 and 24 of [2].  Any MAU
                       which implements management of auto-negotiation
                       will map remote fault indication to remote
                       fault.

                       The value available(3) indicates that the link,
                       light, or loopback is normal.  The value
                       notAvailable(4) indicates link loss, low light,
                       or no loopback.

                       The value remoteFault(5) indicates that a fault
                       has been detected at the remote end of the link.
                       This value applies to 10BASE-FB, 100BASE-T4 Far
                       End Fault Indication and non-specified remote
                       faults from a system running auto-negotiation.
                       The values remoteJabber(7), remoteLinkLoss(8),
                       and remoteTest(9) SHOULD be used instead of
                       remoteFault(5) where the reason for remote fault
                       is identified in the remote signaling protocol.

                       The value invalidSignal(6) indicates that an
                       invalid signal has been received from the other
                       end of the link.  InvalidSignal(6) applies only
                       to MAUs of type 10BASE-FB.

                       Where an IEEE Std 802.3u-1995 clause 22 MII
                       is present, a logic one in the remote fault bit
                       (reference section 22.2.4.2.8 of that document)
                       maps to the value remoteFault(5), and a logic
                       zero in the link status bit (reference section
                       22.2.4.2.10 of that document) maps to the value
                       notAvailable(4).  The value notAvailable(4)
                       takes precedence over the value remoteFault(5).

                       Any MAU that implements management of clause 37
                       Auto-Negotiation will map the received Remote
                       Fault (RF1 and RF2) bit values for Offline to
                       offline(10), Link Failure to remoteFault(5) and
                       Auto-Negotiation Error to autoNegError(11)."

                       A MAU in the operational(3) state is fully

                       its specification.

                       A MAU in standby(4) state forces DI and CI to
                       idle and the media transmitter to idle or fault,

                       The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's
                       true state is unknown; for example, when it is
                       being initialized.  At power-up or following a
                       reset, the value of this attribute will be
                       unknown for AUI, coax, and 10BASE-FP MAUs.  For
                       these MAUs loopback will be tested on each
                       transmission during which no collision is
                       detected.  If DI is receiving input when DO
                       returns to IDL after a transmission and there
                       has been no collision during the transmission
                       then loopback will be detected.  The value of
                       this attribute will only change during
                       non-collided transmissions for AUI, coax, and
                       10BASE-FP MAUs.

                       For 100Mbps and 1000Mbps MAUs, the enumerations
                       match the states within the respective link
                       integrity state diagrams, fig 32-16, 23-12 and
                       24-15 of sections 32, 23 and 24 of [2].  Any MAU
                       which implements management of auto-negotiation
                       will map remote fault indication to remote
                       fault.

                       The value available(3) indicates that the link,
                       light, or loopback is normal.  The value
                       notAvailable(4) indicates link loss, low light,
                       or no loopback.

                       The value remoteFault(5) indicates that a fault
                       has been detected at the remote end of the link.
                       This value applies to 10BASE-FB, 100BASE-T4 Far
                       End Fault Indication and non-specified remote
                       faults from a system running auto-negotiation.
                       The values remoteJabber(7), remoteLinkLoss(8),
                       and remoteTest(9) SHOULD be used instead of
                       remoteFault(5) where the reason for remote fault
                       is identified in the remote signaling protocol.

                       The value invalidSignal(6) indicates that an
                       invalid signal has been received from the other
                       end of the link.  InvalidSignal(6) applies only
                       to MAUs of type 10BASE-FB.

                       auto-negotiation is not enabled or is not
                       implemented for this MAU, the value of this
                       object determines the operational type of the
                       MAU.  In this case, a set to this object will
                       force the MAU into the specified operating mode.

                       If auto-negotiation is implemented and enabled
                       for this MAU, the operational type of the MAU
                       is determined by auto-negotiation, and the value
                       of this object denotes the type to which the MAU
                       will automatically revert if/when
                       auto-negotiation is later disabled.

                       NOTE TO IMPLEMENTORS:  It may be necessary to
                       provide for underlying hardware implementations
                       which do not follow the exact behavior specified
                       above.  In particular, when
                       ifMauAutoNegAdminStatus transitions from enabled
                       to disabled, the agent implementation MUST
                       ensure that the operational type of the MAU (as
                       reported by ifMauType) correctly transitions to
                       the value specified by this object, rather than

8.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write. Setting these objects can
   have a serious effect on the operation of the network, including:

        enabling or disabling a MAU
        changing a MAU's default type
        enabling, disabling or restarting autonegotiation
        modifying the capabilities that a MAU advertizes during
            autonegotiation.

   Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
   network environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the
   network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2274 [12] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2275 [15] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to those objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.

A.  Change Log

   This section enumerates the changes made to RFC 2239 to produce this
   document.

      (1)   The MODULE-IDENTITY has been updated to reflect the changes
            in the MIB.

      (2)   OBJECT-IDENTITY definitions have been added for gigabit MAU
            types.

      (3)   The ifMauTypeList, ifMauAutoNegCapability,
            ifMauAutoNegCapAdvertised and ifMauAutoNegCapReceived
            objects have been deprecated and replaced by
            ifMauTypeListBits, ifMauAutoNegCapabilityBits,
            ifMauAutoNegCapAdvertisedBits and
            ifMauAutoNegCapReceivedBits.

      (4)   Two new objects, ifMauAutoNegRemoteFaultAdvertised and
            ifMauAutoNegRemoteFaultReceived have been added.

      (5)   Enumerations for 'offline' and 'autoNegError' have been
            added for the rpMauMediaAvailable and ifMauMediaAvailable
            objects.

      (6)   The broadMauBasicTable and mauBroadBasic object group have
            been deprecated.

      (7)   The mauIfGrp100Mbs and mauIfGrpAutoNeg object groups have
            been deprecated and replaced by mauIfGrpHighCapacity and
            mauIfGrpAutoNeg2.

      (8)   A new object group, mauIfGrpAutoNeg1000Mbps, has been added.
