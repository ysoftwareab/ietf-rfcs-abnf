Abstract

   This document states different cases where RFC 6553, RFC 6554 and
   IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulation is required to set the bases to help
   defining the compression of RPL routing information in LLN
   environments.

1.  Introduction

   RPL [RFC6550] defines RPL Option to transmit routing information.
   RFC 6553 [RFC6553] defines how to transmit in a Hop-By-Hop Option RPL
   Information,such as information to avoid and detect loops.  RFC 6554
   [RFC6554] defines the use of Extension header for Source Routing.

   Several discussions in ROLL/6lo/6tisch Mailing Lists took place
   focusing in the definition how to compress RPL Information in
   constrained environment.  ROLL Virtual Interim Meeting (02-2015)
   concluded that there is a need to define how to use RFC 6553, RFC6554
   and tunneling (IP-in-IP) to be able to set the correct environment
   for compression.

3.  Sample/reference topology

   In a typical topology we found 6LBR (6LoWPAN Border Router), 6lR
   (6LoWPAN Router) and 6LN (6LoWPAN Node) as leaf connected in a DODAG
   (Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph).  Between these
   entities messages such as DIS, DIO and DAO are transmitted.  RPL
   defines the RPL Control message as an ICMPv6 information message with
   a Type of 155.  RPL supports two modes of Downward traffic: Storing,
   it is fully stateful or Non-Storing it is fully source routed.  Any
   given RPL Instance is either storing or non-storing.

   In different scenarios the use of RFC 6553, RFC 6554 and tunneling
   can take place:

   -Flow from leaf to root

   -Flow from leaf to Internet

   -Flow from leaf to leaf

   -Flow from Internet to leaf

   -Flow from leaf to root

4.  Example flow from leaf to root

   A leaf node generates DAO and DIS messages and in general does not
   accept them.  Additionally, this kind of nodes accepts DIO messages,
   but in general do not generate them.  (In inconsistency A leaf node
   generates DIO with infinite rank, to fix it).

4.1.  Non-storing

   In non-storing in this case the leaf node uses Hop-By-Hop option (RFC
   6553) to indicate the routing information to send messages to the
   DODAG root, this message is going to be analyzed in each node until
   arrive the DODAG root.

   RFC 6554 was created to strictly send information between RPL routers
   in the same RPL routing domain.  How it would be in 6554?

   TBD: Tunneling is necessary in case that there is information to send
   outside RPL Domain and other cases?

4.2.  Storing

   IP6 6553{X,Y] ?ipip payload.  In storing mode is suitable the use of
   RFC 6553 to send RPL Information through HBH field checking the
   routing table to find out where to send the message.  It may include
   IP-in-IP encapsulation to transmit information not related with the
   RPL domain.

5.  Example flow from leaf to Internet

5.1.  Non-storing

   In this case the IP-in-IP encapsulation should take place to send
   information not related to the RPL domain inside of the RPL domain.

   RPL information from RFC 6553 should not go out to Internet.  The
   router sould take this information out before send the packet to
   Internet.  The HBH Option is going to be analyzed in each node to the
   root.

   Related to RFC 6554 the Source Header route is added and removed by
   DODAG root.  However, RFC 6554 was created to strictly send
   information between RPL routers in the same RPL routing domain.  How
   it would be in 6554?

5.2.  Storing

   In storing the information of RFC 6553 should take away by DODAG root
   before go to Internet.

6.  Example flow from leaf to leaf

   can leafs insert appropriate headers, without ipip?  In [RFC6550] RPL
   allows a simple one-hop P2P optimization for both storing and non-
   storing networks.  A node may send a P2P packet destined to a one-hop
   neighbor direclty to that node.  Section 9 in [RFC6550].

6.1.  Traditional storing

   The route go through an ancestor that knows the route to the
   destination, using HBH [RFC6553] to carry RPL Information.

6.2.  Traditional non-storing

   The route go through the DODAG root, using source routing [RFC6554].

6.3.  P2P non-storing

   (p2p storing?  TBD)

7.  Example flow from Internet to leaf

   A DODAG root do not add routing extension to incoming packets, it
   instead uses tunneling.

7.1.  Storing

   DODAG root adds the HBH header [RFC6553] and send the packet downward
   to the destination.

7.2.  Non-storing

   DODAG root is going to add the source route header [RFC6554]

8.  Example flow from root to leaf

8.1.  Storing

   DODAG root adds the HBH header [RFC6553] and send the packet downward
   to the destination.

8.2.  Non-storing
