1. Introduction

   VPN-oriented Data Center Services (VDCS) integrate the virtual
   resources in data centers and user together using VPN as the common
   link. This kind of service is attractive to customers who often do
   not want to use public Internet to access data center resources.
   VDCS also have more restrictive requirements on what and how the
   virtualized data center resources can be shared. In addition, it
   provides a common service operational management framework using VPN
   as the central control point(s).

3. VDCS service description

   Many data centers offer virtualized services today, allowing clients
   to lease virtual data center resources without actually owning any
   physical servers or storage devices. However, majority of those
   services do not include network infrastructure.  Intra-data center,
   inter-data center networks, and the networks connecting users to data
   centers are designed and operated separately from the data center
   server/storage systems.  It is difficult for customers to integrate
   the leased virtual data center resources with their own internal data
   center resources, and make those leased resources appearing as if
   they come from their internal infrastructure.

     VDCS has the following characteristics:

        A secure collection of servers and/or virtual machines spanning
         one or more data centers.

        All the applications running on the Virtual resources in
         network provider's data centers are connected with the
         enterprise's VPN in the same way as applications running over
         enterprise's internal data centers. Therefore, the enterprises
         can treat those resources as if they are from their internal
         data centers.

        Provide the VPN equivalent level of traffic segregation and
         privacy for those virtual resources attached to the VPN.

        Make the virtual resources' location known to VPN customers.

        Created by network provider with no end host configuration.

        Allow VMs and user devices using VDCS associated with one VPN
         to be partitioned into multiple subnets while still retain the
         detailed knowledge of each other.

        Allow VPN clients to use private IP addresses (IPv4 or IPv6)
         for VDCS.



3.1. Components of VDCS

   There are many components in VDCS system, including (but not limited
   to):

        Network back office support systems, such as provisioning,
        billing, and etc,

        VPN management systems such as monitoring, reporting, trouble
        shooting, and etc.

        Data center resource monitoring systems, which include
        monitoring the utilization of servers and storage devices in
        data centers

        Data center resource management systems, which include VMs
        placement to servers and racks based on the criteria associated
        with VMs.

        Others.

Internet-Draft       Address Resolution for VDCS          July 1, 2011


   This draft only focuses on networking (switching and routing) related
   components within VDCS framework.

3.2. Networking related components in support of VDCS

   In the figure below, Vx represents a VM or a server belonging to VPN-
   x. The data center depicted in the figure has VMs belonging to 5
   different VPNs, VPN-1, VPN-2, VPN-3, VPN-4, and VPN-5. Most data
   centers have many rows of server racks. Each rack holds many servers
   and has 1 or 2 Top of Rack (ToR) switches. Each server can have many
   VMs. The ToRs can be connected to aggregation switches/routers, which
   are then connected to Data Center gateway switches/routers. In some
   data centers, ToRs may be directly connected to Data Center gateway
   switches/routers.

   It is essential to segregate traffic from VMs belonging to different
   VPNs within one data center and across multiple data centers. VLAN is
   usually used to segregate traffic from different VPNs within one data
   center. However, when a data center needs to house virtual machines
   belonging to more than 4095 VPNs, alternative segregation methods
   have to be used.

   The virtual machines in data center can be connected to VDCS via
   L2VPN or L3VPN. For VMs belonging to L3VPN, the data center gateway
   router and the VPN PE router have to maintain detailed VRF tables
   that contain all the VM IP addresses associated with the each VPN.
   For VMs belonging to L2VPN, the data center gateway switch and the
   VPN edge switch have to maintain detailed Learned MAC Table that
   contains all the VM MAC addresses associated with each VPN.

                  Figure 1 VMs and Network in Data Center


   When VMs belonging to one VPN are partitioned into multiple subnets,
   it is necessary to have VLANs or other mechanisms to segregate
   traffic from different subnets belonging to one VPN.




4. Address resolution Scaling Issue for VDCS

4.1. Address Resolution for VMs attached to L2VPN

   Before severs in a data center are instantiated with VMs for a
   particular VPLS L2VPN for the very first time (i.e. there is no VMs
   in the data center belonging to the L2VPN yet), the data center
   gateway router (CE router) should have the base VPLS configured
   already, which means a full mesh of pseudo-wires between L2VPN PEs
   already exist. The CE should have an attachment circuit (AC) built
   for the VPLS service between CE and PE.

   At the time of VDCS instantiation, the new VMs' MAC addresses are
   learned and added to the CE and PE's MAC Table, so they can be
   learned by other switches and end stations already on the L2VPN in
   multiple sites as if they are on one LAN.

   When a host or a VM in a data center needs to communicate with
   another host/VM in the L2VPN, an ARP (IPv4) or a ND(IPv6) is flooded
   to all PWs and all ACs (except the one from which the request is
   coming from).

   Under this scenario, all VMs' MAC addresses belonging to a particular
   L2VPN are visible to each other. And the L2VPN's PEs and VSIs have to
   learn and maintain the MAC and VLAN addresses for all the hosts/VMs
   associated with this L2VPN. This may leads to address table
   scalability problems for data center VSI and L2VPN PE.

   For example, assuming there are 1000 L2VPNs with hosts/VMs residing
   in this data center. That translates to 1000 VSIs on the CE, with

   each VSI containing the entire MAC and VLAN mapping for all the
   switches and end-stations associated with all the L2VPNs. This
   requires a very large amount of memory for the data center gateway
   switch/router using current technology.

4.2. Address Resolution for VMs attached to L3VPN

   When severs in a data center are instantiated with VMs for a
   particular L3VPN for the very first time (i.e. there were no VMs in
   the data center belonging to the L3VPN yet), it assumes that all the
   necessary L3VPN configuration has already been completed on the data
   center gateway router (CE) and the L3VPN edge router (PE). There are
   two scenarios for VMs attached to L3VPN:

        Scenario 1: all the VMs belonging to the L3VPN client are added
        as a separate site for the L3VPN. Under this scenario, the
        provider data center becomes the additional site (or peers) to
        the L3VPN.

Internet-Draft       Address Resolution for VDCS          July 1, 2011


        Scenario 2:  Hosts or applications in client's own data centers
        (or premises) see those VMs attached to L3VPN as if they are
        from the same subnets. Under this scenario, the traditional
        "subnet" concept is broken. VMs in the data center have to be
        connected to their designated sites as if they are in one
        subnet.

   Under scenario 1, the APR/ND broadcast/multicast requests are
   terminated at the CE.  Similar to the condition described in the last
   section on VMs attached to L2VPN, all IP addresses associated with
   all L3VPNs in the data center have to be learned and maintained at
   the CE and the L3VPN PE router.

   This can require a very large amount of memory on the CE and PE
   router using today's technology, especially when the CE and the PE
   routers are hosting both L2VPN and L3VPN simultaneously.  The amount
   of memory requirement is even larger if those VMs addresses can't be
   aggregated.

   In addition, it is possible that IP addresses for VMs belonging to
   different VPNs could be duplicated.

   Under the Scenario 2, the ARP/ND messages from the VMs in the data
   center have to be flooded to the corresponding sites to which those
   VMs belonging. The data center gateway routers (CEs or PEs) have to
   do both L2VPN and L3VPN.



5. Conclusion and Recommendation

    Future data center can scale up to millions of virtual machines.
    Theoretically, network service provider can make their data centers
    hosting VMs for all of their VPN clients. Using current technology,
    it is very difficult for routers in data center and at network edge
    facing the data center to maintain all the VSIs or VRFs needed for
    the huge number of VPNs and the VPN-associated VMs being deployed.

    Therefore, we recommend ARMD WG to investigate alternative solutions
    on address resolution and address scalability issues to make data
    center gateway routers capable of supporting the VPN oriented data
    center services.
