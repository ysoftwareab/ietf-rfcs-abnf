1.  Introduction

   This document introduces an abstract (basic) topology YANG [RFC6020]
   [RFC6021] model, which can be augmented to cover many different
   network topologies.  Applications can operate on any topology at a
   generic level where specifics of particular topology types are not
   required, or at a topology-specific level when those specifics come
   into play.  Examples of specific topology types include Layer 1,
   Layer 2 and Layer 3 topologies, such as unicast or multicast IGP
   topologies (IS-IS [RFC1195] or OSPF [RFC2328]), traffic engineering
   (TE) data [RFC3209], or any of the variety of transport and service
   topologies.  Information specific to particular network topology
   tpyes would be captured in separate, technology-specific models.  The
   basic data model introduced in this document is generic in nature and
   can be applied to many network topologies.

   This document introduces the network-topology YANG module, which
   defines a generic topology model at its most general level of
   abstraction.  The module defines a topology graph and components from
   which it is composed: nodes, edges and termination points.  Nodes
   represent graph vertices and links represent graph edges.  Nodes
   contain termination points that anchor the links.  A network can
   contain multiple topologies, for example topologies at different
   layers and overlay topologies.  The model therefore allows to capture
   relationships between topologies, as well as dependencies between
   nodes and termination points across topologies.  An example of a
   topology stack is shown in the following figure.

   The figure shows three topology levels.  At top, the "Service"
   topology shows relationships between service entities, such as
   service functions in a service chain.  The "L3" topology shows
   network elements at Layer 3 (IP) and the "Optical" topology shows
   network elements at Layer 1.  Service functions in the "Service"
   topology are mapped onto network elements in the "L3" topology, which
   in turn are mapped onto network elements in the "Optical" topology.
   The figure shows two Service Functions - X1 and X2 - mapping onto a
   single L3 network element; this could happen, for example, if two

   service functions reside in the same VM (or server) and share the
   same set of network interfaces.  The figure shows a single "L3"
   network element mapped onto multiple "Optical" network elements.
   This could happen, for example, if a single IP router attaches to
   multiple ROADMs in the optical domain.

   There are multiple applications for such a data model.  For example,
   within the context of I2RS, nodes within the network can use the data
   model to capture their understanding of the overall network topology
   and expose it to a network controller.  A network controller can then
   use the instantiated topology data to compare and reconcile its own
   view of the network topology with that of the network elements that
   it controls.  Alternatively, nodes within the network could propagate
   this understanding to compare and reconcile this understanding either
   among themselves or with help of a controller.  Beyond the network
   element and the immediate context of I2RS itself, a network
   controller might even use the data model to represent its view of the
   topology that it controls and expose it to applications north of
   itself.  Further use cases that the data model can be applied to are
   described in [topology-use-cases].

3.1.  Main building blocks

   A network can contain multiple topologies.  Each topology is captured
   in its own list entry, distinguished via a topology-id.  This is
   captured by list "topology", contained underneath the root container
   for this module, "network-topology".

   A topology has a certain type, such as L2, L3, OSPF or IS-IS.  A
   topology can even have multiple types simultaneously.  The type, or
   types, are captured underneath the container "topology-types".  This

Internet-Draft  draft-clemm-i2rs-yang-network-topo-01.txt   October 2014


   container serves as container for data nodes that represent specific
   topology types.  In this module it serves merely as an augmentation
   target; topology-specific modules will later introduce new data nodes
   to represent new topology types below this target, i.e. insert them
   below "topology-types" by ways of yang augmentation.

   Topology types SHOULD always be represented using presence
   containers, not leafs of empty type.  This allows to represent
   hierarchies of topology subtypes within the instance information.
   For example, an instance of an OSPF topology (which, at the same
   time, is a layer 3 unicast IGP topology) would contain underneath
   "topology-types" another container "l3-unicast-igp-topology", which
   in turn would contain a container "ospf-topology".

   A topology can in turn be part of a hierarchy of topologies, building
   on top of other topologies.  Any such topologies are captured in the
   list "underlay-topology".

   Furthermore, a topology contains nodes and links, each captured in
   their own list.

   A node has a node-id that distinguishes the node from other nodes in
   the list.  In addition, a node has a list of termination points that
   are used to terminate links.  An example of a termination point might
   be a physical or logical port or, more generally, an interface.
   Also, a node can map onto one or more other nodes in an underlay
   topology.  This is captured in the list "supporting-node".

   A link is identified by a link-id that uniquely identifies the link
   within a given topology.  Links are point-to-point and
   unidirectional.  Accordingly, a link contains a source and a
   destination.  Both source and destination reference a corresponding
   node, as well as a termination point on that node.  Similar to a
   node, a link can map onto one or more links in an underlay topology.
   This is captured in the list "supporting-link".

3.2.  Discussion and selected design decisions

   Rather than maintaining lists in separate containers, the model is
   kept relatively flat in terms of its containment structure.
   Therefore, path specifiers used to refer to specific nodes, be it in
   management operations or in specifications of constraints, can remain
   relatively compact.  Of course, this means there is no separate
   structure in instance information that separates elements of
   different lists from one another.  Such structure is semantically not
   required, although it might enhance human readability in some cases.

Internet-Draft  draft-clemm-i2rs-yang-network-topo-01.txt   October 2014


   To minimize assumptions of what a topology might actually represent,
   mappings between topologies, nodes, links, and termination points are
   kept strictly generic.  For example, no assumptions are made whether
   a termination point actually refers to an interface, or whether a
   node refers to a specific "system" or device; the model at this
   generic level makes no provisions for that.  Any greater specifics
   about mappings between upper and lower layers can be captured in
   augmenting modules.  For example, if a termination point maps to an
   interface, an augmenting module can augment the termination point
   with a leaf that references the corresponding interface [RFC7223].
   If a node maps to a particular device or network element, an
   augmenting module can augment node with a leaf that references the
   network element.

   The model makes use of groupings, instead of simply defining data
   nodes "in-line".  This allows to more easily include the
   corresponding data nodes in notifications, which then do not need to
   respecify each data node that is to be included.  The tradeoff for
   this is that it makes the specification of constraints more complex,
   because constraints involving data nodes outside the grouping need to
   be specified in conjunction with a "uses" statement where the
   grouping is applied.  This also means that constraints and XPath-
   statements need to specified in such a way that the navigate "down"
   first and select entire sets of nodes, as opposed to being able to
   simply specify them against individual data nodes.

   The topology model includes links that are point-to-point and
   unidirectional.  It does not directly support multipoint and
   bidirectional links.  While this may appear as a limitation, it does
   keep the model simple, generic, and allows it to very easily be
   subjected applications that make use of graph algorithms.  Bi-
   directional connections can be represented through pairs of
   unidirectional links.  Multipoint networks can be represented through
   pseudo-nodes (similar to IS-IS, for example).  By introducing
   hierarchies of nodes, with nodes at one level mapping onto a set of
   other nodes at another level, and the introducing new links for nodes
   at that level, topologies with connections representing non-point-to-
   point communication patterns can be represented.

   Links are terminated by a single termination point, not sets of
   termination points.  Connections involving multihoming or link
   aggregation schemes need to be represented using multiple point-to-
   point links, then defining a link at a higher layer that is supported
   by those individual links.

   In a hierarchy of topologies, there are nodes mapping to nodes, links
   mapping to links, and termination points mapping to termination
   points.  Some of this information is redundant.  Specifically, with



Clemm, et al.            Expires April 13, 2015                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft  draft-clemm-i2rs-yang-network-topo-01.txt   October 2014


   the link-to-links mapping known, and the termination points of each
   link known, maintaining separate termination point mapping
   information is not needed but can be derived via transitive closure.
   The model does provide for the option to include this information
   explicitly, but does not allow for it to be configured to avoid the
   potential to introduce (and having to validate) corresponding
   integrity issues.

   A topology's topology types are represented using a container which
   contains a data node for each of its topology types.  A topology can
   encompass several types of topology simultaneously, hence a container
   is used instead of a case construct, with each topology type in turn
   represented by a dedicated presence container itself.  The reason for
   not simply using an empty leaf, or even simpler, do away even with
   the topology container and just use a leaf-list of topology-type
   instead, is to be able to represent "class hierarchies" of topology
   types, with one topology type refining the other.  Topology-type
   specific containers are to be defined in the topology-specific
   modules, augmenting the topology-types container.

3.3.  Open issues and items for further discussion

   YANG requires data needs to be designated as either configuration or
   operational data, but not both, yet it is important to have all
   topology information, including vertical cross-topology dependencies,
   captured in one coherent model.  In most cases topology information
   is discovered about a network; the topology is considered a property
   of the network that is reflected in the model.  That said, it is
   conceivable that certain types of topology need to also be
   configurable by an application.

   There are several alternatives in which this can be addressed.  The
   alternative chosen in this draft does not restrict topology
   information as read-only, but includes a flag that indicates for each
   topology whether it should be considered as read-only or configurable
   by applications.

   An alternative would be to designate topology list elements as read
   only.  The read-only topology list includes each topology; it is the
   complete reference.  In parallel a second topology list is
   introduced.  This list serves the purpose of being able to configure
   topologies which are then mirrored in the read-only list.  The
   configurable topology list adheres to the same structure and uses the
   same groupings as its read-only counterpart.  As most data is defined
   in those groupings, the amount of additional definitions required
   will be limited.  A configurable topology will thus be represented
   twice: once in the read-only list of all topologies, a second time in
   a configuration sandbox.

5.  Security Considerations

   The transport protocol used for sending the topology data MUST
   support authentication and SHOULD support encryption.  The data-model
   by itself does not create any security implications.
