Abstract

   This document describes RADIUS attributes for the authorization and
   service provisioning of local and remote management of embedded
   systems and other managed entities (NASes).  Specific provisions are
   made for remote management via framed management protocols, and for
   more granular levels of security and command privilege level beyond
   those included in the base RADIUS specification.  Provisions are also
   introduced for enhancing auditability of individual management
   operations.

Internet-Draft    RADIUS NAS-Management Authorization      February 2005

1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document uses terminology from RFC 2865 [RFC2865] and RFC 2866
   [RFC2866].

2.  Introduction and Rationale

   The remote management Service-Types defined in RFC 2865 [RFC2865]
   include NAS-Prompt and Admin.  Both of these services provide access
   to the interactive, ASCII-text, Command Line Interface (CLI) of the
   managed entity.  Current deployments of network equipment include in
   the managed entity non-CLI, framed-protocol forms of management, such
   as HTTP, HTTPS, and SNMP.  In addition, network devices often support
   more privilege levels for management access than the two levels
   supported by NAS-Prompt (non-privileged) and Admin (privileged).
   Some access policies may be so complex or granular that it is more
   efficient to centralize them by having an AAA server make
   authorization decisions for individual operations within management
   sessions.  To address these issues, attributes for framed management
   protocols, management protocol security levels, and management access
   privilege levels are described.

3.  Provisions for Framed Management

   Framed Management means management of an entity by means of a non-
   interactive, non-CLI-style method.  The management information is
   typically formatted in a binary or textual protocol, such as HTTP or
   SNMP.  While remote management by interactive CLI sessions are
   carried over protocols, such as Telnet, Rlogin, and SSH, these
   protocols are primarily for the delivery of terminal, or pseudo-TTY
   services.  Command Line Interface, Menu Interface, or other ASCII
   (UTF-8) terminal emulation interfaces are not considered to be Framed
   Management protocols, as used in this document.  Examples of Framed
   Management protocols include HTTP, HTTPS, and SNMP.

   To support the authorization and provisioning of Framed Management
   access to managed entities, this document introduces a new value for
   the Service-Type attribute [RFC2865], and one new attribute.  The new
   value for the Service-Type attribute is Framed-Management.  The
   definition of this service is the provisioning of remote device
   management via a Framed Management protocol, as described in this
   section.  The new attribute is Framed-Management-Protocol, the value
   of which specifies a particular protocol for use in the remote
   management session.

Internet-Draft    RADIUS NAS-Management Authorization      February 2005

4.  Provisions for Granular Management Access Rights

   One new attribute is introduced in this document in support of
   granular management access rights or command privilege levels.  The
   Management-Policy-Id attribute is used to contain the name of a
   management access rights policy of local scope.  This attribute
   functions similarly to Filter-ID.  It is a string variable containing
   policy name of local scope.  The provisioning of the rules invoked by
   application of this management policy is by means outside the scope
   of this document, such as by MIB objects.

   The local application of the Management-Policy-Id within the managed
   entity may take the form of (a) one of an enumeration of command
   privilege levels, (b) a mapping into an SNMP View Based Access
   Control Method (VACM) table [RFC3415], or (c) some other set of
   management access policy rules that is mutually understood by the
   managed entity and the remote management application.  Examples are
   given in Section 9.

   The set of policy rules controlling access within management sessions
   may be quite complex, e.g.  the administrator, Alice, may only
   execute potentially disruptive commands during her working shift;
   otherwise she may execute monitoring commands if no other
   administrator is using a particular device.  At some point in the
   spectrum of complexity, it becomes more effecient to centralize the
   control of management access.  New attributes are introduced to
   facilitate such centralization.  In particular, individual management
   operations within a session may be authorized by sending an
   Access-Request which includes a description of the requested
   operation and uses the Service-Type of "Authorize Only" defined in
   RFC 3576 [RFC3576].

5.  Provisions for Secure CLI Management Access

   To provide for the authorization and provisioning of secure Command
   Line Access management methods, one new attribute is introduced in
   this document, Non-Framed-Management-Security.  The value of this
   attributes is an enumeration of security methods that may be required
   for the provisioning of NAS-Prompt or Admin service.

6.  Provisions to Enhance Auditability

   Device configuration errors are a frequent source of network service
   outages.  In many cases, these configuration errors are caused by
   human administrators executing manual changes to device
   configurations.  These errors can be difficult to diagnose or locate.
   To facilitate auditability, all of the attributes introduced in this
   document may be used in accounting records.  In addition, the idea of

Internet-Draft    RADIUS NAS-Management Authorization      February 2005

   generating interim accounting records for management sessions which
   correlate to individual operations is introduced.  For non-framed
   management sessions, these individual operations typically correlate
   to individual command executions within the device Command Line
   Interface.

7.  New Values for Existing RADIUS Attributes

7.1  Service-Type

   This document defines one new value for an existing RADIUS attribute.
   The Service-Type attribute is defined in Section 5.6 of RFC 2865
   [RFC2865], as follows:

   This Attribute indicates the type of service the user has requested,
   or the type of service to be provided.  It MAY be used in both
   Access-Request and Access-Accept packets.

   A NAS is not required to implement all of these service types, and
   MUST treat unknown or unsupported Service-Types as though an Access-
   Reject had been received instead.

   A summary of the Service-Type Attribute format is shown below.

   The fields are transmitted from left to right.

      attribute.

      (TBA)     Framed-Management

      The semantics of the Framed-Management service are as follows:

      Framed-Management   A framed protocol session should be started
                          for a remote management user or application,
                          such as HTTP or SNMP.

8.  New RADIUS Attributes

   This document defines six new RADIUS attributes related to remote
   management authorization.

8.1  Framed-Management-Protocol

   The Framed-Management-Protocol attribute indicates the protocol to be
   used for framed management access.  It MAY be used in both Access-
   Request and Access-Accept packets.

   A summary of the Framed-Management-Protocol Attribute format is shown
   below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

         2      HTTP
         3      HTTPS/TLS

8.2  Non-Framed-Management-Security

   The Non-Framed-Management-Security attribute indicates the mandated
   security parameters of non-framed management access sessions.  It MAY
   be used in both Access-Request and Access-Accept packets.  This
   attribute is used in conjunction with, and further specifies the
   standard RADIUS Service-Type attributes of NAS-Prompt and Admin.

   A summary of the Non-Framed-Management-Security Attribute format is
   shown below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

8.3  Management-Policy-Id

   The Management-Policy-Id attribute indicates the name of the
   management access policy for this user.  Zero or more Management-
   Policy-Id attributes MAY be sent in an Access-Accept packet.
   Identifying a policy by name allows the policy to be used on
   different NASes without regard to implementation details.

   Multiple forms of management access rules may be expressed by the
   underlying named policy, the definition of which is beyond the scope
   of this document.  The management access policy MAY be applied
   contextually, based on the nature of the management access method.
   For example, some named policies may only be valid for application to
   NAS-Prompt services and some other policies may only be valid for
   application to SMNPv3 services.

   The management access policy named in this attribute, received in an
   Access-Accept packet, MUST be applied to the session authorized by
   the Access-Accept.  If the policy name is unknown, or the policy
   rules are incorrectly formatted, the NAS SHOULD treat the packet as
   if it had been an Access-Reject.

   A summary of the Management-Policy-Id Attribute format is shown
   below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

   The Text field is one or more octets, and its contents are
   implementation dependent.  It is intended to be human readable and
   MUST NOT affect operation of the protocol.  It is recommended that
   the message contain UTF-8 encoded 10646 [RFC2279] characters.

8.4  Non-Framed-Management-Command

   The Non-Framed-Management-Command attribute indicates a specific
   management operation within a NAS-Prompt or Admin session.  It MAY be
   used in Access-Request or Accounting-Request packets.  This attribute
   MUST NOT be included in packets which also include the
   Framed-Management-Operation attribute.

   When used within an Access-Request with a Service-Type value of
   "Authorize Only" (17), the NAS is requesting authorization for this
   specific management operation within an existing NAS-Prompt or Admin
   session.  When used within an Accounting-Request with an
   Acct-Status-Type value of Interim-Update (3), the NAS is reporting
   that the specific management operation has been performed.

   Typically, the text value of this attribute would equate to a single
   command issued to the embedded device's Command Line Interface.  If
   the management session is using a menu or other ASCII interface, the
   value of this attribute would contain a textual representation of the
   specific operation.

   the message contain UTF-8 encoded 10646 [RFC2279] characters.

8.5  Framed-Management-Operation

   The Framed-Management-Operation attribute indicates a specific
   management operation within a Framed-Management session.  It MAY be
   used in Access-Request or Accounting-Request packets.  This attribute
   MUST NOT be included in packets which also include the
   Non-Framed-Management-Command attribute.

   When used within an Access-Request with a Service-Type value of
   "Authorize Only" (17), the NAS is requesting authorization for this
   specific management operation within an existing Framed-Management
   session.  When used within an Accounting-Request with an
   Acct-Status-Type value of Interim-Update (3), the NAS is reporting
   that the specific management operation has been performed.

   The value of this attribute is a textual rendering of the specific
   management operation being performed, e.g.  "SNMP GET OID
   0.1.2.3...".

8.6  Management-Context

   The Management-Context attribute indicates additional contextual
   information in conjunction with the specific management operation
   indicated by either the Non-Framed-Management-Command or the
   Framed-Management-Operation attributes.  It MAY be used in
   Access-Request or Accounting-Request packets.

   When used with the Non-Framed-Management-Command attribute, the
   Management-Context attribute may be used to indicate a Command Line
   Interface mode or sub-mode, a role associated with the management
   session, or other contextual information related to the specific
   operation being performed.

10.  Diameter Translation Considerations

   The attributes defined in this document are compatible with the
   standard Diameter translation process as defined in Section 9 of
   Diameter Network Access Server Application
   [I-D.ietf-aaa-diameter-nasreq].

11.  Proxy Operation Considerations

   The device management access authorization attributes presented in
   this document present certain considerations when used in proxy
   environments.  These considerations are not different from those that
   exist in RFC 2865 [RFC2865] with respect to the Service-Type
   attribute values of Admin and NAS-Prompt.

   Most proxy environments are also multi-party environments.  In
   multi-party proxy environments it is important to distinguish which
   entities have the authority to provision management access to the
   edge devices, i.e.  NASes, and which entities only have authority to
   provision network access services of various sorts.

   It may be important that operators of the NAS are able to ensure that
   access to the CLI, or other management interfaces, of the NAS are
   only provisioned to their own employees or contractors.  One way for

Internet-Draft    RADIUS NAS-Management Authorization      February 2005

   the NAS to enforce this requirement is to use only local, non-proxy
   RADIUS servers for management access requests.  Proxy RADIUS servers
   could be used for non-management access requests, based on local
   policy.  This "bi-furcation" of RADIUS authentication and
   authorization is a simple case of separate administrative realms.
   The NAS may be designed so as to maintain separate lists of RADIUS
   servers for management AAA use and for non-management AAA use.

   An alternate method of enforcing this requirement would be for the
   first-hop proxy server, operated by the owner of the NAS, to filter
   out any RADIUS attributes that provision management access rights
   that originate from "up-stream" proxy servers not operated by the NAS
   owner.  Access-Accept messages that provision such locally
   un-authorized management access MAY be treated as if they were an
   Access-Reject by the first-hop proxy server.

   These issues are not of concern when all the RADIUS servers, local
   and proxy, used by the NAS are under the sole administrative control
   of the NAS owner.

12.  Table of Attributes

   The following table provides a guide to which attributes may be found
   in which kinds of packets, and in what quantity.

   The following table defines the meaning of the above table entries.

   0    This attribute MUST NOT be present in a packet.
   0+   Zero or more instances of this attribute MAY be present in
        a packet.
   0-1  Zero or one instance of this attribute MAY be present in
        a packet.
   1    Exactly one instance of this attribute MUST be present in
        a packet.

13.  IANA Considerations

   This document contains placeholders ("TBA") for assigned numbers
   within the RADIUS Attributes registry, to be assigned by IANA at the
   time this document should be published as an RFC.

14.  Security Considerations

   The RADIUS attributes and attribute values described in this document
   do not impose any additional security considerations beyond those
   documented in the existing RADIUS specification [RFC2865].
