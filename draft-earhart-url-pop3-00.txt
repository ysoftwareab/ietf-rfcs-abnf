Status of this Memo

   This document is an Internet-Draft.  Internet-Drafts are working
   documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its areas,
   and its working groups.  Note that other groups may also distribute
   working documents as Internet-Drafts.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
   months.  and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other
   documents at any time.  It is not appropriate to use Internet-Drafts
   as reference material or to cite them other than as "work in
   progress".

   To learn the current status of any Internet-Draft, please check the

   munnari.oz.au (Pacific Rim), ds.internic.net (US East Coast), or
   ftp.isi.edu (US West Coast).

   This document suggests a proposed protocol for the Internet
   community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
   Distribution of this draft is unlimited.

   The protocol discussed in this document is experimental and subject
   to change.  Persons planning on either implementing or using this
   protocol are STRONGLY URGED to get in touch with the author before
   embarking on such a project.


Abstract

   It is occasionally useful to be able to reference a generic server to
   be used for message submission.  URLs provide a good mechanism for
   refering to arbitrary network resources.  The POP3 URL scheme allows
   a URL to specify a POP3 [POP3] server, allowing other protocols to
   use a general ''URL to be used for mail access'' in place of an
   explicit reference to POP3.

1.   Conventions Used in this Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].


2.   POP3 URL Scheme

   The POP3 URL follows the common Internet scheme syntax as defined in
   [BASIC-URL] except that plaintext passwords are not permitted.  If
   :<port> is omitted, the port defaults to 110.

   The specified server should not be assumed to have any services
   available other than POP3.  Other than authentication, no protocol
   actions are implied by an POP3 URL; a POP3 URL only specifies the
   location of a POP3 service, not what to do with it (common actions
   are to use the service to discover whether a user has pending mail,
   and to retrieve such mail).

   A POP3 URL has the following general form:

      url-pop3  = "pop3://" url-server

   "pop3" refers to the URL scheme; "://" is used to indicate a
   reference to an Internet host address.  The <url-server> element
   includes the hostname, and optional user name, authentication
   mechanism and port number.

   Note that unsafe or reserved characters such as " " or "?" MUST be
   hex encoded as described in the URL specification [BASIC-URL].  Hex
   encoded octets are interpreted according to UTF-8 [UTF8].


3.   POP3 URL User Name and Authentication Mechanism

   A user name and/or authentication mechanism may be supplied.  They
   are used to perform authentication, as per [POP3-AUTH], after making
   the connection to the POP3 server.  If no user name or authentication
   mechanism is supplied, then clients SHOULD try known authentication
   mechanisms in order of decreasing strength, as permitted by the user.
   If an authentication mechanism is supplied without a user name, then
   one SHOULD be obtained from the specified mechanism or requested from
   the user as appropriate.  If a user name is supplied without an
   authentication mechanism then ";AUTH=*" is assumed.

   The ";AUTH=" authentication parameter is interpreted as described in
   the IMAP URL Scheme [IMAP-URL].

   Note that if unsafe or reserved characters such as " " or ";" are
   present in the user name or authentication mechanism, they MUST be
   encoded as described in the URL specification [BASIC-URL].


4.   Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) notation as specified in [ABNF].  This uses the ABNF core
   rules as specified in Appendix A of the ABNF specification [ABNF].

   Except as noted otherwise, all alphabetic characters are case-
   insensitive.  The use of upper or lower case characters to define
   token strings is for editorial clarity only.  Implementations MUST
   accept these strings in a case-insensitive fashion.

      url-auth           = ";AUTH=" ("*" / url-enc-auth)

      url-achar          = uchar / "&" / "=" / "~"
                           ;; See [BASIC-URL] for definition of "uchar"

      url-enc-auth       = 1*url-achar
                           ;; encoded version of auth-type-name above

      url-enc-user       = *url-achar
                           ;; encoded version of login userid

      url-pop3           = "pop3://" url-server

      url-server         = [url-enc-user [url-auth] "@"] hostport
                           ;; See [BASIC-URL] for definition of "hostport"


5.   Security Considerations

   POP3 URLs have the same security considerations as IMAP URLs [IMAP-
   URL].

   Clients SHOULD make the POP3 URL being used obvious to the user, as
   using an undesireable server may compromise the user's idea of what
   mail has been recieved.  Clients SHOULD only use reasonably strong
   AUTHorization mechanisms, to ensure the privacy and integrity of the
   user's mail while in transit.
