Abstract

   This document specifies a means to integrate Certificate Management
   Service for The Session Initiation Protocol(SIP) with presence.
   Presentities employing the Presence Information Data Format (PIDF)
   can use the extensions in this draft to advertise their ability to
   exchange signalling using S/MIME, and thus allow secure signalling
   between the two peers.  In a presence application, the presence of
   this information could be displayed to watchers as the padlock
   "secure signalling available" of the presentity.

1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119[1].


2.  Introduction

   Certificate Management Service for The Session Initiation
   Protocol(SIP) [6] [4] is a mechanism that provides a way to address
   discovery, retrieval, and management of certificates for SIP
   deployments and provide a way for SIP entities to exchange signalling
   using S/MIME [5] a reality.

   Presence [2] information depicts the status and disposition of a
   presentity towards a particular watcher.  It encompasses availability
   on the network, attitude towards communication, and to some degree
   application capability.

   Accordingly, this specification provides a means for presence to
   communicate a presentity's capability to signal using S/MIME prior to
   any session establishment.  This mechanism communicates a
   presentity's ability to receive signalling using S/MIME by extending
   the Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) , a document format for
   transmitting presence information.


3.  The 'certs' Presence Capability

   This specification extends the Presence Capabilities (or 'prescaps')
   framework [3] for PIDF with a new element called 'certs'.Transmission
   of the 'certs' stanza in a PIDF presence notification communicate the
   presentity's ability to signal using S/MIME.

   Below, we describe the 'certs' element in detail.  The optional
   attribute of 'src' indicates the location of the certificate, the
   value of this attribute MUST be URI starting with the schema used.
   Schema MUST be one of "sips:", "sip:", "http:" or "https:".

   If the schema in 'src' is either "sips:" or "sip:" wathcer MUST
   follow section 6 of Certificate Management Service for The Session
   Initiation Protocol(SIP) to obtain the certificate with an exception
   to use the URI presented in the 'src' attribute instead of the
   AoR.(URI may be of GRUU etc.)

   The absence of 'src' attributes indicates that a watcher interested
   in obtaining the certificate MUST follow the section 6 of Certificate
