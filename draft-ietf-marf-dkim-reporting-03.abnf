r= Reporting Address (plain-text; OPTIONAL; no default).  The value
      MUST be a dkim-quoted-printable string containing an e-mail
      address to which a report SHOULD be sent when mail signed with
      this key fails verification because either (a) the signature
      verification itself failed, or (b) the body hash test failed.  The
      format of this reply is selected by the value of the "rf=" tag,
      defined below.  The value MUST be interpreted as a local-part
      only.  To construct the actual address to which the report is
      sent, the verifier simply appends to this value an "@" followed by
      the domain found in the "d=" tag of the signature whose validation
      failed.

rf=  Reporting Format (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is "arf").  The
      value MUST be a colon-separated list of tokens representing
      desired reporting formats in order of preference.  Each element of
      the list MUST be a token that is taken from the registered list of
      report formats.  See Section 7 for a description of the registry
      and Section 6 for a description of recognized formats.  The
      verifier generating reports MUST generate a report using the first
      token in the list that represents a report format it is capable of
      generating.

ri=  Requested Report Interval (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is
      "0").  The value is an unsigned 32-bit integer that specifies an
      interval during which the report generator SHOULD NOT issue more
      than one report about a given incident type.  A value of "0"
      requests a report for every incident; a value of "1" requests a
      report for every other incident; etc.  Where the requested
      interval is not zero, the agent generating a report SHOULD include
      an "Incidents:" field in the generated report so the receiving
      agent has some indication of how many reports were suppressed.

      ABNF:

key-ri-tag = %x72 %x69 *WSP "=" *WSP 1*DIGIT

ro=  Requested Reports (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is "all").  The

      conditions under which a report is desired.  See Section 5.1 for a
      list of valid tags.

r= Reporting Address (plain-text; OPTIONAL; no default).  The value
      MUST be a dkim-quoted-printable string containing an e-mail
      address to which a report SHOULD be sent when mail claiming to be
      from this domain failed the verification algorithm described in
      [ADSP], in particular because a message arrived without a
      signature that validates, which contradicts what the ADSP record
      claims, the format of this reply MUST be in the format specified
      by the "rf=" tag, defined below.  The value MUST be interpreted as
      a local-part only.  To construct the actual address to which the
      report is sent, the verifier simply appends to this value an "@"
      followed by the domain whose policy was queried in order to
      evaluate the sender's ADSP, i.e., the one taken from the
      RFC5322.From domain of the message under evaluation.

      registered list of DKIM report formats.  See Section 7 for a
      description of the registry and Section 6 for a description of
