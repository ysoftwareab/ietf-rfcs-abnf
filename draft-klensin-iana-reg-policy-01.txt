Abstract

   For many years, the IETF has maintained, via the IANA, registries of
   protocol and parameter names and numbers.  The primary purpose of
   these registries is to ensure that different methods and options are
   properly identified and distinguished.  Registration of such names or
   numbers generally does not necessarily imply approval of the

   technology in the corresponding protocol.  Instead, registration
   represents the desire to keep choices distinctly identified,
   separated, and public to avoid conflicts in use.  In recent years,
   various changes in the nature of the instructions given to the IANA,
   increased perceptions of scarcity in the number spaces associated
   with some of the parameters, and other issues have led to a shift in
   emphasis from "registration to keep identifiers unique" toward
   evaluations of the quality of proposals for and preferences among
   protocols.  This document argues that shift is undesirable.  It
   articulates and clarifies the principles that the reasons for
   evaluation of registration requests is to ensure a minimum quality of
   definition, that any assertions of scarcity to restrict registrations
   must be accompanied by a plan for evaluating and, if appropriate,
   eliminating the scarcity problem, and that, if a "no scarcity" plan
   is not possible, to establish criteria for making decisions that are
   as specific and objective as possible.

   This document is intended to update the general considerations of RFC
   2434, the specific allocation rules of RFC 2780, and the evaluation
   criteria associated with other documents that condition an IANA
   registration on Expert Review with IESG oversight or on IESG or IETF
   action.

Internet-Draft            Registration Policies                July 2005


1.  Introduction

   For many years, the IETF has maintained, via the IANA registries of
   protocol and parameter names and numbers.  The original purpose of
   these registries was to ensure that different methods and options are
   properly identified and distinguished.  Registration did not imply
   approval of the technology in the corresponding protocol.  Instead,
   registration represented only the desire to keep distinct options
   identified, separated, and public to avoid conflicts.

   In recent years, the previous very general instructions to the IANA
   about registrations have been superceded by the inclusion of specific
   instructions in RFCs that define IETF protocols.  These instructions
   have included rules for the establishment of the relevant registries
   themselves and details on how requests should be submitted, and new
   values defined, for any paramaters defined by the RFC.  In addition a
   number of RFCs have been produced to provide instructions for IETF
   protocols that were defined before such instructions began to be
   included.  Examples of those RFCs containing registration
   instructions include [RFC2780], [RFC2939], [RFC3171], [RFC3228],
   [RFC3383], [RFC3438], [RFC3474], [RFC3475], [RFC3476], [RFC3575],
   [RFC3737], [RFC3818], [RFC3968], and [RFC3969].  These instructions,
   coupled with increased perceptions of scarcity in the number spaces
   associated with some parameters, have led to a shift in emphasis from
   "registration to keep identifiers unique" and toward evaluations of
   the quality of proposals and preferences about protocol design.

   The distinction between requiring clarity and lack of obvious
   conflict in a registration and blocking one unless the quality of the
   underlying protocol was adequate was, in retrospect, further confused
   by [RFC2434] (which describes elements of the registration model) in
   different places, as

   o  "To insure that such quantities have consistent values and
      interpretations in different implementations, their assignment
      must be administered by a central authority." (abstract, repeated
      in first paragraph of section 1)
   o  "... preferred way of insuring review, and is particularly
      important if any potential interoperability issues can arise.
      [...]  A new option may define fields that need to be parsed and
      acted on, which (if specified poorly) may not fit cleanly with the
      architecture of other options or the base protocols on which they
      are built." (section 2)
   o  "Even when the space is essentially unlimited, however, it is
      usually desirable to have a minimal review to prevent the hoarding
      of or unnecessary wasting of a space." (section 2)

Internet-Draft            Registration Policies                July 2005


   RFC 2434 was used as the primary guideline for the RFCs listed above
   that define IANA considerations for particular protocols.  All three
   of the above statements are consistent with other text in RFC 2434,
   but the intent of the review is left open.  In other words, it
   specifies how a review is to be performed, but not the criteria to be
   used.  The present document argues that the apparent recent shift
   from "evaluate a registration request for clarity and to avoid
   interoperability problems" is undesirable and explicitly sets out
   evaluation principles for registrations.  While it may be completely
   reasonable to require some specific level of approval of a protocol
   with an associated parameter value, especially when the specification
   for that allocation explicitly designates IETF approval and
   endorsement (see Section 4), this should not be used as a
   justification to require "approval" of registrations in general.  For
   registrations, the principal reasons for review are to ensure
   adequate quality in the definitions to permit interoperability, to
   avoid redundant or spurious registrations, and to provide those who
   request the registrations an opportunity for non-binding IETF
   community advice on the nature of the parameters being proposed for
   registration or the protocol elements associated with them.  A
   secondary, but still important, reason involves verification that the
   proposed protocol does not contain elements that are likely to cause
   serious harm to the Internet.  However, the threshold for rejecting a
   registration on the basis of "serious harm" should be very high and
   represent broad and obvious community consensus.  This is the case
   first because there might otherwise be suspicion that a claim of harm
   was being used to try to block an unpopular protocol or to give a
   favored one some advantage.  Second, from a registration standpoint,
   the best way to handle a dangerous protocol may be to give it clear
   and distinct parameter values so its effects can be easily and
   accurately identified and quarantined.

   It should also be clear from experience with Peer-to-Peer protocols
   and other that the IETF does not and cannot control introduction and
   use of "non-standard" protocols.  So registration is in some sense
   only a courtesy to the community.  P2P protocols freely violate norms
   on the use of particular protocol identifiers and parameters but
   since the software often has but a single source, there is no
   confusion FOR THOSE INSTANCES of the software that comes from the
   same source and uses the same "conventions" albeit non-standard and
   even conflicting with standards.

   This document articulates and clarifies the principles that (i) the
   reasons for evaluation of registration requests is to ensure a
   minimum quality of definition, (ii) any assertion of a danger to the
   Internet or to the stable operation of other protocols (especially
   IETF Standards Track ones) must by supported by a public discussion
   to which all relevant parties can contribute, and (iii) that any



Klensin, et al.         Expires January 18, 2006                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft            Registration Policies                July 2005


   assertions of scarcity to restrict registrations MUST be accompanied
   by a plan for eliminating the scarcity problem or a conclusion,
   supported by IETF consensus, that it is not possible to do so and a
   corresponding rationing plan for the remaining space.  These
   principles derive from the assumption that growth and innovation on
   the Internet continue to be core values of the IETF and the Internet
   community.

   In summary, unless the "scarcity" rules of Section 3 apply, this
   document updates all "IANA registration" documents and "IANA
   considerations" sections of documents to clarify the point that
   registration review is to focus on the issues above, rather than on
   concerns about, e.g., whether one protocol approach is better than
   another one.

2.  Registration Principle: Clarity of Definition

   By longstanding IANA tradition, almost all protocol number or
   parameter registrations must be associated with a description of what
   the parameter represents.  As mentioned in RFC 2434, while those
   descriptions are normally public, the IETF and IANA have sometimes
   made provisions for non-public definitions.  But, in all cases, the
   definitions must be sufficiently clear to avoid any interoperability
   problems.  Over the years, IANA has regularly sent registration
   requests back to the originator for clarification.  Today, part of
   the purpose of review of registration requests in the IETF is to make
   determinations about whether an appropriate level of clarity has been
   achieved and about whether the documentation supplied is adequate.

3.  Registration Principle: Allocating Scarcity

   As suggested in section 2 of [RFC2434], the size of a name space in
   which parameters are to be allocated determines whether care must be
   taken "to insure that the space doesn't become exhausted".  However,
   that level of care MUST NOT be interpreted or implemented in an
   attempt to apply a single standard of taste or style to the Internet
   or otherwise as a mechanism for attempting to suppress innovation.  A
   limited space requires diligent evaluation of requests to avoid
   spurious or vanity registrations and unnecessary ones, including
   registrations that are unlikely to ever be used.  However, unless
   extraordinary circumstances arise, such evaluation must be carried
   out on the assumption that the size of the name space is, and will
   remain, adequate for all legitimate registrations of values that will
   be used with the associated protocols.

3.1  Scarcity in Parameter Spaces

   The size requirements for a particular name space may occasionally be



Klensin, et al.         Expires January 18, 2006                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft            Registration Policies                July 2005


   underestimated, creating a requirement to minimize allocations and
   registrations in that particular name space to avoid a clear danger
   of running out of the space.  If that situation arises for a
   particular name space, and its existence is confirmed by the IESG
   after an IETF review and Last Call as described in [RFC2026], then
   new registrations may be temporarily restricted to those required to
   meet the needs of IETF protocol development.  However, such
   restrictions MUST NOT be applied without initiation of a plan to
   evaluate and, if appropriate, eliminate the scarcity, as discussed in
   the next subsection.

3.2  Scaling and Scarcity Reduction

   Difficulties with scaling are always a significant risk factor on the
   Internet, with regard to both protocol design and administrative
   procedures.  When a parameter field is of fixed length, estimates
   must be made, sometimes under considerable uncertainty and with high
   costs associated with incremental size, as to how much parameter
   capacity is needed.  If such an estimate is incorrect and a
   significant danger arises of running out of space, "conservation",
   i.e., restrictions on registrations or allocations to save space,
   will delay the date on which no further space is available, but will
   not eliminate the risk of that occurring.  Because of the damaging
   effects on Internet innovation of rejecting otherwise-legitimate
   registrations because of name space exhaustion, a decision that a
   name space is facing a capacity crisis MUST BE made explicitly by the
   community, as outlined above, and MUST BE associated with a plan to
   expand the relevant name space unless that is deemed to be infeasible
   (see below).  A plan to expand the name space MAY take the form of
   chartering a Working Group or creating an IAB workshop to develop a
   plan within an appropriate time, or other approaches may be used.

   A determination that the expansion of a name space is infeasible MUST
   include criteria for making allocations in the balance of the
   existing space and those criteria must be fair and balanced.  The
   determination of infeasibility and the allocation plan MUST represent
   the consensus of the IETF community, determined through the same
   mechanisms used to approve a document as a BCP (see [RFC2026]).

   It is the explicit intent of this specification that registration
   requests not be rejected for reasons of name space shortages unless
   either an effort has been initiated to eliminate the shortage or a
   formal determination has been made by the community that it is
   infeasible or undesirable to do so.  Nothing in this document should
   be taken as requiring that every limited name space must be expanded,
   only that careful consideration of what to do about the scarcity
   situation be initiated, and initiated in a way that is visible and
   accessible for community participation, immediately upon a

Internet-Draft            Registration Policies                July 2005


   determination of scarcity and that the consideration process be
   diligently pursued until some consensus conclusion is reached.

3.3  Legitimacy of Registration Requests

   [[Note in Draft: This subsection is temporary.]]

   Obviously, it must be possible for the IANA and the registration
   evaluation process to protect against denial of service attacks by
   virtue of a perpetrator registering as many parameters as possible so
   as to exhaust the address space.  Since that issue exists whether or
   not this specification is accepted, it should be addressed generally
   in RFC 2434bis and more specifically in individual registry
   specification documents or sections.  See Section 6.

4.  Multiple category or arc registrations

   In a number of cases, registration procedures or protocols have
   provided for registrations in a number of different categories, where
   those categories are associated with different levels of requirements
   for registration but where interoperability may be achieved by the
   use of any of the categories.  Examples of this approach include the
   distinction between "user" and "system" port numbers most recently
   described in [RFC2780] and the distinctions among the various
   registration arcs for media type registrations described in
   [RFC2048].

   A decision by the IESG or other designated party to require that a
   registration be made in a different arc or subsidiary name space than
   was proposed is not to be considered a rejection of the registration
   request under the terms of this document.

5.  Interpretation of Requirements for IESG Review or Standards Action

   A requirement for IESG approval, Standards Action, or RFC Publication
   implies that IESG approval is an acceptable alternative to the other
   two, not an exceptional case unless the requirement contains
   additional provisions specifying the conditions for IESG review and
   approval.  Because, for reasons discussed above, the action on a
   registration request SHOULD BE to permit the registration unless
   special circumstances apply, the IESG MUST NOT deny a registration
   request for other than reasons of clarity without an IETF Last Call
   and IETF consensus that the rejection is appropriate for identified
   reasons consistent with those discussed in this document.  If a
   registration request is denied for any reason, that reason must be
   stated explicitly and the decision may be appealed under the
   procedures specified in [RFC2026] or its successor(s).

Internet-Draft            Registration Policies                July 2005


   Inevitably, almost any of the procedures discussed above or in RFC
   2434, may result in delays as the application is evaluated.  In the
   spirit of community comment, input, and consensus, feedback to those
   requesting an allocation is desirable and is to be encouraged.
   Registration delays while such discussions are ongoing are entirely
   appropriate as long as they do not cause unreasonable delays once the
   feedback and discussion processes runs their effective course.  Of
   course, nothing in this document prevents an applicant from
   voluntarily withdrawing a registration request at any time that is
   deemed appropriate.

6.  Reflections on 2434bis

   A revision of RFC 2434, known as [RFC2434bis] is being developed.
   This section discusses some important interactions between the model
   of that document and the one presented here.

6.1  Designated Experts

   2434bis is fairly non-specific about the amount of authority that is
   reasonably delegated and for what purposes.  This document takes the
   position that individual decisions, taken out the view of the
   community, should be significantly constrained with regard to both
   subject matter and process.  In particular, designated experts are
   seen as appropriate as managers of discussion and feedback and to
   evaluate clarity of a specification and not as a decision focus on
   the appropriateness of a protocol or registration request.  An
   exception might be made when the expert is given specific guidance
   from the community, but this document views even that as a high-risk
   situation.

   More generally, designated experts are appropriate only in situations
   in which it is reasonable to assume that feedback --on both the
   registration and the underlying protocol is sought by those who
   request the registration and where that feedback is seen by all
   parties as an important part of the process.  As one example, a
   designated expert may be an appropriate source or channel of advice
   to both the requester and other other review bodies on the clarity of
   a specification.

   The designation and use of such experts is not appropriate for
   registries that are, or are likely to be, associated with significant
   controversy (of which declared scarcity is almost always an
   instance).  When controversies about registrations exist or can be
   anticipated, an open, public process with community involvement and
   practical opportunity for timely appeals is almost always more
   appropriate.

Internet-Draft            Registration Policies                July 2005


6.2  Override Procedure

   RFC2434bis-02 contains provisions for an override procedure in
   section 4.3.  The position of this document is that, while such
   procedures may be necessary and appropriate, they should be exposed
   to full view of the community so that timely feedback and, if
   necessary, appeal is possible.  Consequently, if the override
   procedure is invoked, the IESG should notify the community that it is
   being done and, unless the situation involves severe time
   constraints, at least a brief Last Call or other request for
   community comments should be conducted on the proposed action.

6.3  Denial of Service Attacks

   At least in principle, it is possible to attack any registry by
   attempting massive registration of names or parameters so as to use
   up all of the available space. 2434bis should address this issue, at
   least to the extent of recommending that specifications that
   establish registries advise on how such attacks are to be repelled
   for those registries.

6.4  Appeals

   RFC 2434bis prohibits appeals beyond the IAB.  There appears to be
   little or no justification for barring such appeals if a claim is
   made that the procedures are flawed or inadequate.

7.  Internationalization Considerations

   This document specifies IETF procedures and does not interact with
   internationalization.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document specifies IETF and IESG considerations in recommending
   actions to IANA.  It recommends that, when the IETF concludes that
   the protocol, extension, or option associated with a registration
   request is problematic or dangerous, the entry in the IANA registry
   should be annotated to identify the concern and, when appropriate,
   point to documentation or other materials that will better explain
   the concern or alternatives that might be less problematic.  While
   this document specifies no particular registry actions for IANA, IANA
   should be prepared for requests from the IETF to annotate registry
   entries in that way.

9.  Security considerations

   This document specifies IETF procedures.  It should have no direct

   impact on Internet security.  It does, however, firmly advocate the
   principle that it is preferable for options or extensions that could
   pose security or operational risks to be throughly documented and
   carefully identified in preference to hiding them and hoping that
   they will disappear.

   Changes from -00.

   1.  Added new material to discuss impact with and on RFC2434bis as
       Section 6
   2.  Made several small changes to clarify that name space expansion
       is not a requirement, only that serious consideration of the
       issue be initiated as soon as scarcity is noted.
   3.  Made several small changes to clarify that delays in registration
       to obtain feedback and to discuss the registration with the
       requestor and the community are appropriate as long as they are
       not unreasonably prolonged.
