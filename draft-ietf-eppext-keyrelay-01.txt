        Relay Extension for the Extensible Provisioning Protocol
                     draft-ietf-eppext-keyrelay-01

Abstract

   This document describes a generic Extensible Provisioning Protocol
   (EPP) extension for the purpose of relaying data between registrars.

   Furthermore, this document describes a specific implementation for
   relaying DNSSEC key material between DNS operators (by means of their
   respective registrars), to facilitate the change of DNS operator,
   while keeping the DNSSEC chain of trust intact.

   This I-D introduces a new generic command <relay> and an element
   <relayData>.  For the specific implementation of relaying DNSSEC key
   material it introduces an extension of the <relayData> with a
   <keyRelayData> element.

Internet-Draft                  EPP Relay                   January 2015


1.  Introduction

   There are certain transactions in the lifecycle of a domain name,
   that require interaction between registrars but need registration
   data from the registry.  Since all registrars involved have a secure
   channel to the registry for maintaining the delegation, the registry
   can act as relay for such data to transfer securely and authoritative
   between the registrars involved.

   Currently these transactions aren't supported in the Extensible
   Provisioning Protocol (EPP) [RFC5730].  One example of such a
   transaction is the exchange of DNSSEC key material to keep the DNSSEC
   chain of trust intact in case of a change of DNS-operator.

   In this document we will define:

   o  A protocol extension that implements the relaying of data between
      registrars through the existing authenticated EPP channel.  This
      protocol extension introduces a new EPP command called <relay>
      with an element <relayData>.

   o  An extension to the <relayData> element called <keyRelayData> that
      can be used for the relaying DNSSEC key material using the <relay>
      command.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

   XML is case sensitive.  Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
   and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
   character case presented in order to develop a conforming
   implementation.

   In examples, "C:" represents lines sent by a protocol client, and
   "S:" represents lines returned by a protocol server.  Indentation and
   white space in examples is provided only to illustrate element
   relationships and is not a mandatory feature of this protocol.

1.2.  Relaying Data

   The <relay> command uses the existing authenticated EPP channel
   between the registrar and the registry.  Registrars can use this
   secure channel for relaying data to other registrars.  The registry
   serves as an intermediary between two registrars (see Figure 1).

                  +-------------+  relayData  +-------------+
                  | registrar X |~~~~~~~~~~~~>| registrar Y |

                         |                           ^
                         | EPP relay        EPP poll |
                         v                           |
                        +-----------------------------+
                        |           registry          |
                        +-----------------------------+

   Figure 1: Registry acting as a relay for secure data exchange between
                                registrars.

   The <relay> command uploads data from a registrar X to the registry.
   The uploaded data is then pushed onto the message queue of registrar
   Y by the registry based on the information within the <relayData>
   element of the <relay> command and the registration data maintained
   by the registry.

   The data to be relayed MUST relate to registration data of the
   registry.  The <relay> command is not intended to relay data that has
   no relationship to registration data.  We have e-mail for that.

   If for some reason the registry cannot process the <relay> command,
   an EPP error response MUST be returned.  If the registry does process
   the <relay> command it MUST put all elements of <relayData> on to the
   message queue of registrar Y.

1.2.1.  Rationale For a New Command

   This new <relay> command can be best described as a "transient
   command" as it only facilitates communication of data between two
   registrars without changing the registration data at the registry.
   No existing EPP command can be (re)used for this function.  This
   extension of EPP is in accordance to [RFC3735].

1.2.2.  Extending <relayData> per use case

   One MUST extend the <relayData> element per use case to define the
   data to be relayed.  In the extension, one MUST make provisions for
   the registry how to determine the receiving registrar of the <relay>
   command.

1.3.  Secure Transfer of DNSSEC Key Material

   Exchanging DNSSEC key material in preparation of a domain name
   transfer is one of the phases in the lifecycle of a domain name
   [I-D.koch-dnsop-dnssec-operator-change].

   DNS-operators need to exchange (through the gaining registrar) DNSSEC
   key material before the registration data can be changed.

           +--------------------+  DNSKEY   +---------------------+
           |gaining DNS operator| ~~~~~~~~> | losing DNS operator |
           +--------------------+           +---------------------+
                          |                   ^
                          |                   |
                          V                   |
           +--------------------+         +---------------------+
           |  gaining registrar |         | registrar of record |
           +--------------------+         +---------------------+
                          |                   ^
                EPP relay |                   | EPP poll
                          V                   |
                     +-----------------------------+
                     |           registry          |
                     +-----------------------------+

                Figure 2: Transfer of DNSSEC key material.

   As the <relay> command uses a secure channel, it can be used as a
   method for exchanging this DNSSEC key material securely (see
   Figure 2).

   The gaining and losing DNS operators could talk directly to each
   other (the ~ arrow) to exchange the DNSKEY, but often there is no
   trusted path between the two.  As both can securely interact with the
   registry over the administrative channel through the registrar, the
   registry can act as a relay for the key material exchange.

   This I-D contains an extension of the <relayData> element for this
   use case.

2.  Object Attributes

2.1.  DNSSEC Key Material

   To transfer DNSSEC key material with the <relay> command the generic
   <relayData> is extended with a <keyRelayData> element that contains
   the data for relaying the key material.  See Section 1.2.2.

   This <keyRelayData> element REQUIRES a minimum of three child
   elements:

   o  A <name> element which contains the domain name for which we
      upload the key.  The registry MUST relay the <keyRelayData> to the
      registrar of record of the provided domain name.

Internet-Draft                  EPP Relay                   January 2015


   o  One or more <keyData> elements that contains the DNSSEC key
      material as described in [RFC5910], Section 4.2.

   o  An <authInfo> element that contains an authorization token
      ([RFC5731], Section 3.2.1).  This indicates that the registrar has
      authorization from the registrant to change the zone data, and a
      possible future transfer is authorized.  The registry MAY check if
      the <authInfo> data is correct and if it does, it MUST return an
      EPP error response if the authorization token is not correct.

   And an OPTIONAL <expiry> child element.

   o  An <expiry> element that describes the expected lifetime of the
      relayed key(s) in the zone.  The losing DNS operator can use this
      as an indication when to safely remove the inserted key material
      from the zone.  This may be because the transaction that needed
      the insertion is either completed or has been abandoned if not
      completed before this expire time.  The <expiry> element MUST
      contain one of the following child elements:

      *  <absolute/>: The policy is valid from the current date and time
         until it expires on the specified date and time.

      *  <relative/>: The policy is valid from the current date and time
         until the end of the specified duration.

3.  EPP Command Mapping

3.1.  EPP Transient Commands

3.1.1.  EPP <relay> Command

   The EPP <relay> command is a generic EPP command used for relaying
   data between registrars.  It contains the data to be relayed and the
   client transaction identifier.  It has been designed to be extensible
   for usage in other use-cases.

   The <relay> command REQUIRES the following child elements:

   o  One or more <relayData> elements containing data to be relayed.

   o  An OPTIONAL <clTRID> (client transaction identifier) element that
      MAY be used to uniquely identify the command to the registrar.
      See [RFC5730], Section 2.5.

   Example <relay> command:

3.2.  EPP Query Commands

   This EPP extension does not change any command other than the EPP
   <poll> command response.

3.2.1.  EPP <poll> command

   This extension adds elements to the response to a <poll> command with
   the "op" attribute set to "req".  Specifically, a <panData> element
   is added to the <resData> section of the service message, containing
   the following elements:

   o  A REQUIRED <relayData> element that contains the relayed data.

   o  A REQUIRED <paDate> element that contains the date and time of the
      submitted <relay> command.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document uses URNs to describe XML namespaces and XML schemas
   conforming to a registry mechanism described in RFC3688 [RFC3688].

   Four URI assignments must be completed by the IANA.

   Registration request for the extension namespaces:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:keyrelay-1.0
   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:relay-1.0

   Registrant Contact: IESG

   XML: None.  Namespace URIs do not represent an XML specification.

   Registration request for the extension XML schemas:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:keyrelay-1.0
   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:relay-1.0

   Registrant Contact: IESG

   XML: See the "Formal Syntax" section of this document.

6.  Security Considerations

   A registry MUST NOT perform any transformation on registration data
   under registry management when processing a <relay> command.

   Any registrar can use this mechanism to put data on the message queue
   of another registrar, allowing for the potential of a denial of
   service attack.  However this can, and SHOULD be detected by the
   registry.  A registry MAY set a server policy which limits or rejects
   <relay> messages if it detects the mechanism is being abused.

   For the <keyRelayData> data a correct <authInfo> element SHOULD be
   used as an indication that putting the key material on the
   registrar's message queue is authorized by the _registrant_ of that
   domain name.  This draft does not specify how this <authInfo> is
   provided to the registrar.  This depends on how the DNS operator is
   authorised to perform DNS changes on behalf of the registrant through
   the registrar on record.  This authorisation is not covered in this
   I-D.
