               draft-haynes-sacm-oval-variables-model-01

Abstract

   This document specifies Version 5.11.1 of the OVAL Variables Model
   which contains constructs that allow for the specification of values
   for external_variables defined in content that was created using the
   OVAL Definitions Model.  The OVAL Variables Model serves as a useful
   mechanism for parameterizing content based on the OVAL Definitions
   Model.

1.  Introduction

   The Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) [OVAL-WEBSITE]
   is an international, information security community effort to
   standardize how to assess and report upon the machine state of
   systems.  For over ten years, OVAL has been developed in
   collaboration with any and all interested parties to promote open and
   publicly available security content and to standardize the
   representation of this information across the entire spectrum of
   security tools and services.

   OVAL provides an established framework for making assertions about an
   system's state by standardizing the three main steps of the
   assessment process: representing the current machine state; analyzing
   the system for the presence of the specified machine state; and
   representing the results of the assessment which facilitates
   collaboration and information sharing among the information security
   community and interoperability among tools.

   This draft is part of the OVAL contribution to the IETF SACM WG that
   standardizes the representation used to analyze a system for the
   presence of a specific machine state.  It is intended to serve as a
   starting point for the endpoint posture assessment data modeling

   Evaluation Guidance.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  oval_variables

   The oval_variables type defines the base structure in the OVAL
   Variables Model for representing a collection of OVAL Variables and
   their associated values.  This container type adds metadata about the
   origin of the content and allows for a signature.

9.  Security Considerations

   While OVAL is just a set of data models and does not directly
   introduce security concerns, it does provide a mechanism by which to
   represent endpoint posture assessment information.  This information
   could be extremely valuable to an attacker allowing them to learn
   about very sensitive information including, but, not limited to:
   security policies, systems on the network, criticality of systems,
   software and hardware inventory, patch levels, user accounts and much
   more.  To address this concern, all endpoint posture assessment
   information should be protected while in transit and at rest.
   Furthermore, it should only be shared with parties that are
   authorized to receive it.

   Another possible security concern is due to the fact that content
   expressed as OVAL has the ability to impact how a security tool
   operates.  For example, content may instruct a tool to collect
   certain information off a system or may be used to drive follow-up
   actions like remediation.  As a result, it is important for security
   tools to ensure that they are obtaining OVAL content from a trusted
   source, that it has not been modified in transit, and that proper
   validation is performed in order to ensure it does not contain
   malicious data.
