Internet-Draft         P2MP LSP Egress Protection          November 2013


1.  Introduction

   RFC 4090 describes two methods for protecting the transit nodes of a
   P2P LSP: one-to-one protection and facility bypass protection.  RFC
   4875 specifies how to use them to protect the transit nodes of a P2MP
   LSP.  However, there is no mention of locally protecting any egress
   of a protected P2P or P2MP LSP in these RFCs.

   To protect the egresses of an LSP (P2P or P2MP), an existing approach
   sets up a backup LSP from a backup ingress (or the ingress of the
   LSP) to the backup egresses, where each egress is paired with a
   backup egress and protected by the backup egress.

   The main disadvantage of this approach is that more network resources
   such as double bandwidths may be used.

   This document specifies extensions to RSVP-TE for locally protecting
   an egress of a P2MP or P2P LSP, which overcome this disadvantage.

1.1.  An Example of Egress Local Protection

   Figure 1 illustrates an example of using backup LSPs to locally
   protect egress nodes of a primary P2MP LSP, which is from ingress
   node R1 to two egress nodes: L1 and L2.  The primary LSP is
   represented by star(*) lines and backup LSPs by hyphen(-) lines.

   La and Lb are the designated backup egress nodes for egress nodes L1
   and L2 of the P2MP LSP respectively.  To distinguish between an
   egress (e.g., L1 in the figure) and a backup egress (e.g., La in the
   figure), an egress is called a primary egress if necessary.

   The backup LSP for protecting primary egress L1 is from its upstream
   node R3 to backup egress La.  The backup LSP for protecting primary
   egress L2 is from its upstream node R5 to backup egress Lb.

   During normal operations, the traffic carried by the P2MP LSP is sent
   through R3 to L1, which delivers the traffic to its destination CE1.
   When R3 detects the failure of L1, R3 switches the traffic to the
   backup LSP to backup egress La, which delivers the traffic to CE1.
   The time for switching the traffic is within tens of milliseconds.

   The failure of a primary egress (e.g., L1 in the figure) MAY be
   detected by its upstream node (e.g., R3 in the figure) through a BFD
   session between the upstream node and the egress in MPLS networks.
   Exactly how the failure is detected is out of scope for this
   document.

1.2.  Egress Local Protection with FRR

   Using the egress local protection and the FRR, we can locally protect
   the egresses, the links and the intermediate nodes of an LSP.  The
   traffic switchover time is within tens of milliseconds whenever an
   egress, any of the links and the intermediate nodes of the LSP fails.

   The egress nodes of the LSP can be locally protected via the egress
   local protection.  All the links and the intermediate nodes of the
   LSP can be locally protected through using the FRR.


2.  Protocol Extensions

   A new object EGRESS_BACKUP_SUB_LSP is defined for signaling egress
   local protection.  It contains a backup egress for a primary egress.

2.1.  EGRESS_BACKUP_SUB_LSP IPv4/IPv6 Object

   The class of the EGRESS_BACKUP_SUB_LSP IPv4/IPv6 object is 50, which
   is the same as that of the S2L_SUB_LSP IPv4/IPv6 object defined in
   RFC 4875.  The C-Type of the EGRESS_BACKUP_SUB_LSP IPv4 object is a
   new number 3 or another number assigned by IANA.

   upstream node of the primary egress to a backup egress.  Its format
   is identical to an ERO's.

   The class of an EB-SERO is the same as that of a SERO defined in RFC
   4873.  The EB-SERO uses a new C-Type 3, or another number assigned by
   IANA.  The formats of sub-objects in an EB-SERO are identical to
   those of sub-objects in an ERO defined in RFC 3209.

2.3.  Path Message

   A Path message is enhanced to carry the information about a backup
   egress for a primary egress of an LSP through including an egress
   backup sub LSP descriptor list.  The format of the enhanced Path
   message is illustrated below.

    <Path Message> ::=  <Common Header> [ <INTEGRITY> ]
                        [ [<MESSAGE_ID_ACK> | <MESSAGE_ID_NACK>] ...]
                        [ <MESSAGE_ID> ]
                        <SESSION> <RSVP_HOP> <TIME_VALUES>
                        [ <EXPLICIT_ROUTE> ]
                        <LABEL_REQUEST> [ <PROTECTION> ]
                        [ <LABEL_SET> ... ]
                        [ <SESSION_ATTRIBUTE> ] [ <NOTIFY_REQUEST> ]
                        [ <ADMIN_STATUS> ] [ <POLICY_DATA> ... ]
                        <sender descriptor>
                        [<S2L sub-LSP descriptor list>]
                        [<egress backup sub LSP descriptor list>]


   The egress backup sub LSP descriptor list in the message is defined
   below.  It is a sequence of EGRESS_BACKUP_SUB_LSP objects, each of
   which describes a pair of a primary egress and a backup egress.

      <egress backup sub LSP descriptor list> ::=
                        <egress backup sub LSP descriptor>
                        [ <egress backup sub LSP descriptor list> ]

      <egress backup sub LSP descriptor> ::=
                        <EGRESS_BACKUP_SUB_LSP>
                        [ <EGRESS_BACKUP_SECONDARY_EXPLICIT_ROUTE> ]

Internet-Draft         P2MP LSP Egress Protection          November 2013


3.1.  Ingress Behavior

   To protect a primary egress of an LSP, a backup egress must be
   configured on the ingress of the LSP.

   The ingress initiates a Path message for the LSP with an egress
   backup sub LSP descriptor list.  For each primary egress of the LSP
   to be protected, the ingress MUST add an EGRESS_BACKUP_SUB_LSP object
   into the list.  The object contains the primary egress and the backup
   egress for protecting the primary egress.

   To protect a primary egress of an LSP via one-to-one backup or
   facility backup method, the ingress SHOULD include a FAST_REROUTE
   object and set the One-to-One Backup Desired or Facility Backup
   Desired flag.

   To protect a primary egress of a P2MP LSP via S2L Sub LSP backup
   method, the ingress SHOULD add an EB-SERO object following the
   EGRESS_BACKUP_SUB_LSP object into the list.  The EB-SERO object
   contains a path from the upstream node of the primary egress to the
   backup egress.  The ingress computes the path if the P2MP LSP is in
   one area; otherwise, the path may be computed by the Path Computation
   Element (PCE).

3.2.  Intermediate Node and PLR Behavior

   If an intermediate node of an LSP receives the Path message with an
   egress backup sub LSP descriptor list and it is not an upstream node
   of any primary egress of the LSP, it forwards the list in the message
   unchanged.

   If the intermediate node is the upstream node of a primary egress to
   be protected, it gets the backup egress for the primary egress from
   the EGRESS_BACKUP_SUB_LSP object in the list.  It acts as a PLR to
   provide one-to-one or facility backup protection for the primary
   egress.  It provides one-to-one backup protection if the One-to-One
   Backup Desired flag is set in the message; it provides facility
   backup protection if the Facility Backup Desired flag is set.

   The PLR (upstream node of the primary egress) sets the protection
   flags in the RRO Sub-object for the primary egress in the Resv
   message according to the status of the primary egress and the backup
   LSP protecting the primary egress.  For example, it will set the
   "local protection available" and the "node protection" flag to one
   indicating that the primary egress is protected when the backup LSP
   to the backup egress is set up for protecting the primary egress.

Internet-Draft         P2MP LSP Egress Protection          November 2013


3.2.1.  Signaling for One-to-One Protection

   The behavior of the upstream node of a primary egress of an LSP as a
   PLR is the same as that of a PLR for one-to-one backup method
   described in RFC 4090 except for that the upstream node creates a
   backup LSP from itself to a backup egress.

   In the case that the LSP is a P2MP LSP and a primary egress of the
   LSP is a transit node (i.e., bud node), the upstream node of the
   primary egress as a PLR also creates a backup LSP from itself to each
   of the next hops of the primary egress.

   When the PLR detects a failure in the primary egress, it MUST rapidly
   switch the packets from the primary LSP to the backup LSP to the
   backup egress.  For a failure in the bud node of an P2MP LSP, the PLR
   MUST also rapidly switch the packets to the backup LSPs to the bud
   node's next hops, where the packets are merged into the primary LSP.

3.2.2.  Signaling for Facility Protection

   Except for backup LSP and downstream label, the behavior of the
   upstream node of the primary egress as a PLR follows the PLR behavior
   for facility backup method described in RFC 4090.

   For a number of primary P2P LSPs going through the same PLR to the
   same primary egress, the primary egress of these LSPs may be
   protected by one backup LSP from the PLR to the backup egress
   designated for protecting the primary egress.

   The PLR selects or creates a backup LSP from itself to the backup
   egress.  If there exists a backup LSP that satisfies the constraints
   given in the Path message, then this one is selected; otherwise, a
   new backup LSP to the backup egress will be created.

   For a primary LSP carrying IP packets, the PLR does not need any
   downstream label as an inner label for the LSP when binding the
   primary LSP with the backup LSP.  When the PLR detects a failure in
   the primary egress, it redirects the IP packets from the primary LSP
   into the backup LSP to the backup egress, where the IP packets are
   forwarded according to IP destinations in the packets.

   For a primary LSP carrying packets with application or service
   labels, the PLR may not need any downstream label as an inner label
   for the LSP either when binding the primary LSP with the backup LSP.
   When the PLR detects a failure in the primary egress, it redirects
   the packets from the primary LSP into the backup LSP to backup egress
   through switching the top label with the backup LSP label.  The
   backup egress delivers the packets to the same destinations as the

   primary egress (see details in section "Considering Application
   Traffic" below).

3.2.3.  Signaling for S2L Sub LSP Protection

   The S2L Sub LSP Protection is used to protect a primary egress of a
   P2MP LSP.  Its major advantage is that the application traffic
   carried by the P2MP LSP may be easily protected against the egress
   failure.

   The PLR determines to protect a primary egress of a P2MP LSP via S2L
   sub LSP protection when it receives a Path message with an EB-SERO
   object following the EGRESS_BACKUP_SUB_LSP containing the primary
   egress and a backup egress.

   The PLR sets up the backup S2L sub LSP to the backup egress, creates
   and maintains its state in the same way as of setting up a source to
   leaf (S2L) sub LSP defined in RFC 4875 from the signaling's point of
   view.  It constructs and sends a PATH message along the path given in
   the EB-SERO for the backup LSP, receives and processes a RESV message
   that responses to the PATH message.

   After receiving the RESV message for the backup LSP, the PLR creates
   a forwarding entry with an inactive state or flag called inactive
   forwarding entry.  This inactive forwarding entry is not used to
   forward any data traffic during normal operations.

   When the PLR detects a failure in the primary egress failure, it
   changes the forwarding entry for the backup LSP to active.  Thus, the
   PLR forwards the traffic to the backup egress through the backup LSP,
   which sends the traffic to its destination.

3.2.4.  PLR Procedures during Local Repair

   When the upstream node of a primary egress of an LSP as a PLR detects
   a failure in the primary egress, it follows the procedures defined in
   section 6.5 of RFC 4090.

   The PLR (i.e., the upstream node of the primary egress) SHOULD notify
   the ingress about the failure of the primary egress in the same way
   as a PLR notifies the ingress about the failure of an intermediate
   node.

   In the local revertive mode, the PLR re-signals each of the primary
   LSPs that used to be routed over the restored resource once it
   detects that the resource is restored.  Every primary LSP
   successfully re-signaled along the restored resource is switched
   back.

Internet-Draft         P2MP LSP Egress Protection          November 2013


   Moreover, the PLR lets the upstream part of the primary LSP stay
   after the primary egress fails.  The downstream part of the primary
   LSP from the PLR to the primary egress SHOULD be removed.


4.  Considering Application Traffic

   This section focuses on the application traffic carried by P2P LSPs.
   When a primary egress of a P2MP LSP fails, the application traffic
   carried by the P2MP LSP may be delivered to the same destination by
   the backup egress since the inner label if any for the traffic is a
   upstream assigned label for every egress of the P2MP LSP.

4.1.  A Typical Application

   L3VPN is a typical application that an LSP carries.  An existing
   solution (refer to Figure 2) for protecting L3VPN traffic against
   egress failure includes: 1) A multi-hop BFD session between ingress
   R1 and egress L1 of primary LSP; 2) A backup LSP from ingress R1 to
   backup egress La; 3) La sends R1 VPN backup label and related
   information via BGP; 4) R1 has a VRF with two sets of routes: one
   uses primary LSP and L1 as next hop; the other uses backup LSP and La
   as next hop.

     one VPN      *                  :   $            ---- Backup LSP
                 *  .................:    $           .... BFD Session
             [R1] ..:                      [CE2]         $ Link
            $    \                        $             $
           $      \                      $
      [CE1]        [R4]-----[R5]-----[La](BGP sends R1 VPN backup label)


                Figure 2: Protect Egress for L3VPN Traffic

   In normal operations, R1 sends the traffic from CE1 through primary
   LSP with VPN label received from L1 as inner label to L1, which
   delivers the traffic to CE2 using VPN label.

   When R1 detects a failure in L1, R1 sends the traffic from CE1 via
   backup LSP with VPN bakup label received from La as inner label to
   La, which delivers the traffic to CE2 using VPN backup label.

   A new solution (refer to Figure 3) with egress local protection for
   protecting L3VPN traffic includes: 1) A BFD session between R3 and
   egress L1 of primary LSP; 2) A backup LSP from R3 to backup egress
   La; 3) L1 sends La VPN label as UA label and related information via
   BGP or another protocol; 4) L1 and La is virtualized as one from R1's

   point of view.

     one VPN      *          \ :.....:   $            ---- Backup LSP
                 *            \           $           .... BFD Session
             [R1]               \          [CE2]         $ Link
            $                     \       $             $
           $                        \    $
      [CE1]                          [La](VPN label from L1 as UA label)


            Figure 3: Locally Protect Egress for L3VPN Traffic

   When R3 detects a failure in L1, R3 sends the traffic from primary
   LSP via backup LSP to La, which delivers the traffic to CE2 using VPN
   label under the backup LSP label as a context label.

4.2.  PLR Procedure for Applications

   When the PLR creates a backup LSP from itself to a backup egress for
   protecting a primary egress, it includes an EGRESS_BACKUP_SUB_LSP
   object in the Path message for the LSP.  The object contains the
   primary egress and the backup egress and indicates that the backup
   egress SHOULD consider the backup LSP label as a context label and
   the inner label as application traffic label when needed.

4.3.  Egress Procedures for Applications

   When a primary egress of an LSP sends the ingress of the LSP a label
   for an application such as a VPN, it SHOULD sends the backup egress
   for protecting the primary egress the label as a upstream assigned
   label via BGP or another protocol.  Exactly how the label is sent is
   out of scope for this document.

   When the backup egress receives a upstream assigned label from the
   primary egress, it adds a forwarding entry with the label into the
   LFIB for the primary egress.  Using this entry, the backup egress
   delivers the traffic with this label as inner label from the backup
   LSP to the same destination as the primary egress.

   When the backup egress receives a packet from the backup LSP, it uses
   the top label as a context label to find the LFIB for the primary
   egress and the inner label to deliver the packet to the same
   destination as the primary egress according to the LFIB.
