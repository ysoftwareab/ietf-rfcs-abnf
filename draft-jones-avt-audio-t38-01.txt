1. Introduction

   ITU-T Recommendation T.38 [1] defines the Internet Facsimile Protocol
   (IFP) and packetization of that protocol for carriage over IP
   networks.  As one option, IFP packets may be carried within an RTP
   [3] stream, either as the only content within the media stream or
   switched with other audio payload types.

   This memo provides rationale for using RTP for the transport of fax
   signaling via RTP and specifies the MIME type to be used.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [4].

3. Mechanisms for Transporting T.38 over an IP Network

   When T.38 was first approved in 1998, it allowed for the transport of
   T.38 via UDP (using UDPTL, rather than RTP) or TCP.  As of the time
   of this publication, UDPTL is the predominant means for transporting
   T.38 data over an IP network.  In support of that, RFC 3362 was
   published in order to allow devices to signal their desire to use
   UDPTL to transport T.38.

   A number of issues were raised with respect to the usage of UDPTL for
   the long-term, though.  Specifically, there were concerns over the
   fact that UDPTL does not provide the same kind of statistics
   reporting as RTCP.  Further, there are no procedures in place for
   encrypting the UDPTL stream.  While the latter could be addressed in
   UDPTL, doing so would require a lot of effort and would largely be a
   duplication of the security work already on-going within the IETF.

   There are clear advantages in using RTP for T.38 today.  For example,
   using RTP allows one to take advantage of the redundancy [10], header
   compression [11][12], and other RTP-related work within the IETF.
   Using RTP, as opposed to UDPTL, for transport may provide better
   interoperability with a wider range of devices that know and
   understand RTP.  This includes applications such as firewall and NAT
   devices, multipoint control units (MCUs), and media gateways that
   bridge two IP networks.

   Lastly, since most T.38 data today is generated by gateways that
   bridge two PSTN networks, it is quite natural to expect the
   transition from audio to fax should happen within the same media

   stream.  The reason is that the T.38 data is simply an alternative
   representation of information received on the PSTN circuit.  If the
   T.38 data is encapsulated in RTP, the gateways can easily transition
   from audio to fax and back again and can simply use the payload type
   to indicate the type of media that it is currently transmitting.

   With these considerations in mind, the ITU-T amended T.38 [1] to
   allow RTP to be used to transport T.38.  With that, a new MIME
   registration (audio/t38) is needed to allow for T.38 to be switched
   along with audio within the same RTP session.

4. IANA Considerations

   To: ietf-types@iana.org
   Subject: Registration of Standard MIME media type audio/t38

   MIME media type name: audio

   MIME subtype name: t38

   Require parameters:
      rate: The RTP timestamp clock rate, which is equal to the sampling
      rate.  If the T.38 stream is associated with other audio streams
      in an RTP session, the chosen rate SHOULD match that of the other
      streams. Otherwise, a rate of 8000 Hz SHOULD be used.

   Optional parameters: none

   Encoding considerations:
      The encoding of the IFP RTP packets is defined in ITU-T
      Recommendation T.38.  This sub-type is not intended for
      use with e-mail.

   Security considerations:

      See Section 5 of RFC XXXX.

   Interoperability considerations:

      ITU-T Recommendation T.38 defines the procedures, syntax, and
      parameters for the carriage of T.38 over RTP within the context
      of H.323 [6], SIP [7], and H.248 [5] systems.

   Published specification:

      facsimile communication over IP networks", with Amendment TBD,
      January 2004.

5. SDP Mapping of MIME Parameters

   The MIME information is described in section 5 is utilized in SDP in
   order to establish media T.38 streams.  Specifically:

      o  The MIME type ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.

      o  The MIME subtype ("t38") goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as the
         encoding name.

      o  The parameter "rate" also goes in "a=rtpmap" as clock
         rate.

   Consider the following example, which describes a media stream that
   allows the transport of G.711 audio and T.38 fax information:

      m=audio 6808 RTP/AVP 0 98
      a=rtpmap:98 t38/8000

6. Security Considerations

   The IFP packets carried via RTP do not carry any particular security
   risks in and of themselves.  However, as with other audio packets,
   there is the potential for unauthorized eavesdropping or manipulation
   of facsimile transmissions if the media stream is not properly
   secured.

   The security considerations discussed in the RTP specification [3]
   and any applicable RTP profile (for example, [8]) are also
   applicable.
