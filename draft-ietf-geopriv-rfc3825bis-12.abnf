AT = 2  building floors of altitude.

Datum = 1 denotes the vertical datum WGS 84 as defined by the EPSG as
           their CRS Code 4327; CRS Code 4327 also specifies WGS 84 as
           the vertical datum

Datum = 2 denotes the vertical datum NAD83 as defined by the EPSG as
           their CRS Code 4269; North American Vertical Datum of 1988
           (NAVD88) is the associated vertical datum for NAD83

Datum = 3 denotes the vertical datum NAD83 as defined by the EPSG as
           their CRS Code 4269; Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) is the
           associated vertical datum for NAD83
