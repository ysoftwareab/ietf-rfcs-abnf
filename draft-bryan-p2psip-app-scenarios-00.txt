Internet-Draft        P2PSIP Application Scenarios         November 2007


1.  Introduction

   This document attempts to identify and classify application scenarios
   for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) based Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   [RFC3261].  Identifying application scenarios will help to understand
   and clarify requirements of P2PSIP.  In particular, these application
   scenarios will assist the P2PSIP community in identifying
   commonalities and differences between requirements for different
   application scenarios, which in turn will help define the near-term
   scope of specifications and provide a perspective on future
   specifications.

   Only application scenarios related to real-time IP communications,
   such as VoIP, Instant Messaging (IM), and presence are considered in
   this document.  Application scenarios of other kinds, even if
   interesting and possibly useful applications of P2PSIP, are out of
   scope for this document.  Thus, application scenarios described
   herein are application scenarios of P2P IP real-time communications,
   and P2PSIP is a protocol choice rather than a constraining factor for
   most of them.  In describing application scenarios, no deliberation
   on implementation is provided.  Some of the application scenarios
   presented may already be implemented or deployed, possibly using
   proprietary technology.

   The list of application scenarios compiled here is by no means a
   complete list of uses cases of P2PSIP, and further cases would be
   limited only by the imagination.  P2PSIP participants who expect to
   use P2PSIP technology for application scenarios that don't match any
   of the combinations of attributes included in this document are
   invited to contribute descriptions of additional application
   scenarios to the P2PSIP working group mailing list.

   We tried to capture the deployment characteristics of the application
   scenarios such as whether the nodes will span over multiple physical
   network administrative domains or whether the ID must be controlled
   by a central authority.  The characteristics are presented as
   scenario-attribute tables.  The values in the tables are what we
   think are most likely and we understand there may be similar
   scenarios with different choices for some attribute values.

   Some of these application scenarios, while difficult to implement
   using a traditional client server SIP (CS SIP) architecture may not
   require P2P and could be implemented in other ways.  While these have
   often been presented as scenarios calling for P2P communication, the
   authors recognize that other technologies may also be applicable to
   these application scenarios.

   Since the original iteration of this document, the P2PSIP WG has been

Internet-Draft        P2PSIP Application Scenarios         November 2007


   formed and numerous documents have been submitted that include some
   number of application scenarios.  We will not try to enumerate them
   here.  This draft draws from these documents, as well as discussions
   at the P2PSIP ad-hoc and WG meetings and numerous mailing list and
   personal conversations of the authors.


2.  Terminology

   We use terminology defined in RFC 3261 [RFC3261] in this document
   without further definition.

   We use terminology defined in Concepts and Terminology for Peer to
   Peer SIP [I-D.willis-p2psip-concepts] draft in this document without
   further definition.

   We define the attributes used in the discussion of each application
   scenario in Section 3.


3.  Application Scenario Attributes

   The attributes used in the application scenarios matrixes in
   subsequent sections are explained here.

   Application Scenario:  The name of an application scenario
         (previously called a "use case").
   Section in Draft:  A cross-reference to the section number in this
         draft where the application scenario is described.
   Number of Peers:  The number of peers that will be active in an
         overlay at any given point in time.
   Number of Users:  The number of users that will be served by an
         overlay at any given point in time.
         Note that if there are more users than peers, this implies that
         some client protocol is required, whether "client protocol" is
         a P2PSIP client protocol or the SIP protocol (if the P2PSIP
         overlay is also providing RFC 3263 [RFC3263]-style routing for
         unmodified SIP clients).
   Overlay spans administrative domains:  Whether the overlay spans
         across multiple physical network administrative domains.  If
         "yes", this makes IP multicast and centralized operations and
         management unlikely.
   Multicast Available:  Whether "application-level multicast", "IP
         multicast", or "link multicast" may be available for a typical
         overlay.

Internet-Draft        P2PSIP Application Scenarios         November 2007


         Note that these are ordered - link multicast implies IP
         multicast could be available, and IP multicast implies
         application-level multicast could be available.
   P2P Client Support:  Whether the overlay need to support a P2P Client
         protocol, i.e., whether the overlay contains P2P Clients as
         well as Peers.
   Interoperation with CS-SIP:  Whether the overlay must also interact
         with legacy SIP clients and SIP proxies.
         Note that one or more peers in the overlay may also act as PSTN
         gateways.
   Non-stop Operation:  Whether this application scenarios allows the
         overlay to become unavailable for periods of time (for example,
         could an overlay stop operating in order to change DHT
         algorithms, or would the overlay have to support two DHT
         algorithms in "ships in the night" mode?)
   Centralized Operations and Management:  Whether any centralized
         operations/management entity is responsible for successful
         operation of the overlay.
   Centralized ID Control:  Whether ID assignment by central authority
         is required within an overlay (basically, whether the overlay
         can be Sybil-attacked - the theory is that if IDs are
         controlled by a centralized entity, overlay operators simply
         remove misbehaving users from the authorization registry).
   Supports Anonymous Users:  Whether this application scenario allows
         users to connect to an overlay without providing any identity.
   Carrier-Class Robustness:  Whether the overlay must provide reliable
         storage and retrieval in the face of node failure.
   NATs within a single overlay  Whether the peer protocol must expect
         to perform NAT traversal as part of normal operation.
   DNS available:  Whether DNS is available so that peers may perform
         DNS lookups as part of the overlay JOIN operation.
   End-to-end SIP Encryption:  Whether this application scenario
         requires SIP traffic between two peers to be encrypted, so SIP
         requests and responses are not visible to intermediate peers
         (peers that forward traffic between two peers that aren't
         directly connected).  In these cases, hop-by-hop TLS
         encryption, although appropriate when traversing trusted SIP
         Proxies, is not appropriate when traversing untrusted P2PSIP
         Peers.


4.  Application Scenarios

   Application scenarios are grouped according to the characteristics of
   the network environment in which the end users or devices
   participating in the P2P overlay are communicating with each other.

Internet-Draft        P2PSIP Application Scenarios         November 2007


4.1.  Global Internet Environment

   The global Internet environment consists of a large number of
   autonomous networks with diverse characteristics.  Thus, there is no
   central administration or network control of the physical network on
   a global scale.  Communication paths between two remote devices may
   span multiple administrative domains and should be assumed to be
   insecure.  Note that most well-known P2P file sharing overlay
   networks have operated in this environment.

4.1.1.  Public P2P VoIP Service Providers

   Skype is an outstanding example of a public VoIP service provider
   using P2P technology among end user devices, although Skype uses a
   proprietary protocol.  Recent research has shown [skypestudy] that
   Skype uses a central login server, responsible for management of
   registered user names.  End users are authenticated via a certificate
   signed by a central server.  End user devices are distributed across
   the global Internet.  The number of participating end user devices is
   very large.  A major motivation of using P2P between end user devices
   for a commercial VoIP service is a reduction in infrastructure and
   operational costs.

                                  Table 1

4.1.2.  Open Global P2P VoIP Network

   This is a global P2P VoIP network in which there is no central
   authority such as a single service provider.  Anyone can join and
   leave the network freely and anyone can implement the software to
   participate in the overlay network.  In such a system, the protocols
   used must be based on open standards.  This P2P VoIP network
   resembles the global Internet itself in that it has distributed
   management and growth, enables anyone to reach anyone else in the
   overlay network, and any device supporting the standard protocols can
   be used.

   Table 1 provides a high-level overview of this category.

4.1.3.  Wide Area Networks of Consumer Electronics Devices

   Instant messaging application software provides presence, text and
   media messaging, and file transfer capabilities between online users.
   As more and more multimedia consumer electronics devices such as
   cameras, camcorders and televisions become network aware, instant
   sharing of multimedia content such as photos and video clips between
   family members and friends will be desirable.  VoIP may not be needed
   on some of these consumer electronics devices, however in other cases
   such as gaming, voice communication between users may be highly
   desirable.  As consumer electronics providers may desire to provide
   these capabilities without investing in extensive server
   capabilities, a global P2P network supporting presence is an
   important infrastructure component for this application scenario.

4.1.4.  Multimedia content sharing via Application Layer Multicasting
        (Content Providers or Ad Hoc)

   IP-layer multicasting is not generally available beyond the boundary
   of single IP subnet.  Application layer multicasting has become a
   plausible alternative to IP-layer multicasting.  In application layer
   multicasting, the nodes that need to receive the content from the
   same source form a distribution network, typically of a tree-like
   topology, and relay the received content to other nodes in the
   distribution network.  This technique can be used to multicasting
   video or audio stream to a number of nodes distributed over the
   Internet (or across multiple IP subnets).

   Note that this application scenario covers two types of deployments -
   large-scale commercial audio or video distribution/broadcasting
   services such as Internet radio or TV services ("Content Provider")
   or to ad-hoc video sharing among a group of friends ("Ad Hoc").

   Table 3 provides a high-level overview of this category.

4.2.  Environments with Limited Connectivity to the Internet or
      Infrastructure

   When there is no physical network available for stable deployment of
   client server SIP or an instant deployment of real-time communication
   systems is required, the P2P approach may be the only feasible
   solution.  Examples of such environment are isolated wireless ad-hoc
   networks with no connection to the Internet or ad-hoc networks with
   limited connectivity to the Internet in situations like outdoor
   public events, emergencies, and battlefields.  Any type of manual
   configuration is difficult to achieve because technical support is
   not readily available in such environment.  In some cases,
   connectivity to the global Internet may be available, but be very
   expensive, of limited capacity, or unstable, such as satellite
   connections.  In such cases, it is preferable to localize
   communications as much as possible, reducing dependency on any
   infrastructure in the global Internet.

   Table 4 provides a high-level overview of this category.

         Environments with Limited Connectivity to the Internet or

                                  Table 4

4.2.1.  Ad-Hoc and Ephemeral Groups

   Groups of individuals meeting together have need for collaborative
   communications systems that are ephemeral in nature, have minimum
   (ideally zero) configuration, and do not depend on connectivity to
   the Internet.  These scenarios require an arbitrary number of users
   to connect communications devices.  These can include cases where
   Internet connectivity due to remote location, inability to pay for
   connectivity, or following a natural disaster where service is
   interrupted.

   Example: A group gets together for a meeting, but there is no
   Internet connectivity.  If the users establish a wireless ad hoc
   network or have a base station, all users may connect and establish
   chat sessions using an IM protocol with no need for server
   configuration.

   Example: Following a disaster, the local fire department arrives.
   Each fire fighter has a wireless handset, and one or more trucks have
   wireless base stations.  When a nearby locality sends additional
   rescuers, their wireless handsets should be able to instantly join
   the communications network and communicate, without the need for
   central configuration.

4.2.2.  Extending the Reach of Mobile Devices

   [anchor9]

   A network of mobile devices can relay traffic between themselves to

Internet-Draft        P2PSIP Application Scenarios         November 2007


   reach a base station, even if the base station is out of reach of
   that device.

   Example: A user has a handset for communication that cannot reach a
   base station.  Some other user is within range of both that user and
   a base station.  This intermediate user can serve as a relay for the
   caller who is out of range.  A system might make this feature
   optional for standard communication and mandatory for E911.

4.2.3.  Impeded Access

   Certain groups may have their ability to communicate impeded.  These
   users should be able to communicate without the need to connect to
   any centralized servers, which may be blocked by providers upstream
   of the user.  A fully decentralized system cannot be completely
   disconnected without removing connectivity at the basic Internet
   level.

   Example: A user wishes to use an IP telephony service to communicate
   PC to PC with a friend, but the ports commonly used by these
   services, or the servers used for authentication, are blocked by the
   ISP because the ISP also offers communications systems and have a
   vested interest in denying access to external communications systems.

   Example: A user with an Internet enabled PDA devices wishes to
   connect with colleagues, but traditional services are blocked to
   ensure that SMS or voice minutes are used (at additional cost)
   instead.

4.2.4.  Local Area Networks of Consumer Electronics Devices

   In addition to consumer devices sharing information with other users
   across the Internet, having devices that can locate each other and
   exchange information within the local LAN of a particular user may
   also be an attractive application.  In this case, devices could use
   P2PSIP to locate multimedia resources available on other devices and
   stream the information between the devices.

   Example: A user wishes to share content among consumer electronics
   devices within a home network.

4.3.  Managed, Private Network Environments

   A corporate network or a school campus network is an example of the
   managed, private network environment.  Most likely client server SIP
   can be used and managed for real-time communication applications in
   these environments.  However, in certain scenarios, P2PSIP may be
   used instead or as a complementary means, to achieve various goals

   such as cost and management overhead reduction, scalability, and
   system robustness.

4.3.1.  Serverless or Small Scale IP-PBX

   Many small enterprises have a need for integrated communications
   systems.  These systems have slightly different requirements than
   more traditional IP PBXs.  For small enterprises, there may be no
   administrator for these systems, requiring the systems to be
   essentially self-configuring and/or self-organizing.  Additional
   endpoints should be able to be added with no requirements for
   configuration on central devices.

   These systems should offer the feature sets similar to those of
   client server type PBX systems.  Connectivity to the PSTN is an
   important feature for these systems.  In addition, they may support
   features such as call transfer, voice mail, and possibly even other
   communications modes such as instant messaging or media features such
   as video or conference services.  There are already commercial
   products of this type.

   Example: Small organizations without centralized IT

4.3.2.  P2P for Redundant SIP Proxies

   Service providers may wish to connect a farm of proxies together in a
   transparent way, passing resources (user registrations or other call
   information) between themselves with as little configuration or
   traffic as possible.  Ideally, the redundancy and exchange of
   information should require a minimum of configuration between the
   devices.  P2P architecture between the proxies allows proxy farms to
   be organized and operated in this way.  With this approach, it is
   easy to add more proxies with minimal service disruptions and
   increases the robustness of the system.

   Example: a SIP service provider may wish to scale SIP proxies by
   using a P2PSIP overlay that provides RFC 3263 [RFC3263] request
   routing services, instead of using either front-end load balancing
   devices or making the structure of the proxy farm visible outside the
   proxy farm itself.

4.3.3.  Failover for Centralized Systems

   A traditional centralized SIP server, such as used in an IP-PBX,
   forms a single point of failure of an otherwise fault-independent
   network.  Relying on P2PSIP as a backup to the centralized server
   allows the communications system to continue functioning normally in
   the event of planned or unplanned service interruptions of the
   central IP-PBX.  When combined with a low-configuration P2PSIP PBX,

   connectivity is severed.

   Example: A small company has a central IP-PBX.  When that device
   experiences a failure, the handsets are able to transparently
   continue operation for the 24 hours it takes to obtain a replacement
   switch.

   Example: A village in the developing world has connectivity that is
   limited by weather (microwave connection) or is solar powered.  It
   would be desirable for intra-village communication to continue to
   function in the absence of Internet connectivity.

Editorial Comments

   [anchor9]  Spencer has misgivings about "Extending the Reach of
              Mobile Devices", based on  (1) relaying at the link layer
              or at the  network layer would make more sense, and would
              work for devices that do not support P2PSIP, and (2)
              although small networks might work well enough when peers
              simply forward a request "around the overlay",  in larger
              networks  the problem space morphs from forwarding traffic
              in *the* direction of  a destination to routing traffic in
              the *best* direction to the destination - a much harder
              problem.
