 Deployment of the Low Weight IETF protocols In Internet of Things(IOT)
                      draft-fu-lwig-iot-usecase-00

Abstract

   This draft analyze the development and deployment of the existing
   IETF Low weight IPv6 protocols in the IOT (Internet Of Things)
   industry.  Taking consideration on the constrained resource nature of
   devices, the IETF low weight IPv6 protocols, including 6LowPan, RPC
   and COAP, fit perfectly in the IOT scenarios.  Recent development and
   promotion of Zigbee IP and IPSO also extend the use of these low
   weight IPv6 protocols.

1.  Introduction

   With the fast development of wireless sensor technology and IC
   technology, the concept of IOT (Internet Of Things) has been realized
   and promoted in the Information Industry.  IOT intends to build a
   network to connect all devices, systems and services, which claims a
   vast need of IP addresses.Due to its inherent advantage of huge
   address pool, IPv6 has been chosen as the fundamental Internet
   protocol by IETF ever since the research of IOT.

   Due to the constrained resource nature of devices in IOT, working
   groups in IETF mainly focus on low weight IPv6 protocols, which
   include 6LowPan working group, RoLL working group, and CoRE working
   group.  Other standardization organizations, such as IPSO, Zigbee,
   ISA and etc., are dedicated in promoting the deployment of these
   protocols.  With years of research and development, a number of
   application cases and solutions for IOT based on IPv6 have been
   proposed and deployed.  In this draft, we will summarize the latest
   deployments and usecases of protocols about IPv6 in IETF.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  ZigBee IP

   ZigBee is the industry alliance based on IEEE 802.15.4.  It mainly
   focuses on standarization of network laryer and application layer in
   short range wireless communication.The PHY and MAC layer of ZigBee is
   IEEE 802.15.4.

   ZigBee IP is the first open standard for an IPv6-based full wireless
   mesh networking solution and provides seamless Internet connections
   to control low-power, low-cost devices.  It connects dozens of the
   different devices into a single control network.

   ZigBee IP was designed to support the ZigBee Smart Energy version 2
   standard, published in 2013, which offers a global standard for IP-
   based control,both wired and wireless, for energy management in Home
   Area Networks(HANs).Such standard is expected to be used in Smart
   Grid applications.

   Zigbee IP has been recently updated to include 920IP, published in
   July, 2014,which provides specific support for ECHONET Lite and the
   requirements of Japanese Home Energy Management systems. 920IP was
   developed in response to Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and
   Communications (MIC) designation of 920 MHz for use in HEMS and
   Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry(METI) endorsement of ECHONET
   Lite as a smart home standard.  920IP is the only standard referenced
   by the Telecommunications Technology Committee (TTC) which supports
   multi-hop mesh networking.

   The ZigBee IP specification enriches the IEEE 802.15.4 standard by
   adding network and security layers and an application framework.
   ZigBee IP offers a scalable architecture with end-to-end IPv6
   networking, laying the foundation for an Internet of Things without
   the need for intermediate gateways.  It offers cost-effective and
   energy-efficient wireless mesh network based on standard Internet
   protocols, such as 6LoWPAN, IPv6, PANA, RPL, TCP, TLS and UDP.  It
   also features proven, end-to-end security using TLS1.2 protocol, link
   layer frame security based on AES-128-CCM algorithm and support for
   public key infrastructure using standard X.509 v3 certificates and
   ECC-256 cipher suite.  ZigBee IP enables low-power devices to
   participate natively with other IPv6-enabled Ethernet, Wi-Fi and,
   HomePlug devices.

   ZigBee IP has been paid great attention once it was published in
   2013.  Several chip companies, including Exegin, Silicon Labs, TI and
   etc., have developed chips that support ZigBee IP.

4.  IPSO

   The IPSO Alliance performs interoperability tests, documents the use
   of new IP-based technologies, conducts marketing activities and
   serves as an information repository for users seeking to understand
   the role of IP in networks of physical objects.  Its role complements
   the work of entities such as the Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) or

   the ISA which develop and ratify technical standards in the Internet
   community.

   The ultimate goal of IPSO is to promote the use of IP in the IOT.
   Considering the constraint nature of the IOT devices, several
   technologies, including Lightweight OS, 6LowPan, COAP, and RPL, are
   promoted in IPSO.  Members of IPSO have developed large number of
   commercial devices that support IP-communication.  For example,
   Toshiba has developed a IPv6-capable TV.  Axis provides IPv6-capable
   camera for surveillance use.

5.  Usecases for Operators

   The broad IOT market brings opportunities for operators world wide.
   Interesting deployments of IOT or M2M (Machine to Machine) cases
   based on IPv6 have emerged over the years.For example, the French
   Telecom deploys IPv6 based M2M network in Smart Metering, Intelegent
   Health Monitering, and Smart City.  Considering the constraint nature
   of the devices, low weight IPv6 protocols, including 6LowPan, RPL,
   and COAP are utilized.

6.  Conclusion

   This draft introduces the recent development and deployments of low
   weight IPv6 protocols studied in IETF.  Taking careful consideration
   on the constrained resource nature of the devices in IOT, these low
   weight IPv6 protocols,including 6LowPan, RPL, and COAP, are proved to
   be quite a success in the IOT scenarios.  Generation and improvements
   of industrial standards, such as Zigbee IP, also accelerate the
   deployment of the low weight IPv6 protocols.  We can predice that IOT
   might be a "killer scenario" of the extensive deployment of IPv6
   world wide in the near future.
