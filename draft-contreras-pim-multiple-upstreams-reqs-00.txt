1.  Introduction

   The aim of this document is to define the functionality that an MLD
   proxy with multiple upstream interfaces should have in order to
   support different scenarios of applicability in both fixed and mobile
   networks.  This compatibility is needed in order to simplify node
   functionality and to ensure an easier deployment of multicast
   capabilities in all the use cases described in this document.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

   This document uses the terminology defined in RFC4605 [RFC4605].
   Specifically, the definition of Upstream and Downstream interfaces,
   which are reproduced here for completeness.

   Upstream interface:  A proxy device's interface in the direction of
      the root of the tree.  Also called the "Host interface".

   Downstream interface:  Each of a proxy device's interfaces that is
      not in the direction of the root of the tree.  Also called the
      "Router interfaces".

Internet-Draft  Reqs for MLD proxy with multiple upstream     March 2015


3.  Problem statement

   The concept of MLD proxy with several upstream interfaces has emerged
   as a way of optimizing (and in some cases enabling) service delivery
   scenarios where separate multicast service providers are reachable
   through the same access network infrastructure.  Figure 1 presents
   the conceptual model under consideration.

     Figure 1: Concept of MLD proxy with multiple upstream interfaces

   The current version of the document is focused on fixed network
   scenarios.  Mobile network scenarios will be covered in future
   versions.

   In the case of fixed networks, multicast wholesale services in a
   competitive residential market require an efficient distribution of
   multicast traffic from different operators or content providers, i.e.
   the incumbent operator and a number of alternative providers, on the
   network infrastructure of the former.  Existing proposals are based
   on the use of PIM routing from the metro/core network, and multicast
   traffic aggregation on the same tree.  A different approach could be
   achieved with the use of an MLD proxy with multiple upstream
   interfaces, each of them pointing to a distinct multicast router in
   the metro/core border which is part of separated multicast trees deep
   in the network.  Figure 2 graphically describes this scenario.

     Figure 2: Example of usage of an MLD proxy with multiple upstream
                  interfaces in a fixed network scenario

   Since those scenarios can motivate distinct needs in terms of MLD
   proxy functionality, it is necessary to consider a comprehensive
   approach, looking at the possible scenarios, and establishing a
   minimum set of requirements which can allow the operation of a
   versatile MLD proxy with multiple upstream interfaces as a common
   entity to all of them (i.e., no different kinds of proxies depending
   on the scenario, but a common proxy applicable to all the potential
   scenarios).

4.  Scenarios of applicability

   Having multiple upstream interfaces creates a new decision space for
   delivering the proper multicast content to the subscriber.  Basically
   it is now possible to implement channel-based or subscriber-based
   upstream selection, according to mechanisms or policies that could be
   defined for the multicast service provision.

   This section describes in detail a number of scenarios of
   applicability of an MLD proxy with multiple upstream interfaces in
   place.  A number of requirements for the MLD proxy functionality are
   identified from those scenarios.

Internet-Draft  Reqs for MLD proxy with multiple upstream     March 2015


4.1.  Fixed network scenarios

   Residential broadband users get access to multiple IP services
   through fixed network infrastructures.  End user's equipment is
   connected to an access node, and the traffic of a number of access
   nodes is collected in aggregation switches.

   For the multicast service, the use of an MLD proxy with multiple
   upstream interfaces in those switches can provide service flexibility
   in a lightweight and simpler manner if compared with PIM-routing
   based alternatives.

4.1.1.  Multicast wholesale offer for residential services

   This scenario has been already introduced in the previous section,
   and can be seen in Figure 2.  There are two different operators, the
   one operating the fixed network where the end user is connected
   (e.g., typically an incumbent operator), and the one providing the
   Internet service to the end user (e.g., an alternative Internet
   service provider).  Both can offer multicast streams that can be
   subscribed by the end user, independently of which provider
   contributes with the content.

   Note that it is assumed that both providers offer distinct multicast
   groups.  However, more than one subscription to multicast channels of
   different providers could take place simultaneously.

4.1.1.1.  Requirements

   o  The MLD proxy should be able to deliver multicast control messages
      sent by the end user to the corresponding provider's multicast
      router.

   o  The MLD proxy should be able to deliver multicast control messages
      sent by each of the providers to the corresponding end user.

4.1.2.  Multicast resiliency

   In current PIM-based solutions, the resiliency of the multicast
   distribution relays on the routing capabilities provided by protocols
   like PIM and VRRP.  A simpler scheme could be achieved by
   implementing different upstream interfaces on MLD proxies, providing
   path diversity through the connection to distinct leaves of a given
   multicast tree.

   It is assumed that only one of the upstream interfaces is active in
   receiving the multicast content, while the other is up and in standby
   mode for fast switching.

4.1.2.1.  Requirements

   o  The MLD proxy should be able to deliver multicast control messages
      sent by the end user to the corresponding active upstream
      interface.

   o  The MLD proxy should be able to deliver multicast control messages
      received in the active upstream to the end users, while ignoring
      the control messages of the standby upstream interface.

   o  The MLD proxy should be able of rapidly switching from the active
      to the standby upstream interface in case of network failure,
      transparently to the end user.

4.1.3.  Load balancing for multicast traffic in the metro segment

   A single upstream interface in existing MLD proxy functionality
   typically forces the distribution of all the channels on the same
   path in the last segment of the network.  Multiple upstream
   interfaces could naturally split the demand, alleviating the
   bandwidth requirements in the metro segment.

4.1.3.1.  Requirements

   o  The MLD proxy should be able to deliver multicast control messages
      sent by the end user to the corresponding multicast router which
      provides the channel of interest.

   o  The MLD proxy should be able to deliver multicast control messages
      sent by each of the multicast routers to the corresponding end
      user.

   o  The MLD proxy should be able to decide which upstream interface is
      selected for any new channel request according to defined criteria
      (e.g., load balancing).

4.1.4.  Summary of the requirements needed for fixed network scenarios

   Following the analysis above, a number of different requirements can
   be identified by the MLD proxy to support multiple upstream
   interfaces in fixed network scenarios.  The following table
   summarizes these requirements.
