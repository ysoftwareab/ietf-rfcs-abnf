                    Extended Message support for BGP
                draft-ietf-idr-bgp-extended-messages-28

Abstract

   The BGP specification mandates a maximum BGP message size of 4096
   octets.  As BGP is extended to support newer AFI/SAFIs and other
   features, there is a need to extend the maximum message size beyond
   4096 octets.  This document updates the BGP specification RFC4271 by
   providing an extension to BGP to extend its current maximum message
   size from 4096 octets to 65535 octets for all except the OPEN
   message.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to
   be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] only when they appear in all
   upper case.  They may also appear in lower or mixed case as English
   words, without normative meaning.

1.  Introduction

   The BGP specification [RFC4271] mandates a maximum BGP message size
   of 4096 octets.  As BGP is extended to support newer AFI/SAFIs and
   newer capabilities (e.g., BGPsec, [RFC8205], BGP-LS, [RFC7752]),
   there is a need to extend the maximum message size beyond 4096
   octets.  This draft provides an extension to BGP to extend its
   current message size limit from 4096 octets to 65535 octets for all
   except the OPEN message.

2.  BGP Extended Message

   A BGP message over 4096 octets in length is a BGP Extended Message.

   BGP Extended Messages have maximum message size of 65535 octets.  The
   smallest message that may be sent consists of a BGP header without a
   data portion (19 octets).

3.  Extended Message Capability for BGP

   To advertise the BGP Extended Message Capability to a peer, a BGP
   speaker uses BGP Capabilities Advertisement [RFC5492].  By
   advertising the BGP Extended Message Capability to a peer, a BGP
   speaker conveys that it is able to send, receive, and properly handle
   BGP Extended Messages.

   A peer which does not advertise this capability MUST NOT send BGP
   Extended Messages, and BGP Extended Messages MUST NOT be sent to it.

   The BGP Extended Message Capability is a new BGP Capability [RFC5492]
   defined with Capability code 6 and Capability length 0.

4.  Operation

   A BGP speaker that is capable of sending and receiving BGP Extended
   Messages SHOULD advertise the BGP Extended Message Capability to the
   peer using BGP Capabilities Advertisement [RFC5492].  A BGP speaker
   MAY send Extended Messages to its peer only if it has sent and
   received the Extended Message Capability from that peer.

   The Extended Message Capability applies to all messages except for
   the OPEN message.  This exception is made to reduce complexity of
   providing backward compatibility

   An implementation that advertises support for BGP Extended Messages
   MUST be capable of receiving a message with a length up to and
   including 65535 octets.

   Applications generating information which might be encapsulated
   within BGP messages MUST limit the size of their payload to take the
   maximum message size into account.

   If a BGP update with a payload longer than 4096 octets is received by
   a BGP listener who has neither advertised nor agreed to accept BGP
   Extended Messages, the listener MUST treat this as a malformed update
   message, and MUST raise an UPDATE Message Error (see [RFC4271] Sec
   6.3).

   A BGP announcement will, in the normal case, propagate throughout the
   BGP speaking Internet; and there will undoubtedly be BGP speakers
   which do not have the Extended Message capability.  Therefore,
   putting an attribute which can not be decomposed to 4096 octets or
   less in an Extended Message is a likely path to routing failure.

   It is RECOMMENDED that BGP protocol developers and implementers are
   conservative in their application and use of Extended Messages.

   Future protocol specifications will need to describe how to handle
   peers which can only accommodate 4096 octet messages.

5.  Error Handling

   A BGP speaker that has the ability to use Extended Messages but has
   not advertised the BGP Extended Messages capability, presumably due
   to configuration, SHOULD NOT accept an Extended Message.  A speaker
   MAY implement a more liberal policy and accept Extended Messages,
   even from a peer to which it has not advertised the capability, in
   the interest of preserving the BGP session if at all possible.

   A BGP speaker that does not advertise the BGP Extended Messages
   capability might also genuinely not support Extended Messages.  Such
   a speaker MUST follow the error handling procedures of [RFC4271] if
   it receives an Extended Message.  Similarly, any speaker that treats
   an improper Extended Message as a fatal error, MUST treat it
   similarly.

   The inconsistency between the local and remote BGP speakers MUST be
   flagged to the network operator through standard operational
   interfaces.  The information should include the NLRI and as much
   relevant information as reasonably possible.

6.  Changes to RFC4271

   [RFC4271] states "The value of the Length field MUST always be at
   least 19 and no greater than 4096."  This document changes the latter
   number to 65535 for all except the OPEN message.

   [RFC4271] Sec 6.1, specifies raising an error if the length of a
   message is over 4096 octets.  For all messages except the OPEN
   message, if the receiver has advertised the capability to receive
   Extended Messages, this document raises that limit to 65535.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA has made an early allocation for this new BGP Extended
   Message Capability referring to this document.

8.  Security Considerations

   This extension to BGP does not change BGP's underlying security
   issues; see [RFC4272].

   Section 5 allowed a receiver to accept an Extended Message even
   though it had not advertised the capability.  This slippery slope
   could lead to sloppy implementations sending Extended Messages when
   the receiver is not prepared to deal with them, e.g. to peer groups.
   At best, this will result in errors; at worst, buffer overflows.

   Due to increased memory requirements for buffering, there may be
   increased exposure to resource exhaustion, intentional or
   unintentional.
