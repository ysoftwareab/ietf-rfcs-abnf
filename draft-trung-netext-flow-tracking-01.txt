Abstract

   A mobile node (MN) can connect to the network by using multiple
   interfaces simultaneously or sequentially.  The quality of each
   connection can be changed due to many reasons such as the movement of
   the MN and the interference from the network.  To guarantee the
   quality of service, some flows can be moved from a bad connection to
   another better one.  In this draft we discuss about how to extend the
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) to support such kind of flow mobility.

Internet-Draft     Flow tracking procedure for PMIPv6          July 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [1] can support multihoming.  The
   mobile node can send simultaneously packets to the PMIPv6 domain over
   multiple interfaces.  However it cannot support flow mobility due to
   the following limitations:

   o  When a flow moves from an interface to a new interface, the HNP
      used by that flow will be assigned to the new interface.  This
      action can discontinue the ongoing sessions on both interfaces.[3]

   o  Since a home network prefix (HNP) can be shared by multiple flows,
      when only some of these flows is moved to a new interface, the old
      interface and the new interface should be able to share the same
      HNP.  That is not supported by the current PMIPv6 standard since
      it supports only Per-MN-Prefix model.

   o  After moving flows to a new interface, if these flows share the
      same HNP then the MAG and LMA should be able to forward flows
      basing not only on HNP but also flow identification.  That routing
      capability is not supported by the current PMIPv6 standard.

   To enable PMIPv6 to support flow mobility, we first utilize the
   advantage of the logical interface at MN to hide the changing at
   physical interfaces from the IP layer and then extend the operations
   of PMIPv6 to perform flow-based routing functions.

   Several documents also introduce solutions for flow mobility.  The
   authors in [4] specify a network-controlled protocol to handover
   application flows from one interface to another.  The I-D [5]
   introduces extensions to Proxy Mobile IPv6 that allows networks
   dynamically binding IP flows to different interfaces of a mobile
   node.  The author in [6] describe a mechanism to support flow
   mobility on a logical interface over multiple physical interfaces.

   Our document is different from all of others in the way that we first
   discuss about the flow mobility triggers and then according to each
   kind of trigger we discuss about the necessary extensions of PMIPv6
   to support flow mobility.  We introduce two flow mobility scenarios.
   The first scenario discuss about flow mobility between an existing
   attachment and a new attachment.  The second scenario discuss about
   flow mobility between existing attachments.  Our solutions do not
   require much changes of the PMIPv6.  All necessary changes are
   slightly extending the original operation and data structure of the
   PMIPv6.  It is very easy to implement from the original standard of
   PMIPv6

2.  Design assumptions for supporting flow mobility

2.1.  Logical Interface at the mobile node

   To support flow mobility, we assume that the MN use link layer
   implementation to hide the actually used physical interfaces from the
   IP stack [7].  It provides a logical interface at the IP layer and
   enables packet transmission and reception over different physical
   interface.  The following are necessary requirements of the virtual
   interface to support flow mobility:

   o  The logical interface can simultaneously and/or sequentially
      attach to multiple MAGs

   o  The logical interface can be configured with a single or multiple
      HNP

   o  The logical interface can accept all the packets that have valid
      HNP and received from any physical interface that is abstracted by
      the logical interface

   o  The logical interface should send and receive a flow via the same
      interface

   o  The logical interface can map a flow to a physical interface
      dynamically basing on the network condition.  This operation can
      be performed by the connection manager.  The detail discussion
      about this operation is out of scope of this draft [8]


3.  Flow mobility triggers

   There are three triggers that can activate the flow mobility
   procedures as listed as follows:

   o  Trigger 1: The MN performs an attachment over a new interface.
      The MAG is aware of that event and sends PBU message with the
      handoff indicator of 1 (HI=1) to update the LMA about the current
      position of the MN.

   o  Trigger 2: MN recognizes the change of network condition and
      decides to move a flow from a physical interface to another.
      Since the MN uses logical interface, the movement of a flow
      between physical interfaces is transparent to the IP layer.  The
      MAG can be aware of this event by analyzing the packets received
      from the MN, this procedure will be discussed in the next section.
      After figuring out that it is a new flow sending from the MN, the
      MAG sends PBU message with an indicator to inform that the MAG

      receives a new flow from the MN.  To do that we need to extend the
      PBU message formats, which will be discussed more detail in the
      next section.

   o  Trigger 3: The LMA determines the flow mobility due to some
      reasons.  For example, the LMA can recognize the change of policy
      profile which contains the mapping of a flow to an access network
      technology.  Or, the LMA can recognize the change of network
      condition for wired links as well as wireless links.

   According to each kind of the trigger, the MAG and LMA perform a
   specific flow mobility procedure.  These procedures can be added as
   extensions of the MAG and LMA signaling considerations, which will be
   discussed more detail in the next section.


4.  Flow mobility scenarios

   We consider two flow mobility scenarios.  Each of them has different
   flow mobility triggers and signaling call flow between LMA and MAG.

4.1.  Scenario 1: Flow mobility between an existing attachment to a new
      attachment

   This scenario occurs when the trigger 1 is activated.  The LMA is
   informed about the new attachment of the MN and it realizes that some
   existing flow are should better moved to the new attachment.

      Figure 1: Flow mobility between an existing attachment to a new
                                attachment

   The Figure 1 shows the signaling call flow of the scenario 1.  In
   this figure, the MN is equipped with 2 physical interfaces, PI1 and
   PI2.  First, the flow 1 is served by the PI1, which is the only PI
   attaching to the p-MAG.  Next, the MN attaches to the n-MAG over the
   PI2.  On recognizing the new attachment from the MN, the n-MAG
   informs the LMA by sending a PBU message with the HI=1.  The LMA, on
   receiving the PBU message, setups a new tunnel and lookups for all of
   the flows that is serving for the MN.  For each of flow, the LMA will
   check the MN profile and the operator policy to figure out the flows
   that need to be moved to the new attachment.  In this figure the LMA
   decides to move flow 1 from the attachment of PI1 to that of PI2.  It

   updates the extended BCE to bind the flow 1 to the Proxy-CoA of the
   n-MAG and then sends an extended Reg-PBA message, which has the
   indicator 'S'=1 and 'F'=1, to inform the n-MAG to update BULE and
   setup routing for the flow 1.  The LMA also send an extended De-Reg-
   PBA message, which has the indicator 'S'=1 and 'F'=0, to inform the
   p-MAG to remove the flow 1 from BULE and routing table.  After
   completing these processes, the flow 1 will be exchange via the
   attachment of the PI2 to n-MAG.

4.2.  Scenario 2: Flow mobility among existing attachments

   This scenario occurs when the trigger 2 or 3 is activated

4.2.1.  The MN moves flows

   The Figure 2 shows the signaling call flow of the scenario 2 with the
   trigger 2.  In this example, the MN is equipped with 2 physical
   interfaces PI1 and PI2.  Both PI1 and PI2 attach to the network via
   p-MAG and n-MAG.  At the first time, the flow 1 is served by the PI1.
   As time goes by, the MN detects that the condition of the attachment
   via PI2 is better for serving the flow 1 and it decides to switch the
   flow 1 from PI1 to PI2.  Since we assume that the MN uses logical
   interface, the switching process is performed at link-layer and
   transparent to the IP layer.  When the n-MAG receives the first
   packet of the flow 1, it analyzes the flow information from the
   packet header and lookups for the same flow in the extended BULE.  If
   it cannot find any the same flow, an extended PBU message will be
   sent to the LMA.  The LMA then lookups for the similar flow in the
   extended BCE to check if it is a flow moved from an existing
   attachment.  If it is yes, then the LMA update BCE to bind the flow 1
   to the Proxy-CoA of the n-MAG and then sends an extended Reg-PBA
   message, which has the indicator 'S'=1 and 'F'=1, to inform the n-MAG
   to update BULE and setup routing for the flow 1.  The LMA also send
   an extended De-Reg-PBA message, which has the indicator 'S'=1 and
   'F'=0, to inform the p-MAG to remove the flow 1 from BULE and routing
   table.  After completing these processes, the flow 1 will be exchange
   via the attachment of the PI2 to n-MAG.

4.2.2.  The LMA moves flows

   The Figure 3 shows the signaling call flow of the scenario 2 with the
   trigger 3.  First, the LMA realize that the operator policy changes
   or the service profile of the MN changes and decide to move some
   flows from an existing attachment to another.  The other steps 2-6
   are the same as the steps 4-8 in the Figure 2

5.  LMA extensions

5.1.  Flow identifier management

   The LMA should be extended to manage the flow information.  The
   description of a flow is the n-tuple information including [Source
   Address, Destination Address, Source Port, Destination Port, and
   Protocol] and the other information such as flow-label, traffic-
   class, etc..  The LMA generates a unique ID for each flow.  This ID
   will be used as an extension filed of the BCE to identify the flow.
   The LMA maintains a table mapping between Flow-ID and Flow
   description.  After a specific time, if the LMA do not receive any
   packet that has the same header information as any of the flow
   description in this table, the corresponding record in the table will

   be removed.

5.2.  Binding Cache Entry extension

   To support the flow mobility, the BCE should be extended for
   containing the flow information.  Each BCE should contain the
   information of all flows generated from the MN.

   A BCE should be able to include multiple HNPs, each of which maps to
   multiple flows.  Each flow is bound to a specific Proxy-CoA.  With
   this extension, the flow can be moved from one path to another path
   by simply updating new Proxy-CoA.  The LMA should be able to look up
   BCE based on not only the HNP but also the Flow-ID.

5.3.  Prefix model for the logical interface

   Since the logical interface hides multiple physical interfaces from
   the IP stack, the HNPs are assigned to the logical interface only.
   It means that the LMA can send/receive packets of an HNP to/from the
   MN via any physical interfaces that is abstracted by the logical
   interface.

               Figure 4: Use case with address configuration

   The figure1 shows an example.  The MN attaches to the network using
   two physical interfaces with 3GPP and WiFi access technologies.
   These two physical interfaces (PIs) are abstracted by a logical
   interface (LGI).  The LGI is assigned Home Network Prefix 1 (HNP1)
   and it has a global address, HNP1::LGI_MAC/128, where LGI_MAC is the
   link-layer address of the LGI.  The mobile node sends voice traffic
   via the PI1, and video traffic via the PI2.  Both of two flows use
   the same HNP1.  This example is based on the shared-prefix model
   where an HNP can be shared across multiple interfaces.

5.4.  Signaling considerations

5.4.1.  Processing Proxy Binding Updates messages

   In this section we introduce the additional processing rules to
   support flow mobility.  First, the LMA analyzes the PBU message to
   check if the flow mobility trigger is activated.  If yes, then the
   LMA will perform flow mobility procedure.




Tran, et al.            Expires January 13, 2011               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft     Flow tracking procedure for PMIPv6          July 2010


   o  If the LMA detects a new attachment from the MN, the LMA will look
      up all of the flows that the LMA is serving for the MN.  Then it
      checks the operator's policy and the application profile of each
      flow to decide which flow will be moved to the new attachment.
      The BCE entry will be updated with the new Proxy-CoA bound to this
      flow.  There are different ways that the LMA can detect the new
      attachment from the MN.  The following are three common cases that
      can be consider as the trigger of the new attachment case.

      *  The HI of 1 (New attachment).

      *  The HI is 4 and the ATT of PBU is different with the ATT stored
         in the corresponding BCE (New attachment with different access
         technology).

      *  The HI is 4 and the ATT of PBU is the same with the ATT stored
         in the corresponding BCE but the source address of PUB message
         is different from the Proxy-CoA stored in the BCE (New
         attachment with the same access technology).

   o  If the PBU message contains the information about new flows, the
      LMA will compare the information of these flows with the existing
      ones stored in the corresponding BCE.  If it is the same as one of
      the existing flow, the LMA will conclude that the mobile moved
      that flow to another link.  The LMA then updates the BCE to bind
      that flow to the Proxy-CoA of the MAG that sends the PBU message.

5.4.2.  Sending Proxy Binding Acknowledgement messages

   After the LMA updating the BCE to bind the flow to new Proxy-CoA, the
   LMA sends PBA message containing a flow mobility indicator that the
   LMA agrees to redirect flow via new MAG.  The PBA message is sent to
   both new and old MAG with the flow mobility flag value of 1 and 2
   respectively.  On receiving PBA message, the MAG will check the flow
   mobility flag to perform flow binding registration or de-registration
   as discussed in the next section.


6.  MAG extensions

6.1.  Flow identifier management

   Like the LMA, the MAG should be also extended to manage the flow
   information.  The description of a flow is the n-tuple information
   including [Source Address, Destination Address, Source Port,
   Destination Port, and Protocol] and the other information such as
   flow-label, traffic-class, etc.  The MAG generates a unique ID for
   each flow using the same algorithm as the LMA uses.  This ID will be

Internet-Draft     Flow tracking procedure for PMIPv6          July 2010


   included in BULE to represent the flow.  The MAG also maintains a
   table mapping between a Flow-ID and a Flow description.  After a
   specific time, if the MAG do not receive any packet that has the same
   header information as any of the flow description in this table, the
   corresponding record in the table will be removed.

6.2.  Binding Update List Entry extension

   Similar as BCE, the binding update list entry should be extended to
   include the flow information (e.g., Flow ID).  A BULE includes
   multiple HNPs, each of which map to multiple flows.  Each flow is
   bound to a specific tunnel-if-id.

6.3.  Signaling consideration

6.3.1.  Sending Proxy Binding Update messages

   The MAG sends the extended PBU message with a flow mobility flag N.
   This flag is set to 1 if the MAG figures out that a new flow is sent
   from the MN.  Otherwise it is set to 0.  If the flag is 1 then the
   PBU will include the identification of the new flow.

6.3.2.  Processing Flow Binding Acknowledgement

   When the MAG receives PBA messages, it will check the flow indicator
   flag value to perform flow binding registration or de-registration as
   follows:

   o  If it is 0 then the MAG adds the flow information to the BULE and
      binds it to the tunnel-if-id that has an end point similar with
      the address of the LMA that sends PBA message as well as created
      routing state for tunneling that flow.

   o  If the flag value is 1 then the MAG removes the flow information
      from the BULE and removes the created routing state for tunneling
      that flow.


7.  Message format extensions

   To support flow mobility, the signaling messages between LMA and MAG
   should be extend to contain the extra information of flows.  In this
   section we discuss about the necessary extensions of PBU and PBA
   messages.

   o  The fist flag 'S' is used to indicate that the LMA processed flow
      mobility update and it wants to inform the old MAG and new MAG of
      that.

   o  The second flag 'F' is considered only when the 'S' flag is set to
      1.  The flag is set to '0' in case that the LMA wants to send a
      PBA message to the old MAG to de-register the flows that are moved
      to the new MAG.  It is set to '1' if the LMA wants to send a PBA
      message to the new MAG to register new flows.  A new mobility
      option is also added to contain the identification of the flows
      that are move to the new MAG.
