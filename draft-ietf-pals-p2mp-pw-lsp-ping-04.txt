                  draft-ietf-pals-p2mp-pw-lsp-ping-04

Abstract

   LSP-Ping is a widely deployed Operation, Administration, and
   Maintenance (OAM) mechanism in MPLS networks.  This document
   describes a mechanism to verify connectivity of Point-to-Multipoint
   (P2MP) Pseudowires (PW) using LSP Ping.

1.  Introduction

   A Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) Pseudowire (PW) emulates the essential
   attributes of a unidirectional P2MP Telecommunications service such
   as P2MP ATM over Public Switched Network (PSN).  Requirements for
   P2MP PW are described in [RFC7338].  P2MP PWs are carried over P2MP
   MPLS LSP.  The Procedures for P2MP PW signaling using BGP are
   described in [RFC7117] and LDP for single segment P2MP PWs are
   described in [I-D.ietf-pals-p2mp-pw].  Many P2MP PWs can share the
   same P2MP MPLS LSP and this arrangement is called Aggregate P2MP
   Tree.  An aggregate P2MP tree requires an upstream assigned label so
   that on the tail of the P2MP LSP, the traffic can be associated with
   a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or a Virtual Private LAN Service
   (VPLS) instance.  When a P2MP MPLS LSP carries only one VPN or VPLS
   service instance, the arrangement is called Inclusive P2MP Tree.  For
   Inclusive P2MP Tree, P2MP MPLS LSP label itself can uniquely identify
   the VPN or VPLS service being carried over P2MP MPLS LSP.  The P2MP
   MPLS LSP can also be used in Selective P2MP Tree arrangement for
   carrying multicast traffic.  In a Selective P2MP Tree arrangement,
   traffic to each multicast group in a VPN or VPLS instance is carried
   by a separate unique P2MP LSP.  In Aggregate Selective P2MP Tree
   arrangement, traffic to a set of multicast groups from different VPN
   or VPLS instances is carried over the same shared P2MP LSP.

   The P2MP MPLS LSP are setup either using P2MP RSVP-TE [RFC4875] or
   Multipoint LDP (mDLP) [RFC6388].  Mechanisms for fault detection and
   isolation for data plane failures for P2MP MPLS LSPs are specified in

   [RFC6425].  This document describes a mechanism to detect data plane
   failures for P2MP PW carried over P2MP MPLS LSPs.

   This document defines a new P2MP Pseudowire sub-TLV for Target FEC
   Stack for P2MP PW.  The P2MP Pseudowire sub-TLV is added in Target
   FEC Stack TLV by the originator of the Echo Request to inform the
   receiver at P2MP MPLS LSP tail of the P2MP PW being tested.

   Multi-segment Pseudowires support is out of scope of this document.

4.  Identifying a P2MP PW

   This document introduces a new LSP Ping Target FEC Stack sub-TLV,
   P2MP Pseudowire sub-TLV, to identify the P2MP PW under test at the
   P2MP LSP Tail/Bud node.

4.1.  P2MP Pseudowire Sub-TLV

   The P2MP Pseudowire sub-TLV has the format shown in Figure 1.  This
   TLV is included in the echo request sent over P2MP PW by the
   originator of request.

   The Attachment Group Identifier (AGI) in P2MP Pseudowire Sub-TLV as
   described in Section 3.4.2 in [RFC4446], identifies the VPLS
   instance.  The Originating Router's IP address is the IPv4 or IPv6
   address of the P2MP PW root.

                  Figure 1: P2MP Pseudowire sub-TLV format

   For Inclusive and Selective P2MP Trees, the echo request is sent
   using the P2MP MPLS LSP label.

   For Aggregate Inclusive and Aggregate Selective P2MP Trees, the echo
   request is sent using a label stack of [P2MP MPLS LSP label, upstream
   assigned P2MP PW label].  The P2MP MPLS LSP label is the outer label
   and upstream assigned P2MP PW label is inner label.

5.  Encapsulation of OAM Ping Packets

   The LSP Ping Echo request packet is encapsulated with the MPLS label
   stack as described in previous sections, followed by one of the two
   encapsulation options:

   o  GAL Label [RFC6426] followed by IPv4(0x0021) or IPv6(0x0057) type
      Associated Channel Header (ACH) [RFC4385]

   o  PW ACH [RFC4385]

   To ensure interoperability, implementations of this document MUST
   support both encapsulations.

6.  Operations

   In this section, we explain the operation of the LSP Ping over P2MP
   PW.  Figure 2 shows a P2MP PW PW1 setup from T-PE1 to remote PEs (T-
   PE2, T-PE3 and T-PE4).  The transport LSP associated with the P2MP
   PW1 can be mLDP P2MP MPLS LSP or P2MP TE tunnel.

Internet-Draft              P2MP PW LSP Ping                   July 2017


   When an operator wants to perform a connectivity check for the P2MP
   PW1, the operator initiate a LSP-Ping request with the Target FEC
   Stack TLV containing P2MP Pseudowire sub-TLV in the echo request
   packet.  For an Inclusive P2MP Tree arrangement, the echo request
   packet is sent over the P2MP MPLS LSP with one of the following two
   encapsulation options:

   o  {P2MP LSP label, GAL} MPLS label stack and IPv4 or IPv6 ACH.

   o  {P2MP LSP label} MPLS label stack and PW ACH.

   For an Aggregate Inclusive Tree arrangement, the echo request packet
   is sent over the P2MP MPLS LSP with one of the following two
   encapsulation options:

   o  {P2MP LSP label, P2MP PW upstream assigned label, GAL} MPLS label
      stack and IPv4 or IPv6 ACH.

   o  {P2MP LSP label, P2MP PW upstream assigned label} MPLS label stack
      and PW ACH.

   The intermediate P routers do swap and replication based on the MPLS
   LSP label.  Once the echo request packet reaches remote terminating
   PEs, T-PEs use GAL label and the IPv4/IPv6 ACH Channel header or PW
   ACH as the case may be, to determine that the packet is an OAM
   Packet.  The T-PEs process the packet and perform checks for the P2MP
   Pseudowire sub-TLV present in the Target FEC Stack TLV as described
   in Section 4.4 in [RFC8029] and respond according to [RFC8029]
   processing rules.

7.  Controlling Echo Responses

   The procedures described in [RFC6425] for preventing congestion of
   Echo Responses (Echo Jitter TLV in Section 3.3 of [RFC6425]) and
   limiting the echo reply to a single egress node (Node Address P2MP
   Responder Identifier TLV in Section 3.2 [RFC6425]) should be applied
   to P2MP PW LSP Ping.

8.  Security Considerations

   The proposal introduced in this document does not introduce any new
   security considerations beyond those that already apply to [RFC6425].

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new sub-TLV type to be included in Target FEC
   Stack TLV (TLV Type 1) [RFC8029] in LSP Ping.
