       Sieve Email Filtering: Delivering to Special-Use Mailboxes
                 draft-ietf-extra-sieve-special-use-04

Abstract

   The SPECIAL-USE capability of the IMAP protocol (RFC 6154) allows
   clients to identify special-use mailboxes; e.g., where draft or sent
   messages should be put.  This simplifies client configuration.  In
   contrast, the Sieve mail filtering language (RFC 5228) currently has
   no such capability.  This memo defines a Sieve extension that fills
   this gap: it adds a test for checking whether a special-use attribute
   is assigned for a particular mailbox or any mailbox, and it adds the
   ability to file messages into an anonymous mailbox that has a
   particular special-use attribute assigned.

1.  Introduction

   Commonly, several mailboxes in an IMAP message store [IMAP] have a
   special use; e.g.  it is where the user's draft messages are stored,
   where a copy of sent messages are kept, or it is where spam messages
   are filed automatically at delivery.  The SPECIAL-USE capability
   [SPECIAL-USE] of the IMAP protocol defines mailbox attributes that
   identify these special mailboxes explicitly to the client.  This way,
   client configuration is simplified significantly.  Using the CREATE-
   SPECIAL-USE capability [SPECIAL-USE], IMAP clients can also configure
   these attributes dynamically based on user preference.

   Unlike the IMAP protocol, the Sieve mail filtering language [SIEVE]
   currently cannot freely access these special-use mailbox attributes.
   Particularly, the Sieve interpreter cannot find an anonymous mailbox
   that has a particular special-use attribute assigned.  This would be
   very useful for example to find the user's Spam mailbox at delivery.

   In Sieve, limited access to the special-use attributes is provided
   using the "mboxmetadata" extension [SIEVE-MAILBOX], which allows
   testing for the presence of a special-use attribute in the "/private/
   specialuse" IMAP METADATA [IMAP-METADATA] entry of a mailbox.  Still,
   not all implementers will be willing to add the complexity of the

   IMAP METADATA capability, just to provide access to special-use
   attributes to the Sieve interpreter.

   This document defines an extension to the Sieve mail filtering
   language that adds the ability to freely access mailbox special-use
   attributes.  It adds a test called "specialuse_exists" that checks
   whether a special-use attribute is assigned for a particular mailbox
   or - if omitted - any of the user's personal mailboxes.  It also adds
   the ability to file messages into an anonymous personal mailbox that
   has a particular special-use attribute assigned using a ":specialuse"
   argument for the "fileinto" command [SIEVE].

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

   Conventions for notations are as in [SIEVE] Section 1.1, including
   use of the "Usage:" label for the definition of action and tagged
   arguments syntax.

   In [IMAP] examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client
   and server respectively.  If such lines are wrapped without a new
   "C:" or "S:" label, then the wrapping is for editorial clarity and is
   not part of the command.

3.  Test "specialuse_exists"

   Usage:  specialuse_exists [<mailbox: string>]
                             <special-use-flags: string-list>

   If the "mailbox" string argument is omitted, the "specialuse_exists"
   test yields true if all of the following statements are true for each
   of the special-use flags listed in the "special-use-flags" argument:

   a.  at least one mailbox exists in the user's personal namespace
       [NAMESPACE] that has that particular special-use flag assigned,
       and

   b.  that mailbox allows the user in whose context the Sieve script
       runs to "deliver" messages into it.

   If the "mailbox" argument is specified, the "specialuse_exists" test
   yields true if all of the following statements are true:

   a.  the indicated mailbox exists,

Internet-Draft        Sieve: Special-Use Mailboxes         November 2018


   b.  that mailbox allows the user in whose context the Sieve script
       runs to "deliver" messages into it, and

   c.  that mailbox has all of the special-use flags listed in the
       "special-use-flags" argument assigned to it.

   Refer to the specification of the "mailboxexists" test in Section 3.1
   of RFC 5490 [SIEVE-MAILBOX] for a definition of when "delivery" of
   messages into a mailbox is deemed possible.

3.1.  Equivalent IMAP Operations

   To clarify, a sequence of [IMAP] commands that a client could send to
   perform an assessment without Sieve that is equivalent to the
   "specialuse_exists" test is shown in the following IMAP protocol
   examples.

   First, the client queries which namespaces are available using the
   NAMESPACE command [NAMESPACE]:

   C: A01 NAMESPACE
   S: * NAMESPACE (("INBOX/" "/")("Archive/" "/")) NIL (("Public/" "/"))
   S: A01 OK NAMESPACE command completed

   Subsequently, when no particular mailbox is of interest (i.e., the
   "specialuse_exists" test has no mailbox argument), the client lists
   all mailboxes with special-use flags in the two returned personal
   namespaces (this extended LIST command requires the LIST-EXTENDED
   IMAP capability [LIST-EXTENDED]):

   C: A02 LIST (SPECIAL-USE) "" ("INBOX/*" "Archive/*")
       RETURN (SPECIAL-USE)
   S: * LIST (\Drafts) "/" INBOX/Drafts
   S: * LIST (\Trash) "/" INBOX/Trash
   S: * LIST (\Sent) "/" INBOX/Sent
   S: * LIST (\Archive) "/" Archive/Default
   S: A02 OK LIST command completed

   Finally, using the MYRIGHTS command [IMAP-ACL], the client determines
   the access rights it has for the mailbox or mailboxes that have all
   the requested flags assigned.  This way, it can determine whether
   messages can be saved to any of those.  In this example, an
   "\Archive" special-use mailbox is sought:

   C: A03 MYRIGHTS Archive/Default
   S: * MYRIGHTS Archive/Default lrwsip
   S: A03 OK Myrights completed




Bosch                     Expires May 31, 2019                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft        Sieve: Special-Use Mailboxes         November 2018


   The MYRIGHTS response indicates that the the user has "insert" rights
   [IMAP-ACL] for the "Archive/Default" mailbox, meaning that the client
   can deliver (APPEND) messages to that mailbox and that the Sieve
   "specialuse_exists" test would yield "true" in this case.

4.  ":specialuse" Argument to "fileinto" Command

   Usage:  fileinto [:specialuse <special-use-flag: string>]
                    <mailbox: string>

   Normally, the "fileinto" command delivers the message in the mailbox
   specified using its positional mailbox argument.  However, if the
   optional ":specialuse" argument is also specified, the "fileinto"
   command first checks whether a mailbox exists in the user's personal
   namespace [NAMESPACE] with the specified special-use flag assigned to
   it.  If that is the case, that special-use mailbox is used for
   delivery instead.  If there is no such mailbox or if the specified
   special-use flag is unknown to the implementation in general, the
   "fileinto" action proceeds as it would without the ":specialuse"
   argument.

   Summarizing, if the ":specialuse" argument is specified, the fileinto
   command deals with two mailboxes that may or may not exist:

   o  An anonymous special-use mailbox in the user's personal namespace,
      which has at least the special-use flag specified with the
      ":specialuse" argument assigned to it.

   o  The default mailbox named by the positional string argument of the
      "fileinto" command, which is used when the special-use mailbox is
      not found.

   The special-use flag specified with the ":specialuse" argument MUST
   conform to the "use-attr" syntax described in Section 6 of RFC6154
   [SIEVE-MAILBOX].  Implementations SHOULD handle an invalid special-
   use flag in the same way as an invalid mailbox name is handled.  The
   string parameter of the ":specialuse" argument is not a constant
   string, which means that variable substitutions are allowed when the
   "variables" extension [VARIABLES] is active.  In that case, the
   syntax of the special-use flag is only verified at runtime.

   If neither the special-use mailbox nor the default mailbox exists,
   the "fileinto" action MUST proceed exactly as it does in case the
   ":specialuse" is argument is absent and the mailbox named by its
   positional argument does not exist.  The various options for handling
   this situation are described in Section 4.1 of RFC5228 [SIEVE].

Internet-Draft        Sieve: Special-Use Mailboxes         November 2018


   More than one mailbox in the user's personal namespace can have a
   particular special-use flag assigned.  If one of those mailboxes is
   in fact the default mailbox named by the positional string argument
   of the "fileinto" command, that mailbox MUST be used for delivery.
   If the default mailbox is not one of the options, the mailbox that is
   chosen for delivery is implementation-defined.  However, while the
   set of mailboxes to which the involved special-use flags are assigned
   remains unchanged, implementations SHOULD ensure that the mailbox
   choice is made consistently, so that the same mailbox is used every
   time.  Conversely, the chosen mailbox MAY change once the special-use
   flag assignments that are relevant for the mailbox choice are changed
   (usually by user interaction).

   If delivery to the special-use mailbox fails for reasons not relating
   to its existence, the Sieve interpreter MUST NOT subsequently attempt
   delivery in the indicated default mailbox as a fall-back.  Instead,
   it MUST proceed exactly as it does in case the ":specialuse" argument
   is absent and delivery to the mailbox named by its positional
   argument fails.  This prevents the situation where messages are
   unexpectedly spread over two mailboxes in case transient or
   intermittent delivery failures occur.

4.1.  Mailboxes Created Implicitly by the "fileinto" Command

   Before attempting to deliver the message into the specified mailbox,
   the "fileinto" command may implicitly create the mailbox if it does
   not exist (see Section 4.1 of RFC5228 [SIEVE]).  This optional
   behavior can be requested explicitly using the "mailbox" extension
   [SIEVE-MAILBOX], which adds the optional ":create" argument to the
   "fileinto" command.  If the ":create" argument is specified with
   "fileinto", it instructs the Sieve interpreter to unconditionally
   create the specified mailbox if needed.  Note that the ":create"
   argument has no effect when the implicit creation of mailboxes for
   delivery is the default behavior.

   When the ":specialuse" argument is present, this behavior does not
   change: the Sieve interpreter will implicitly create the specified
   default mailbox if needed.  This need arises when both the special-
   use mailbox and the default mailbox are not found.

   If the server implementation supports the CREATE-SPECIAL-USE
   capability [SPECIAL-USE] for IMAP (i.e., it allows assigning special-
   use flags to new mailboxes) it SHOULD assign the special-use flag
   specified with the ":specialuse" argument to the newly created
   mailbox.

4.2.  Equivalent IMAP Operations

   To clarify, a sequence of [IMAP] commands that a client could send to
   perform an action without Sieve that is equivalent to the "fileinto"
   action with the ":specialuse" argument is shown in the following IMAP
   protocol examples.  The following Sieve script is assumed:

   require "fileinto";
   require "special-use";

   fileinto :specialuse "\\Archive" "INBOX/Archive";

   First, the client proceeds as in Section 3.1 to find out whether the
   indicated special-use flag is assigned to any mailbox in the user's
   personal namespace.  If a matching special-use mailbox is found, the
   message is delivered there using the IMAP APPEND command.  If no
   matching special-use mailbox is found, the client attempts to deliver
   the message to the indicated default mailbox:

   C: A04 APPEND INBOX/Archive {309}
   S: A04 NO [TRYCREATE] Mailbox does not exist: Archive/Personal

   In this example, the default mailbox does not exist either.  In that
   case, the client MAY create the default mailbox and assign the
   indicated special-use flag to it:

   C: A05 CREATE INBOX/Archive (USE (\Archive))
   S: A05 OK Create completed

   Finally, the client completes the delivery:

   C: A06 APPEND INBOX/Archive {309}
   S: + OK

5.  Sieve Capability Strings

   A Sieve implementation that defines the "specialuse_exists" test and
   the ":specialuse" argument for the "fileinto" command will advertise
   the capability string "special-use".

6.  Examples

   The following example saves the message in the mailbox where messages
   deemed to be junk mail are held.  This mailbox is identified using
   the "\Junk" special-use attribute.  If no mailbox has this attribute
   assigned, the message is filed into the mailbox named "Spam".  If the
   mailbox named "Spam" does not exist either, the result of this Sieve
   script is implementation-dependent: e.g., it may trigger an error or
   the mailbox may be created implicitly.

   require "fileinto";
   require "special-use";

   fileinto :specialuse "\\Junk" "Spam";

   The following very similar example explicitly handles the case in
   which neither a "\Junk" special-use mailbox nor the "Spam" mailbox
   exist.  In that case, a mailbox called "Spam" is created, and the
   message is stored there.  Additionally, the "\Junk" special-use
   attribute may be assigned to it.

   require "fileinto";
   require "special-use";
   require "mailbox";

   fileinto :specialuse "\\Junk" :create "Spam";

   The following example is used in a Sieve script that is triggered
   from an IMAP event, rather than at message delivery [IMAPSIEVE].
   This Sieve script redirects messages to an automated recipient that
   processes junk mail, if those messages are copied or moved into a
   mailbox that has the "\Junk" special-use attribute assigned.

       environment "imap.cause" "COPY",
       specialuse_exists "${mailbox}" "\\Junk") {
       redirect "spam-report@example.org";
   }

7.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations are discussed in [SIEVE], [VARIABLES], and
   [SPECIAL-USE].  It is believed that this extension does not introduce
   any additional security concerns.

   Note that this specification explicitly restricts the anonymous
   special-use mailbox to the user's personal namespace.  First, this
   avoids the need to search the entire mail storage for mailboxes that
   have a particular special-use flag assigned.  This could put undue
   load on the system, while shared special-use mailboxes are deemed of
   limited use with the currently defined special-use flags.  Secondly,
   it prevents security concerns with shared mailboxes that have
   special-use flags assigned that apply to all users.  Searching the
   entire mail storage for special-use mailboxes could lead to messages
   unexpectedly or even maliciously being filed to shared mailboxes.

   This restriction could be lifted for particular future special-use
   flags, but such new flags should have a clear application for shared
   mailboxes and the security concerns should be considered carefully.

8.  IANA Considerations

   The following template specifies the IANA registration of the Sieve
   extension specified in this document:
