   important functionality that needs to be provided in the Internet.
   This document proposes the definition of a new NSIS Signaling Layer
   Protocol (NSLP), named Metering NSLP, which allows the dynamic
   configuration of Metering Entities on the data path.  An accompanying
   document [I-D.fessi-nsis-m-nslp-framework] makes a problem statement,
   describes scenarios where such a path-coupled configuration of
   Metering Entities would be useful, elaborates requirements and
   discusses the applicability of NSIS to the problem.  This document
   suggests a Metering NSIS protocol design, defines Metering NSLP
   messages, outlines protocol operation and discusses commonalities and
   differences to other NSLPs.

1.  Introduction

   Monitoring, metering and accounting of packets is an important
   functionality in many networks today.  Several working groups have
   described mechanisms to collect and report usage data for resource
   consumption in a network by a particular entity.  For example, the
   IPFIX WG defines a protocol to collect such data.  The PSAMP WG
   defines a standard to sample subsets of packets by statistical and
   other methods.  RADIUS (see [RFC2865] and [RFC2866]) and DIAMETER
   (see [RFC3588] and [I-D.ietf-aaa-diameter-cc]) are also protocols
   which provide information about consumed resources.  The Meter MIB
   [RFC2720] is a MIB for collecting flow information.

   However, it is also necessary to configure and coordinate the
   entities performing the metering.  RADIUS, DIAMETER and SNMP are
   candidates for this configuration.  Nevertheless, these protocols
   require some knowledge about the location of the appropriate Metering
   Entities to configure them.

   In more complex network topologies and architectures the appropriate
   entities to meter a given data flow can be discovered dynamically
   using path-coupled signaling.  If more than one Metering Entity is
   required, all of them can potentially be configured and coordinated
   with a single message along the path.

   Scenarios and requirements for Metering NSLP are described in
   [I-D.fessi-nsis-m-nslp-framework].

   This draft introduces the Metering NSLP for configuration and
   coordination of Metering Entities in a path-coupled fashion.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Furthermore, this document uses the following terms:

   Metering Record

      A Metering Record describes flow characteristics for a particular
      flow.  Examples for such data are packet counter, time
      information.

Internet-Draft                Metering NSLP                    July 2005


   Monitoring Probe

      A Monitoring Probe is an entity that examines the data flow in
      order to gather Metering Records.  These Metering Records are
      exported to a Collector.

   Metering Entity

      A Metering Entity is a node that is equiped with one or more
      Monitoring Probes.  A Metering Entity MAY host other functions as
      in Figure 1 below, such as Metering Manager, M-NSLP Processing,
      etc.  Note however, that the Collector is typically not co-located
      with the Metering Entity and an other protocol (e.g.  IPFIX) is
      needed to report the Metering Records to the Collector.

   Collector

      A Collector receives Metering Records from one or multiple
      Metering Entities.  These Metering Records can be aggregated
      and/or correlated by the Collector.

   Metering Configuration State

      State used/kept by the Metering Manager to configure the
      Monitoring Probe.

   Metering Manager

      A unit co-located with the Monitoring Probe that communicates with
      M-NSLP processing.  It holds Metering Configuration State which is
      used to configure the Monitoring Probe.

   MNE

      An NSIS Entity (NE) which supports the Metering NSLP.

   MNI

      The first node in the sequence of MNEs that issues a configuration
      message for a flow or aggregate.

   MNR

      The last node in the sequence of MNEs that receives a
      configuration message for a flow or aggregate.

Internet-Draft                Metering NSLP                    July 2005


   MNF

      A MNE that is neither MNI nor MNR.


3.  Basic Protocol Design

   The design for the Metering NSLP and the processing of M-NSLP
   messages is similar to QoS NSLP.  The main difference compared to the
   QoS NSLP is that only a subset (in some cases even only one) of the
   Metering Entities in the signaling path will take part of the actual
   Metering.  This fact has several consequences on the signaling itself
   and therefore on the protocol design.

3.1  Model of operation

   Figure 1 shows an example logical model of the operation of Metering
   NSLP and the associated metering mechanism in a MNE.

   The Monitoring Probe collects measurement data and processes them
   into Metering Records.  These Metering Records can be sent to the
   Collector.  The Monitoring Probe is co-located with the Input Packet
   Processing and the Outgoing Interface.

   A M-NSLP message called CONFIGURE transports:
   a.  appropriate information to determine which MNEs on the path need
       to take part of the metering
   b.  metering configuration information

   The M-NSLP processing decides based on a. if the current MNE is
   addressed by this configuring message.  If yes, the metering
   configuration information is extracted from the M-NSLP message and



Dressler, et al.    draft-dressler-nsis-metering-nslp-02.txt    [Page 8]

   passed to the Metering Manager, where it is interpreted and used to
   install Metering Configuration State.  The Metering Manager uses this
   state to configure the Monitoring Probe.

   The Policy Control determines whether the sender of the M-NSLP
   message is authorized to configure the Monitoring Probe.

   From the perspective of a single node, the request for configuration
   of Metering Entities may result from processing a local management
   request, or from processing an incoming M-NSLP message.  The local
   management may in turn be triggered by a local application, e.g. a
   video being requested from a video server, or by a physically
   separate knowledgeable network node.

3.2  Protocol overview

3.2.1  Metering NSLP Message types

   The Metering NSLP messages are classified into 3 categories:
   o  request messages
   o  response messages
   o  asynchronous notifications


3.2.1.1  Request Messages

   CONFIGURE

      CONFIGURE is a request message.  It is used to create Metering
      Configuration State in a Metering Entity.  The CONFIGURE message
      is idempotent; the resultant effect on the Metering Configuration
      State and on the M-NSLP state is the same whether a message is
      received once or many times.

   REFRESH

      The REFRESH message is a request message that is used for 2
      reasons:
      *  First, to extend the lifetime of an existing M-NSLP session if
         required.
      *  Second, REFRESH messages are used to inspect if the MNEs that
         are involved in the metering process are still taking part of
         it.  This might not be the case, for example, if a re-routing
         event has happened and one of the involved MNEs in not on the
         path anymore.
      *  Third, for terminating a session.

3.2.1.2  Response Messages

   RESPONSE

      The RESPONSE message is used to provide information about the
      result of a previous M-NSLP message.  This includes explicit
      confirmation of the state manipulation signaled in the CONFIGURE
      message, the response to a REFRESH message or an error code if a
      MNE is unable to provide the requested information or if the
      response is negative.
      The RESPONSE message is idempotent; the resultant effect on the
      Metering Configuration State and on the M-NSLP state is the same
      whether a message is received once or many times.


3.2.1.3  Asynchronous Notifications

   NOTIFY

      The NOTIFY message is used to convey information to a MNE.  It
      differs from RESPONSE messages in that it is sent asynchronously
      and need not refer to any particular state or previously received
      message.  The information conveyed by a NOTIFY message is
      typically related to error conditions.  An example would be
      notification to an upstream peer about state being torn down.


   Each Metering NSLP message has a common header which indicates the
   message type and contains flags.  The parameters carried in each of
   the Metering NSLP messages are defined in Section 4.1.  Message
   Processing Rules are defined in Section 4.3.4.

   Metering NSLP messages contain three types of objects:

   Control Information

      Control information objects carry general information for the
      M-NSLP Processing, such as sequence numbers and whether the MNE
      should actually take part of the Metering.

   Metering specification (MSPEC)

      MSPEC objects describe the actual Configuration information.  They
      are interpreted in the Metering Manager and SHOULD be opaque to
      M-NSLP Processing.

Internet-Draft                Metering NSLP                    July 2005


   Policy objects

      Policy objects contain data used to authenticate M-NSLP messages
      and authorize the configuration of the MNEs.  They are interpreted
      by Policy Control.


   Detailed information about the Metering NSLP objects can be found in
   Section 4.2.

3.3  Design Decisions

3.3.1  Soft State

   NSIS State is always soft state and needs to be refreshed.  The
   Control Information carries an object that determines the life time
   of M-NSLP state.  The MNI suggests a lifetime for the session that it
   is being signaled for.  Each MNE participating in the metering
   process may or may not accept the suggested lifetime or may start the
   metering with a reduced lifetime, depending on the local policies of
   the MNEs.  This behavior is very similar to to the calculation of
   Session Lifetime in NATFW-NSLP [I-D.ietf-nsis-nslp-natfw].

3.3.2  Message Sequencing

   The order in which CONFIGURE messages arrive influences the eventual
   configuration state that will be stored at a MNE.  Therefore M-NSLP
   supports the detection of CONFIGURE message duplication and re-
   ordering using a Message Sequence Number (MSN).

3.3.3  Message Scoping

   In order to realize the requirement of scoping of M-NSLP messages up
   to a certain types of Metering Entities, it is necessary to have an
   abstract language that can characterize Metering Entity types.

   When a M-NSLP processing recognizes that the Metering Entity is of
   the type specified, it terminates the signaling.  The MNE acts as a
   Signaling Responder.

3.3.4  Rerouting

   M-NSLP automatically adapts to rerouting events because state along
   the old path times out, and a new CONFIGURE message with the same
   SESSION_ID will install state along the new path.

   For M-NSLP it is generally not important to quickly tear down
   configuration state along the old path, however for some



Dressler, et al.    draft-dressler-nsis-metering-nslp-02.txt    [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                Metering NSLP                    July 2005


   applications, e.g. accounting, it is vital to quickly configure MNEs
   on the new path.

3.3.5  Selection of MNEs

   An interesting feature of the Metering NSLP is that only a subset of
   MNEs on the data path might take part in the actual metering.
   Metering Entities taking part in the metering process are determined
   based, for example, on their type, number or position on the path.
   This feature is the most striking difference to the QoS NSLP with a
   number of implications.

   When the first CONFIGURE message is sent, each MNE on the data path
   needs to determine whether it should take part in the metering
   process or not.  For this reason, we need the object MNE_Selection in
   the CONFIGURE message.

   When the MNE finds out it is not involved in the metering, it does
   not need to install, neither Metering Configuration State, nor M-NSLP
   state.  (For clarification, see here Section 4.3.1 where the
   different state information that an MNE needs to store is
   illustrated).

3.3.6  Refreshing Sessions

   Refreshing M-NSLP sessions is required for several reasons.
   o  First, to extend the lifetime of an existing M-NSLP session if
      required.
   o  Second, by refreshing M-NSLP sessions, it can be inspected if the
      MNEs that are involved in the metering process are still metering.
      This might not be the case, for example, if a re-routing event has
      happened and one of the involved MNEs in not on the path anymore.

   To realize the latter requirement, we introduce the Metering NSLP
   message REFRESH, which differs from the CONFIGURE message.

   After a REFRESH message travels all the way from the MNI to the MNR,
   the MNR responds with a RESPONSE message where MNEs can write their
   current status.  Each MNE that is involved in the metering process
   marks an appropriate field reserved for it in the RESPONSE message to
   say "METERING".  For this reason we use the Status_List object in the
   Metering NSLP that is used by the RESPONSE message.

   MNEs that are not taking part of the metering process have not
   installed any M-NSLP state for this session and are agnostic about
   it.  These MNEs will just forward the REFRESH/RESPONSE message
   towards the MNR/MNI.




Dressler, et al.    draft-dressler-nsis-metering-nslp-02.txt    [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                Metering NSLP                    July 2005


   When the RESPONSE message arrives at the MNI, the MNI verifies if the
   previously selected MNEs are still involved.  If not, the MNI can re-
   initiates the signaling with a CONFIGURE message with the same
   SESSION_ID and the same Correlation-ID (if there is one
   Correlation-ID in the MSPEC objects).

3.3.7  Aggregation

   The metering configuration should allow aggregation of Metering
   Records belonging to the same user or application.  The information
   required for the aggregation must be specified in the MSPEC.  Such
   aggregation can be done in two ways.
   o  A Monitoring Probe separately collects and reports data for each
      micro flow (e.g., given for all different combinations of port
      numbers) contained in the macro flow that is signaled by the NTLP.
   o  A Monitoring Probe separately collects micro flows but reports all
      flows in a single record.

4.  Metering NSLP Functional Specification

4.1  Metering NSLP Message Structure

   As in other NSLPs, Metering NSLP messages consists of a common
   header, followed by a body consisting of a variable number of
   variable-length, typed "objects".  The common header and other
   objects are encapsulated together in a GIMPS NSLP-Data object.

   The following subsections define the objects carried in each of the
   Metering NSLP messages.

4.1.1  CONFIGURE

   The CONFIGURE message carries the following objects:
   o  SESSION_ID: A large identifier provided by GIMPS or set locally.
   o  Message Sequence Number (MSN)
   o  MNE_Selection: this object is required to determine which MNEs
      will actually take part of the metering.
   o  MNE_Counter: this parameter is used to count how many MNEs on the
      path are participating in the metering process.  Each MNE that is
      participating in the metering process increments this parameter by
      one.
   o  MSPEC: the MSPEC objects determine the actual configuration.  The
      MSPEC SHOULD be opaque to the Metering NSLP.
   o  Session Lifetime: this object gives the requested lifetime for a
      M-NSLP session.

Internet-Draft                Metering NSLP                    July 2005


4.1.2  REFRESH

   The REFRESH message carries the following objects:
   o  SESSION_ID: this parameter refers to the same SESSION_ID given in
      the initial CONFIGURE message in the Metering NSLP session.
   o  Message Sequence Number (MSN)
   o  MNE_Counter: this parameter is used to count how many MNEs on the
      path are participating in the metering process.  Each MNE that is
      participating in the metering process increments this parameter by
      one.
   o  Session Lifetime: this object gives the requested lifetime to
      extend the M-NSLP session.

4.1.3  RESPONSE

   The RESPONSE message carries the following objects:
   o  Message Sequence Number (MSN): the MNR MUST send the same MSN as
      in the corresponding M-NSLP request message in order to match a
      RESPONSE to the appropriate request message.
   o  MNE_Selection: in some scenarios the actual MNEs that will take
      part of the metering are not determined until the RESPONSE message
      arrives.  For this reason, the parameter MNE_Selection might be
      required.
   o  Status_List: This object contains one field of the size of one
      byte for each MNE participating in the metering process.  Each
      participating MNE can store its status in the appropriate field
      reserved for it.  The size of Status_List can be interpreted from
      the value of MNE_Counter.  The status can be, for example,
      "METERING", "NO DATA" or "OVERLOADED".
   o  ERROR_CODE: this object is required if the configuration can not
      be achieved successfully.

4.1.4  NOTIFY

   A NOTIFY message MUST contain an ERROR_SPEC object indicating the
   reason for the notification.

4.2  Metering NSLP Objects

4.2.1  Message Sequence Number (MSN)

   As mentioned above, the Message Sequence Number is used to detect
   duplicate Metering NSLP messages.

4.2.2  MNE_Selection Object

   As mentioned above, this parameter is required to determine which
   MNEs will actually take part of the metering.  The value of the



Dressler, et al.    draft-dressler-nsis-metering-nslp-02.txt    [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                Metering NSLP                    July 2005


   MNE_Selection parameter can be one of the following:

   o  FIRST: the first MNE in the signaling path, i.e. the NI.

   o  LAST: the last MNE signaling in the signaling path, i.e. the NR

   o  'FIRST and LAST': both the NI and the NR take part of the
      signaling.

   o  ANY: one MNE should be arbitrarily chosen to perform the metering.

   o  ALL: Each MNE capable of executing this metering request MUST
      perform it.  "ALL" must be interpreted here as "as many as
      possible". here

   o  Function_X: for this case, an abstract language to characterize
      the type of MNE is required.  Using this abstract language, the
      M-NSLP can evaluate if the MNE is of type "Fucntion_X" without
      knowing what actually "Function_X" is.  Note also, that the
      abstract language can be, for example, proprietary.  For more
      background information on why such an abstract language is
      required, please refer to Section "Accounting Scenario, Required
      Parameters" in [I-D.fessi-nsis-m-nslp-framework].

4.2.3  MNE_Counter Object

   This parameter is used to count how many MNEs on the path are
   participating in the metering process.  Each MNE that is
   participating in the metering process increments this parameter by
   one.  When a request message (CONFIGURE or REFRESH) arrives at the
   MNR, the object MNE_Counter will contain the number of the MNEs
   participating in the metering process along the signaling path.

4.2.4  Status_List Object

   This object is used for the RESPONSE message where each of the
   involved MNEs in the metering process has one field where it can
   store its current status.  The Status_List consists of one field of
   the size of one byte for each MNE participating in the metering
   process.  The status can be, for example, "METERING", "NO DATA" or
   "OVERLOADED".

   The size of the Status_List object is determined by the MNR based on
   the object MNE_Counter.

4.2.5  Session Lifetime Object

   This object gives the requested lifetime for a M-NSLP session in



Dressler, et al.    draft-dressler-nsis-metering-nslp-02.txt    [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                Metering NSLP                    July 2005


   seconds.  When a M-NSLP session expires, the Metering Manager MUST
   configure the Monitoring Probe to stop the Metering.  The
   corresponding Metering Configuration State is delete.

   A value of zero for this object leads to immediate termination of the
   corresponding session.

4.2.6  MSPEC Objects

   The MSPEC objects describe the actual Configuration information.
   They are interpreted in the Metering Manager and SHOULD be opaque to
   M-NSLP Processing.  The MSPEC objects MUST be extensible.  The order
   of objects is not defined, meaning that objects may occur in any
   sequence.  Currently, we define the MSPEC as follow:

   <MSPEC> = <Filters> <Metered Objects> <Correlation-Id>

   <Collector-Id> <FlowExpirationTime> <ExportPeriod>

   <Sampling-Alg-Id> <Sampling-Params>  <Hash Function>

4.2.6.1  The <Filters> Object

   <Filters> restricts the set of considered flows for the metering.
   The MSPEC MUST support a value for <Filters> that is different from
   the flow information kept at GIMPS.  In particular, the <Filters>
   value does not need to be an IP 5-tuple.  However, it could be, for
   example, a 5-tuple where one or more fields are wild-carded.

   For example, it MUST be possible to count all TCP SYN packets or all
   ICMP packets going to a given destination IP address.

4.2.6.2  The <Metered Objects> Object

   This parameter is represented as a set of flags that determines which
   information needs to be metered.

   <Metered Objects> = <Number-of-Packets Flag> <Number-of-Octets Flag>
   <Timestamp-Begin Flag> <Timestamp-End Flag>

   o  <Number-of-Packets Flag>: This field is set to 1 when the number
      of packets in the metered flow must be accounted.

   o  <Number-of-Octets Flag>: This flag is set to 1 when the number of
      octets in the metered flow must be accounted.






Dressler, et al.    draft-dressler-nsis-metering-nslp-02.txt    [Page 16]

Internet-Draft                Metering NSLP                    July 2005


   o  <Timestamp-Begin Flag>: This field is set to 1 when a timestamp at
      the arrival of the first packet in this flow must be recorded.

   o  <Timestamp-End Flag>: This field is set to 1 when a timestamp at
      the arrival of the last packet in this flow must be recorded.


4.2.6.3  The <Correlation-Id> Object

   As described in [I-D.fessi-nsis-m-nslp-framework], the Correlation-ID
   is an ID that identifies the measurement.  Reported Metering Records
   from different MNEs can be correlated by the Collector using this ID.
   The Correlation-ID MUST be unique for a specific measurement.  It
   MIGHT be generated by the NI or the NI MIGHT receive the
   Correlation-ID from an external entity which communicates with the NI
   using different means outside the scope of this document.

   The parameter <Correlation-Id> is not mandatory.  If a Correlation-Id
   is provided in the MSPEC objects, it will be provided to the
   Collector in the Metering Records.  Otherwise, the Metering Records
   will not contains a Correlation-ID.

4.2.6.4  The <Collector-Id> Object

   This parameter specifies where the Metering Records need to be sent
   to.

   The parameter <Collector-Id> is not mandatory since the Collector
   might be preconfigured in the MNE.  If no Collector is preconfigured
   in the MNE, the MNE SHOULD respond with an error message 'No
   Collector specified' (Error messages have not been investigated for
   the Metering NSLP yet).

4.2.6.5  The <Flow Expiration Time> Object

   If no packets are observed for the specified amount of time interval,
   the flow is considered as expired and it is reported.

   The <Flow Expiration Time> parameter is not mandatory, since it MIGHT
   be preconfigured in the MNE.

4.2.6.6  The <Reporting Interval> Object

   This parameter indicates the maximum time to wait for more data until
   an exported data set is sent.  Long living flows are reported
   regularly in interval no longer than specified by this parameter.
   When the flow is reported, all counters and time stamp values are
   reset.

Internet-Draft                Metering NSLP                    July 2005


   The <Reporting Interval> parameter is not mandatory since it might be
   preconfigured in the MNE.

4.2.6.7  The <Sampling-Alg> Object

   The <Sampling-Alg> object can take one of the following values:

   o  Select all

   o  Systematic count-based

   o  Systematic time-based

   o  Rand n out of N

   o  Uniform Probabilistic Sampling

   o  Non-Uniform Probabilistic Sampling

   o  Flow State Sampling

   o  Match Filtering

   o  Hash Filtering

   o  Router State Filtering


   The sampling algorithms themselves will not be illustrated in this
   document and can be inherited from the corresponding documents from
   the PSAMP Working Group.  ([I-D.ietf-psamp-sample-tech] [I-D.ietf-
   psamp-info] and [I-D.ietf-psamp-mib])

4.2.6.8  The <Samling-Params> Object

   Depending on the sampling algorithm, eventually some parameters are
   required for the algorithm.  Those can be specified here.

4.2.6.9  The Hash Function

   This parameter gives a function H which is applied to the packets
   before they are exported in the Metering Records.  H might be a hash
   function, a function that extracts some parts of the packets header
   and/or the payload or the Identity function (i.e. the complete packet
   is reported).

4.3  General Processing Rules

4.3.1  State Manipulation

   The state that needs to be stored at a MNE for a M-NSLP session can
   be of different types:

   o  NTLP state

   o  M-NSLP state

   o  Metering Configuration State


   As mentioned in Section 2, Metering Configuration State is the state
   used/kept by the Metering Manager to configure the Monitoring Probe.
   This consists of the parameters specified in the MSPEC section
   (Section 4.2.6).

   One of the attractive properties of the Metering NSLP is that MNEs
   that are not taking part of the metering do not need to install any
   M-NSLP state.  Nor do they need to install Metering Configuration
   State.  However, MNEs that are not taking part of the metering
   process still need to store NTLP state in order to avoid GIMPS re-
   discovering them each time when it refreshes its routing state.  For
   more details on how GIMPS refreshes its routing state, please see
   [I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp].

4.3.2  Message Forwarding

   M-NSLP request messages (CONFIGURE or REFRESH) are initiated by the
   MNI and forwarded downstream (i.e. in the same direction as the data
   flow) using GIMPS.

   When a MNE receives a request message, the message is forwarded
   downstream to the next MNE, except in 2 cases:
   o  the CONFIGURE message has reached the MNR.
   o  the involved MNEs in the configuration have been reached.

   The latter case can be for example:

   o  if the SCOPING flag is set and the CONFIGURE message has reached
      the end of the scope of the signaling.
   o  if MNE_Selection is 'ANY' and an appropriate MNE has been already
      found.
   o  if MNE_Selection is FIRST. (in this case, only the MNI is involved
      in the signaling)




Dressler, et al.    draft-dressler-nsis-metering-nslp-02.txt    [Page 19]

Internet-Draft                Metering NSLP                    July 2005


   In these cases, there is no need to forward the M-NSLP message
   further.

   M-NSLP response messages are forwarded upstream along the data path
   towards the MNI.

   M-NSLP asynchronous notifications can be sent upstream or downstream
   depending on the reason for the notification.

4.3.3  Standard Message Processing Rules

   If a mandatory object is missing from a message then the receiving
   MNE MUST NOT propagate the message any further.  It MUST construct an
   RESPONSE message indicating the error condition and send it back to
   towards the MNI.

   If a message contains an object of an unrecognized type, then the
   behavior depends on the object type value.

4.3.4  Message Processing Rules

4.3.4.1  The CONFIGURE Message

   When a MNE receives a CONFIGURE message, it performs the following
   steps:
   o  The MNE checks the message format.  In case of malformed messages,
      the MNE sends a RESPONSE message with the appropriate ERROR_SPEC.
   o  Before performing any state changing actions, the MNE MUST
      determine whether the sender of the request is authorized to
      perform this configuration action.
   o  After the CONFIGURE message is authorized, the MNE needs to figure
      out if it will take part of the metering or not based on the
      MNE_Selection object:
      *  If (MNE_Selection = FIRST) or (MNE_Selection = LAST) or
         (MNE_Selection = 'FIRST and LAST'), the MNE figures out if one
         these contraints equates to true.  If yes, the MSPEC is
         extracted from the CONFIGURE message and passed to the Metering
         Manager as shown in Figure 1.
      *  If (MNE_Selection = ALL) the MSPEC is extracted from the
         CONFIGURE message and passed to the Metering Manager.
      *  If MNE_Selection = 'ANY', the MNE verifies first if MNE_Counter
         is equal to one.  This means, it verifies, if there has been
         already one MNE on the path that is willing to take this task.
         If MNE_Counter is zero, the MNE verifies based on its current
         status (number of existing measurements, current load, etc) if
         it is able to perform the metering request.  If yes, the MSPEC
         is extracted from the CONFIGURE message and passed to the
         Metering Manager.



Dressler, et al.    draft-dressler-nsis-metering-nslp-02.txt    [Page 20]

Internet-Draft                Metering NSLP                    July 2005


   o  If the evaluation of MNE_Selection results in to not taking part
      of the metering, then the MNE does not store any Metering
      Configuration State.  Now, the MNE decides whether to forward the
      CONFIGURE message.  This decision is taken based on Section 4.3.2
   o  If the evaluation of MNE_Selection results in to taking part of
      the metering and the MSPEC is passed to the Metering Manager, the
      Metering Manager verifies if the Monitoring Probe is able to
      perform the metering based on the information in the MSPEC
      parameters, for example, if the requested export protocol is
      supported, and if the sampling algorithm is supported, etc.
   o  If the Metering Manager categorizes the metering request as
      feasible, it stores the Metering Configuration State and informs
      the M-NSLP processing.  Note however that the configuration is not
      activated, i.e. the Monitoring does not start the metering, until
      the MNE receives the matching RESPONSE.  Now, the MNE increments
      the parameter MNE_Counter by one to signal that it is taking part
      of the metering.  Afterwards, the MNE needs to decide whether to
      forward the CONFIGURE message or not.  Again here, this decision
      can be taken based on Section 4.3.2.
   o  If the evaluation of MNE_Selection results in to taking part of
      the metering, but the Metering Manager categorizes the metering
      request as NOT feasible, then:
      *  If (MNE_Selection = FIRST) or (MNE_Selection = LAST) or
         (MNE_Selection = 'FIRST and LAST') and the MNE is indeed the
         first or the last MNE on the signaling path, then the MNE
         constructs	a RESPONSE message with the appropriate ERROR_SPEC
         and sends it back towards the MNI.  Otherwise, the MNE forwards
         the message to the next MNE.
      *  If (MNE_Selection = ANY) and the message has reached the MNR,
         i.e. no appropriate MNE has been found on the path, then the
         MNE (which is in this case the MNR) constructs a RESPONSE
         message with the appropriate ERROR_SPEC and sends it back
         towards the MNI.  Otherwise, the MNE forwards the message to
         the next MNE.
      *  If (MNE_Selection = ALL), since "ALL" must be understood here
         as "as many as possible", the MNE does not need to generate a
         RESPONSE message with an ERROR_SPEC.  It just needs to forward
         the message to the next MNE.

4.3.4.2  The REFRESH Message

   Processing REFRESH messages is simple:
   o  If the SESSION_ID is known, the MNE verifies based on its local
      policies if the requested lifetime is allowed.  If not, the MNE
      adapts the time interval to its local policies.  Now, the MNE
      increments the parameter MNE_Counter by one to signal that it is
      still taking part of the metering.  Afterwards, the MNE decides
      whether to forward the REFRESH message to the next MNE on the



Dressler, et al.    draft-dressler-nsis-metering-nslp-02.txt    [Page 21]

Internet-Draft                Metering NSLP                    July 2005


      path.  This decision can be taken based on Section 4.3.2.  Note
      here, that the lifetime of the M-NSLP session is not extended
      until the corresponding RESPONSE message arrives.  Also note that
      a lifetime of zero lead to immediate termination of the session
      when the corresponding RESPONSE message arrives.
   o  If the SESSION_ID is unknown, i.e. the MNE has not stored any
      M-NSLP state for this session, the message is just forwarded to
      the next MNE on the path.

4.3.4.3  The RESPONSE Message

   If a RESPONSE message is a negative response with an ERRPR_SPEC
   object, the MNE just forwards the message towards the MNI.  When the
   MNI receives this message it has to take the appropriate action based
   on the content of the ERROR_SPEC object.

   If the RESPONSE message is a positive RESONSE, the processing of the
   message depends on the type of the corresponding M-NSLP request
   message (CONFIGURE or REFRESH).  However, in both cases, the RESPONSE
   message contains the object Status_List where the MNEs that are
   involved in the metering process can report their status.  This
   status can be, for example, "METERING", "NO DATA" or "OVERLOADED".

   Processing RESPONSE messages is described in several parts of this
   documents.  However, it still needs to be described more clearly in
   this section in future versions.

4.3.4.4  The NOTIFY Message

   tbd.

4.4  Session State Machine

   The state machine of a M-NSLP session has three main states:

   'session closed':

      At this state, the MNE does not keep any state of the session.

   'pending':

      At this state a CONFIGURE message has been received, the MNE has
      been successfully configured (i.e. authentication and
      authorization succeeded, the evaluation of MNE_Selection and the
      evaluation of the MSPEC objects by the Metering Manager were
      positive, etc.) however the configuration has not been activated
      yet, i.e. metering function has been started.

Internet-Draft                Metering NSLP                    July 2005


   'metering':

      At this state the MNE is metering according to a metering
      configuration received by a CONFIGURE message.


   All of these states have sub-states, but the basic M-NSLP operation
   per session is described on the level of these three states.

   A session is identified by SESSION_ID.  All sessions start in state
   'session closed'.  Transitions between states are caused by events:

   CONF:

      This transition is triggered by a CONFIGURE message that
      identifies the session and that is received and processed
      successfully by the MNE.

   REFR:

      This transition is triggered by a REFRESH message that identifies
      an existing session in state 'pending' or 'metering'.

   RESP-M:

      This transition is triggered by a RESPONSE message that is sent by
      the MNE in order to indicate that a metering configuration sent by
      a CONFIGURE message of the same session has become active at the
      MNE.  This transaction always leads to state 'metering'.

   RESP-N:

      This transition is triggered by a RESPONSE message that is sent by
      the MNE in order to indicate that a metering configuration sent by
      a CONFIGURE message of the same session has not become active at
      the MNE.  This transaction always leads to state 'session closed'.

   T-OUT:

      This transition is triggered by a time out of a session in state
      'pending' or 'metering'.  This transaction always leads to state
      'session closed'.

5.  Examples of Operation

   The basic signaling sequences are similar to QoS NSLP: To start a
   configuration, the MNI constructs a CONFIGURE message with the
   required MSPEC objects, and sends it to the MNR.  The message is
   interpreted by MNEs on the data path.  The MNR replies with a
   RESPONSE message.


       +---+  CONFIGURE  +---+  CONFIGURE  +---+  CONFIGURE  +---+
       |   |------------>|   |------------>|   |------------>|   |
       |MNI|             |MNF|             |MNF|             |MNR|
       |   |<------------|   |<------------|   |<------------|   |
       +---+   RESPONSE  +---+   RESPONSE  +---+   RESPONSE  +---+

   Similarly, a REFRESH message can be initiated by MNI, travels to the
   MNR where a RESPONSE is issued and sent back.


       +---+    REFRESH  +---+    REFRESH  +---+    REFRESH  +---+
       |   |------------>|   |------------>|   |------------>|   |
       |MNI|             |MNF|             |MNF|             |MNR|
       |   |<------------|   |<------------|   |<------------|   |
       +---+   RESPONSE  +---+   RESPONSE  +---+   RESPONSE  +---+

   More detailed examples of operation will be depicted in future
   versions of this document.

6.  Mapping onto M-NSLP Requirements

   With the design described above, the requirements from [I-D.fessi-
   nsis-m-nslp-framework] are at this point satisfied as follows:

   Extensibility:

      The actual configuration information is encapsulated in the MSPEC.
      The MSPEC is designed such as it is interpreted by the Metering
      Manager and can be opaque to the M-NSLP processing.  Furthermore,
      the MSPEC can be easily extended.  Therefore, from the point of
      view of the configuration information, this requirement is
      fulfilled.  Note however, that the Metering NSLP in its current
      design might show some lack of extensibility.  For example,
      considering the selection of the MNEs, it might be useful for
      future application of the Metering NSLP to have the option "ANY
      N", where N is greater than one.

   Interoperability:

      Again, whether different metering solutions can interwork depends
      on how the MSPEC is designed.  In QoS NSLP, the QSpec template
      design [I-D.ietf-nsis-qspec] aims at similar extensibility and
      interoperability.  It needs to be studied whether or not the
      solutions chosen by the QSpec can also be applied to the MSPEC.

   Flexible metering models:

      As above, this is an issue of MSPEC design.

   Distinguishing flows

      The aggregation feature detailed in this requirement can be
      realized as described in Section 3.3.7.

   Flexible data collection:

      Another issue that can be fixed in the MSPEC.

   Location of Metering Entities:

      MNEs, including MNI and MNR can be located anywhere on the data
      path.

Internet-Draft                Metering NSLP                    July 2005


   Access parameters of the Collector Information:

      Access parameters of the Collector Information on how to deliver
      flow records to the Collector is coded in the MSPEC.

   Configuration of Metering Entities:

      The protocol can configure Metering Entities that are MNEs, or
      that are controlled by MNEs.

   Selection of Metering Entities:

      As described in Section 3.3.5, a MNE should be able to decide to
      pull out of the metering process.  This is realized by the
      MNE_Selection object.

   Metering Configuration State installation and removal:

      By means of the CONFIGURE message, the protocol can install and
      remove Metering Configuration State.

   Initiation and maintenance of metering tasks:

      Triggers and correlation identifier are transported in the MSPEC.

   Reaction to Route Changes:

      The protocol detects route changes by a REFRESH or a refreshing
      CONFIGURE message and installs state along the new route, as
      described in Section 3.3.4.

   Scoping of configuration:

      The M-NSLP needs to provide sufficient means for flexible scoping
      signaling messages.

   Requirements not mentioned in this list are not yet addressed.

7.  Security considerations

   The process of configuring entities to start and stop metering and to
   transmit collected resource records to a third party introduces
   security challenges.
   o  First, the application domain (e.g., usage of the metering NSLP
      for configuration entities related to accounting and charging)
      needs to be considered.  For example, if a user is capable of stop
      metering of a requested services then fraud is possible.
      Furthermore, it must not be possible to configure metering



Dressler, et al.    draft-dressler-nsis-metering-nslp-02.txt    [Page 26]

Internet-Draft                Metering NSLP                    July 2005


      entities in such a way that other users are charged for the usage
      of a service, which they have not used.
   o  Second, interworking between multiple domains causes authorization
      problems.  For example, network domain A might want to collect
      resource records in network domain B to offer the user with a more
      consistent bill covering both the price of the network resource
      consumption and the application usage.  A high degree of trust is
      required to allow other domains to configure metering entities and
      to collect the resource usage of particular users.  In any case it
      needs to be prevented that arbitrary resource records associated
      with users are collected by other domains.  It has to be noted
      that the process of charging involves other states than only the
      collection of usage records.
   o  Third, it must be avoided that a denial of service attack is
      mounted on either Collectors or Monitoring Probes.  Monitoring
      Probes can be subject to DoS attacks if a large number of resource
      have to be collected or 'unlimited' per-flow states are created.
      Collectors can be subject to DoS attacks if they are flooded with
      metering records.

   The above considerations raise the main question whether the
   meetering NSLP can be used outside a single administrative domain.
   Ideally, it should have a broader applicability but security, privacy
   and other operational concerns might limit its applicability for
   multiple domain traversal (and also end-to-end signaling).

   In the broader sense the following aspects might require an answer:

   o  The introduced mechanisms allow a number of entities to configure
      metering entities.  This might introduce some weaknesses compared
      to a centralized approach where a single entity (or a few selected
      entities) are authorized to perform this action.  Authorizing the
      decentralized configuration of nodes is more difficult to secure.
      Any node can initiate signaling message.  Hence, a single
      malicious entity within the network is able to start/stop/modify
      the process of collecting metering records within a single domain
      or even beyond this domain.
   o  Why would one domain allow (or disallow) the configuration/
      reconfiguration of nodes triggered by another domain?
   o  Would a network operator allow an end user to collect information
      about flows within the network?
   o  Would it be reasonable to allow a user to collect information
      about a flow that he created but not for other flows?
   o  Is it reasonable to assume that nodes along the path are
      configured to send collected data to an arbitrary IP address?
   o  Would it be reasonable to place some restrictions on the entity
      that are supposed to receive this information (i.e., the
      Collector)?

Internet-Draft                Metering NSLP                    July 2005


   o  Is a check needed to ensure that the Collector actually wants to
      receive this information or even asked to collect it?.  Some
      denial of service attacks (via amplification) are possible if data
      can be sent to an arbitrary IP address.  The adversary needs to
      send a single metering NSLP message in order to flood a victim
      with potentially a huge amount of data over a certain period of
      time.
   o  Would a network operator want to reveal sensitive information?
      Some of the information might have a relevance for the operator's
      business?
   o  The collection of metering data about individual flows is a
      potentially privacy sensitive task.  Who owns, in legal terms, the
      collected data (e.g., the user who initiated the flow, the owner
      of the Monitoring Probe?  Does ownership imply other rights (e.g.,
      the right to dissemination)?  Is it necessary to consider privacy
      policies?  Is it necessary to constrain the distribution of the
      collected data in some way (e.g. based on user privacy policies)?
   o  Do certain terms and conditions, to which the metering site(s),
      and the user have to agree, apply?
   o  Is it necessary to protect the confidentiality of the metered
      data?  If so, against disclosure to whom?

   Answers to a few of these questions will help to develop an
   authorization/trust model.

8.  Open Issues
      The protocol in its current design allows to select, except the
      case "FIRST and LAST", either only one MNE or all the MNEs on the
      path for the metering process.  Based on the current scenarios
      elaborated in [I-D.fessi-nsis-m-nslp-framework], this is
      sufficient.  However, the option to have, for example, "ANY N",
      where N is greater than one, might be useful in future
      applications of the Metering NSLP.
      In some cases, the Collector needs to distinguish between the
      Metering Records received from the different MNEs in order to
      correlate them.  For example, if MNE_Selection is "FIRST and
      LAST", the Collector needs to know, which data come from the first
      and resp. the last MNE on the signaling path.  Also, in the case
      where MNE_Selection is "ALL", the Collector needs to know the
      position of the MNEs that are sending the Metering Records on the
      path in order to correlate them correctly, (for example to
      calculate the hop-by-hop delay).  This information needs to be
      transferred to the Collector in the Metering Records using an
      other protocol.  However, the M-NSLP might also need to provide
      mechanisms to coordinate this.  Each MNE need to know its position
      on the path, i.e. how many MNEs exists between it and the MNI.
      Moreover, if not all the IP hops on the path do support the
      Metering NSLP, it will be useful for the Collector to know how far

Internet-Draft                Metering NSLP                    July 2005


      each pair of adjacent MNEs are from each other.
      Based on the current analysis of the security issues of the
      Metering NSLP discussed in Section 7, an authentication and
      authorization scheme for the Metering NSLP needs to be elaborated.
      The policy objects carried in Metering NSLP messages need to be
      specified.

   Additional open issues appear in the main body of the text.
