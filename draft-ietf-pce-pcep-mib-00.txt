1  Introduction

    This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
    (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
    community. In particular, it defines a MIB module that can be
    used to manage Path Computation Element communication
    Protocol (PCEP) for communications between a Path Computation Client
    (PCC) and a Path Computation Element (PCE), or between two PCEs.

2  Terminology

   The terminology used in this document is built on notions introduced
   and discussed in PCE WG documents.  The reader should be familiar
   with these documents

   Domain:
      any collection of network elements within a common sphere of
      address management or path computational responsibility.

   IGP Area:
      OSPF Area or ISIS level.

   PCC:
      Path Computation Client: any client application requesting a path
      computation to be performed by a Path Computation Element.

   PCE:
      Path Computation Element: an entity (component, application, or
      network node) that is capable of computing a network path or route
      based on a network graph, and applying computational
      constraints.

   PCEP Client:
      A PCEP client represents a PCE or a PCC for network management 
      purposes.

3  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

    For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
    Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7
    of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

    Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
    termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are
    generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol
    (SNMP). Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms
    defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This
    memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which
    is described in STD 58,RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579
    [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

4.  PCEP MIB Module Architecture

   The PCEP MIB will contain the following information:
   a. PCEP client configuration and status.
   b. PCEP peer configuration and information.
   c. PCEP session configuration and information.
   d. Notifications to indicate PCEP session changes.


4.1. Relations to other MIB modules
        
     TBD

5  Example of the PCEP MIB module usage

-- Revision history

    REVISION 
      "200811031200Z"  -- Nov 03 2008 12:00:00 EST 
    DESCRIPTION 
        "Changes from -01- draft include support for the following
           in the MIB :
           o  The SyncTimer,
           o  The maximum number of sessions that can be setup,
           o  Request timer: amount of time a PCC waits for a reply 
              before resending its path computation requests 
              (potentially to an alternate PCE).
           o  The MAX-UNKNOWN-REQUESTS
           o  The MAX-UNKNOWN-MESSAGES
           o  Response time (minimum, average and maximum), on a 
              per PCE Peer basis,
           o  PCEP Session failures,
           o  Amount of time the session has been in active state,
           o  Number of corrupted messages,
           o  Number of failed computations,

        Changes from -00- draft :
         1. Clarified the notion of PCEP Client.
         2. Added new objects to the PCEP client and session tables
            to manage PCEP protocol as in section 8 of 
            draft-ietf-pce-pcep-08.txt
         3. Did not add all the objects to manage the recommendations
            in draft-ietf-pce-pcep-08.txt to control the complexity of
            the MIB."

7. Security Considerations

   These MIB modules can be used for configuration of certain objects,
   and anything that can be configured can be incorrectly configured,
   with potentially disastrous results.

   There are a number of management objects defined in these MIB modules
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments. The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations. These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:
   TBD

8. IANA Considerations

-- (Note to RFC-Editor:)
-- We request that you assign contiguous RFC numbers to the
--   IANA is requested to root MIB objects in the MIB module
--   contained in this document under the transmission subtree.
