  1.      Introduction 
      
     FIRS is intended to provide a distributed WHOIS-like information 
     service, using the LDAPv3 specifications [RFC3377] for the data-
     formatting and query-transport functions.

     More specifically, the principle objective behind FIRS is to offer 
     structured information about distributed Internet resources in a 
     model which reflects the federated delegations of those resources. 
     This specifically includes centralized delegations from authorized 
     governance bodies (such as DNS domains within the "com" zone), but 
     also includes delegations from authorized bodies further down the 
     delegation path (such as leaf-node DNS domain names within the 
     "example.com" zone). 
      
     Furthermore, the FIRS service is intended to be used with a wide 
     variety of resources. The core set of specifications define rules 
     for handling the most-common resources (DNS domains, IP addresses, 
     contact information, and so forth), but other types of resources 
     may be grafted onto the architecture as needed. By extension, FIRS 
     should be capable of providing the necessary support structure for 
     any kind of information to be stored in a global mesh of FIRS-
     centric LDAP directories, and for the FIRS-specific clients and 
     servers to be easily extended to accommodate that data. 
      
     Another critical objective can be described as predictability, in 
     that FIRS-specific data should be easily accessible to a wide 
     number of applications. For example, if a network manager wants to 
     retrieve information about a particular host or network, it should 
     be easy for the management application to be extended so that the 
     FIRS data can be fetched by that application, rather than always 
     requiring the use of a FIRS-specific application. 
      
     Finally, the collection of specifications which define the 
     Federated Internet Registry Service (FIRS) are intended to satisfy 
     the CRISP Working Group requirements, as specified in draft-ietf-
     crisp-requirements-05, "Cross Registry Internet Service Protocol 
     (CRISP) Requirements" [CRISP-REQ]. 
      
     In order to achieve these objectives, the FIRS specifications 
     collectively define an LDAP-specific application, including 
     application-specific namespaces, object classes, attributes, 
     syntaxes, queries, behavioral rules, and more. 
      
  1.1.    Background 
      
     The original WHOIS service [RFC812] was provided as a front-end to 
     a centralized repository of ARPANET resources and users. Over 
     time, hundreds of WHOIS servers have been deployed across the 
     public Internet, with each server providing general information 
     about the particular network resources under the control of a 
     specific organization. 
   
  Hall                  I-D Expires: December 2003             [page 3] 
  Internet Draft    draft-ietf-crisp-firs-arch-01.txt         May 2003 
   
   
      
     Unfortunately, neither [RFC812] nor any of its successors define a 
     strict set of data-typing or formatting requirements, and as a 
     result, each of the different implementations provide different 
     kinds of information in slightly different ways. Furthermore, each 
     WHOIS server operates as a self-contained entity, with no 
     standardized mechanisms to infer knowledge of any other servers, 
     meaning that WHOIS servers cannot redirect clients to other 
     servers for additional information. Another concern is that the 
     WHOIS services which are being operated today offer no means of 
     client authentication, requiring that server operators essentially 
     publish all data with a single "world-readable" permission. 
     However, this single permission conflicts with the privacy and 
     security policies of specific jurisdictions. 
      
     There are many other secondary issues with the WHOIS service as it 
     exists in current form. However, the largest problems are a lack 
     of standardized data formats, a lack of widely-supported referral 
     mechanisms, and a lack of privacy and security controls, as 
     described in the preceding text. 
      
     FIRS attempts to address these issues by defining guidelines for 
     the operation of a distributed and highly-structured WHOIS-like 
     service, using LDAPv3 for the query/response transfer service, and 
     using LDAP schema for the search inputs, answer data, and 
     redirection mechanisms. In short, the intention of this approach 
     is to provide an extensible and scalable WHOIS-like service, by 
     leveraging the inherent capabilities of LDAPv3. 
      
  1.2.    Overview 
      
     The FIRS collection of specifications cumulatively define a 
     structured and distributed information service, including an 
     extensible framework and resource-specific definitions. The 
     framework defined in this document is intended to accommodate a 
     variety of different resource-types and usages, while the other 
     specifications define the technical details for the service as a 
     whole or for the different resource-types. 
      
     Cumulatively, the FIRS collection of specifications define the 
     following service elements: 
      
        *   Namespace Rules. The FIRS specifications define a layered 
            namespace consisting of DNS-based delegation hierarchies, a 
            FIRS-specific container entry, and resource-specific 
            subordinate entries.

  Internet Draft    draft-ietf-crisp-firs-arch-01.txt         May 2003 
   
   
      
        *   Schema Definitions. The FIRS specifications reuse some 
            existing LDAP schema definitions, and also define several 
            FIRS-specific definitions, as needed. 
      
        *   Query-Processing Rules. The FIRS specifications also reuse 
            some existing processing rules, and define several 
            additional rules as needed. Among these rules are 
            requirements for normalizing data, locating servers, 
            processing referrals, and more. 
      
     Some of these rules apply to the architecture as a whole, while 
     other rules apply to specific kinds of Internet resources. 
      
  2.      Prerequisites and Terminology 
      
     The complete set of specifications in the FIRS collection 
     cumulative define a structured and distributed information service 
     using LDAPv3 for the data-formatting and transport functions. This 
     specification should be read in the context of the complete set of 
     specifications, which currently include the following:

     As can be seen in Figure 1, entries use a FIRS-specific namespace 
     in conjunction with FIRS-specific schema. Meanwhile, clients use 
     FIRS-specific queries to locate and retrieve this information.

  4.      The FIRS Namespace 
      
     A critical aspect of FIRS is the use of an application-specific 
     namespace which is imposed on all FIRS-based resources. 
      
     The FIRS namespace rules facilitate the programmatic creation of 
     searches, and help to ensure predictable results. The use of a 
     private namespace also acts to segregate FIRS-related data from 
     other kinds of data which may reside on a participating server, 
     thereby giving the operator greater control over the security and 
     replication considerations for all of the data. 
      
     The FIRS namespace consists of three "layers", which are: 
      
        *   A set of domainComponent relative distinguished names which 
            cumulatively identify a specific partition of the global 
            directory tree. 
      
        *   A FIRS-specific entry which acts as a container for all of 
            the FIRS-related resource-specific child entries. 
      
        *   The resource-specific entries which describe the resources 
            under the control of the selected partition. 
      
     The namespace follows a right-to-left order. 
      
     As an example, Figure 1 shows a DNS domain resource entry named 
     "cn=example.com,cn=inetResources,dc=example,dc=com", which refers 
     to the "example.com" domain resource within the "cn=inetResources" 
     container under the "dc=example,dc=com" directory partition. 
      
  4.1.    The domainComponent Hierarchy 
      
     The top-level of the namespace uses the domainComponent naming and 
     mapping rules specified in RFC 2247 [RFC2247], which maps DNS 
     domain names to domainComponent ("dc=") relative distinguished 
     names (RDNs). The full sequence of domainComponent RDNs map to an 
     equivalent scope of authority in the DNS namespace, with the full 
     sequence of RDNs cumulatively representing the root of a partition 
     in the LDAP directory tree. 
      
     In this model, a sequence of domainComponent RDNs map to a domain 
     name in the global DNS hierarchy, with the FIRS partitions 
     providing scopes of authority in the global FIRS database of 
     distributed partitions. Furthermore, the SRV resource records 
     associated with those DNS domains also provide a useful mechanism 
   
  Hall                  I-D Expires: December 2003             [page 8] 
  Internet Draft    draft-ietf-crisp-firs-arch-01.txt         May 2003 
   
   
     for locating the authoritative LDAP servers associated with any 
     particular resource in the global FIRS directory database. 
      
     Since the partition roots determine the scope of control over a 
     set of resources, partitions which overlap also have overlapping 
     scopes of control. For example, the "dc=com" and 
     "dc=example,dc=com" partitions can both provide information about 
     the "www.example.com" domain name resource. In order to reduce the 
     amount of ambiguity which is naturally present in this kind of 
     model, FIRS defines multiple bootstrapping models and also defines 
     the default model which should be used for any given resource. For 
     example, queries for centrally-delegated resources are supposed to 
     ask the top-level partition for information about those resources, 
     while queries for user-managed resources are supposed to ask the 
     leaf-node partition for information about those resources. 
      
     For example, Figure 1 shows the directory partition of 
     "dc=example,dc=com" which maps to the "example.com" scope of 
     authority from the DNS hierarchy, with the "dc=example,dc=com" 
     sequence representing the root of a partition in the globally 
     distributed directory database. 
      
  4.2.    The inetResources Container 
      
     This specification requires the use of a mandatory LDAP container 
     entry with the RDN of "cn=inetResources", which MUST exist at the 
     root of every directory partition that provides FIRS services. All 
     publically-accessible resource-specific entries MUST be stored in 
     the "cn=inetResources" container entry. 
      
     The primary motivation for this naming rule is for predictability, 
     in that it allows searches to be formed programmatically (a search 
     base for resources in "dc=example,dc=com" can be programmatically 
     formed as "cn=inetResources,dc=example,dc=com", for example). 
     Furthermore, the use of a single container entry for all of an 
     organization's FIRS-related resources allows that branch of the 
     directory database to be managed independently of other entries on 
     the server, which facilitates better operational security and 
     replication controls. 
      
     All told, the use of the inetResources container is important 
     enough to justify the MANDATORY usage of this naming syntax.

  4.3.    Resource-Specific Entries 
      
     The FIRS collection of specifications define several Internet 
     resource types, each of which have their own naming rules. 
     However, each resource type follows a consistent naming principle, 
     in that each specific resource has an RDN which uniquely 
     identifies that resource within the inetResources container entry. 
      
     For example, Figure 1 shows an entry for the "www.example.com" 
     domain name resource in the "cn=inetResources" container of the 
     "dc=example,dc=com" partition, and also shows an entry for the 
     "admins@example.com" contact resource in that same container and 
     partition. Although the naming syntax is different for each 
     resource type, the naming rules are consistent and facilitate 
     predictable usage. 
      
     The naming rules for each of the distinct resource type are 
     provided in the documents which govern those resource types. 
      
  4.4.    Namespace Aliases 
      
     FIRS allows entries to alias for other entries through the use of 
     referrals. In this model, an entry exists which will match against 
     searches for the queried data, but the attributes associated with 
     that entry indicate that some other entry should also be queried. 
      
     Referrals represent one of the strongest capabilities of the FIRS 
     architecture, in that they allow for a significant variety of 
     cross-referencing among entries. For example, referrals can be 
     used to point an inetResources container entry in one partition to 
     another inetResources container entry in another partition, 
     allowing multiple partitions to effectively share a single 
     partition (this is useful when organizations manage multiple 
     networks or domains, and wish to consolidate their management). As 
     another example, referrals can also be used to create placeholder 
     entries for specific resources (such as a web server) which only 
     exist as referrals for resources which are managed in other 
     partitions (such as a web-hosting server at an ISP), with both 
     entries providing information about that resource. 
      
     This latter example can be seen in Figure 1, which shows an entry 
     for "cn=www.example.com,cn=inetResources,dc=example,dc=com" which 
     provides a referral to the "cn=host.example.net" entry at 
     "cn=inetResources,dc=example,dc=net". Queries for the local entry 
     would be answered with the locally-available information and then 
   
  Hall                  I-D Expires: December 2003            [page 10] 
  Internet Draft    draft-ietf-crisp-firs-arch-01.txt         May 2003 
   
   
     redirected to the referral target where additional information 
     could be retrieved. 
      
     FIRS supports two different kinds of referrals, which are 
     subordinate reference referrals and continuation reference 
     referrals. Subordinate reference referrals indicate that the 
     search base used in the query only exists as an alias to another 
     partition or entry, meaning that the entire query must be 
     restarted in order for any answer data to be retrieved. Meanwhile, 
     continuation reference referrals indicate that some answer data is 
     available, but that more information is available at some other 
     location, and that the client should start new queries in order to 
     retrieve all of the information. 
      
     Referrals are provided as URLs. FIRS specifically requires the use 
     of LDAP URLs in order to ensure predictable automated processing. 
     Refer to section 6.4.1 for a brief discussion on how these URLs 
     are processed by FIRS clients. 
      
  4.5.    Partition Replicas 
      
     All directory partitions which provide data for global Internet 
     resources SHOULD be replicated across two or more servers. Each of 
     the authoritative LDAP servers for the managed resource MUST be 
     specified with a unique DNS SRV resource record for the domain 
     name associated with the top-level resource assignment space. 
      
     Directory partitions which serve multiple organizations SHOULD 
     also be replicated. For example, an ISP which provides FIRS 
     services for their customers SHOULD also follow these same rules, 
     since outages of those servers will affect multiple parties. Leaf-
     node directory partitions associated with an user-managed resource 
     MAY be replicated, and are encouraged to do so. 
      
     Similarly, any referral URLs which include host identifier 
     elements SHOULD provide multiple URLs, each of which identify 
     different hosts. For leaf-node referrals and labeledURI 
     references, this behavior MAY be relaxed, although it is still 
     encouraged. 
      
     Note that the most effective replication strategy will be for 
     entities to replicate their directory partitions with the 
     delegation parents, as this will allow queries for those resources 
     to be processed by the parent servers (thereby eliminating the 
     need for referral queries). In many cases, this will not be 
     feasible (the servers for the "dc=com" directory partition cannot 
   
  Hall                  I-D Expires: December 2003            [page 11] 
  Internet Draft    draft-ietf-crisp-firs-arch-01.txt         May 2003 
   
   
     be expected to host replicas of every subordinate directory 
     partition), but it is encouraged where practical. 
      
     It is also expected that certain servers will be configured to 
     serve as multi-replica masters, effectively acting as large-scale 
     caching servers for many different resources. When used in 
     conjunction with the targeted bootstrap model described in section 
     6.4.1, this will allow clients to retrieve a significant amount of 
     information without having to pursue a large number of referrals 
     or redirects. This usage is expected and endorsed. 
      
     Finally, it is important to recognize that the LDAP specifications 
     do not currently provide cache timers or any other mechanisms 
     which can indicate how accurate or timely any replicas may be. 
      
  5.      FIRS Schema Definitions 
      
     Another critical aspect of FIRS is the use of well-known schema, 
     including object classes, attributes, syntaxes and matching 
     filters. Some of the schema definitions are for the global FIRS 
     service and are usable by all entries (including resource-specific 
     entries), while others are specific to particular resource-types. 
      
     Wherever any suitable pre-existing schema definitions are 
     available they should be reused, since reuse facilitates 
     integration with other LDAP applications. 
      
  5.1.    Global Schema 
      
     There are three global schema definitions which can be used by any 
     of the entries within FIRS. These include: 
      
        *   The "inetResources" master schema. All FIRS-related entries 
            (including the inetResources container entry and all of the 
            resource-specific subordinate entries) MUST use the 
            inetResources structural object class and schema 
            definitions defined in [FIRS-CORE]. The inetResources 
            object class defines a variety of general-purpose 
            attributes which are useful for general information about 
            an organization and its resources. 
      
        *   Associated resources. All FIRS-related entries MAY use the 
            "inetAssociatedResources" auxiliary object class and schema 
            definitions defined in [FIRS-CORE]. This object class 
            provides cross-reference pointer attributes which allow an 
   
  Hall                  I-D Expires: December 2003            [page 12] 
  Internet Draft    draft-ietf-crisp-firs-arch-01.txt         May 2003 
   
   
            entry to reference other resources which may be of interest 
            to the user. 
      
        *   Referral pointers. All FIRS-related entries MAY use the 
            "referral" object class and schema definitions defined in 
            [RFC3296]. This object class allows an entry to exist as a 
            referral source, with queries for that resource being 
            redirected to the referral target. Refer to section 4.4 for 
            a discussion on the different kinds of referral mechanisms 
            offered by FIRS, and section 6.4.1 for a discussion on the 
            FIRS referral-processing mechanisms. 
      
     Figure 1 shows that all of the entries within and including the 
     "cn=inetResources" container entry have the inetResources object 
     class defined. Meanwhile, each of the resource-specific entries in 
     that example also have their own resource-specific object classes, 
     while the "cn=www.example.com" resource-specific entry also has 
     the referral object class defined. 
      
  5.1.1.  The inetResources schema 
      
     The inetResources object class is intended to provide summary 
     information about a collection of resources under the control of a 
     single organization or management body. Since this object class is 
     also inherited by the resource-specific object classes, these 
     attributes can be defined at each of the subordinate entries if a 
     global set of attribute values is undesirable or unfeasible. 
      
     Since multiple directory partitions can use subordinate reference 
     referrals to share a single common inetResources entry, it is 
     important for the data to be applicable to all of the entries 
     which refer to it. For example, it would be effective for a small 
     private company to use a shared set of inetResources attributes 
     for their DNS domain names and IP network blocks, but it would 
     probably be counter-productive for a global ISP to share contact 
     data across all of their hosted domains and routed networks. If 
     separate contacts are required for each resource, the contact data 
     should be specified within each entry, rather than being linked to 
     the inetResources entry. 
      
     The inetResources object class provides several multi-valued 
     contact-related attributes for a variety of well-known 
     administrative roles. This model allows the inetResources entry 
     and each of the subordinate managed resources to share a common 
     set of administrative roles, or to have unique roles for each 
     resource, as seen fit by the managing entity.

  Internet Draft    draft-ietf-crisp-firs-arch-01.txt         May 2003 
   
   
      
  5.1.2.  The inetAssociatedResources schema 
      
     The inetAssociatedResources object class defines attributes which 
     are useful for providing general-purpose cross-referencing 
     information with other resources. For example, a contact entry can 
     list IPv4 networks or DNS domains as associated resources, thereby 
     providing a simplistic cross-reference mechanism between an 
     administrator and the resource he manages. In short, any resource 
     can be associated with any other resource through the use of this 
     object class. 
      
  5.1.3.  The referral schema 
      
     The referral object class is used to redirect queries to other 
     entries programmatically. This object class and its associated 
     schema and rules provide the backbone of the aliasing mechanisms 
     discussed in section 4.4. 
      
  5.2.    Resource-Specific Schema 
      
     In addition to the global schema definitions, each of the 
     resource-specific entries in FIRS MUST use the resource-specific 
     schema definitions defined for use with that specific resource 
     type. These object classes are defined in the specifications which 
     govern the different resource-types. These include: 
      
        *   DNS domains. Every domain name resource entry MUST use the 
            inetDnsDomain object class and schema definitions defined 
            in [FIRS-DNS]. These entries can refer to zone delegations, 
            host-specific entries, reverse-lookup pointer entries, or 
            any other domain name. 
      
        *   DNS resource-records. Any domain name resource MAY use the 
            inetDnsRR object class and schema definitions defined in 
            [FIRS-DNSRR]. The inetDnsRR object class defines a single 
            optional attribute for storing multiple DNS resource 
            records as supplemental data to a domain name entry. 
      
        *   IPv4 address blocks. Every IPv4 address block resource MUST 
            use the inetIpv4Network object class and schema definitions 
            defined in [FIRS-IPV4]. Entries can refer to entire 
            networks or to single hosts, as needed. 
      
        *   IPv6 address blocks. Every IPv6 address block resource MUST 
            use the inetIpv6Network object class and schema definitions 
   
  Hall                  I-D Expires: December 2003            [page 14] 
  Internet Draft    draft-ietf-crisp-firs-arch-01.txt         May 2003 
   
   
            defined in [FIRS-IPV6]. Entries can refer to entire 
            networks or to single hosts, as needed. 
      
        *   Autonomous system numbers. Every autonomous system number 
            resource MUST use the inetAsNumber object class and schema 
            definitions defined in [FIRS-ASN]. 
      
        *   Contacts. Every contact entry MUST use the inetOrgPerson 
            object class defined in [RFC2798], but MUST also use the 
            additional schema definitions defined in [FIRS-CONTCT]. 
      
     As was discussed in section 5.1, each resource-specific entry MAY 
     exist as a referral source, or MAY have attributes which refer to 
     additional (related) resources. 
      
  6.      Query Processing Behaviors 
      
     Another critical aspect to FIRS is the query-processing behavioral 
     rules which govern the ways in which a client parses an input 
     string, locates a server which is authoritative for the resource 
     being queried, generates LDAPv3 queries, and processes the 
     resulting answer data. More specifically: 
      
        *   Query pre-processing. Portions of this process require the 
            client to determine the type of resource being queried for, 
            and to determine the initial partition which should be used 
            for the query. Since this process is different for each 
            particular resource-type, the rules which govern this 
            behavior are defined in each of the resource-specific 
            specifications. 
      
        *   Bootstrap processing. Once a resource-type and partition 
            have been determined, the client must locate the LDAP 
            servers which are authoritative for that partition. [FIRS-
            CORE] defines three different bootstrap models that clients 
            can use as part of this process, while each of the 
            resource-specific specifications define which of the models 
            are to be used for each particular resource-type. 
      
        *   Query processing. Once a server has been located, the 
            client must submit the LDAP query which was formed during 
            the pre-preprocessing phase. [FIRS-CORE] defines certain 
            LDAPv3 query parameters which all FIRS clients MUST conform 
            with, while the resource-specific specifications define 
            resource-specific matching rules. 
      
   
  Hall                  I-D Expires: December 2003            [page 15] 
  Internet Draft    draft-ietf-crisp-firs-arch-01.txt         May 2003 
   
   
        *   Query post-processing. Response data frequently needs to be 
            further processed. For example, referrals may need to be 
            processed, or some kinds of data may need to be localized. 
            These mechanisms and their behavioral rules are defined in 
            [FIRS-CORE], while the resource-specific specifications may 
            also describe supplemental rules. 
      
     Each of these phases are discussed in more detail below. 
      
  6.1.    Query Pre-Processing 
      
     Client input is generally limited to a single well-formed unit of 
     data, such as a domain name ("example.com") or an email address 
     ("admins@example.com"), and this single piece of information must 
     be used to subsequently build a fully-formed LDAPv3 query, 
     including the assertion value, the search base, the matching 
     filter, and so forth. All of these steps are part of the pre-
     processing phase. 
      
     Although the exact sequence of steps will vary according to the 
     resource-type being queried, there are some commonalities between 
     each of them. Among these steps: 
      
        *   Determine the resource type. Different kinds of resources 
            have different processing steps, validation mechanisms, and 
            so forth, each of which require that the resource-type be 
            appropriately identified. Clients MAY use any mechanisms 
            necessary to force this determination. 
      
        *   Validate and normalize the data. In all cases, the input 
            data MUST be validated and normalized according to the 
            syntax rules defined in the specification which governs the 
            resource-type. As an example of this step, queries for 
            internationalized domain names must be validated and 
            normalized into a canonical UTF-8 [RFC2279] form before any 
            other steps can be taken. Similarly, IPv6 addresses are 
            required to conform to specific syntax rules, and input 
            address may need to be expanded or compressed in order to 
            comply with the syntax requirements. 
      
        *   Determine the authoritative directory partition for the 
            named resource. In most cases, the authoritative partition 
            will be a variation of the input query string, but this is 
            not always the case. For example, the default partition for 
            an email address will be extrapolated from the domain 
            component of the email address itself, while the 
   
  Hall                  I-D Expires: December 2003            [page 16] 
  Internet Draft    draft-ietf-crisp-firs-arch-01.txt         May 2003 
   
   
            authoritative partition for an ASN uses a reserved 
            (special-purpose) domain name. In some cases, the 
            authoritative partition may change during the subsequent 
            query-processing steps. 
      
        *   Determine the search base for the query. Each resource type 
            has resource-specific query-processing rules which will 
            dictate how the authoritative partitions are mapped to the 
            search base. In some cases, the cn=inetResources container 
            entry in the authoritative partition will be used "as-is", 
            while in other cases, the cn=inetResources container entry 
            in a delegation parent of the authoritative partition will 
            be used instead. In some cases, the search base may change 
            during subsequent query-processing steps. 
      
        *   Determine the assertion value for the query. The assertion 
            value will usually be the normalized form of the input 
            query. In some cases, the assertion value may change during 
            subsequent query-processing steps. 
      
        *   Determine the matching filter. Each resource-type has its 
            own matching filter rules. For example, contact entries are 
            matched with a simple equalityMatch comparison, while in 
            other cases the matching filter will be an extensibleMatch 
            which is peculiar to the resource-type in use. 
      
     Once all of the pre-processing steps have been successfully 
     completed, the client will have to locate an LDAPv3 server which 
     is authoritative for the search base before it can submit the 
     query. This process is described in section 6.2 below. 
      
  6.2.    Bootstrap Processing 
      
     The bootstrap process uses DNS queries to locate the LDAP servers 
     which should be used for a query. However, since different kinds 
     of resources are managed through different delegation models, 
     there are also different bootstrap models which have to be used to 
     perform this process. 
      
     FIRS supports three different bootstrap models, which are: 
      
        *   Targeted. The "targeted" bootstrap model has the client 
            attempting to locate the LDAP servers associated with a 
            specific domain name, such as a domain name which may be 
            returned as referrals or URLs. If no servers can be found, 
            the client exits the query. 
   
  Hall                  I-D Expires: December 2003            [page 17] 
  Internet Draft    draft-ietf-crisp-firs-arch-01.txt         May 2003 
   
   
      
        *   Top-down. The "top-down" bootstrap model has the client 
            attempting to locate the LDAP servers associated with a 
            top-level partition in the delegation path to the 
            authoritative partition. If no servers can be found for the 
            top-level domain, the client exits the query. 
      
        *   Bottom-up. The "bottom-up" bootstrap model has the client 
            attempting to locate the LDAP servers associated with the 
            authoritative partition itself. If no servers can be found 
            for that partition, the authoritative partition is reset to 
            the immediate parent in the delegation hierarchy and new 
            DNS queries are issued, with this process repeating until 
            some servers are found or there are no more partitions in 
            the delegation path which can be queried. 
      
     Each of the models are appropriate to different usages. For 
     example, The targeted model is most useful when a particular piece 
     of data is presumed to exist at a pre-determined location. 
     Meanwhile, the top-down model is best suited for searches about 
     global resources which are centrally managed and delegated (such 
     as IP addresses and DNS domains), and where centrally-managed 
     delegation information is critical. Finally, the bottom-up model 
     is most appropriate for resources which are not centrally 
     delegated and managed (such as contact information). 
      
  6.3.    Query Processing 
      
     Once an LDAP server has been located, the LDAPv3 query is 
     submitted to that server. 
      
     Most of the values for the query will have been collected during 
     the pre-processing phase, although [FIRS-CORE] defines some rules 
     which govern all queries. For example, [FIRS-CORE] specifies a 
     maximum time limit of 60 seconds for all queries in order to 
     prevent runaway searches which match all entries. 
      
     [FIRS-CORE] also allows for authentication and access controls, in 
     that FIRS servers are allowed to limit the depth and breadth of 
     information that they provide to a specific client based on a 
     variety of factors, including the level of authenticated access. 
      
     Another consideration which can arise during this phase of the 
     process is protocol and schema versioning considerations. These 
     mechanisms are already existent in the LDAPv3 specifications, and 
     their usage is encouraged by [FIRS-CORE].

  6.4.    Query Post-Processing 
      
     Once a query has been submitted and processed, the server should 
     return answer data or some kind of referral, or possibly both. In 
     general, FIRS clients are expected to display all of the answer 
     data and process all of the referrals, although there are specific 
     considerations which must be taken into account. In particular, 
     there are considerations for handling the different kinds of 
     referrals, and there are localizations issues for specific kinds 
     of attribute data. 
      
  6.4.1.  Referrals 
      
     As was discussed in section 4.4, there are two kinds of referral 
     mechanisms which are used with FIRS, which are subordinate 
     reference referrals and continuation reference referrals. More 
     specifically: 
      
        *   Subordinate reference referrals. Subordinate reference 
            referrals are returned when the search base specified in a 
            query exists as a referral to some other entry. This 
            condition means that the current search operation cannot 
            proceed, and that the search MUST be restarted using the 
            search base specified in the referral message. 
      
            Any of the FIRS-specific entries MAY be defined as 
            subordinate reference referrals, although they are 
            typically only used when the inetResources container entry 
            in a partition is an alias for an inetResources container 
            entry in another partition. Subordinate reference referrals 
            and their schema are defined in [RFC3296] although there 
            are additional restrictions placed on their usage as 
            described in [FIRS-CORE]. 
      
        *   Continuation reference referrals. Continuation reference 
            referrals are returned when a search operation has been 
            successfully processed by the queried server, but the 
            answer data also includes referrals to other entries. This 
            condition means that the current search operation has 
            succeeded, but that additional searches SHOULD be started 
            for all of the known answer data to be retrieved. 
      
            These referrals are often provided as supplemental data to 
            an answer set, although this is not required (a 
            continuation reference referral can be the only response, 
   
  Hall                  I-D Expires: December 2003            [page 19] 
  Internet Draft    draft-ietf-crisp-firs-arch-01.txt         May 2003 
   
   
            but it won't be the only response in the common case). 
            Continuation reference referrals and their schema are also 
            defined in [RFC3296], with additional restrictions placed 
            on their usage as described in [FIRS-CORE]. 
      
     Whenever a referral is received in response to a query, the client 
     is required to display any answer data which has also been 
     received and then process the referral. 
      
     LDAP referrals can use any kind of URL, although FIRS specifically 
     requires the use of LDAP URLs. The client is required to parse the 
     resulting URL for a host identifier, port number, search base, and 
     assertion value elements, and then use these elements to construct 
     and issue new queries. 
      
     Note that [RFC2251] defines a superior reference referral which is 
     used as a "default referral" for out-of-scope searches. However, 
     FIRS specifically excludes support for superior reference 
     referrals. Any superior reference referrals which are encountered 
     as part of this service are to be treated as errors. 
      
  6.4.2.  Internationalization and localization 
      
     The FIRS model uses the internationalization and localization 
     services which are inherent in LDAPv3. In many cases, this native 
     support is sufficient to accommodate internationalization and 
     localization considerations. However, there are several cases 
     where additional and explicit support is required. 
      
     For example, the domainComponent attribute is specifically 
     restricted to seven-bit character codes, and is traditionally 
     interpreted as simple [US-ASCII]. This is problematic with 
     internationalized domain names and the domainComponent attributes 
     derived from them, since these attribute sequences are used in 
     partition identifiers, search bases, and numerous other areas. In 
     order to ensure interoperability, all DNS domain names which are 
     mapped to domainComponent attributes MUST be reduced to their 
     ASCII-compatible form using the ToASCII process defined in 
     [RFC3490] before they are used for domainComponent sequences. 
      
     Similarly, although DNS is technically capable of storing eight-
     bit code-point values, the operational rules which govern DNS do 
     not support this usage for domain names which are used as host 
     identifiers (and this includes zone delegations). As a result, 
     internationalized domain names which are to be used for SRV or A 
     resource record lookups MUST be reduced to their ASCII-compatible 
   
  Hall                  I-D Expires: December 2003            [page 20] 
  Internet Draft    draft-ietf-crisp-firs-arch-01.txt         May 2003 
   
   
     form using the ToASCII process defined in [RFC3490] before these 
     DNS queries are issued. 
      
     In those cases where entries or attributes use normalized UTF-8 
     sequences inside of FIRS (specifically domain names and email 
     addresses), FIRS clients SHOULD offer ASCII-compatible versions of 
     those sequences, using the ToASCII process defined in [RFC3490]. 
     This will ensure that clients are able to use these sequences with 
     legacy (pre-IDNA) applications directly. For example, if an entry 
     displays an inetAssociatedDomains attribute, the domain names in 
     that attribute should be displayed in their default UTF-8 form 
     (assuming that the client's operating system and application 
     allows it), but should also be made available in their ASCII-
     compatible form (either as a clipboard option, command-line 
     option, or some other user-selectable switch) in order to allow 
     the data to be passed to a legacy application in a form which is 
     understandable by that application. 
      
     Attribute names are fixed, and can therefore be localized easily. 
     As such, clients MAY choose to convert attribute names into a 
     language appropriate to the local user for display purposes if 
     this is desirable. However, clients MUST NOT localize attribute 
     names which are used for query input. For example, clients MUST 
     NOT convert "cn=" or "dc=" relative distinguished labels into a 
     language-specific mapping and then use the mapped versions of 
     these labels for assertion values in a subsequent query. 
      
     RFC 2277 [RFC2277] requires free-text data to be tagged with 
     language tags. RFC 2596 [RFC2596] defines a mechanism for storing 
     language tags and language-specific attribute values, and these 
     mechanisms SHOULD be supported by FIRS clients and servers. For 
     example, an organization name could be provided in English and 
     Arabic, with the language tags allowing the client to display the 
     appropriate attribute value instance based on the locale settings 
     of the user. 
      
     International postal regulations generally require that the 
     recipient address on an envelope be provided in a language and 
     charset which is native to the recipient's country, with the 
     exception of the destination country name which should be provided 
     in a language and charset that is native to the sender's country. 
     This model ensures that the sender's post office will be able to 
     route the mail to the recipient's country, while also ensuring 
     that the destination country's post office will be able to perform 
     local delivery. In order to facilitate this usage, the country 
     attribute value MAY (encouraged) be localized to the local user's 
   
  Hall                  I-D Expires: December 2003            [page 21] 
  Internet Draft    draft-ietf-crisp-firs-arch-01.txt         May 2003 
   
   
     nomenclature for a country, but other postal address information 
     SHOULD NOT be localized. 
      
     Notwithstanding the above, it is ENCOURAGED that contact names be 
     provided in English forms in order to facilitate inter-party 
     communications, using the mechanisms offered by [RFC2596]. For 
     example, the default contact entry for a person in Japan SHOULD be 
     provided in the native form for that person, but an English form 
     is also ENCOURAGED in order to allow non-Japanese users to 
     properly address that person in subsequent communications. As 
     stated in the preceding paragraph however, any postal 
     communications for that person SHOULD use the native-language 
     representation (at least on the envelope) in order to facilitate 
     the delivery of postal mail. 
      
     Time and date strings in LDAP use the generalizedTime syntax, 
     making them predictable and easily convertible if necessary. As 
     such, dates MAY be localized for display purposes by client 
     applications as necessary. 
      
     Finally, clients must recognize that some URL data is likely to be 
     escaped, using at least one of the multiple rules which affect 
     URLs and resource-specific data. For example, a URL which contains 
     a domain name resource could theoretically have been escaped with 
     three or four different syntax rules, and clients MUST be prepared 
     to decode these URLs appropriately. 
      
  7.      Transition Issues 
      
     There are a handful of areas where FIRS does not fully compare 
     with all of the existing WHOIS service offerings. These areas are 
     discussed in more detail below. 
      
  7.1.    NIC Handles 
      
     Legacy NIC handles in existing databases can be accommodated using 
     two possible mechanisms: 
      
        *   NIC handle output in legacy WHOIS systems may be replaced 
            with email addresses for the contacts. This option 
            facilitates faster coalescence around the FIRS system. 
      
        *   NIC handles can be converted into locally-scoped email 
            addresses. For example, the NIC handle of EH26 on Network 
            Solutions' WHOIS server could be replaced with the locally-
   
  Hall                  I-D Expires: December 2003            [page 22] 
  Internet Draft    draft-ietf-crisp-firs-arch-01.txt         May 2003 
   
   
            scoped email address of "ehall@whois.netsol.com" or some 
            variation thereof. 
      
     Of the two mechanisms described above, the former is preferred. 
      
  7.2.    Change-Logs 
      
     Several WHOIS services provide pseudo change-logs in their 
     response data, listing each unique modification event which has 
     occurred for a particular resource. For example, RIPE and some of 
     its member ccTLDs provide WHOIS output which includes a series of 
     "changed" fields that itemize every modification event ("updated", 
     "added", etc.), the modifier, and the modification date, which 
     cumulatively act as a change-log for the resource in question. 
      
     Organizations are certainly free to maintain this information on 
     their internal systems (and are even encouraged to do so). 
     However, this information is not necessary for public view of the 
     data in the FIRS service. Where the auditing information will be 
     required, a format which is more suitable to legal review will 
     also be required. 
      
     Organizations who wish to make change-log information available to 
     the public should use an LDAP schema for this purpose. An initial 
     schema has been developed for this purpose and is available at 
     http://www.ehsco.com/misc/draft-hall-ldap-audit-00.txt. However, 
     this schema has not yet been proposed as a standards-track effort, 
     and should only be used as a starting point for other development. 
      
  8.      Security Considerations 
      
     The FIRS collection of specifications describe an application of 
     the LDAPv3 protocol, and as such it inherits the security 
     considerations associated with LDAPv3, as described in section 7 
     of [RFC2251]. 
      
     By nature, LDAP is a read-write protocol, while the legacy WHOIS 
     service has always been a read-only service. As such, there are 
     significant risks associated with allowing unintended updates by 
     unauthorized third-parties. Moreover, allowing the FIRS service to 
     update the underlying delegation databases could result in network 
     resources being stolen from their lawful operators. For example, 
     if the LDAP front-end had update access to a domain delegation 
     database, a malicious third-party could theoretically take 
     ownership of that domain by exploiting an authentication weakness, 
     thereby causing ownership of the domain to be changed to another 
   
  Hall                  I-D Expires: December 2003            [page 23] 
  Internet Draft    draft-ietf-crisp-firs-arch-01.txt         May 2003 
   
   
     party. For this reason, it is imperative that the FIRS service not 
     be allowed to make critical modifications to delegated resources 
     without ensuring that all possible precautions have been taken. 
      
     The query processing models described in this document make use of 
     DNS lookups in order to locate the LDAP servers associated with a 
     particular resource. DNS is susceptible to certain attacks and 
     forgeries which may be used to redirect clients to LDAP servers 
     which are not authoritative for the resource in question. 
      
     This document provides multiple query models which will cause the 
     same query to be answered by different servers (one would be 
     processed by a delegation entity, while another would be processed 
     by an operational entity). As a result, each of the servers may 
     provide different information, depending upon the query type that 
     was originally selected. 
      
     Some operators may choose to purposefully provide misleading or 
     erroneous information in an effort to avoid responsibility for bad 
     behavior. In addition, there are likely to be sporadic operator 
     errors which will result in confusing or erroneous answers. 
      
     Neither this specification nor the LDAPv3 protocol currently 
     provide cache timers or any other mechanisms which can indicate 
     how accurate or timely any replicas may be. As a result, it is 
     possible for a replica to become significantly outdated, even to 
     the point of containing wholesale errors. 
      
     For all of the reasons listed above, it is essential that 
     applications and end-users not make critical decisions based on 
     the information provided by the FIRS service without having reason 
     to believe the veracity of the information. Users should limit 
     unknown or untrusted information to routine purposes. 
      
     Despite these disclaimers, however, it is very likely that the 
     information presented through the FIRS service will be used for 
     many operational and problem-resolution purposes. In order to 
     ensure the veracity of the information, a minimal set of 
     operational guidelines are provided herein. For the most part, 
     these rules are designed to prevent unauthorized modifications to 
     the data. 
      
     Note that these rules only apply to data which is willingly 
     provided; no data is required to be entered, but where the data is 
     provided, it SHOULD be validated as accurate on entry, and it MUST 
     be secured against unauthorized modifications.

        *   The inetResources container entry and all of the resource-
            specific subordinate entries within every public DIT that 
            provides FIRS resources SHOULD have anonymous read-only 
            access permissions, and SHOULD NOT have anonymous add, 
            delete or modify permissions. 
      
        *   With the exception of contact-related attributes from the 
            inetOrgPerson object class, each attribute MAY have 
            whatever restrictions are necessary in order to suit local 
            security policies, government regulations or personal 
            privacy concerns. When the inetOrgPerson object class is 
            used to provide contact details, the mail attribute MUST be 
            defined, SHOULD be valid, SHOULD have read-only anonymous 
            access, and SHOULD NOT have anonymous add, delete or modify 
            permissions. 
      
            By using the inetOrgPerson object class, it is expected 
            that existing contact-related entries can be reused. If 
            reusing these entries is undesirable or unfeasible, entries 
            with the necessary access SHOULD be made available. 
      
            Note that contact pointers are entirely optional and are 
            not required to exist. However, where they exist, they MUST 
            comply with the above requirements. 
      
        *   End-users and implementers SHOULD provide anonymous access 
            to the creatorsName, createTimestamp, modifiersName and 
            modifyTimestamp operational attributes associated with each 
            entry in the inetResources branch, since this information 
            is useful for determining the age of the information. 
      
        *   Server administrators MAY define additional add, delete or 
            modify permissions for authenticated users, using any 
            LDAPv3 authentication mechanisms they wish. In particular, 
            delegation entities MAY provide for the remote management 
            of delegated resources (such as assigning modification 
            privileges to the managers of a particular delegated domain 
            or address block), although this is entirely optional, and 
            is within the sole discretion of the delegation body. 
      
     Finally, there are physical security issues associated with any 
     service which provides physical addressing and delivery 
     information. Although organizations are generally encouraged to 
     provide as much information as they feel comfortable with, no 
     information is required.

  9.      IANA Considerations 
      
     The FIRS collection of specifications define an application of the 
     LDAPv3 protocol rather than a new Internet application protocol. 
     As such, there are no protocol-related IANA considerations. 
      
     However, the FIRS collection of specifications do define several 
     LDAP schema elements, including object classes, attributes, 
     syntaxes and extensibleMatch filters, and these elements should be 
     assigned OID values from the IANA branch. Furthermore, some of the 
     specifications define their own status codes as attribute values, 
     and IANA is expected to maintain the code-point mapping values 
     associated with these attributes. 
      
     Finally, some of the specifications also describe public DNS and 
     LDAP servers and data. It is expected that IANA will see to the 
     establishment and maintenance of these servers and data.

     Funding for the RFC editor function is currently provided by the 
     Internet Society. 
      
     Portions of this document were funded by Verisign Labs. 
      
     The first version of this specification was co-authored by Andrew 
     Newton of Verisign Labs, and subsequent versions continue to be 
     developed with his active participation. 
      
  14.     Changes from Previous Versions 
      
     draft-ietf-crisp-firs-arch-01: 
      
        *   Several clarifications and corrections have been made. 
      
     draft-ietf-crisp-firs-arch-00: 
      
        *   Restructured document set, separating the architectural 
            discussion from the technical descriptions. 
      
        *   Consolidated the security discussions. 
      
     draft-ietf-crisp-lw-core-00: 
      
        *   As a result of the formation of the CRISP working group, 
            the original monolithic document has been broken into 
            multiple documents, with draft-ietf-crisp-lw-core 
            describing the core service, while related documents 
            describe the per-resource schema and access mechanisms. 
      
        *   References to the ldaps: URL scheme have been removed, 
            since there is no standards-track specification for the 
            ldaps: scheme. 
      
        *   An acknowledgements section was added. 
      
     draft-hall-ldap-whois-01: 
      
        *   The "Objectives" section has been removed. [ir-dir-req] is 
            now being used as the guiding document for this service. 
      
        *   Several typographical errors have been fixed. 
      
        *   Some unnecessary text has been removed.

  Internet Draft    draft-ietf-crisp-firs-arch-01.txt         May 2003 
   
   
        *   Figures changed to show complete sets of object classes, to 
            improve inheritance visibility. 
      
        *   Clarified the handling of reverse-lookup domains (zones 
            within the in-addr.arpa portion of the DNS hierarchy) in 
            the inetDnsDomain object class reference text. 
      
        *   Referrals now use regular LDAP URLs (multiple responses 
            with explicit hostnames and port numbers). Prior editions 
            of this specification used LDAP SRV resource records for 
            all referrals. 
      
        *   The delegation status codes used by the 
            inetDnsDelegationStatus, inetIpv4DelegationStatus, 
            inetIpv6DelegationStatus and inetAsnDelegationStatus 
            attributes have been condensed to a more logical set. 
      
        *   Added an inetDnsAuthServers attribute for publishing the 
            authoritative DNS servers associated with a domain. NOTE 
            THAT THIS IS A TEMPORARY ATTRIBUTE THAT WILL EVENTUALLY BE 
            REPLACED BY GENERALIZED RESOURCE-RECORD ENTRIES AND 
            ATTRIBUTES. 
      
        *   Added an inetGeneralDisclaimer attribute for publishing 
            generalized disclaimers. 
      
        *   Added the inetAssociatedResources auxiliary object class 
            for defining associated resources, and moved some of the IP 
            addressing and ASN attributes to the new object class. 
      
        *   Several attributes had their OIDs changed. NOTE THAT THIS 
            IS AN INTERNET DRAFT, AND THAT THE OIDS ARE SUBJECT TO 
            ADDITIONAL CHANGES AS THIS DOCUMENT IS EDITED.
