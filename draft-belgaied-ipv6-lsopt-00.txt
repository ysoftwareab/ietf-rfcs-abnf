Abstract

   This memo describes a new IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Option type used as an
   explicit security label. The hosts supporting Labeled Security
   add this option to the packets they originate in order to convey the 
   sensitivity of the data. The routers that recognize this
   option will use it to make routing decision, in conformance with a
   pre-established policy. The IPSec protection requirements and a
   transition scheme from the existing IPv4 security options to the LS
   option are also proposed.

INTERNET-DRAFT       Generalized LS Option for IPv6        Feb. 22, 2001


1.  Introduction

   Information in a multilevel security environment is labeled. The
   label of a process may represent the credentials of that process.
   The label on an object (file, device, ...) may represent the
   sensitivity, as in the Bell and Lapadula model [BL73], the
   integrity, as in the Biba model [Bib77], or other security
   attributes of the data.

   Multilevel secure operating systems enforce a set of mandatory
   access control rules, in order to guarantee that information is
   protected to a certain level of assurance, that can be evaluated
   according to predefined criteria [LSPP], [DoD85].
   
   In order to enforce those access controls across a network,
   routing needs to be controlled so as to select specific
   network links in accordance with the security policy [DoD87],
   and host need to be able to retrieve the security attributes of
   data coming from the network, and to communicate those of
   their own processes when they access data at remote hosts.

   Making the security attributes of the information available to the
   entities that need it can be achieved by either explicitly or
   implicitly labeling the IP packets, as discussed in [RFC-1457],
   Security Labeling Framework for the Internet.
   Dedicating an IPSec security association for each sensitivity
   level is one way of implicit labeling [RFC-2401]. I has the advantage
   of tying the security attribute of the information to an SA, thus
   guaranteeing that the former is always protected by the latter.
   The implicit labeling has the following limitations though:
   . Scalability. Implicit binding of security attributes to SAs may
     be sufficient when there is a small set of values for those
     attributes. Communicating LS systems may exchange data at a wide
     range of sensitivities, produced by processes with varying
     credentials, and would need a separate SA for each combination.
   . Practical consideration. Although an IPSec SA can scale down to
     selectively protect a single socket (one connection / liaison), 
     it is more efficient in practice to aggregate the flows by broader
     selectors, like host or subnet addresses or transport level port
     numbers, due to the cost of the SA establishment including the key
     management.
   . Routers cannot figure out the security attributes of the packets,
     unless they are members of the security association.

   IPv4 had previous experience with explicit labeling:
   [RFC-1108] defined the IPSO, a security option in the IPv4 header
   that can be used for a small number of possible labels mainly in
   use by the US Government.
   An IETF working group, cipso, was later formed to propose an IP
   labeling scheme more suitable to commercial use, and did produce
   an Internet draft, the Common IP Security Option specification.

INTERNET-DRAFT       Generalized LS Option for IPv6        Feb. 22, 2001


   Although the IETF draft expired, the proposal was adopted in 1994 by
   the US Government as a Federal Information Processing Standard
   (FIPS) [CIPSO].

   IPv6 [RFC2460] offers a convenient mechanism to carry ancillary data
   with packets, using options in the hop-by-hop and the destination
   extension headers. Such an option seems to be the natural choice
   for use as security label for IPv6 packets.

   The remainder of this memo proposes a generalized approach to
   the explicit labeling for IPv6 packet and to the migration of the
   currently most used labeling IPv4 options (CIPSO and IPSO) to the
   LS IPv6 option. It applies mainly to the [BL] model, although
   it may be adopted for an integrity model with some limitations.
   We'll also discuss the IPSec [RFC-2401] protection requirements when
   operating in the real world, outside the assumptions of a Trusted
   Computing Base [DoD85].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119].

   Unless otherwise stated, references to the link-local, site-local
   or global addressing scopes mean both unicast and multicast address
   types, as defined in [RFC-2373].


2.  LS option specification

   2.1.  Syntax

   The general format of an LS option is:

                                    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                    |   LSOPT type  |  Opt Data len |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |          Domain of Interpretation (len = 4 octets)            |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                                                               |
    .              Variable Length Option Data                      .
    .                                                               .
    .                                                               .
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   All the fields are stored in the network-byte order.

   LSOPT type's value is an octet value to be requested from IANA,
   with the following constraints:
   . First 2 MSB are 00, instructing the non supporting nodes to skip
     over this option and continue processing the header
   . The next MSB is 0, indicating that the Option Data does not change
     en-route

draft-belgaied-ipv6-lsopt-00.txt                                [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT       Generalized LS Option for IPv6        Feb. 22, 2001


   The Opt Data length is expressed in octets.

   The Domain of Interpretation field is a 4 octet integer that
   identifies the semantics of the option data to follow. Communicating
   nodes have to agree on a common interpretation of the LS option
   before acting upon it. 

   The value DOI=0 is dedication for the transition from IPv4 security
   options.

   This specification proposes also to reserve the values 1-255.

   The option Data option is a list of self-describing tags.
   Each tag has the following format:

          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+---------+-+
          |    Tag Type   |  Tag Length   | Tag Information |
          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+---------+-+

   The Tag Type (TT) identifies the type of the information in the
   Tag Info (TI) field. Tag length (TL) to total length of the tag,
   expressed in octets.

   The following types are predefined in this document. The
   implementations are required to use them in the way indicated herein.
   All these tag types can be used in both hop-by-hop and destination
   headers, unless otherwise specified.
   We also provide how entities of each type are compared.

   TT 1: The tag is a hierarchical 2-octet entity.
         TL is 4.
         This can be thought of as a level or classification.
         The comparison of fields of this type is the conventional
         mathematical relation (<=, <, >, >=, ==, !=)

   TT 2: Non-hierarchical bit-vector.
         TL is a variable number of octets. TL MUST be an even number.
         This type is intended for categories/compartments bit sets.
         The comparison of fields of this type is the inclusion
         relation.

   TT 3: Enumeration.
         TL is a variable number of octets.
         This is a list of items. Each item is a short. It is a
         compact way of coding  categories and compartments.
         The comparison of fields of this type is the inclusion
         relation.

   TT 4: List of ranges.
         TL is a variable number of octets. TL must be a 4n+2 integer.
         Each range has 2 shorts: lower and upper boundaries of the


draft-belgaied-ipv6-lsopt-00.txt                                [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT       Generalized LS Option for IPv6        Feb. 22, 2001


         interval. The intervals MUST NOT overlap.
         The ranges are intended as an efficient grouping of categories
         and compartments.
         The comparison of fields of this type is the inclusion
         relation.

   TT 5: IPv4-Compatible option.
         TL is a variable number of octets. TL must be an even
         number.
         This tag contains an IPv4 security option.
         The intent of this tag is to provide an easy transition to IPv6
         for the LS systems that already use legacy IPv4 options.

   TT 6: Destination-only data
         TL is a variable number of octets in this TI. TL must be an
         even number.
         Only the destinations that understand the DOI are able to
         interpret it.
         This option is not understood by routers when present in a
         hop-by-hop header and MUST be skipped.

   TT 7-255: Available for future use, to be requested from IANA.
      
   
   2.2 Alignment

   The DOI MUST be aligned on an 8n+4 octet boundary.

   If the packet contains other options in the hop-by-hop extension
   header, Pad1 or PadN options MUST be used in order to ensure the
   DOI in the LS option fall in that boundary, in accordance with
   the formatting guidelines in [RFC2460]
   
   Tags MUST be aligned so that their fields fall in their natural
   boundaries.

   2.3  Order and coexistence of Tags

   For implementation efficiency, fields with fixed size (TT1) MUST
   appear first, when present.

   The LS option MAY carry more than one tag of the same type, however,
   only the first tag of that type will be used for consistency checks
   at the interfaces.

   In order to avoid ambiguity, IPv4 compatibility tags MUST NOT be
   used with other tags.

3.  Functional specification

   3.1 Domain of Interpretation

   Communicating hosts sharing the same set of security policies and a
   common interpretation of security attributes will use a unique value
   of the DOI in the labels of the packets they exchange.
   The DOI identifies the security domain made of that collection of
   hosts.

   For example, a label with a classification field TT1=5, may mean
   "public information" for a company A. Another company, B, may choose
   to assign the "competition-sensitive information" meaning to the
   same value, TT1=5. Obviously A and B cannot use TT1=5 to
   label packets between them. However, if A and B agree on a common
   set of labels and how to interpret them, they have to choose a
   unique DOI value, C, that identifies that common understanding.
   A and B will have to choose different DOI values for communication
   within their respective domains.

   A host can be a member of several domains, and use a different DOI
   value for communicating with peers in each.

   When A and B in the example above use the services of an application
   server provided by an outsourcing company, the server can be a
   member of the 3 domains, A, B and the C. It will use labels with DOI
   A to communicate with A, for instance, and apply the policy
   enforcement checks suitable for DOI A, in choosing routes or offering
   the appropriate IPSec protection, 
   The server will use the DOI C for packets addressed to a multicast
   group containing both A and B.

   3.2  Interface protection table

   An implementation that supports the LS option may associate with
   each network interface a table that specifies what domains of 
   interpretations are supported and what are the constraints on the
   packets coming through or going out of that interface, for a given
   DOI.

   An example of such a table would look like:

                  DOI    |         Constraints
               ----------+-----------------------------------
                  doi1   |   TT1: [min-max]
                         |   TT2: <some bit vector V]
                         |   TT3: {item1, ..., itemN}
                         |   TT4: [r11,r12], .... [r1N-r1M]
               ----------+-----------------------------------
                  doi2   |   TT1: ....
                         .
                         .
                         .
draft-belgaied-ipv6-lsopt-00.txt                                [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT       Generalized LS Option for IPv6        Feb. 22, 2001



   A label is admitted through an interface if it passes the constraints
   defined on that interface, for the label's DOI.
   If the node does not recognize the DOI of the packet then it MUST
   be discarded.

   For the predefined tag types, passing the constraint means:

   TT1: the tag value is within the range.
   TT2: All the bits set in the packet label bit vector MUST be set in
        the interface's bit vector.
   TT3: All the items enumerated in the label belong to either a TT3 or
        a TT4 on the interface.
   TT4: All the items in the ranges enumerated in the label belong to
        either a TT3 or a TT4 on the interface.

   The way of checking the destination-only tags is part of the
   agreement between the endpoints.
 

   3.3 Host behavior

   The implementation SHOULD use the LS option in a destination
   extension header when:
   . The security information is relevant to the endpoint only.
   . Non trusted entities can access the packet en route, mandating
     the use of ESP's [RFC-2406] protection in order to preserve
     confidentiality.
   . The destination address is a link-local one.

   The following is the typical sequence of operations a sending and
   receiving host will perform, including the ICMPv6 packets to be
   generated [RFC-2463]:

      3.3.1  Originating host:

      . Choose a route to destination and an outgoing interface that
        conforms the security attributes of the packet to be sent.

      . If no route was  found, locally generate an ICMPv6 error message
        with type 1: Destination unreachable, code 1: communication
        with destination administratively prohibited.

      . Create the LS option from the packet's security attributes,
        and add it to the packet in the appropriate extension header.

      . Calculate and add the ESP and or the AH [RFC-2402] header as
        necessary.

      . Send the packet out.



draft-belgaied-ipv6-lsopt-00.txt                                [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT       Generalized LS Option for IPv6        Feb. 22, 2001


      3.3.2  Destination host:

      . Authenticate the packet and log an audit record on failure.

      . Check if the packet was allowed through the incoming interface
        and log an audit record on failure.
        If the failure was due to an unrecognized DOI  for this
        interface then send back an ICMPv6 error message with
        type 1 and code 1. If the incoming packet was encrypted, then
        the returned ICMPv6 MUST NOT contain any clear portion of the
        original packet.

	Rationale: The packet was authentic, so the failure is either
           due to a subject on the originating host attempting to defy
           the security policy, or there is a misconfiguration in the
           network. In both cases, the ICMPv6 is useful to the
           originating host'administrator to help identify the
           violating subject, or to figure out which nodes have the
           wrong settings on their interface protection tables.
        
       . Retreive the security attributes from the label and deliver
         the packet to the right client.

   3.4  Router behavior

   One of the design considerations was to suggest a way for routers
   to implement the support for the LS option, without requiring that
   they understand the meaning of the labels, yet enforce the label
   checks necessary for the security policy in a multilevel security
   environment.

   Routers that do not understand the LS option will simply skip over
   it, as mandated by the choice of the LS option type.

   A router needs to trust the authenticity and integrity of a
   packet before making routing decision based on the content of its
   label. This is a strong assumption, however there are situations
   when it may apply. Examples include operating in a restricted
   environment where there is control on what devices are physically
   sharing the network, and on what privileges processes are granted.
   Another example is when the router is acting as the secure gateway
   that will provide the IPSec protection and possibly add the security
   label on behalf of non LS hosts. A multi-site organization
   usually has very good control on who accesses what inside
   each site, but needs secure gateways to communicate between sites.

   A router ([RFC2401] and [DoD87]) may associate with each
   interface a set of sensitivity information allowed to or forbidden
   from flowing through that interface.




draft-belgaied-ipv6-lsopt-00.txt                                [Page 9]

INTERNET-DRAFT       Generalized LS Option for IPv6        Feb. 22, 2001


   The router MUST perform the accreditation checks described in the
   previous section on both the incoming and outgoing interface for all
   the site-local packets. When discarding violating packets, the
   routers MUST send an ICMPv6 Type 1, code 1 back to the originator
   of the packet.

   When routing OUT non-site local packets, if the router is acting as
   the secure gateway that will add the ESP or AH header, then it MUST
   use the explicit label on the packet to:
   . Select the right security association to use for the flow to be
     protected, in accordance with the security policy.
   . perform the incoming interface accreditation checks.

   When routing IN non-site local packets, if the router is acting as
   the secure gateway at the receiving end of the SA, then it MUST
   . Retrieve the explicit label from the packet (after decryption and
     authentication)
   . forward the packet in using a route and an interface permitted for
     the packet.
    IPSec authentication failure MUST NOT generate an ICMPv6 back,
    however, the implementations SHOULD increment a counter of the
    number of such failures, and, optionally, log an audit record.
    The router MUST send an ICMPv6 Type 1, code 1 back to the originator
    of an authentic packets failing the forwarding accreditation checks,
    however, it MUST NOT send any decrypted portion of the original
    one.

   In all the other cases, routers MUST skip the LS option.
   There are three reasons for this recommendation:
   . Although it is possible to have enough control inside a site, and
     therefore trust the clear header on a packet, it is impossible to
     to guarantee that condition across the Internet, without the
     router being involved in at least an AH SA.
   . Doing anything other than silently skipping the option for alien
     packets opens an easy denial of service exposure.
   . There is no global registration for the registration for the DOI
     values and the way to interpret them,  so a router is unlikely
     to choose the same interpretation meant by the originator of the
     packet.


4. Deployment considerations

   4.1 Policy information setting

   The mechanism of distributing the security policy constraints on all
   the nodes of a site implementing the LS option is beyond the scope
   of this memo. However, one way to approach this problem is to use a
   mechanism similar to the RSVP [RFC-2205]. Both situation face the
   problem of segregating the treatment one flow of information gets.
   In one case, it is based on the resources reserved for that flow,


draft-belgaied-ipv6-lsopt-00.txt                               [Page 10]

INTERNET-DRAFT       Generalized LS Option for IPv6        Feb. 22, 2001


   in the other case it is based on its security attributes.
   Similarly to what is proposed for RSVP in [RFC-2749], the LS case
   may use the framework provided by the Common Open Policy Service
   protocol (COPS) [RFC-2748].
   A central PDP (Policy Decision Point) node would have knowledge of
   the topology of a site and sensitivity associated with each link
   in that site (identified by its prefixes, for example), and the
   hosts and routers would, acting as PEPs (Policy Enforcement Points),
   use the attributes of a link in order to set the protection table on 
   their interfaces connected to that link.

   4.2  IPv4 Security Options Transition

   The following are optional guidelines for the existing
   implementations that use IPv4 security options and wish to migrate
   to IPv6, in the order of preference:

   . Use implicit labeling if the amount of security information is
     small enough.

   . Translate the IPv4 option in order to map to the proposed format.
     A separate document specifying the translation of legacy IPv4
     option should be proposed.

   . Use the DOI=0 dedicated for the IPv4 options compatible mode
     only, and use a Tag type 5 to carry the full IPv4 option inside
     an LS option. The tag will have the same syntax and semantics
     of the IPv4 option, and MUST be interpreted by the supporting nodes
     as if it came in an IPv4 packet.

   4.3  Key management

   During the deployment, the key management traffic MUST NOT introduce
   an additional vulnerability to the flows to be protected by SAs
   established using that key management. Ideally, the key management
   traffic follows the trusted path reserved for information at
   the highest sensitivity it will help protect. However, since the SAs
   are yet to be established, the labels on the key management packets
   are not protected, and not guaranteed any authenticity. Solving this
   issue is beyond the scope of this document, but the users should be
   aware of its existence.


5.  Security Considerations

   When deploying this explicit labeling scheme, the authenticity and
   the integrity of the labels and the data being labeled MUST be
   guaranteed. Unless operating inside a perimeter of trust that
   isolates the network, AH must be used, as required by [RFC2401].
   The implementations SHOULD make the requirement for
   AH when LS option is present as a configurable parameter, leaving

   that policy choice to the discretion of the administrator.

   The immutability requirement is a potential limitation to the use of
   the LS option as an integrity label. When data is handled by an
   entity with an integrity label lower than the integrity label of the
   data, the data has to be relabeled with the integrity label of the
   entity. This limitation can be overcome by the use of ESP when the
   inegrity label is in a destination extention header (the case of
   link local scope) and the use of both AH and ESP when the label is
   in the hop-by-hop header (site or global scope). The confidence that
   is placed in encrypted and authentic data is therefore preserved,
   eliminating the need for relabeling.


6.  IANA Considerations   

   The value of the LS option type is to be registered and maintained
   by IANA.
   New reserved DOI values, and  new tag types are to be assigned via
   IETF Consensus as defined in RFC 2434 [RFC-2434].
