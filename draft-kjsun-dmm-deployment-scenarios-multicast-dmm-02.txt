Internet-Draft Multicast deployment scenario over DMM        July 2015


Abstract

   This document presents deployment scenarios for supporting IP
   multicast over distributed mobility management (DMM) architecture,
   which considers the separation of the control and the data planes.
   This document describes three main use cases of IP multicast
   deployments over DMM depending on the placement of control and data
   plane functional entities.

1. Introduction

   Distributed mobility management is a new paradigm to solve current
   problems of centralized mobility management, such as a single point
   of failure, non-optimal routing [RFC7333].

   IP multicast is an efficient content distribution mechanism which is
   designed with the IP mobility to bring new user experience and
   reduce bandwidth cost. In the [RFC7333], one requirement for DMM is
   to enable multicast solutions to avoid the inefficiency in the
   multicast traffic delivery.

   Existing solutions for supporting multicast in DMM are bi-
   directional tunnel [TUNNEL] and direct routing [ROUTING]. These
   solutions focus on the placement of MLD proxy and multicast router
   functions into the Mobility Access Router.

   The current architecture of the DMM is being changed to employ the
   concept of data and control plane separation. The data plane nodes

   are configured by the control nodes via Forwarding Policy
   Configuration protocol, as defined in [PFPC]. The several deployment
   scenarios were presented in [DEPLOYMENT].

   However, there is no work until now, mentioning about multicast
   support in such new DMM architectures. Therefore, this document
   presents possible deployment scenarios, which support multicast
   listener in the DMM architectures based on the concept of the data
   and control planes separation.

2. Functional Decomposition

   Two options for deploying the multicast over conventional
   distributed mobility management (i.e. without the control and data
   plane separation) are MLD Proxy and Multicast router [RFC3810]
   [RFC4605]. This section decomposes functions of MLD Proxy and
   Multicast router that are required to deliver the multicast traffic
   with the respect to the concept of data and control planes
   separation.

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC4605] and
   [RFC3810]. Also, new entities are defined relying on the concept of
   data and control planes separation and the functional decomposition.

   - CMA (Control plane Multicast Anchor): CMA consists of the control
      plane functions of the multicast router (Multicast Anchor). CMA is
      responsible for joining the multicast tree.
   - DMA (Data plane Multicast Anchor): DMA is the topological anchor
      point for multicast channels, subscribed by the MN. DMA provides
      packet treatment functions, such as packet forwarding, packet
      encapsulation. The DMA can be configured by the CMA via Forwarding
      Policy Configuration (FPC) protocol
   - CMN (Control plane Multicast Node): CMN is responsible for
      control plane functions of MLD-Proxy (multicast node) as described
      in the previous section.
   - DMN (Data plane Multicast Node): DMN is located at the first-hop
      router where the MN is attached. The DMN has the protocol
      interface with the CMN for configuration.

   We identify different deployment use cases for supporting multicast
   over such DMM architecture. Basically, these use cases result from
   the placement of CMA/DMA, CMN/DMN functional entities defined above.

Internet-Draft Multicast deployment scenario over DMM         Oct 2015


   Figure 1 depicts the four deployment scenarios for multicast
   mobility over DMM architecture.

   In the use case 01, the control plane and data plane are separated
   in both multicast anchor and multicast node

   In the use case 02, the control planes for multicast anchor and
   multicast node are combined, the DMN and DMA are deployed on
   separate access gateway.

   In the use case 03, the DMN and DMA can be collocated on the same
   access gateway.

   In the use case 04, the access gateway has only the functions of DMA

             Figure 2 Protocol operations in split all use case

   In this use case, when the MN attaches to the new access gateway and
   subscribes a multicast channel, the DMN will relay the multicast
   subscription messages (i.e. MLD Report) to the CMN. The CMN
   aggregates and exchanges the membership information with the CMA.
   The CMA sends control messages to join the multicast tree. The CMN
   and CMA configures the DMN and DMA using the sounth bound protocol
   (e.g. the Forwarding Policy Configuration (FPC) protocol [PFPC]) to
   forward the multicast traffic. Here, the multicast traffic will be
   encapsulated at the DMA and sent to the DMN. Figure 2 shows protocol
   operation in the split all use case.

4.2. Use Case 2: Distributed Multicast Data Plane

   In this use case, the CMN and CMA are combined into one multicast
   control entity (MC), but the DMN and DMA are deployed in separate
   access gateways. The MC takes care of receiving the multicast
   subscription from the MN and joins the multicast infrastructure. The
   multicast traffic is delivered to the DMA, here encapsulated and
   sent to the DMN. Figure 3 shows the protocol operation in
   distributed multicast data plane use case.

   In this use case, the DMA and DMN can be collocated into one access
   gateway. On a multicast channel basis, the respective functions are
   activated for a new multicast channel. It means that when the MN
   subscribes to a new multicast channel, which wasn't subscribed at
   the previous DMA. The new DMA function in the access gateway will be
   activated. In this case, the multicast traffic for old channel
   (subscribed at the previous DMA) will be encapsulated and sent
   between the previous DMA and current DMN. The multicast traffic for
   new channel will be delivered to the new DMA function at the current
   access gateway. Figure 4 shows the protocol operation in the
   collaboration of the multicast anchor and multicast node use case.

   Figure 5 Protocol operations in floating multicast anchor use case

   In this use case, the access gateway assumes the function of DMA and
   there is no DMN function. The CMA receives the subscription
   information from the MN and joins the multicast tree. At the same
   time, the CMA configures the DMA to receive the multicast traffic.
   Figure 5 shows the protocol operation in the floating multicast
   anchor use case.

5. Integration with the deployment models for unicast traffic
   Compared to the normal unicast case, some main multicast 
   functional entities are defined in this draft. However, there are
   some overlaps among functional entities for unicast and multicast 
   cases. For examples, the DMA and DMN have the same functions as 
   the normal data plane nodes in the unicast case. Thus, to facilitate
   the integration between unicast and multicast, one common name 
   should be defined for data plane nodes in both cases.
