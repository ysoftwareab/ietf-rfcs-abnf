Abstract

   This document describes a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for
   the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) for naming persistent
   resources defined within EBU technical documentation and Internet 
   resources. Example resources include technical documents and 
   specifications, eXtensible Markup Language(XML) Schemas, 
   classification schemes, XML Document Type Definitions (DTDs), 
   namespaces, style sheets, media assets, and other types of resources 
   produced or managed by EBU.

1.  Introduction

   The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) is the largest non-for profit 
   professional association of broadcasters worldwide established 
   since 1950. The Union has more than 70 active members in 55
   countries in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, and more 
   than 40 associate members in 25 countries further afield. The
   EBU negotiates broadcasting rights for major sport events, operates 
   the Eurovision and Euroradio networks, organises programme exchanges 
   and co-productions, and provides other operational, and legal 
   support. It provides technical advice to its members and favours the 
   adoption of standardised solutions in broadcast systems from content 
   ingest to end-user delivery. EBU activities cover traditional 
   broadcast and new delivery medias such as the Internet for which a 
   growing number or resources are being developped.

   EBU would like to assign unique, permanent, location-independent
   names based on URNs for some resources it produces or manages.

   This namespace specification is for a formal namespace.

Internet Draft                 EBU URN                    March 20, 2007


   Declaration of structure:

      URNs assigned by EBU will have the following hierarchical
      structure based on the organisational structure of the EBU
      resources:

         urn:tva:{category}:{string}

      where "{category}" and "{string}" are US-ASCII strings that
      conforms to URN Syntax requirements ([RFC2141]).

      The individual URNs will be assigned by EBU through the process 
      of development of EBU resources.


   Relevant ancillary documentation:

      More information on EBU and relevant technical activities can be 
      found at ([www.ebu.ch]).


   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

      EBU will establish unique identifiers as appropriate.

      Uniqueness is guaranteed as long as the assigned string is never
      reassigned.


   Identifier persistence considerations:

      The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) is committed to maintaining 
      the accessibility and persistence of all resources that are 
      officially assigned URNs by the organization.  Persistence of 
      identifiers is dependent upon suitable delegation at the level of 
      "{category}"s, and persistence of category assignment.


   Process of identifier assignment:

      All the assignment of identifiers are fully controlled and 
      managed by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).

Internet Draft                 EBU URN                    March 20, 2007


   Process of identifier resolution:

      The owner will develop and maintain "URN catalogues" that map all
      assigned URNs to Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) specifically to
      enable Web-based resolution of named resources.  In the future an
      interactive online resolution system may be developed to automate
      this process.

      The owner will authorize additional resolution services as
      appropriate.


   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

      The "{category}" is case-insensitive. Thus, the portion of the
      URN:

                   urn:ebu:{category}:

      is case-insensitive for matches.  The remainder of the identifier
      shall be considered case-sensitive; hence, URNs are only 
      lexically equivalent if they are also lexically identical in the 
      remaining "{string}" field.


   Conformance with URN Syntax:

      No special considerations.


   Validation mechanism:

      The owner will develop and maintain URN
      catalogues.  The presence of a URN in a catalogue indicates that
      it is valid. Validation shall more particularly be done by a 
      syntax grammar corresponding to each "{category}".


   Scope:

      Global

3.  Examples

   The following examples are not guaranteed to be real. They are
   presented for pedagogical reasons only.

      urn:ebu:metadata:pmeta:2007
      urn:ebu:metadata:cs:EscortCS:2007
      urn:other:anytype:version


4.  Namespace Considerations

   URN assignment procedures:

      The individual URNs shall be assigned through the process of
      development of EBU resources by the European Broadcasting Union
      (EBU).

   URN resolution/delegation:

      The resolution and delegation shall be determined through the
      process of development of EBU resources by the European 
      Broadcasting Union (EBU).


   Type of resources to be identified:

      Types of resources to be identified include XML schema definition
      files, classification schemes and identification systems.

   Type of services to be supported:

      Types of services supported include controlled term lookup in
      classification schemes, resolution of ids in identification
      systems.

5.  Community Considerations

 Potential beneficiary communities include:

       a) Implementers and users of EBU resources.

          Resources that comply with the EBU specifications
          (including schemas, instance documents that comply with
          EBU schemas, and EBU default Classification Schemes) may, by 
          means of the registered namespace, become exposed to the
          general Internet and gain from the interoperability benefits 
          of the Internet at large.

       b) Implementers of other specifications that incorporate part of 
          all of available EBU resources.

          URNs used to identify EBU resources may be used to enable
          their inclusion in, and enhancement of, other specifications 
          while maintaining, to a certain degree, interoperability with 
          the EBU (see a) above).

       c) Implementers of other semantically related specifications that 
          do not directly incorporate part or all of EBU resources.

          URNs used to identify EBU resources,such as identifiers of 
          terms within default Classification Schemes, may enable 
          interoperation with other semantically determined 
          specifications (including present and future metadata/resource 
          description and ontology specifications) of relevance to EBU 
          implementation communities (see a) and b)above).

6.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA has registered formal URN namespace XXX, to EBU within the
   IANA registry of URN NIDs.
