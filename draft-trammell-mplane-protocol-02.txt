                     mPlane Protocol Specification
                   draft-trammell-mplane-protocol-02

Abstract

   This document defines the mPlane protocol for coordination of
   heterogeneous network measurement Components: probes and repositories
   that measure, analyze, and store network measurements, data derived
   from measurements, and other ancillary data about elements of the
   network.  The mPlane architecture is defined in terms of
   relationships between Components and Clients which communicate using
   the mPlane protocol defined in this document.

   This revision of the document describes Version 2 of the mPlane
   protocol.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes the mPlane architecture and protocol, which
   is designed to provide control and coordination of heterogeneous
   network measurement tools.  It is based heavily on the mPlane
   project's deliverable 1.4 [D14], and is submitted for the information
   of the Internet engineering community.  Section 3 gives an overview
   of the mPlane architecture, Section 4 defines the protocol
   information model, and Section 5 defines the representations of this
   data model and session protocols over which mPlane is supported.

   Present work is focused on mPlane represented in JSON using
   WebSockets [RFC6455] as a session protocol.

   This revision of the document describes Version 2 of the mPlane
   protocol.

Internet-Draft               mPlane Protocol                October 2016


1.1.  Changes from Revision -00 (Protocol version 1)

   o  WebSockets has been added as a session protocol for the mPlane
      protocol.  Message flow has been modified to fit.

   o  Redemptions have been expanded to allow temporally-scoped partial
      redemption of long-running measurements.

   o  The "object" primitive type has been added to allow structured
      objects to be represented directly in mPlane messages using the
      underlying representation.

   o  A number of obsolete features have been deprecated based on
      implementation and pilot deployment experience, and removed from
      the protocol description:

      *  HTTPS as a session protocol, as it is a poor fit for mPlane's
         exchanges

      *  Callback control, as it is no longer needed without the
         limitations of HTTPS as a session protocol

      *  The Indirection message type, as the same functionality is
         available for all message types using the link section.

      *  Repeating measurements, as their functionality has been
         replaced by partial redemption

   o  References to the "core" registry have been removed, as all
      element registries must in any case be explicitly defined in
      mPlane Capabilities, Specifications, and Results.  An eventual
      proposed standard mPlane protocol would refer to an IANA-managed
      core registry.

1.2.  Changes from Revision -01

   o  Editorial changes only.

2.  Terminology

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: these terms are not necessarily capitalized within
   the document at this time.  Fix this.]

   Client:  An entity which implements the mPlane protocol, receives
      Capabilities published by one or more Components, and sends
      Specifications to those Component(s) to perform measurements and
      analysis.  See Section 3.2.1.

Internet-Draft               mPlane Protocol                October 2016


   Component:  An entity which implements the mPlane protocol specified
      within this document, advertises its Capabilities and accepts
      Specifications which request the use of those Capabilities.  The
      measurements, analyses, storage facilities and other services
      provided by a Component are completely defined by its
      Capabilities.  See Section 3.2.1.

   mPlane Message:  The atomic unit of exchange in the mPlane protocol.
      The treatment of a message at a Client or Component receiving it
      is based upon its type; see Section 4.2.

   Capability:  An mPlane message that contains a statement of a
      Component's ability and willingness to perform a specific
      operation, conveyed from a Component to a Client.  A Capability
      does not represent a guarantee that the specific operation can or
      will be performed at a specific point in time.  See Section 4.2.1

   Specification:  An mPlane message that contains a statement of a
      Client's desire that a Component should perform a specific
      operation, conveyed from a Client to a Component.  It can be
      conceptually viewed as a Capability whose parameters have been
      filled in with values.  See Section 4.2.2.

   Result:  An mPlane message containing a statement produced by a
      Component that a particular measurement was taken and the given
      values were observed, or that a particular operation or analysis
      was performed and a the given values were produced.  It can be
      conceptually viewed as a Specification whose result columns have
      been filled in with values.  See Section 4.2.3.

   Element:  An identifier for a parameter or result column in a
      Capability, Specification, or Result, binding a name to a
      primitive type.  Elements are contained in registries that contain
      the vocabulary from which mPlane Capabilities, Specifications, and
      Results can be built.  See Section 4.1.

3.  Overview of the mPlane Architecture

   mPlane is built around an architecture in which Components provide
   network measurement services and access to stored measurement data
   which they advertise via Capabilities completely describing these
   services and data.  A Client makes use of these Capabilities by
   sending Specifications that respond to them back to the Components.
   Components may then either return Results directly to the Clients or
   sent to some third party via indirect export using an external
   protocol.  The Capabilities, Specifications, and Results are carried
   over the mPlane protocol, defined in detail in this document.  An

Internet-Draft               mPlane Protocol                October 2016


   mPlane measurement infrastructure is built up from these basic
   blocks.

   Components can be roughly classified into probes which generate
   measurement data and repositories which store and analyze measurement
   data, though the difference between a probe and a repository in the
   architecture is merely a matter of the Capabilities it provides.
   Components can be pulled together into an infrastructure by a
   supervisor (see Section 6.1), which presents a Client interface to
   subordinate Components and a Component interface to superordinate
   Clients, aggregating Capabilities into higher-level measurements and
   distributing Specifications to perform them.

   The mPlane protocol is, in essence, a self-describing, error- and
   delay- tolerant remote procedure call (RPC) protocol between Clients
   and Components: each Capability exposes an entry point in the API
   provided by the Component; each Specification embodies an API call;
   and each Result returns the results of an API call.  This arrangement
   is shown in Figure 1 below.

          Figure 1: The simplest form of the mPlane architecture

3.1.  Key Architectural Principles and Features

   mPlane differs from a simple RPC facility in several important ways,
   detailed in the subsections below.

3.1.1.  Flexibility and Extensibility

   First, given the heterogeneity of the measurement tools and
   techniques applied, it is necessary for the protocol to be as
   flexible and extensible as possible.  Therefore, the architecture in
   its simplest form consists of only two entities and one relationship,
   as shown in the diagram below: n Clients connect to m Components via



Trammell & Kuehlewind    Expires April 30, 2017                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft               mPlane Protocol                October 2016


   the mPlane protocol.  Anything which can speak the mPlane protocol
   and exposes Capabilities thereby is a Component; anything which can
   understand these Capabilities and send Specifications to invoke them
   is a Client.  Everything a Component can do, from the point of view
   of mPlane, is entirely described by its Capabilities.  Capabilities
   are even used to expose optional internal features of the protocol
   itself, and provide a method for built-in protocol extensibility.

3.1.2.  Schema-centric Measurement Definition

   Second, given the flexibility required above, the key to measurement
   interoperability is the comparison of data types.  Each Capability,
   Specification, and Result contains a schema, comprising the set of
   parameters required to execute a measurement or query and the columns
   in the data set that results.  From the point of view of mPlane, the
   schema completely describes the measurement.  This implies that when
   exposing a measurement using mPlane, the developer of a Component
   must build each Capabilities it advertises such that the semantics of
   the measurement are captured by the set of columns in its schema.
   The elements from which schemas can be built are captured in a type
   registry.  The mPlane platform provides a core registry for common
   measurement use cases within the project, and the registry facility
   is itself fully extensible as well, for supporting new applications
   without requiring central coordination beyond the domain or set of
   domains running the application.

3.1.3.  Iterative Measurement Support

   Third, the exchange of messages in the protocol was chosen to support
   iterative measurement in which the aggregated, high-level results of
   a measurement are used as input to a decision process to select the
   next measurement.  Specifically, the protocol blends control messages
   (Capabilities and Specifications) and data messages (Results) into a
   single workflow.

3.1.4.  Weak Imperativeness

   Fourth, the mPlane protocol is weakly imperative.  A Capability
   represents a willingness and an ability to perform a given
   measurement or execute a query, but not a guarantee or a reservation
   to do so.  Likewise, a Specification contains a set of parameters and
   a temporal scope for a measurement a Client wishes a Component to
   perform on its behalf, but execution of Specifications is best-
   effort.  A Specification is not an instruction which must Result
   either in data or in an error.  This property arises from our
   requirement to support large-scale measurement infrastructures with
   thousands of similar Components, including resource- and
   connectivity-limited probes such as smartphones and customer-premises



Trammell & Kuehlewind    Expires April 30, 2017                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft               mPlane Protocol                October 2016


   equipment (CPE) like home routers.  These may be connected to a
   supervisor only intermittently.  In this environment, the operability
   and conditions in which the probes find themselves may change more
   rapidly than can be practicably synchronized with a central
   supervisor; requiring reliable operation would compromise scalability
   of the architecture.

   To support weak imperativeness, each message in the mPlane protocol
   is self- contained, and contains all the information required to
   understand the message.  For instance, a Specification contains the
   complete information from the Capability which it responds to, and a
   Result contains its Specification.  In essence, this distributes the
   state of the measurements running in an infrastructure across all
   Components, and any state resynchronization that is necessary after a
   disconnect happens implicitly as part of message exchange.  The
   failure of a Component during a large-scale measurement can be
   detected and corrected after the fact, by examining the totality of
   the generated data.

   This distribution of state throughout the measurement infrastructure
   carries with it a distribution of responsibility: a Component holding
   a Specification is responsible for ensuring that the measurement or
   query that the Specification describes is carried out, because the
   Client or supervisor which has sent the Specification does not
   necessarily keep any state for it.

   Error handling in a weakly imperative environment is different to
   that in traditional RPC protocols.  The exception facility provided
   by mPlane is designed only to report on failures of the handling of
   the protocol itself.  Each Component and Client makes its best effort
   to interpret and process any authorized, well-formed mPlane protocol
   message it receives, ignoring those messages which are spurious or no
   longer relevant.  This is in contrast with traditional RPC protocols,
   where even common exceptional conditions are signaled, and
   information about missing or otherwise defective data must be
   correlated from logs about measurement control.  This traditional
   design pattern is not applicable in infrastructures where the
   supervisor has no control over the functionality and availability of
   its associated probes.

3.2.  Entities and Relationships

   The entities in the mPlane protocol and the relationships among them
   are described in more detail in the subsections below.

Internet-Draft               mPlane Protocol                October 2016


3.2.1.  Components and Clients

   Specifically, a Component is any entity which implements the mPlane
   protocol specified within this document, advertises its Capabilities
   and accepts Specifications which request the use of those
   Capabilities.  The measurements, analyses, storage facilities and
   other services provided by a Component are completely defined by its
   Capabilities.

   Conversely, a Client is any entity which implements the mPlane
   protocol, receives Capabilities published by one or more Components,
   and sends Specifications to those Component(s) to perform
   measurements and analysis.

   Every interaction in the mPlane protocol takes place between a
   Component and a Client.  Indeed, the simplest instantiation of the
   mPlane architecture consists of one or more Clients taking
   Capabilities from one or more Components, and sending Specifications
   to invoke those Capabilities, as shown in Figure 1.  An mPlane domain
   may consist of as little as a single Client and a single Component.
   In this arrangement, mPlane provides a measurement-oriented RPC
   mechanism.

3.2.2.  Probes and Repositories

   Measurement Components can be roughly divided into two categories:
   probes and repositories.  Probes perform measurements, and
   repositories provide access to stored measurements, analysis of
   stored measurements, or other access to related external data
   sources.  External databases and data sources (e.g., routing looking
   glasses, WHOIS services, DNS, etc.) can be made available to mPlane
   Clients through repositories acting as gateways to these external
   sources, as well.

   Note that this categorization is very rough: what a Component can do
   is completely described by its Capabilities, and some Components may
   combine properties of both probes and repositories.

3.3.  Message Types and Message Exchange Sequences

   The basic messages in the mPlane protocol are Capabilities,
   Specifications, and Results, as described above.  The full protocol
   contains other message types as well.  Withdrawals cancel
   Capabilities (i.e., indicate that the Component is no longer capable
   or willing to perform a given measurement) and interrupts cancel
   Specifications (i.e., indicate that the Component should stop
   performing the measurement).  Receipts can be given in lieu of
   Results for not-yet completed measurements or queries, and

   redemptions can be used to retrieve Results referred to by a receipt.
   Exceptions can be sent by Clients or Components at any time to signal
   protocol-level errors to their peers.

   The following sequences of messages are possible within the mPlane
   protocol:

   Client                 Component
     |<---------- Capability -|   ( direct response )
     |- Specification ------->|
     |<-------------- Result -|
     |                        |
     |<---------- Capability -|   ( delayed response )
     |- Specification ------->|
     |<------------- Receipt -|
     |         . . .          |
     |- (Redemption) -------->|
     |<-------------- Result -|
     |                        |
     |<---------- Capability -|   ( indirect export )
     |- Specification ------->|
     |<------------- Receipt -|
     |.... indirect export ...|
     |- (Interrupt) --------->|
     |                        |
     |<---------- Capability -|   ( eventual withdrawal )
     |         . . .          |
     |<---------- Withdrawal -|

      Figure 2: Possible sequences of messages in the mPlane protocol

   In the nominal sequence, a Capability leads to a Specification leads
   to a Result, where Results may be transmitted by some other protocol.
   All the paths through the sequence of messages are shown in the
   diagram above; message types are described in detail in Section 4.2.

   Separate from the sequence of messages, the mPlane protocol supports
   two connection establishment patterns:

   o  Client-initiated, in which Clients connect directly to Components
      at known, stable URLs.  Client-initiated workflows are intended
      for use between Clients and supervisors, for access to
      repositories, and for access to probes embedded within a network
      infrastructure.

   o  Component-initiated, in which Components initiate connections to
      Clients.  Component-initiated workflows are intended for use
      between Components without stable routable addresses and

      supervisors, e.g. for small probes on embedded devices, mobile
      devices, or software probes embedded in browsers on personal
      computers behind network-address translators (NATs) or firewalls
      which prevent a Client from establishing a connection to them.

   Within a given mPlane domain, these patterns can be combined (along
   with indirect export and direct access) to facilitate complex
   interactions among Clients and Components according to the
   requirements imposed by the application and the deployment of
   Components in the network.

3.4.  Integrating Measurement Tools into mPlane

   mPlane's flexibility and the self-description of measurements
   provided by the Capability-Specification-Result cycle was designed to
   allow a wide variety of existing measurement tools, both probes and
   repositories, to be integrated into an mPlane domain.  In both cases,
   the key to integration is to define a Capability for each of the
   measurements the tool can perform or the queries the repository needs
   to make available within an mPlane domain.  Each Capability has a set
   of parameters - information required to run the measurement or the
   query - and a set of result columns - information which the
   measurement or query returns.

   The parameters and result columns make up the measurement's schema,
   and are chosen from an extensible registry of elements.  Practical
   details are given in Section 4.5.

3.5.  From Architecture to Protocol Specification

   The remainder of this document builds the protocol Specification
   based on this architecture from the bottom up.  First, we define the
   protocol's information model from the element registry through the
   types of mPlane messages and the sections they are composed of.  We
   then define a concrete representation of this information model using
   Javascript Object Notation (JSON, [RFC7159]), and define bindings to
   WebSockets [RFC6455]} over TLS as a session protocol.

4.  Protocol Information Model

   The mPlane protocol is message-oriented, built on the representation-
   and session-protocol-independent exchange of messages between Clients
   and Components.  This section describes the information model,
   starting from the element registry which defines the elements from
   which Capabilities can be built, then detailing each type of message,
   and the sections that make these messages up.  It then provides
   advice on using the information model to model measurements and
   queries.

4.1.  Element Registry

   An element registry makes up the vocabulary by which mPlane
   Components and Clients can express the meaning of parameters,
   metadata, and result columns for mPlane statements.  A registry is
   represented as a JSON [RFC7159] object with the following keys:

   o  registry-format: currently "mplane-0", determines the supported
      features of the registry format.

   o  registry-uri: the URI identifying the registry.  The URI must be
      dereferencable to retrieve the canonical version of this registry.

   o  registry-revision: a serial number starting with 0 and incremented
      with each revision to the content of the registry.

   o  includes: a list of URLs to retrieve additional registries from.
      Included registries will be evaluated in depth-first order, and
      elements with identical names will be replaced by registries
      parsed later.

   o  elements: a list of objects, each of which has the following three
      keys:

      *  name: The name of the element.

   o  prim: The name of the primitive type of the element, from the list
      of primitives in Section 4.1.2.

      *  desc: An English-language description of the meaning of the
         element.

   Since the element names will be used as keys in mPlane messages,
   mPlane binds to JSON, and JSON mandates lowercase key names, element
   names must use only lowercase letters.

   An example registry with two elements and no includes follows:














Trammell & Kuehlewind    Expires April 30, 2017                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft               mPlane Protocol                October 2016


   { "registry-format": "mplane-0",
     "registry-uri", "https://example.com/mplane/registry/core",
     "registry-revision": 0,
     "includes": [],
     "elements": [
         { "name": "full.structured.name",
           "prim": "string",
           "desc": "A representation of foo..."
         },
         { "name": "another.structured.name",
           "prim": "string",
           "desc": "A representation of bar..."
         },
     ]
   }

   Fully qualified element names consist of the element's name as an
   anchor after the URI from which the element came, e.g.
   "https://example.com/mplane/registry/core#full.structured.name".
   Elements within the type registry are considered globally equal based
   on their fully qualified names.  However, within a given mPlane
   message, elements are considered equal based on unqualified names.

4.1.1.  Structured Element Names

   To ease understanding of mPlane type registries, element names are
   structured by convention; that is, an element name is made up of the
   following structural parts in order, separated by the dot ('.')
   character:

   o  basename: exactly one, the name of the property the element
      specifies or measures.  All elements with the same basename
      describe the same basic property.  For example, all elements with
      basename '"source"' relate to the source of a packet, flow, active
      measurement, etc.; and elements with basename '"delay"'' relate to
      the measured delay of an operation.

   o  modifier: zero or more, additional information differentiating
      elements with the same basename from each other.  Modifiers may
      associate the element with a protocol layer, or a particular
      variety of the property named in the basename.  All elements with
      the same basename and modifiers refer to exactly the same
      property.  Examples for the "delay" basename include "oneway" and
      "twoway", differentiating whether a delay refers to the path from
      the source to the destination or from the source to the source via
      the destination; and "icmp" and "tcp", describing the protocol
      used to measure the delay.

Internet-Draft               mPlane Protocol                October 2016


   o  units: zero or one, present if the quantity can be measured in
      different units.

   o  aggregation: zero or one, if the property is a metric derived from
      multiple singleton measurements.  Supported aggregations are:

      *  "min": minimum value

      *  "max": maximum value

      *  "mean": mean value

      *  "sum": sum of values

      *  "NNpct" (where NN is a two-digit number 01-99): percentile

      *  "median": shorthand for and equivalent to "50pct".

      *  "count": count of values aggregated

   When mapping mPlane structured names into contexts in which dots have
   special meaning (e.g.  SQL column names or variable names in many
   programming languages), the dots may be replaced by underscores
   ('_').  When using external type registries (e.g. the IPFIX
   Information Element Registry), element names are not necessarily
   structured.

4.1.2.  Primitive Types

   The mPlane protocol supports the following primitive types for
   elements in the type registry:

   o  string: a sequence of Unicode characters

   o  natural: an unsigned integer

   o  real: a real (floating-point) number

   o  bool: a true or false (boolean) value

   o  time: a timestamp, expressed in terms of UTC.  The precision of
      the timestamp is taken to be unambiguous based on its
      representation.

   o  address: an identifier of a network-level entity, including an
      address family.  The address family is presumed to be implicit in
      the format of the message, or explicitly stored.  Addresses may
      represent specific endpoints or entire networks.

Internet-Draft               mPlane Protocol                October 2016


   o  url: a uniform resource locator

   o  object: a structured object, serialized according to the
      serialization rules of the underlying representation.

4.1.3.  Augmented Registry Information

   Additional keys beyond prim, desc, and name may appear in an mPlane
   registry to augment information about each element.  The following
   additional registry keys have been found useful by some implementors
   of the protocol:

   o  units: If applicable, string describing the units in which the
      element is expressed; equal to the units part of a structured name
      if present.

   o  ipfix-eid: The element ID of the equivalent IPFIX [RFC7011]
      Information Element.

   o  ipfix-pen: The SMI Private Enterprise Number of the equivalent
      IPFIX [RFC7011] Information Element, if any.

4.2.  Message Types

   Workflows in mPlane are built around the Capability - Specification -
   Result cycle.  Capabilities, Specifications, and Results are kinds of
   statements: a Capability is a statement that a Component can perform
   some action (generally a measurement); a Specification is a statement
   that a Client would like a Component to perform the action advertised
   in a Capability; and a Result is a statement that a Component
   measured a given set of values at a given point in time according to
   a Specification.

   Other types of messages outside this nominal cycle are referred to as
   notifications.  Types of notifications include Withdrawals,
   Interrupts, Receipts, Redemptions, and Exceptions.  These notify
   Clients or Components of conditions within the measurement
   infrastructure itself, as opposed to directly containing information
   about measurements or observations.

   Messages may also be grouped together into a single envelope message.
   Envelopes allow multiple messages to be represented within a single
   message, for example multiple Results pertaining to the same Receipt;
   and multiple Capabilities or Specifications to be transferred in a
   single transaction in the underlying session protocol.

   The following types of messages are supported by the mPlane protocol:

Internet-Draft               mPlane Protocol                October 2016


4.2.1.  Capability and Withdrawal

   A Capability is a statement of a Component's ability and willingness
   to perform a specific operation, conveyed from a Component to a
   Client.  It does not represent a guarantee that the specific
   operation can or will be performed at a specific point in time.

   A withdrawal is a notification of a Component's inability or
   unwillingness to perform a specific operation.  It cancels a
   previously advertised Capability.  A withdrawal can also be sent in
   reply to a Specification which attempts to invoke a Capability no
   longer offered.

4.2.2.  Specification and Interrupt

   A Specification is a statement that a Component should perform a
   specific operation, conveyed from a Client to a Component.  It can be
   conceptually viewed as a Capability whose parameters have been filled
   in with values.

   An interrupt is a notification that a Component should stop
   performing a specific operation, conveyed from Client to Component.
   It terminates a previously sent Specification.  If the Specification
   uses indirect export, the indirect export will simply stop running.
   If the Specification has pending Results, those Results are returned
   in response to the interrupt.

4.2.3.  Result

   A Result is a statement produced by a Component that a particular
   measurement was taken and the given values were observed, or that a
   particular operation or analysis was performed and a the given values
   were produced.  It can be conceptually viewed as a Specification
   whose Result columns have been filled in with values.  Note that, in
   keeping with the stateless nature of the mPlane protocol, a Result
   contains the full set of parameters from which it was derived.

   Note that not every Specification will lead to a Result being
   returned; for example, in case of indirect export, only a receipt
   which can be used for future interruption will be returned, as the
   results will be conveyed to a third Component using an external
   protocol.

4.2.4.  Receipt and Redemption

   A receipt is returned instead of a Result by a Component in response
   to a Specification which either:




Trammell & Kuehlewind    Expires April 30, 2017                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft               mPlane Protocol                October 2016


   o  will never return results, as it initiated an indirect export, or

   o  will not return results immediately, as the operation producing
      the results will have a long run time.

   Receipts have the same content Specification they are returned for.
   A Component may optionally add a token section, which can be used in
   future redemptions or interruptions by the Client.  The content of
   the token is an opaque string generated by the Component.

   A redemption is sent from a Client to a Component for a previously
   received receipt to attempt to retrieve delayed results.  It may
   contain only the token section, the token and temporal scope, or all
   sections of the received receipt.

   When the temporal scope of a redemption for a running measurement is
   different than the temporal scope of the original Specification, it
   is treated by the Component as a partial redemption: all rows
   resulting from the measurement within the specified temporal scope
   are returned as a Result.  Otherwise, a Component responds with a
   Result only when the measurement is complete; otherwise, another
   receipt is returned.

   Note that redemptions are optional: when a Component has a Result
   available for a Client after some period of time, it may send it
   immediately, without waiting for a redemption to retrieve it.

4.2.5.  Exception

   An exception is sent from a Client to a Component or from a Component
   to a Client to signal an exceptional condition within the
   infrastructure itself.  They are not meant to signal exceptional
   conditions within a measurement performed by a Component; see
   Section 6.3 for more.  An exception contains only two sections: an
   optional token referring back to the message to which the exception
   is related (if any), and a message section containing free-form,
   preferably human readable information about the exception.

4.2.6.  Envelope

   An envelope is used to contain other messages.  Message containment
   is necessary in contexts in which multiple mPlane messages must be
   grouped into a single transaction in the underlying session protocol.
   It is legal to group any kind of message, and to mix messages of
   different types, in an envelope.  However, in the current revision of
   the protocol, envelopes are primarily intended to be used for three
   distinct purposes:

   o  To group multiple Capabilities together within a single message
      (e.g., all the Capabilities a given Component has).

   o  To return multiple Results for a single receipt or Specification.

   o  To group multiple Specifications into a single message.

4.3.  Message Sections

   Each message is made up of sections, as described in the subsection
   below.  The following table shows the presence of each of these
   sections in each of the message types supported by mPlane: "req"
   means the section is required, "opt" means it is optional, and "tok"
   means it may be replaced by reference via a token when available
   (i.e., in withdrawals and redemptions); see the subsection on each
   message section for details.

              Table 1: Message Sections for Each Message Type

   Withdrawals take the same sections as Capabilities; and redemptions
   and interrupts take the same sections as receipts.  Exceptions are
   not shown in this table.

4.3.1.  Message Type and Verb

   The verb is the action to be performed by the Component.  The
   following verbs are supported by the base mPlane protocol, but
   arbitrary verbs may be specified by applications:

   o  "measure": Perform a measurement

   o  "query": Query a database about a past measurement




Trammell & Kuehlewind    Expires April 30, 2017                [Page 19]

Internet-Draft               mPlane Protocol                October 2016


   o  "collect": Receive Results via indirect export

   o  "callback": Used for callback control in Component-initiated
      workflows

   In the JSON representation of mPlane messages, the verb is the value
   of the key corresponding to the message's type, represented as a
   lowercase string (e.g.  "Capability", "Specification", "result" and
   so on).

   Roughly speaking, probes implement "measure" Capabilities, and
   repositories implement "query" and "collect" Capabilities.  Of
   course, any single Component can implement Capabilities with any
   number of different verbs.

   Within the SDK, the primary difference between "measure" and "query"
   is that the temporal scope of a "measure" Specification is taken to
   refer to when the measurement should be scheduled, while the temporal
   scope of a "query" Specification is taken to refer to the time window
   (in the past) of a query.

   Envelopes have no verb; instead, the value of the "envelope" key is
   the kind of messages the envelope contains, or "message" if the
   envelope contains a mixture of different unspecified kinds of
   messages.

4.3.2.  Version

   The "version" section contains the version of the mPlane protocol to
   which the message conforms, as an integer serially incremented with
   each new protocol revision.  This section is required in all
   messages.  This document describes version 2 of the protocol.

4.3.3.  Registry

   The "registry" section contains the URL identifying the element
   registry used by this message, and from which the registry can be
   retrieved.  This section is required in all messages containing
   element names (statements, and receipts/redemptions/interrupts not
   using tokens for identification; see the "token" section).

4.3.4.  Label

   The "label" section of a statement contains a human-readable label
   identifying it, intended solely for use when displaying information
   about messages in user interfaces.  Results, receipts, redemptions,
   and interrupts inherit their label from the Specification from which
   they follow; otherwise, Client and Component software can arbitrarily

   assign labels . The use of labels is optional in all messages, but as
   labels do greatly ease human-readability of arbitrary messages within
   user interfaces, their use is recommended.

   mPlane Clients and Components should never use the label as a unique
   identifier for a message, or assume any semantic meaning in the label
   - the test of message equality and relatedness is always based upon
   the schema and values as in Section 4.4.

4.3.5.  Temporal Scope (When)

   The "when" section of a statement contains its temporal scope.

   A temporal scope refers to when a measurement can be run (in a
   Capability), when it should be run (in a Specification), or when it
   was run (in a Result).  Temporal scopes can be either absolute or
   relative, and may have an optional period, referring to how often
   single measurements should be taken.

   The general form of a temporal scope (in BNF-like syntax) is as
   follows:

   when = <singleton> |                # A single point in time
              <range> |                # A range in time
            <range> ' / ' <duration>   # A range with a period

   singleton = <iso8601> | # absolute singleton
               'now'       # relative singleton

   range = <iso8601> ' ... ' <iso8601> | # absolute range
           <iso8601> ' + ' <duration> |  # relative range
           'now' ' ... ' <iso8061> |     # definite future
           'now' ' + ' <duration> |      # relative future
           <iso8601> ' ... ' 'now' |     # definite past
           'past ... now' |              # indefinite past
           'now ... future' |            # indefinite future
           <iso8601> ' ... ' 'future' |  # absolute indefinite future
           'past ... future' |           # forever

   duration = [ <n> 'd' ] # days
              [ <n> 'h' ] # hours
              [ <n> 'm' ] # minute
              [ <n> 's' ] # seconds

   iso8601 = <n> '-' <n> '-' <n> [' ' <n> ':' <n> ':' <n> [ '.' <n> ]]

   All absolute times are always given in UTC and expressed in ISO8601
   format with variable precision.

   In Capabilities, if a period is given it represents the minimum
   period supported by the measurement; this is done to allow rate
   limiting.  If no period is given, the measurement is not periodic.  A
   Capability with a period can only be fulfilled by a Specification
   with period greater than or equal to the period in the Capability.
   Conversely, a Capability without a period can only be fulfilled by a
   Specification without a period.

   Within a Result, only absolute ranges are allowed within the temporal
   scope, and refers to the time range of the measurements contributing
   to the Result.  Note that the use of absolute times here implies that
   the Components and Clients within a domain should have relatively
   well-synchronized clocks, e.g., to be synchronized using the Network
   Time Protocol [RFC5905] in order for Results to be temporally
   meaningful.

   So, for example, an absolute range in time might be expressed as:

   "when: 2009-02-20 13:02:15 ... 2014-04-04 04:27:19"

   A relative range covering three and a half days might be:

   "when: 2009-04-04 04:00:00 + 3d12h"

   In a Specification for running an immediate measurement for three
   hours every seven and a half minutes:

   "when: now + 3h / 7m30s"

   In a Capability noting that a Repository can answer questions about
   the past:

   "when: past ... now".

   In a Specification requesting that a measurement run from a specified
   point in time until interrupted:

   "when: 2017-11-23 18:30:00 ... future"

4.3.6.  Parameters

   The "parameters" section of a message contains an ordered list of the
   parameters for a given measurement: values which must be provided by
   a Client to a Component in a Specification to convey the specifics of
   the measurement to perform.  Each parameter in an mPlane message is a
   key-value pair, where the key is the name of an element from the
   element registry.  In Specifications and Results, the value is the
   value of the parameter.  In Capabilities, the value is a constraint



Trammell & Kuehlewind    Expires April 30, 2017                [Page 22]

Internet-Draft               mPlane Protocol                October 2016


   on the possible values the Component will accept for the parameter in
   a subsequent Specification.

   Four kinds of constraints are currently supported for mPlane
   parameters:

   o  No constraint: all values are allowed.  This is signified by the
      special constraint string '"*"'.

   o  Single value constraint: only a single value is allowed.  This is
      intended for use for Capabilities which are conceivably
      configurable, but for which a given Component only supports a
      single value for a given parameter due to its own out-of-band
      configuration or the permissions of the Client for which the
      Capability is valid.  For example, the source address of an active
      measurement of a single-homed probe might be given as
      '"source.ip4: 192.0.2.19"'.

   o  Set constraint: multiple values are allowed, and are explicitly
      listed, separated by the '","' character.  For example, a multi-
      homed probe allowing two potential source addresses on two
      different networks might be given as '"source.ip4: 192.0.2.19,
      192.0.3.21"'.

   o  Range constraint: multiple values are allowed, between two ordered
      values, separated by the special string '"..."'.  Range
      constraints are inclusive.  A measurement allowing a restricted
      range of source ports might be expressed as '"source.port: 32768
      ... 65535"'

   o  Prefix constraint: multiple values are allowed within a single
      network, as specified by a network address and a prefix.  A prefix
      constraint may be satisfied by any network of host address
      completely contained within the prefix.  An example allowing
      probing of any host within a given /24 might be '"destination.ip4:
      192.0.2.0/24"'.

   Parameter and constraint values must be a representation of an
   instance of the primitive type of the associated element.

4.3.7.  Metadata

   The "metadata" section contains measurement metadata: key-value pairs
   associated with a Capability inherited by its Specification and
   Results.  Metadata can also be thought of as immutable parameters.
   This is intended to represent information which can be used to make
   decisions at the Client as to the applicability of a given Capability
   (e.g. details of algorithms used or implementation-specific



Trammell & Kuehlewind    Expires April 30, 2017                [Page 23]

Internet-Draft               mPlane Protocol                October 2016


   information) as well as to make adjustments at post-measurement
   analysis time when contained within Results.

   An example metadata element might be '"measurement.identifier: qof"',
   which identifies the underlying tool taking measurements, such that
   later analysis can correct for known peculiarities in the
   implementation of the tool.  Another example might be
   '"location.longitude = 8.55272"', which while not particularly useful
   for analysis purposes, can be used to draw maps of measurements.

4.3.8.  Result Columns and Values

   Results are represented using two sections: "results" which identify
   the elements to be returned by the measurement, and "resultvalues"
   which contains the actual values. "results" appear in all statements,
   while "resultvalues" appear only in Result messages.

   The "results" section contains an ordered list of result columns for
   a given measurement: names of elements which will be returned by the
   measurement.  The result columns are identified by the names of the
   elements from the element registry.

   The "resultvalues" section contains an ordered list of ordered lists
   (or, rather, a two dimensional array) of values of results for a
   given measurement, in row-major order.  The columns in the result
   values appear in the same order as the columns in the "results"
   section.

   Values for each column must be a representation of an instance of the
   primitive type of the associated result column element.

4.3.9.  Export

   The "export" section contains a URL or partial URL for indirect
   export.  Its meaning depends on the kind and verb of the message:

   o  For Capabilities with the "collect" verb, the "export" section
      contains the URL of the collector which can accept indirect export
      for the schema defined by the "parameters" and "results" sections
      of the Capability, using the protocol identified by the URL's
      schema.

   o  For Capabilities with any verb other than "collect", the "export"
      section contains either the URL of a collector to which the
      Component can indirectly export results, or a URL schema
      identifying a protocol over which the Component can export to
      arbitrary collectors.

Internet-Draft               mPlane Protocol                October 2016


   o  For Specifications with any verb other than "collect", the
      "export" section contains the URL of a collector to which the
      Component should indirectly export results.  A receipt will be
      returned for such Specifications.

   If a Component can indirectly export or indirectly collect using
   multiple protocols, each of those protocols must be identified by its
   own Capability; Capabilities with an "export" section can only be
   used by Specifications with a matching "export" section.

4.3.10.  Link

   The "link" section contains the URL to which messages in the next
   step in the workflow (i.e. a Specification for a Capability, a Result
   or receipt for a Specification) can be sent, providing indirection.
   The link URL must currently have the schema "wss", and refers to the
   URL to which to initiate a connection.

   If present in a Capability, the Client must send Specifications for
   the given Capability to the Component at the URL given in order to
   use the Capability, connecting to the URL if no connection is
   currently established.  If present in a Specification, the Component
   must send Results for the given Specification back to the Client at
   the URL given, connecting to the URL if no connection is currently
   established.

4.3.11.  Token

   The "token" section contains an arbitrary string by which a message
   may be identified in subsequent communications in an abbreviated
   fashion.  Unlike labels, tokens are not necessarily intended to be
   human-readable; instead, they provide a way to reduce redundancy on
   the wire by replacing the parameters, metadata, and results sections
   in messages within a workflow, at the expense of requiring more state
   at Clients and Components.  Their use is optional.

   Tokens are scoped to the association between the Component and Client
   in which they are first created; i.e., at a Component, the token will
   be associated with the Client's identity, and vice-versa at a Client.
   Tokens should be created with sufficient entropy to avoid collision
   from independent processes at the same Client or token reuse in the
   case of Client or Component state loss at restart.

   If a Capability contains a token, it may be subsequently withdrawn by
   the same Component using a withdrawal containing the token instead of
   the parameters, metadata, and results sections.

Internet-Draft               mPlane Protocol                October 2016


   If a Specification contains a token, it may be answered by the
   Component with a receipt containing the token instead of the
   parameters, metadata, and results sections.  A Specification
   containing a token may likewise be interrupted by the Client with an
   interrupt containing the token.  A Component must not answer a
   Specification with a token with a receipt or Result containing a
   different token, but the token may be omitted in subsequent receipts
   and Results.

   If a receipt contains a token, it may be redeemed by the same Client
   using a redemption containing the token instead of the parameters,
   metadata, and results sections.

4.3.12.  Contents

   The "contents" section appears only in envelopes, and is an ordered
   list of messages.  If the envelope's kind identifies a message kind,
   the contents may contain only messages of the specified kind,
   otherwise if the kind is "message", the contents may contain a mix of
   any kind of message.

4.4.  Message Uniqueness and Idempotence

   Messages in the mPlane protocol are intended to support state
   distribution: Capabilities, Specifications, and Results are meant to
   be complete declarations of the state of a given measurement.  In
   order for this to hold, it must be possible for messages to be
   uniquely identifiable, such that duplicate messages can be
   recognized.  With one important exception (i.e., Specifications with
   relative temporal scopes), messages are idempotent: the receipt of a
   duplicate message at a Client or Component is a null operation.

4.4.1.  Message Schema

   The combination of elements in the "parameters" and "results"
   sections, together with the registry from which these elements are
   drawn, is referred to as a message's schema.  The schema of a
   measurement can be loosely thought of as the definition of the table,
   rows of which the message represents.

   The schema contributes not only to the identity of a message, but
   also to the semantic interpretation of the parameter and result
   values.  The meanings of element values in mPlane are dependent on
   the other elements present in the message; in other words, the key to
   interpreting an mPlane message is that the unit of semantic identity
   is a message.  For example, the element '"destination.ip4"' as a
   parameter means "the target of a given active measurement" when
   together with elements describing an active metric (e.g.



Trammell & Kuehlewind    Expires April 30, 2017                [Page 26]

Internet-Draft               mPlane Protocol                October 2016


   '"delay.twoway.icmp.us"'), but "the destination of the packets in a
   flow" when together with other elements in result columns describing
   a passively-observed flow.

   The interpretation of the semantics of an entire message is
   application-specific.  The protocol does not forbid the transmission
   of messages representing semantically meaningless or ambiguous
   schemas.

4.4.2.  Message Identity

   A message's identity is composed of its schema, together with its
   temporal scope, metadata, parameter values, and indirect export
   properties.  Concretely, the full content of the "registry", "when",
   "parameters", "metadata", "results", and "export" sections taken
   together comprise the message's identity.

   One convenience feature complicates this somewhat: when the temporal
   scope is not absolute, multiple Specifications may have the same
   literal temporal scope but refer to different measurements.  In this
   case, the current time at the Client or Component when a message is
   invoked must be taken as part of the message's identity as well.
   Implementations may use hashes over the values of the message's
   identity sections to uniquely identify messages; e.g. to generate
   message tokens.

4.5.  Designing Measurement and Repository Schemas

   As noted, the key to integrating a measurement tool into an mPlane
   infrastructure is properly defining the schemas for the measurements
   and queries it performs, then defining those schemas in terms of
   mPlane Capabilities.  Specifications and Results follow naturally
   from Capabilities, and the mPlane SDK allows Python methods to be
   bound to Capabilities in order to execute them.  A schema should be
   defined such that the set of parameters, the set of result columns,
   and the verb together naturally and uniquely define the measurement
   or the query being performed.  For simple metrics, this is achieved
   by encoding the entire meaning of the metric in its name.  For
   example, "delay.twoway.icmp.us" as a result column together with
   "source.ip4" and "destination.ip4" as parameters uniquely defines a
   single ping measurement, measured via ICMP, expressed in
   microseconds.

   Aggregate measurements are defined by returning metrics with
   aggregations: "delay.twoway.icmp.min.us", "delay.twoway.icmp.max.us",
   "delay.twoway.icmp.mean.us", and "delay.twoway.icmp.count.us" as
   result columns represent aggregate ping measurements with multiple
   samples.



Trammell & Kuehlewind    Expires April 30, 2017                [Page 27]

Internet-Draft               mPlane Protocol                October 2016


   Note that mPlane Results may contain multiple rows.  In this case,
   the parameter values in the Result, taken from the Specification,
   apply to all rows.  In this case, the rows are generally
   differentiated by the values in one or more result columns; for
   example, the "time" element can be used to represent time series, or
   the "hops.ip" different elements along a path between source and
   destination, as in a traceroute measurement.

   For measurements taken instantaneously, the verb "measure" should be
   used; for direct queries from repositories, the verb "query" should
   be used.  Other actions that cannot be differentiated by schema alone
   should be differentiated by a custom verb.

   When integrating a repository into an mPlane infrastructure, only a
   subset of the queries the repository can perform will generally be
   exposed via the mPlane interface.  Consider a generic repository
   which provides an SQL interface for querying data; wrapping the
   entire set of possible queries in specific Capabilities would be
   impossible, while providing direct access to the underlying SQL (for
   instance, by creating a custom registry with a "query.sql" string
   element to be used as a parameter) would make it impossible to
   differentiate Capabilities by schema (thereby making the
   interoperability benefits of mPlane integration pointless).  Instead,
   specific queries to be used by Clients in concert with Capabilities
   provided by other Components are each wrapped within a separate
   Capability, analogous to stored procedure programming in many
   database engines.  Of course, Clients which do speak the precise
   dialect of SQL necessary can integrate directly with the repository
   separate from the Capabilities provided over mPlane.

5.  Representations and Session Protocols

   The mPlane protocol is built atop an abstract data model in order to
   support multiple representations and session protocols.  The
   canonical representation supported by the present SDK involves JSON
   [RFC7159] objects transported via Websockets [RFC6455] over TLS
   [RFC5246] (known by the "wss" URL schema).

5.1.  JSON representation

   In the JSON representation, an mPlane message is a JSON object,
   mapping sections by name to their contents.  The name of the message
   type is a special section key, which maps to the message's verb, or
   to the message's content type in the case of an envelope.

   Each section name key in the object has a value represented in JSON
   as follows:

   o  "version" : an integer identifying the mPlane protocol version
      used by the message.

   o  "registry" : a URL identifying the registry from which element
      names are taken.

   o  "label" : an arbitrary string.

   o  "when" : a string containing a temporal scope, as described in
      Section 4.3.5.

   o  "parameters" : a JSON object mapping (non-qualified) element
      names, either to constraints or to parameter values, as
      appropriate, and as described in Section 4.3.6.

   o  "metadata" : a JSON object mapping (non-qualified) element names
      to metadata values.

   o  "results" : an array of element names.

   o  "resultvalues" : an array of arrays of element values in row major
      order, where each row array contains values in the same order as
      the element names in the "results" section.

   o  "export" : a URL for indirect export.

   o  "link" : a URL for message indirection.

   o  "token" : an arbitrary string.

   o  "contents" : an array of objects containing messages.

5.1.1.  Textual representations of element values

   Each primitive type is represented as a value in JSON as follows,
   following the Textual Representation of IPFIX Abstract Data Types
   defined in [RFC7373].

   Natural and real values are represented in JSON using native JSON
   representation for numbers.

   Booleans are represented by the reserved words "true" and "false".

   Strings and URLs are represented as JSON strings, subject to JSON
   escaping rules.

   Addresses are represented as dotted quads for IPv4 addresses as they
   would be in URLs, and canonical IPv6 textual addresses as in section



Trammell & Kuehlewind    Expires April 30, 2017                [Page 29]

Internet-Draft               mPlane Protocol                October 2016


   2.2 of [RFC4291] as updated by section 4 of [RFC5952].  When
   representing networks, addresses may be suffixed as in CIDR notation,
   with a '"/"' character followed by the mask length in bits n,
   provided that the least significant 32 - n or 128 - n bits of the
   address are zero, for IPv4 and IPv6 respectively.

   Timestamps are represented in [RFC3339] and ISO 8601, with two
   important differences.  First, all mPlane timestamps are are
   expressed in terms of UTC, so time zone offsets are neither required
   nor supported, and are always taken to be 0.  Second, fractional
   seconds are represented with a variable number of digits after an
   optional decimal point after the fraction.

   Objects are represented as JSON objects.

5.1.2.  Example mPlane Capabilities and Specifications in JSON

   To illustrate how mPlane messages are encoded, we consider first two
   Capabilities for a very simple application - ping - as mPlane JSON
   Capabilities.  The following Capability states that the Component can
   measure ICMP two-way delay from 192.0.2.19 to anywhere on the IPv4
   Internet, with a minimum delay between individual pings of 1 second,
   returning aggregate statistics:

   {
     "capability": "measure",
     "version":    0,
     "registry":   "https://example.com/mplane/registry/core",
     "label":      "ping-aggregate",
     "when":       "now ... future / 1s",
     "parameters": {"source.ip4":      "192.0.2.19",
                    "destination.ip4": "*"},
     "results":    ["delay.twoway.icmp.us.min",
                    "delay.twoway.icmp.us.mean",
                    "delay.twoway.icmp.us.50pct",
                    "delay.twoway.icmp.us.max",
                    "delay.twoway.icmp.count"]
   }

   In contrast, the following Capability would return timestamped
   singleton delay measurements given the same parameters:

Internet-Draft               mPlane Protocol                October 2016


   {
     "capability": "measure",
     "version":    0,
     "registry":   "https://example.com/mplane/registry/core",
     "label":      "ping-singletons",
     "when":       "now ... future / 1s",
     "parameters": {"source.ip4":      "192.0.2.19",
                    "destination.ip4": "*"},
     "results":    ["time",
                    "delay.twoway.icmp.us"]
   }

   A Specification is merely a Capability with filled-in parameters,
   e.g.:

   {
     "specification":  "measure",
     "version":        0,
     "registry":       "https://example.com/mplane/registry/core",
     "label":          "ping-aggregate-three-thirtythree",
     "token":          "0f31c9033f8fce0c9be41d4942c276e4",
     "when":           "now + 30s / 1s",
     "parameters": {"source.ip4":      "192.0.2.19",
                    "destination.ip4": "192.0.3.33"},
     "results":    ["delay.twoway.icmp.us.min",
                    "delay.twoway.icmp.us.mean",
                    "delay.twoway.icmp.us.50pct",
                    "delay.twoway.icmp.us.max",
                    "delay.twoway.icmp.count"]
   }

Internet-Draft               mPlane Protocol                October 2016


   Indirect export to a repository with subsequent query requires three
   Capabilities: one in which the repository advertises its ability to
   accept data over a given external protocol, one in which the probe
   advertises its ability to export data of the same type using that
   protocol, and one in which the repository advertises its ability to
   answer queries about the stored data.  Returning to the aggregate
   ping measurement, first let's consider a repository which can accept
   these measurements via direct POST of mPlane Result messages:

   {
     "capability": "collect",
     "version":    0,
     "registry":   "https://example.com/mplane/registry/core",
     "label":      "ping-aggregate-collect",
     "when":       "past ... future",
     "export":     "wss://repository.example.com:4343/",
     "parameters": {"source.ip4":      "*",
                    "destination.ip4": "*"},
     "results":    ["delay.twoway.icmp.us.min",
                    "delay.twoway.icmp.us.mean",
                    "delay.twoway.icmp.us.50pct",
                    "delay.twoway.icmp.us.max",
                    "delay.twoway.icmp.count"]
   }

   This Capability states that the repository at
   "wss://repository.example.com:4343/" will accept mPlane Result
   messages matching the specified schema, without any limitations on
   time.  Note that this schema matches that of the export Capability
   provided by the probe:

   {
     "capability": "measure",
     "version":    0,
     "registry":   "https://example.com/mplane/registry/core",

                    "delay.twoway.icmp.us.mean",
                    "delay.twoway.icmp.us.50pct",
                    "delay.twoway.icmp.us.max",
                    "delay.twoway.icmp.count"]
   }

   which differs only from the previous probe Capability in that it
   states that Results can be exported via the "wss" protocol.
   Subsequent queries can be sent to the repository in response to the
   query Capability:

   {
     "capability": "query",
     "version":    0,
     "registry":   "https://example.com/mplane/registry/core",

     "link":       "wss://repo.example.com:4343/",
     "parameters": {"source.ip4":      "*",
                    "destination.ip4": "*"},
     "results":    ["delay.twoway.icmp.us.min",
                    "delay.twoway.icmp.us.mean",
                    "delay.twoway.icmp.us.50pct",

5.2.  mPlane over WebSockets over TLS

   The default session protocol for mPlane is WebSockets [RFC6455].
   Once a WebSockets handshake between Client and Component is complete,
   messages are simply exchanged as outlined in Section 4.2 as JSON
   objects in WebSockets text frames over the channel.

   When WebSockets is used as a session protocol for mPlane, it MUST be
   used over TLS for mPlane message exchanges.  Both TLS Clients and
   servers MUST present certificates for TLS mutual authentication.
   mPlane Components MUST use the certificate presented by the mPlane
   Client to determine the Client's identity, and therefore the
   Capabilities which it is authorized to invoke. mPlane Clients MUST
   use the certificate presented by the mPlane Component to authenticate
   the Results received. mPlane Clients and Components MUST NOT use
   network-layer address or name (e.g. derived from DNS PTR queries)
   information to identify peers.

Internet-Draft               mPlane Protocol                October 2016


   mPlane Components may either act as WebSockets servers, for Client-
   initiated connection establishment, or as WebSockets Clients, for
   Component-initiated connection establishment.  In either case, it is
   the responsibility of the connection initiator to re-establish
   connection in case it is lost.  In this case, the entity acting as
   WebSockets server SHOULD maintain a queue of pending mPlane messages
   to identified peers to be sent on reconnection.

5.2.1.  mPlane PKI for WebSockets

   The Clients and Components within an mPlane domain generally share a
   single certificate issuer, specific to a single mPlane domain.
   Issuing a certificate to a Client or Component then grants it
   membership within the domain.  Any Client or Component within the
   domain can then communicate with Components and Clients within that
   domain.  In a domain containing one or more supervisors, all Clients
   and Components within the domain can connect to a supervisor.  This
   deployment pattern can be used to scale mPlane domains to large
   numbers of Clients and Components without needing to specifically
   configure each Client and Component identity at the supervisor.

   In the case of interdomain federation, where supervisors connect to
   each other, each supervisor will have its own issuer.  In this case,
   each supervisor must be configured to trust each remote domain's
   issuer, but only to identify that domain's supervisor.  This
   compartmentalization is necessary to keep one domain from authorizing
   Clients within another domain.

5.2.2.  Capability Advertisement for WebSockets

   When a connection is first established between a Client and a
   Component, regardless of whether the Client or the Component
   initiates the connection, the Component sends an envelope containing
   all the Capabilities it wishes to advertise to the Client, based on
   the Client's identity.

5.2.3.  mPlane Link and Export URLs for WebSockets

   Components acting as WebSockets servers (for Client-initiated
   connection establishment) are identified in the Link sections of
   Capabilities and receipts by URLs with the "wss:" schema.  Similarly,
   Clients acting as WebSockets servers (for Component-initated
   connection establishment) are identified in the Link sections of
   Specifications by URLs with the "wss:" schema.

   When the "wss:" schema appears in the export section of the
   Capability, this represents the Component's willingness to establish
   a WebSockets connection over which mPlane Result messages will be

Internet-Draft               mPlane Protocol                October 2016


   pushed.  A "wss:" schema URL in a Specification export section,
   similarly, directs the Component to the WebSockets server to push
   Results to.

   Path information in WebSockets URLs is presently unused by the mPlane
   protocol, but path information MUST be conserved. mPlane Clients and
   Components acting as WebSockets servers can use path information as
   they see fit, for example to separate Client and Component workflows
   on the same server (as on a supervisor), to run mPlane and other
   protocols over WebSockets on the same server, and/or to pass
   cryptographic tokens for additional context separation or
   authorization purposes.  Future versions of the mPlane protocol may
   use path information in WebSockets URLs, but this path information
   will be relative to this conserved "base" URL, as opposed to relative
   to the root.

6.  Deployment Considerations

   This section outlines considerations for building larger-scale
   infrastructures from the building blocks defined in this document.

6.1.  Supervisors and Federation

   For simple infrastructures, a set of Components may be controlled
   directly by a Client.  However, in more complex infrastructures
   providing support for multiple Clients, a supervisor can mediate
   between Clients and Components.  This supervisor is responsible for
   collecting Capabilities from a set of Components, and providing
   Capabilities based on these to its Clients.  From the point of view
   of the mPlane protocol, a supervisor is merely a combined Component
   and Client.  The logic binding Client and Component interfaces within
   the supervisor is application-specific, as it involves the following
   operations according to the semantics of each application:

   o  translating lower-level Capabilities from subordinate Components
      into higher-level (composed) Capabilities, according to the
      application's semantics

   o  translating higher-level Specifications from subordinate
      Components into lower-level (decomposed) Specifications

   o  relaying or aggregating Results from subordinate Components to
      supervisor Clients

   This arrangement is shown in Figure 3.

          Figure 3: Simple mPlane architecture with a supervisor

   The set of Components which respond to Specifications from a single
   supervisor is referred to as an mPlane domain.  Domain membership is
   also determined by the issuer of the certificates identifying the
   Clients, Components, and supervisor.  Within a given domain, each
   Client and Component connects to only one supervisor.  Underlying
   measurement Components and Clients may indeed participate in multiple
   domains, but these are separate entities from the point of view of
   the architecture.  Interdomain measurement is supported by federation
   among supervisors: a local supervisor delegates measurements in a
   remote domain to that domain's supervisor.

   In addition to Capability composition and Specification
   decomposition, supervisors are responsible for Client and Component
   registration and authentication, as well as access control based on
   identity information provided by the session protocol (WebSockets) in
   the general case.

   The general responsibilities of a supervisor are elaborated in the
   subsections below:

Internet-Draft               mPlane Protocol                October 2016


6.1.1.  Component Registration

   In order to be able to use Components to perform measurements, the
   supervisor must register the Components associated with it.  For
   Client-initiated workflows - large repositories and the address of
   the Components is often a configuration parameter of the supervisor.
   Capabilities describing the available measurements and queries at
   large-scale Components can even be part of the supervisor's
   externally managed static configuration, or can be dynamically
   retrieved and updated from the Components or from a Capability
   discovery server.

   For Component-initiated workflows, Components connect to the
   supervisor and send Capabilities and withdrawals, which requires the
   supervisor to maintain a set of Capabilities associated with a set of
   Components currently part of the mPlane infrastructure it supervises.

6.1.2.  Client Authentication

   For many Components - probes and simple repositories - very simple
   authentication often suffices, such that any Client with a
   certificate with an issuer recognized as valid is acceptable, and all
   Capabilities are available to.  Larger repositories often need finer
   grained control, mapping specific peer certificates to identities
   internal to the repository's access control system (e.g. database
   users).

   In an mPlane infrastructure, it is therefore the supervisor's
   responsibility to map Client identities to the set of Capabilities
   each Client is authorized to access.  This mapping is part of the
   supervisor's configuration.

6.1.3.  Capability Composition and Specification Decomposition

   The most dominant responsibility of the supervisor is composing
   Capabilities from its subordinate Components into aggregate
   Capabilities, and decomposing Specifications from Clients to more-
   specific Specifications to pass to each Component.  This operation is
   always application-specific, as the semantics of the composition and
   decomposition operations depend on the Capabilities available from
   the Components, the granularity of the Capabilities to be provided to
   the Clients.

6.2.  Indirect Export

   Many common measurement infrastructures involve a large number of
   probes exporting large volumes of data to a (much) smaller number of
   repositories, where data is reduced and analyzed.  Since (1) the

Internet-Draft               mPlane Protocol                October 2016


   mPlane protocol is not particularly well-suited to the bulk transfer
   of data and (2) fidelity is better ensured when minimizing
   translations between representations, the channel between the probes
   and the repositories is in this case external to mPlane.  This
   indirect export channel runs either a standard export protocol such
   as IPFIX, or a proprietary protocol unique to the probe/repository
   pair.  It coordinates an exporter which will produce and export data
   with a collector which will receive it.  All that is necessary is
   that (1) the Client, exporter, and collector agree on a schema to
   define the data to be transferred and (2) the exporter and collector
   share a common protocol for export.

   Here, we consider a Client speaking to an exporter and a collector.
   The Client first receives an export Capability from the exporter
   (with verb "measure" and with a protocol identified in the "export"
   section) and a collection Capability from the collector (with the
   verb "collect" and with a URL in the "export" section describing
   where the exporter should export), either via a Client-initiated
   workflow or a Capability discovery server.  The Client then sends a
   Specification to the exporter, which matches the schema and parameter
   constraints of both the export and collection Capabilities, with the
   collector's URL in the "export" section.

   The exporter initiates export to the collector using the specified
   protocol, and replies with a receipt that can be used to interrupt
   the export, should it have an indefinite temporal scope.  In the
   meantime, it sends data matching the Capability's schema directly to
   the collector.

   This data, or data derived from the analysis thereof, can then be
   subsequently retrieved by a Client using a Client-initiated workflow
   to the collector.

6.3.  Error Handling in mPlane Workflows

   Any Component may signal an error to its Client or supervisor at any
   time by sending an exception message.  While the taxonomy of error
   messages is at this time left up to each individual Component, given
   the weakly imperative nature of the mPlane protocol, exceptions
   should be used sparingly, and only to notify Components and Clients
   of errors with the mPlane infrastructure itself.

   It is generally presumed that diagnostic information about errors
   which may require external human intervention to correct will be
   logged at each Component; the mPlane exception facility is not
   intended as a replacement for logging facilities (such as syslog).

Internet-Draft               mPlane Protocol                October 2016


   Specifically, Components using Component-initiated connection
   establishment should not use the exception mechanism for common error
   conditions (e.g., device losing connectivity for small network-edge
   probes) - Specifications sent to such Components are expected to be
   best-effort.  Exceptions should also not be returned for
   Specifications which would normally not be delayed but are due to
   high load - receipts should be used in this case, instead.  Likewise,
   Specifications which cannot be fulfilled because they request the use
   of Capabilities that were once available but are no longer should be
   answered with withdrawals.

   Exceptions should always be sent in reply to messages sent to
   Components or Clients which cannot be handled due to a syntactic or
   semantic error in the message itself.

7.  Security Considerations

   The mPlane protocol allows the control of network measurement
   devices.  The protocol itself uses WebSockets using TLS as a session
   layer.  TLS mutual authentication must be used for the exchange of
   mPlane messages, as access control decisions about which Clients and
   Components are trusted for which Capabilities take identity
   information from the certificates TLS Clients and servers use to
   identify themselves.  Current operational best security practices for
   the deployment of TLS-secured protocols must be followed for the
   deployment of mPlane.

   Indirect export, as a design feature, presents a potential for
   information leakage, as indirectly exported data is necessarily
   related to measurement data and control transported with the mPlane
   protocol.  Though out of scope for this document, indirect export
   protocols used within an mPlane domain must be secured at least as
   well as the mPlane protocol itself.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.  Future versions of this
   document, should it become a standards-track Specification, may
   specify the initial contents of a core mPlane registry to be managed
   by IANA.
