Abstract 
    
   This document discusses the typical network operation use cases of 
   Large Access Providers (LAP).  Since a LAP has hundreds of 
   locations, thousands of nodes, millions of subscribers, where the 
   law of large number affects the bottom line of network operation, a 
   LAP has been always strives to streamline network operation 
   functions.  The use cases presented in this document are generic 
   with respect to the type of network technology and can be augmented 
   with technology-specific details.  They are intended to be the 
   baseline for other network operation streamlining requirements.

1.   Introduction 
 
   Large providers of broadband Internet access are faced with 
   difficult demands that need be alleviated by streamlining network 
   operation.  This document discusses the typical network operation 
   use cases of Large Access Providers (LAP).  Since a LAP has hundreds 
   of locations, thousands of nodes, millions of subscribers, where and 
   the law of large number affects the bottom line of network 
   operation, a LAP has been always strives to streamline network 
   operation functions.  The use cases presented in this document are 
   generic with respect to the type of network technology and can be 
   augmented with technology-specific details.  They are intended to be 
   the baseline for other network operation streamlining requirements.   
    
   A LAP typically has one or a few network management systems (NMSs) 
   deployed to manage its network.  NMSs are located in network 
   operations centers, remote from the network elements (NEs) but 
   connected to them by a Central Office Data Communications Network 
   (CODCN).  While most NEs provide some local means of accessing the 
   device for management purposes (ôcraft interfaceö or "command line 
   interface"), this is usually used only during extraordinary 
   situations, as the cost and time required sending a technician to 
   the NE site is burdensome.  Also it is time consuming and expensive 
   to train a technician to be proficient in many varieties of "craft 
   interface" or "command line interface".  Thus, the NMS is a service 
   provider's primary access for managing network elements. 
    
   This does not mean that all network operation functions will be 
   performed by people sitting in front of a NMS terminal.  To the 
   contrary, streamlining network operation functions requires the NMS 
   to be integrated with a service provider's Operation Support Systems 
   (OSSs).  The NMS must provide electronic protocol interfaces to 
   accomplish this. 
 
   The use cases described here are centered on network management 
   system (NMS). Each use case description indicates the actor(s) 
   involved in the use case.  An actor is a user of the system and may 
   be a human or a machine.  In addition to the behavior described in 
   the use case body, each use case also lists preconditions and post 
   conditions.  Preconditions are statements that must hold true before 
   the system is expected to exhibit the behavior described in the use 
   case.  Post conditions are statements that must hold true at the 
   completion of the use case.

   Administrative State 
      When the administrative state of a network resource entity is 
      "unlocked" by the operator, the entity is allowed to perform its 
      normal functions.  When the administrative state of a network 
      resource entity is "locked" by the operator, the entity is not 
      allowed to perform its normal functions.  When the administrative 
      state of a network resource entity is set to "defective" by the 
      operator, the entity is out of service. 
       
   Operational State 
      When the operational state of a network resource entity is in the 
      enabled state, the entity is operational.  When the operational 
      state of a network resource entity is in the disabled state, the 
      entity is incapable of performing its normal function. 
    
    
3.   Use Cases of General Operation 
    
3.1. Browsing and Clearing of Alarm 
   Actor:  Operator, NE 
   Pre-Conditions:   
      1.   The NE is under EMS management. 
   Descriptions:   
      1.   The operator MUST be able to browse any active alarms and 
        cleared alarms (history alarm) in interactive and bulk methods.  
        The operator MUST be able to force the NMS to re-synchronize 
        its alarm state with a NE. 
      2.   The operator MUST be able to select any alarms in 
        interactive and bulk methods and write them to a text file that 
        can be stored, transferred, etc. 
      3.   The operator MUST be able to select any alarm in interactive 
        and bulk methods and delete them. 
      4.   The operator MUST be able to set a limit on the size of the 
        history alarm log.  The oldest alarm records are dropped from 
        the log to make room for the new records.

      5.   The network resource entity (NE, plug-in, port, link, 
        connection, service, etc.) may send a clearing alarm to clear a 
        previous sent alarm.  The NMS MUST be able to correlate the 
        clearing alarm with the original alarm. 
      6.   The operator may select an alarm and manually clear it.  The 
        reason, note, and the operator's name MUST be logged. 
      7.   The cleared alarm MUST be marked "cleared", removed from the 
        active alarm log, and moved to the history alarm log.  The date 
        and time, the reason of the alarm clearing MUST be logged. 
      8.   Any "descendant" alarms correlated with the cleared alarm 
        MUST be also cleared in the same fashion. 
      9.   The NMS GUI MUST be automatically updated with the new alarm 
        data. 
   Post Conditions:  The alarm and any correlated descendants are 
   marked as cleared and moved from the active alarm log to the history 
   alarm log. 
    
3.2. Alarm of Network Resource Entity 
   Actor:  Operator, NE, OSS 
   Pre-Conditions:   
      1.   The NE is under the NMS management. 
      2.   The network resource entity (e.g. NE, plug-in, port, link, 
        routing and signaling instance, connection, or service) 
        experience a notable event, i.e. an alarm. 
   Descriptions:   
      1.   The NMS MUST be able to receive an alarm regarding a network 
        resource entity (e.g. NE, plug-in, port, link, routing and 
        signaling instance, connection, or service) from the NE 
        reliably. 
      2.   The operator MUST be able to define a default alarm severity 
        assignment profile to be used by the NE and the NMS, and to 
        assign alarm severity (Critical, Major, Minor, Warning) to 
        alarm conditions. 
      3.   The operator MUST be able to define an alarm severity 
        assignment for a specific network resource entity (e.g. NE, 
        plug-in, port, link, routing and signaling instance, 
        connection, or service). 
      4.   The operator MUST be able to set a length of time for a 
        specific network resource entity (e.g. NE, plug-in, port, link, 
        routing and signaling instance, connection, or service) during 
        which alarms on that entity will be suppressed. 
      5.   The operator MUST be able to set a "soak" period for the 
        various alarm conditions.  A soak period defines how long an 
        alarm condition must persist before an alarm is declared. 
      6.   New alarms MUST be added to the active alarm log.  Duplicate 
        alarms SHOULD not be added to the alarm log.  Instead, a count 
        of duplicates MUST be kept for each alarm, along with a record 
        of when the first and last occurrences were received. 
      7.   If the communication channel between an NE and the NMS is 
        down, the NMS MUST re-synchronizes to the alarm state of the NE 
 
 
Chen and Allen             Expire June 2003                   [Page 6] 
Internet Draft     draft-weijing-lap-ops-use-01.txt          Dec. 2002 
 
 
        after the communication channel is up again.  The NMS MUST logs 
        and reports outstanding alarms and cleared alarms missed during 
        an out of synchronization period. 
      8.   Alarms from the same NE MUST be correlated to identify any 
        cause and effect relationships between them.  Therefore alarms 
        are organized into a tree structure, where child alarms 
        represent conditions that are actually a result of the parent 
        alarm.  Alarms at the roots of these trees are the actual alarm 
        conditions.  Repairing the root-cause alarm will fixing its 
        descendent alarms. 
      9.   The received alarm MUST contain the following data: 
          .  Alarm unique ID 
          .  Alarm severity 
          .  Alarm type 
          .  Alarm description 
          .  Alarm date and time 
          .  Alarm source entity (smallest possible unit) 
          .  Alarm ID of the root-cause alarm to which this alarm may 
             have been correlated 
          .  Network technology-specific data 
      10.  The network resource entity (e.g. NE, plug-in, port, link, 
        routing and signaling instance, connection, or service) SHOULD 
        send the alarms on the following cases: 
          .  Reset of network resource entity 
          .  Administrative state change of network resource entity 
          .  Operational state change of network resource entity 
          .  Network technology-specific cases 
      11.  The network resource entity (e.g. NE, plug-in, port, link, 
        routing and signaling instance, connection, or service) may 
        clear a previously sent alarm.  See Use Case 3.1 for more 
        details. 
      12.  The NMS GUI and the protocol interface to the OSS MUST be 
        automatically updated with the new alarm data. 
   Post Conditions:  The active alarm log and the history alarm log are 
   updated accordingly. 
    
3.3. Test of Network Resource Entity 
   Actor:  Operator, NE 
   Pre-Conditions:   
      1.   The NE is under the NMS management. 
   Descriptions:   
      1.   The operator MUST be able to invoke any network resource 
        entity (NE, plug-in, port) test capability from the NMS GUI. 
      2.   The operator SHOULD be able to invoke multiple concurrent 
        tests on the same and different network resource entity (NE, 
        plug-in, port). 
      3.   The operator SHOULD be able to schedule the test at a future 
        time. 
      4.   The operator SHOULD be able to set the source and sink 
        points, the number of iterations, and the iteration interval,

        of continuity (loopback) test, if the network technology 
        supports it. 
      5.   The test result SHOULD be displayed and retrievable through 
        the NMS GUI. 
   Post Conditions:  The test result is available for diagnosing. 
    
3.4. Performance and Usage of Network Resource Entity 
   Actor:  Operator, NE 
   Pre-Conditions:   
      1.   The NE is under the NMS management. 
   Descriptions:   
      1.   The operator MUST be able to specify the following 
        performance and usage data collection parameters: 
          .  Collection interval, typically 15 minutes 
          .  Number of intervals to be collected into a single data 
             file, typically 96 intervals 
          .  Lifetime of the data files in NE 
          .  Network resource entities or types of entities (e.g. NE, 
             plug-in, port, link, routing and signaling instance, 
             connection, or service) from which data is to be collected 
          .  Network technology-specific performance and usage data to 
             be collected 
      2.   The operator MUST be able to set the threshold values for 
        the monitored data attributes. When the data attribute crosses 
        this threshold, a threshold crossing alarm MUST be generated.  
        See Use Case 3.2 for details on alarm processing. The monitored 
        data attributes for threshold crossing are the following: 
          .  Network technology-specific data 
      3.   The operator MUST be able to browse, delete, and transfer 
        the performance and usage data files based on file names and 
        locations (e.g. URL). 
      4.   Any data files whose lifetimes expire before they are 
        deleted by an operator SHOULD be automatically deleted by the 
        NE or the MS. 
   Post Conditions:  Performance and usage data are collected and 
   stored in data files. 
    
    
4.   Use Cases of Network Infrastructure Operation

   Pre-Conditions: 
      1.   A new NE has been installed. 
      2.   The NE is connected to CODCN to which NMS is also connected.  
      3.   The NE has been assigned an IP address through some local 
        means and the IP connectivity between NE and NMS has been 
        established. 
   Descriptions:

      1.   The operator navigates to a GUI screen for adding new NEs to 
        the NMS. 
      2.   The operator enters the IP address assigned to the new NE, 
        and any necessary security key (e.g. user name, password). 
      3.   The operator assigns to the new NE a unique name (which 
        could be a CLLI code). 
      4.   The NMS then MUST automatically synchronize itself with the 
        current configuration of the NE. See Use Case 4.3. 
   Post Conditions:  The NMS is in sync with the NE and the NMS is now 
   managing the NE. 
    
4.2. NE Software Download 
   Actor:  Operator, NE 
   Pre-Conditions:   
      1.   The NE is under the NMS management. 
      2.   The operator has loaded new NE software from a distribution 
        medium onto the NMS. 
   Descriptions:   
      1.   The software download MUST be performed from the NMS GUI and 
        MUST NOT require sending a technician to the NE. 
      2.   The software download MUST be performed without halting the 
        NE.  It SHOULD be done without rebooting the NE and 
        interrupting services. 
      3.   The operator SHOULD be able to download the software 
        immediately or schedule the download for a later time. 
      4.   The operator SHOULD be able to identify a set of NEs to 
        target for the software download. 
      5.   The NMS MUST verify that the software to be downloaded to 
        the NE, or the plug-in, is compatible with the current hardware 
        version of the NE or the plug-in. 
      6.   The NE and NMS MUST verify the download and notify the 
        operator of the success or failure of the download. 
      7.   The operator SHOULD be able to activate the new software

   Descriptions: 
      1.   The NE is the master of "hard" data about itself. The "hard" 
        data is read-only data that cannot be changed by the MS.  This 
        includes, for example, the current alarm and operational state 
        of the resource entity (NE, plug-in, port, etc.), the hardware 
        installed in and software loaded on the NE, performance and 
        usage measurement, etc.  The NMS is responsible for updating 
        itself to match the NE on this data.   
      2.   The NMS is the master of "soft" data about the NE. The 
        "soft" data is writable data that is set by the MS. This 
        includes, for example, configurable parameters such as 
        administrative state of the resource entity (NE, plug-in, port, 
        etc.), whether or not they are assigned, links and connections 
        (circuit, VC, LSP, etc), VPNs, routing and signaling, etc.  The 
        NMS is responsible for updating the NE to match the NMS on this 
        data. 
      3.   If the NE is a new NE, the NMS MUST automatically 
        synchronize with it for the first time. 
      4.   The NMS MUST automatically detects a condition that might 
        have caused it to lose connectivity with the NE.  The NMS MUST 
        automatically synchronize with the NE it has been out of 
        connectivity with.  This includes:  
          .  The NMS has been down and is now active again. 
          .  A NE has been down and is now active again. 
          .  The CODCN between the NMS and NEs has been down and is now 
             active again. 
      5.   Priority SHOULD be placed on re-establishing the ability to 
        synchronize the affected NEs over other management functions. 
      6.   The NMS GUI MUST be automatically updated with the new 
        synchronized data. 
   Post Conditions:  The data in the NMS and the NE accurately reflects 
   the current state of the NE's configuration. 
    
4.4. NE Continuous Synchronization 
   Actor:  NE 
   Pre-Conditions: 
      1.   The state of a NE changes in such a way that data in the NMS 
        may inaccurately reflect the state of the NE configuration. 
   Descriptions: 
      1.   The NE MUST automatically notify the NMS of changes to its 
        hardware, software, links and connections, routing and 
        signaling, and any other physical or logical resource entity 
        stewarded by the NE, especially changes due to technician 
        interaction with the NE through the "craft interface" or 
        "command  line interface".   
      2.   The NE MUST support automatically notifications of 
        installations, removals, or changes, of plug-in units. 
      3.   The NMS MUST automatically maintains data synchronization 
        between itself and the NE. The operator SHOULD NOT have to be

        aware of exactly where the data physically resides or how the 
        NMS provides synchronization and consistency. 
      4.   Changes are logged, including date time stamp of the change. 
        Items that MUST be logged include: changes to hardware and 
        software, protection switching events, etc. 
      5.   The NMS MUST maintain the time source for the purposes of 
        providing timestamps. The NMS MUST enforces time-stamp 
        synchronization for the NE in its management jurisdiction. It 
        MUST maintain a single normalized time designation (GMT) for 
        all NE events and displays events with the local time. The 
        operator designates the local time zone. The NMS MUST 
        automatically adjusts for daylight savings time. 
      6.   The NMS GUI MUST be automatically updated with the new 
        synchronized data.

        MUST automatically detect the addition and retrieve all the 
        "hard" data from the NE about the new hardware. See Use Case 
        4.4 for more details. 
      2.   The operator MUST be able to configure the NE with the 
        following data: 
          .  NE name 
          .  NE user label (e.g. CLLI code) 
          .  NE equipment code and function code

          .  Plug-in administrative state (locked, unlocked, defective) 
          .  Network technology-specific data 
      4.   If the same type of plug-in had previously been installed in 
        the same slot, the NMS MUST automatically configures the new 
        plug-in the same way the old plug-in was configured. This is to 
        automate the handling of defect repair case in which a 
        defective plug-in is removed and a new one is installed.
