           RPKI Route Origin Validation Without Route Refresh
                    draft-ymbk-sidrops-rov-no-rr-00

Abstract

   A BGP Speaker performing RPKI-based Route Origin Validation should
   not issue Route Refresh to its neighbors when receiving new VRPs.

1.  Introduction

   Memory constraints in early routers caused classic [RFC4271] BGP
   implementations to not keep a full Adj-RIB-In (Sec. 1.1).  When doing
   RPKI-based Route Origin Validation ([RFC6811] and [RFC8481]), if such
   a BGP speaker receives new ROAs/VRPs, it might not have kept paths
   previously marked as Invalid.  Such an implementation must then
   request a Route Refresh [RFC7313] from its neighbors to recover the
   paths which might be covered by these new VRPs.  This will be
   perceived as rude by those neighbors as it passes a serious resource
   burden on to them.  This document recommends implementations keep but
   mark Invalidated paths so the Route Refresh is no longer needed.

2.  Related Work

   It is assumed that the reader understands BGP, [RFC4271] and Route
   Refresh [RFC7313], the RPKI [RFC6480], Route Origin Authorizations
   (ROAs), [RFC6482], The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) to
   Router Protocol [I-D.ietf-sidrops-8210bis], RPKI-based Prefix
   Validation, [RFC6811], and Origin Validation Clarifications,
   [RFC8481].

3.  Operational Considerations

   Operators deploying ROV SHOULD ensure that the router implementation
   is not causing unnecessary Route Refresh requests to neighbors.

   If the router does not implement the recommendations here, the
   operator SHOULD enable "soft reconfiguration inbound," which should
   cause the Adj-RIB-In to be effectively kept.  The operator should
   then ensure that this stops unnecessary Route Refresh requests to
   neighbors.

   If the router has insufficient resources to support this, it SHOULD
   not be used for Route Origin Validation.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document adds no additional security considerations to those
   already described by the referenced documents.

5.  IANA Considerations

   None
