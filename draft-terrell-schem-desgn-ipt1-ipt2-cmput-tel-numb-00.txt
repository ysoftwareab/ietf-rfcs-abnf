Abstract

    
    
    This paper focuses upon the simplification of the presentation for
    Defining the New Schematic of what was called the IPv7 and IPv8 IP
    Protocol Specifications. Which is accomplished by first, Renaming
    these Protocols to 'IPt1' and 'IPt2', where the "t" represents
    'Tele-Communications-Specification'. And second, by eliminating
    either all, or most of the extraneous information, which is not
    essential (at least not anymore) for understanding the overall
    Schematic Structure, nor the benefits, these Protocol Specifications
    actually represent. Which is further emphasized with a comparison,
    that uses The New and the Modern Binary Systems. Where is it shown
    that an increase in efficiency still exist, while the Number of IP
    Addresses remains Astronomically Large in both cases.

    In other words, the 'IPt1' and 'IPt2' IP Specifications represents a
    format, which is nothing more than a 'Telephone Number Implementation'
    that can be used as the primary IP Addressing format in any
    Telecommunications System, regardless of the choice for the Method in
    Binary Enumeration. Which means, in essence, this a Telecommunications
    Protocol that is essentially the 'Computer's Telephone Number'.

Introduction: Re-Viewing the Design Structure of the IPv4 Protocol

    
    Either by accident, or actual intent, clearly the IPv4 IP Addressing
    Specification is a marvel of ingenuity, because it represents a solid
    foundation, which is built upon the spirit of simplicity, without 
    sacrificing any of the functionally prescribed for it∆s' use. In other
    words, the IPv4 IP specification uses a Simple Natural Numbering System,
    designed specifically as the standard IP Addressing specification. Whose
    added purpose, was the elimination of having to remember some Naming
    convention, or the Name representing the Host, for addressing, to
    establish communication. (Compare the Telephone Number used today
    with the Telephone Number used, say, 50 years ago!) 

    To be more specific, the IPv4 specification is a 12 numbered IP
    Addressing System, which is divided into 4 sections separated by
    periods, called Octets. Each section, or Octet, can contain up to
    3 numbers, which have been specifically defined to provide the IP
    Address Location of any Network, or the Host, located within the
    Network itself. However, given the explosive growth of the Computer
    Industry, which supply the ever growing demands of the 'Consumer User'.
    This demand, and a 6 Billion World population total, seem to dwarf the
    Supply of the current number of available IP Addresses in the IPv4
    Addressing Scheme. And while, I feel hard Pressed to accept the
    belief, or the claim, for the existence of an IP Addressing shortage.
    I do believe however, that the reality of the so called IP Address
    shortage, is really a Statement, which Acknowledges IP Address waste.
    And this seems especially true, when observing Table 1-A, and knowing
    that there are IP Addresses which are excluded from the IP Address
    Allocation pool. (Noting specifically IP Address Classes 'D' and 'E'.)

    Furthermore, while this makes no mention of Corporate Greed, or IP
    Address Hoarding, as some of the additional ways to account for the
    need, or loss, of IP Addresses. There is a way, that has been Proven
    Mathematically, to construct a System for IP Addressing which is
    logically derived from the IPv4 Addressing format. This system would
    provide inherently, the necessary regulations, while eliminating any of
    the other possible problems that have been associated with this dilemma.
    Again, personal beliefs notwithstanding, while admitting to the possibility
    for Production Miracles...Still, having 3 Billion functional Computers all
    vying for a Global Network Connection, is indeed, a serious stretch in
    the belief for the Technology of Today, not to mention the overall
    intellectual development of Mankind in general.

Chapter I: The Computer's First Telephone Number, the IPt1 Design   
           Using the New Method of Enumeration for the Binary System
    
 
    
    The development of a new protocol specification whose foundation
    is based upon the Mathematics of Quantification, which was logically
    derived from the IPv4 specification, was not Mathematical Black Magic.
    In other words, while providing an additional 133 Million IP Addresses,
    the IPt1 IP Protocol reinforces the significance of the solid
    foundation, which was the essence of the IPv4 protocol specification.
    Now, just for a moment, take notice of Table 2-A, which is the IP
    Addressing Schematic that represents the IPt1 IP Protocol
    Specification.

    First you should notice, that this is a Logically derived Structure
    of the 'Synthetic' Decimal Representation for IPt1. Next, you will
    probably observe that it retains the same Classification Structure,
    with the added twist, in which each IP Addressing Class has been
    further Sub-Divided into '4' additional Sub-Sections within each
    of the IP Address Class. And upon the third inspection, you should
    notice the 'Default Addressing Structure', which is also different
    than that in the IPv4 Specification. However, the final inspection
    reveals the difference in the respective numberings for the
    'Default IP Subnet Mask', which is called the 'Default Subnet Mask'
    for the IPv4 specification, and it is called the 'Subnet Identifier'
    in the IPt1 specification. 



E Terrell                                                      [Page 7]

The Computer's Telephone Number                          March 22, 2002




    Nevertheless, these comparisons are not without an accompanying
    logical justification. Where by, the 'Default IP Subnet Mask'
    specification, specifies the Limit in Binary Notation, which deals
    with size of the Set that represents the Total Number of IP
    Addresses contained in the 'IP Address Class Range'. In which case,
    in the IPv4 specification, the number '255', is an Integer that
    represents the Modern Binary Number '11111111', and the Integer
    '256', in the IPt1 specification, represents the new Binary
    Representation for the Binary Number '11111111'. Moreover, since
    both of these IP Addressing Specifications, has a Default IP
    Addressing Structure that contains '4' Octets, then the respective
    equation which represents the Total Number of Available IP Addresses
    contained in each of the Sets representing these specification, is
    given respectively as; 255^4, and 256^4.
    
    Furthermore, the difference in the Naming Convention regarding
    the 'Default IP Subnet Mask', was meant to emphasize the efficiency
    of the mathematically derived technique, of Subnetting the IP
    Address Pool for each of the '5' IP Addresses Classes, which
    prevents the loss of IP Addresses for use in the assignment of
    the Host IP Address. And this process was noticed, when viewing
    the 'Default IP Address Structure', and is represented by the 'Y'
    in the IPt1 specification, which also resulted in a further
    Sub-Division of each of the '5' IP Address Classes. That is,
    given by the 'Laws for The Octet', as depicted in Table 1-B,
    we have: 'Where N = Number of Octet, and if 'Y' equals the
    Address Range '129 - 256', and 1 - 128 is not included in the
    Address Range, then 'Y' is Represented by the equation
    'Y = 256 - 128'.'

                              Table 1-B

                     {" The Laws of the Octet "} 

   'If the "Subnet Identifier specifies the value for the Variable Y",
       then the "Subnet Identifier" is said to Define the value of
          every Octet, for All Address Classes, in which the 'Y'
                      variable is assign': Hence;      

1. By definition, there exist 4 distinct Sections or Divisions 
   for every IP Address Class. However, the number of Sections 
   or Divisions that any IP Address Class can maintain is
   Mathematically derived, which is related to, and dependent
   upon, the IP Bit Address Number and the Total Number of IP
   Addresses defined for the IP Address Classes.

2. The Sections or Divisions of the IP Address Class are defined
   as: Primary, Secondary, Ternary, etc...And are labeled
   according to their respective Class Location (e.g.: Class A
   would be Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, and continued as
   would be necessary to distinguish every Division(s) of the
   Class, and the respective Divisions of the remaining IP 
   Address Classes; i.e. Address Classes B - E).

3. The Subnet Identifier assigns to the First Octet within each
   Section or Division of every IP Address Class, when it is not
   use as the Default Subnet Mask, only the value of the numbers
   available in the IP Address Range assigned to the IP Address
   Class.

4. Every OCTET, in every Address Class, which is not defined by
   the Subnet Identifier, can be assigned any value defined
   by the range given by; '1 - 256' (which excludes the use of All
   Integer '0's'). That is, provided that there is no succeeding
   Section or Division within the same Address Class, whose
   reference would be the same OCTET Number, which is Defined by
   the Subnet Identifier. (In other words, if there is such an
   OCTET in the succeeding Section or Division, then neither, can
   be defined by the Subnet Identifier and use All of the
   Numbers in the Integer Range specified above.)

5. For every OCTET within each Section or Division of every IP 
   Address Class, that is defined by the Subnet Identifier, and
   it is preceded by a Section or Division within the same
   Address Class, whose reference is the preceding Octet Number.
   Then, the Octet of the preceding Section or Division must be
   defined by the Subnet Identifier. (Because with the exception
   of the First Octet, the Octet of the preceding Section, or
   Division, must be defined by 'Y', and can NOT be assigned the
   value denoted by the Integer Range, which DEFINES the IP
   Address Range assigned to that IP Address Class.)

    In addition, any further comparison between these Protocol
    Specifications, which actually represents the Network and the Host
    IP Address assignments for the '5' IP Address Classes contained
    within these protocol specifications, as shown in Tables '3-A',
    and '4-A', respectively. Which not only reveal the efficiency gains
    of the IPt1 Protocol in the total number of available IP Addresses,
    but the benefits from the provisions of the inherent regulation
    that controls the issuances of the IP Addresses based upon the
    number the Host IP Address assignment required.

    The IP Addressing Scheme of IPt1 can serve the Global Internetworking
    Community now. Its implementation offers the most significant improvements
    ever conceived, well beyond any planed replacement system, or those
    presently in use. However, while there is a learning curve, it would
    actually impose no challenge for the seasoned professional. In fact, there
    are 'SEVEN' reasons that support its implementation and the reality of it
    being the logical replacement for IPv4.



















E Terrell                                                      [Page 13]

The Computer's Telephone Number                           March 22, 2002




1.    It maintains the Identical methods of enumeration for IP
      Addressing, as in IPv4, with a guarded respect for error
      correction(s).

2.    Its Header does not change from that used in IPv4,
      which means the version number can remain the same.

3.    It is only a 'Transparent Overlay' of the present
      Addressing System, which provides an increase of
      more than 133 million additional IP Addresses.

4.    It is a Logical Derivative of the IPv4 Addressing
      System, which eliminates all of the 'PREDEPLOYMENT'
      testing required of a New System, all while providing
      a flawless transition for its expansion, IPt2. Which
      makes the implementation of IPt1 and IPt2 cost effective.

5.    It Increases the Efficiency in the use of IP Addresses,
      because there are Absolutely No IP Addresses wasted on
      Host assignments in any of the Divisions or Sections of
      the respective IP Address Classes. But! Any Mathematical
      Analysis however, would clearly show that the Difference
      between the IP Address Loss of (16,777,216), and total
      Number of Host IP Addresses (16,581,375), represents a
      further reduction of the Total Number of reported IP
      Address Losses in the IPt1 IP Specification, to
      approximately 195,841 Addresses. In other words, the
      number of available Hosts IP Addresses determined by
      'Laws of the Octet', is always a 'Constant', which
      provides an unquestionable Efficiency in the use of
      the Total Number of Available IP Addresses for the IPt1
      IP Specification*.

6.    There is no Mandate Requiring Any Change to The Current
      Structure of the Private Networking Domains, nor to their
      Existing IP Addressing System or Format, which would extend
      beyond providing the Users with an additional convenience.
      In other words, asides from the Requirement for Changing
      the numbering and Naming of 'Default IP Subnet Mask' used
      in the DNS Server, and DHCP Servers, implementing these
      changes, which results from the change in the Binary
      System, would be all that is needed. Especially since,
      other than the Operating System itself, these changes
      would provide all the consideration as would be needed
      by the Applications the individual systems might contain.






E Terrell                                                      [Page 14]

7.    The existence of the Use of the Integer '0', except for the
      use in EMERGENECY BROADCAST COMMUNICATION. Which means, the
      Integer '0' would be excluded from any use involving any
      Normal IP Addressing Format. Thus, barring it from the use
      in any Octet of the IP Address, except in an Emergency.
      However, this is a special case, and an important function 
      of the Integer '0', which is beyond the limits imposed that
      Bars its (ALL Integer 0's) use in the 'Zone IP', 'IP Area
      Code', and the Octet(s) Defined by the 'Subnet Identifier'.
      In other words, this requirement prohibits All Network
      Administrators, Except those Responsible for Administrating
      the EMERGENECY BROADCAST COMMUNICATION Network, from the use
      or assignment of All Integer '0' to any Octet within an IP
      Address. And this does not effect nor alter the number of
      available of IP Addresses for use in the IPt1 and IPt2 IP
      Addressing Specification, nor its use in defining the
      'Default Subnet Mask'.


    Furthermore, these protocols could represent the END of the DHCP Server,
    because other than considerations for IP Address mapping to a 'Name', or
    the facilitation it provides in making IP Address assignment an automatic
    process, there would be No need for assigning a temporary IP Address.
    Which does ultimately suggest, Re-Defining the functions for a DHCP
    Server. Where by, the New specification would provide the complete
    Specifications and Capabilities for Sub-Net Creation, that would allow    
    Variable Sizing. It must also be capable of Suggesting, or Specifying
    the Number of IP Addresses Allocated for creating the Sub-Net, which
    would use the 'Gateway Router's Permanente IP Address' as the 'Point of
    Demarcation' to Assign an IP Address from the 'Sub-Net Pool' to every
    Device which is attached to the Sub-Net. In addition to Sizing and
    Maintaining the Reserve (Surplus) IP Address Pool, and also maintaining a
    Permanente Server IP Address Assignment. The New definition for the 'DHCP
    Server' would also incorporate all of the functions, which would be
    necessary to allow any person to Design and implement a Network of any
    Size. Moreover, this specification must also included 'IP PBX' suffixing
    Capabilities. That is, the specification for Enabling the Trailing Numbers
    ('1 - 999') ':X.X.X', which are attached to the End of an IP Address, that
    would provide the Services for 'VVoIP' (Video & Voice Over IP: See 'Ex.
    1'), using only the Router to Direct the Communications to the Right
    Sub-Components in a 'Session Initialization Protocol' Environment. And to
    complete the set-up for Network Operations, the 'DHCP Server' must also
    establish, and verify, the final LAN, WAN, or MAN (etc...) Connections.

Chapter II: Developing the Country Code, and the Sub-Country code
            Designations: The Design of the IPt2 Protocol



    The advantages of IPt2 however, surmount far beyond any 32 Bit IP
    Addressing System now employed, or any IP Addressing System ever
    conceived, which was derived from a designed that mimics the format
    of the Typical Telephone Number, having a 'Country Code' and a
    'Area Code' Prefix (See Figure 2-B, and Figure 3-B). Nevertheless,
    while retaining the ease of use and implementation of IPv4 / IPt1,
    IPt2 provides an additional number of available IP Addresses that's
    staggering, to say the very least. In other words, the comparable
    analogy would be, IPt1 can provide an individual IP Address to
    'nearly' every person in the world today. While IPt2 presently,
    using only 48 Bits of this 64 Bit IP Addressing System, can sustain
    the inhabitants of more than '46 Thousand Planets'. And if the total
    Address Range of this 64 Bit System is used, then IPt2 can provide
    an individual IP Address to the inhabitants of more than '3 Billion
    Planets', with each planet having a population equal to the
    population total of the world today. Which is to say, if IPt2 were
    expanded to the same Address Space as IPv6, which is a 128 Bit IP
    Address. Then the total number of available IP Addresses would be
    greater than 3.402 x 10^38. Which is greater than the available IP
    Address offering of IPv6. In other words, what this means in the
    terms of the foregoing scenario, is that: 'The people of planet
    Earth can, when using the 128 Bit IP Addressing format of IPt2,
    colonize more than 5.36 x 10^28 Planets, with each Planet having
    a population total equal to the existing count, and still have
    reserve IP Addresses'.

    In other words, IPt2 represents 255^2 (65,025) copies of the IPt1
    IP Addressing Schematic, in which there is only one copy assigned
    per IP Area Code Address. And there is a total of 255 Zone IP Addresses
    that uses only 48 Bits of this 64 Bit Addressing System, which has
    '255 IP Area Codes' per 'Zone IP Address. It amounts to a total
    availability of 255 x 256^3 IP Addresses, which forms the Base, or
    IPt1 is the Base Addressing Schematic for the IPt2 IP Specification,
    that yields a total availability of 2.78 x 10^14 IP Addresses, using
    only the Prefix Designations, specified as the 'Zone IP', and the 'IP
    Area Code'. And while, the reality of the IPt2 Addressing Schematic,
    is somewhat miss leading, as depicted in Table 5-A , it still
    represents an accurate total of the number of available IP Addresses
    contained in this Protocol Specification. However, the reality of the
    Schematic is still IPt1, which is Prefixed using the 'Zone IP' and
    the 'IP Area Code', to generate this extremely large pool of
    available IP Addresses.

    And finally, the added feature of the IPt2 Protocol, is that, everyone,
    everywhere, can be assigned their own personal, Home Use, IP Address. In
    other words, the supply pool is so large, that the IP Addresses can be
    free for everyone. Additionally, the regulation is built into the IPt2
    IP Addressing Structure. In fact, it is made for Distribution by
    Continents, using the 'Zone IP' prefix, and depending upon the Population
    of the Countries contained within the each of these Continents, each
    Country can be assigned '1' or 'More' 'IP Area Code' Addresses, because
    there are '255' of these IP Area Code Addresses for every 'Zone IP'
    Address. Which means, with each 'IP Area Code' Address issued, the
    Recipient Country would get exactly '1' copy of the 'IPt1' IP Addressing
    Schematic, that contains more than 4 Billion IP Addresses. Take for
    example, the United States, Canada, and Mexico, which are all part of the
    same Continent. They in turn, would share the same 'ZONE IP' Address, which
    contains "255 IP AREA CODE" Addresses. In which case, the distribution
    could be '1' IP Area Code' Address package assigned to every 'State' or
    'Province', which is located within the Countries contained in the
    Continent. But, if you will note, this would amount to the distribution
    approximation represented by: ('50 IP Area Code' Addresses) = United
    States, ('6 IP Area Code' Addresses) = Canada, and ('4 IP Area Code'
    Addresses) = Mexico. And the sum of the Distribution equals '60' IP Area
    Code Addresses, which leaves the Continent with a surplus of '195' IP
    Area Code Addresses, containing more than 4 Billion IP Addresses each.

E Terrell                                                      [Page 22]

    However, this was only an example of one possible solution for assigning
    the 'Zone IP' Addresses. Because just as easily, one can see that an entire
    'Galaxy', or Star System, could be assigned to one 'GSSZone IP' Address,
    in a '64' IP Addressing System using only a '56' Bit IP Addressing format.
    And the 'Solar Systems' within this Galaxy could be assigned one 'Zone IP'
    Address, in which the related 'Planets' would be assigned one 'IP Area
    Code' from the 'Zone IP' Address of their respective 'Solar Systems'.
   
    Still, even this, does not depict the actual Mathematical efficiency
    defined in the IPt1 and IPt2 IP Specifications, because in reality, while
    the '99.999...+ %' efficiency rating, in overall use, is true. However,
    this 'Rating' says nothing about the overall number of viable 'Network
    Addresses', which Increases by a factor greater than '17.3'. Nor does this
    'Rating' reflect the increase in the number of 'Host Addresses'. That is,
    when depicting a one-to-one comparison with IPv4, this represents an
    increase which is greater than 50%, and a Network-to-Host distribution
    percentage, that would surpass even this amount.

    In other words, one copy of the 'IPt1' Schematic would suffice to meet the
    needs of the entire 'Planet', today, and there would still be a Surplus of
    IP Addresses. What this actually means Mathematically, is that, the 'IPt2
    Header' could always be used, even in the choice for the actual 'Bit Range'
    of the IP Address, because the IP Address Range in this IP Specification is
    indeed a variable. And for now at least, this can be within the range of
    '32 to 64' Bits, which is incremented in '8 Bit' Segments when the IP
    Address is beyond the '32 Bit format specified in 'IPt1'. Furthermore, it
    should clearly be understood, this is a Mathematical System that can quite
    easily be expanded to an 'IPt8 Format' (And Beyond!), which is an IP
    Addressing System that uses '256 Bit IP Addresses*'. Nevertheless, in all
    cases, a Surplus of available IP Addresses would always exist, which means
    that the allocation of these IP Addresses should be determined by actual
    usage or needs, and not waste. Needless to say, whatever the final decision
    may be, IP Address Availability, Clearly, is no longer an issue.   

    In a word, the future is Now! Because everything, which is, or can be
    represented as an Electrical Signal for Telecommunications, can use the
    Global Network (Global-Net) as the only Thoroughfare, which would Unite the
    Lives and Livelihoods of Everyone, Everywhere, for the benefit of all
    Mankind.

    This is a Proposal, an example notwithstanding, whose graphical depiction
    is indeed functional. Where by, the TTL and Hop Limit are program functions
    related to the Router's Table. And the Security Bit is a 2 Bit
    representation of some combination of 01, and 00. Where a '01' in the first
    bit tells the Router to route as a Direct Connection, and a '01' in the
    second Bit tells the Router that the transmission is Encrypted. While Type
    Of Service remains unchanged and Next Header is a '1' Bit indicator, being
    either a '01' or a '00'. And the Total Length remain the same, but the
    Direction Bit of either a '01' or '00' tells the Router if the Packet is an
    InterCom or OuterCom communication, which would assist the FireWall in
    Blocking Illegal Attempts to Access Private Domains. Which also could
    include the ablility to write a 'IP PBX Extension' for VVoIP Transmissions.
    
    Nevertheless, figure 2-C outlines the Mathematically Derived 'Default IP
    Address Structure' that is used in IPt2, which employs IPt1's Addressing
    Schematic as its Default, or Base Addressing Format. Which is also Prefixed
    by the Zone IP and the IP Area Code IP Addresses, and designated by the
    Subnet Identifier, that follows the format presented in figure '3-B'.

           is accomplished using '32 Bit' increments, which increases the
           overall size of the Header itself. This is, as it should be,
           because it reflects the size of the 'Base IP Addressing Schematic';
           'IPt1'. Thus, preserving the Logic and Mathematical Continuity,

Appendix II: Using the Modern Binary System to Depict the IPt1 and IPt2
             IP Protocol Specifications



    Before beginning a comparison, I would suggest that you review the 'Laws
    of the Octet' to fully understand the Logic and the Mathematics, which
    is the Hallmark denoting the difference between Tables '3-A' and '4-A'.
    That is, while noting that Table '4-A' uses the New Method derived for
    Binary Enumeration, it's expansion focuses upon the Schematic, the
    foundation established by the 'Laws of the Octet', which was derived from
    the Logic of the Mathematics of Quantification. These Laws provided the
    foundation, the Schematic, which is what makes the IPt1 and IPt2 IP
    Specifications so powerful. In other words, after a consideration of the
    overall increase of the 133 Million IP Addresses provided by 'IPt1', and
    the results from 'IPt2', which can be explained using the Planet scenario
    demonstrated above (i.e. 44 or 46 Thousand Planets in a 48 Bit System,
    and 2.87 or 3 Billion Planets in a 64 Bit System). It would then be
    realize, that the actual difference between the Numbers presented in each
    of these Tables, reflects only one part of the Logical Justification. Which
    represents the distinction in counting that differs in each of these Binary
    Systems. However, the Schematic, which is the second part of the Logical
    justification, maintains a significance that can only be viewed when
    each of these Systems are represented in the Tables using the same Methods
    for Binary Enumeration.
     
    That is, when comparing the 'IPt1' and 'IPv4' specifications, which are
    both using the Modern Methods for Enumerating in Binary Notation, as shown
    in Tables '3-A' and 'A-I', where there is No actual increase in the Total
    Number of available IP Address. Then the benefit however, is clearly
    established by the Schematic, which shows the Efficiency and Superiority
    that the IPt1 IP Addressing Specification maintains over IPv4, and which
    certainly surpasses that of IPv6. Furthermore, when accepting both parts
    of the Logical Justification, any further comparison between the Systems
    represented by Tables 4-A, 5-A, A-I, and A-III, which signifies the
    importance of the Logical Foundation provided by the Schematic. The
    conclusions, as resulting from the Mathematics of Quantification, remains
    valid for all Addressing Specifications represented in the Tables noted
    above, regardless of the choice of the Method for Binary Enumeration.

    Nevertheless, while it was Mathematically proven, using the Mathematics
    of Quantification, that the New Binary System represented the Logical,
    and Mathematically correct System. It is doubtful nonetheless, especially
    without the foundation offered by my next work, that an agreement could
    ever be reached, regarding which System, being correct, is the system
    that should be used. Even still, any comparison between the Tables which
    represents each of these Binary Systems. Clearly shows, that the
    Mathematics of Quantification established the Logic and Mathematical
    foundation, rationalized the choice, whose conclusions Defined the Binary
    System. Hence, the IPt1 and IPt2 IP Addressing Specifications results
    from a Schematic whose Logical Derivation from the Mathematics of
    Quantification remains unquestionably valid, regardless of the choice in
    the Method for Binary Enumeration.
