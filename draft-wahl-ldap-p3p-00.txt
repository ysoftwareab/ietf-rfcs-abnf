Abstract

   This document defines attributes that can be retrieved via
   Lightweight Directory Access Protocol version 3 (LDAP) requests,
   which contain URIs pointing to the privacy policy documents
   describing access to a directory server and that apply to the
   contents of a subtree of entries.  These attributes enable a
   directory client to retrieve the privacy policies before sending
   further requests to the directory server.

2.  Policy documents

   The attributes defined in this document contain Uniform Resource
   Identifiers (URIs) [6].  The URIs are anticipated to be of a form,
   such as http [7], which has a protocol for the retrieval of an XML
   document.  This document does not define how to retrieve XML content
   from the directory server itself.

   Unlike the use of privacy policies in web protocols described in
   section 2 of P3P [1], this specification does not incorporate the
   indirection procedures of the policy reference file.  (Policy
   reference files are omitted as their INCLUDE and EXCLUDE elements
   assume a relative URL hierarchy, which not appropriate to the
   identification of resources in directory servers which follow a
   different hierarchy, and the policy documents are likely stored on a
   different kind of server than the directory server itself).  Instead,
   the URI directly identifies the document containing the POLICIES
   element.

   The URI stored in the directory attributes defined in the sections
   below MUST identify a file which is an UTF-8 encoded XML format
   document.  That file MUST contain a POLICIES element, as defined in
   section 3.2 of P3P1.0 [1].  The URI MUST contain a URI fragment that
   specifies the name of the policy within that POLICIES element.

   For example, a directory entry might contain the attribute

       subtreeP3PrivacyPolicy: http://www.example.com/pol.xml#policy-ds

   The client SHOULD then attempt to contact the server for
   www.example.com via HTTP, and obtain the file /pol.xml.

   This file might resemble:


       <POLICIES xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2002/01/P3Pv1">
            <POLICY name="policy-www"
             discuri="http://www.example.com/disc.html"> .... </POLICY>
            <POLICY name="policy-ds"
             discuri="http://www.example.com/disc.html"> .... </POLICY>
       </POLICIES>

   The client would locate the POLICY element which has a name matching
   that of the fragment in the URI, policy-ds.  The client processing of
   this information MUST be in accordance with section 2.4.4 of P3P1.0
   [1].

3.  Attribute for Directory Server Privacy Policy

   This attribute publishes the policy of the directory server as it
   relates to collecting data from the LDAP client.  The purpose of this
   attribute is to ensure that directory clients have the ability to
   become aware of the privacy implications of further interactions with
   a particular directory server.  Based on this information, the
   directory client might choose to disconnect or might present an end
   user with information on the privacy policy.

   The semantics of this attribute are analogous to those of a web
   server publishing via HTTP and P3P the policy for browsers accessing
   a web site hosted on that server.  Specifically, it informs the
   directory client that operation requests sent to the directory server
   might be used for one or more purposes, as described in the policy
   document.

   The attribute is defined as follows:

       attributeTypes: ( OID-TBD
                        NAME 'serverP3PrivacyPolicy'
                        EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
                        SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15
                        SINGLE-VALUE USAGE directoryOperation )

   The value is a single URI, which is encoded as a string in the UTF-8
   charset [5].  The form of URI is specified in section 2 above.

   This attribute MAY be present in the directory server's root DSE.
   The attribute is retrievable if a client performs a base object
   search of the root DSE (with a distinguished name of zero length)
   with a filter of "(objectClass=*)", as described in section 4 of RFC
   2251 [4].

4.  Attribute for Directory Subtree Privacy Policy

   This attribute publishes the policy of the directory service as it
   relates to the privacy protection of a subtree of entries, typically
   representing individual persons, that are held in a particular
   subtree of the directory.

   The semantics of this attribute is different from that of the
   previous section.  This attribute provides a directory client that
   might be searching and extracting information from a particular
   directory subtree information about individuals, with the privacy
   policy governing that information.  How these individuals'
   information was entered into the directory is outside of the scope of
   this document, but is is assumed that the privacy policy applied to
   the gathering of this information, and SHOULD be respected by clients
   that are searching it.

   The attribute is defined as follows:

       attributeTypes: ( OID-TBD
                        NAME 'subtreeP3PrivacyPolicy'
                        EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
                        SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15
                        SINGLE-VALUE )

   The value is a single URI, which is encoded as a string in the UTF-8
   charset [5].  The form of URI is specified in section 2 above.

   This attribute MAY be present in any entry.

   In order to allow this class to be present on objects of many
   different structural classes, an auxiliary object class is defined.

       objectClasses: ( OID-TBD
                       NAME 'subtreeP3PrivacyPolicyClass'
                       AUXILIARY
                       MAY ( subtreeP3PrivacyPolicy ) )

   This auxiliary class might most usefully be combined with the
   organization or organizationalUnit classes.

   Clients MUST NOT assume the absence of this class in an entry's
   objectClass implies that the subtreeP3PrivacyPolicy attribute is not
   present in the entry, as this attribute might be part of a privately-
   defined schema, or be provided through collective attributes.

   A client SHOULD locate this attribute in entries which are typically
   used for the base object of subtrees of entries representing people,

   before searching to extract data from those entries.  For example,
   the attribute may be stored in the base organization entry, or in an
   organizationalUnit entry for a particular category of users (such as
   employees or customers).

   Applying different privacy policies to each individual user's entry
   is outside of the scope of this document.

5.  Data Schema

   This document does not attempt to define a general mapping between
   the LDAP schema representation and the P3P Basic Data Structures and
   base data schema.

   For a policy referenced by a serverP3PPrivacyPolicy, the anticipated
   P3P data structures that would be used in the policy would be those
   of sections 5.5.3 (logins), 5.5.4 (certificates) and 5.5.7 (access
   logs and internet addresses) of P3P1.0 [1].  The login id would
   correspond to the distinguished name or other identifier which the
   client provides in an authenticated bind request.  A client which
   sends add, modify or modrdn operations SHOULD also check for the
   subtreeP3PrivacyPolicy for the subtree in which these operations are
   targeted.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document addresses two security concerns with LDAP directories.

   The first concern is that most directory servers maintain a log of
   client requests.  For each connection, the log might contain the
   incoming connection's source IP addresses, the distinguished name or
   other forms of identity used in bind requests, the type and fields of
   requests sent by the client, as well as the server's responses.  This
   log may contain personally identifiable information, particularly
   bind information, as well as information that could later be
   correlated with other server's log information, in order to identify
   the user and their patterns of operations.  Some organizations which
   operate directory services, in particular publicly accessible
   services or those which are available to the organization's partners
   and customers, may wish to advertise the privacy policy of their
   directory servers, in order to ensure that persons operating
   directory clients accessing those servers are aware of what data is
   being collected and the procedures surrounding this.

   The second concern is that most directories contain a significant
   quantity of personally identifiable and personal information about
   individuals who are represented by entries in the directory.
   Directory clients SHOULD ensure that information which is obtained
   from the directory is handled in such a way that the privacy
   protections asserted for those individual's information is not
   violated.  This document defines a mechanism for a client to at least
   be able to obtain the privacy protection requirements in the form of
   a P3P policy element, and a client application which parses this can
   determine whether its handling of the information is in accordance
   with the policy.

   Directory server deployments which provide unrestricted or public
   access to information SHOULD permit clients to search to retrieve the
   serverP3PrivacyPolicy attribute from the root DSE without needing to
   have bound.  The server SHOULD also consider this operation part of
   the P3P "Safe Zone", as described in section 2.4.3 of P3P1.0 [1].

   Directory clients SHOULD exercise good practice when determining how
   to access the resources identified by the URIs present in the
   serverP3PrivacyPolicy and subtreeP3PrivacyPolicy attributes.

   Section 7 of RFC 3986 [6] also discusses security considerations when
   handling URIs.
