Abstract

   This memo describes the procedures by which the IETF appoints
   representatives to the various bodies of the Internet
   Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and to
   the Protocol Supporting Organization (PSO) related to ICANN.

1. Introduction

   The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)
   depends for some of its activities on the Protocol Supporting
   Organization (PSO). The PSO is required to appoint three members
   of the ICANN Board of Directors, and to appoint a Protocol Council 
   to give appropriate advice to ICANN.

Internet Draft        IETF Appointments to the ICANN PSO     Oct   1998


   As a member of the PSO, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
   is required to

     - appoint up to three members to the PSO Board
     - nominate members to the ICANN Board
     - nominate members to the PSO/ICANN Protocol Council

   This memo defines the IETF procedures for these appointments.
   
2. Members of PSO Board

   The PSO Board has limited duties, mainly oversight of appointments
   to the ICANN Board and Protocol Council based on nominations from
   the PSO members, and financial oversight of payments from PSO 
   members to ICANN. For this reason an elaborate procedure
   for appointing the PSO Board members is unnecessary, as long as 
   they are individuals answerable to the IETF under [RFC 2282]. 

   The IETF members of the PSO Board shall be the current IETF Chair,
   the current Chair of the Internet Architecture Board (IAB), and 
   one other current member of the IAB or of the Internet Engineering 
   Steering Group (IESG), appointed by consensus of the IAB and IESG.
   In the event that the IETF is required to appoint only two
   members of the PSO Board, these shall be the IETF Chair and
   IAB Chair. In the event that the IETF is required to appoint
   only one member of the PSO Board, the IETF Chair and the IAB
   Chair shall decide which one of them it shall be.

   
3. Members of ICANN Board of Directors

   These are important policy-making positions and the
   nominees should be selected by a specific open process.

   Each year, the IETF Nominating Committee shall nominate
   the required number of persons to terms on the ICANN
   Board, using as much as possible the procedures defined 
   in [RFC 2282].
   
   The number of persons and their terms will be defined
   by the by laws of ICANN and the PSO. However, in normal
   circumstances the nominations shall take place according
   to the timetable established by [RFC 2282], in anticipation
   of known vacancies on the ICANN Board.

   The nominees are subject to a subsequent election by the 
   members of the PSO as defined by its by laws.

   IETF nominees to the ICANN Board are subject to the recall
   procedures defined in [RFC 2282].

4. Members of the Protocol Council

   The Protocol Council is intended to act as a technical
   advisory body for ICANN and as such it is necessary and sufficient
   for the IETF nominees to be recognised as experts by the IETF
   and answerable to the IETF under [RFC 2282].

   The IETF nominees for the Protocol Council shall be the thirteen
   current voting members of the IAB. If additional nominees
   are necessary, the IAB shall choose them from a pool
   consisting of all current IESG members and all current IETF 
   working group chairs. Note that working group chairs are
   answerable to the IESG.

   The nominees are subject to a subsequent election by the 
   members of the PSO as defined by its by laws.
