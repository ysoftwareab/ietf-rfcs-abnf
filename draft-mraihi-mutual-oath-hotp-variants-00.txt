 Abstract  
     
    This document describes Mutual OATH, a mechanism for mutual 
    authentication based on the HOTP algorithm [HOTP] introduced 
    recently by OATH (initiative for Open AuTHentication) [OATH] and 
    submitted as an individual draft to the IETF last year. The 
    security and strength of Mutual OATH depends on the properties of 
    the underlying building block HOTP, which is a construction based 
    on HMAC [RFC2104] using SHA-1 as the hash function.

   1. Introduction 
    
    The HOTP algorithm is counter based and intended for synchronous 
    authentication mode systems. It has been implemented under various 
    form factors such as USB tokens, software client application, 
    validation servers, applets for smart-cards, etc. 
     
    OATH has identified several user cases and scenarios that require 
    an asynchronous variant to accommodate users who do not want to 
    maintain a synchronized authentication system. The commonly 
    accepted method for this is to use a challenge-response scheme. 
     
    This draft introduces the concept of randomized versions of HOTP, 
    where the counter field is replaced or extended by a function of 
    several parameters such as a random question and a personal 
    identification code or password. 
     
    Challenge response mode of authentication is widely adopted in the 
    industry. Several vendors already offer software applications and 
    hardware devices implementing challenge-response - but each of 
    those uses vendor-specific proprietary algorithms. For the benefits 
    of users we need a standardized challenge-response algorithm to

    allow multi-sourcing of token purchases and validation systems to 
    facilitate the democratization of strong authentication. 
     
   2. Requirements Terminology 
     
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
    this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14. 
     
   3. Algorithm Requirements 
     
    This section presents the main requirements that drove this 
    algorithm design. A lot of emphasis was placed on flexibility and 
    usability, under the constraints and specificity of the HOTP 
    algorithm and hardware token capabilities. 
     
    R1 - The shared secret MUST be embedded in a tamper resistance 
    device or securely implemented in a software application. 
     
    R2 - The secret SHOULD be stored in a hardware device for 
    additional flexibility (mobility) and security. 
     
    R3 - The algorithm MUST be capable of supporting different modes of 
    authentications. 
     
    R4 - The challenge value MUST be randomly generated for each use of 
    the authentication protocol and SHALL NOT be re-used. 
     
    R5 - The algorithm MUST allow for the challenge to be presented to 
    the user in numeric or alphanumeric form. 
     
    R6 - If the challenge is displayed to the user, the challenge 
    length SHOULD be selectable; the specification should define the 
    maximum length for a challenge. 
     
    R7 - There MUST be a fixed randomly generated secret (key) for each 
    token/soft token that is shared between the token and the 
    authentication server. 
     
    R8 - The challenge MAY be generated with integrity checking (e.g., 
    parity bits). This will allow tokens with pin pads to perform 
    simple error checking if the user enters the value into a token. 
     
    R9 - The algorithm MAY include a counter function. 
     
    R10 - The algorithm SHOULD be used in dual-key mode. The single key 
    is mainly to support legacy tokens.

    R11 - All the HOTP communications MUST take place over a secure 
    channel e.g. SSL/TLS, IPsec connections. 
     
   4. Mutual OATH Definition 
  
    In this section, we introduce the HOTP algorithm variants for 
    mutual authentication. 
     
    Words used in this chapter: 
     
    K - Key, a shared secret known to all parties 
    C - Counter, a predefined sequence of values that can be calculated 
    by all parties 
    P - Hashed version of PIN/password that is known to all parties 
    Q - Challenge, a predefined value that may change and is known to 
    all parties during execution of the algorithm 
    T - Fixed value that is used in a transaction 
    AI - Algorithm identifier, describes in detail in section 4.2 
     
    4.1  HOTP Algorithm 
     
    The HOTP algorithm is based on an increasing counter value and a 
    static symmetric key known only to the prover and verifier parties. 
    HOTP has been introduced as an internet draft and is currently in 
    the RFC-editor queue for final review. 
     
    As a reminder: 
     
                   HOTP(K,C) = Truncate(HMAC-SHA-1(K,C)) 
     
    Where Truncate represents the function that converts an HMAC-SHA-1 
    value into an HOTP value of 6 to 8 digits. 
     
    The Key (K), the Counter (C) and Data values are hashed high-order 
    byte first. The HOTP values generated by the HOTP generator are 
    treated as big endian. 
     
    We refer the reader to [HOTP] for the full description and further 
    details on the rationale and security analysis of HOTP. 
     
    We introduced in [HOTP] the notion of a Data field that would be 
    used for generating the One-Time Password values. Using a Data 
    field opens for more flexibility in the algorithm implementation, 
    provided that the Data field is clearly specified.  
     
    A straightforward variant is to replace the counter value C by a 
    random question Q to define a Response as a function of the 
    challenge Q: 
     
  
  
 OATH-HMAC-OTP            Expires - April 2005                 [Page 4] 
 HOTP: An HMAC-based One Time Password Algorithm          December 2005 
  
  
       Response = HOTP (K,Q) = Truncate (HMAC-SHA-1(K,Q)) 
     
    The present draft describes the different variants based on similar 
    constructions. 
     
    4.2  Algorithm Identifier 
     
    It is important for both parties willing to interact to know the 
    operations to be performed, namely which variant is to be used. 
     
    Let AI bit a binary string, and the different bits indicate which 
    combination of parameters is used to compute an HOTP response. 
     
    We could also specify the algorithm itself - by default, HOTP is 
    based on HMAC-SHA-1 but recent attacks on hash functions and new 
    standard works might result in recommendations to use another 
    function for HMAC. 
     
    We define the algorithm identifier AI as follows: 
     
    AI = Type | Pb | Qb | Cb | Tb | Mode 
     
    Where: 
       Type is a 4-bit value to specify the algorithm type; at the 
    moment, 4 types are defined: 
          0000: HMAC-SHA-1 without truncation 
          0001: HMAC-SHA-1 with Dynamic Truncation for 6-digit 
          0010: HMAC-SHA-1 with Dynamic Truncation for 7-digit 
          0011: HMAC-SHA-1 with Dynamic Truncation for 8-digit 
       Pb - single bit that indicates whether or not a hash of a PIN or 
    Password will be used in the computation; 
       Qb - single bit that indicates whether or not a random Q will be 
    used in the computation; 
       Cb - single bit that indicates whether or not a counter C will 
    be used in the computation; 
       Tb - single bit that indicates whether or not a fixed value T 
    will be used in the computation. 
       Mode is a 4-bit value that defines the different modes of 
    computation; at the moment, 4 types are defined: 
          0000: plain mode, single key 
          0001: plain mode, dual key 
          0010: chained mode, single key 
          0011: chained mode, dual key 
          With the chained mode as described in section 4.5 
     
    For instance, if the algorithm used is HOTP (K, C) with Dynamic 
    Truncation to generate 6-digit HOTP values as described in [HOTP] 
    as default mode then AI = 0001 0010 0000.

    4.3  Mutual OATH Authentication 
     
    A straightforward variant is to replace the counter value C by a 
    random question Q to define a randomized Response as a function of 
    the challenge Q: 
     
       Response = HOTP (K,Q) = Truncate (HMAC-SHA-1(K,Q)) 
     
    The challenge-response sequence is the following for parties A and 
    B sharing knowledge of secret (key) K and willing to perform Mutual 
    OATH authentication: 
     
       1- A sends a random question Q_A to B and AI = 0001 0100 0000 
       2- B computes Response_B = HOTP (K,Q_A) and sends it to A with 
    his own random question Q_B 
       3- A checks Response_B and if correct, computes Response_A = 
    HOTP (K,Q_B) 
       4- B checks Response_A and if correct, acknowledges party A 
     
    Both parties are authenticated. 
     
    4.4  Dual-key Mode 
     
    The key SHOULD be pre-divided into different usages. K1 is used for 
    computing responses and K2 to check responses. The opposite is used 
    for the other party. Depending on whether storage or computation is 
    cheaper, we could either store a longer key K = K1 | K2 or set K1 = 
    K and K2 = K xor Constant or K2 = SHA-1(K) for instance. 
     
    The challenge-response sequence is the following for parties A and 
    B sharing knowledge of secret (key) K. K is divided into K1 and K2. 
     
       1- A sends a random question Q_A to B and AI = 0001 0100 0001 
       2- B computes Response_B = HOTP (K2,Q_A) and sends it to A with 
    his own random question Q_B 
       3- A checks Response_B and if correct, computes Response_A = 
    HOTP (K1,Q_B) 
       4- B checks Response_A and if correct, acknowledges party A 
     
    Both parties are authenticated. Separating into K1 and K2 protects 
    against another party sending predefined questions "Q_A"'s to B for 
    querying specific information. 
     
    We recommend this mode of computation for mutual OATH.

    4.5  Chained Mode 
    
    Another interesting computation mode is to chain the computations 
    of different responses. It might have valuable applications such as 
    to verify that a certain sequence of operations has taken place. 
     
    The challenge-response sequence is the following for parties A and 
    B sharing knowledge of secret (key) K and willing to perform Mutual 
    OATH authentication in chained mode: 
     
       1- A sends a random question Q_A to B and AI = 0001 0100 0011 
       2- B computes Response_B = HOTP (K2,Q_A) and sends it to A with 
    his own random question Q_B 
       3- A checks Response_B and if correct, computes Response_A = 
    HOTP (K1,Q_B|Response_B) 
       4- B checks Response_A and if correct, acknowledges party A 
     
    Both parties are authenticated. 
     
    4.6  PIN/Password "salted" HOTP Response 
     
    In this case, the PIN/password value used to control the usage of 
    the token and/or protect access to the key embedded in the hardware 
    (or software) token can be injected in the Response computation, as 
    well as the random question Q: 
        
       Response = HOTP (K, Q|P) 
     
    Where | stands for concatenation. 
     
    The challenge-response sequence is the following for parties A and 
    B sharing knowledge of secret (key) K and willing to perform Mutual 
    OATH authentication: 
     
       1- A sends a random question Q_A to B and AI = 000110000 
       2- B computes Response_B = HOTP (K2,Q_A|P) and sends it to A 
    with his own random question Q_B 
       3- A checks Response_B and if correct, computes Response_A = 
    HOTP (K1,Q_B|P) 
       4- B checks Response_A and if correct, acknowledges party A 
     
    Obviously, the string P can be empty if party A or B does not have 
    a PIN or Password - e.g. a validation sever computing a response to 
    be authenticated by a user will probably not have the usage of a 
    PIN or password. 
     
    It opens for interesting combinations where the algorithm 
    identifier AI could be used to specify computations both ways - 
    e.g. the token could include the PIN in his computation and the 
  
  
 OATH-HMAC-OTP            Expires - April 2005                 [Page 7] 
 HOTP: An HMAC-based One Time Password Algorithm          December 2005 
  
  
    server, knowing the hash checks the HOTP response; in its 
    calculation on the other hand, no PIN value would be included since 
    the server would not have one. 
     
    4.7  Signature - Using HOTP with challenge and fixed value 
     
    The combination of a fixed value and random value enables to 
    generate different signature values for different fixed values - 
    the computation is randomized by the question Q. This is important 
    when signing the same value more then once. 
     
       Signature = HOTP (K, Q|T) where | stands for concatenation. 
     
    The sequence for B generating a signature to be checked by A is the 
    following, assuming the mode of computation is dual-key plain mode: 
       1- A sends a fixed value C, a random question Q to B and AI = 
    0001 0110 0001 
       2- B computes Response_B = HOTP (K2,Q|T) and sends it to A  
       3- A checks Response_B and if correct, acknowledges party B has 
    validated the value T 
     
    In an hostile environment a third party can trick party B to reveal 
    the correct response for a given value. Again, all exchanges should 
    take place over a secure channel - using SSL/TLS, or similar 
    encryption mechanism. 
  
   5. Security Considerations 
    
    The keys for HOTP can be of any length equal or longer than 20 
    bytes. Keys longer than 20 bytes are acceptable; they are first 
    hashed using the supported hash function, e.g. SHA-1, to become 
    usable. Nevertheless, the extra length would not significantly 
    increase the cryptographic strength of Mutual OATH, provided the 
    randomness of the original key material is sufficient. 
     
    Keys need to be chosen at random or using a cryptographically 
    strong pseudo-random generator properly seeded with a random value. 
    We RECOMMEND to follow the recommendations in [RFC1750] for all 
    pseudo-random and random generations. The pseudo-random numbers 
    used for generating the keys SHOULD successfully pass the 
    randomness test specified in [CN]. 
     
    The conclusion of the security analysis detailed in [HOTP] is that, 
    for all practical purposes, the outputs of the dynamic truncation 
    on distinct counter inputs are uniformly and independently 
    distributed strings. 
     
    The analysis demonstrates that the best possible attack against the 
    HOTP function is the brute force attack.

   6. IANA Considerations 
    
    This document has no actions for IANA. 
    
   7. Conclusion 
     
    This draft introduced several variants of HOTP for randomized 
    response and short signature-like computations. 
     
    The algorithm identifier AI provides for an easy integration and 
    support of different HOTP flavors within an authentication and 
    validation system. 
     
    Mutual OATH should enable cross-authentication both in connected 
    and off-line modes, with the support of different response sizes 
    and mode of operations.
