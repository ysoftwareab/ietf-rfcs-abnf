  <h1 id="rfc.section.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> Introduction</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">There are several applications that require symmetrical paths between a pair of speakers. One such application is 1588 <a href="#IEEE-1588">[IEEE-1588]</a> which requires that the Delay_Resp message takes the same path as the associated Delay_Req message. <a href="#I-D.ietf-tictoc-1588overmpls">[I-D.ietf-tictoc-1588overmpls]</a> describes a method for transporting PTP messages (PDUs) over an MPLS network to enable proper handling of these packets. Currently, the only way to ensure that the different PTP messages follow a symmetrical path is by statically configuring the RSVP-TE LSPs. This is unscalable and will not work in case of network failures as MPLS FRR may not guarantee symmetrical alternate paths.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">This document describes how RSVP-TE can be used for setting up bi-directional LSPs for regular MPLS and the extensions required in FRR to ensure that the alternate paths are also symmetrical.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> RSVP-TE to signal Bi-directional LSP</h1>
<p><a href="#RFC3473">[RFC3473]</a> describes a point-to-point bidirectional LSP mechanism for the GMPLS architecture, where a bidirectional LSP setup is indicated by the presence of an Upstream Label in the Path message.  The Upstream_Label object has the same format as the generalized label, and uses Class-Number 35 (of form 0bbbbbbb) and the C-Type of the label being used. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.2">For regular MPLS the Upstream_Label object will be used with C-Type value of 1.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.3">Typically, a node initiates an RSVP session by adding the RRO to the Path message.  The initial RRO contains only one subobject - the sender's IP addresses.  If the node also desires label recording, it sets the Label_Recording flag in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object.  This document extends this mechanism by also adding the Upstream label that has been advertised in the RRO subobject. Thus the initial RRO will now contain the sender's IP address and the Upstream label advertised by it.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.3">3.</a> <a href="#FRR" id="FRR">Fast Reroute mechanisms</a>
</h1>
<p><a href="#RFC4090">[RFC4090]</a> extensions can be used to perform fast reroute for the mechanism described in this document when applied within packet networks. This section only applies to LSRs that support <a href="#RFC4090">[RFC4090]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.2">This section uses terminology defined in <a href="#RFC4090">[RFC4090]</a>,  and fast reroute procedures defined in <a href="#RFC4090">[RFC4090]</a> MUST be followed unless specified below.  The head-end and transit LSRs MUST follow the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE and FAST_REROUTE object processing as specified in <a href="#RFC4090">[RFC4090]</a> for each Path message.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.3">Since its a bi-directional LSP the detour LSPs and the bypass tunnels that are used for the protected LSP must also be bi-directional. This is required so that path symmetry is maintained even in an event of a network failure.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.4">It should be noted that in case of bi-directional LSPs, the LSRs involved will play the role of both the Point-of-Local-Repair (PLR) and Merge Point (MP) at the same time during the failure. The router that is the PLR will become the MP for the traffic thats coming from the opposite direction.  </p>

      Fig 1: Topology for
       link protection
		</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.5">In the Figure 1 assume that ABCD is the protected LSP. For protecting link BC, there is a bidirectional bypass tunnel BEFC (or a detour LSP in case of 1-on-1).  B is the PLR and C is the MP for the traffic flowing from A towards D and B is the MP, and C the PLR for traffic flowing in the opposite direction (from D towards A).  </p>

         node protection
		</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.6">In the Figure 2 ABCDE is the protected LSP and BFGD is the bypass tunnel for protecting the node C. In this case B is the PLR and D the MP for traffic from A towards E, and the roles reverse, i.e. B becomes the MP and D the PLR for traffic flowing in the opposite direction (from E towards A).  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.1">3.1.</a> <a href="#Upstream" id="Upstream">Discovering Upstream Labels</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.1">To support facility backup, the PLR must determine a label that will indicate to the MP that packets received with that label should be switched along the protected LSP.  This can be done without explicitly signaling the backup path if the MP uses a label space global to that LSR.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.2">As described in <a href="#RFC4090">[RFC4090]</a>, the head-end LSR MUST set the "label recording requested" flag in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object for LSPs requesting local protection.  This will cause (as specified in <a href="#RFC3209">[RFC3209]</a>) all LSRs to record their INBOUND labels and to note via a flag whether the label is global to the LSR.  Thus, when a protected LSP is first signaled through a PLR, the PLR can examine the RRO in the Resv message and learn about the incoming labels that are used by all downstream nodes for this LSP. Similarly the MP, which will become the PLR for the reverse direction will learn about the upstream labels that are being used by the upstream nodes for this LSP by examining the RRO in the Path message.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.3">The bypass tunnels and the detour tunnels that are set up for a bidirectional LSP must be bidirectional as well. They can internally use the Upstream_label technique that was described earlier to establish a bidirectional LSP.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.4">4.</a> <a href="#elements" id="elements">Behavior of various network elements in FRR</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">When a failure happens in the network the PLR router closest to the failure must perform the traffic protection. The MP router is the router that is the next hop to the failure point and merges the protected traffic back to the original path. In case of bidirectional LSPs, the same LSR is PLR in one direction and the MP for the other.  Let us examine in detail what each network element does for the MPLS FRR.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.1">4.1.</a> <a href="#HE" id="HE">The Head-End Router Behavior</a>
</h1>

<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.2">The Path message which has the FRR information in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object is propagated from the head-end LSR to the Tail router.

<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.3">When a network failure occurs the PLR, or router upstream of the failure to be precise, uses FRR to reroute the traffic around the failure, and notifies the head-end LSR by (i) setting the FRR "Local protection in use" flag (0x2) in the RRO object of the Resv message and (ii) by sending a PathErr message with an ERROR object with code 0x19 - RSVP Notify Error and error value 0x3 - Tunnel locally repaired.  The router that is downstream of the failure (traditionally the MP in case of unidirectional LSPs) also uses FRR to reroute the traffic around the failure.

<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.1">The PLR router of the protected LSP is also the origination point (head-end Router) of the protection tunnel (detour LSP or bypass tunnel).  It is also the MP for the reverse protection tunnel at the same time. When an intermediate LSR receives a Path message carrying a SESSION_ATTRIBUTE with the FRR flags set, it assumes the role of a PLR and starts signaling a bi-directional FRR protection tunnel. In case facility backup is requested by the head-end LSR, the PLR signals a new bi-directional tunnel only if a bypass tunnel fulfilling the requirements does not already exist.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.2">In the sections that follow the terms upstream and downstream are used in reference to the direction of traffic flow from the head-end towards the tail end. Thus router the tail router is downstream to the head-end.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.3">When a network failure happens, the upstream router local to the failure assumes the role of the PLR and switches the traffic to the protection tunnel. This PLR is from now on referred to as the "upstream PLR". The downstream router, local to the failure also assumes the role of the PLR and switches the traffic to the bidirectional protection tunnel that is set up. This PLR is referred to as the "downstream PLR".  These routers can use either the bi-directional detour LSP or a bi-directional bypass tunnel, depending upon what	was requested by the head-end LSR.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.4">The egress label that each PLR uses depends upon the kind of protection provided.  The behavior of the "upstream PLR" remains unchanged for both one-to-one backup and facility backup protection mechanisms as described in <a href="#RFC4090">[RFC4090]</a>. The subsequent sections thus only explain the behavior of the  "downstream PLR"  during these two protection modes.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.5">Once the traffic gets switched to the protection path, the "downstream" PLR does not need to inform the HE router about the network failure.  </p>

The label arriving from the immediate downstream router of the protected tunnel is swapped with the detour label, and the traffic is sent through the detour LSP.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.2.2.p.1">In the case of facility backup, the data from the protected LSP is tunneled through the bypass tunnel. Therefore, the outer label of the tunneled packet in the reverse direction is the label distributed by the immediate upstream router of the bypass tunnel. The "downstream PLR" also needs to know what label was expected by the router where this tunneled traffic merges (MP) at the upstream. The record label option makes this information available from the RRO in the Path messages for the protected LSP.  This is the inner label that must be in the tunneled packet. Thus, the "downstream PLR" swaps the incoming label from the immediate downstream router in the protected path with these two labels and sends the path through the bypass tunnel.  </p>

Since it knows that its doing node protection over the bypass tunnel, it will use the label that the NNHop router ("upstream" MP) expects instead of the label that the Nhop router (failed LSR) expects.

<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.3">Figure 5 shows two MPs associated with a bi-directional protection tunnel. This document refers to the MP defined in  <a href="#RFC4090">[RFC4090]</a> as a downstream MP.

This means that it is still responsible for maintaining the protection tunnel's state by sending the Resv messages to the PLR and is also responsible for maintaining the state of the protected tunnel during the network failure. The upstream MP, defined in this document, is not required to do any of these. Its only responsible for merging the reverse traffic back to the protected path.  </p>
