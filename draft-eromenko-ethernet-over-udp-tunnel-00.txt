                      Ethernet over UDP/IP Tunnel
                     =============================
                          Specification draft


Abstract

   This technique is simple to implement, and provides an effective 
   tunnel between two LAN segments (Ethernet Broadcast Domains).

Introduction

   In Ethernet-over-UDP, no fragmentation or reassembly occur of the 
   inner traffic. No retransmission or security provided.
   It was built as a quick and simple way to inter-connect various 
   systems, and it is intended where maximum performance and 
   simplicity required.

   It is very effective tunnel for both legacy software, which requires
   non-IP protocols, such as NETBIOS or IPX/SPX, as well as for 
   development of new network protocols.

(bytes)

   There is no "default UDP port" to listen to incoming sessions,
   and it must be manually configured by the admin.

   This protocol adds 26 bytes of overhead.


Implementations

   Multiple inter-operable Open-Source implementations exist, including
   VirtualBox, Qemu/KVM and Virtual Distributed Ethernet (VDE).


Security Considerations

   Traffic sent over a UDP Tunnel is not encrypted.
   When using on the public Internet, you can either encrypt it on 
   the outter network level (with IPsec or SSH),  
   or use encrypted protocols in the inner network (TLS or SSH).
   The security properties are similar to Ethernet.
