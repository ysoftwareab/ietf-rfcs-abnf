1.  Introduction

   This specification defines a new XML schema for thoroughly and
   completely representing and sharing timezone information that is
   consistent across platforms and software systems.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The namespace "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:timezones" is reserved for the
   XML elements defined in this specification, its revisions, and
   related specifications.  XML elements defined by individual
   implementations MUST NOT use the "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:timezones"
   namespace, and instead should use a namespace that they control.

   In this specification, the prefix "TZ:" is used for the namespace URI
   identified above.

   The term "content item" denotes a typed data entity that is a basic
   unit of sharing timezone information.

   The term "tz xml" is used to describe the overall set of content
   items and their relationships in defining timezone information.  It
   refers to the complete set of XML elements described in this
   specification.

   The term "user" denotes a single user, group of users, or registered
   organization that shares knowledge of timezone information.  Users
   can be involved in authoring, providing or consuming timezone
   information.

   The term "service" denotes an application entity that facilitates the
   storing and sharing of tz xml with other services or clients.  A
   service can facilitate authoring, providing or consuming of timezone
   information.  The entity represented by a service could be a web
   application, a web server or something more precise such as a
   specific application running on a specific device.

   The term "client" denotes an application entity that requests
   timezone information in order to properly handle time and timezones
   in software applications.  The entity represented by a client could
   be an operating system, a server application, a client application or
   a cloud service.  The client endpoint interacts with the service
   endpoint.

3.  Schema Definition

3.1.  Common Requirements

   The following requirements apply to all parts of this specification.

   1.  All date-time values MUST conform to the Date and Time
       specification of [RFC3339], with the following added constraints:

       *  Times MUST be expressed in milliseconds.

       *  Times MUST be given in the UTC timezone, and end in "Z",
          without a timezone offset.

   2.  All XML element and attribute tags are case-sensitive and must
       appear in a Time Zone document as they appear in this
       specification.

3.2.  TZ:TimeZone XML element

   The TZ:TimeZone element is the top-level element of any timezone
   information document.  It MUST contain several top-level, timezone
   properties as well as one TZ:StandardTime element.

   +--------------+----------------------------------------------------+
   | Attribute    | Description                                        |
   +--------------+----------------------------------------------------+
   | ID           | A required, string attribute.  This is the unique  |
   |              | ID of a timezone.                                  |
   | Revision     | A required, integer attribute.  The version number |
   |              | of the timezone.  It SHOULD be incremented by one  |
   |              | each time a change is made to any of the           |
   |              | timezone's properties.                             |
   | LastModified | A required, xsd:dateTime attribute.  The date and  |
   |              | time that the timezone data was last modified by   |
   |              | any entity creating or saving data through a       |
   |              | service.                                           |
   | Language     | A required, xsd:language attribute.  The language  |
   |              | of any human-readable strings in the tz xml.       |
   |              | These would be properties such as Name and         |
   |              | Description.                                       |
   +--------------+----------------------------------------------------+

3.2.1.  TZ:Name XML element within TZ:TimeZone

   The TZ:Name element is an optional element within TZ:TimeZone.  When
   present, it corresponds to a human-readable name for the timezone.
   It may be stored and returned in a number of different languages.

   See section :TODO for more information on International Strings for
   TZ XML.

3.2.2.  TZ:Description XML element within TZ:TimeZone

   The TZ:Description element is an optional element within TZ:TimeZone.
   When present, it corresponds to a human-readable description for the
   timezone.  It may be stored and returned in a number of different
   languages.  See section :TODO for more information on International
   Strings for TZ XML.

3.2.3.  TZ:InfoURL XML element within TZ:TimeZone

   The TZ:InfoURL element is an optional element within TZ:TimeZone.
   When present, it must have a valid xsd:anyURI value.  The URL defined
   here is used to reference a Web site or other Internet information
   regarding the timezone.

3.2.4.  TZ:CalendarScale XML element within TZ:TimeZone

   The TZ:CalendarScale element within TZ:TimeZone is required and
   represents the underlying calendar scale or calendar system that the
   timezone definition is based on.  An example of a TZ:CalendarScale is
   "Gregorian".  The value is case-insensitive.

3.2.5.  TZ:ReferencedControllingAuthority XML element within TZ:TimeZone

   The TZ:ReferencedControllingAuthority element within TZ:TimeZone is
   required and represents the governing body that has authority to
   change how time is observered in a given region.  A timezone has one
   and only one controlling authority.  This element represents a
   reference to a separate content item.  See section :TODO for more
   information on the TZ:ControllingAuthority content item.

   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   | Attribute | Description                                           |
   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   | ID        | A required, string attribute.  This is the unique ID  |
   |           | of the controlling authority.                         |
   | Revision  | A required, integer attribute.  The version number of |
   |           | the controlling authority that is being referenced.   |
   |           | Together with ID, this attribute provides a unique    |
   |           | reference to a controlling authority.                 |

3.2.6.  TZ:StandardTime XML element within TZ:TimeZone

   The TZ:StandardTime element is required and denotes the timezones
   regular offset from Universal Co-ordinated Time (UTC).  Standard time
   is observed whenever other exceptions to standard time (Daylight
   Savings, European Summer Time) are not in effect.  TZ:StandardTime
   has a name, a base offset from UTC, date ranges that MAY denote
   historical observances of the offset.  See section :TODO for more
   information on TZ:StandardTime and its child elements.

   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   | Attribute | Description                                           |
   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   | ID        | A required, string attribute.  This value MUST be a   |
   |           | unique element identifier within the timezone content |
   |           | item.  The ID is used exclusively to identify         |
   |           | human-readable, localizable element values within     |
   |           | TZ:StandardTime                                       |
   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+

3.2.6.1.  TZ:Name XML element within TZ:StandardTime

   The TZ:Name element is required and represents the friendly, human-
   readable display name of the timezone when standard time is observed.

3.2.6.2.  TZ:BaseUtcOffset XML element within TZ:StandardTime

   The TZ:BaseUtcOffset element is required and represents the number of
   hours from UTC that the timezone observes when in standard time.
   Since the base UTC offset can change for a timezone historically, TZ:
   StandardTime can contain one-to-many TZ:BaseUtcOffset elements.  The
   value of the offset and the years that the offset was in effect are
   expressed as child elements of TZ:BaseUtcOffset.

3.2.6.2.1.  TZ:BaseUtcOffsetValue XML element within TZ:BaseUtcOffset

   The TZ:BaseUtcOffsetValue element denotes the value of the offset
   from UTC for an observance of a timezone.  It uses the requires the
   format HH:MM:SS.MMM.  A minus (-) symbol is used to express a local
   time occurring before UTC.  For example, standard time in the Eastern
   Time Zone of the United States is expressed as the offset value -05:
   00:00.000.

3.2.7.  TZ:StandardTimeChange XML element within TZ:TimeZone

   The TZ:StandardTimeChange element is optional and MAY represent any
   changes to a timezone's regular standard time observance.  Examples
   of this include Daylight Savings Time in the United States or Summer

   Time in Europe where the observed offset from UTC for a timezone
   shifts by an hour to conserve daylight.  TZ:StandardTimeChange has a
   name, a value that represents the change from standard time and a
   number of rules that express when transitions to this change occur.
   See section :TODO for more information on TZ:StandardTimeChange and
   its child elements.

   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   | Attribute | Description                                           |
   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   | ID        | A required, string attribute.  This value MUST be a   |
   |           | unique element identifier within the timezone content |
   |           | item.  The ID is used exclusively to identify         |
   |           | human-readable, localizable element values within     |
   |           | TZ:StandardTimeChange (like TZ:Name for example).     |
   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+

3.2.7.1.  TZ:Name XML element within TZ:StandardTimeChange

   The TZ:Name element is required and represents the friendly, human-
   readable display name of the timezone when a change to standard time
   is in effect.  For example, Pacific Daylight Time.

3.2.7.2.  TZ:OffsetChange XML element within TZ:StandardTimeChange

   The TZ:OffsetChange element denotes the delta or change from the base
   UTC offset observed during this change to standard time.  The value
   of the offset change requires the format HH:MM:SS.MMM.  A minus (-)
   symbol is used to express a change to the base offset that is less
   than the standard UTC offset.  UTC.  For example, daylight time in
   the Eastern Time Zone of the United States is expressed as a change
   by one hour to the base UTC offset of -05:00:00.000.  So the offset
   change would be -01:00:00.000.

3.3.  TZ:EffectiveYearRange XML element

   The TZ:EffectiveYearRange element appears within TZ:BaseUtcOffset and
   within TZ:OffsetChange and contains information referring to the
   effective range of a base UTC offset or offset change.  The StartYear
   and EndYear attributes dictate the range of years.

   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   | Attribute | Description                                           |
   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   | StartYear | A required, integer attribute.  This represents the   |
   |           | year that the offset began to take effect.  It MUST   |
   |           | be a positive integer.                                |

   | EndYear   | A required, integer attribute.  This represents the   |
   |           | year that the offset ceased being valid.  It MUST be  |
   |           | a positive integer.                                   |
   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+

3.3.1.  TZ:TransitionPeriod XML element within TZ:EffectiveYearRange

   The TZ:TransitionPeriod element contains specific rules for a
   transition.  They ultimately express moments in time.  These rules
   have the following requirements:

   o  Together, they define a moment in time for a transition

   o  They have a granularity of milliseconds

   o  Transition rules include expressions for Month, DayOfMonth,
      DayOfWeek and TimeOfDay.

   o  They define the effective date of a transition by using comparison
      operators.  It is not intended that the expressions would define
      an effective range of an observance, so rules should not be geared
      toward a range of time.  To understand the start and end date of
      an observance, you must parse the effective range information.

   o  There are no default values assumed; you should be explicit about
      each piece.

   o  The expression of rules is very flexible, but it should be
      optimized to be as small a data set as is necessary to represent a
      transition point.  Use ranges of years whenever possible to keep
      the data set small.

   o  Cardinality is 0-N for expressions.  Because of the flexibility,
      it is possible for authors to write rules that don't make sense or
      are missing critical pieces of information.  An implementation of
      the service SHOULD check for unwanted conditions and send warning
      messages or tips.

3.3.1.1.  TZ:Start and  TZ:End XML elements within TZ:TransitionPeriod

   The TZ:Start element contains child elements that define when a
   transition starts.  The TZ:End element defines when a transition
   period ends.

3.3.1.1.1.  TZ:Month XML element within TZ:Start or TZ:End

   TZ:Month defines a month of the year in which a transition period
   starts or ends.

   TZ:DayOfMonth defines a day of the month in which a transition period
   starts or ends.

   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   | Attribute | Description                                           |
   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   | Value     | A required, integer attribute.  For example in April, |
   |           | the days of the months would range in value from 1-31 |
   |           | for the Gregorian calendar.                           |
   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+

3.3.1.1.3.  TZ:DayOfWeek XML element within TZ:Start or TZ:End

   TZ:DayOfWeek element defines a weekday that a transition period would
   start or end.  This is used specifically when defining relative start
   and end times (for example, second Sunday in October in the Gregorian
   calendar).

   +-------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | Attribute         | Description                                   |
   +-------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | Value             | A required, integer attribute.  The numeric   |
   |                   | value starts with 1 for the first day of the  |
   |                   | week.  In Gregorian scale, 7 = Sunday, for    |
   |                   | example.                                      |
   | OccurrenceInMonth | An optional, integer attribute.  Used in      |
   |                   | DayOfWeek rules only.  It takes the value set |
   |                   | +/-N occurrence in the month.  For example, a |
   |                   | -1 value is the last occurrence of a certain  |
   |                   | day of the week in the month specified. -2    |
   |                   | would be the second to last specified day of  |
   |                   | the week in the month specified.  See section |
   |                   | :TODO for an example of its usage.            |

5.  Security Considerations

   TBD

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new URN to identify a new XML namespace for
   timezone data.  The URN conforms to a registry mechanism described in
   [RFC3688].

   This document defines a new media type.  The registration is in
   Section 6.2.

6.1.  Namespace Registration

   Registration request for the timezone namespace:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:timezone

   Registrant Contact: See the "Authors' Addresses" section of this
   document.

   XML: None.  Namespace URIs do not represent an XML specification.

Internet-Draft                Timezone XML                     July 2010


6.2.  Media Type

   This section defines the MIME media type for use with timezone XML
   data.

   To:  ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject:  Registration of media type application/timezone+xml

   Type name:  application

   Subtype name:  timezone+xml

   Required parameters:  none

   Optional parameters:  charset

   Encoding considerations:  timezone data is typically UTF-8 and thus
      the XML representation will follow that.  As a result, for 7-bit
      transports, data in UTF-8 MUST be encoded in quoted-printable or
      base64.

   Security considerations:  See Section 5.

   Interoperability considerations:  This media type provides a syntax
      for timezone data based on XML.

   Published specification:  This specification.

   Applications which use this media type:  Calendaring and scheduling.

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s):  None

      File extension(s):  XML data should use "xml" as the file
         extension.

      Macintosh file type code(s):  None specified.

   Person & email address to contact for further information:  See the
      "Author's Address" section of this document.

   Intended usage:  COMMON

   Restrictions on usage:  There are no restrictions on where this media
      type can be used.

   Author:  See the "Author's Address" section of this document.

   Change controller:  IETF

7.  Acknowledgements

   This specification was suggested by discussion that took place within
   the Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium's Timezone Technical
   Committee.  The authors thank the participants of that group for
   their input.  In particular, the main design of this schema was
   provided by Bryan Keller, Quincy Milton, Derek Shaw, and Durgaprasad
   Gorti.
