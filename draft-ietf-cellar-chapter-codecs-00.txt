1.  Introduction

   _TODO_

2.  Status of this document

   This document is a work-in-progress specification defining the
   Matroska file format as part of the IETF Cellar working group
   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/cellar/charter/).  It uses basic
   elements and concepts already defined in the Matroska specifications
   defined by this workgroup.

3.  Security Considerations

   Tag values can be either strings or binary blobs.  This document
   inherits security considerations from the EBML and Matroska
   documents.

4.  IANA Considerations

   To be determined.

5.  Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

6.1.  Matroska Script (0)

   This is the case when ChapProcessCodecID = 0.  This is a script
   language build for Matroska purposes.  The inspiration comes from
   ActionScript, javascript and other similar scripting languages.  The
   commands are stored as text commands, in UTF-8.  The syntax is C
   like, with commands spanned on many lines, each terminating with a
   ";".  You can also include comments at the end of lines with "//" or
   comment many lines using "/* */".  The scripts are stored in
   ChapProcessData.  For the moment ChapProcessPrivate is not used.

   The one and only command existing for the moment is GotoAndPlay(
   ChapterUID );. As the same suggests, it means that, when this command
   is encountered, the Matroska Player SHOULD jump to the Chapter
   specified by the UID and play it.

6.2.  DVD menu (1)

   This is the case when ChapProcessCodecID = 1.  Each level of a
   chapter corresponds to a logical level in the DVD system that is
   stored in the first octet of the ChapProcessPrivate.  This DVD
   hierarchy is as follows:

   You can also recover wether a Segment is a Video Manager (VMG), Video
   Title Set (VTS) or Video Title Set Menu (VTSM) from the
   ChapterTranslateID element found in the Segment Info.  This field
   uses 2 octets as follows:

   1.  Domain Type: 0 for VMG, the domain number for VTS and VTSM

   2.  Domain Value: 0 for VMG and VTSM, 1 for the VTS source.

   For instance, the menu part from VTS_01_0.VOB would be coded [1,0]
   and the content part from VTS_02_3.VOB would be [2,1].  The VMG is
   always [0,0]

                                 Table 2

   If the level specified in ChapProcessPrivate is a PGC (0x20), there
   is an octet called the Playback Type, specifying the kind of PGC
   defined:

   *  0x00: entry only/basic PGC

   *  0x82: Title+Entry Menu (only found in the Video Manager domain)

   *  0x83: Root Menu (only found in the VTSM domain)

   *  0x84: Subpicture Menu (only found in the VTSM domain)

   *  0x85: Audio Menu (only found in the VTSM domain)

   *  0x86: Angle Menu (only found in the VTSM domain)

   *  0x87: Chapter Menu (only found in the VTSM domain)

   The next 4 following octets correspond to the User Operation flags in
   the standard PGC.  When a bit is set, the command SHOULD be disabled.

   ChapProcessData contains the pre/post/cell commands in binary format
   as there are stored on a DVD.  There is just an octet preceding these
   data to specify the number of commands in the element.  As follows:
   [# of commands(1)][command 1 (8)][command 2 (8)][command 3 (8)].

   More information on the DVD commands and format on DVD from the
   [DVD-Info] project.
