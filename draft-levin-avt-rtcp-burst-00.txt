Internet-Draft    Extensions  to RTCP for Burst Stream      October 2008


1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in "Key words for use in
   RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels " [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   Sections 4 and 5 of "Unicast-Based Rapid Synchronization with RTP
   Multicast Sessions" [I-D.versteeg-avt-rapid-synchronization-for-rtp]
   describe possible reasons for a synchronization delay while joining a
   multimedia stream in a random point in time.  Over the years,
   different techniques have been developed in the industry in order to
   cope with these problems.  Today, organizations such as DVB and ATIS
   are standardizing applications and topologies in the IPTV arena that
   require a smooth user experience while joining a multimedia multicast
   stream at a random point in time.

   We believe that the IETF needs to define a set of standard tools to
   be used by these and other applications, while deferring the
   application framework to other standardization bodies.  We believe
   that the required tools can be built as extensions to existing RTP
   and RTCP mechanisms.

   Specifically, this document proposes extensions to "RTCP-Based
   Feedback" [RFC4585] to reduce synchronization time when an RTP
   receiver joins a multicast stream at a random point in time.  The
   defined mechanism relies on the definitions and the mechanisms
   introduced in "RTP Retransmission Payload Format" [RFC4588] and "RTCP
   Extensions for Single-Source Multicast Sessions with Unicast
   Feedback" [I-D.ietf-avt-rtcpssm].


3.  Definitions

   The following terms are used in this document:

   Media Session:  Media session as defined in "RTP: A Transport
      Protocol for Real-Time Applications" [RFC3550].

   Original Stream:  The one-to-many RTP stream of single source
      multicast (SSM) RTP packets to which an RTP receiver joins at a
      random point in time.

Internet-Draft    Extensions  to RTCP for Burst Stream      October 2008



   Feedback Target:  (Unicast RTCP) feedback target as defined in "RTCP
      Extensions for Single-Source Multicast Sessions with Unicast
      Feedback" [I-D.ietf-avt-rtcpssm].

   Retransmission Packet:  A "retransmission packet" as defined in "RTP
      Retransmission Payload Format" [RFC4588].

   Burst Packet:  An RTP packet constructed according to definitions of
      "RTP Retransmission Payload Format" [RFC4588] and generated upon a
      request from the receiver as defined in this document.

   Retransmission Stream:  The stream of retransmission and burst
      packets associated with the original multicast stream and
      transmitted in a separate unicast RTP session in accordance with
      standard RTP rules.

   Burst Stream:  The stream of burst packets associated with the
      original multicast stream and typically transmitted at an
      accelerated rate.  A burst stream is a logical subset of a
      retransmission stream (i.e., transmitted in the same RTP session).

   Retransmission Source:  The RTP/RTCP endpoint generating
      retransmission stream that can be triggered and controlled by
      mechanisms defined in "RTP Retransmission Payload Format"
      [RFC4588] and in this document.

   Media and Reference Information:  Media and reference information is
      a media stream containing the media content and the metadata about
      it sufficient to reconstruct and use the content in the context of
      a specific application.  The meaning, format, and the size of this
      information are specific to the application and are out of scope
      of this document.

   Nominal Original Bandwidth:  The actual bitrate of the original
      multicast stream.  The burst mechanism defined in this document
      assumes that the nominal bandwidth of the original multicast
      stream is lower than the maximum bandwidth that the receiver can
      accommodate for incoming traffic.

   Maximal Burst Bandwidth:  The maximal bitrate for the unicast burst
      stream, which is also the maximum bitrate that the receiver can
      accommodate for incoming traffic.


4.  Architectural Assumptions

   The burst mechanism defined in this document assumes that a receiver

Internet-Draft    Extensions  to RTCP for Burst Stream      October 2008


   can accommodate an incoming media and reference information stream at
   a bandwidth higher than the nominal bandwidth of the original
   multicast stream.

   The burst mechanism defined in this document is performed on the
   transport layer, i.e., it is independent of the particular codec or
   application in use.

   The burst mechanisms defined in this document MUST support an
   architecture where the original multicast source, its feedback
   target, and the retransmission source are logical entities that are
   either collocated, or implemented by different physical entities in
   the network.  The communications between these logical entities are
   out of scope for this document.

   The mechanism defined in this document builds on the existing IETF
   mechanisms as described in this section below:

   The retransmission source and the receiver both support "RTP
   Retransmission Payload Format" [RFC4588].  Specifically, they support
   the session multiplexing mode as required for the multicast case.
   The receiver learns about the addresses of the multicast source and
   the RTP session used for sending the retransmission stream by out-of-
   band means (e.g., SDP).

   A unicast RTCP session is signaled out-of-band and used for sending
   feedback messages to the original multicast stream in accordance with
   the concepts defined in "RTCP Extensions for Single-Source Multicast
   Sessions with Unicast Feedback" [I-D.ietf-avt-rtcpssm].
   Specifically, this unicast session is used for sending NACK messages
   to trigger retransmission of the original packets over a separate
   unicast RTP session as defined in "RTP Retransmission Payload Format"
   [RFC4588].

   The same unicast RTCP session between the receiver and the feedback
   target is used for sending the new RTCP feedback primitives as
   defined in this document to trigger and control the burst stream of
   packets.

   The same unicast retransmission RTP session is used to carry the
   burst stream of packets that are formatted according to "RTP
   Retransmission Payload Format" [RFC4588] from the retransmission
   source to the receiver.

   The retransmission stream carrying both burst and retransmission
   packets MUST comply with "RTP Retransmission Payload Format"
   [RFC4588].  Specifically, the sequence number has the standard RTP
   definition, i.e., it MUST be one higher than the sequence number of

Internet-Draft    Extensions  to RTCP for Burst Stream      October 2008


   the preceding packet sent in the retransmission stream; the
   retransmission packet timestamp MUST be set to the original
   timestamp, i.e., to the timestamp of the original multicast packet.


5.  Burst Mechanism Description

   The set of tools defined in this document is designed to facilitate a
   simple "burst mechanism" as described below:

   Before joining the original multicast media session, a new receiver
   learns about the addresses of the multicast source, its feedback
   target, and the RTP session used for sending retransmission packets
   by out-of-band means (e.g., SDP).

   The receiver indicates that it needs to receive media and reference
   information "as soon as possible" within the bandwidth limits (i.e.,
   maximal burst bandwidth) known to the receiver by sending a new RTCP
   Feedback "Lack of Synchronization Indication" (LSI) to the feedback
   target.

   Upon receiving the indication, the feedback target calculates the
   actual burst rate based on the received value and its own local
   policy and sends a new RTCP Feedback "Burst Bandwidth Indication"
   (BBI) containing the expected bandwidth to the receiver.

   Then the retransmission source proceeds to stream the media and
   reference information of the indicated original stream using the
   retransmission packet format at an accelerated rate (i.e. at the rate
   indicated in the BBI, which is some rate higher than the nominal
   original bandwidth).

   Note that as a general rule, if the streaming rate needs to be
   adjusted according to the retransmission local policy, the feedback
   target first sends a new RTCP Feedback BBI containing the updated
   bandwidth and then the retransmission source proceeds to stream at
   the newly indicated bitrate.

   Once the information in the burst stream matches the information
   being streamed in the original stream (i.e. the burst stream "catches
   up" with the original multicast media session), the feedback target
   sends a new RTCP Feedback BBI and the retransmission source drops to
   the nominal original bandwidth or a lower rate, subject to local
   application policy.

   At any stage, the receiver can join the original multicast stream and
   ask to terminate the burst stream by sending a new RTCP Feedback
   "Synchronization Completed Indication" (SCI) to the feedback target.

6.  Burst Mechanism Example Flow

   Figures 1 and 2 below show an example of how a simple burst mechanism
   can be implemented using the extensions defined in this document.
   The flow can be tailored to various applications' needs and
   constraints, which are out of scope for this document.  Figure 2 also
   illustrates how the burst stream can be followed by retransmission
   packets, and then the client can close both the retransmission and
   the original sessions by sending RTCP BYE packets to each.

7.  The RTCP Extensions: New Transport Layer Feedback Messages

7.1.  Lack of Synch Indication (LSI)

   The LSI FB message is identified by PT=RTPFB and FMT=2.

   There MUST be exactly one LSI contained in the FCI field.

7.1.1.  Semantics

   With the Lack of Sync Indication, a receiver can inform a feedback
   target that it will be joining the original multicast media session
   and therefore it needs to receive media and reference information
   over the retransmission RTP session at an accelerated rate.

   The LSI includes a Bitrate value which identifies the maximum bitrate
   that the receiver will accommodate for the incoming unicast burst
   stream.

7.1.2.  Format

   The Lack of Synch Indication uses additional FCI fields, the contents
   of which are depicted in Figure 3.  The length of the FB message MUST
   be set to 3+n, with n being the number of 32-bit words comprising the
   "Extensions" contained in the LSI field.  If the "Extensions" does
   not fall on a 32-bit boundary, then the last word MUST be padded to
   the boundary using further bits set to 0.

      accommodate.

Internet-Draft    Extensions  to RTCP for Burst Stream      October 2008


   Extensions:  Optional extended parameters encoded using Type/Length/
      Value (TLV) elements as described below:

      Type:  A single-octet identifier that defines the type of the
      parameter represented in this TLV element.

      Length:  A two-octet field that indicates the length of the Value
      field.

      Value:  Variable sized set of octets that contains the specific
      value for the parameter.

7.2.  Burst Bandwidth Indication (BBI)

   The BBI FB message is identified by PT=RTPFB and FMT=3.

   There MUST be exactly one BBI contained in the FCI field.

7.2.1.  Semantics

   When the streaming rate needs to be changed due to a target feedback
   local policy, the target feedback first sends BBI message containing
   an updated bandwidth and then the retransmission source proceeds with
   the streaming accordingly.

7.2.2.  Format

   The Burst Bandwidth Indication uses additional FCI fields, the
   content of which are depicted in Figure 4.  The length of the FB
   message MUST be set to 3+n, with n being the number of 32-bit words
   comprising the "Extensions" contained in the BBI field.  If the
   "Extensions" does not fall on a 32-bit boundary, then the last word
   MUST be padded to the boundary using further bits set to 0.

   Bitrate:  32 bits - Bitrate indicated by the sender in bits per
      second - this is the actual bitrate of the RTP stream that
      follows.

   Extensions:  Optional extended parameters encoded using Type/Length/
      Value (TLV) elements as described below:

      Type:  A single-octet identifier that defines the type of the
      parameter represented in this TLV element.

      Length:  A two-octet field that indicates the length of the Value
      field.

      Value:  Variable sized set of octets that contains the specific
      value for the parameter.

7.3.  Synch Completed Indication (SCI)

   The SCI FB message is identified by PT=RTPFB and FMT=4.

   There MUST be exactly one SCI contained in the FCI field.

7.3.1.  Semantics

   The receiver sends this indication to the feedback target to indicate
   that the burst stream can be terminated.

7.3.2.  Format

   The Synch Completed Indication uses additional FCI fields, the
   content of which are depicted in Figure 5.  The length of the FB
   message MUST be set to 2+n, with n being the number of 32-bit words
   comprising the "Extensions" contained in the SCI field.  If the
   "Extensions" does not fall on a 32-bit boundary, then the last word
   MUST be padded to the boundary using further bits set to 0.

      Value (TLV) elements as described below:

      Type:  A single-octet identifier that defines the type of the
      parameter represented in this TLV element.

8.  Establishing the Retransmission RTP Session with Burst using SDP

   This section will specify one of the possible ways to use an "out-of-
   band" signaling to establish the retransmission RTP Session with
   burst as defined in this document.

   One method is to use the SDP definitions introduced in "RTP
   Retransmission Payload Format" [RFC4588] and "RTCP Extensions for
   Single-Source Multicast Sessions with Unicast Feedback"
   [I-D.ietf-avt-rtcpssm], and new SDP attributes (if needed) for the
   burst mechanism defined in this document.


9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  New Transport Layer Feedback Messages

   Three new RTCP Transport Layer Feedback Messages will be registered
   through this document: "Lack of Synch Indication" (LSI), "Burst
   Bandwidth Indication" (BBI), and "Synch Completed Indication" (SCI).

9.2.  New SDP attributes

   New SDP attributes will be registered through this document (if
   needed) for the "out-of-band" signaling specific to the mechanism
   defined in this document.


10.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations presented in "Why RTP Does Not Mandate a
   Single Security Mechanism" [I-D.ietf-avt-srtp-not-mandatory] apply to
   the mechanism defined in this document.

   The new protocols' extensions don't introduce security considerations
   beyond those presented in "RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time
   Applications" [RFC3550], "RTCP-Based Feedback" [RFC4585] and "RTCP
   Extensions for Single-Source Multicast Sessions with Unicast
   Feedback" [I-D.ietf-avt-rtcpssm].

   The normal RTP security mechanism (defined in Section 9 of "RTP: A
   Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications" [RFC3550]) and
   "Extended Secure RTP Profile for RTCP-Based Feedback" [RFC5124] apply
   to the extensions defined in this document.
