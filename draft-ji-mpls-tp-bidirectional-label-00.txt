                 Bidirectional Label Assignment in MPLS-TP
                  draft-ji-mpls-tp-bidirectional-label-00


Abstract

   This document describes a new mechanism for the label allocation of
   co-routed bidirectional point-to-point paths in MPLS Transport
   Profile (MPLS-TP) networks, which is called the bidirectional label
   allocation mechanism. The nodes on co-routed bidirectional point-to-
   point paths will not need to record the label pairing relationship of
   the forward and the backward directions in this mechanism because the
   labels are symmetrical. In addition, the compression of the LIB
   becomes possible because of the existing of symmetrical elements.

1. Introduction

   This document describes a new mechanism for the label allocation of
   co-routed bidirectional point-to-point paths in MPLS Transport
   Profile (MPLS-TP) networks.

   It is required that all nodes on the path of a co-routed
   bidirectional transport path in the same (sub)layer as the path MUST
   be aware of the pairing relationship of the forward and the backward
   directions of the transport path in 2.1 General Requirements 10 of
   RFC 5654 [RFC5654]. This requires that each node records the pairing
   relationship, and thus needs to take up additional memories.

   This document uses a bidirectional label allocation mechanism to
   solve the problem. In this mechanism, labels of the forward and the
   backward directions are set to be symmetrical to each other and thus
   get the pairing relationship by nature.

2. Bidirectional Label Allocation Mechanism

   The mechanism described in this document is based on RSVP-TE defined
   in RFC 3209 [RFC3209] and RSVP-TE extensions defined in RFC 3471 and
   RFC 3473 [RFC3471] [RFC3473].

   A simple method for the co-routed bidirectional point-to-point path
   establishment is to set up two unidirectional paths independently
   according to the mechanism in RFC 3209.

   An Upstream Label is introduced for the bidirectional LSP setup
   mechanism in RFC 3471. The downstream and upstream paths are built
   together using a single set of signaling messages in the mechanism.
   The mechanism reduces the setup latency to essentially one initiator-
   terminator round trip time plus processing time, and limits the
   control overhead to the same number of messages as an unidirectional
   LSP.

   The new mechanism in this document also only needs one round time by
   the using of the similar method described in RFC 3471. However, the
   label assignments in the downstream and upstream paths in the new
   mechanism are in the same time, and the labels for the two paths are
   symmetrical as described in Figure 1. The traditional method will
   assign the downstream and upstream label independently.

   Figure 1 Comparing Symmetrical LSP Labels with Independent LSP Labels

   In Figure 1, traditional methods build independent LSP labels
   separately according to RFC 3209 or at one round according to RFC
   3471, and the bidirectional label method builds symmetrical LSP
   labels at one round.

   The new method builds the backward path LSP label besides building
   the forward path LSP label comparing to the method of RFC 3209. The
   label carried in Resv message is stored in the Label Information Base
   (LIB) as the outgoing label for the forward path and as the incoming
   label for the backward path.

   The Upstream Label need not be used in the new mechanism because only
   one label from the downstream node is required for LSPs of both
   directions.

   The new mechanism requires the label allocation result to be
   symmetrical; therefore, there is a certain possibility of the label
   provided by the downstream node is occupied in the upstream node when
   it is using the per platform label space. Using this type of label
   space means that platform-wide incoming labels are used for
   interfaces that can share the same labels [RFC5036].

3. Label Crash

   If the label crash in an upstream node does happen, the node will
   generate a PathErr/NOTIFICATION message with an "Unacceptable label
   value" indication for the downstream node. The downstream node that
   provided the unsuitable label is required to resend another label
   chosen at random from the available label space. If the new label
   received at the second time also causes a label crash, the upstream
   node will send the message described above again until receiving an
   acceptable label. The loop time could be restricted to a certain
   number to avoid the infinite loop.

   An Acceptable Label Set object described in RFC 3471 could be
   included in the PathErr/NOTIFICATION message to indicate which labels
   would be acceptable. It is useful for the node to receive an
   acceptable label.

   In fact, this situation does not happen normally unless the number of
   the available labels is limited to a small amount. The number of the
   available labels is very large in MPLS [RFC3032]. The probability of
   the label crash is very low in a certain network layer if every label
   is chosen at random. Therefore, our new method does not cause too
   much trouble for the label assignment and is acceptable for the MPLS-
   TP network.

4. Applicability

   The mechanism of this document can be used in the point-to-point co-
   routed bidirectional path of the MPLS-TP network if all LSRs support
   this mechanism.

   This mechanism can be used in a network where different kinds of
   paths coexist because it is only a new label assignment method and
   does not conflict with the fundamental forwarding functions of MPLS.

   The mechanism of this document could also be used in the GMPLS
   networks by the using of the mechanism described in RFC 3471, such as
   Label Set object.

5. Security Considerations

   Security considerations discussed in RFC 3209, RFC 3471, and RFC 3473
   apply to this document.

6. IANA Considerations

   This document requires defining an LSR initialization parameter to
   indicate if this mechanism is supported.
