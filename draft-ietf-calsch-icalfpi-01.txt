Abstract

   The IETF has defined a standard format for exchanging calendaring and
   scheduling data, called iCalendar. This format is useful for exchange
   of personal calendar data across the Internet, as well as in non-
   Internet environments.

   In a number of environments where the iCalendar will be used, the
   format type and version needs to be identified. For example, when
   registering the iCalendar as a format for memory-based "clipboard" or
   "drag/drop" user interface interactions. For these cases, a
   definitive formal public identifier (FPI) for the iCalendar will be
   required. This memo defined the FPI to be used when referring to the
   version 2.0 (the value in the "VERSION" property) of the iCalendar
   format.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC 2119].

1.      Introduction

   This memo defines a FPI for iCalendar. The format corresponds to the
   version defined by the [RFC 2445] specification and identified in an

   iCalendar object by the "VERSION:2.0" property:value pair. An FPI is
   an identifier that is used to uniquely identify an entity. The syntax
   for a FPI is defined in [ISO 9070].

   The FPI defined by this memo can be used to register the version 2.0
   of the iCalendar format in an operating system object registry so
   that the format can be uniquely referenced within that environment.
   In addition, this FPI can be used to refer to the iCalendar notation
   in representation grammars, such as that defined by [XML].

2.      iCalendar v2.0 FPI

   The public identified defined by this memo is a non-registered FPI,
   as defined by [ISO 9070]. The FPI is defined by the following text
   string.

        "-//IETF//NOTATION RFC 2445/iCalendar//EN"

   This FPI SHOULD be used where ever a reference is needed to the
   standard iCalendar format defined by [RFC 2445]. For example, the
   following shows how it would be used in an XML notation declaration:

        <!NOTATION iCalendar PUBLIC
        "-//IETF//NOTATION RFC 2445/iCalendar//EN">
