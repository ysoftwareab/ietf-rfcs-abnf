2.  Abstract

This document describes the information to be included in the standard
phone book for roaming applications.  All data is described in XML [5]
(Extensible Markup Language) syntax leading to a concise XML DTD
(Document Type Declaration) for the phone book.  Goals of this document
include:

   - Creating a flexible, extensible and robust framework
     upon which to build a standard phone book
   - Promoting a standard phone book format, to enhance
     interoperability between ISPs and roaming consortia

Non-goals of this document include:

   - Attempting to create a "Swiss army knife", with phone
     book elements to please everyone on Earth
   - Definition of either server-server or client-server
     phone book update or transfer protocols


3.  Rationale for XML Usage

XML is rapidly becoming a standard format for data exchange between
different applications also taking into account the transfer and access
of data over the web. XML is used as syntax for expressing the structure
and content of a roaming phone book to enable widespread usage and
access to many different kind of media (e.g. paper, CDROM, www) using a
widespread selection of access devices. Furthermore XML enables:

   - Extensibility
   - Flexibility
   - Integration with directories

Extensibility is important because phone books are living documents; as
such, it is unlikely that all the semantic requirements of arbitrary
Internet service providers (ISPs) would be met by a fixed scheme, no
matter how well thought out.  Phone book designers must be free to
create new attributes in a well-understood fashion to meet changing
business needs.

Flexibility is required of the attribute definition syntax for many of
the same reasons that semantic extensibility is necessary. If we assume
that phone book designers may need to define elements of arbitrary type,
the syntax chosen must be able to represent these data objects cleanly.
Using XML for describing the data content of the phone book fits this
bill nicely, since it can be used to unambiguously describe virtually
any data type.

Integration with directories: although it is unlikely that phone books
will be stored in the directory due to performance considerations, the
creation of a XML DTD describing phone book content leaves that option
open, with relatively little incremental effort required to implement
it.


4.  Specification of Requirements

In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST, "MUST NOT", "optional",
"recommended", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT", are to be interpreted as
described in [1].

5.  Value type notations for 'stronger' typing

XML does not have capabilities for 'strong typing' of the content of
elements. The only type definition foreseen in the base specification is
"#PCDATA", 'parseable character data' comprising everything.
To enable a more concise description of the content of particular
elements several value type notations are introduced. This allows for a
more detailed type description of the content of elements.

This document includes definitions of the following components:

   - Phone Book
   - Provider
   - POP
   - Support

   book as a whole), a phone book name and one or more references to POP
   objects.  A Phone Book element may also contain multiple references
   to Provider and Setup elements (described below).

6.5.  Setup

6.5.1.  Description
   The Setup element includes child elements which describe services
   which may change from provider to provider or even from POP to POP.

7.1.1.  Phone Book Version

7.1.1.1.  Description
   The phoneBookVersion attribute is an integer representing the version
   of the phone book; it is a monotonically increasing counter which
   should be incremented each time the phone book is modified.  This
   element can be used by a server to help decide what (if any) actions
   are required to bring a client's phone book up to date.  For example,
   the client can, at connect time, send an update request to the server
   including in the request the version number of its current phone

   book.  If the client's phone book version is not the same as the
   server's current phone book version, the server can easily take
