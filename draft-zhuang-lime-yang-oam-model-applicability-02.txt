Abstract

   A generic YANG data model for Operations, Administration, and
   Maintenance (OAM) has been defined in [GENYANGOAM], with the
   intention that technology-specific extensions will be developed to be
   able reference/use the Generic YANG model.  In this document, we
   describe the applicability of the generic YANG OAM data model to
   specific OAM technologies.  To be concrete, we also demonstrate the
   usability and extensibility of the generic YANG OAM model with OAM
   protocols such as IP Ping, traceroute, BFD and MPLS LSP Ping.

1.  Introduction

   The Generic YANG [RFC6020] over NETCONF [RFC6241] data model for OAM
   defined in [GENYANGOAM], aims at providing consistent configuration,
   reporting and representation of OAM mechanisms at any layer for any
   technology.

   In this document, we discuss the applicability of the generic YANG
   OAM model to various OAM technologies and demonstrates that the YANG
   model(s) developed in the LIME WG are usable and extensible for those
   technologies.  The demonstration uses IP Ping, traceroute, BFD and
   LSP Ping as specific examples.

            Figure 1: Structure of the Generic LIME Base Model

   The generic YANG OAM model comprises three definitions for
   configuration and operational state data:

   o  configuration model definition;

   o  Remote procedure call (RPC) definition;

   o  and notification definition.

   The configuration model definition provides hierarchical structure to
   describe fault domain (i.e., maintenance domain), test point (i.e.,
   maintenance point), technology type, layering, and session context
   for trouble-shooting.  This basic configuration model enables users
   to select corresponding layers and nodes serving as anchor points to
   define their specific technology OAM YANG models.

Internet-Draft      Applicability of LIME Base Model       December 2015


   The RPC definition provides uniform APIs for common OAM functions
   such as continuity check, connectivity verification, path discovery,
   performance measurement and their equivalents.  These APIs are used
   by the network management system (NMS) to control OAM tools and
   functionalities on network elements for measuring and monitoring the
   data plane (e.g., LSP Ping, IP performance measurement protocol) and
   troubleshooting (e.g., fault localization).  These OAM tools
   activation can be pro-active and on-demand.

   The notification definition also provides a uniform API to report
   defects, faults, and network failures at different layers.  This API
   is used by network elements to report to the network management
   system (NMS).  The content of each notification includes the fault
   domain and the test point(s) that detected the fault and may generate
   the error message.  This API must be activated proactively.

3.1.  Performance Management Support

   To support OAM Performance Management, the generic YANG Data Model
   for OAM needs to be extended by adding loss and delay measurements
   support with the following model structure:

   /* MEP Configuration extension */
    augment /goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA/goam:MEP:
       +--rw delay-measurements?
     augment /goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA/goam:MEP:
       +--rw loss-measurements?
   /* New rpcs */
   rpcs:
     +---x create-loss-measurement
     |     ...
     +---x abort-loss-measurement
     |     ...
     +---x create-delay-measurement
     |     ...
     +---x abort-delay-measurement
     |     ...

   Both pro-active and on-demand loss and delay measurement are
   supported by augument MEP configuration and RPCs with session type
   parameter.  The details of Performance management extension is
   specified in the [I-D.wang-lime-yang-pm]

4.  Guidelines For Extending the LIME Base Data Model

   YANG allows a module to reference external modules to reuse data
   already defined in those modules.  Therefore a technology-specific
   model can import data definitions from the LIME base model.



Taylor & Zhuang           Expires June 13, 2016                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft      Applicability of LIME Base Model       December 2015


   The import statements are used to make definitions available inside
   other modules [RFC6020].  Users who want to develop a technology-
   specific OAM model should import the ietf-gen-oam YANG model with the
   following statements:

      module example-ietf-xxx-oam {
              namespace "urn:foo:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-xxx-oam";
              prefix xxxoam;

              import ietf-gen-oam {
                prefix goam;
              }
              ......

   As described in Section 3, the LIME base model provides a
   hierarchical structure for configuration, notification and RPCs.
   Each of these three aspects should be extended with technology-
   specific features and parameters relating to each technology of
   interest.

   YANG allows a module to insert additional nodes into data models,
   including both the current module (and its submodules) or an external
   module.  This is useful to let specific technologies add specific
   parameters into the LIME base model.

   Here we summarize four ways to extend the LIME base model for
   specific technologies:

   o  Extend structure for configuration with technology specific
      parameters

   o  Extend structure for notification with technology specific
      parameters

   o  Extend structure for RPC with technology specific parameters

   o  Define new RPCs and notifications in the technology specific OAM
      data model.

4.1.  Extend configuration structure with technology specific parameters

   As described in [RFC6020], the "augment" statement defines the
   location in the data model hierarchy where new nodes are inserted.

   By using the "augment" statement, the hierarchy of configuration
   structure can be extended with new data nodes that express
   technology-specific parameters to meet the requirements of the
   respective technologies.  The technology-specific model developer

Internet-Draft      Applicability of LIME Base Model       December 2015


   must take care to select the right layers and nodes in the
   configuration structure as anchor points to insert these additional
   data.

   For example, assume a technology- specific OAM YANG model A.  An "a"
   node needs to be inserted within the MA (Maintenance Association):

      augment /goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA:
                +--a?   foo

      Corresponding YANG encoding:

      augment "/goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA"{
               leaf a{
                type foo
                 description
                 "foo";
       }
      }

   There are the following five levels in the hierarchy of configuration
   structure which we can choose as anchor point to insert additional
   data definitions:

   o  Maintenance domain (MD) at the root level;

   o  Maintenance Association (MA) at the second level;

   o  Maintenance Association Endpoint (MEP) and Maintenance Association
      Intermediate point(MIP) at the third level;

   o  Session at the fourth level;

   o  Interface at the fifth level;

4.1.1.  Maintenance domain (MD) at the root level

   At the Maintenance Domain level, domain data node at root level can
   be augmented with technology type.  [GENYANGOAM] defines a new
   globally unique, abstract, and untyped "technology-types" base
   identity by using the "identity" statement. "identity" and
   "identityref" are used to Identify New Technology Types.  Each
   technology-specific module then can extend technology type in the
   base model and specifies a corresponding concrete identity using this
   base: ipv4, ipv6, trill, mpls, etc.

Internet-Draft      Applicability of LIME Base Model       December 2015


4.1.2.  Maintenance Association (MA) at the second level

   At the Maintenance Association level, an MA data node can be
   augmented with connectivity context information.  For example:

   +--rw MAs
       +--rw MA* [MA-name-string]
          ...
          +--rw (connectivity-context)?
          |  +--:(context-null)
          |     +--rw context-null?        Empty

      Corresponding YANG encoding:

          choice connectivity-context {
            default "context-null";
            case context-null {
              description
                "this is a place holder when no context is needed";
              leaf context-null {
                type empty;
                description
                  "there is no context defined";
              }
            }
            description
              "connectivity context";
          }

   ietf-gen-oam YANG model users who want to define a specific OAM
   technology model can augment the corresponding choice node by
   defining a new case to carry technology specific extensions.

   For example, for a specific OAM technology YANG model A, an "a" node
   is needed to indicate the connectivity context for this specific OAM
   technology.  To achieve this, it is only necessary to augment the
   connectivity-context choice node in the ietf-gen-OAM YANG model by
   defining a "connectivity-context-A" case as:

      augment /goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA
      /goam:connectivity-context:
            +--:(connectivity-context-A)
               +--a?   foo

      Corresponding YANG encoding:

      augment "/goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA"
      +"/goam:connectivity-context" {
         case connectivity-context-A {
          leaf a{
           type foo;}
          }
         }

   In some case when technology type in the Maintenance Domain level is
   not sufficient to identify OAM technology with different
   encapsulation method, MA data node can be further augmented with
   technology sub type (see an example in the section 5.5).

4.1.3.  Maintenance Association Endpoint (MEP) at the third level

   At the Maintenance Association Endpoint level, a MEP data node can be
   augmented with connectivity-context information, ECMP information and
   session information respectively.

4.1.4.  Session at the fourth level

   At the session level, Session data node can be augmented with
   technology specific information such as Session type, Session
   interval,etc.

4.1.5.  Interface at the fifth level

   At the interface level under MEP/MIP or under session, the interface
   data node can be augmented with technology specific information such
   as context information, interface type,disable/enable button,etc.

4.2.  Extend RPC structure with technology specific parameters

   [GENYANGOAM] defines rpc model which abstracts OAM specific commands
   in a technology independent manner.  In this RPC model, three generic
   RPC commands are specified.  By using the "augment" statement,the RPC
   structure for each OAM command can be extended with new data nodes
   that express technology-specific OAM command parameters to meet the
   requirements of the respective technologies.  The technology-specific
   model developer must take care to select the right layers and nodes

   data.  There are two places which we can choose as anchor point to
   insert additional data definitions:

   o  Input data node

   Input data node can be augmented with technology type, sub-command
   type, session type and other technology specific parameters.  Here is
   an example of sub-command type:

   [GENYANGOAM] defines a "command-sub-type" abstract identity for
   different RPC commands, e.g., to distinguish the types of IP ping
   [RFC792], LSP ping [RFC4379].  Use of this identity is optional for
   most cases.

      The corresponding statements are shown as below.

        identity command-sub-type {
          description
            "defines different rpc command subtypes, e.g rfc792 IP
             ping, rfc4379 LSP ping, this is
             optional for most cases";
        }

        identity icmp-rfc792 {
          base command-sub-type;
          description
            "Defines the command subtypes for ICMPv4 ping";
          reference "RFC 792";
        }

        identity icmp-rfc4443 {
          base command-sub-type;
          description
            "Defines the command subtypes for ICMPv6 ping";
          reference "RFC 4443";
        }

        identity icmp-rfc4379 {
          base command-sub-type;
          description
            "Defines the command subtypes for LSP ping";
          reference "RFC 4379";
        }

   o  Output data node

   Similarly, output data nod can be augmented with technology specific
   test results information collected by executing OAM command.

4.3.  Extend Notification structure with technology specific parameters

   [GENYANGOAM] defines one notification model which abstracts defects
   notification in a technology independent manner.  By using the
   "augment" statement,the notification structure can be extended with
   new data nodes that express technology-specific notification
   parameters to meet the requirements of the respective technologies.
   The technology-specific model developer must take care to select the
   right layers and nodes in the notification structure as anchor points
   to insert these additional data.

4.4.  Define New RPCs and Notifications

   The LIME base model presents three basic RPCs: continuity check,
   connectivity verification and path discovery.  Technology-specific
   OAM models can either extend the existing RPCs and notifications
   defined in the LIME base model or define new RPCs and notifications
   if generic RPCs and notifications cannot be reused to meet their
   requirements.

   For example, a Multicast Tree Verification (MTV) [TRILLOAMYANG] RPC
   command is defined in the TRILL OAM model to verify connectivity as
   well as data-plane and control-plane integrity of TRILL multicast
   forwarding as follows:

      RPCs:
         +---x mtv
            +--ro input
            |  +--ro technology             identityref
            |  +--ro MD-name-string         MD-name-string
            |  +--ro MA-name-string?        MA-name-string
            |  ...
            +--ro output
               +--ro response* [mep-address mep-id]
                  +--ro hop-count?                  uint8
                  +--ro mep-id                      tril-rb-nickname
                  +--ro mep-address                 tril-rb-nickname
                  ...

5.  Applicability of LIME Model to Various Technologies

   As mentioned above, the ietf-gen-oam model describes the abstract
   common core configuration, statistics, RPCs, and notifications for
   layer independent OAM management.

   Following guidelines stated in Section 4, ietf-gen-oam YANG model
   users can augment this base model by defining and adding new data
   nodes with technology specific functions and parameters into proper

   anchor points of the ietf-gen-oam model, so as to develop a
   technology-specific OAM model.

   With these guidelines in hand, this section further demonstrates the
   usability of the ietf-gen-oam YANG model to various OAM technologies.
   Note that, in this section, we only present several snippets of
   technology-specific data model extensions for illustrative purposes.
   The complete model extensions should be worked on in respective
   protocol working groups.

5.1.  Generic YANG Model extension for IP OAM

5.1.1.  MD Configuration Extension

   MD level configuration parameters are management information which
   can be inherited in the TRILL OAM model and set by LIME base model as
   default values.  For example domain name can be set to area-ID in the
   IP OAM case.  In addition, at the Maintenance Domain level, domain
   data node at root level can be augmented with technology type.

   Note that MD level configuration parameters provides context
   information for management system to correlate faults, defects,
   network failures with location information, which helps quickly
   identify root causes of network failures.MD level configuration
   parameters MUST not be carried using IP Ping and traceroute protocol
   since IP Ping and traceroute doesn't support transport of these
   management information.

5.1.1.1.  Technology Type Extension

   The technology types ipv4 and ipv6 have already been defined in the
   LIME base model.  Therefore no technology type extension is required
   in the IP OAM model.

5.1.2.  MA Configuration Extension

   MA level configuration parameters are management information which
   can be inherited in the IP OAM model and set by LIME base model as
   default values.  In addition, at the Maintenance Association(MA)
   level, MA data node at the second level can be augmented with
   connectivity-context extension.

   Note that MA level configuration parameters provides context
   information for management system to correlate faults, defects,
   network failures with location information, which helps quickly
   identify root causes of network failures.MA level configuration
   parameters MUST not be carried using IP Ping and traceroute protocol

Internet-Draft      Applicability of LIME Base Model       December 2015


   since IP Ping and traceroute doesn't support transport of these
   management information.

5.1.2.1.  Connectivity-Context Extension

   In IP OAM, one example of the connectivity-context is a 12 bit VLAN
   ID.  The LIME base model defines a placeholder for connectivity-
   context.  This allows other technologies to easily augment it to
   include technology specific extensions.  The snippet below depicts an
   example of augmenting context-id to include VLAN ID.

   augment /goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA
   /goam:MEP/goam:connectivity-context:
      +--:(context-id-vlan)
         +--rw context-id-vlan?   vlan
   augment /goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA/goam:MEP
   /goam:session/goam:connectivity-context:
      +--:(context-id-vlan)
         +--rw context-id-vlan?   vlan

5.1.3.  MEP Configuration Extension

   MEP configuration in the LIME base model already supports configuring
   the interface on which the MEP is located with an IP address.  There
   is no additional MEP configuration extension needed for IP OAM.

   However, IP Ping, traceroute do not use the MEPID in their message
   headers.  Therefore it is important to have method to derive the
   MEPID in an automatic manner with no user intervention.

5.1.3.1.  ECMP extension

   The flow-entropy parameter in the LIME OAM configuration model is an
   optional parameter.  Since standard IP OAM protocols, e.g., IP Ping
   and Traceroute, don't support ECMP path selection, the flow-entropy
   parameter does not need to be supported in the IP OAM model.

5.1.4.  RPC Extension

   Technology type in the RPC definition has already been defined in the
   LIME OAM base model.  Therefore no technology type extension is
   required in the RPC definition.  For IP OAM, IP Ping and IP
   Traceroute RPCs need to be supported.  For the IP OAM model, the
   continuity-check RPC with IPv4 or IPv6 as technology type can be
   mapped to the IP Ping RPC, while the path-discovery RPC with IPv4 or
   IPv6 as technology type can be mapped to IP Traceroute.

Internet-Draft      Applicability of LIME Base Model       December 2015


5.1.5.  Performance Monitoring Extension

   Editor Note: IP performance measurement (IPPM) and IP Ping and
   Traceroute are discussed separately based on the [RFC7276]
   classification of OAM technologies.  Although IPPM and IP OAM are
   both applied to the IP network, based on Table 4 of [RFC7276], IP OAM
   does not support performance measurement.  It is necessary to use
   OWAMP and TWAMP, defined in IPPM, for that purpose.

5.1.5.1.  MEP PM Configuration Extension

   To support IP performance measurement, MEP configuration in the LIME
   base model can be extended with:

   o  loss-stats-group: grouping object for loss measurement session
      statistics.

   o  measurement-timing-group: grouping object used for proactive and
      on-demand scheduling of PM measurement sessions.

   o  delay-measurement-configuration-group: grouping configuration
      object for the delay measurement function.

   o  delay-measurement-stats-group: grouping object for delay
      measurement session statistics.

   o  loss-measurement-configuration-group: grouping configuration
      object for the loss measurement function.

   o  loss-measurement-stats-group: grouping object for loss measurement
      session statistics.

5.1.5.2.  RPC PM Extension

   To support IP performance measurement, it is recommended that four
   RPCs are defined in the IPPM model:

   o  create-loss-measurement RPC: allows scheduling of one-way or two-
      way on-demand or proactive performance monitoring loss measurement
      sessions.

   o  abort-loss-measurement RPC: allows aborting of currently running
      or scheduled loss measurement session.

   o  create-delay-measurement RPC: allows scheduling of one-way or two-
      way on-demand or proactive performance monitoring delay
      measurement sessions.

   o  abort-delay-measurement RPC: allows aborting of currently running
      or scheduled delay measurement sessions.

5.2.  Generic YANG Model extension for TRILL OAM

5.2.1.  MD Configuration Extension

   MD level configuration parameters are management information which
   can be inherited in the TRILL OAM model and set by LIME base model as
   default values.  For example domain name can be set to area-ID in the
   TRILL OAM case.  In addition, at the Maintenance Domain level, domain
   data node at root level can be augmented with technology type.

   Note that MD level configuration parameters provides context
   information for management system to correlate faults, defects,
   network failures with location information, which helps quickly
   identify root causes of network failures.

5.2.1.1.  Technology Type Extension

   No TRILL technology type has been defined in the LIME base model.
   Therefore a technology type extension is required in the TRILL OAM
   model.  The technology type "trill" is defined as an identity that
   augments the base "technology-types" defined in the LIME base model:

   identity trill{
    base goam:technology-types;
    description
     "trill type";
   }

5.2.2.  MA Configuration Extension

   MA level configuration parameters are management information which
   can be inherited in the TRILL OAM model and set by LIME base model as
   default values.  In addition, at the Maintenance Association(MA)
   level, MA data node at the second level can be augmented with
   connectivity-context extension.

   Note that MA level configuration parameters provides context
   information for management system to correlate faults, defects,
   network failures with location information, which helps quickly
   identify root causes of network failures.

Internet-Draft      Applicability of LIME Base Model       December 2015


5.2.2.1.  Connectivity-Context Extension

   In TRILL OAM, one example of connectivity-context is either a 12 bit
   VLAN ID or a 24 bit Fine Grain Label.  The LIME base model defines a
   placeholder for context-id.  This allows other technologies to easily
   augment that to include technology specific extensions.  The snippet
   below depicts an example of augmenting connectivity-context to
   include either VLAN ID or Fine Grain Label.

   augment /goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs
   /goam:MA /goam:connectivity-context:
         +--:(connectivity-context-vlan)
         |  +--rw connectivity-context-vlan?   vlan
         +--:(connectivity-context-fgl)
            +--rw connectivity-context-fgl?    fgl

   augment /goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA/goam:MEP
   /goam:session/goam:connectivity-context:
         +--:(connectivity-context-vlan)
         |  +--rw connectivity-context-vlan?   vlan
         +--:(connectivity-context-fgl)
            +--rw connectivity-context-fgl?    fgl

5.2.3.  MEP Configuration Extension

   The MEP configuration definition in the LIME base model already
   supports configuring the interface of MEP with either MAC address or
   IP address.  In addition, the MEP address can be represented using a
   2 octet RBridge Nickname in TRILL OAM . Hence, the TRILL OAM model
   augments the MEP configuration in base model to add a nickname case
   into the MEP address choice node as follows:

   augment /goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs
   /goam:MA/ goam:MEP/goam:mep-address:
         +--:( mep-address-trill)
         |  +--rw mep-address-trill?  tril-rb-nickname

   In addition, at the Maintenance Association Endpoint(MEP) level, MEP
   data node at the third level can be augmented with ECMP extension.

5.2.3.1.  ECMP Extension

   The flow-entropy parameter in the LIME base model is an optional
   parameter.  Since TRILL supports ECMP path selection, flow-entropy in
   TRILL is defined as a 96 octet field.  The snippet below illustrates
   its extension.

         +--:(flow-entropy-trill)
            +--rw flow-entropy-trill?   flow-entropy-trill

5.2.4.  RPC Extension

   In the TRILL OAM YANG model, the continuity-check and path-discovery
   RPC commands are extended with TRILL specific requirements.  The
   snippet below illustrates the TRILL OAM RPC extension.

   augment /goam:continuity-check/goam:input:
         +--ro (out-of-band)?
         |  +--:(ipv4-address)
         |  |  +--ro ipv4-address?      inet:ipv4-address

5.2.5.  Performance Management (PM) Extension

5.2.5.1.  MEP PM Configuration Extension

   To support performance measurement for TRILL, MEP configuration in
   the LIME base model can be extended with:

   o  loss-stats-group: grouping statistics object for TRILL Loss
      measurement sessions;

   o  measurement-timing-group: grouping object used for proactive and
      on-demand scheduling of PM measurement sessions;

   o  delay-measurement-configuration-group: grouping configuration
      object for TRILL delay measurement function;

   o  delay-measurement-stats-group: grouping statistics object for
      TRILL delay measurement sessions.

5.2.5.2.  RPC PM Extension

   To support performance measurement for TRILL, it is recommended that
   four new RPCs are defined in the TRILL OAM PM model:

   o  create-loss-measurement RPC: allows scheduling of one-way or two-
      way on-demand or proactive performance monitoring loss measurement
      sessions.

   o  abort-loss-measurement RPC: allows aborting of currently running
      or scheduled loss measurement sessions.

   o  create-delay-measurement RPC: allows scheduling of one-way or two-
      way on-demand or proactive performance monitoring delay
      measurement sessions.

   o  abort-delay-measurement RPC: allows aborting of currently running
      or scheduled delay measurement sessions.

5.2.6.  Usage example

   This part gives a simple example of implementing the TRILL OAM model
   onto network devices.

   The scenario is shown in Figure 2, in which there are two companies:
   A and B.  Both have departments in City 1 and City 2.  Meanwhile,
   different departments within the same company should be able to
   communicate with each other.  However, the communication services of
   these two companies should be separated from each other.

   To meet the requirements above, two Ethernet Lease line, E-Line-1 and

   traffic between two companies.  VLAN 100 associates port 3-EFF8-1 of
   NE1 facing with company A while VLAN 200 associates port 3-EF8-2 of
   NE1 facing with company B.  For network maintenance, NE1, NE2 and NE3
   are within a same maintenance domain: MD1.  Two maintenance
   associations MA1 and MA2 are configured and stand for E-Line-1 and

   MAC-FOO2, MAC-FOO3 respectively.

5.2.6.1.  TRILL OAM Extension

   To fulfill the TRILL OAM configuration, the LME base model should be
   extended by augmenting the connectivity-context and inserting a port
   node in the MEP list.  The snippet below illustrates an example of

5.3.  Generic YANG Model extension for MPLS OAM

5.3.1.  MD Configuration Extension

   MD level configuration parameters are management information which
   can be inherited in the MPLS OAM model and set by LIME base model as
   default values.  For example domain name can be set to area-ID in the
   MPLS OAM case.  In addition, at the Maintenance Domain level, domain
   data node at root level can be augmented with technology type and
   sub-technology type.

   Note that MD level configuration parameters provides context
   information for management system to correlate faults, defects,
   network failures with location information, which helps quickly
   identify root causes of network failures.  MD level configuration
   parameters MUST not be carried using MPLS OAM protocol(e.g., LSP
   Ping) since MPLS OAM protocol doesn't support transport of these
   management information.

5.3.1.1.  Technology Type Extension

   No MPLS technology type has been defined in the LIME base model,
   hence it is required in the MPLS OAM model.  The technology type
   "mpls" is defined as an identity that augments the base "technology-
   types" defined in the LIME base model:

      identity mpls{
       base goam:technology-types;
       description
        "mpls type";
      }

5.3.1.2.  Sub Technology Type Extension

   In MPLS, since different encapsulation types such as IP/UDP
   Encapsulation, PW-ACH encapsulation can be employed, the "technology-
   sub-type" data node is defined and added into the MPLS OAM model to

   further identify the encapsulation types within the MPLS OAM model.
   Based on it, we also define a technology sub-type for IP/UDP
   encapsulation and PW-ACH encapsulation.  Other Encapsulation types
   can be defined in the same way.

      identity technology-sub-type {
                description
                  "certain implementations can have different
                   encapsulation types such as ip/udp, pw-ach and so on.
                   Instead of defining separate models for each
                   encapsulation, we define a technology sub-type to
                   further identify different encapsulations. Technology
                   sub-type is associated at the MA level";
              }

           identity technology-sub-type-udp {
             base technology-sub-type;
             description
               "technology sub-type is IP/UDP encapsulation";
           }

           identity technology-sub-type-ach {
             base technology-sub-type;
             description
               "technology sub-type is PW-ACH encapsulation";
           }
           }

      augment "/goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA" {
             leaf technology-sub-type {
               type identityref {
                 base technology-sub-type;
               }
             }
           }

5.3.2.  MA Configuration Extension

   MA level configuration parameters are management information which
   can be inherited in the MPLS- OAM model and set by LIME base model as
   default values.  In addition, at the Maintenance Association(MA)
   level, MA data node at the second level can be augmented with
   connectivity-context extension.

   Note that MA level configuration parameters provides context
   information for management system to correlate faults, defects,
   network failures with location information, which helps quickly
   identify root causes of network failures.  MA level configuration

   parameters MUST not be carried using MPLS OAM protocol(e.g., LSP
   Ping) since MPLS OAM protocol doesn't support transport of these
   management information.

5.3.2.1.  Connectivity-Context Extension

   In MPLS, one example of context-id is a 20 bit MPLS label.  The LIME
   base model defines a placeholder for context-id.  This allows other
   technologies to easily augment that to include technology specific
   extensions.  The snippet below depicts an example of augmenting
   context-id to include per VRF MPLS labels in IP VPN or per CE MPLS
   labels in IP VPN.

   augment "/goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA
   /goam:connectivity-context"
            {
              case connectivity-context-mpls {
                 leaf vrf-label {
                   type vrf-label;
                 }
               }
            }

5.3.3.  MEP Configuration Extension

   In MPLS, the MEP address is either an IPv4 or IPV6 address in case
   IP/UDP encapsulation.  MEP-ID is either a 2 octet unsigned integer
   value in case IP/UDP encapsulation or a variable length label value
   in case of G-ACH encapsulation.  In the LIME base model, MEP-ID is
   defined as a variable length label value and the same definition can
   be used for MPLS with no further modification.  In addition, at the
   Maintenance Association Endpoint(MEP) level, MEP data node at the
   third level can be augmented with Session extension and interface
   extension.

5.3.3.1.  ECMP Extension

   Since MPLS supports ECMP path selection, the flow-entropy should be
   defined in MPLS OAM model.  Technology type is used to extend the
   YANG model to specific usage.

              type flow-entropy-mpls;

   To support performance monitoring for MPLS, MEP configuration in the
   LIME base model can be extended with:

   o  TBC.

5.3.5.2.  RPC Extension

   To support performance monitoring for MPLS, it is recommended that
   five new RPCs are defined in the MPLS OAM PM model:

   o  MPLS Direct Loss Measurement (DLM) RPC [RFC6374];

   o  MPLS Inferred Loss Measurement (ILM) RPC [RFC6374];

   o  MPLS Delay Measurement (DM) RPC [RFC6374];

   o  MPLS Direct Loss and Delay Measurement RPC [RFC6374];

   o  MPLS Inferred Loss and Delay Measurement RPC [RFC6374].

5.3.6.  Usage Example

   In the MPLS tunnel scenario (see Figure 3): tunnel_1 is a static LSP
   tunnel passing through NE1-NE2-NE4.  It is used to perform LSP PING.
   tunnel_3 is another static LSP tunnel passing through NE4-NE2-NE1,
   used to bring back the LSP PING result.  tunnel_2 is a third static
   LSP tunnel passing through NE1-NE3-NE4, used to perform LSP
   Traceroute. tunnel_4 is a fourth static LSP tunnel passing through
   NE4-NE3-NE1, used to bring back the LSP Traceroute result.

5.4.  Generic YANG Model extension for MPLS-TP OAM

5.4.1.  MD Configuration Extension

   MD level configuration parameters are management information which
   can be inherited in the MPLS-TP OAM model and set by LIME base model
   as default values.  For example domain name can be set to area-ID or
   the provider's Autonomous System Number (ASN) [RFC6370] in the MPLS-
   TP OAM case.  In addition, at the Maintenance Domain level, domain
   data node at root level can be augmented with technology type and
   sub-technology type.

   Note that MD level configuration parameters provides context
   information for management system to correlate faults, defects,
   network failures with location information, which helps quickly
   identify root causes of network failures

5.4.1.1.  Technology Type Extension

   No MPLS-TP technology type has been defined in the LIME base model,
   hence it is required in the MPLS OAM model.  The technology type
   "mpls-tp" is defined as an identity that augments the base
   "technology- types" defined in the LIME base model:

    identity mpls-tp{
          base goam:technology-types;
          description
           "mpls-tp type";
         }

5.4.1.2.  Sub Technology Type Extension

   In MPLS-TP, since different encapsulation types such as IP/UDP
   Encapsulation, PW-ACH encapsulation can be employed, the "technology-
   sub-type" data node is defined and added into the MPLS OAM model to
   further identify the encapsulation types within the MPLS-TP OAM
   model.  Based on it, we also define a technology sub-type for IP/UDP
   encapsulation and PW-ACH encapsulation.  Other Encapsulation types
   can be defined in the same way.

   Section ID or MEG PW ID[RFC6370].  In addition, at the Maintenance

                    }
                  }
               }

5.4.3.  MEP Configuration Extension

   In MPLS-TP, MEP-ID is either a variable length label value in case of
   G-ACH encapsulation or a 2 octet unsigned integer value in case of
   IP/UDP encapsulation.  One example of MEP-ID is MPLS-TP LSP_MEP_ID
   [RFC6370].  In case of using IP/UDP encapsulation, the MEP address
   can be either an IPv4 or IPV6 address.  In the LIME base model, MEP-
   ID is defined as a variable length label value and the same
   definition can be used for MPLS-TP with no further modification.  In
   addition, at the Maintenance Association Endpoint(MEP) level, MEP
   data node at the third level can be augmented with Session extension
   and interface extension.

5.4.3.1.  ECMP Extension

   The flow-entropy parameter in the LIME OAM configuration model is an
   optional parameter.  Standard MPLS-TP OAM protocol does not support
   ECMP path selection, so the flow-entropy parameter does not need to
   be supported in the MPLS-TP OAM model.

   o  TBC.

5.4.5.2.  RPC Extension

   To support performance monitoring for MPLS-TP, it is recommended that
   five new RPCs are defined in the MPLS OAM PM model:

   o  MPLS-TP Test Message RPC [RFC6375];

   o  MPLS-TP Delay Measurement(DM) Message RPC [RFC6375];

5.5.  Generic YANG Model extension for NVO3 OAM

5.5.1.  Technology Type Extension

   No NVO3 technology type has been defined in the LIME base model.
   Therefore technology type extension is required in the NVO3 OAM
   model.  The technology type "nvo3" is defined as an identity that
   augments the base "technology-types" defined in the LIME base model:

      identity nvo3{
       base goam:technology-types;
       description
        "nvo3 type";
      }

5.5.2.  Sub Technology Type Extension

   In NVO3, since different overlay encapsulation types such as VxLAN,
   NVGRE can be employed, the "technology-sub-type" data node is defined
   and added into the NVO3 OAM model to further identify the overlay
   types within the NVO3 model.  Based on it, we also define a
   technology sub-type for VxLAN encapsulation.  NVGRE and GENEVE, sub-
   types can be defined in the same way.

   identity technology-sub-type {
             description
               "certain implementations such as nvo3 can have different
                encapsulation types such as vxlan, nvgre and so on.
                Instead of defining separate models for each
                encapsulation, we define a technology sub-type to
                further identify different encapsulations. Technology
                sub-type is associated at the MA level";
           }

        identity technology-sub-type-vxlan {
          base technology-sub-type;
          description
            "technology sub-type is vxlan";
        }
   augment "/goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA" {
          leaf technology-sub-type {
            type identityref {
              base technology-sub-type;
            }
          }
        }

5.5.3.  MEP Configuration Extension

   In NVO3, the MEP address is either an IPv4 or IPV6 address.  In the
   LIME base model, MEP address is defined as an IP address and the same
   definition can be used for NVO3 with no further modification.

Internet-Draft      Applicability of LIME Base Model       December 2015


5.5.4.  Connectivity-Context Extension

   In NVO3, one example of context-id is a 24 bit virtual network
   identifier (VNI).  The LIME base model defines a placeholder for
   context-id.  This allows other technologies to easily augment that to
   include technology specific extensions.  The snippet below depicts an
   example of augmenting context-id to include VNI.

   augment "/goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA
   /goam:connectivity-context"
            {
               case connctivity-context-nvo3 {
                 leaf vni {
                   type vni;
                 }
               }
            }

5.5.5.  RPC Extension

   In the NVO3 OAM YANG model, the End-Station-Locator RPC command is
   defined.  This command locates an end-station within the NVO3
   deployment.  [PTT -- what other tools are applicable??? Presumably
   one can use ICMP Ping, LSP Ping for CV, and the PM extensions, per
   RFC 7276 Table 4.]

5.5.6.  ECMP Extension

   In NVO3, flow-entropy depends on the technology sub-type, e.g.,
   VxLAN.  Technology sub-type is used to extend the base model to
   specific usage.  The snippet below illustrates the extension for
   VxLAN.

   augment "/goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA
   /goam:flow-entropy" {
          case flow-entropy-vxlan {
            leaf flags-vxlan {
              type flags-vxlan;
            }
            leaf flow-entropy-vxlan {
              type flow-entropy-vxlan;
            }
          }
        }

5.6.  Generic YANG Model extension for BFD

5.6.1.  MD Level configuration extension

   MD level configuration parameters are management information which
   can be inherited in the BFD model and set by LIME base model as
   default values.  For example domain name can be set to area-ID in the
   BFD case.  In addition, at the Maintenance Domain level, domain data
   node at root level can be augmented with technology type and sub-
   technology type.

   Note that MD level configuration parameters provides context
   information for management system to correlate faults, defects,
   network failures with location information, which helps quickly
   identify root causes of network failures.  MD level configuration
   parameters MUST not be carried using BFD protocol since BFD doesn't
   support transport of these management information.

5.6.1.1.  Technology Type Extension

   No BFD technology type has been defined in the LIME base model.
   Therefore a technology type extension is required in the BFD OAM
   model.  The technology type "bfd" is defined as an identity that
   augments the base "technology-types" defined in the LIME base model:

5.6.1.2.  Sub Technology Type Extension

   In BFD, since different encapsulation types such as IP/UDP
   Encapsulation, PW-ACH encapsulation can be employed.

   In lime-bfd-extension yang data model, we define an identity:
   "technology-sub-type" to further identify the encapsulation types
   within the BFD.  And based on it, we also define four identity
   encapsulation types:

   o  technology-sub-type-sh-udp: technology sub-type is single hop with
      IP/UDP encapsulation;

   o  technology-sub-type-mh-udp: technology sub-type is multiple hop
      with IP/UDP encasulation;

   o  technology-sub-type-sh-ach: technology sub-type is single hop with
      PW-ACH encapsulation;

   o  technology-sub-type-mh-ach: technology sub-type is multiple hop
      with PW-ACH encapsulation;

Internet-Draft      Applicability of LIME Base Model       December 2015


   In MD level, we define a sub-technology leaf with an identityref type
   which base on the technology-sub-type:

      augment "/goam:domains/goam:domain/" {
             leaf sub-technology{
               type identityref {
                 base technology-sub-type;
               }
             }
           }

5.6.2.  MA configuration extension

   MA level configuration parameters are management information which
   can be inherited in the BFD model and set by LIME base model as
   default values.  In addition, at the Maintenance Association(MA)
   level, MA data node at the second level can be augmented with
   connectivity-context extension.

   Note that MA level configuration parameters provides context
   information for management system to correlate faults, defects,
   network failures with location information, which helps quickly
   identify root causes of network failures.  MA level configuration
   parameters MUST not be carried using BFD protocol since BFD doesn't
   support transport of these management information.

5.6.2.1.  Connectivity-Context Extension

   In BFD, one example of context-id is a 32bit local discriminator.
   The LIME base model defines a placeholder for context-id.  This
   allows other technologies to easily augment that to include
   technology specific extensions.  The snippet below depicts an example
   of augmenting context-id to include local discriminator.

   augment "/goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA
     /goam:connectivity-context"
                  {
                    case connectivity-context-bfd {
                       leaf local-discriminator {
                         type local-discriminator;
                       }
                     }
                  }

5.6.3.  MEP configuration extension

   In BFD, the MEP address is either an IPv4 or IPV6 address.  MEP-ID is
   either a 2 octet unsigned integer value or a variable length label
   value.  In the LIME base model, MEP-ID is defined as a variable
   length label value and the same definition can be used for BFD with
   no further modification.  In addition, at the Maintenance Association
   Endpoint(MEP) level, MEP data node at the third level can be
   augmented with Session extension and interface extension.

5.6.3.1.  Session Configuration Extension

   At the Session level, Session data node at the fouth level can be
   augmented with 3 interval parameters and 2 TTL parameters.  In
   [draft-zheng-bfd-yang], source and destination address in the bfd-
   session-cfg can be corresponding to Session configuration extension
   as source MEP and destination MEP.

augment /goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA/goam:MEP/goam:session:
+--rw (interval-config-type)?
|  +--:(tx-rx-intervals)
|  |  +--rw desired-min-tx-interval     uint32
|  |  +--rw required-min-rx-interval    uint32
|  +--:(single-interval)

+--rw tx-ttl?                     ttl
+--rw rx-ttl                      ttl

5.6.3.2.  Interface configuration extension

   At the Interface level, interface data node at the fifth level can be
   augmented with the same parameters defined in per-interface
   configuration of [draft-zheng-bfd-yang].

5.6.3.3.  New Notification definition

   [GENYANGOAM] defines a notification model which abstracts defects
   notification in a technology independent manner.However what BFD is
   required is state change notification, therefore a new notification
   definition can be specified to meet BFD requirement.

   notifications:
      +---n state-change-notification
         +--ro local-discriminator?      uint32
         +--ro remote-discriminator?     uint32
         +--ro new-state?                enumeration
         +--ro state-change-reason?      string
         +--ro time-in-previous-state?   string
         +--ro dest-addr?                inet:ip-address
         +--ro source-addr?              inet:ip-address
         +--ro session-cookie?           leafref
         +--ro technology-sub-type?      identityref
         +--ro interface?                leafref
         +--ro echo-enabled?             boolean

   In this state-change-notification, technology-sub-type is used to
   identify whether the notification is for single hop or multi-hop or
   other types.

6.  Open Issues

      Do we need to specify usage examples for each technology-specific
