Internet-Draft            Mobile LMAP Use Cases                July 2015


1.  Introduction

   Networks and services must accommodate service profiles with
   exponentially increasing mobile traffic.  Such traffic has
   significantly changed the network architectures as well as the way
   the networks are controlled and measured.  The same is true of
   services; service providers have to deal with specific problems
   related to traffic profiles coming from the mobile domain, with
   specific requirements different those of fixed broadband access.

   This draft describes a set of use cases for broadband measurements
   applied to the mobile domain.  Some of these use cases apply to fixed
   networks as well.  The primary aim at this initial stage is to detail
   specific use cases that are important in the mobile domain but may be
   inadvertently overlooked when the primary focus is on fixed
   measurements.  Mobile considerations as documented here may lead to
   an expanded scope for the LMAP Working Group.

   This document is drawn from work done within the IEEE Project
   802.16.3 on "Mobile Broadband Network Performance Measurements"
   [P802.16.3].  That project considers a measurement framework for
   mobile broadband measurement scenarios applicable to multiple
   stakeholders.  Such models support flexible measurements and provide
   the basis for a standardized framework facilitating measurement
   comparison and validation.

3.  Rationale for mobile broadband measurements use cases

   Specifically mobile scenarios for broadband measurements are
   considered here for reasons including the following:

Internet-Draft            Mobile LMAP Use Cases                July 2015


   o  Mobility can be the primary cause of variations of service
      experience over time, with a huge impact on the user's perception

   o  Mobile networks in general are affected by varying radio
      conditions that impact services.  Measuring radio conditions
      together with service indicators can provide a better
      characterization and explanation of user experience.

   o  Roaming scenarios and multiple operators are distinctive of the
      mobile domain.

   Considering specifics of the mobile domain allows completing the
   picture for broadband measurements, leading to generalized
   standardization.  Until the mobile broadband measurements framework
   is standardized,in the effort by each stakeholder to compare network
   performance will continue to be complex as well as difficult to
   ascertain quantitatively or to compare fairly with other results.

Internet-Draft            Mobile LMAP Use Cases                July 2015


6.  Stakeholder: User (individual or enterprise)

   Use cases for the "User (individual or enterprise)" stakeholder
   include the following:

6.1.  Use Case: Use Case: SERVICE CHECK

   Individual or enterprise users are obviously interested in getting
   the best service from the mobile network and from the service
   provider.  The performance measured using specific services can be
   compared by the stakeholders in relation to the measurement
   conditions (operator, radio interface, end service host, type of
   service, location, mobility, etc.).  In some cases, the User is an
   enterprise supporting many individual end user devices over a long
   period of time, over a large geographic region (which may be limited
   to, for example, specific service routes).  Standardized measurements
   could be enable agreement on an SLA between the enterprise and a
   mobile service provider.

   Measurement applications that are useful for these purposes are
   overall data on quality of experience measured by UEs but also
   service measurements geo-located or correlated to time-of-day, time-
   of-week, etc.  Even measurements of changes on a specific network
   behavior or on a specific service can be interesting and aid in
   identification of limitations on a specific network.

   A simple example of network limitation could be the absence of
   connection continuity within a certain geographical location, so
   connections are dropped as soon as the UE moves into a region,
   possibly at predictable times.

6.2.  Use Case: TRENDS

   Analyzing trends is a use case relevant for example to enterprise
   organizations that need to assure certain connection reliability over
   time to their associated or customers.  Checking trends is also
   useful for profiling the customer access and identifying bottlenecks
   in the service or overload conditions.

   An example of such a use case is an enterprise that has to size and
   maintain the network resources for customers accessing its network,
   for example for e-commerce or customer support, and desire to measure
   the service experience of mobile access over time, to identify
   bottleneck conditions.

   Measurement application that can be used for such purposes are
   overall data on quality of experience measured by UEs but also
   service measurements geo-located.  All these measurements have to be

Internet-Draft            Mobile LMAP Use Cases                July 2015


   analyzed as trends over time correlating also with enterprise network
   conditions and host behavior.

6.3.  Use Case: COMPARISON

   An enterprise or individual user could be interested in understand
   the relevance of a specific issue that it is experiencing, is
   comparison with other UEs (perhaps located in the same area) and
   accessing similar services.  This could be used to check, for
   example, UE configuration for correct behavior.  Measurements
   application useful for these purposes could be an enterprise or
   public (anonymous) repository of end-user measurements toward
   specific services, geo-located and providing the type of device as
   possible aggregation criteria for measurements.  Comparison use cases
   are also relevant to inter-comparison of network operators in the
   enterprise's service areas.

7.  Stakeholder: Cellular tower operator

   Use cases for the "Cellular tower operator" stakeholder include the
   following:

7.1.  Use Case: AUTONOMOUS NETWORK PERFORMANCE ACCESS

   A network operator builds and develops new tower sites based
   significantly on customer demand; the operator has good access to
   data regarding such demand.  The success of an access cellular tower
   operator, on the other hand, is dependent on building and developing
   new tower locations for use by multiple network operators, none of
   which may share operational information.  Therefore, a cellular tower
   operator may seek access to a broad set of public mobile
   measurements, possible over a broad set of network operators, in
   order to inform tower development activities that will serve multiple
   network operators, ideally without expensive drive tests.

   Measurement applications useful for these use cases could be the
   quality of experience of the specific network, the network diagnosis
   and the change of operation in the specific network.

7.2.  Use Case: AUTONOMOUS RADIO NETWORK ACCESS

   A cellular tower operator is interested in getting the most from each
   site, checking the correctness of the configuration against the radio
   conditions and suggesting improvements to NO that operate the rest of
   the network.  Getting autonomous access to the end-user experience
   correlated with radio conditions and cell identification helps the
   cell tower operator to be more proactive in suggesting network
   improvements.  Measurements could be also used to suggest migration

Internet-Draft            Mobile LMAP Use Cases                July 2015


   to other radio access technologies and otherwise upgrading the
   cellular site.

   Measurement applications useful for these use cases could be the
   quality of experience of the specific network, the diagnosis of
   problems, and the encouragement of deployment of more efficient radio
   access technologies.

8.  Stakeholder: Wireless carrier / Network operator

   Use cases for the "Wireless carrier/Network operator" include the
   following:

8.1.  Use Case: MOBILITY

   As usual in the mobile domain, it is necessary to characterize the
   broadband services during mobility events.  Such characterization can
   be correlated to specific cells and/or specific services.  The
   adoption of measurements at end user premises can be reused even for
   setting proper values for handover settings.

   This scenario can be useful also for the so-called "Self-Organizing
   Networks" (SON), in which the network automatically sets its
   configuration.  The availability of end user measurements related to
   mobility can be used to check the correctness of SON methodology.

   Measurement applications are quality of experience of a specific
   network, correlated with radio conditions, location information, and
   device information.  All these measurements have the consequence that
   the stakeholder can improve knowledge of its network performance,
   useful also to optimize and design better updates of the network.

   Mobility characterization can be used even to characterize the radio
   access technology behavior during service lifetime.  Such
   characterization could suggest improvements of the mobile network or
   additional features to support better mobility.

8.2.  Use Case: SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT

   The existence of a Service Level Agreement is predicated on an
   understanding between the parties on accurate measurement methods.
   Currently, SLAs are rare in the mobile domain, partially because such
   an understanding is difficult to reach.  Standardized measurements
   will help enable mobile SLAs.

   Checking the Service Level Agreement is needed not only to be sure
   that the contract to customers is satisfied but also could be useful
   to check the performance of different NOs homogeneously.  This could

   imply understanding limitations and trigger analysis to improve the
   core network or redesign radio deployment to make it more efficient
   or to move to new radio access technology.

   Measurement applications include the quality of experience of a
   specific network and also overall data on quality of experience of
   set of networks available to customers.

8.3.  Use Case: RESOURCE USAGE

   Traffic and performance measurements are useful to optimize network
   parameter configuration, feeding optimization systems as in the Self-
   Organizing Networks.  Even if this job is typically done at the
   network level, the availability of the UE perspective can help
   especially for network technologies that do not provide a complete
   reporting of the UE measurements.  For example, spectrum allocation
   and configuration parameters can be modified according to the traffic
   and performance measurements provided by UEs, for example to avoid
   network overload and congestion and reduce loss of radio contact.

   Measurement applications are the quality of experience of a specific
   network and diagnosis of problems in a specific network.

8.4.  Use Case: TEST OF NEW NETWORK EQUIPMENT

   Measurements provided by an end-user can be used to characterize the
   performance changes following new network equipment.

   Aggregated per cell and radio technology, such measurements can
   provide KPIs that can be used to compare the network performance
   before and after new release changes at the access network level,
   from the end user perspective.

   Measurement applications are the quality of experience of a specific
   network and diagnosis of problems in a specific network.

9.  Stakeholder: Researcher

   Use cases for the "Researcher" stakeholder include the following:

9.1.  Use Case: CHECK MODELS

   A researcher can be interested in checking the correctness of some
   hypothesis or theoretical models, starting from in-field data.  For
   example, the statistical model for service request arrival rate by
   customers can be checked against real conditions.  Therefore,
   measurement applications useful for researchers can be quality of
   experience of a specific network or quality of experience on a set of

   networks available to the user.  Other relevant applications include
   improving knowledge of system performance and checking the network
   behavior against theoretical models.

9.2.  Use Case: GET ACCESS TO REAL IN-FIELD DATA

   Another possible use case is getting access to real data in order to
   achieve additional information useful for researchers, as for example
   test set or traffic profiles and consistency.

   Measurement applications useful for this use case are similar to the
   previous one.

10.  Stakeholder: Standards developer

   Use cases for the "Standards developer" include the following:

10.1.  Use Case: METRICS AVAILABILITY

   End user measurements are useful to understand actual mobile
   performance and so make decisions on improved standards based on
   measured facts, as obtained in a standardized manner.  For example,
   latency metrics available on specific radio access technology can
   support upgraded standards.

   Measurement application useful for standards developer can be quality
   of experience of a specific network or comparing measured results
   with theoretical models.

10.2.  Use Case: CHECK OF OPTIONS

   Performance measurements allow comparison of expected results with
   current results, in order to validate technical choices.  An example
   could be the adoption of specific codec for voice or the adoption of
   specific protocols for data services.  Another example is the impact
   of security on performance, because authentication and ciphering
   techniques could affect overall performance.

   Measurement applications include performance assessment, correlated
   to radio, location, and technology details.  Other measurement
   applications include the assessment of technology elements proposed
   during the standard development.

11.  Stakeholder: User device vendor

   Use cases for the "User device vendor" include the following:

Internet-Draft            Mobile LMAP Use Cases                July 2015


11.1.  Use Case: UE CHARACTERIZATION

   User device manufacturers are generally interested in the range of
   possible network performance that their users may experience,
   particularly in correlation to factors such as device features.  Such
   information informs the design decisions of the manufacturer, for
   example providing guidance as to which features will be most relevant
   to user experience.

   User device manufacturers can be interested in the adoption of UE
   broadband measurements to characterize the interoperability of the
   device against real networks.  The adoption of KPIs divided per user
   device is helpful for this type of characterization.  In fact,
   different network settings can be the reason for a variable
   interoperability between the network and the UE.

   So, measurement applications useful for user device vendors can be
   quality of experience of a specific network or quality of experience
   on a set of networks available to the user.

12.  Stakeholder: Application developer

   Use cases for the "Application developer" stakeholder include the
   following:

12.1.  Use Case: APPLICATION CHARACTERIZATION

   Mobile application (app) developers are generally interested in the
   range of possible network performance that their users may
   experience.  Such information informs the design decisions of the
   developers, for example providing guidance as to which app features
   will enhance, or detract from, user experience.

   In case of mobile applications, it is important to characterize how
   well the app is performing through the network.  This
   characterization can be also the trigger for app changes that
   minimize the drawbacks with the network interaction.  It is possible
   for mobile application developers also to include monitoring
   callbacks that can be useful for passive measurements.  Other use
   cases for app developer are a sort of usage profiling, understanding
   when and how much an app is used by customers.  Timing the app's
   access to services from the network is important, for example, to
   correlate usage drop by the user to poor quality of service
   experience.

   Measurement application useful for app developer can be quality of
   experience of a specific network or quality of experience on a set of
   networks available to the user.

13.  Stakeholder: Application service provider

   Use cases for "Mobile application service provider" stakeholder
   include the following:

13.1.  Use Case: MOBILE SERVICE CHARACTERIZATION

   Mobile application service providers are interested in mobile
   broadband measurement characterization, particularly correlating the
   measurements to the specific invoked application.  In fact, the
   service accessed by mobile has to satisfy certain conditions not
   relevant to services accessed from fixed networks.  Assessment is
   possible by measuring the volume of mobile application transactions
   and also by correlating such usage with the actual performance level.
   A consequence of such analysis could be encouragement of users to
   adopt specific radio technologies with some critical mobile apps.

   In case of networks that do not support the bandwidth needed for a
   specific application, it may be useful to trigger modifications
   either in the application itself or in the network.  The trade-off
   decision can be driven even by end user measurements.

   Measurement application useful for the app developer can be quality
   of experience of a specific network or quality of experience on a set
   of networks available to the user.  Measurements can be used to
   encourage the network operator to adopt more efficient radio
   technologies to support services that could be limited by network
   efficiency so far.

14.  Stakeholder: Governmental policy maker

   The Governmental policy maker stakeholder includes several use cases:

14.1.  Use Case: POLICY CHECK

   In order to check the behavior of network players against current
   policies, the behavior of networks must be measured from an end-user
   perspective.  So, as an example, if current policies require that
   emergency calls be supported by all network operators even when the
   UE is SIM-less or belonging to a different operator, then
   measurements are required to check the compliance against this
   requirement.

   Measurement application that can be useful for this use case are
   overall data on quality of experience measured by UEs across
   different networks.  It is important to characterize the measurements
   with dimensions that support the policy check under test.  As in the




Bovo & Marks             Expires January 7, 2016               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft            Mobile LMAP Use Cases                July 2015


   previous example, it is necessary to associate the measurements to
   the home network users, roamers, and SIM-less UEs.

14.2.  Use Case: COMPETITION CHECK

   Governmental policy makers could encourage competition between NOs.
   In case of resources shared by different actors (e.g. shared sites,
   shared network entities, radio spectrum, etc.) it could be relevant
   to measure current behavior for different NOs.  An example could be
   the support of legacy services that the governmental policy maker
   requires be maintained (e.g. technically obsolete radio technologies
   to be maintained for a certain period of time with specific level of
   service).

   In this use case the overall data on quality of experience could be
   measured by UEs across different networks.

14.3.  Use Case: STRATEGIC DIRECTION and EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT

   Governmental policy makers could encourage the adoption of
   technologies with a strategic plan, for example to achieve a better
   environmental sustainability.  Measurements with this perspective can
   be related for example to battery usage per services, spectrum needs,
   or specific geographical areas.  For example, it could be specified
   that some specific geographical region will support at least a
   certain number of concurrent calls per location area.  So, admission
   control and network allocated resources have to deal with these
   requirements.

   Another example relates to technological evolution, such as measuring
   the amount of traffic for specific services encouraging the
   deployment of new technologies to support better usage of scarce
   spectrum, for example with a better spectral efficiency or operation
   with reduced radio signal power.  In general, users may be hesitant
   to convert to new UE technology due to cost without unbiased
   reassurance of the technical benefits to the individual users of
   making the transition; unbiased measurements may thereby encourage
   individual equipment upgrades that would contribute toward a more
   efficient network operation.

   Measurement application for these use cases include the overall data
   on quality of experience measured by UEs and also service
   measurements geo-located or correlated to radio conditions, even
   associated to other UE parameters (e.g. type of device, radio access
   technology, battery consumption,radio signal strength).
