1.  Introduction

   When developing an internet video codec, changes and additions to the
   codec need to be decided based on their performance tradeoffs.  In
   addition, measurements are needed to determine when the codec has met
   its performance goals.  This document specifies how the tests are to
   be carried about to ensure valid comparisons and good decisions.

2.  Subjective Metrics

   Subjective testing is the preferable method of testing video codecs.

   Because the IETF does not have testing resources of its own, it has
   to rely on the resources of its participants.  For this reason, even
   if the group agrees that a particular test is important, if no one
   volunteers to do it, or if volunteers do not complete it in a timely
   fashion, then that test should be discarded.  This ensures that only
   important tests be done in particular, the tests that are important
   to participants.

3.  Objective Metrics

   Objective metrics are used in place of subjective metrics for easy
   and repeatable experiments.  Most objective metrics have been
   designed to correlate with subjective scores.

   The following descriptions give an overview of the operation of each
   of the metrics.  Because implementation details can sometimes vary,
   the exact implementation is specified in C in the Daala tools
   repository [DAALA-GIT].

   All of the metrics described in this document are to be applied to
   the luma plane only.  In addition, they are single frame metrics.
   When applied to the video, the scores of each frame are averaged to
   create the final score.

   Codecs are allowed to internally use downsampling, but must include a
   normative upsampler, so that the metrics run at the same resolution
   as the source video.  In addition, some metrics, such as PSNR and
   FASTSSIM, have poor behavior on downsampled images, so it must be
   noted in test results if downsampling is in effect.

3.1.  PSNR

   PSNR is a traditional signal quality metric, measured in decibels.
   It is directly drived from mean square error (MSE), or its square
   root (RMSE).  The formula used is:

   20 * log10 ( MAX / RMSE )

   or, equivalently:

   10 * log10 ( MAX^2 / MSE )

   which is the method used in the dump_psnr.c reference implementation.

3.2.  PSNR-HVS-M

   The PSNR-HVS metric performs a DCT transform of 8x8 blocks of the
   image, weights the coefficients, and then calculates the PSNR of
   those coefficients.  Several different sets of weights have been
   considered.  [PSNRHVS] The weights used by the dump_pnsrhvs.c tool in
   the Daala repository have been found to be the best match to real MOS
   scores.

3.3.  SSIM

   SSIM (Structural Similarity Image Metric) is a still image quality
   metric introduced in 2004 [SSIM].  It computes a score for each
   individual pixel, using a window of neighboring pixels.  These scores
   can then be averaged to produce a global score for the entire image.
   The original paper produces scores ranging between 0 and 1.

   For the metric to appear more linear on BD-rate curves, the score is
   converted into a nonlinear decibel scale:

   -10 * log10 (1 - SSIM)

3.4.  Fast Multi-Scale SSIM

   Multi-Scale SSIM is SSIM extended to multiple window sizes [MSSSIM].
   This is implemented in the Fast implementation by downscaling the
   image a number of times, and computing SSIM over the same number of
   pixels, then averaging the SSIM scores together [FASTSSIM].  The
   final score is converted to decibels in the same manner as SSIM.

4.  Comparing and Interpreting Results

4.1.  Graphing

   When displayed on a graph, bitrate is shown on the X axis, and the
   quality metric is on the Y axis.  For clarity, the X axis bitrate is
   always graphed in the log domain.  The Y axis metric should also be
   chosen so that the graph is approximately linear.  For metrics such
   as PSNR and PSNR-HVS, the metric result is already in the log domain
   and is left as-is.  SSIM and FASTSSIM, on the other hand, return a
   result between 0 and 1.  To create more linear graphs, this result is
   converted to a value in decibels:

   -1 * log10 ( 1 - SSIM )

4.2.  Bjontegaard

   The Bjontegaard rate difference, also known as BD-rate, allows the
   comparison of two different codecs based on a metric.  This is
   commonly done by fitting a curve to each set of data points on the
   plot of bitrate versus metric score, and then computing the
   difference in area between each of the curves.  A cubic polynomial
   fit is common, but will be overconstrained with more than four
   samples.  For higher accuracy, at least 10 samples and a linear
   piecewise fit should be used.  In addition, if using a truncated BD-
   rate curve, there should be at least 4 samples within the point of
   interest.

4.3.  Ranges

   The curve is split into three regions, for low, medium, and high
   bitrate.  The ranges are defined as follows:

   o  Low bitrate: 0.005 - 0.02 bpp

Internet-Draft Video Codec Testing and Quality Measurement     July 2015


   o  Medium bitrate: 0.02 - 0.1 bpp

   o  High bitrate: 0.1 - 0.2 bpp

   Bitrate can be calculated from bits per pixel (bpp) as follows:

   bitrate = bpp * width * height * framerate

5.  Test Sequences

5.1.  Sources

   Lossless test clips are preferred for most tests, because the
   structure of compression artifacts in already-compressed clips may
   introduce extra noise in the test results.  However, a large amount
   of content on the internet needs to be recompressed at least once, so
   some sources of this nature are useful.  The encoder should run at
   the same bit depth as the original source.  In addition, metrics need
   to support operation at high bit depth.  If one or more codecs in a
   comparison do not support high bit depth, sources need to be
   converted once before entering the encoder.

   The JCT-VC standards organization includes a set of standard test
   clips for video codec testing, and parameters to run the clips with
   [L1100].  These clips are not publicly available, but are very useful
   for comparing to published results.

   Xiph publishes a variety of test clips collected from various
   sources.

   The Blender Open Movie projects provide a large test base of lossless
   cinematic test material.  The lossless sources are available, hosted
   on Xiph.

5.2.  Test Sets

   Sources are divided into several categories to test different
   scenarios the codec will be required to operate in.  For easier
   comaprison, all videos in each set should have the same color
   subsampling, same resolution, and same number of frames.  In
   addition, all test videos must be publicly available for testing use,
   to allow any results

   o  Still images are useful when comparing intra coding performance.
      Xiph.org has four sets of lossless, one megapixel images that have
      been converted into YUV 4:2:0 format.  There are four sets that
      can be used:

      *  subset1 (50 images)

      *  subset2 (50 images)

      *  subset3 (1000 images)

      *  subset4 (1000 images)

   o  video-hd-2, a set that consists of the following 1920x1080 clips
      from [DERFVIDEO], cropped to 50 frames (and converted to 4:2:0 if
      necessary)

      *  aspen

      *  blue_sky

      *  crowd_run

      *  ducks_take_off

      *  factory

      *  life

      *  park_joy

      *  pedestrian_area

      *  red_kayak

      *  riverbed

      *  rush_hour

      *  station2

   o  A video conferencing test set, with 1280x720 content at 60 frames
      per second.  Unlike other sets, the videos in this set are 10
      seconds long.

      *  TBD

   o  Game streaming content: 1920x1080, 60 frames per second, 4:2:0
      chroma subsampling. 1080p is chosen as it is currently the most
      common gaming monitor resolution [STEAM].  All clips should be two
      seconds long.

      *  TBD

   o  Screensharing content is low framerate, high resolution content
      typical of a computer desktop.

      *  screenshots - desktop screenshots of various resolutions, with
         4:2:0 subsampling

      *  Video sets TBD

5.3.  Operating Points

   All test sets except for video conferencing should be run at the best
   quality mode available, using the mode that will provide the best
   quality per bitrate (VBR or constant quality mode).  Lookahead and/or
   two-pass are allowed, if supported.  Example configurations follow:

   o  x264: -crf=x

   o  x265: -crf=x

   o  daala: -v=x

   o  libvpx: -codec=vp9 -end-usage=q -cq-level=x

   The video conferencing test set should be run in CBR mode, with a
   buffer size not greater than 300ms * bitrate.

6.  Automation

   Frequent objective comparisons are extremely beneficial while
   developing a new codec.  Several tools exist in order to automate the
   process of objective comparisons.  The Compare-Codecs tool allows BD-
   rate curves to be generated for a wide variety of codecs
   [COMPARECODECS].  The Daala source repository contains a set of
   scripts that can be used to automate the various metrics used.  In
   addition, these scripts can be run automatically utilizing
   distributed computer for fast results [AWCY].
