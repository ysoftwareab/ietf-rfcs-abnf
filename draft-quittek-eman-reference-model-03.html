<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> Introduction</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">Managing energy consumption of devices is different from several well understood network management functions because of the special nature of energy supply and use.  This memo explains issues of energy management arising from its special nature and proposes a reference model for energy management addressing these issues.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">Defining a suitable reference model for energy management has proven to be explorative work that cannot be done in a single step because the area is rather new to people at the IETF.  Ideas for a reference model have been elaborated in <a href="#I-D.ietf-eman-framework">[I-D.ietf-eman-framework]</a> and previous versions of this draft.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">This revision is an attempt to combine the relationship model proposed in the last version (-02) of <a href="#I-D.ietf-eman-framework">[I-D.ietf-eman-framework]</a> with the concept of power interfaces proposed in the previous version (-02) of this draft.  The result is a four layer model of energy management. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">This draft starts with identifying and describing in <a href="#issues">Section 2</a> the special issues of energy management that require the development of a new reference model.  The issues concern power supply, power and energy metering, and the reporting of low-power states.</p>
<p><a href="#reference-model">Section 3</a> addresses these issues and proposed a new four layer model for energy management, see <a href="#fig-layers-intro">Figure 1</a>.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.2.p.3">The device may have local energy control mechanisms, for example putting itself into a sleep mode when appropriate, and it may receive energy control commands for similar purposes from a management system.  Information reported from a powered device to the energy management system includes at least the power state of the device (on, sleep, off, etc.).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.4">This and similar cases are well understood and likely to become very common for energy management. They can be handled with well established and standardized management procedures.  The only missing components today are standardized information and data models for reporting and configuration, such as, for example, energy-specific MIB modules <a href="#RFC2578">[RFC2578]</a> and YANG modules <a href="#RFC6020">[RFC6020]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.5">However, the nature of energy supply and use introduces some issues that are special to energy management. The following subsections address these issues and illustrate them by extending the basic scenario in <a href="#fig-basicexample">Figure 2</a>.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.1">A powered device may supply itself with power.  Sensors, for example, commonly have batteries or harvest energy.  However, most powered devices that are managed by an energy management system receive external power.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.2">While a huge number of devices receive power from unmanaged supply systems, the number of manageable power supply devices is increasing.  In datacenters, many Power Distribution Units (PDUs) allow the network management system to switch power individually for each socket and also to measure the provided power.  Here there is a big difference to many other network management tasks:  In such and similar cases, switching power supply for a powered device or monitoring its power is not done by communicating with the actual powered device, but with an external power supply device (which may be an external power meter).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.3">Consequently, a standard for energy management must not just cover the powered devices that provide services for users, but also the power supply devices (which are powered devices as well) that monitor or control the power supply for other powered devices.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.4">A very simple device such as a plain light bulb can be switched on or off only by switching its power supply.  More complex devices may have the ability to switch off themselves or to bring  themselves to states in which they consume very little power.  For these devices as well it is desirable to monitor and control their power supply.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.2.1.1.p.1">When a power supply device controls or monitors power supply at one of its power outlets, the effect on other devices is not always clear without knowledge about wiring of power lines.  The same holds for monitoring.  The power supplying device can report that a particular socket is powered, and it may even be able to measure power and conclude that there is a consumer drawing power at that socket, but it may not know which powered device receives the provided power.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.1.p.2">In many cases it is obvious which other device is supplied by a certain outlet, but this always requires additional (reliable) information about power line wiring.  Without knowing which device(s) are powered via a certain outlet, monitoring data are of limited value and switching on the consequences of switching power on or off may be hard to predict.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.1.p.3">Even in well organized operations, powered devices' power lines get plugged into the wrong socket, or wiring plans are changed without updating the energy management system accordingly.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.1.p.4">For reliable monitoring and control of power supply devices, additional information is needed to identify the device(s) that receive power provided at a particular monitored and controlled socket.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.1.p.5">This problem also occurs in the opposite direction. If power supply control or monitoring for a certain device is needed, then the supplying power supply device has to be identified.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.5.p.1">There are three ways for an energy management system to change the power state of a managed entity. First is for a management system to provide policy or other useful information (like the electricity price) to the powered device for it to use in determining its power state. The second is sending the entity a command to switch to another state. The third is to utilize an upstream device (to the powered device) that has capabilities to switch on and off power at its outlet.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.5.p.2">Some entities do not have capabilities for receiving commands or changing their power states by themselves. Such devices may be controlled by switching on and off the power supply for them and so have particular need for the third method.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.5.p.3">In <a href="#fig-powersupply">Figure 3</a> the power supply can switch on and off power at its power outlet and thereby switch on and off power supply for the connected powered device.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.2.2">2.2.</a> Power and Energy Measurement</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.1">Some devices include hardware to directly measure their power and energy consumption.  However, most common networked devices do not provide an interface that gives access to energy and power measurements for the device.  Hardware instrumentation for this kind of measurements is typically not in place and adding it incurs an additional cost.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.2">With the increasing cost of energy and the growing importance of energy monitoring, it is expected that in future more devices will include instrumentation for power and energy measurements, but this may take quite some time.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.2.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.2.2.1">2.2.1.</a> Local Estimates</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.1.p.1">One solution to this problem is for the device to estimate its own power and consumed energy. For many energy management tasks, getting an estimate is much better than not getting any information at all.  Estimates can be based on actual measured activity level of a device or it can just depend on the power state (on, sleep, off, etc.).  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.1.p.2">The advantage of estimates is that they can be realized locally and with much lower cost than hardware instrumentation. Local estimates can be dealt with in traditional ways. They don't need an extension of the basic example above. However, the powered device needs an energy model of itself to make estimates.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.2.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.2.2.2">2.2.2.</a> Management System Estimates</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.2.p.1">Another approach to the lack of instrumentation is estimation by the energy management system. The management system can estimate power based on basic information on the powered device, such as the type of device, or also its brand/model and functional characteristics.  Energy estimates can combine the typical power level by power state with reported data about the power state.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.2.p.2">If the energy management system has a detailed energy model of the device, it can produce better estimates including the actual power state and actual activity level of the device.  Such information can be obtained by monitoring the device with conventional means of performance monitoring.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.2.3">2.3.</a> Reporting Sleep and Off States</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.1">Low power modes pose special challenges for energy reporting because they may preclude a device from listening to and responding to network requests.  Devices may still be able to reliably track energy use in these modes, as power levels are usually static and internal clocks can track elapsed time in these modes. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.2">Some devices do have out-of-band or proxy abilities to respond to network requests in low-power modes.  Others could use proxy abilities in an energy management protocol to improve this reporting, particularly if the device sends out notifications of power state changes.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.2.4">2.4.</a> Entities</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.4.p.1">The primary focus of energy management is entire devices, but in some applications it is necessary or desirable to also have visibility into energy use of internal components such as line cards, fans, disks, etc.  Components lack some of the features of devices, such as having power interfaces; instead, they simply have a net total consumption from the pool of power available within a device.  Note that a device need not have an AC power cord.

<li>inlet: receiving power</li>
<li>outlet: providing power</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<br><br> Most power interfaces never change their mode, but as the mode is simply a recognition of the current direction of electricity flow, there is no barrier to a mode change.  <br><br> A power interface can have capabilities for metering power and other electric quantities at the shared power transmission medium.

This extends the term powered device (PD) used in <a href="#IEEE-802.3af">[IEEE-802.3af]</a> and <a href="#IEEE-802.3at">[IEEE-802.3at]</a> to cover not only entities that are individual devices, but also entities that are just components of devices.</li></ul>
<p></p>

<ul><li>Power Source (PS)<br> An entity with one or more PIs in mode "outlet" is called a power source (PS). This extends the term Power Source Equipment (PSE) used in the IEEE PoE standards <a href="#IEEE-802.3af">[IEEE-802.3af]</a> and <a href="#IEEE-802.3at">[IEEE-802.3at]</a> where at a single PI the PSE provides power to a single PD only. Here a PS may supply an arbitrary number of PEs at a single PI. Most PSs have also PIs in mode "inlet" and all are also a PE.</li></ul>
<p></p>

<ul><li>Power Meter (PM)<br> A metering function attached to a power interface of an entity is called a power meter (PM).  Power meters are contained within an entity and attached to one or more of the entity's power interfaces.  A single PM can only provide a single meter reading at a time.  Most PIs will be connected to a single other PI only, but those attached to multiple power interfaces only measure the aggregate use over all of the other interfaces.  Components that lack interfaces have a meter for their total net consumption.</li></ul>

<p id="rfc.section.3.1.6.1.p.1">A power source relationship exists between an outlet PI of a PS and an inlet PI of a PE.  It is an asymmetric relationship. The role of the outlet is providing energy and the role of the inlet is receiving energy.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.6.1.p.2">An outlet can be directly connected to multiple inlets and thus can have multiple power source relationships.  An inlet is typically connected to a single outlets only and thus has only one power source relationship to a directly connected outlet.

<p id="rfc.section.3.1.6.1.p.3">The relationship is transitive.  If an outlet PI acts as power source for an inlet PI of an entity that itself acts as PS for further PEs, then the outlet may have also power source relationships to inlets of entities supplied by the entity in the middle.</p>

<ul><li>PI monitoring<br> This interfaces provide methods for retrieving information on PIs contained in the EO.  Particularly included is information on the mode of the PI (inlet or outlet) and its operational state (on, off, ready, etc.) and known power source relationships and power meter relationships.</li></ul>
<p></p>

<ul><li>PI control<br> PI control is limited to switching PIs on and off.</li></ul>
<p></p>

<ul><li>Meter reading<br> This interfaces includes methods for reporting quantities that are measured by power meters and that are related to power and to energy consumption.</li></ul>
<p></p>

<ul><li>Power state monitoring<br> Methods of this interface provide information on power states of PEs. These methods are only available at PEs. But since all EOs can be considered to be PEs they can in general be made available at any EO.</li></ul>
<p></p>

<ul><li>Power state control<br> The number of control methods at this interface may be very small.  At least included is a method for setting the power state of a PE.</li></ul>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.1">Information and control means provided by the LMI layer is local to the reporting EO. However, with information from the PSU layer, there are some obvious steps of processing this information to make it more useful or easier to digest by an energy management system.  In general, all functions in this layer are 'convenience' functions and an energy management system can execute all of them directly.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.2">This layer may contain various kinds of functions. The ones that are already known can be structured into 7 groups:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>remote PE information</li>
<li>remote PE control</li>
<li>all available information on a PE</li>
<li>all available control affecting a PE</li>
<li>aggregated information from multiple PEs</li>
<li>aggregated control of multiple PEs</li>
<li>proxying for an EO</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.4">This list may not be complete, so that new 'convenience' functions may be added. Some of them may not match any of the groups listed above. <a href="#fig-emm">Figure 21</a> shows (except for the proxying functions) how the groups are structured in the EMM layer and interact with the LMI layer.</p>

        </pre>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.5">In this layer, EOs offer functions to the EnMS that concern other PEs.  By doing so, they establish a relationship to the respective PEs.  Relationships on this layer include</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Reporting relationship<br> This relationship is between a reporting EO and a PE on which it reports.  It is an asymmetric relationship and the PE on which is reported may not even have any knowledge on the existence of the relationship. Subject of reporting can be the power supply status for PE, metered values for a PE, a power state information on a PE, and other information on the PE that is relevant for the energy management system.  </li>
<li>Control relationship<br> Analogous to the reporting relationship, the control relationship is between a controlling EO and a controlled PE. Again, the PE does not necessary know of this relationship, for example, in case the controlling EO controls the power supply of a PE by communicating with the PS supplying the PE.  This can be done in a way that is completely hidden from the PE.  Subject of control can be the power supply of the PE, its power state, and other states relevant for the energy management system.</li>
<li>Proxy relationship<br> This is a relationship between a proxying EO and a proxied PE.  The concept of a proxy relationship overlaps with the reporting relationship and the control relationship. A proxy relationship always includes one of the two or both. Characteristic for a proxy relationship is that it includes reporting or control function that the proxying EO cannot conduct without remotely retrieving data or remotely controlling other EOs.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.7">The groups of the EMM layer are described individually in the following subsections.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.3.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.3.1">3.3.1.</a> Remote PE Information</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.1.p.1">This group contains functions that allow an EO to provide information about another PE.  These functions are useful in scenarios like the ones described in Section <a href="#powersupply">2.1</a> where an EO switches or measures power at an outlet PI.  If the EO has information on the PSU layer topology, particularly about which PEs are connected to the outlet, then it can combine this information and report on the power supply for the connected PEs.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.1.p.2">This way an EO uses local information and deduces information on other, remote PEs from it.  Such information may not be as reliable as a direct report from the concerned PEs, but it is often valuable information for energy management.  Such reporting must be cognizant of possibilities like devices with multiple power supplies.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.1.p.3">The functions in this group can also be implemented by EOs that are neither one of the concerned PEs nor the EO at which the observation or measurement was conducted.  In such a case the executing EOs of these functions act as a kind of mid-level manager between management system and managed devices and could, for example, be components of an conventional element management system.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.1.p.4">Obviously, the EO that reports on a certain other PE has a reporting relationship to the PE. However, if the PE is aware of the relationship, the PE may have means to report which EO has which kind of relationship to it.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.1.p.5">Like some other functions on the EMM layer, the remote PE functions are 'convenience' functions.  Inferring available information from different EOs can also be done by the energy management system.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.3.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.3.2">3.3.2.</a> Remote PE Control</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.2.p.1">This group has some similarities to the previous one.  Again, operations at an EO are combined with knowledge of the PSU layer topology in order to realize operations on a remote PE.  In the example scenario from figures <a href="#fig-psu-simple"></a> and <a href="#fig-psu-simple-model"></a>, power for the PE can be switching by switching the outlet PI ID 1 of the PS.  On the LMI layer the offered function would be "switch of PI ID 1 at PS".  This function can be offered by the PS at the EMM layer as "switch power for the  PE".  Both function would have the same technical effect, but they are semantically on different layers.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.2.p.2">Here, the EO that controls an PE has a control relationship to the PE. If the PE is aware of the relationship, the PE may have means to report which EO has which kind of relationship to it.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.2.p.3">Again, like in the previous group, these functions are convenience functions and they can be executed by the PS, by the PE or by any other EO.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.3.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.3.3">3.3.3.</a> Parent function: All Available Information on a PE</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.3.p.1">This group provides just a single logical function that we call the parent function for reporting:  A parent EO makes all information on a PE, that is available somewhere in the network, but that might be distributed among several EOs, available at a single point of contact, the parent.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.3.p.2">Realizing such a function would be expected to require to instantiate several of the functions in the "Remote PE Information" group described above.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.3.p.3">The parent EO that provides all available information on a certain other PE has definitely a reporting relationship to it.  In addition it may have a proxying relationship, for example if it reports the PE's power state.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.3.p.4">This function is again a 'convenience' function for an energy management system that in some cases may be much easier done locally at involved EOs than within the energy management system.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.3.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.3.4">3.3.4.</a> All Available Control Affecting a PE</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.4.p.1">This group also provides just a single logical function: The parent control function: It makes all control functions affecting a PE, that are available somewhere in the network, but that might be distributed among several EOs, available at a single point of contact, the parent.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.4.p.2">Realizing such a function would be expected to require to instantiate several of the functions in the "Remote PE Control" group described above.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.4.p.3">Again, the parent EO that controls a certain other PE has a control relationship to it. If controls the power state, it may also be a  proxy relationship.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.4.p.4">This function is again a 'convenience' function for an energy management system that in some cases may be much easier done locally at involved EOs than within the energy management system.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.3.5">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.3.5">3.3.5.</a> Aggregated Information from Multiple PEs</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.5.p.1">Functions in this group aggregate monitoring information from multiple PEs into more compact representations with potential loss of information.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.5.p.2">For example, power measurements from a set of PEs may be summed up into a single value that is provided to an energy management system that does not need more detailed information.  aggregating such information in the EMM layer is not just a convenience functions but may also increase scalability of the energy management system.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.5.p.3">Aggregation is not necessarily limited to just summing up values. Also included, for example, are aggregation functions that give information on how many PEs of a group are in a certain power state. The range of potential functions in this group appears to be huge. However, it will probably sufficient to standardize the most commonly used ones only.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.3.6">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.3.6">3.3.6.</a> Aggregated Control of Multiple PEs</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.6.p.1">Like monitoring and reporting functions covered in the previous group, also control functions can be aggregated.  Examples include switching power supply for all PEs in a given group or setting all of them to the same power state with a single command.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.6.p.2">Again, this can be considered a convenience function, but at the same time increase scalability of the energy management system. And again it will probably be sufficient to standardize just a few of the wide range of possible functions in this group.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.3.7">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.3.7">3.3.7.</a> Proxying for an EO</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.7.p.1">This section still needs to be written. Summary: An EO can act as a proxy for an EO that cannot directly communicate with the energy management system.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.4">3.4.</a> <a href="#EnMS-layer" id="EnMS-layer">Energy Management System Interface (EnMS) Layer</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.p.1">The EMS receives EMAN data directly from devices, or via the mediation layer.  Similarly, it can exercise control directly or via the mediation layer.  In many cases, the same action can be accomplished through either means, though some are only available via mediation.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.4">4.</a> Security Considerations</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">This memo currently does not impose any security considerations.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5">
<a href="#rfc.section.5">5.</a> IANA Considerations</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.1">This memo has no actions for IANA.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.6">
<a href="#rfc.section.6">6.</a> Acknowledgements</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.1">This memo was inspired by discussions with Benoit Claise, John Parello, Mouli Chandramouli, Rolf Winter, Thomas Dietz, Bill Mielke, and Chris Verges.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7">
<a href="#rfc.section.7">7.</a> Open Issues</h1>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.1">7.1.</a> Devices or entities?</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.1">Entities expands on the category of devices by adding components.  Do components have all the features of devices (including having power interfaces) or do they only have metering of their energy/power use?  The relationships among powered devices, powered entities, components, and electrical objects needs to be clarified.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.2">7.2.</a> Add PM monitoring and control interfaces to LMI layer?</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.1">In earlier versions of this draft, monitoring and configuring the power meter have also been considered.  Shall we list them as further local interfaces on the LMI layer?</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.3">7.3.</a> Topology changes</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.p.1">Ideally topology would never change so the EMS need only query it once.  A date/time stamp for time of last topology change would enable the EMS to know when it needs to rescan the topology.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.4">7.4.</a> Topology reporting</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.4.p.1">For each interface, there is a list of [device,interface] tuples that is connected to the interface.  If one of these is listed as "unknown", then any number of unknown devices may be connected (that is, the device need not specify the number, since likely it will usually not know).  Topology information need not be symmetric.  A device providing power to the second may know the ID of the second while the second device may lack knowledge of the ID of the supplying device.  The mediation layer brings together such information to form a more complete picture.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.5">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.5">7.5.</a> Proxying</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.5.p.1">Does all proxying occur at the mediation layer?</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.6">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.6">7.6.</a> PSU Info Model</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.6.p.1">The PSU layer information model needs to be further elaborated.</p>
