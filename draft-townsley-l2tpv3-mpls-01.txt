Abstract

   The Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol, Version 3, (L2TPv3) defines a
   protocol for tunneling a variety of payload types over IP networks.
   This document defines how to carry an MPLS label or label stack and
   its payload over L2TPv3. This enables an application which
   traditionally requires an MPLS-enabled core network to utilize an
   L2TPv3 encapsulation over an IP network instead.

Specification of Requirements

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


1. Introduction

   This document defines how to encapsulate an MPLS label or label stack
   and its payload over L2TPv3. After defining the MPLS over L2TPv3
   encapsulation procedure, other MPLS over IP encapsulation options
   including IP, GRE and IPsec are discussed in context with MPLS over
   L2TPv3 in an Applicability section. This document only describes
   encapsulation and does not concern itself with all possible MPLS-
   based applications which may be enabled over L2TPv3.

2. MPLS over L2TPv3 Encoding

   MPLS over L2TPv3 allows tunneling of an MPLS stack [RFC3032] over an
   IP network utilizing the L2TPv3 encapsulation defined in [L2TPv3].

   Session ID

      The L2TPv3 Session ID is a 32-bit identifier field locally
      selected as a lookup key for the context of an L2TP Session.  An
      L2TP Session contains necessary context for processing a received
      L2TP packet. At a minimum, such context contains whether the
      Cookie (see description below) is present and the value it was
      assigned, as well as what type of tunneled encapsulation follows
      (i.e., Frame Relay, Ethernet, MPLS, etc).

   Cookie

      The L2TPv3 Cookie field contains a variable length (maximum 64
      bits) randomly assigned value.  It is intended to provide an
      additional level of guarantee that a data packet has been directed
      to the proper L2TP session by the Session ID.  While the Session
      ID may be encoded and assigned any value (perhaps optimizing for
      local lookup capabilities, redirection in a distributed forwarding
      architecture, etc.), the Cookie MUST be selected as a random
      value, with the added restriction that it not be the same as a
      recently used value for a given Session ID.  A well-chosen Cookie

      will prevent inadvertent misdirection of a stray packet containing
      a recently reused Session ID, a Session ID that is subject to
      packet corruption, and protection against some specific malicious
      packet insertion attacks, as described in more detail in Section
      4.2 of this document.

   Label Stack Entry

      An MPLS label as defined in [RFC3032].

   The optional L2-Specific-Sublayer defined in [L2TPv3] is generally
   not present for MPLS over L2TPv3.

   Generic IP encapsulation procedures such as MTU considerations,
   handling of TTL, EXP and DSCP bits, etc. are the same as the "Common
   Procedures" for IP encapsulation of MPLS defined in Section 5 of
   [MPLS-IP-GRE] and are not reiterated here.

3. Assigning the L2TPv3 Session ID and Cookie

   Much like an MPLS label, the L2TPv3 Session ID and Cookie must be
   selected and exchanged between participating nodes before L2TPv3 can
   operate. These values may be configured manually, or distributed via
   a signaling protocol. This document concerns itself only with the
   encapsulation of MPLS over L2TPv3, so the particular method of
   assigning the Session ID and Cookie for a given application is out of
   scope here.

4. Applicability

   The methods defined [MPLS-IP-GRE], [MPLS-IPSEC] and this document all
   describe methods for carrying MPLS over an IP network. Cases where
   MPLS over L2TPv3 may be applicable compared to other alternatives are
   discussed here.

   The use of IP or GRE to carry MPLS labels increases the opportunity
   for MPLS label spoofing attacks. It is generally a more simple matter
   to have one's border routers refuse to accept an MPLS packet than to
   configure a router to refuse to accept certain MPLS packets carried
   in IP or GRE to or from certain IP sources or destinations.  If the
   IP network which MPLS packets are being carried over is vulnerable to
   spoofing attacks which could bypass these boundary ACLs, but is
   secure from a hacker who can actively sniff IP traffic between nodes
   and correlate data obtained for a coordinated attack, then the L2TPv3
   Cookie provides ample protection in a very lightweight manner as
   compared with [MPLS-IPSEC].





Townsley                    Standards Track                     [Page 4]





INTERNET DRAFT              MPLS over L2TPv3               December 2003


   MPLS over L2TPv3 may be favorable compared to [MPLS-IP-GRE], if:

      Two routers are "adjacent" over an L2TPv3 tunnel that exists for
      some reason outside the scope of this document, and those two
      routers need to send MPLS packets over that adjacency.

      Implementation considerations dictate the use of MPLS over L2TPv3.
      For example, some hardware device might only be able to handle
      L2TPv3 encapsulations in its fastpath.

   (The above two applicability statements were adopted from [MPLS-IP-
   GRE])

   In summary, L2TPv3 can provide a balance between the limited security
   against IP spoofing attacks offered by [MPLS-IP-GRE] vs. the greater
   security and associated operational and processing overhead offered
   by [MPLS-IPSEC].  Further, MPLS over L2TPv3 may be faster in some
   hardware, particularly if it is already optimized to classify
   incoming L2TPv3 packets carrying IP framed in a variety of ways. That
   is, IP encapsulated by HDLC or Frame Relay over L2TPv3 may be
   considered not that far removed from IP encapsulated by MPLS over
   L2TPv3.

5. Security Considerations

   The L2TPv3 Cookie does not provide cryptographic security of any
   kind.  However, when used with a sufficiently random 64-bit value
   which is kept secret from a hacker, the L2TPv3 Cookie may be used as
   a simple yet effective packet source authentication check which is
   quite resistent to brute force packet spoofing attacks. It also
   alleviates the need to verify or filter packets based on a list of
   valid source IP addresses, and thwarts attacks which could benefit by
   spoofing a permitted source IP address.

   L2TPv3 tunnels may also be secured using IPsec.  When using IPsec,
   the tunnel head and the tunnel tail should be treated as the
   endpoints of a Security Association.  The MPLS over L2TPv3
   encapsulated packets should be considered as originating at the
   tunnel head and as being destined for the tunnel tail; IPsec
   transport mode should thus be used. Key distribution may be done
   either manually or automatically.

   Security is also discussed as part of the applicability discussion in
   section 4 of this document.
