Internet-Draft               vCard-Extension                   July 2010


1.  Introduction

   As social networking has become common, it has become clear that
   users would like to include information in their vCards
   [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-vcardrev] about their social networks.  Well
   organized social network information allows the vCard owner to share
   his profile information and to import or subscribe to profile
   information of others on joining a new network.

1.1.  Terminology Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Syntax specifications shown here use the augmented Backus-Naur Form
   (ABNF) as described in [RFC5234], and are specified as in the base
   vcard specification [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-vcardrev].


2.  Social Network Properties

   These properties are related to sharing social-network information.
   The basis for these properties came from the "Friend of a Friend"
   (FOAF) specification, http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/ , and we should
   consider other aspects of that specification.  Do we want to align
   directly with FOAF items?

2.1.  Property: OpenID

   [[anchor1: *** Maybe this should be something like
   "authentication;type=openid:" instead? *** Barry]]

   Purpose:  OpenID is an open, decentralized user identification
       standard, allowing users to log onto many services with the same
       digital identity.  Inclusion of an OpenID URI in a vCard lets
       others add the vCard owner's ID to their authorization lists.


   Value type:  A single URI value.


   Cardinality:  (0,n)

Internet-Draft               vCard-Extension                   July 2010


   ABNF:

       OPENID-param =  "VALUE=uri" / pid-param / pref-param /
               any-param

       OPENID-value =  uri


   Example:

     OpenID:http://www.alice.openid.example.org


2.2.  Property: socialProfile

   Purpose:  Designates the vCard owner's profile page on a particular
       social network.


   Value type:  A single URI value.


   Cardinality:  (0,n)


   Special note:  This property SHOULD include the parameter "TYPE" to
       specify the name of the social network that it refers to.
       Usually, that will also be discernible from the URI, which is why
       it's optional.  But it can be helpful to have it specified
       explicitly.


   ABNF:

       SOCIALPROFILE-param =  "VALUE=uri" / pid-param / pref-param /
               any-param

       SOCIALPROFILE-value =  uri


   Examples:

     socialProfile;type=linkedin:http://www.linkedin.com/in/barryleiba

     socialProfile;type=facebook:http://www.facebook.com/barackobama

2.3.  Property: album

   Purpose:  Designates an online album, such as a photo album or video
       album.


   Value type:  A single URI value.


   Cardinality:  (0,n)


   Special note:  This property SHOULD include the parameter "TYPE" to
       specify the type of album that it refers to.  Usually, that will
       also be discernible from the URI, which is why it's optional.
       But it can be helpful to have it specified explicitly.


   ABNF:

       ALBUM-param =  "VALUE=uri" / pid-param / pref-param /
               any-param

       ALBUM-value =  uri


   Example:

     album;type=photo:http://www.flickr.com/photos/barryleiba
     album;type=video:http://www.youtube.com/user/barryleiba


2.4.  Property: depiction

   [[anchor2: *** What's the difference between this and "photo", from
   the base spec? *** (Barry)]]

   Purpose:  A depiction of something.


   Value type:  A single value.  The default is binary value.  It can
       also be reset to uri value.


   Cardinality:  (0,n)

Internet-Draft               vCard-Extension                   July 2010


   Special notes:  A common use of depiction (and depicts) is to
       indicate the contents of a digital image, for example the people
       or objects represented in an online photo gallery.

       The basic notion of 'depiction' could also be extended to deal
       with multimedia content (video clips, audio),


   Example:

     depiction;value=uri:http://www.example.com/pub/photos/jqpublic.gif


2.5.  Property: socialCode

   Purpose:  Description of the vCard owner, in the form of a "social
       code", such as the "geek code" (see
       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek_code).  Social codes are
       popularly used to exchange a large amount of social information
       in a compact way, and provide a somewhat frivolous and willfully
       obscure "fun" mechanism for characterizing technical expertise,
       interests, and habits.


   Value type:  A single text value.


   Cardinality:  (0,n)


   Special notes:  This property MUST include the parameter "TYPE" to
       specify the type of social network code being used.  There are no
       predefined values for "TYPE", here -- the types will be
       understood (or not) by the vCard users.

       If the code contains characters that have to be quoted, such as
       COLON, SEMICOLON, or COMMA, remember to enclose the value in
       quotes.


   ABNF:

       SOCIALCODE-param =  "VALUE=text" / pid-param / pref-param /
               any-param

Internet-Draft               vCard-Extension                   July 2010


       SOCIALCODE-value =  text


   Example:

     socialCode;type=geek:"s: a--"

           [Which means "I'm average size, and my age is 20-24."]


2.6.  Property: interest

   Purpose:  Lists the vCard owner's interests (social, recreational,
       technical, etc.).  This allows users to identify others with
       common interests.


   Value type:  One or more text values separated by a COMMA character
       (ASCII decimal 44).


   Cardinality:  (0,n)


   Special notes:  This property MAY include the parameter "TYPE" to
       group interests in categories.  TYPE might be used to separate
       "business" interests from "social" interests, for example.  There
       are no predefined values for "TYPE", here -- the types will be
       understood (or not) by the vCard users, and it's likely that an
       ad hoc taxonomy will develop, as has happened with social
       tagging.


   ABNF:

       INTEREST-param =  "VALUE=text" / pid-param / pref-param /
               any-param

       INTEREST-value =  text


   Example:

     interest;type=business:Internet standards,consulting,job offers
     interest;type=social:friends and family,new friends
     interest;type=hobby:model trains,reading Sci Fi,travel
     interest;type=music:classical,jazz,folk,opera

2.7.  Property: XX

   Template for adding another property.  Remove this paragraph.  (This
   will also hold some references for the time being: [RFC2425]
   [RFC2426] [RFC2739] [RFC4770] )

   Purpose:  Purpose here.


   Value type:  A single text value.


   Cardinality:  (0,n)


   Special note:  Remove this section if there are no notes.


   ABNF:

       XX-param =  "VALUE=text" / pid-param / pref-param /
               any-param

       XX-value =  text
