A Uniform Resource Name Namespace for the Device Identity and the Mobile
                       Equipment Identity (MEID)
		draft-atarius-dispatch-meid-urn-04.txt

Abstract

   This document allows a Mobile Equipment Identity (MEID) to be used as
   a Uniform Resource Name (URN).  The document does so by registering a
   URN namespace for MEIDs.  The structure of an MEID is 15 hexadecimal
   encoded digits long and is defined in 3GPP2 to uniquely identify each
   individual mobile equipment (e.g., a handset or mobile phone).  The
   Third Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) has a requirement to
   be able to use an MEID as a URN.  This document fulfills that
   requirement.

1.  Introduction

   This specification specifies a URN namespace for 3GPP2 and a
   Namespace Specific String (NSS) for the MEID as per the namespace
   registration requirement in [RFC3406].  The NID (Namespace
   Identifier) '3gpp2' is for identities used in 3GPP2 networks.  The
   MEID is managed by the 3GPP2, so this NID is managed by the 3GPP2.
   Whilst this specification currently specifies only the MEID NSS under
   the '3gpp2' NID, additional NSS under the '3gpp2' NID may be
   specified in the future by the 3GPP2 using the procedure for URN NSS
   changes and additions (currently through the publication of future
   Informational RFCs approved by IETF conensus).

   The MEID is 15 hexadecimal digits long and includes a manufacturer
   code of 8 hexadecimal digits and the serial number of 6 hexadecimal
   digits plus a hexadecimal digit as a check digit.

   The manufacturer code identifies the mobile equipment manufacturer.
   A manufacturer can be assigned more that one manufacturer code.  The
   serial number uniquely identifies each mobile equipment within the
   manufacturer code.  The check digit is used as assurance of integrity

   in error-prone operations, e.g. when used with certain types of
   readers during inventory management operations.  The check digit is
   not transmitted.

   The information here is meant to be a concise guide for those wishing
   to use the MEID as a URN.  Nothing in this document should be
   construed to override [S.R0048-A] that defines the MEID.

   An NSS for the MEID is defined under the '3gpp2' NID.  The 3GPP2 is
   responsible for the NSS 'meid'.

   An MEID is an identifier under the '3gpp2' NID that uniquely
   identifies mobile equipment used in 3GPP2 defined networks.

   The representation of the MEID is a specific number of hexadecimal
   digits, as described in [S.R0048-A].

   The formal definition of a URN with 'meid' NSS contains one meidval
   with the formal definition according to the following ABNF [RFC5234]:

   meidval =  Manufacturer Code "-" Serial Number
   Manufacturer Code      = 8HEX
   Serial Number          = 6HEX

   The <future-3gpp2-specifier> and <3gpp2-defined-nonempty> can
   comprise any ASCII characters compliant with URN syntax in [RFC5234].

   Additional NSS may be added for future identifiers if needed by the
   3GPP2 by using the procedures for URN NSS changes and additions
   (currently through the publication of future Informational RFCs
   approved by IETF censensus).

   Relevant ancillary documentation: See 3G Mobile Equipment Identifier
   [S.R0048-A].

Internet-Draft               MEID Based URN                   	May 2014


   Identifier uniqueness considerations: Identifiers in the '3gpp2' NID
   are defined and assigned by the 3GPP2 or an agency appointed by 3GPP2
   after ensuring that the URNs to be assigned are unique.  Uniqueness
   is achieved by checking against the IANA registry of previously
   assigned names.

   Procedures are in place to ensure that each MEID is uniquely assigned
   by the mobile equipment manufacturer so that it is guaranteed to
   uniquely identify that particular mobile equipment.

   Identifier persistence considerations: The 3GPP2 is committed to
   maintaining uniqueness and persistence of all resources identified by
   assigned URNs.

   As the NID sought is '3gpp2', and 3GPP2 is the long standing acronym
   for the standards organization which includes the mobile phone
   operators, the URN should also persist indefinitely (at least as long
   as there is a need for its use).  The assignment process guarantees
   that names are not reassigned.  The binding between the name and its
   resource is permanent.

   The Manufacturer Code and Serial Number portions of the MEID are
   permanently stored in the Mobile Equipment so they remain persistent
   as long as the Mobile Equipment exists.  The process for Manufacturer
   Code and Serial Number assignment is documented in [SC.R4002-0] and
   the Manufacturer Code and Serial Number values once assigned are not
   re-assigned to other mobile equipments.

   Process of identifier assignment: The 3GPP2 or its approved agency
   will manage the <NSS> (including '3gpp2'), and <future-
   3gpp2-specifier> identifier resources to maintain uniqueness.  The
   process for MEID assignment is documented in [SC.R4002-0].

   Process for identifier resolution: Since the '3gpp2' NSS is not
   currently globally resolvable, this is not applicable.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence: Two 3GPP2 MEID URNs are equivalent if
   they have the same 'meidval' and the same parameter values in the
   same sequential order.  All of these comparisons are to be case-
   insensitive.

   Any identifier in '3gpp2' NSS can be compared using the normal
   mechanisms for percent-encoded UTF-8 strings (see [RFC3629]).

   Conformance with URN Syntax: The string representation of the '3gpp2'
   NID and of the MEID NSS is fully compatible with the URN syntax (see
   [RFC2141]).

Internet-Draft               MEID Based URN                   	May 2014


   Validation Mechanism: The MEID can be validated using the mechanism
   defined in [S.R0048-A].

   Scope: 3GPP2 URN is global in scope.

5.  Specification

5.1.  MEID Parameters

   The optional 'ext-meid' field in the ABNF are included for
   extensibility of the MEID NSS, for example if the MEID format is
   extended in the future.  In this case the 'ext-meid' would be further
   defined to represent the syntax of the extended MEID format.  Any
   change to the format specified here requires the use of the procedure
   for URN NSS changes and additions (currently the publication of a
   future Informational RFCs approved by IETF consensus).

   The procedure how to use 3GPP2 MEID URN as an instance ID is similar
   to the procedure for using GSMA IMEI URN as an instance ID
   [I-D.allen-dispatch-imei-urn-as-instanceid], with the exception that
   3GPP2 MEID does not have any software version.  An example of 3GPP2
   MEID URN is:

   urn:3gpp2:meid:A04B0D56-02A7E3;

5.2.  MEID Format

5.2.1.  Manufacturer Code

   The manufacturer code is an 8 hexadecimal digit value.  The
   manufacturer code identifies the mobile equipment manufacturer.  The
   manufacturer code is chosen from a range of values allocated to the
   mobile equipment manufacturer in order to uniquely identify the
   mobile equipment.

5.2.2.  Serial Number

   The serial number is a 6 hexadecimal digit value.  The serial number
   identifies equipment within the manufacturer code.

5.2.3.  Check Digit

   This is a single hexadecimal digit (bits 1-4 of octet 8) and is used
   as assurance of integrity in error-prone operations, e.g. when used
   with certain types of readers during inventory management operations.
   The check digit is not transmitted by the mobile equipment.

5.2.4.  Hexidecimal Encoding

   The MEID format is 15 hexadecimal digits encoded in 8 octets as
   defined in [S.R0048-A].  The following figure is an abstract
   representation of a hexidecimal encoded MEID stored in memory (the
   actual storage format in memory is implementation specific).  In this
   figure, the most significant digit of the Manufacturer Code is
   encoded in the bits 1-4 of octet 1.  Bits 5-8 of octet 8 are zero-
   padded, since the bits 1-4 are only needed to encode the Check Digit.
   The most significant digit of the Serial Number is encoded in the
   bits 1-4 of octet 5.  When MEID is included in a cellular signaling
   message, the Check Digit is omitted and the first 7 Octets in the
   following figure are only transmitted.

6.  Community considerations

   3GPP2 defined mobile equipment will be interoperating with Internet
   devices for a variety of voice and data communication services.  To
   do this, they need to make use of Internet protocols that will
   operate end to end between mobile equipments in 3GPP2 network and
   mobile equipments in general.  Some of these protocols require the
   use of URNs as identifiers.  Within the 3GPP2 networks, mobile
   equipments are identified by their MEID.  Internet users will need to
   be able to receive and include the 3GPP2 URN in various Internet
   protocol elements to facilitate communication between general
   Internet devices and 3GPP2 mobile equipments.  Thus the existence and
   syntax of these namespaces needs to be available to the general
   Internet community and the namespace needs to be reserved with IANA
   in order to guarantee uniqueness and prevent potential namespace
   conflicts both within the Internet and within 3GPP2 networks.
   Conversely, Internet implementations will not generally possess MEID
   identifiers.  The identifiers generated by such implementations will
   typically be URNs within namespaces other than '3gpp2', and may,
   depending on context, even be non-URN URIs.  Implementations are
   advised to be ready to process URIs other than '3gpp2' namespaced
   URNs, so as to aid in interoperability.

Internet-Draft               MEID Based URN                   	May 2014


7.  Namespace considerations

   A URN was considered the most appropriate URI to represent the MEID
   as this identifier may be used and transported similarly to the
   Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) which is defined as a URN in
   [RFC4122].  Since specifications for protocols that are used to
   transport device identifiers often require the device identifier to
   be globally unique and in the URN format, it is necessary that the
   URN formats are defined to represent the MEID.

8.  IANA considerations

   In accordance with BCP 66 [RFC3406], IANA is asked to register the
   Formal URN namespace '3gpp2' in the Registry of URN namespaces and
   sub namespaces, using the registration template presented in
   Section 4 of this document.

9.  Security considerations

   MEIDs (with the check digit) are displayable on most 3GPP2 mobile
   equipments and in many cases are printed on the case within the
   battery compartment.  Anyone with brief physical access to the mobile
   device can therefore easily obtain the MEID.  Therefore MEIDs MUST
   NOT be used as security capabilities (identifiers whose mere
   possession grants access).  Unfortuantely there are currently
   examples of some applications which are using the MEID for
   authorization.  Also some service provider's customer service
   departments have been known to use knowledge of the MEID as "proof"
   that the caller is the legitimate owner of the mobile device.  Both
   of these are inappropriate uses of the MEID.

   Since the MEID is permanently assigned to the mobile equipment and is
   not modified when the ownership of the mobile equipment changes,
   (even upon a complete software reload of the mobile equipment), the
   MEID URN MUST NOT be used as a user identifier or user address by an
   application.  Using the MEID to identify a user or as a user address
   could result in communications destined for a previous owner of a
   device being received by the new device owner or allow the new device
   owner to access information or services owned by the previous device
   owner.

   Additionally, since the MEID identifies the mobile equipment, it
   potentially could be used to identify and track users for the
   purposes of survellience and call data mining if sent in the clear.

   Since the MEID is personally identifiable information, uses of the
   MEID URN with IETF protocols require a specification and IETF expert
   review in order to ensure that the privacy concerns are appropriately

   addressed.  Protocols carrying the MEID URN SHOULD at a minimum use
   strongly hop-by-hop encrypted channels and that it is RECOMMENDED
   that end-to-end encryption is used.
