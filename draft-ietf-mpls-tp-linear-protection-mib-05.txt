Internet-Draft       MPLS-TP Linear Protection MIB       August 03, 2015


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols. In particular it defines
   objects for managing MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Linear
   Protection.

   This MIB module should be used for configuring and managing the MPLS
   TP linear protection for MPLS TP LSPs.

   At the time of writing, SNMP SET is no longer recommended as a way to
   configure MPLS networks as was described in [RFC3812].  However,
   since the MIB modules specified in this document are intended to work
   in parallel with the MIB modules for MPLS specified in [RFC3812],	
   certain objects defined here are specified with MAX-ACCESS of read-
   write or read-create so that specifications of the base tables in
   [RFC3812] and the new MIB modules in this document are consistent.
   Although the examples described in Section 7 specify means to
   configure OAM identifiers for MPLS-TP tunnels, this should be seen as
   indicating how the MIB values would be returned in the specified
   circumstances having been configured by alternative means.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

    [RFC6378] defines the protocol to provide a linear protection
    switching mechanism for MPLS transport profile with protection

    domain as point-to-point LSP. The detailed protocol specification of
    MPLS transport profile linear protection is described in [RFC6378].
    This document specifies a MIB module for the LER that supports MPLS
    TP Linear protection and a MIB module that defines textual
    conventions.


5.  Structure of the MIB Module

5.1.  Textual Conventions

    The following new textual conventions are defined in a separate MIB
    module in this document

       MplsLpsReq
       MplsLpsFpathPath
       MplsLpsCommand

5.2. The MPLS TP Linear Protection Subtree

   MPLS-LPS-MIB is the MIB module defined in this document, and it is
   put under mplsStdMIB.

5.3. The Notifications Subtree

   Notifications are defined to inform the management station about
   switchover and mode mismatch of linear protection switching group.
   Two notifications are defined for this purpose.  The notification,
   mplsLpsEventSwitchover is to inform the management station about the
   switchover of the active path and the notification
   mplsLpsEventModeMismatch is to inform the management station about
   the mismatch in the revertive mode across the end point of the
   protection domain.

5.4.  The Table Structures

   The MPLS TP Linear protection MIB module has four tables.  The tables
   are as follows

   o mplsLpsConfigTable

      This table is used to configure MPLS TP Linear protection
      switching Group. The protection switching group is identified by
      mplsLpsConfigGroupName. The other attributes in this table can be
      used to configure properties that are specific to the protection
      switching group.

   o mplsLpsStatusTable
 


Smiler et al.          Expires February 04, 2016                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft       MPLS-TP Linear Protection MIB       August 03, 2015


      This table provides the current status information of mpls linear
      protection groups that have been configured on the system. When a
      protection group is configured or deleted in the
      mplsLpsConfigTable, then the corresponding row of that session in
      the mplsLpsStatusTable is, respectively, automatically created or
      deleted.

   o mplsLpsMeConfigTable

      This table is used to associate the Maintenance Entities (MEs) to
      the protection switching group. The ME is identified by
      mplsOamIdMegIndex, mplsOamIdMeIndex and mplsOamIdMeMpIndex.


   o mplsLpsMeStatusTable

      This table provides the current information about the protection
      state of MEs that have been configured on the system. When a
      ME configured or deleted in the mplsLpsMeConfigTable, then the
      corresponding row of that session in the mplsLpsMeStatusTable
      is, respectively, automatically created or deleted.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

6.1. Relationship to the MPLS OAM maintenance identifiers MIB module

   The mplsLpsMeConfigTable entry is extended by entry in the
   mplsOamIdMeTable [MPLS-OAM-ID-STD-MIB] defined in draft-ietf-mpls-tp-
   oam-id-mib. Note that the nature of the 'extends' relationship is a
   sparse augmentation so that the entry in the mplsLpsMeConfigTable has
   the same index values as the entry in the mplsOamIdMeTable. Each time
   that an entry is created in the mplsOamIdMeTable for which the LER
   supports MPLS TP Linear protection a row is created automatically in
   the mplsLpsMeConfigTable.

7. Example of Protection switching configuration for MPLS-TP TE tunnel

      This example considers the protection group configuration on a
      head-end LSR to provide protection for a co-routed bidirectional
      MPLS tunnel.
      Only relevant objects which are applicable for protection group
      identifiers of co-routed MPLS tunnel are illustrated here.

         In mplsOamIdMegTable:
         {
          -- MEG index (Index to the table)
            mplsOamIdMegIndex                 = 1,
            mplsOamIdMegName                  = "MEG1",

            mplsOamIdMegOperatorType          = ipCompatible (1),
            mplsOamIdMegServiceType           = lsp (1),
            mplsOamIdMegMpLocation            = perNode(1),
          -- Mandatory parameters needed to activate the row go here
            mplsOamIdMegRowStatus             = createAndGo (4)
         }

      This will create an entry in the mplsOamIdMegTable to protect 
      the MPLS tunnel.

      The following ME table is used to associate the path information
      to a MEG.

         In mplsOamIdMeTable:
         {
            -- ME index (Index to the table)
             mplsOamIdMeIndex                  = 1,
            -- MP index (Index to the table)
             mplsOamIdMeMpIndex                = 1,
             mplsOamIdMeName                   = "ME1",
             mplsOamIdMeMpIfIndex              = 0,
             -- Source MEP id is derived from the IP compatible MPLS
             -- tunnel
             mplsOamIdMeSourceMepIndex         = 0,
             -- Source MEP id is derived from the IP compatible MPLS
             -- tunnel
             mplsOamIdMeSinkMepIndex           = 0,
             mplsOamIdMeMpType                 = mep (1),
             mplsOamIdMeMepDirection           = down (2),
             mplsOamIdMeProactiveOamPhbTCValue = 0,
             mplsOamIdMeOnDemandOamPhbTCValue  = 0,
            --  RowPointer MUST point to the first accessible column
            -- of an MPLS tunnel
             mplsOamIdMeServicePointer         = mplsTunnelName.1.1.1.2,
            -- Mandatory parameters needed to activate the row go here
             mplsOamIdMeRowStatus              = createAndGo (4)
         }

       The below table associates the MEs with protection switching
       groups.   
         In mplsLpsConfigTable:
         mplsLpsConfigEntry ::= SEQUENCE {
           -- Group index
           mplsLpsConfigGroupIndex  = 1,
           mplsLpsConfigGroupName   = "PGGroup1",
           mplsLpsConfigMode        = onePlusOne (1),
           -- Mandatory parameters needed to activate the row go here
           mplsLpsConfigRowStatus   = createAndGo (4)

9.  Security Considerations


   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some networks in
   a non-secure environment without proper protection can have a
 


Smiler et al.          Expires February 04, 2016               [Page 26]

Internet-Draft       MPLS-TP Linear Protection MIB       August 03, 2015


   negative effect on network operations.  These are the tables and
   objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   - mplsLpsConfigTable, mplsLpsStatusTable, mplsLpsMeConfigTable and
   mplsLpsMeStatusTable collectively show the MPLS Linear Protection
   characteristics. If an Administrator does not want to reveal this
   information, then these tables should be considered
   sensitive/vulnerable.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even
   if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), there
   is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access
   and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB
   module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by
   the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming	
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for	
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)	
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826]. Implementations	
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)	
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH	
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].


   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is not
   recommended.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

10.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an OID for the MIB module from the "MIB
   Transmission Group - MPLS STD" sub-registry of the "Internet-standard
   MIB - Transmission Group" registry for the MPLS Linear Protection MIB
   module specified in this document.
