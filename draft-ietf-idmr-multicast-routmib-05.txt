Status of this Memo

This document is an Internet Draft.  Internet Drafts are working
documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its Areas, and
its Working Groups.  Note that other groups may also distribute working
documents as Internet Drafts.

1.  Introduction

This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management Information
Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
community.  In particular, it describes managed objects used for
managing IP Multicast Routing [5], independent of the specific multicast
routing protocol [6,7,8,9,10] in use.  Managed objects specific to
particular multicast routing protocols are specified elsewhere.

2.  Revision History

A record of changes which will be removed before publication.

26 March

(1)  added ipMRouteInterfaceProtocol.

     ipMRouteNextHopClosestMemberHops, and ipMRouteDifferentInIfIndexes
     to ipMRouteDifferentInIfPacket.

3.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

The SNMP Network Management Framework presently consists of three major
components.  They are:

o    RFC 1902 [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
     describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

o    STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] defines MIB-II, the core set of managed
     objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

o    RFC 1157 [3] and RFC 1905 [4] which define two versions of the
     protocol used for network access to managed objects.

The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
experimentation and evaluation.


3.1.  Object Definitions

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are defined
using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the
SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
an administratively assigned name.  The object type together with an
object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of
the object.  For human convenience, we often use a textual string,
termed the descriptor, to refer to the object type.

4.  Overview

This MIB module contains one scalar and four tables.  The tables are:

(1)  the IP Multicast Route Table containing multicast routing
     information for IP datagrams sent by particular sources to the IP
     multicast groups known to a router;

(2)  the IP Multicast Routing Next Hop Table containing information on
     the next hops for the routing IP multicast datagrams.  Each entry
     is one of a list of next hops on outgoing interfaces for particular
     sources sending to a particular multicast group address."

(3)  the IP Multicast Routing Interface Table containing multicast
     routing information specific to interfaces.

(4)  the IP Multicast Scoped Boundary Table containing the scoped
     multicast address boundaries.
