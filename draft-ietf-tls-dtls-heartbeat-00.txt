  Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security
                       (DTLS) Heartbeat Extension
                  draft-ietf-tls-dtls-heartbeat-00.txt

Abstract

   This document describes the Heartbeat Extension for the Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
   protocol.

   The Heartbeat Extension provides a new protocol for TLS/DTLS allowing
   the usage of keep-alive functionality without performing a
   renegotiation and a basis for path maximum transmission unit (PMTU)
   discovery for DTLS.

Internet-Draft        TLS/DTLS Heartbeat Extension             June 2010


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   This document describes the Heartbeat Extension for the Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
   protocols, as defined in [RFC5246] and [RFC4347].

   DTLS is designed to secure traffic running on top of unreliable
   transport protocols.  Usually such protocols have no session
   management.  The only mechanism available at the DTLS layer to figure
   out if a peer is still alive is performing a costly renegotiation.
   If the application uses unidirectional traffic there is no other way.
   Furthermore, DTLS needs to perform path maximum transmission unit
   (PMTU) discovery but has no specific message type to realize it
   without affecting user message transfer.

   TLS is based on reliable protocols but there is not necessarily a
   feature available to keep the connection alive without continuous
   data transfer.

   The Heartbeat Extension as described in this document overcomes these
   limitations.  The user can use the new HeartbeatRequest message which
   has to be answered by the peer with a HeartbeartResponse immediately.
   To perform PMTU discovery HeartbeatRequest messages containing
   padding can be used as described in [RFC4821] for the Stream Control
   Transmission Protocol (SCTP) using the padding chunk (PAD-chunk)
   defined in [RFC4820].

1.2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Heartbeat Hello Extension

   The support of Heartbeats is indicated with Hello Extensions.  A peer
   can not only indicate that its implementation supports Heartbeats, it
   can also choose whether it is willing to receive and respond or only
   to send them.  This decision can be changed with every renegotiation.
   HeartbeatRequests MUST NOT be sent to a peer denying acceptance.

   enum {
      peer_allowed_to_send(1),
      peer_not_allowed_to_send(2),
      (255)
   } HeartbeatMode;

   struct {
      HeartbeatMode mode;
   } HeartbeatExtension;


3.  Heartbeat Protocol

   The Heartbeat protocol is a new protocol on top of the Record Layer.
   The protocol itself consists of two message types: HeartbeatRequest
   and HeartbeatResponse.

   enum {
      heartbeat_request(1),
      heartbeat_response(2),
      (255)
   } HeartbeatMessageType;

   Like the ChangeCipherSpec message, a HeartbeatRequest message can
   arrive at any time during the lifetime of a connection.  Whenever a
   HeartbeatRequest message is received, it has to be answered with a
   corresponding HeartbeatResponse message immediately.

   However, a HeartbeatRequest message SHOULD NOT be sent during
   handshakes.

   There MUST NOT be more than one HeartbeatRequest message in flight at
   a time.

   When using DTLS, HeartbeatRequest messages MUST be retransmitted
   using the simple timeout and retransmission scheme DTLS uses for
   flights.  In particular, after a number of retransmissions without
   receiving a corresponding HeartbeatResponse message having the
   expected payload the DTLS connection SHOULD be terminated.  The
   threshold used for this SHOULD be the same as for DTLS handshake
   messages.  Please note, that after the timer supervising a
   HeartbeatRequest messages expires, this message is not longer
   considered in flight.  Therefore the HeartbeatRequest message is
   eligible for retransmission.

   When using TLS, HeartbeatRequest messages only need to be sent once.
   The transport layer will handle retransmissions.  If no corresponding
   HeartbeatResponse message has been received after a user configured

   amount of time, the TLS connection SHOULD be terminated.


4.  Heartbeat Request and Response Messages

   The Heartbeat protocol messages consist of their type and an
   arbitrary payload and padding.

   struct {
      HeartbeatMessageType type;
      opaque payload<0..2^14-5>;
      opaque padding<0..2^14-5>;
   } HeartbeatMessage;

   The length of payload and padding in total MUST NOT exceed 2^14-5
   bytes.

   When a HeartbeatRequest message is received, a corresponding
   HeartbeatResponse message MUST be sent carrying an exact copy of the
   payload of the HeartbeatRequest.  The padding of the received
   HeartbeatRequest message MUST be ignored.  It MUST NOT be included in
   the HeartbeatResponse message, i.e. the padding field of the
   HeartbeatResponse message MUST have a length of zero.

   If a received HeartbeatResponse message does not contain the expected
   payload the message MUST be discarded silently.  If it does contain
   the expected payload the retransmission timer MUST be stopped.


5.  IANA Considerations

   The extension, content and message types have to be assigned by IANA.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not add any additional security considerations in
   addition to the ones given in [RFC4347] and [RFC5246].
