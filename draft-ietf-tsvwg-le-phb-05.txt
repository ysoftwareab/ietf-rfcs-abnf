                A Lower Effort Per-Hop Behavior (LE PHB)
                       draft-ietf-tsvwg-le-phb-05

Abstract

   This document specifies properties and characteristics of a Lower
   Effort (LE) per-hop behavior (PHB).  The primary objective of this LE
   PHB is to protect best-effort (BE) traffic (packets forwarded with
   the default PHB) from LE traffic in congestion situations, i.e., when
   resources become scarce, best-effort traffic has precedence over LE
   traffic and may preempt it.  Alternatively, packets forwarded by the
   LE PHB can be associated with a scavenger service class, i.e., they
   scavenge otherwise unused resources only.  There are numerous uses
   for this PHB, e.g., for background traffic of low precedence, such as
   bulk data transfers with low priority in time, non time-critical
   backups, larger software updates, web search engines while gathering
   information from web servers and so on.  This document recommends a
   standard DSCP value for the LE PHB.  This specification obsoletes RFC
   3662 and updates the DSCP recommended in RFC 4594 and RFC 8325 to use
   the DSCP assigned in this specification.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a Differentiated Services per-hop behavior
   [RFC2474] called "Lower Effort" (LE), which is intended for traffic
   of sufficiently low urgency that all other traffic takes precedence
   over the LE traffic in consumption of network link bandwidth.  Low
   urgency traffic has a low priority for timely forwarding, which does
   not necessarily imply that it is generally of minor importance.  From
   this viewpoint, it can be considered as a network equivalent to a
   background priority for processes in an operating system.  There may
   or may not be memory (buffer) resources allocated for this type of
   traffic.

   Some networks carry traffic for which delivery is considered
   optional; that is, packets of this type of traffic ought to consume
   network resources only when no other traffic is present.  In this
   point of view, packets forwarded by the LE PHB scavenge otherwise
   unused resources only, which led to the name "scavenger service" in
   early Internet2 deployments (Appendix A).  Other commonly used names
   for LE PHB type services are "Lower-than-best-effort" or "Less-than-
   best-effort".  Alternatively, the effect of this type of traffic on
   all other network traffic is strictly limited ("no harm" property).
   This is distinct from "best-effort" (BE) traffic since the network
   makes no commitment to deliver LE packets.  In contrast, BE traffic
   receives an implied "good faith" commitment of at least some
   available network resources.  This document proposes a Lower Effort
   Differentiated Services per-hop behavior (LE PHB) for handling this
   "optional" traffic in a differentiated services node.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Applicability

   A Lower Effort PHB is applicable for many applications that otherwise
   use best-effort delivery.  More specifically, it is suitable for
   traffic and services that can tolerate strongly varying throughput
   for their data flows, especially periods of very low throughput or
   even starvation (i.e., long interruptions due to significant or even
   complete packet loss).  Therefore, an application sending an LE

Internet-Draft              Lower Effort PHB                   July 2018


   marked flow needs to be able to tolerate short or (even very) long
   interruptions due to the presence of severe congestion conditions
   during the transmission of the flow.  Thus, there ought to be an
   expectation that packets of the LE PHB could be excessively delayed
   or dropped when any other traffic is present.  The LE PHB is suitable
   for sending traffic of low urgency across a Differentiated Services
   (DS) domain or DS region.

   Just like best-effort traffic, LE traffic SHOULD be congestion
   controlled (i.e., use a congestion controlled transport or implement
   an appropriate congestion control method [RFC8085]).  Since LE
   traffic could be starved completely for a longer period of time,
   transport protocols or applications (and their related congestion
   control mechanisms) SHOULD be able to detect and react to such a
   situation and ought to resume the transfer as soon as possible.
   Congestion control is not only useful to let the flows within the LE
   behavior aggregate adapt to the available bandwidth that may be
   highly fluctuating, but is also essential if LE traffic is mapped to
   the default PHB in DS domains that do not support LE.

   Use of the LE PHB might assist a network operator in moving certain
   kinds of traffic or users to off-peak times.  Alternatively, or in
   addition, packets can be designated for the LE PHB when the goal is
   to protect all other packet traffic from competition with the LE
   aggregate while not completely banning LE traffic from the network.
   An LE PHB SHOULD NOT be used for a customer's "normal Internet"
   traffic nor should packets be "downgraded" to the LE PHB instead of
   being dropped, particularly when the packets are unauthorized
   traffic.  The LE PHB is expected to have applicability in networks
   that have at least some unused capacity at certain periods.

   The LE PHB allows networks to protect themselves from selected types
   of traffic as a complement to giving preferential treatment to other
   selected traffic aggregates.  LE ought not to be used for the general
   case of downgraded traffic, but could be used by design, e.g., to
   protect an internal network from untrusted external traffic sources.
   In this case there is no way for attackers to preempt internal (non
   LE) traffic by flooding.  Another use case in this regard is
   forwarding of multicast traffic from untrusted sources.  Multicast
   forwarding is currently enabled within domains only for specific
   sources within a domain, but not for sources from anywhere in the
   Internet.  A main problem is that multicast routing creates traffic
   sources at (mostly) unpredictable branching points within a domain,
   potentially leading to congestion and packet loss.  In the case of
   multicast traffic packets from untrusted sources are forwarded as LE
   traffic, they will not harm traffic from non-LE behavior aggregates.
   A further related use case is mentioned in [RFC3754]: preliminary
   forwarding of non-admitted multicast traffic.

   There is no intrinsic reason to limit the applicability of the LE PHB
   to any particular application or type of traffic.  It is intended as
   an additional traffic engineering tool for network administrators.
   For instance, it can be used to fill protection capacity of
   transmission links that is otherwise unused.  Some network providers
   keep link utilization below 50% to ensure that all traffic is
   forwarded without loss after rerouting caused by a link failure (cf.
   Section 6 of [RFC3439]).  LE marked traffic can utilize the normally
   unused capacity and will be preempted automatically in case of link
   failure when 100% of the link capacity is required for all other
   traffic.  Ideally, applications mark their packets as LE traffic,
   since they know the urgency of flows.

   Example uses for the LE PHB:

   o  For traffic caused by world-wide web search engines while they
      gather information from web servers.

   o  For software updates or dissemination of new releases of operating
      systems.

   o  For reporting errors or telemetry data from operating systems or
      applications.

   o  For backup traffic or non-time critical synchronization or
      mirroring traffic.

   o  For content distribution transfers between caches.

   o  For preloading or prefetching objects from web sites.

   o  For network news and other "bulk mail" of the Internet.

   o  For "downgraded" traffic from some other PHB when this does not
      violate the operational objectives of the other PHB.

   o  For multicast traffic from untrusted (e.g., non-local) sources.

4.  PHB Description

   The LE PHB is defined in relation to the default PHB (best-effort).
   A packet forwarded with the LE PHB SHOULD have lower precedence than
   packets forwarded with the default PHB, i.e., in the case of
   congestion, LE marked traffic SHOULD be dropped prior to dropping any
   default PHB traffic.  Ideally, LE packets SHOULD be forwarded only if
   no packet with any other PHB is awaiting transmission.

Internet-Draft              Lower Effort PHB                   July 2018


   A straightforward implementation could be a simple priority scheduler
   serving the default PHB queue with higher priority than the lower-
   effort PHB queue.  Alternative implementations may use scheduling
   algorithms that assign a very small weight to the LE class.  This,
   however, could sometimes cause better service for LE packets compared
   to BE packets in cases when the BE share is fully utilized and the LE
   share not.

   If a dedicated LE queue is not available, an active queue management
   mechanism within a common BE/LE queue could also be used.  This could
   drop all arriving LE packets as soon as certain queue length or
   sojourn time thresholds are exceeded.

   Since congestion control is also useful within the LE traffic class,
   Explicit Congestion Notification [RFC3168] SHOULD be used for LE
   packets, too.

5.  Traffic Conditioning Actions

   If possible, packets SHOULD be pre-marked in DS-aware end systems by
   applications due to their specific knowledge about the particular
   precedence of packets.  There is no incentive for DS domains to
   distrust this initial marking, because letting LE traffic enter a DS
   domain causes no harm.  Thus, any policing such as limiting the rate
   of LE traffic is not necessary at the DS boundary.

   As for most other PHBs an initial classification and marking can be
   also performed at the first DS boundary node according to the DS
   domain's own policies (e.g., as protection measure against untrusted
   sources).  However, non-LE traffic (e.g., BE traffic) SHOULD NOT be
   remarked to LE on a regular basis without consent or knowledge of the
   user.  See also remarks with respect to downgrading in Section 3 and
   Section 8.

6.  Recommended DS Codepoint

   The RECOMMENDED codepoint for the LE PHB is '000001'.

   Earlier specifications [RFC4594] recommended to use CS1 as codepoint
   (as mentioned in [RFC3662]).  This is problematic since it may cause
   a priority inversion in DiffServ domains that treat CS1 as originally
   proposed in [RFC2474], resulting in forwarding LE packets with higher
   precedence than BE packets.  Existing implementations SHOULD
   transition to use the unambiguous LE codepoint '000001' whenever
   possible.

   This particular codepoint was chosen due to measurements on the
   currently observable DSCP remarking behavior in the Internet



Bless                    Expires January 4, 2019                [Page 6]

   [ietf99-secchi].  Since some network domains set the former IP
   precedence bits to zero, it is possible that some other standardized
   DSCPs get mapped to the LE PHB DSCP if it were taken from the DSCP
   standards action pool 1 (xxxxx0).

7.  Deployment Considerations

   In order to enable LE support, DS nodes typically only need

   o  A BA classifier (Behavior Aggregate classifier, see [RFC2475])
      that classifies packets according to the LE DSCP

   o  A dedicated LE queue

   o  A suitable scheduling discipline, e.g., simple priority queueing

   Alternatively, implementations could use active queue management
   mechanisms instead of a dedicated LE queue, e.g., dropping all
   arriving LE packets when certain queue length or sojourn time
   thresholds are exceeded.

   Internet-wide deployment of the LE PHB is eased by the following
   properties:

   o  No harm to other traffic: since the LE PHB has the lowest
      forwarding priority it does not consume resources from other PHBs.
      Deployment across different provider domains with LE support
      causes no trust issues or attack vectors to existing (non LE)
      traffic.  Thus, providers can trust LE markings from end-systems,
      i.e., there is no need to police or remark incoming LE traffic.

   o  No PHB parameters or configuration of traffic profiles: the LE PHB
      itself possesses no parameters that need to be set or configured.
      Similarly, since LE traffic requires no admission or policing, it
      is not necessary to configure traffic profiles.

   o  No traffic conditioning mechanisms: the LE PHB requires no traffic
      meters, droppers, or shapers.  See also Section 5 for further
      discussion.

   Operators of DS domains that cannot or do not want to support the LE
   PHB should be aware that they violate the "no harm" property of LE.
   DS domains that do not offer support for the LE PHB support SHOULD
   NOT drop packets marked with the LE DSCP.  They SHOULD map packets
   with this DSCP to the default PHB and SHOULD preserve the LE DSCP
   marking.  See also Section 8 for further discussion of forwarding LE
   traffic with the default PHB instead.

8.  Remarking to other DSCPs/PHBs

   "DSCP bleaching", i.e., setting the DSCP to '000000' (default PHB) is
   NOT RECOMMENDED for this PHB.  This may cause effects that are in
   contrast to the original intent in protecting BE traffic from LE
   traffic (no harm property).  In the case that a DS domain does not
   support the LE PHB, its nodes SHOULD treat LE marked packets with the
   default PHB instead (by mapping the LE DSCP to the default PHB), but
   they SHOULD do so without remarking to DSCP '000000'.  The reason for
   this is that later traversed DS domains may then have still the
   possibility to treat such packets according to the LE PHB.

   Operators of DS domains that forward LE traffic within the BE
   aggregate need to be aware of the implications, i.e., induced
   congestion situations and quality-of-service degradation of the
   original BE traffic.  In this case, the LE property of not harming
   other traffic is no longer fulfilled.  To limit the impact in such
   cases, traffic policing of the LE aggregate MAY be used.

   In case LE marked packets are effectively carried within the default
   PHB (i.e., forwarded as best-effort traffic) they get a better
   forwarding treatment than expected.  For some applications and
   services, it is favorable if the transmission is finished earlier
   than expected.  However, in some cases it may be against the original
   intention of the LE PHB user to strictly send the traffic only if
   otherwise unused resources are available.  In case LE traffic is
   mapped to the default PHB, LE traffic may compete with BE traffic for
   the same resources and thus adversely affect the original BE
   aggregate.  Applications that want to ensure the lower precedence
   compared to BE traffic even in such cases SHOULD use additionally a
   corresponding Lower-than-Best-Effort transport protocol [RFC6297],
   e.g., LEDBAT [RFC6817].

   A DS domain that still uses DSCP CS1 for marking LE traffic
   (including Low Priority-Data as defined in [RFC4594] or the old
   definition in [RFC3662]) SHOULD remark traffic to the LE DSCP
   '000001' at the egress to the next DS domain.  This increases the
   probability that the DSCP is preserved end-to-end, whereas a CS1
   marked packet may be remarked by the default DSCP if the next domain
   is applying DiffServ-intercon [RFC8100].

9.  The Update to RFC 4594

   [RFC4594] recommended to use CS1 as codepoint in section 4.10,
   whereas CS1 was defined in [RFC2474] to have a higher precedence than
   CS0, i.e., the default PHB.  Consequently, DiffServ domains
   implementing CS1 according to [RFC2474] will cause a priority
   inversion for LE packets that contradicts with the original purpose

   the LE DSCP.

   o  Section 2.3 of [RFC4594] specifies: "In network segments that use
      IP precedence marking, only one of the two service classes can be
      supported, High-Throughput Data or Low-Priority Data.  We
      RECOMMEND that the DSCP value(s) of the unsupported service class
      be changed to 000xx1 on ingress and changed back to original
      value(s) on egress of the network segment that uses precedence
      marking.  For example, if Low-Priority Data is mapped to Standard
      service class, then 000001 DSCP marking MAY be used to distinguish
      it from Standard marked packets on egress."  This document removes
      this recommendation, because by using the herein defined LE DSCP
      such remarking is not necessary.  So even if Low-Priority Data is
      unsupported (i.e., mapped to the default PHB) the LE DSCP should
      be kept across the domain as RECOMMENDED in Section 8.

   and updates the following paragraph:

   "The above table assumes that packets marked with CS1 are treated as
   "less than best effort", such as the LE behavior described in
   [RFC3662].  However, the treatment of CS1 is implementation
   dependent.  If an implementation treats CS1 as other than "less than
   best effort", then the actual priority (or, more precisely, the per-
   hop-behavior) of the packets may be changed from what is intended.
   It is common for CS1 to be treated the same as DF, so applications
   and browsers using CS1 cannot assume that CS1 will be treated
   differently than DF [RFC7657].  However, it is also possible per
   [RFC2474] for CS1 traffic to be given better treatment than DF, thus
   caution should be exercised when electing to use CS1.  This is one of
   the cases where marking packets using these recommendations can make
   things worse."

   as follows:

   "The above table assumes that packets marked with LE are treated as
   lower effort (i.e., "less than best effort"), such as the LE behavior
   described in [RFCXXXX].  However, the treatment of LE is
   implementation dependent.  If an implementation treats LE as other
   than "less than best effort", then the actual priority (or, more
   precisely, the per- hop-behavior) of the packets may be changed from
   what is intended.  It is common for LE to be treated the same as DF,
   so applications and browsers using LE cannot assume that LE will be
   treated differently than DF [RFC7657]."

Internet-Draft              Lower Effort PHB                   July 2018


12.  IANA Considerations

   This document assigns the Differentiated Services Field Codepoint
   (DSCP) '000001' from the Differentiated Services Field Codepoints
   (DSCP) registry (https://www.iana.org/assignments/dscp-registry/dscp-
   registry.xhtml) (Pool 3, Codepoint Space xxxx01, Standards Action) to
   the LE PHB.  This document suggests to use a DSCP from Pool 3 in
   order to avoid problems for other PHB marked flows to become
   accidentally remarked as LE PHB, e.g., due to partial DSCP bleaching.
   See [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-iana-dscp-registry] for the request to re-
   classify Pool 3 for Standards Action.

   IANA is requested to update the registry as follows:

   o  Name: LE

   o  Value (Binary): 000001

   o  Value (Decimal): 1

   o  Reference: [RFC number of this memo]

13.  Security Considerations

   There are no specific security exposures for this PHB.  Since it
   defines a new class of low forwarding priority, remarking other
   traffic as LE traffic may lead to quality-of-service degradation of
   such traffic.  Thus, any attacker that is able to modify the DSCP of
   a packet to LE may carry out a downgrade attack.  See the general
   security considerations in [RFC2474] and [RFC2475].

   With respect to privacy, an attacker could use the information from
   the DSCP to infer that the transferred (probably even encrypted)
   content is considered of low priority or low urgency by a user, in
   case the DSCP was set on the user's request.  However, this disclosed
   information is only useful if some form of identification happened at
   the same time, see [RFC6973] for further details on general privacy
   threats.

Appendix A.  History of the LE PHB

   A first version of this PHB was suggested by Roland Bless and Klaus
   Wehrle in September 1999 [draft-bless-diffserv-lbe-phb-00], named "A
   Lower Than Best-Effort Per-Hop Behavior".  After some discussion in
   the DiffServ Working Group Brian Carpenter and Kathie Nichols
   proposed a "bulk handling" per-domain behavior and believed a PHB was
   not necessary.  Eventually, "Lower Effort" was specified as per-
   domain behavior and finally became [RFC3662].  More detailed
   information about its history can be found in Section 10 of
   [RFC3662].

   There are several other names in use for this type of PHB or
   associated service classes.  Well-known is the QBone Scavenger
   Service (QBSS) that was proposed in March 2001 within the Internet2
   QoS Working Group.  Alternative names are "Lower-than-best-effort"
   [carlberg-lbe-2001] or "Less-than-best-effort" [chown-lbe-2003].

Appendix B.  Acknowledgments

   Since text is borrowed from earlier Internet-Drafts and RFCs the co-
   authors of previous specifications are acknowledged here: Kathie
   Nichols and Klaus Wehrle.  David Black, Gorry Fairhurst, and Ruediger
   Geib provided helpful comments and suggestions.

Appendix C.  Change History
