Abstract

   Customers are frequently required to enter substantial amounts of
   information at an Internet merchant site in order to complete a
   purchase or other transaction, especially the first time they go
   there. A standard set of information fields is defined as the first
   version of an Electronic Commerce Modeling Language (ECML) so that
   this task can be more easily automated, for example by wallet
   software that could fill in fields.  Even for the manual data entry
   case, customers will be less confused by varying merchant sites if a
   substantial number adopt these standard fields.

1. Introduction


1.1 Background

   Today, numerous merchants are successfully conducting business on the
   Internet using HTML-based forms. The data formats used in these forms
   varies considerably from one merchant to another. End-users find the
   diversity confusing and the process of manually filling in these
   forms to be tedious.  The result is that many merchant forms,
   reportedly around two thirds, are abandoned during the fill in
   process.

   Software tools called wallets can help this situation.  A digital
   wallet is an application or service that assists consumers in
   conducting online transactions by allowing them to store billing,
   shipping, payment, and preference information and to use this
   information to automatically complete merchant interactions.  This
   greatly simplifies the check-out process and minimizes the need for a
   consumer to think about and complete a merchant's form every time.
   Digital wallets that fill forms have been successfully built into
   browsers, as proxy servers, as helper applications to browsers, as
   stand-alone applications, as browser plug-ins, and as server-based
   applications.  But the proliferation of electronic wallets has been
   hampered by the lack of standards.

   ECML (Electronic Commerce Modeling Language, <www.ecml.org>) Version
   1.1 provides a set of simple guidelines for web merchants that will
   enable electronic wallets from multiple vendors to fill in their web
   forms. The end-result is that more consumers will find shopping on
   the web to be easy and compelling.

   The set of fields documented herein was developed by the ECML
   Alliance which now includes, in alphabetic order, the following, the
   fifteen Steeting Committee members listed below and numerous General
   Members some of whom are listed on the ECML web site.

              4. Compaq (www.compaq.com)
              5. CyberCash (www.cybercash.com)

   The ECML fields were initially derived from and are consistent with
   the W3C P3P base data schema at

        <http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-P3P/basedata.html>.



1.2 Relationship to Other Standards

   ECML Version 1.1 is is a minor enhancement of Version 1.0.  See

   not a replacement or alternative to SSL/TLS [RFC 2246], SET [SET],
   XML [XML], or IOTP [draft-ietf-trade-iopt-protocol-07.txt]. These are
   important standards that provide functionality such as non-
   repudiatable transactions, automatable payment scheme selection, and
   smart card support.

   ECML may be used with any payment mechanism.  It simply allows a
   merchant to publish consistent simple web forms.

   Multiple wallets and multiple merchants interoperably support ECML.
   This is an open standard. ECML is designed to be simple.  It adds no
   new technology to the web.  A merchant can adopt ECML and gain the
   support of these multiple Wallets by making very simple changes to
   their site.  Use of ECML requires no license.



1.3 Areas Deferred to Future Versions

   Standardization of information fields transmitted from the merchant
   to the consumer including merchant identification, considerations for
   business purchasing cards, non-card payment mechanisms, wallet
   activation, shipping and fulfillment information, privacy related
   mechanisms, additional payment mechanisms, currency exchange, and any
   sort of "negotiation" were among the areas deferred to consideration
   in future versions.  Hidden or other special fields were minimized.

2. Field Definitions and Schemas

   The ECML Standard is primarily the definition and naming of fields.
   These fields can be encoded in a variety of syntaxes and protocols.

   Section 2.1 below lists and describes the fields, Section 2.2 gives
   additional notes on HTML usage of the fields, and the remaining
   subsections (2.3, 2.4, 2.5) provide an XML syntax and schemas for use
   with the fields.



2.1 Field List and Descriptions

   The fields are listed below along with the minimum data entry size to
   allow.  Note that these fields are hierarchically organized as
   indicated by the embedded underscore ("_") characters.  Appropriate
   consumer to merchant transmission mechanisms may use this to request
   and send aggregates, such as Ecom_Payment_Card_ExpDate to encompass
   all the date components or Ecom_ShipTo to encompass all the ship to
   components that the consumer is willing to provide.  The labeling,
   marshalling, unmarshalling of the components of such aggregates
   depends on the data transfer protocol used.



2.1.1 Field List

   IMPORTANT NOTE: "MIN" in the table below is the MINIMUM DATA SIZE TO
         ALLOW FOR ON DATA ENTRY.  It is NOT the minimum size for valid
         contents of the field and merchant software should, in most
         cases, be prepared to receive a longer or shorter value.
         Merchant dealing with areas where, for example, the
         state/province name or phone number is longer than the "Min"
         given below must obviously permit longer data entry.  In some
         cases, however, there is a maximum size that makes sense and
         where this is the case, it is documented in a Note for the
         field.

         this is documented in a Note for the field.



2.1.2 Field Foot Notes

   ( 1) For example: Mr., Mrs., Ms., Dr. This field is commonly not
   used.

   ( 2) May also be used for middle initial

   ( 3) For example: Ph.D., Jr. (Junior), 3rd, Esq. (Esquire). This
   field is commonly not used.

   ( 4) Address lines must be filled in the order line1, then line2,
   last line3.

   ( 5) 2 characters are the minimum for the US and Canada, other
   countries may require longer fields.  For the US use 2 character US
   Postal state abbreviation.

   ( 6) Minimum field lengths for Postal Code will vary based on
   international market served.  Use 5 character or 5+4 ZIP for the US
   and 6 character postal code for Canada.  The size given, 14, is
   believed to be the maximum required anywhere in the world.

   ( 7) Use [ISO 3166] standard two letter codes
   <http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/codlstp1.html> for
   country names.

   ( 8) 10 digits are the minimum for numbers local to the North

   number of smaller Caribbean and Pacific nations (but not Cuba)),
   other countries may require longer fields.  Telephone numbers are
   complicated by differing international access codes, variant
   punctuation of area/city codes within countries, confusion caused by
   the fact that the international access code in the NANP region is
   usually the same as the "country code" for that area (1), etc.  It
   will probably be necessary to use heuristics or human examination
   based on the telephone number and addresses given to figure out how
   to actually call a customer. It is recommend that an "x" be placed
   before extension numbers.

   ( 9) For example:  jsmith@example.com

   (10) The name of the cardholder.

   (11)  Use the first 4 letters of the association name: American
   Express=AMER; Diners Club=DINE; Discover=DISC; JCB=JCB;
   Mastercard=MAST; Visa=VISA.

   (12) Includes the check digit at end but no spaces or hyphens [ISO
   7812].  The Min given, 19, is the longest number permitted under the
   ISO standard.

   (13) An additional cardholder verification number printed on the card
   (but not embossed or recorded on the magnetic stripe) such as
   American Express' CIV, MasterCard's CVC2, and Visa's CVV2 values.

   (14) The day of the month. Values: 1-31.  A leading zero is ignored
   so, for example, 07 is valid for the seventh day of the month.

   (15) The month of the year.  Jan - 1, Feb - 2, March - 3, etc.;
   Values: 1-12.  A leading zero is ignored so, for example, 07 is avlid
   for July.

   (16) The value in the wallet cell is always four digits, e.g., 1999,
   2000, 2001, ...

   (17) A space separated list of protocols available in connection with
   the specified card.  Initial list of case insensitive tokens: none,
   set, setcert, iotp, ach, and echeck.  "Set" indicates usable with SET
   protocol (i.e., is in a SET wallet) but does not have a SET
   certificate.  "Setcert" indicates same but does have a set
   certificate.  "iotp" indicates the IOTP protocol [draft-ietf-trade-
   iotp-protocol-07.txt] is supported at the customer. "ach" indicates
   that an Automated Clearing House based check payment system is
   available.  "echeck" indicates that the eCheck protocol [eCheck] is
   supported at the customer.  "None" indicates that automatic field
   fill is operating but there is no SET wallet or the card is not
   entered in any SET wallet.

   (18) A unique order ID generated by the consumer software.

   (19) URI indicating version of this set of fields.  Usually a hidden
   field.  Equal to "http://www.ecml.org/version/1.1" for this version.

   (20) A string to identify the source and version of the form fill
   software that is acting on behalf of the user.  Should contain
   company and/or product name and version.  Example "Wallets Inc.,
   SuperFill, v42.7".  Usually a hidden field.

   (21) A flag to indicate that this web-page/aggregate is the final one
   for this transaction.  Usually a hidden field.



2.2 Use in HTML

   The normal use of ECML is HTML is as a form with input ield names
   identical to those given in section 2.1 above.  In general, <INPUT>
   tags with type text, hidden, and password must be supported as must
   <SELECT> tags.

   Internationalization in HTML is limited.  The information available
   with the HTML form Method as to character set and language may be
   used.  Alternatively, these may be over-ridden for the entire form
   reponse with the HTML only Ecom_CharSet and/or Ecom_Language fields.



2.3 An ECML 1.1 XML DTD

   Below is an XML DTD that can be used for the XML encoding of ECML
   v1.1 Fields.

   For internationaization of [XML] ECML, use the general XML character
   encoding provisions, which mandate support of UTF-8 and UTF-16 and
   permit support of other character sets, and the xml:lang attribute
   which may be used to specify language information.

3. Using The Fields

   To conform to this document, the field names must be structured as
   listed in section 2 above. Note: this does not impose any restriction
   on the user visible labeling of fields, just on their names as used
   in communication with the merchant.



3.1 Presentation of the Fields

   There is no necessary implication as to the order or manner of
   presentation.  Some merchants may wish to ask for more information,
   some less by omitting fields.  Some merchants may ask for the
   information they want in one interaction or web page, others may ask
   for parts of the information at different times in multiple
   interactions or different web pages.  For example, it is common to
   ask for "ship to" information earlier, so shipping cost can be
   computed, before the payment method information.  Some merchants may
   require that all the information they request be provided while other
   make much information optional.  Etc.

   There is no way with version 1.1 of ECML to indicate what fields the
   merchant considers mandatory.  From the point of view of customer
   software, all fields are optional to complete.  However, the merchant
   may give an error or re-present a request for information if some
   field it requires is not completed, just as it may if a field is
   completed in a manner it considers erroneous.



3.2 Methods and Flow of Setting the Fields

   There are a variety of methods of communication possible between the
   customer and the merchant by which the merchant can indicate what
   fields they want that the consumer can provide.  Probably the easiest
   to use for currently deployed software is as fields in an [HTML] form
   (see section 2.2).  Other possibilities are to use the IOTP
   Authenticate transaction [draft-ietf-trade-iotp-protocol-07.txt], an
   [XML] exchange, or proprietary protocols.

   User action or the appearance of the Ecom_SchemaVersion field are
   examples of triggers that could be used to initiate a facility
   capable of filling in fields.  Because some wallets may require user
   activtaion, there should be at least one user visible Ecom field on
   every page with any Ecom fields present.  It is also required by this
   specification that the Ecom_SchemaVersion field, which is usually a
   hidden field, be included on every web page that has any Ecom fields.

   Because web pages can load very slowly, it may not be clear to an


D. Eastlake, T. Goldstein                                      [Page 13]


INTERNET-DRAFT              ECom Field Names               November 1999


   automated field fill-in function when it is finished filling in
   fields on a web page.  For this reason, it is recommended that the
   Ecom_SchemaVersion field be the last Ecom field on a web page.

   Merchant requests for information can extend over several
   interactions or web pages.  Without further provision, a facility
   could either require re-starting on each page or possibly violate or
   appear to violate privacy by continuing to fill in fields for pages
   beyond with end of the transaction with a particular merchant.  For
   this reason the Ecom_TransactionComplete field, which is normally
   hidden, is provided.  It is recommended that it appear on the last
   interaction or web page involved in a transaction, just before an
   Ecom_SchemaVersion field, so that multi-web-page automated field fill
   in logic could know when to stop if it chooses to check for this
   field.



3.3 Examples



3.3.1 HTML Example

   An example HTML form might be as follows:

   <HTML>
   <HEAD>
   <title> eCom Fields Example </title>
   </HEAD>
   <BODY>
    <FORM action="http://ecom.example.com" method="POST">
   Please enter card information:
   <p>Your name on the card
     <INPUT type="text" name="Ecom_Payment_Card_Name" SIZE=40>
   <br>The card number
     <INPUT type="text" name="Ecom_Payment_Card_Number" SIZE=19>
   <br>Expiration date (MM YY)
     <INPUT type="text" name="Ecom_Payment_Card_ExpDate_Month" SIZE=2>
     <INPUT type="text" name="Ecom_Payment_Card_ExpDate_Year" SIZE=4>
    <INPUT type="hidden" name="Ecom_Payment_Card_Protocol">
    <INPUT type="hidden" name="Ecom_SchemaVersion"
           value="http://www.ecml.org/version/1.1">
   <br>
    <INPUT type="submit" value="submit"> <INPUT type="reset">
    </FORM>
   </BODY>
   </HTML>

   After all of the pages are submitted, the merchant will reply with a

INTERNET-DRAFT              ECom Field Names               November 1999


   confirmation page informing both the user and the wallet that the
   transaction is complete.

   <HTML>
   <HEAD>
   <title> eCom Transaction Complete Example </title>
   </HEAD>
   <BODY>
    <FORM>
    Thank you for your order. It will be shipped in several days.
    <INPUT type="hidden" name="Ecom_TransactionComplete">
    <INPUT type="hidden" name="Ecom_SchemaVersion"
           value="http://www.ecml.org/version/1.1">
    </FORM>
   </BODY>
   </HTML>



3.3.2 XML Example

   A customer could return to a merchant the information asked for in
   section 3.3.1 above using XML as follows, assuming an XML based
   protocol was in place:

   <Ecom SchemaVersion ="http://www.ecml.org/version/1.1">
   <Payment>
   <Card Name="John Doe" Number="0987654321" Protocol="set iotp">
   <ExpDate Month="06" Year="2001" />
   </Card>
   </Payment>
   </Ecom>

4. Security and Privacy Considerations

   The information called for by many of these fields is sensitive and
   should be secured if being sent over the public Internet or through
   other channels where it can be observed.  Mechanisms for such
   protection are not specified herein but channel encryption such as
   SSL/TLS [RFC 2246] or IPSec [RFC 2411] would be appropriate in many
   cases.

   User control over release of such information is needed to protect
   the user's privacy.

   A wallet that is installed on a shared or public terminal should be
   configurable such that the ECML memory of address and other contact
   information is fully disabled.  This is vital to protect the privacy
   of library patrons, students, and customers using public terminals,
   and children who might, for example, use a form on a public terminal
   without realizing that their information is being stored.

   When contact information is stored, the operator should have an
   option to protect the information with a password, without which the
   information might be unavailable, even to someone who has access to
   the file(s) in which it is being stored.  This would also allow for a
   convenient method for multiple people to use their own ECML
   information from the same browser.

   Any multi-web-page or other multi-aggregate field fill in or data
   provision mechanism should check for the Ecom_TransactionComplete
   field and cease automated fill when it is encountered until fill is
   further authorized.
