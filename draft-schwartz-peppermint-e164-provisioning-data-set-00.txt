Abstract

   This document outlines which information should be captured when
   E.164 numbers are provisioned within a central registry.  This
   document is not a specification but rather a set of information
   which, when associated with an addressable entity can assist in
   applying policy to subsequent queries.

Internet-Draft         E.164 provisioning data set          January 2007


1.  Introduction

   When writing rule based engines to provide filtered access to E.164
   data it is often necessary to have more information available for the
   query than just the address of record (AOR) that corresponds to a
   particular number.  This additional required information is the
   subject of this draft document.  The data set in this document can -
   and should be - extended and is intended to spur discussion that will
   result in a complete set.


2.  Scope

   This document focuses on the supporting data set that is required to
   properly provisioning E.164 numbers.  A discussion of the mechanism
   to transfer or upload this data to the registry or the protocols used
   for this purpose is beyond the scope of this document.


3.  Provisioning Information

   The provisioning data can be broken down into two categories: static
   and dynamic.  Static information is that which is associated with the
   owner of the resource and remains constant from query to query.
   Dynamic information is that which can be factored into "profiles" or
   views of the data, each with potentially different data.

   o  Static Information

      The data in this category relates to the identification, ownership
      and general validity of the number.

      1.  Value

          The value is the resource that is being sought.  This value
          may be a fully qualified E.164 number (e.g. 12127775555), or
          alternatively, the value may be a number representing a range
          of numbers (e.g. 1212777).  In this latter case the "length"
          field defined below is needed to establish the limits of the
          number range.

      2.  Range

          This and the next field are used to assist in resolving ranges
          into individual and unique valid E.164 numbers.  The Range
          field is a Boolean value, which indicates whether the resource
          specified in the "Value" field is a range that needs to be
          expanded out to the "length" number of digits, or

          alternatively, an individual number that does not require
          further manipulation.

      3.  Length

          This field is used for expanding ranges to individual unique
          numbers.

      4.  CreationDateTime

          The value "CreationDateTime" refers to the date on which this
          resource was first provisioned by this service provider.  If
          the date does not match the current date and time this record
          contains modifications to an existing Value.  If the date does
          match the current date than this is a new record.

          +  TimeZone

             All DateTime fields must include TimeZone information for
             normalization.

      5.  Type

          There is value in knowing what type of resource this is (e.g.
          residential, call shop, etc).  Different types of resources
          have different usage patterns and capturing this information
          can assist in developing fraud detection engines

      6.  Privacy

          This field is a flag indicating whether this number is
          publicly available to anyone or whether there has to be a
          predetermined policy in place in order for the number to be
          given out

      7.  Ownership

          The Ownership field consists of additional subfields defining
          the ownership of the provisioned e164 resource.  At any given
          time there can be multiple "owners" of a given resource.  The
          three levels described in this document are Carrier of Record,
          Service Provider and End User.  Since it is quite possible
          that these are three distinct entities they all must be
          specified for the provisioned resource.  Since regulatory
          issues allow for ownership transfer to and from different
          ServiceProviders, each ServiceProvider field must be qualified
          via activation dates.

          +  CarrierOfRecord

             As defined in [2] the Carrier of Record is typically a
             service provider that is authorized to issue E.164 numbers
             for the provisioning of PSTN service under the authority of
             a National Regulatory Authority (NRA).

          +  ServiceProvider

             The ServiceProvider field indicates the party that "sells"
             the resource to the end user.  ServiceProvider field is
             subject to dates as defined below.

             -  ActivationDateTime

                There are many reasons why it is possible for a number
                to be provisioned but not yet active.  For example,
                consider the situation in which a service provider
                provisions a number range, but activates only the actual
                numbers that have been "sold" to customers.  The
                existance of an "ActivationDateTime" field would enable
                the service to activate only a single number or range of
                numbers at some future time.

             -  DeactivationDateTime

                Similar to the ActivationDateTime field described above,
                a DeactivationDateTime field could be used to port
                numbers to a different provider to comply with regional
                number portability requirements.

             -  TimeZone

                All DateTime fields must include TimeZone information
                for normalization.

          +  EndUser

             The EndUser field indicates the user to which this number
             was provisioned.  Note that there can be subfields
             associated with the EndUser that provide more information
             about this user.  Only one such field (EndUserTimeZone) is
             presented here as it is useful when creating user based
             policy engines.

             -  EndUserTimeZone

                Knowing the time zone of the user to which this number

                is provisioned can assist in developing receiving user
                time based policy

   o  Dynamic Information

      The data in this section belongs in a category that is dependent
      on "who is asking".  Some of the provisioned information in this
      section is querying party dependent while other information is
      queried data dependent.  Each set of "dynamic" information is
      grouped into a "profile" or "view" and there are potentially many
      profiles for each static resource record.  Specifically, there is
      always at least one profile for each static record representing
      the "default" behavior and 0 or more "specialized" profiles that
      override the default profile for requests that match the criteria
      of the profile.

      *  Profile

         +  QueryDataInformation

            1.  Validity

                The validity field is used to define a window in which
                this profile is active.  The following three subfields
                provide higher resolution for this field.

                o  StartDateTime

                o  StopDateTime

                o  TimeZone

            2.  AddressOfRecord

                The AOR field documents the actual location information
                for the associated resource.  The following two
                subcategories are provided for additional flexibility.

                o  Regex

                o  TerminationDomain

         +  QueryingPartyInformation

            1.  QueryFromLocation

                This includes both a user id as well as an IP/s from
                where the queries will emanate.

                o  QueryUserID

                o  QueryUserAddress

            2.  QueryMechanism

                Depending on the query mechanism used, it may be more
                advantageous to resolve to a different AOR.  For
                example, depending on which protocol is used, it might
                be possible to provide more extensive routing
                information.  Alternatively, the registry may choose to
                send different information back to the querying party
                depending on the security of the query communication
                path.  This subsection delineates these considerations.

                o  QueryType

                   There are many protocols that can be used to perform
                   the query.  While ENUM is one of the more popular
                   protocols there is no reason other protocols (e.g.
                   SIP 302) cannot be used as well.  Thus the Type of
                   Query field indicates which protocol will be used for
                   this profile.

                o  QuerySecurity

                   It is important to secure the location lookup process
                   especially if the lookup is remote.  This Security
                   field would include values such as "=IPSec"[1]


4.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security considerations.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document creates no new requirements on IANA namespaces
   [RFC2434].
