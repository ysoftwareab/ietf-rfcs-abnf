                  Maximum Allocation Model for DS-TE    September 2003 
 
  WHY IS IT TARGETED AT THIS WG(s)  
  TEWG is responsible for specifying protocol extensions for support of 
  Diff-Serv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering. 
   
  JUSTIFICATION  
  The TEWG charter states that "This will entail verification and 
  review of the Diffserv requirements in the WG Framework document and 
  initial specification of how these requirements can be met through 
  use and potentially expansion of existing protocols." 
  In line with this, the TEWG is specifying bandwidth constraints model 
  for Diff-Serv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering. This document specifies 
  one particular bandwidth constraints model. 
   
   
Specification of Requirements 
   
  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
  document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 
   
   
1.      Introduction 
 
  [DSTE-REQ] presents the Service Providers requirements for support of 
  Diff-Serv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering (DS-TE). This includes the 
  fundamental requirement to be able to enforce different bandwidth 
  constraints for different classes of traffic. 
   
  [DSTE-REQ] also defines the concept of Bandwidth Constraint Models 
  for DS-TE and states that "The DS-TE technical solution MUST specify 
  at least one bandwidth constraint model and MAY specify multiple 
  Bandwidth Constraints models." 
   
  This document provides a detailed description of one particular 
  Bandwidth Constraint model for DS-TE which is introduced in [DSTE-
  REQ] and called the Maximum Allocation Model (MAM). 
   
  [DSTE-PROTO] specifies the IGP and RSVP-TE signaling extensions for 
  support of DS-TE. These extensions support MAM. 
 
   
2.      Definitions 
   
  For readability a number of definitions from [DSTE-REQ] are repeated 
  here: 
   
  Class-Type (CT): the set of Traffic Trunks crossing a link that is 
  governed by a specific set of Bandwidth Constraints. CT is used for 
  the purposes of link bandwidth allocation, constraint based routing 
  and admission control. A given Traffic Trunk belongs to the same CT 
  on all links.

                  Maximum Allocation Model for DS-TE    September 2003 
 
  TE-Class: A pair of: 
             i. a Class-Type 
            ii. a preemption priority allowed for that Class-Type. This 
                means that an LSP transporting a Traffic Trunk from 
                that Class-Type can use that preemption priority as the 
                set-up priority, as the holding priority or both. 
   
   
  A number of recovery mechanisms under investigation or specification 
  in the IETF take advantage of the concept of bandwidth sharing across 
  particular sets of LSPs. "Shared Mesh Restoration" in [GMPLS-RECOV] 
  and "Facility-based Computation Model" in [MPLS-BACKUP] are example 
  mechanisms which increase bandwidth efficiency by sharing bandwidth 
  across backup LSPs protecting against independent failures. To ensure 
  that the notion of "Reserved (CTc)" introduced in [DSTE-REQ] is 
  compatible with such a concept of bandwidth sharing across multiple 
  LSPs, the wording of the "Reserved (CTc)" definition provided in 
  [DSTE-REQ] is generalized into the following:  
   
  Reserved (CTc): For a given Class-Type CTc ( 0 <= c <= MaxCT ) ,let 
  us define "Reserved(CTc)" as the total amount of the bandwidth 
  reserved by all the established LSPs which belong to CTc. 
   
  With this generalization, the Maximum Allocation Model definition 
  provided in this document is compatible with Shared Mesh Restoration 
  defined in [GMPLS-RECOV], so that DS-TE and Shared Mesh Protection 
  can operate simultaneously, under the assumption that Shared Mesh 
  Restoration operates independently within each DS-TE Class-Type and 
  does not operate across Class-Types (for example back up 
  LSPs protecting Primary LSPs of CTx must also belong to CTx; Excess 
  Traffic LSPs sharing bandwidth with Backup LSPs of CTx must also 
  belong to CTx). 
   
  We also introduce the following definition: 
   
  Reserved(CTb,q) : let us define "Reserved(CTb,q)" as the total amount 
  of the bandwidth reserved by all the established LSPs which belong to 
  CTb and have a holding priority of q. Note that if q and CTb do not 
  form one of the 8 possible configured TE-Classes, then there can not 
  be any established LSP which belong to CTb and have a holding 
  priority of q, so in that case, Reserved(CTb,q)=0. 
   
 
3.      Maximum Allocation Model Definition 
   
  MAM is defined in the following manner: 
        o Maximum Number of Bandwidth Constraints (MaxBC)=  
          Maximum Number of Class-Types (MaxCT) = 8 
        o for each value of c in the range 0 <= c <= (MaxCT - 1): 
            Reserved (CTc) <= BCc <= Max-Reservable-Bandwidth, 
        o SUM (Reserved(CTc)) <= Max-Reservable-Bandwidth 
             where the SUM is across all values of c in the range  
 
 Le Faucheur, Lai                                                    3 
 








 
                  Maximum Allocation Model for DS-TE    September 2003 
 
             0 <= c <= (MaxCT - 1) 
   
   
  A DS-TE LSR implementing MAM MUST support enforcement of bandwidth 
  constraints in compliance with this definition. 
   
   
  To increase the degree of bandwidth sharing among the different CTs, 
  the sum of bandwidth constraints may exceed the Maximum Reservable 
  Bandwidth, so that the following relationship may hold true: 
            o SUM (BCc) > Max-Reservable-Bandwidth, 
               where the SUM is across all values of c in the range  
               0 <= c <= (MaxCT - 1) 
   
  The sum of bandwidth constraints may also be equal to (or below) the 
  Maximum Reservable Bandwidth. In that case, the Maximum Reservable 
  Bandwidth does not actually constrain CT bandwidth reservations (in 
  other words, the 3rd bullet item of the MAM definition above will 
  never effectively come into play). This is because the 2nd bullet 
  item of the MAM definition above implies that: 
      SUM (reserved(CTc)) <= SUM (BCc)  
  and we assume here that  
      SUM (BCc) <= Maximum Reservable Bandwidth 
  therefore, it will always be true that: 
      SUM (Reserved(CTc)) <= Max-Reservable-Bandwidth. 
   
   
  Both preemption within a Class-Type and across Class-Types is 
  allowed. 
   
   
  Where 8 Class-Types are active, the MAM bandwidth constraints can 
  also be expressed in the following way: 
        - All LSPs from CT7 use no more than BC7 
        - All LSPs from CT6 use no more than BC6 
        - All LSPs from CT5 use no more than BC5 
        - etc. 
        - All LSPs from CT0 use no more than BC0 
        - All LSPs from all CTs collectively use no more than the 
          Maximum Reservable Bandwidth 
   
   
  Purely for illustration purposes, the diagram below represents MAM in 
  a pictorial manner when 3 Class-Types are active: 
   
        I----------------------------I 
        <---BC0--->                  I 
        I---------I                  I

        I----------------------------I 
   
        <--Max Reservable Bandwidth--> 
   
         
  (Note that, in this illustration, the sum BC0 + BC1 + BC2 exceeds the 
  Max Reservable Bandwidth.) 
   
   
  While more flexible/sophisticated Bandwidth Constraints models can be 
  defined (and are indeed defined - see [DSTE-RDM]), the Maximum 
  Allocation Model is attractive in some DS-TE environments for the 
  following reasons: 
       - Network administrators generally find MAM simple and 
          intuitive 
       - MAM matches simple bandwidth control policies that Network 
          Administrators may want to enforce such as setting individual 
          bandwidth constraint for a given type of traffic (aka. Class-
          Type) and simultaneously limit the aggregate of reserved 
          bandwidth across all types of traffic. 
       - MAM can be used in a way which ensures isolation across 
          Class-Types, whether preemption is used or not. 
       - MAM can simultaneously achieve isolation, bandwidth 
          efficiency and protection against QoS degradation of the 
          premium CT. 
       - MAM only requires limited protocol extensions such as the 
          ones defined in [DSTE-PROTO]. 
   
  MAM may not be attractive in some DS-TE environments because: 
       - MAM cannot simultaneously achieve isolation, bandwidth 
          efficiency and protection against QoS degradation of CTs 
          other than the Premium CT.

                  Maximum Allocation Model for DS-TE    September 2003 
 
  Additional considerations on the properties of MAM and its comparison 
  with RDM can be found in [BC-CONS] and [BC-MODEL]. 
   
   
  As a very simple example usage of the MAM Model, a network 
  administrator using one CT for Voice (CT1) and one CT for Data (CT0) 
  might configure on a given 2.5 Gb/s link: 
        - BC0 = 2 Gb/s (i.e. Data is limited to 2 Gb/s) 
        - BC1 = 1 Gb/s   (i.e. Voice is limited to 1 Gb/s) 
        - Maximum Reservable Bandwidth = 2.5 Gb/s (i.e. aggregate Data 
          + Voice is limited to 2.5 Gb/s) 
 
   
4.      Example Formulas for Computing "Unreserved TE-Class [i]" with 
   Maximum Allocation Model 
   
  As specified in [DSTE-PROTO], formulas for computing "Unreserved TE-
  Class [i]" MUST reflect all of the Bandwidth Constraints relevant to 
  the CT associated with TE-Class[i], and thus, depend on the Bandwidth 
  Constraints Model. Thus, a DS-TE LSR implementing MAM MUST reflect 
  the MAM bandwidth constraints defined in section 3 above when 
  computing "Unreserved TE-Class [i]". 
   
  Keeping in mind, as explained in [DSTE-PROTO], that details of 
  admission control algorithms as well as formulas for computing 
  "Unreserved TE-Class [i]" are outside the scope of the IETF work, we 
  provide in this section, for illustration purposes, an example of how 
  values for the unreserved bandwidth for TE-Class[i] might be computed 
  with MAM, assuming the basic admission control algorithm which simply 
  deducts the exact bandwidth of any established LSP from all of the 
  Bandwidth Constraints relevant to the CT associated with that LSP. 
   
  Then: 
   
     "Unreserved TE-Class [i]" = 
        
      MIN  [ 
     [ BCc - SUM ( Reserved(CTc,q) ) ] for q <= p  , 
     [ Max-Res-Bw - SUM (Reserved(CTb,q)) ] for q <= p and 0 <= b <= 7, 
            ] 
   
     where: 
          TE-Class [i] <--> < CTc , preemption p> 
          in the configured TE-Class mapping. 
   
   
5.      Security Considerations 
   
  Security considerations related to the use of DS-TE are discussed in 
  [DSTE-PROTO]. Those apply independently of the Bandwidth Constraints 
  model, including MAM specified in this document.

                  Maximum Allocation Model for DS-TE    September 2003 
 
Appendix A - Addressing [DSTE-REQ] Scenarios 
   
  This Appendix provides examples of how the Maximum Allocation 
  Bandwidth Constraints model can be used to support each of the 
  scenarios described in [DSTE-REQ]. 
   
1.      Scenario 1: Limiting Amount of Voice 
   
  By configuring on every link:  
        - Bandwidth Constraint 1 (for CT1=Voice) = "certain percentage" 
          of link capacity 
        - Bandwidth Constraint 0 (for CT0=Data) = link capacity (or a 
          constraint specific to data traffic) 
        - Max Reservable Bandwidth = link capacity 
   
  By configuring: 
        - every CT1/Voice TE-LSP with preemption =0  
        - every CT0/Data TE-LSP with preemption =1 
   
  DS-TE with the Maximum Allocation Model will address all the 
  requirements: 
        - amount of Voice traffic limited to desired percentage on 
          every link 
        - data traffic capable of using all remaining link capacity (or 
          up to its own specific constraint) 
        - voice traffic capable of preempting other traffic 
   
2.      Scenario 2: Maintain Relative Proportion of Traffic Classes 
   
  By configuring on every link:  
        - BC2 (for CT2) = e.g. 45% of link capacity 
        - BC1 (for CT1) = e.g. 35% of link capacity 
        - BC0 (for CT0) = e.g.100% of link capacity 
        - Max Reservable Bandwidth = link capacity 
   
  DS-TE with the Maximum Allocation Model will ensure that the amount 
  of traffic of each Class Type established on a link is within 
  acceptable levels as compared to the resources allocated to the 
  corresponding Diff-Serv PHBs regardless of which order the LSPs are 
  routed in, regardless of which preemption priorities are used by 
  which LSPs and regardless of failure situations. 
   
  By also configuring: 
        - every CT2/Voice TE-LSP with preemption =0  
        - every CT1/Premium Data TE-LSP with preemption =1  
        - every CT0/Best-Effort TE-LSP with preemption =2 
   
  DS-TE with the Maximum Allocation Model will also ensure that: 
        - CT2 Voice LSPs always have first preemption priority in order 
          to use the CT2 capacity 
        - CT1 Premium Data LSPs always have second preemption priority

                  Maximum Allocation Model for DS-TE    September 2003 
 
        - Best-Effort can use up to link capacity whatever is left by 
          CT2 and CT1.  
   
  Optional automatic adjustment of Diff-Serv scheduling configuration 
  could be used for maintaining very strict relationship between amount 
  of established traffic of each Class Type and corresponding Diff-Serv 
  resources. 
   
3.      Scenario 3: Guaranteed Bandwidth Services 
   
  By configuring on every link:  
        - BC1 (for CT1) = "given" percentage of link bandwidth 
          (appropriate to achieve the QoS objectives of the Guaranteed 
          Bandwidth service) 
        - BC0 (for CT0=Data) = link capacity (or a constraint specific 
          to data traffic) 
        - Max Reservable Bandwidth = link capacity 
   
  DS-TE with the Maximum Allocation Model will ensure that the amount 
  of Guaranteed Bandwidth Traffic established on every link remains 
  below the given percentage so that it will always meet its QoS 
  objectives. At the same time it will allow traffic engineering of the 
  rest of the traffic such that links can be filled up (or limited to 
  the specific constraint for such traffic).
