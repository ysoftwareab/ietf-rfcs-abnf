<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>This document specifies the requirements of an MPLS Transport Profile
      (MPLS-TP). This document is a product of a joint International
      Telecommunications Union (ITU)-IETF effort to include an MPLS Transport
      Profile within the IETF MPLS architecture to support the capabilities
      and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by
      International Telecommunications Union - Telecommunications

</p>
<p>This work is based on two sources of requirements; MPLS architecture
      as defined by IETF, and packet transport networks as defined by
      ITU-T.
</p>
<p>The requirements expressed in this document are for the behavior of
      the protocol mechanisms and procedures that constitute building blocks
      out of which the MPLS transport profile is constructed. The requirements
      are not implementation requirements.

Introduction</h3>

<p>For many years, transport networks (e.g. Synchronous Optical
      Networking (SONET)/Synchronous Digital hierarchy (SDH)) have provided
      carriers with a high benchmark for reliability and operational
      simplicity. With the accelerating growth and penetration of:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Packet-based services such as Ethernet, Voice over IP (VoIP),
          Layer 2 (L2)/Layer 3 (L3) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), IP
          Television (IPTV), Radio Access Network (RAN) backhauling, etc.
</li>
<li>Applications with various bandwidth and QoS requirements.
</li>
</ul><p>Carriers are in need of technologies capable of efficiently
      supporting packet-based services and applications on their transport
      networks. The need to increase their revenue while remaining competitive
      forces operators to look for the lowest network Total Cost of Ownership
      (TCO). Investment in equipment and facilities (Capital Expenditure
      (CAPEX)) and Operational Expenditure (OPEX) should be minimized.
</p>
<p>Carriers are considering migrating or evolving to packet transport
      networks in order to reduce their costs and to improve their ability to
      support services with guaranteed Service Level Agreements (SLAs). For
      carriers it is important that migrating from their existing transport
      networks to packet transport networks should not involve dramatic
      changes in network operation, should not necessitate extensive
      retraining, and should not require major changes to existing work
      practices. The aim is to preserve the look-and-feel to which carriers
      have become accustomed in deploying their transport networks, while
      providing common, multi-layer operations, resiliency, control and
      management for packet, circuit and lambda transport networks.
</p>
<p>Transport carriers require control and deterministic usage of network
      resources. They need end-to-end control to engineer network paths and to
      efficiently utilize network resources. They require capabilities to
      support static (Operations Support System (OSS) based) or dynamic
      (control plane) provisioning of deterministic, protected and secured
      services and their associated resources.
</p>
<p>Carriers will still need to cope with legacy networks (which are
      composed of many layers and technologies), thus the packet transport
      network should interwork as appropriate with other packet and transport
      networks (both horizontally and vertically). Vertical interworking is
      also known as client/server or network interworking. Horizontal
      interworking is also known as peer-partition or service interworking.
      For more details on each type of interworking and some of the issues
      that may arise (especially with horizontal interworking) see <a class='info' href='#ITU.Y1401.2008'>Y.1401<span> (</span><span class='info'>International Telecommunications             Union, &ldquo;Principles of interworking,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [ITU.Y1401.2008].
</p>
<p>MPLS is a maturing packet technology and it is already playing an
      important role in transport networks and services. However, not all of
      MPLS's capabilities and mechanisms are needed and/or consistent with
      transport network operations. There is therefore the need to define an
      MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) in order to support the capabilities
      and functionalities needed for packet transport network services and
      operations through combining the packet experience of MPLS with the
      operational experience of existing transport networks.
</p>
<p>MPLS-TP will enable the migration of transport networks to a
      packet-based network that will efficiently scale to support packet
      services in a simple and cost effective way. MPLS-TP needs to combine
      the necessary existing capabilities of MPLS with additional minimal
      mechanisms in order that it can be used in a transport role.
</p>
<p>This document specifies the requirements of an MPLS Transport Profile
      (MPLS-TP). The requirements are for the the behavior of the protocol
      mechanisms and procedures that constitute building blocks out of which
      the MPLS transport profile is constructed. That is, the requirements
      indicate what features are to be available in the MPLS toolkit for use
      by MPLS-TP. The requirements in this document do not describe what
      functions an MPLS-TP implementation supports. The purpose of this
      document is to identify the toolkit and any new protocol work that is
      required.
</p>
<p>Although this document is not a protocol specification, the key words
      "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
      NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are used as described in
      <a class='info' href='#RFC2119'>[RFC2119]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bradner, S., &ldquo;Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate           Requirement Levels,&rdquo; March&nbsp;1997.</span><span>)</span></a> and are to be interpreted as instructions
      to the protocol designers producing solutions that satisfy the
      requirements set out in this document.
</p>
<p>This document is a product of a joint ITU-IETF effort to include an
      MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS architecture to support the
      capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as
      defined by ITU-T.
</p>
<p>This work is based on two sources of requirements, MPLS architecture
      as defined by IETF and packet transport networks as defined by ITU-T.
      The requirements of MPLS-TP are provided below. The relevant functions
      of MPLS are included in MPLS-TP, except where explicitly excluded.
</p>
<p>Although both static and dynamic configuration of MPLS-TP transport
      paths (including Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) and
      protection capabilities) is required by this document, it MUST be
      possible for operators to be able to completely operate (including OAM
      and protection capabilities) an MPLS-TP network in the absence of any
      control plane protocols for dynamic configuration.

Terminology</h3>

<p>Note: Mapping between the terms in this section and ITU-T
        terminology will be described in a subsequent document.
</p>
<p>Note: The definition of segment in a GMPLS/ASON context (i.e. as
        defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC4397'>RFC4397<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bryskin, I. and A. Farrel, &ldquo;A Lexicography           for the Interpretation of Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching           (GMPLS) Terminology within the Context of the ITU-T's Automatically           Switched Optical Network (ASON) Architecture,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4397]) encompasses both
        segment and concatenated segment as defined in this document.
</p>
<p>Associated bidirectional path: A path that supports traffic flow in
        both directions but which is constructed from a pair of unidirectional
        paths (one for each direction) which are associated with one another
        at the path's ingress/egress points. The forward and backward
        directions may or may not follow the same route (links and nodes)
        across the network.
</p>
<p>Bidirectional path: A path where the forward and backward
        directions follow the same route (links and nodes) across the
        network.
</p>
<p>Concatenated Segment: A serial-compound link connection as defined
        in <a class='info' href='#ITU.G805.2000'>G.805<span> (</span><span class='info'>International Telecommunications             Union, &ldquo;Generic functional architecture of transport           networks,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a> [ITU.G805.2000]. A concatenated segment
        is a contiguous part of an LSP or multi-segment PW that comprises a
        set of segments and their interconnecting nodes in sequence.
</p>
<p>Co-routed bidirectional path: A bidirectional path where the
        forward and backward directions follow the same route (links and
        nodes) across its layer network.
</p>
<p>Domain: A domain represents a collection of entities (for example
        network elements) that are grouped for a particular purpose, examples
        of which are administrative and/or managerial responsibilities, trust
        relationships, addressing schemes, infrastructure capabilities,
        aggregation, survivability techniques, distributions of control
        functionality, etc. Examples of such domains include IGP areas and

<p>Layer network: Layer network is defined in <a class='info' href='#ITU.G805.2000'>G.805<span> (</span><span class='info'>International Telecommunications             Union, &ldquo;Generic functional architecture of transport           networks,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a> [ITU.G805.2000]. A layer network provides for the
        transfer of client information and independent operation of the client
        OAM. A Layer Network may be described in a service context as follows:
        one layer network may provide a (transport) service to higher client
        layer network and may, in turn, be a client to a lower layer network.
        A layer network is a logical construction somewhat independent of
        arrangement or composition of physical network elements. A particular
        physical network element may topologically belong to more than one
        layer network, depending on the actions it takes on the
        encapsulation(s) associated with the logical layers (e.g. the label
        stack), and thus could be modeled as multiple logical elements. A
        layer network may consist of zero or more sublayers. For additional
        explanation of how layer networks relate to the OSI concept of
        layering see Appendix I of <a class='info' href='#ITU.Y2611.2006'>Y.2611<span> (</span><span class='info'>International Telecommunications             Union, &ldquo;High-level architecture of future           packet-based networks,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> [ITU.Y2611.2006].
</p>
<p>Link: A physical or logical connection between a pair of LSRs that
        are adjacent at the (sub)layer network under consideration. A link may
        carry zero, one or more LSPs or PWs. A packet entering a link will
        emerge with the same label stack entry values.
</p>
<p>Logical Ring: An MPLS-TP logical ring is constructed from a set of
        LSRs and logical data links (such as MPLS-TP LSP tunnels or MSPL-TP
        pseudowires) and physical data links that form a ring topology.
</p>
<p>Path: See Transport path.
</p>
<p>Physical Ring: An MPLS-TP physical ring is constructed from a set
        of LSRs and physical data links that form a ring topology.
</p>
<p>Ring Topology: In an MPLS-TP ring topology each LSR is connected to
        exactly two other LSRs, each via a single point-to-point bidirectional
        MPLS-TP capable data link. A ring may also be constructed from only
        two LSRs where there are also exactly two links. Rings may be
        connected to other LSRs to form a larger network. Traffic originating
        or terminating outside the ring may be carried over the ring. Client
        network nodes (such as CEs) may be connected directly to an LSR in the
        ring.
</p>
<p>Section: A section is a server layer (which may be MPLS-TP or a
        different technology) which provides for encapsulation and OAM of a
        MPLS-TP transport path client layer. A section layer may provide for
        aggregation of multiple MPLS-TP clients. Note that <a class='info' href='#ITU.G805.2000'>G.805<span> (</span><span class='info'>International Telecommunications             Union, &ldquo;Generic functional architecture of transport           networks,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a> [ITU.G805.2000] defines the section layer as one
        of the two layer networks in a transmission media layer network. The
        other layer network is the physical media layer network.
</p>
<p>Segment: A link connection as defined in <a class='info' href='#ITU.G805.2000'>G.805<span> (</span><span class='info'>International Telecommunications             Union, &ldquo;Generic functional architecture of transport           networks,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a> [ITU.G805.2000]. A segment is the part of an LSP
        that traverses a single link or the part of a PW that traverses a
        single link (i.e. that connects a pair of adjacent {S|T}-PEs).
</p>
<p>Sublayer: Sublayer is defined in <a class='info' href='#ITU.G805.2000'>G.805<span> (</span><span class='info'>International Telecommunications             Union, &ldquo;Generic functional architecture of transport           networks,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a> [ITU.G805.2000]. The distinction between a layer
        network and a sublayer is that a sublayer is not directly accessible
        to clients outside of its encapsulating layer network and offers no
        direct transport service for a higher layer (client) network.
</p>
<p>Tandem Connection: A tandem connection is an arbitrary part of a
        transport path that can be monitored (via OAM) independently from the
        end-to-end monitoring (OAM). It may be a monitored segment, a
        monitored concatenated segment or any other monitored ordered sequence
        of contiguous hops and/or segments (and their interconnecting nodes)
        of a transport path.
</p>
<p>Transport path: A network connection as defined in <a class='info' href='#ITU.G805.2000'>G.805<span> (</span><span class='info'>International Telecommunications             Union, &ldquo;Generic functional architecture of transport           networks,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a> [ITU.G805.2000]. In an MPLS-TP environment a
        transport path corresponds to an LSP or a PW.
</p>
<p>Transport path layer: A layer network which provides point-to-point
        or point-to-multipoint transport paths which are used to carry a
        higher (client) layer network or aggregates of higher (client) layer
        networks, for example the transport service layer. It provides for
        independent OAM (of the client OAM) in the transport of the
        clients.
</p>
<p>Transport service layer: A layer network in which transport paths
        are used to carry a customer&rsquo;s (individual or bundled) service
        (may be point-to-point, point-to-multipoint or
        multipoint-to-multipoint services).
</p>
<p>Transmission media layer: A layer network which provides sections
        (two-port point-to-point connections) to carry the aggregate of
        network transport path or network service layers on various physical
        media.
</p>
<p>Unidirectional path: A path that supports traffic flow in only one
        direction.

Transport network overview</h3>

<p>The connection (or transport path) service is the basic service
        provided by a transport network. The purpose of a transport network is
        to carry its clients (i.e. the stream of client PDUs or client bits)
        between endpoints in the network (typically over several intermediate
        nodes). These endpoints may be service switching points or service
        terminating points. The connection services offered to customers are
        aggregated into large transport paths with long-holding times and
        independent OAM (of the client OAM), which contribute to enabling the
        efficient and reliable operation of the transport network. These
        transport paths are modified infrequently.
</p>
<p>Aggregation and hierarchy are beneficial for achieving scalability
        and security since: </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>They reduce the number of provisioning and forwarding states in
            the network core.
</li>
<li>They reduce load and the cost of implementing service assurance
            and fault management.
</li>
<li>Clients are encapsulated and layer associated OAM overhead is
            added. This allows complete isolation of customer traffic and its
            management from carrier operations.
</li>
</ol>

<p>An important attribute of a transport network is that it is able to
        function regardless of which clients are using its connection service
        or over which transmission media it is running. The client, transport
        network and server layers are from a functional and operations point
        of view independent layer networks. Another key characteristic of
        transport networks is the capability to maintain the integrity of the
        client across the transport network. A transport network must provide
        the means to commit quality of service objectives to clients. This is
        achieved by providing a mechanism for client network service
        demarcation for the network path together with an associated network
        resiliency mechanism. A transport network must also provide a method
        of service monitoring in order to verify the delivery of an agreed
        quality of service. This is enabled by means of carrier-grade OAM
        tools.
</p>
<p>Clients are first encapsulated. These encapsulated client signals
        may then be aggregated into a connection for transport through the
        network in order to optimize network management. Server layer OAM is
        used to monitor the transport integrity of the client layer or client
        aggregate. At any hop, the aggregated signals may be further
        aggregated in lower layer transport network paths for transport across
        intermediate shared links. The encapsulated client signals are
        extracted at the edges of aggregation domains, and are either
        delivered to the client or forwarded to another domain. In the core of
        the network, only the server layer aggregated signals are monitored;
        individual client signals are monitored at the network boundary in the
        client layer network. Although the connectivity of the client of the
        transport path layer may be point-to-point, point-to-multipoint or
        multipoint-to-multipoint, the transport path layer itself only
        provides point-to-point or point-to-multipoint transport paths which
        are used to carry the client.
</p>
<p>Quality-of-service mechanisms are required in the packet transport
        network to ensure the prioritization of critical services, to
        guarantee BW and to control jitter and delay.

<a name="rfc.section.1.3"></a><h3>1.3.&nbsp;
Layer network overview</h3>

<p>A layer network provides its clients with a transport service and
        the operation of the layer network is independent of whatever client
        happens to use the layer network. Information that passes between any
        client to the layer network is common to all clients and is the
        minimum needed to be consistent with the definition of the transport
        service offered. The client layer network can be connectionless,
        connection oriented packet switched, or circuit switched. The
        transport service transfers a payload (individual packet payload for
        connectionless networks, a sequence of packets payloads in the case of
        connection oriented packet switched networks, and a deterministic
        schedule of payloads in the case of circuit switched networks) such
        that the client can populate the payload without affecting any
        operation within the serving layer network.
</p>
<p>The operations within a layer network that are independent of the
        clients include the control of forwarding, the control of resource
        reservation, the control of traffic demerging, and the OAM of the
        transport service. All of these operations are internal to a layer
        network. By definition, a layer network does not rely on any client
        information to perform these operations and therefore all information
        required to perform these operations is independent of whatever client
        is using the layer network.
</p>
<p>A layer network will have common features in order to support the
        control of forwarding, resource reservation, and OAM. For example, a
        layer network will have a common addressing scheme for the end points
        of the transport service and a common set of transport descriptors for
        the transport service. However, a client may use a different
        addressing scheme or different traffic descriptors (consistent with
        performance inheritance).
</p>
<p>It is sometimes useful to independently monitor a smaller domain
        within a layer network (or the transport services as the traverse this
        smaller domain) but the control of forwarding or the control of
        resource reservation involved retain their common elements. These
        smaller monitored domains are sublayers.
</p>
<p>It is sometimes useful to independently control forwarding within
        smaller domain within a layer network but the control of resource
        reservation and OAM retain their common elements. These smaller
        domains are partitions of the layer network.

Ring protection</h3>

<p>Several service providers have expressed a high level of
            interest in operating MPLS-TP in ring topologies and require a
            high level of survivability function in these topologies. The
            requirements listed below have been collected from these service
            providers and from the ITU-T.
</p>
<p>The main objective in considering a specific topology (such as
            a ring) is to determine whether it is possible to optimize any
            mechanisms such that the performance of those mechanisms within
            the topology is significantly better than the performance of the
            generic mechanisms in the same topology. The benefits of such
            optimizations are traded against the costs of developing,
            implementing, deploying, and operating the additional optimized
            mechanisms noting that the generic mechanisms MUST continue to be
            supported.
</p>
<p>Within the context of recovery in MPLS-TP networks, the
            optimization criteria considered in ring topologies are as
            follows: </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>a.</dt>
<dd>Minimize the number of OAM MEs that are needed to trigger
                the recovery operation &ndash; less than are required by other
                recovery mechanisms.
</dd>
<dt>b.</dt>
<dd>Minimize the number of elements of recovery in the ring
                &ndash; less than are required by other recovery
                mechanisms.
</dd>
<dt>c.</dt>
<dd>Minimize the number of labels required for the protection
                paths across the ring &ndash; less than are required by other
                recovery mechanisms.
</dd>
<dt>d.</dt>
<dd>Minimize the amount of management plane transactions during
                a maintenance operation (e.g., ring upgrade) &ndash; less than
                are required by other recovery mechanisms.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>It may be observed that the requirements in this section are
            fully compatible with the generic requirements expressed above,
            and that no requirements that are specific to ring topologies have
            been identified.
</p>
