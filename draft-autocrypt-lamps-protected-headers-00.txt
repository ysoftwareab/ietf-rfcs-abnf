               Protected Headers for Cryptographic E-mail
               draft-autocrypt-lamps-protected-headers-00

Abstract

   This document describes a common strategy to extend the end-to-end
   cryptographic protections provided by PGP/MIME, etc. to protect
   message headers in addition to message bodies.  In addition to
   protecting the authenticity and integrity of headers via signatures,
   it also describes how to preserve the confidentiality of the Subject
   header.

1.  Introduction

   E-mail end-to-end security with OpenPGP and S/MIME standards can
   provide integrity, authentication, non-repudiation and
   confidentiality to the body of a MIME e-mail message.  However, PGP/
   MIME ([RFC3156]) alone does not protect message headers.  And the
   structure to protect headers defined in S/MIME 3.1 ([RFC3851]) has
   not seen widespread adoption.

   This document defines a scheme, "Protected Headers for Cryptographic
   E-mail", which has been adopted by multiple existing e-mail clients
   in order to extend the cryptographic protections provided by PGP/MIME
   to also protect the message headers.

Internet-Draft Protected Headers for Cryptographic E-mail  November 2019


   This document describes how these protections can be applied to
   cryptographically signed messages, and also discusses some of the
   challenges of encrypting many transit-oriented headers.

   It offers guidance for protecting the confidentiality of non-transit-
   oriented headers like Subject, and also offers a means to preserve
   backwards compatibility so that an encrypted Subject remains
   available to recipients using software that does not implement
   support for the Protected Headers scheme.

   The document also discusses some of the compatibility constraints and
   usability concerns which motivated the design of the scheme, as well
   as limitations and a comparison with other proposals.

   While the document (and the authors') focus is primarily PGP/MIME, we
   believe the technique is broadly applicable and would also apply to
   other MIME-compatible cryptographic e-mail systems, including S/MIME
   ([RFC8551]).  Furthermore, this technique has already proven itself
   as a useful building block for other improvements to cryptographic
   e-mail, such as the Autocrypt Level 1.1 ([Autocrypt]) "Gossip"
   mechanism.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Terminology

   For the purposes of this document, we define the following concepts:

   *  _MUA_ is short for Mail User Agent; an e-mail client.

   *  _Protection_ of message data refers to cryptographic encryption
      and/or signatures, providing confidentiality, authenticity or
      both.

   *  _Cryptographic Layer_, _Cryptographic Envelope_ and _Cryptographic
      Payload_ are defined in Section 3

   *  _Original Headers_ are the [RFC2822] message headers as known to
      the sending MUA at the time of message composition.

   *  _Protected Headers_ are any headers protected by the scheme
      described in this document.

Internet-Draft Protected Headers for Cryptographic E-mail  November 2019


   *  _Exposed Headers_ are any headers outside the Cryptographic
      Payload (protected or not).

   *  _Obscured Headers_ are any Protected Headers which have been
      modified or removed from the set of Exposed Headers.

   *  _Legacy Display Part_ is a MIME construct which provides
      visibility for users of legacy clients of data from the Original
      Headers which may have been removed or obscured from the Exposed
      Headers.  It is defined in Section 5.

   *  _User-Facing Headers_ are explained and enumerated in
      Section 1.2.1.

   *  _Structural Headers_ are documented in Section 1.2.2.

1.2.1.  User-Facing Headers

   Of all the headers that an e-mail message may contain, only a handful
   are typically presented directly to the user.  The user-facing
   headers are:

   *  "Subject"

   *  "From"

   *  "To"

   *  "Cc"

   *  "Date"

   *  "Reply-To"

   *  "Followup-To"

   The above is a complete list.  No other headers are considered "user-
   facing".

   Other headers may affect the visible rendering of the message (e.g.,
   "References" and "In-Reply-To" may affect the placement of a message
   in a threaded discussion), but they are not directly displayed to the
   user and so are not considered "user-facing" for the purposes of this
   document.

Internet-Draft Protected Headers for Cryptographic E-mail  November 2019


1.2.2.  Structural Headers

   A message header whose name begins with "Content-" is referred to in
   this document as a "structural" header.

   These headers indicate something about the specific MIME part they
   are attached to, and cannot be transferred or copied to other parts
   without endangering the readability of the message.

   This includes (but is not limited to):

   *  "Content-Type"

   *  "Content-Transfer-Encoding"

   *  "Content-Disposition"

   Note that no "user-facing" headers (Section 1.2.1) are also
   "structural" headers.  Of course, many headers are neither "user-
   facing" nor "structural".

   FIXME: are there any non-"Content-*" headers we should consider as
   structural?

2.  Protected Headers Summary

   The Protected Headers scheme relies on three backward-compatible
   changes to a cryptographically-protected e-mail message:

   *  Headers known to the composing MUA at message composition time are
      (in addition to their typical placement as Exposed Headers on the
      outside of the message) also present in the MIME header of the
      root of the Cryptographic Payload.  These Protected Headers share
      cryptographic properties with the rest of the Cryptographic
      Payload.

   *  When the Cryptographic Envelope includes encryption, any Exposed
      Header MAY be _obscured_ by a transformation (including deletion).

   *  If the composing MUA intends to obscure any user-facing headers,
      it MAY add a decorative "Legacy Display" MIME part to the
      Cryptographic Payload which additionally duplicates the original
      values of the obscured user-facing headers.

   When a composing MUA encrypts a message, it SHOULD obscure the
   "Subject:" header, by using the literal string "..." (three U+002E
   FULL STOP characters) as the value of the exposed "Subject:" header.

Internet-Draft Protected Headers for Cryptographic E-mail  November 2019


   When a receiving MUA encounters a message with a Cryptographic
   Envelope, it treats the headers of the Cryptographic Payload as
   belonging to the message itself, not just the subpart.  In
   particular, when rendering a header for any such message, the
   renderer SHOULD prefer the header's Protected value over its Exposed
   value.

   A receiving MUA that understands Protected Headers and discovers a
   Legacy Display part SHOULD hide the Legacy Display part when
   rendering the message.

   The following sections contain more detailed discussion.

3.  Cryptographic MIME Message Structure

   Implementations use the structure of an e-mail message to protect the
   headers.  This section establishes some conventions about how to
   think about message structure.

3.1.  Cryptographic Layers

   "Cryptographic Layer" refers to a MIME substructure that supplies
   some cryptographic protections to an internal MIME subtree.  The
   internal subtree is known as the "protected part" though of course it
   may itself be a multipart object.

   For PGP/MIME [RFC3156] there are two forms of Cryptographic Layers,
   signing and encryption.

   In the diagrams below, "↧" (DOWNWARDS ARROW FROM BAR, U+21A7) is used
   to indicate "decrypts to".

3.1.1.  PGP/MIME Signing Cryptographic Layer (multipart/signed)

   └┬╴multipart/signed
    ├─╴[protected part]
    └─╴application/pgp-signature

3.1.2.  PGP/MIME Encryption Cryptographic Layer (multipart/encrypted)

   └┬╴multipart/encrypted
    ├─╴application/pgp-encrypted
    └─╴application/octet-stream
     ↧ (decrypts to)
     └─╴[protected part]

Internet-Draft Protected Headers for Cryptographic E-mail  November 2019


3.2.  Cryptographic Envelope

   The Cryptographic Envelope is the largest contiguous set of
   Cryptographic Layers of an e-mail message starting with the outermost
   MIME type (that is, with the Content-Type of the message itself).

   If the Content-Type of the message itself is not a Cryptographic
   Layer, then the message has no cryptographic envelope.

   "Contiguous" in the definition above indicates that if a
   Cryptographic Layer is the protected part of another Cryptographic
   Layer, the layers together comprise a single Cryptographic Envelope.

   Note that if a non-Cryptographic Layer intervenes, all Cryptographic
   Layers within the non-Cryptographic Layer _are not_ part of the
   Cryptographic Envelope (see the example in Section 3.3.3).

   Note also that the ordering of the Cryptographic Layers implies
   different cryptographic properties.  A signed-then-encrypted message
   is different than an encrypted-then-signed message.

3.3.  Cryptographic Payload

   The Cryptographic Payload of a message is the first non-Cryptographic
   Layer - the "protected part" - within the Cryptographic Envelope.
   Since the Cryptographic Payload itself is a MIME part, it has its own
   set of headers.

   Protected headers are placed on (and read from) the Cryptographic
   Payload, and should be considered to have the same cryptographic
   properties as the message itself.

3.3.1.  Simple Cryptographic Payloads

   As described above, if the "protected part" identified in
   Section 3.1.1 or Section 3.1.2 is not itself a Cryptographic Layer,
   that part _is_ the Cryptographic Payload.

   If the application wants to generate a message that is both encrypted
   and signed, it MAY use the simple MIME structure from Section 3.1.2
   by ensuring that the [RFC4880] Encrypted Message within the
   "application/octet-stream" part contains an [RFC4880] Signed Message.

3.3.2.  Multilayer Cryptographic Envelopes

   It is possible to construct a Cryptographic Envelope consisting of
   multiple layers for PGP/MIME, typically of the following structure:




Einarsson, et al.          Expires 7 May 2020                   [Page 8]

Internet-Draft Protected Headers for Cryptographic E-mail  November 2019


   A └┬╴multipart/encrypted
   B  ├─╴application/pgp-encrypted
   C  └─╴application/octet-stream
   D   ↧ (decrypts to)
   E   └┬╴multipart/signed
   F    ├─╴[Cryptographic Payload]
   G    └─╴application/pgp-signature

   When handling such a message, the properties of the Cryptographic
   Envelope are derived from the series "A", "E".

   As noted in Section 3.3.1, PGP/MIME applications also have a simpler
   MIME construction available with the same cryptographic properties.

3.3.3.  A Baroque Example

   Consider a message with the following overcomplicated structure:

   H └┬╴multipart/encrypted
   I  ├─╴application/pgp-encrypted
   J  └─╴application/octet-stream
   K   ↧ (decrypts to)
   L   └┬╴multipart/signed
   M    ├┬╴multipart/mixed
   N    │├┬╴multipart/signed
   O    ││├─╴text/plain
   P    ││└─╴application/pgp-signature
   Q    │└─╴text/plain
   R    └─╴application/pgp-signature

   The 3 Cryptographic Layers in such a message are rooted in parts "H",
   "L", and "N".  But the Cryptographic Envelope of the message consists
   only of the properties derived from the series "H", "L".  The
   Cryptographic Payload of the message is part "M".

   It is NOT RECOMMENDED to generate messages with such complicated
   structures.  Even if a receiving MUA can parse this structure
   properly, it is nearly impossible to render in a way that the user
   can reason about the cryptographic properties of part "O" compared to
   part "Q".

3.4.  Exposed Headers are Outside

   The Cryptographic Envelope fully encloses the Cryptographic Payload,
   whether the message is signed or encrypted or both.  The Exposed
   Headers are considered to be outside of both.

4.  Message Composition

   This section describes the composition of a cryptographically-
   protected message with Protected Headers.

   We document legacy composition of cryptographically-protected
   messages (without protected headers) in Section 4.4, and then
   describe a revised version of that algorithm in Section 4.5 that
   produces conformant Protected Headers.

4.1.  Copying All Headers

   All non-structural headers known to the composing MUA are copied to
   the MIME header of the Cryptographic Payload.  The composing MUA
   SHOULD protect all known non-structural headers in this way.

   If the composing MUA omits protection for some of the headers, the
   receiving MUA will have difficulty reasoning about the integrity of
   the headers (see Section 11.2).

4.2.  Confidential Subject

   When a message is encrypted, the Subject should be obscured by
   replacing the Exposed Subject with three periods: "..."

   This value ("...") was chosen because it is believed to be language
   agnostic and avoids communicating any potentially misleading
   information to the recipient (see Section 7.1 for a more detailed
   discussion).

4.3.  Obscured Headers

   Due to compatibility and usability concerns, a Mail User Agent SHOULD
   NOT obscure any of: "From", "To", "Cc", "Message-ID", "References",
   "Reply-To", "In-Reply-To", (FIXME: MORE?) unless the user has
   indicated they have security constraints which justify the potential
   downsides (see Section 7 for a more detailed discussion).

   Aside from that limitation, this specification does not at this time
   define or limit the methods a MUA may use to convert Exposed Headers
   into Obscured Headers.

4.4.  Message Composition without Protected Headers

   This section roughly describes the steps that a legacy MUA might use
   to compose a cryptographically-protected message _without_ Protected
   Headers.

      formed MIME tree (possibly just a single MIME leaf part).  As a
      well-formed MIME tree, "origbody" already has structural headers
      present (see Section 1.2.2).

   *  "origheaders": the intended non-structural headers for the
      message, represented here as a table mapping from header names to
      header values.. For example, "origheaders['From']" refers to the
      value of the "From" header that the composing MUA would typically
      place on the message before sending it.

   *  "crypto": The series of cryptographic protections to apply (for
      example, "sign with the secret key corresponding to OpenPGP
      certificate X, then encrypt to OpenPGP certificates X and Y").
      This is a routine that accepts a MIME tree as input (the
      Cryptographic Payload), wraps the input in the appropriate
      Cryptographic Envelope, and returns the resultant MIME tree as
      output,

   The algorithm returns a MIME object that is ready to be injected into
   the mail system:

   *  Apply "crypto" to "origbody", yielding MIME tree "output"

   *  For header name "h" in "origheaders":

      -  Set header "h" of "output" to "origheaders[h]"

   *  Return "output"

4.5.  Message Composition with Protected Headers

   A reasonable sequential algorithm for composing a message _with_
   protected headers takes two more parameters in addition to
   "origbody", "origheaders", and "crypto":

   *  "obscures": a table of headers to be obscured during encryption,
      mapping header names to their obscuring values.  For example, this
      document recommends only obscuring the subject, so that would be
      represented by the single-entry table "obscures = {'Subject':
      '...'}".  If header "Foo" is to be deleted entirely,
      "obscures['Foo']" should be set to the special value "null".

   *  "legacy": a boolean value, indicating whether any recipient of the
      message is believed to have a legacy client (that is, a MUA that




Einarsson, et al.          Expires 7 May 2020                  [Page 11]

Internet-Draft Protected Headers for Cryptographic E-mail  November 2019


      is capable of decryption, but does not understand protected
      headers).

   The revised algorithm for applying cryptographic protection to a
   message is as follows:

   *  if "crypto" contains encryption, and "legacy" is "true", and
      "obscures" contains any user-facing headers (see Section 1.2.1),
      wrap "orig" in a structure that carries a Legacy Display part:

      -  Create a new MIME leaf part "legacydisplay" with header
         "Content-Type: text/rfc822-headers; protected-headers="v1""

      -  For each obscured header name "obh" in "obscures":

         o  If "obh" is user-facing:

            +  Add "obh: origheaders[ob]" to the body of
               "legacydisplay".  For example, if
               "origheaders['Subject']" is "lunch plans?", then add the
               line "Subject: lunch plans?" to the body of
               "legacydisplay"

      -  Construct a new MIME part "wrapper" with "Content-Type:
         multipart/mixed"

      -  Give "wrapper" exactly two subarts: "legacydisplay" and
         "origbody", in that order.

      -  Let "payload" be MIME part "wrapper"

   *  Otherwise:

      -  Let "payload" be MIME part "origbody"

   *  For each header name "h" in "origheaders":

      -  Set header "h" of MIME part "payload" to "origheaders[h]"

   *  FIXME: Enigmail adds "protected-headers="v1"" parameter to
      "payload" here.  Is this necessary?

   *  Apply "crypto" to "payload", producing MIME tree "output"

   *  If "crypto" contains encryption:

      -  For each obscured header name "obh" in "obscures":




Einarsson, et al.          Expires 7 May 2020                  [Page 12]

Internet-Draft Protected Headers for Cryptographic E-mail  November 2019


         o  If "obscures[obh]" is "null":

            +  Drop "obh" from "origheaders"

         o  Else:

            +  Set "origheaders[obh]" to "obscures[obh]"

   *  For each header name "h" in "origheaders":

      -  Set header "h" of "output" to "origheaders[h]"

   *  return "output"

   Note that both new parameters, "obscured" and "legacy", are
   effectively ignored if "crypto" does not contain encryption.  This is
   by design, because they are irrelevant for signed-only cryptographic
   protections.

5.  Legacy Display

   MUAs typically display user-facing headers (Section 1.2.1) directly
   to the user.  An encrypted message may be read by a decryption-
   capable legacy MUA that is unaware of this standard.  The user of
   such a legacy client risks losing access to any obscured headers.

   This section presents a workaround to mitigate this risk by
   restructuring the Cryptographic Payload before encrypting to include
   a "Legacy Display" part.

5.1.  Message Generation: Including a Legacy Display Part

   A generating MUA that wants to make an Obscured Subject (or any other
   user-facing header) visible to a recipient using a legacy MUA SHOULD
   modify the Cryptographic Payload by wrapping the intended body of the
   message in a "multipart/mixed" MIME part that prefixes the intended
   body with a Legacy Display part.

   The Legacy Display part MUST be of Content-Type "text/
   rfc822-headers", and MUST contain a "protected-headers" parameter
   whose value is "v1".  It SHOULD be marked with "Content-Disposition:
   inline" to encourage recipients to render it.

   The contents of the Legacy Display part MUST be only the user-facing
   headers that the sending MUA intends to obscure after encryption.

   The original body (now a subpart) SHOULD also be marked with




Einarsson, et al.          Expires 7 May 2020                  [Page 13]

Internet-Draft Protected Headers for Cryptographic E-mail  November 2019


   "Content-Disposition: inline" to discourage legacy clients from
   presenting it as an attachment.

5.1.1.  Legacy Display Transformation

   Consider a message whose Cryptographic Payload, before encrypting,
   that would have a traditional "multipart/alternative" structure:

   X └┬╴multipart/alternative
   Y  ├─╴text/plain
   Z  └─╴text/html

   When adding a Legacy Display part, this structure becomes:

   V └┬╴multipart/mixed
   W  ├─╴text/rfc822-headers ("Legacy Display" part)
   X  └┬╴multipart/alternative ("original body")
   Y   ├─╴text/plain
   Z   └─╴text/html

   Note that with the inclusion of the Legacy Display part, the
   Cryptographic Payload is the "multipart/mixed" part (part "V" in the
   example above), so Protected Headers should be placed at that part.

5.1.2.  When to Generate Legacy Display

   A MUA SHOULD transform a Cryptographic Payload to include a Legacy
   Display part only when:

   *  The message is going to be encrypted, and

   *  At least one user-facing header (see Section 1.2.1) is going to be
      obscured

   Additionally, if the sender knows that the recipient's MUA is capable
   of interpreting Protected Headers, it SHOULD NOT attempt to include a
   Legacy Display part.  (Signalling such a capability is out of scope
   for this document)

5.2.  Message Rendering: Omitting a Legacy Display Part

   A MUA that understands Protected Headers may receive an encrypted
   message that contains a Legacy Display part.  Such an MUA SHOULD
   avoid rendering the Legacy Display part to the user at all, since it
   is aware of and can render the actual Protected Headers.

   If a Legacy Display part is detected, the Protected Headers should
   still be pulled from the Cryptographic Payload (part "V" in the



Einarsson, et al.          Expires 7 May 2020                  [Page 14]

Internet-Draft Protected Headers for Cryptographic E-mail  November 2019


   example above), but the body of message SHOULD be rendered as though
   it were only the original body (part "X" in the example above).

5.2.1.  Legacy Display Detection Algorithm

   A receiving MUA acting on a message SHOULD detect the presence of a
   Legacy Display part and the corresponding "original body" with the
   following simple algorithm:

   *  Check that all of the following are true for the message:

   *  The Cryptographic Envelope must contain an encrypting
      Cryptographic Layer

   *  The Cryptographic Payload must have a "Content-Type" of
      "multipart/mixed"

   *  The Cryptographic Payload must have exactly two subparts

   *  The first subpart of the Cryptographic Payload must have a
      "Content-Type" of "text/rfc822-headers"

   *  The first subpart of the Cryptographic Payload's "Content-Type"
      must contain a property of "protected-headers", and its value must
      be "v1".

   *  If all of the above are true, then the first subpart is the Legacy
      Display part, and the second subpart is the "original body".
      Otherwise, the message does not have a Legacy Display part.

5.3.  Legacy Display is Decorative and Transitional

   As the above makes clear, the Legacy Display part is strictly
   decorative, for the benefit of legacy decryption-capable MUAs that
   may handle the message.  As such, the existence of the Legacy Display
   part and its "multipart/mixed" wrapper are part of a transition plan.

   As the number of decryption-capable clients that understand Protected
   Headers grows in comparison to the number of legacy decryption-
   capable clients, it is expected that some senders will decide to stop
   generating Legacy Display parts entirely.

   A MUA developer concerned about accessiblity of the Subject header
   for their users of encrypted mail when Legacy Display parts are
   omitted SHOULD implement the Protected Headers scheme described in
   this document.

6.  Message Interpretation

   This document does not currently provide comprehensive
   recommendations on how to interpret Protected Headers.  This is
   deliberate; research and development is still ongoing.  We also
   recognize that the tolerance of different user groups for false
   positives (benign conditions misidentified as security risks), vs.
   their need for strong protections varies a great deal and different
   MUAs will take different approaches as a result.

   Some common approaches are discussed below.

6.1.  Reverse-Copying

   One strategy for interpreting Protected Headers on an incoming
   message is to simply ignore any Exposed Header for which a Protected
   counterpart is available.  This is often implemented as a copy
   operation (copying header back out of the Cryptographic Payload into
   the main message header) within the code which takes care of parsing
   the message.

   A MUA implementing this strategy should pay special attention to any
   user facing headers (Section 1.2.1).  If a message has Protected
   Headers, and a user-facing header is among the Exposed Headers but
   missing from the Protected Headers, then an MUA implementing this
   strategy SHOULD delete the identified Exposed Header before
   presenting the message to the user.

   This strategy does not risk raising a false alarm about harmless
   deviations, but conversely it does nothing to inform the user if they
   are under attack.  This strategy does successfully mitigate and
   thwart some attacks, including signature replay attacks
   (Section 11.2) and participant modification attacks (Section 11.3).

6.2.  Signature Invalidation

   An alternate strategy for interpreting Protected Headers is to
   consider the cryptographic signature on a message to be invalid if
   the Exposed Headers deviate from their Protected counterparts.

   This state should be presented to the user using the same interface
   as other signature verification failures.

   A MUA implementing this strategy MAY want to make a special exception
   for the "Subject:" header, to avoid invalidating the signature on any
   signed and encrypted message with a confidential subject.





Einarsson, et al.          Expires 7 May 2020                  [Page 16]

Internet-Draft Protected Headers for Cryptographic E-mail  November 2019


   Note that simple signature invalidation may be insufficient to defend
   against a participant modification attack (Section 11.3).

6.3.  The Legacy Display Part

   This part is purely decorative, for the benefit of any recipient
   using a legacy decryption-capable MUA.  See Section 5.2 for details
   and recommendations on how to handle the Legacy Display part.

6.4.  Replying to a Message with Obscured Headers

   When replying to a message, many MUAs copy headers from the original
   message into their reply.

   When replying to an encrypted message, users expect the replying MUA
   to generate an encrypted message if possible.  If encryption is not
   possible, and the reply will be cleartext, users typically want the
   MUA to avoid leaking previously-encrypted content into the cleartext
   of the reply.

   For this reason, an MUA replying to an encrypted message with
   Obscured Headers SHOULD NOT leak the cleartext of any Obscured
   Headers into the cleartext of the reply, whether encrypted or not.

   In particular, the contents of any Obscured Protected Header from the
   original message SHOULD NOT be placed in the Exposed Headers of the
   reply message.

7.  Common Pitfalls and Guidelines

   Among the MUA authors who already implemented most of this
   specification, several alternative or more encompasing specifications
   were discussed and sometimes tried out in practice.  This section
   highlights a few "pitfalls" and guidelines based on these discussions
   and lessons learned.

7.1.  Misunderstood Obscured Subjects

   There were many discussions around what text phrase to use to obscure
   the "Subject:".  Text phrases such as "Encrypted Message" were tried
   but resulted in both localization problems and user confusion.

   If the natural language phrase for the obscured "Subject:" is not
   localized (e.g. just English "Encrypted Message"), then it may be
   incomprehensible to a non-English-speaking recipient who uses a
   legacy MUA that renders the obscured "Subject:" directly.





Einarsson, et al.          Expires 7 May 2020                  [Page 17]

Internet-Draft Protected Headers for Cryptographic E-mail  November 2019


   On the other hand, if it is localized based on the sender's MUA
   language settings, there is no guarantee that the recipient prefers
   the same language as the sender (consider a German speaker sending
   English text to an Anglophone).  There is no standard way for a
   sending MUA to infer the language preferred by the recipient (aside
   from statistical inference of language based on the composed message,
   which would in turn leak information about the supposedly-
   confidential message body).

   Furthermore, implementors found that the phrase "Encrypted Message"
   in the subject line was sometimes understood by users to be an
   indication from the MUA that the message was actually encrypted.  In
   practice, when some MUA failed to encrypt a message in a thread that
   started off with an obscured "Subject:", the value "Re: Encrypted
   Message" was retained even on those cleartext replies, resulting in
   user confusion.

   In contrast, using "..." as the obscured "Subject:" was less likely
   to be seen as an indicator from the MUA of message encryption, and it
   also neatly sidesteps the localization problems.

7.2.  Reply/Forward Losing Subjects

   When the user of a legacy MUA replies to or forwards a message where
   the Subject has been obscured, it is likely that the new subject will
   be "Fwd: ..." or "Re: ..." (or the localized equivalent).  This
   breaks an important feature: people are used to continuity of subject
   within a thread.  It is especially unfortunate when a new participant
   is added to a conversation who never saw the original subject.

   At this time, there is no known workaround for this problem.  The
   only solution is to upgrade the MUA to support Protected Headers.

   The authors consider this to be only a minor concern in cases where
   encryption is being used because confidentiality is important.
   However, in more opportunistic cases, where encryption is being used
   routinely regardless of the sensitivity of message contents, this
   cost becomes higher.

7.3.  Usability Impact of Reduced Metadata

   Many mail user agents maintain an index of message metadata
   (including header data), which is used to rapidly construct mailbox
   overviews and search result listings.  If the process which generates
   this index does not have access to the encrypted payload of a
   message, or does not implement Protected Headers, then the index will
   only contain the obscured versions Exposed Headers, in particular an
   obscured Subject of "...".



Einarsson, et al.          Expires 7 May 2020                  [Page 18]

Internet-Draft Protected Headers for Cryptographic E-mail  November 2019


   For sensitive message content, especially in a hosted MUA-as-
   a-service situation ("webmail") where the metadata index is
   maintained and stored by a third party, this may be considered a
   feature as the subject is protected from the third-party.  However,
   for more routine communications, this harms usability and goes
   against user expectations.

   Two simple workarounds exist for this use case:

   1.  If the metadata index is considered secure enough to handle
       confidential data, the protected content may be stored directly
       in the index once it has been decrypted.

   2.  If the metadata index is not trusted, the protected content could
       be re-encrypted and encrypted versions stored in the index
       instead, which are then decrypted by the client at display time.

   In both cases, the process which decrypts the message and processes
   the Protected Headers must be able to update the metadata index.

   FIXME: add notes about research topics and other non-simple
   workarounds, like oblivious server-side indexing, or searching on
   encrypted data.

7.4.  Usability Impact of Obscured Message-ID

   Current MUA implementations rely on the outermost Message-ID for
   message processing and indexing purposes.  This processing often
   happens before any decryption is even attempted.  Attempting to send
   a message with an obscured Message-ID header would result in several
   MUAs not correctly processing the message, and would likely be seen
   as a degradation by users.

   Furthermore, a legacy MUA replying to a message with an obscured
   "Message-ID:" would be likely to produce threading information
   ("References:", "In-Reply-To:") that would be misunderstood by the
   original sender.  Implementors generally disapprove of breaking
   threads.

7.5.  Usability Impact of Obscured From/To/Cc

   The impact of obscuring "From:", "To:", and "Cc:" headers has similar
   issues as discussed with obscuring the "Message-ID:" header in
   Section 7.4.

   In addition, obscuring these headers is likely to cause difficulties
   for a legacy client attempting formulate a correct reply (or "reply
   all") to a given message.



Einarsson, et al.          Expires 7 May 2020                  [Page 19]

Internet-Draft Protected Headers for Cryptographic E-mail  November 2019


7.6.  Mailing List Header Modifications

   Some popular mailing-list implementations will modify the Exposed
   Headers of a message in specific, benign ways.  In particular, it is
   common to add markers to the "Subject" line, and it is also common to
   modify either "From" or "Reply-To" in order to make sure replies go
   to the list instead of directly to the author of an individual post.

   Depending on how the MUA resolves discrepancies between the Protected
   Headers and the Exposed Headers of a received message, these mailing
   list "features" may either break or the MUA may incorrectly interpret
   them as a security breach.

   Implementors may for this reason choose to implement slightly
   different strategies for resolving discrepancies, if a message is
   known to come from such a mailing list.  MUAs should at the very
   least avoid presenting false alarms in such cases.

8.  Comparison with Other Header Protection Schemes

   Other header protection schemes have been proposed (in the IETF and
   elsewhere) that are distinct from this mechanism.  This section
   documents the differences between those earlier mechanisms and this
   one, and hypothesizes why it has seen greater interoperable adoption.

   The distinctions include:

   *  backward compatibility with legacy clients

   *  compatibility across PGP/MIME and S/MIME

   *  protection for both confidentiality and signing

8.1.  S/MIME 3.1 Header Protection

   S/MIME 3.1 ([RFC3851]) introduces header protection via "message/
   rfc822" header parts.

   The problem with this mechanism is that many legacy clients
   encountering such a message were likely to interpret it as either a
   forwarded message, or as an unreadable substructure.

   For signed messages, this is particularly problematic - a message
   that would otherwise have been easily readable by a client that knows
   nothing about signed messages suddenly shows up as a message-within-
   a-message, just by virtue of signing.  This has an impact on _all_
   clients, whether they are cryptographically-capable or not.




Einarsson, et al.          Expires 7 May 2020                  [Page 20]

Internet-Draft Protected Headers for Cryptographic E-mail  November 2019


   For encrypted messages, whose interpretation only matters on the
   smaller set of cryptographically-capable legacy clients, the
   resulting message rendering is awkward at best.

   Furthermore, Formulating a reply to such a message on a legacy client
   can also leave the user with badly-structured quoted and attributed
   content.

   Additionally, a message deliberately forwarded in its own right
   (without preamble or adjacent explanatory notes) could potentially be
   confused with a message using the declared structure.

   The mechanism described here allows cryptographically-incapable
   legacy MUAs to read and handle cleartext signed messages without any
   modifications, and permits cryptographically-capable legacy MUAs to
   handle encrypted messages without any modifications.

   In particular, the Legacy Display part described in {#legacy-display}
   makes it feasible for a conformant MUA to generate messages with
   obscured Subject lines that nonetheless give access to the obscured
   Subject header for recipients with legacy MUAs.

8.2.  The Content-Type Property "forwarded=no" {forwarded=no}

   [I-D.draft-ietf-lamps-header-protection-requirements-00] contains a
   proposal that attempts to mitigate one of the drawbacks of the scheme
   described in S/MIME 3.1 (Section 8.1).

   In particular, it allows _non-legacy_ clients to distinguish between
   deliberately forwarded messages and those intended to use the defined
   structure for header protection.

   However, this fix has no impact on the confusion experienced by
   legacy clients.

8.3.  pEp Header Protection

   [I-D.draft-luck-lamps-pep-header-protection-03] is applicable only to
   signed+encrypted mail, and does not contemplate protection of signed-
   only mail.

   In addition, the pEp header protection involved for "pEp message
   format 2" has an additional "multipart/mixed" layer designed to
   facilitate transfer of OpenPGP Transferable Public Keys, which seems
   orthogonal to the effort to protect headers.

   Finally, that draft suggests that the exposed Subject header be one
   of "=?utf-8?Q?p=E2=89=A1p?=", "pEp", or "Encrypted message". "pEp" is



Einarsson, et al.          Expires 7 May 2020                  [Page 21]

Internet-Draft Protected Headers for Cryptographic E-mail  November 2019


   a mysterious choice for most users, and see Section 7.1 for more
   commentary on why "Encrypted message" is likely to be problematic.

8.4.  DKIM

   [RFC6736] offers DKIM, which is often used to sign headers associated
   with a message.

   DKIM is orthogonal to the work described in this document, since it
   is typically done by the domain operator and not the end user
   generating the original message.  That is, DKIM is not "end-to-end"
   and does not represent the intent of the entity generating the
   message.

   Furthermore, a DKIM signer does not have access to headers inside an
   encrypted Cryptographic Layer, and a DKIM verifier cannot effectively
   use DKIM to verify such confidential headers.

8.5.  S/MIME "Secure Headers"

   [RFC7508] describes a mechanism that embeds message header fields in
   the S/MIME signature using ASN.1.

   The mechanism proposed in that draft is undefined for use with PGP/
   MIME.  While all S/MIME clients must be able to handle CMS and ASN.1
   as well as MIME, a standard that works at the MIME layer itself
   should be applicable to any MUA that can work with MIME, regardess of
   whether end-to-end security layers are provided by S/MIME or PGP/
   MIME.

   That mechanism also does not propose a means to provide
   confidentiality protection for headers within an encrypted-but-not-
   signed message.

   Finally, that mechanism offers no equivalent to the Legacy Display
   described in Section 5.  Instead, sender and receiver are expected to
   negotiate in some unspecified way to ensure that it is safe to remove
   or modify Exposed Headers in an encrypted message.

8.6.  Triple-Wrapping

   [RFC2634] defines "Triple Wrapping" as a means of providing cleartext
   signatures over signed and encrypted material.  This can be used in
   combination with the mechanism described in [RFC7508] to authenticate
   some headers for transport using S/MIME.

   But it does not offer confidentiality protection for the protected

Internet-Draft Protected Headers for Cryptographic E-mail  November 2019


   headers, and the signer of the outer layer of a triple-wrapped
   message may not be the originator of the message either.

   In practice on today's Internet, DKIM ([RFC6736] provides a more
   widely-accepted cryptographic header-verification-for-transport
   mechanism than triple-wrapped messages.

9.  Test Vectors

   The subsections below provide example messages that implement the
   Protected Header scheme.

   The secret keys and OpenPGP certificates from
   [I-D.draft-bre-openpgp-samples-00] can be used to decrypt and verify
   them.

   They are provided in textual source form as [RFC2822] messages.

9.1.  Signed Message with Protected Headers

   This shows a clearsigned message.  Its MIME message structure is:

   └┬╴multipart/signed
    ├─╴text/plain ← Cryptographic Payload
    └─╴application/pgp-signature

   Note that if this message had been generated without Protected
   Headers, then an attacker with access to it could modify the Subject
   without invalidating the signature.  Such an attacker could cause Bob
   to think that Alice wanted to cancel the contract with BarCorp
   instead of FooCorp.

9.2.  Signed and Encrypted Message with Protected Headers

   This shows a simple encrypted message with protected headers.  The
   encryption also contains an signature in the OpenPGP Message
   structure.  Its MIME message structure is:




Einarsson, et al.          Expires 7 May 2020                  [Page 24]

Internet-Draft Protected Headers for Cryptographic E-mail  November 2019


   └┬╴multipart/encrypted
    ├─╴application/pgp-encrypted
    └─╴application/octet-stream
      ↧ (decrypts to)
      └─╴text/plain ← Cryptographic Payload

   The "Subject:" header is successfully obscured.

   Note that if this message had been generated without Protected
   Headers, then an attacker with access to it could have read the
   Subject.  Such an attacker would know details about Alice and Bob's
   business that they wanted to keep confidential.

   The protected headers also protect the authenticity of subject line
   as well.

   The session key for this message's crypto layer is an AES-256 key
   with value
   "8df4b2d27d5637138ac6de46415661be0bd01ed12ecf8c1db22a33cf3ede82f2"
   (in hex).

   If Bob's MUA is capable of interpreting these protected headers, it
   should render the "Subject:" of this message as "BarCorp contract
   signed, let's go!".

   Hi Bob!

   I just signed the contract with BarCorp and they've set us up with an account
   on their system for testing.

   The account information is:

           Site: https://barcorp.example/
       Username: examplecorptest
       Password: correct-horse-battery-staple

   Please get the account set up and apply the test harness.

   Let me know when you've got some results.

   Thanks, Alice

9.3.  Signed and Encrypted Message with Protected Headers and Legacy
      Display Part

   If Alice's MUA wasn't sure whether Bob's MUA would know to render the
   obscured "Subject:" header correctly, it might include a legacy
   display part in the cryptographic payload.

   This message is structured in the following way:

   └┬╴multipart/encrypted
    ├─╴application/pgp-encrypted
    └─╴application/octet-stream
      ↧ (decrypts to)
      └┬╴multipart/mixed ← Cryptographic Payload
       ├─╴text/rfc822-headers ← Legacy Display Part
       └─╴text/plain

   The example below shows the same message as Section 9.2.





Einarsson, et al.          Expires 7 May 2020                  [Page 27]

Internet-Draft Protected Headers for Cryptographic E-mail  November 2019


   If Bob's MUA is capable of handling protected headers, the two
   messages should render in the same way as the message in Section 9.2,
   because it will know to omit the Legacy Display part as documented in
   Section 5.2.

   But if Bob's MUA is capable of decryption but is unaware of protected
   headers, it will likely render the Legacy Display part for him so
   that he can at least see the originally-intended "Subject:" line.

   For this message, the session key is an AES-256 key with value
   "95a71b0e344cce43a4dd52c5fd01deec5118290bfd0792a8a733c653a12d223e"

9.5.  Multilayer Message with Protected Headers and Legacy Display Part

   And, a mailer that generates a multilayer cryptographic envelope
   might want to provide a Legacy Display part, if it is unsure of the
   capabilities of the recipient's MUA.  We show here how sucha mailer
   might generate the same message as Section 9.2.

   Such a message might have the following structure:

   └┬╴multipart/encrypted
    ├─╴application/pgp-encrypted
    └─╴application/octet-stream
     ↧ (decrypts to)
     └┬╴multipart/signed
      ├┬╴multipart/mixed ← Cryptographic Payload
      │├─╴text/rfc822-headers ← Legacy Display Part
      │└─╴text/plain
      └─╴application/pgp-signature

   For this message, the session key is an AES-256 key with value
   "b346a2a50fa0cf62895b74e8c0d2ad9e3ee1f02b5d564c77d879caaee7a0aa70"
   (in hex).

   Hi Bob!

   I just signed the contract with BarCorp and they've set us up with an account
   on their system for testing.

   The account information is:

           Site: https://barcorp.example/
       Username: examplecorptest
       Password: correct-horse-battery-staple

   Please get the account set up and apply the test harness.

   Let me know when you've got some results.

   Thanks, Alice

9.6.  An Unfortunately Complex Example

   For all of the potential complexity of the Cryptographic Envelope,
   the Cryptographic Payload itself can be complex.  The Cryptographic
   Envelope in this example is the same as the previous example
   (Section 9.5).  The Cryptographic Payload has protected headers and a
   legacy display part (also the same as Section 9.5), but in addition
   Alice's MUA composes a message with both plaintext and HTML variants,
   and Alice includes a single attachment as well.

   While this message is complex, a modern MUA could also plausibly
   generate such a structure based on reasonable commands from the user
   composing the message (e.g., Alice composes the message with a rich
   text editor, and attaches a file to the message).

   The key takeaway of this example is that the complexity of the
   Cryptographic Payload (which may contain a Legacy Display part) is
   independent of and distinct from the complexity of the Cryptographic
   Envelope.

   This message has the following structure:

   └┬╴multipart/encrypted
    ├─╴application/pgp-encrypted
    └─╴application/octet-stream
     ↧ (decrypts to)
     └┬╴multipart/signed
      ├┬╴multipart/mixed ← Cryptographic Payload
      │├─╴text/rfc822-headers ← Legacy Display Part
      │└┬╴multipart/mixed
      │ ├┬╴multipart/alternative
      │ │├─╴text/plain
      │ │└─╴text/html
      │ └─╴text/x-diff ← attachment
      └─╴application/pgp-signature

   For this message, the session key is an AES-256 key with value
   "1c489cfad9f3c0bf3214bf34e6da42b7f64005e59726baa1b17ffdefe6ecbb52"

10.  IANA Considerations

   FIXME: register content-type parameter for legacy-display part

   MAYBE: provide a list of user-facing headers, or a new "user-facing"
   column in some table of known RFC5322 headers?

   MAYBE: provide a comparable indicator for which headers are
   "structural" ?

11.  Security Considerations

   This document describes a technique that can be used to defend
   against two security vulnerabilities in traditional end-to-end
   encrypted e-mail.

11.1.  Subject Leak

   While e-mail structure considers the Subject header to be part of the
   message metadata, nearly all users consider the Subject header to be
   part of the message content.

   As such, a user sending end-to-end encrypted e-mail may inadvertently
   leak sensitive material in the Subject line.

   If the user's MUA uses Protected Headers and obscures the Subject
   header as described in Section 4.2 then they can avoid this breach of
   confidentiality.

11.2.  Signature Replay

   A message without Protected Headers may be subject to a signature
   replay attack, which attempts to violate the recipient's expectations
   about message authenticity and integrity.  Such an attack works by
   taking a message delivered in one context (e.g., to someone else, at
   a different time, with a different subject, in reply to a different
   message), and replaying it with different message headers.




Einarsson, et al.          Expires 7 May 2020                  [Page 41]

Internet-Draft Protected Headers for Cryptographic E-mail  November 2019


   A MUA that generates all its signed messages with Protected Headers
   gives recipients the opportunity to avoid falling victim to this
   attack.

   Guidance for how a message recipient can use Protected Headers to
   defend against a signature replay attack are out of scope for this
   document.

11.3.  Participant Modification

   A trivial (if detectable) attack by an active network adversary is to
   insert an additional e-mail address in a "To" or "Cc" or "Reply-To"
   or "From" header.  This is a staging attack against message
   confidentiality - it relies on followup action by the recipient.

   For an encrypted message that is part of an ongoing discussion where
   users are accustomed to doing "reply all", such an insertion would
   cause the replying MUA to encrypt the replying message to the
   additional party, giving them access to the conversation.  If the
   replying MUA quotes and attributes cleartext from the original
   message within the reply, then the attacker learns the contents of
   the encrypted message.

   As certificate discovery becomes more automated and less noticeable
   to the end user, this is an increasing risk.

   An MUA that rejects Exposed Headers in favor of Protected Headers
   should be able to avoid this attack when replying to a signed
   message.

12.  Privacy Considerations

   This document only explicitly contemplates confidentiality protection
   for the Subject header, but not for other headers which may leak
   associational metadata.  For example, "From" and "To" and "Cc" and
   "Reply-To" and "Date" and "Message-Id" and "References" and "In-
   Reply-To" are not explicitly necessary for messages in transit, since
   the SMTP envelope carries all necessary routing information, but an
   encrypted [RFC2822] message as described in this document will
   contain all this associational metadata in the clear.

   Although this document does not provide guidance for protecting the
   privacy of this metadata directly, it offers a platform upon which
   thoughtful implementations may experiment with obscuring additional
   e-mail headers.

13.1.  Document History

14.  Acknowledgements

   The set of constructs and algorithms in this document has a previous
   working title of "Memory Hole", but that title is no longer used as
   different implementations gained experience in working with it.

   These ideas were tested and fine-tuned in part by the loose
   collaboration of MUA developers known as [Autocrypt].

   Additional feedback and useful guidance was contributed by attendees
   of the OpenPGP e-mail summit ([OpenPGP-Email-Summit-2019]).

   The following people have contributed implementation experience,
   documentation, critique, and other feedback:

   *  Holger Krekel

   *  Patrick Brunschwig

   *  Vincent Breitmoser
