  1.      Introduction 
      
     This specification defines the naming syntax, object classes, 
     attributes, matching filters, and query processing rules for 
     storing and locating IPv4 address blocks in the FIRS service. 
     Refer to [FIRS-ARCH] for information on the FIRS architecture and 
     [FIRS-CORE] for the schema definitions and rules which govern the 
     FIRS service as a whole. 
      
     Note that reverse-lookup DNS domains for IPv4 address blocks are 
     managed as DNS domain entries in [FIRS-DNS]. These are entirely 
     different network resources, and should not be confused with IPv4 
     address block entries. 
      
     The definitions in this specification are intended to be used with 
     FIRS. Their usage outside of FIRS is not prohibited, but any such 
     usage is beyond this specification's scope of authority. 
      
  2.      Prerequisites and Terminology 
      
     The complete set of specifications in the FIRS collection 
     cumulative define a structured and distributed information service 
     using LDAPv3 for the data-formatting and transport functions. This 
     specification should be read in the context of that set, which 
     currently includes [FIRS-ARCH], [FIRS-CORE], [FIRS-DNS],  
     [FIRS-DNSRR], [FIRS-CONTCT], [FIRS-ASN] and [FIRS-IPV6].

     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
     NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" 
     in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. 
      
  3.      Naming Syntax 
      
     The naming syntax for IPv4 address blocks in FIRS MUST follow the 
     form of "cn=<inetIpv4NetworkSyntax>,cn=inetResources,<partition>", 
     where <inetIpv4NetworkSyntax> is the IPv4 address block resource, 
     and where <partition> is a sequence of domainComponent relative 
     distinguished names which identifies the scope of authority for 
     the selected directory partition. 
      
     The inetIpv4NetworkSyntax rules use the traditional "dotted-quad" 
     notation, where each of four sub-components provide a decimal 
     value that represents one octet from a 32-bit IPv4 address, with 
     the sub-components being separated by a full-stop (period) 
     character, and with the four-part sequence being followed by a "/" 
     character and a decimal "prefix" value. 
      
     Entries which use the inetIpv4NetworkSyntax MUST use the starting 
     address from a range of inclusive addresses, and MUST use CIDR 
     prefix notation. In this manner, it is possible to create an 
     inetIpv4Network entry for a range of addresses of any size 
     (including a single host). 
      
     The leading zeroes from each octet MUST be removed before the 
     value is stored or used in a query. Octets which have a value of 
     zero MUST be represented by the single-digit value of "0". 
      
     If an input string does not match this syntax, a FIRS-aware 
     application MAY attempt to manipulate the input string to form a 
     valid value. For example, if a user enters a traditional IPv4 
     address without specifying a prefix value, the application MAY 
     append "/32" to the end of the input string to form a valid 
     assertion value. Similarly, if a user provides an octal or 
     hexadecimal value, the client MAY attempt to convert the input 
     string to the traditional dotted-quad IPv4 address notation. 
      
     An augmented BNF for this syntax is as follows: 
      
          inetIpv4NetworkSyntax = inetIpv4Octet "." inetIpv4Octet "." 
            inetIpv4Octet "." inetIpv4Octet "/" inetIpv4Prefix

  Internet Draft    draft-ietf-crisp-firs-ipv4-02.txt        July 2003 
   
   
          inetIpv4Octet = decimal value between "0" and "255" 
            inclusive, with the non-affective leading zeroes removed 
      
          inetIpv4Prefix = decimal value between "1" and "32" 
            inclusive, with the non-affective leading zeroes removed 
      
     The schema definition for inetIpv4NetworkSyntax is as follows: 
      
          inetIpv4NetworkSyntax 
          ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.7161.1.5.0 NAME 'inetIpv4NetworkSyntax' DESC 
            'An IPv4 address and prefix.' ) 
      
     For example, an IPv4 address block with a range of addresses 
     between "10.0.0.0" and "10.0.255.255" inclusive would be written 
     as "cn=10.0.0.0/16", while a host address of "192.0.2.14" would be 
     written as "cn=192.0.2.14/32". 
      
     Note that the entry name of "cn=0.0.0.0/0" encompasses the entire 
     IPv4 address space. 
      
     Note that the use of "/" is illegal as data in URLs, and MUST be 
     escaped before it is stored in a URL as data. 
      
  4.      Object Classes and Attributes 
      
     IPv4 address block entries in FIRS MUST use the inetIpv4Network 
     object class, in addition to the mandatory object classes defined 
     in [FIRS-CORE]. IPv4 address block entries MUST be treated as 
     containers capable of holding subordinate entries. If an entry 
     exists as a referral source, the entry MUST also be defined with 
     the referral object class, in addition to the above requirements. 
      
     The inetIpv4Network object class is a structural object class 
     which is subordinate to the inetResources object class. The 
     inetIpv4Network object class has no mandatory attributes, although 
     it does have several optional attributes. The inetIpv4Network 
     object class also inherits the attributes defined in the 
     inetResources object class, including the "cn" naming attribute.

     The schema definition for the inetIpv4Network object class is as 
     follows: 
      
          inetIpv4Network 
          ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.7161.1.5.1

             inetIpv4Registrar $ inetIpv4Registry $ inetIpv4Contacts $ 
             inetIpv4RoutingContacts ) ) 
      
     The attributes from the inetIpv4Network object class are described 
     below: 
      
          inetIpv4Contacts 
          ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.7161.1.5.2

            NOTE: In an effort to facilitate internationalization and 
            programmatic processing, the current status of a delegation 
            is identified by a 16-bit integer. The values and status 
            mapping is as follows:

            Note that there is no status code for "unassigned"; 
            unassigned entries SHOULD NOT exist, and SHOULD NOT be 
            returned as answers. 
      
          inetIpv4Registrar 
          ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.7161.1.5.5

            NOTE: The inetIpv4Registrar attribute uses a URL to 
            indicate the registrar who delegated the address block. The 
            attribute structure is identical to the labeledURI 
            attribute, as defined in [RFC2798], including the URL and 
            textual comments. The data can refer to any valid URL.

  5.      Query Processing Rules 
      
     Queries for IPv4 address blocks have several special requirements, 
     as discussed in the following sections. 
      
     Refer to [FIRS-CORE] for general information about FIRS queries. 
      
  5.1.    Query Pre-Processing 
      
     Clients MUST ensure that the query input is normalized according 
     to the rules specified in section 3 before the input is used as 
     the assertion value in the resulting LDAP query. 
      
   
  Hall                  I-D Expires: February 2004             [page 7] 
  Internet Draft    draft-ietf-crisp-firs-ipv4-02.txt        July 2003 
   
   
     The authoritative partition for an IPv4 address block is 
     determined by mapping the normalized input to an associated 
     reverse-lookup DNS domain name, and then mapping the resulting DNS 
     domain name to a sequence of domainComponent labels. 
      
     The least-significant octet MUST include the subnet prefix in this 
     mapping process, except in those cases where the address falls on 
     an eight-bit boundary. In those cases where the address block 
     specifies a 32-bit host address, the subnet prefix MUST be 
     stripped from the input during the mapping process. In those cases 
     where the address block specifies a legacy "address class", the 
     least-significant octet and subnet prefix MUST both be stripped 
     from the input during the mapping process. These steps are 
     necessary in order to ensure that the reverse-pointer delegations 
     in the public DNS are correctly matched to the authoritative 
     partitions (note that these rules only apply to the mapping 
     process by which an authoritative partition is constructed, and do 
     not apply to the process by which the entry-specific relative 
     distinguished name is constructed). 
      
     For example, a host-specific IPv4 address block of "192.0.2.14/32" 
     would be mapped to the reverse-lookup DNS domain name of 
     "14.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa." which would in turn be mapped to 
     "dc=14,dc=2,dc=0,dc=192,dc=in-addr,dc=arpa". Meanwhile, the "Class 
     C" block of "192.0.2.0/24" would be mapped to the reverse-lookup 
     DNS domain name of "2.0.192.in-addr.arpa." which would in turn be 
     mapped to "dc=2,dc=0,dc=192,dc=in-addr,dc=arpa". Finally, a 
     classless IPv4 address block of "192.0.2.0/20" would be mapped to 
     the reverse-lookup domain name of "0/20.14.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa" 
     which would in turn be mapped to the fully-qualified distinguished 
     name of "dc=0/20,dc=14,dc=2,dc=0,dc=192,dc=in-addr,dc=arpa". 
      
  5.2.    Query Bootstrapping 
      
     FIRS clients MUST use the targeted bootstrap model by default for 
     IPv4 address block queries, using the "in-addr.arpa" zone as the 
     seed domain for the initial query. 
      
     FIRS clients MAY use the top-down or bottom-up bootstrap models 
     for queries if necessary or desirable. However, it is not likely 
     that entries will be found for all IPv4 address block resources 
     using these models. As such, the targeted bootstrap model will be 
     the most useful in most cases, and MUST be used by default.

  Internet Draft    draft-ietf-crisp-firs-ipv4-02.txt        July 2003 
   
   
      
  5.3.    LDAP Matching 
      
     If the server advertises the inetIpv4Network object class in the 
     firsVersion server control, FIRS clients MUST use the 
     inetIpv4NetworkMatch extensible matching filter in LDAP searches 
     for IPv4 network entries. 
      
     The inetIpv4NetworkMatch filter provides an identifier and search 
     string format which collectively inform a queried server that a 
     specific IPv4 address should be searched for, and that any 
     matching inetIpv4network object class entries should be returned. 
      
     The inetIpv4NetworkMatch extensibleMatch filter is defined as 
     follows: 
      
          inetIpv4NetworkMatch 
          ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.7161.1.0.5 NAME 'inetIpv4NetworkMatch' SYNTAX 
            inetIpv4NetworkSyntax ) 
      
     The assertion value MUST be a normalized IPv4 address, using the 
     inetIpv4NetworkSyntax defined in section 3. 
      
     A FIRS server MUST compare the assertion value against the RDN of 
     all entries in the inetResources container of the partition 
     specified in the search base which have an object class of 
     inetIpv4Network. Any entry with an object class of inetIpv4Network 
     and with a relative distinguished name which clearly encompasses 
     the IPv4 address provided in the assertion value MUST be returned. 
     Entries which do not clearly encompass the queried address MUST 
     NOT be returned. Entries which do not have an object class of 
     inetIpv4Network MUST NOT be returned. 
      
     In order to ensure that all of the relevant entries are found 
     (including any referrals), the search filters for these resources 
     MUST specify the inetIpv4Network object class along with the 
     search criteria. For example, "(&(objectclass=inetIpv4Network) 
     (1.3.6.1.4.1.7161.1.5.8:=192.0.2.0/24))" with a search base of 
     "cn=inetResources,dc=arin,dc=net" would find all of the 
     inetIpv4Network object class entries which were superior to the 
     "192.0.2.0/24" address block in the "dc=arin,dc=net" partition. 
      
     Note that the entry name of "cn=0.0.0.0/0" encompasses the entire 
     IPv4 address space. When used in conjunction with referrals, this 
     entry MAY be used to redirect all inetIpv4NetworkMatch queries to 
     another partition for subsequent processing.

     The matching filters defined in this specification MUST be 
     supported by FIRS clients and servers. FIRS servers MAY support 
     additional sub-string filters, soundex filters, or any other 
     filters they wish (these may be required to support generic LDAP 
     clients), although FIRS clients MUST NOT expect any additional 
     filters to be available. 
      
     If the server does not advertise support for the inetIpv4Network 
     object class in the firsVersion server control, the client MAY 
     choose to emulate this matching process through the use of 
     locally-constructed filters. Since the inetIpv4NetworkMatch filter 
     simply locates all of the entries in the delegation path to the 
     named network, it is possible that a client could emulate this 
     query by generating distinct queries for any entries associated 
     with the parent networks. 
      
     For example, if the user asked for information about the 
     "192.0.2.14/32" network resource but the server does not advertise 
     support for the inetIpv4Network object class, the client could 
     theoretically issue secondary queries for inetIpv4Network entries 
     with cn attributes that begin with "192.0.2" or "192.0". 
      
     Unfortunately, this kind of matching is not guaranteed to work in 
     most situations, and clients also need to be careful not to issue 
     overly-broad queries that match all answers. As such, if the 
     server advertises support for the inetIpv4Network object class in 
     the firsVersion control, then the client MUST use the 
     inetIpv4NetworkMatch filter defined above. 
      
  5.4.    Example Query 
      
     The following example assumes that the user has specified 
     "192.0.2.14/32" as the query value: 
      
        a.  Normalize the input, which is "192.0.2.14/32" in this case. 
      
        b.  Determine the canonical authoritative partition. 
      
            1.   Map the input sequence to the reverse-lookup domain 
                 name, which is "14.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa" in this case. 
      
            2.   Determine the initial domain name which is appropriate 
                 for the bootstrap model in use. In the default case of 
                 a targeted query, use "in-addr.arpa". In the case of a 
                 bottom-up query, use the label sequence determined in

                 step 5.4.b.1. In the case of a top-down query, set the 
                 domain name to "arpa". 
      
            3.   Map the domain name to an authoritative partition, 
                 which would be "dc=in-addr,dc=arpa" if the default 
                 bootstrap model were in use. 
      
        c.  Determine the search base for the query, which will be 
            "cn=inetResources,dc=arpa" if the defaults are used. 
      
        d.  Initiate a DNS lookup for the SRV resource records 
            associated with "_ldap._tcp.in-addr.arpa." For the purpose 
            of this example, assume that this lookup succeeds, with the 
            DNS response message indicating that "firs.iana.org" is the 
            preferred LDAP server. 
      
        e.  Submit an LDAPv3 query to the specified server, using 
            "(&(objectClass=inetIpv4Network) 
            (1.3.6.1.4.1.7161.1.5.8:=192.0.2.14/32))" as the matching 
            filter, "cn=inetResources,dc=in-addr,dc=arpa" as the search 
            base, and the global query defaults defined in [FIRS-CORE]. 
      
        f.  Assume that the queried server returns a continuation 
            reference referral which points to 
            "ldap:///cn=inetResources,dc=arin,dc=net". The 
            distinguished name element of 
            "cn=inetResources,dc=arin,dc=net" will be used as the new 
            search base, while "dc=arin,dc=net" will be used as the new 
            authoritative partition. 
      
        g.  Initiate a DNS lookup for the SRV resource records 
            associated with "_ldap._tcp. arin.net." For the purpose of 
            this example, assume that this lookup succeeds, with the 
            DNS response message indicating that "firs.arin.net" is the 
            preferred LDAP server. 
      
        h.  Submit an LDAPv3 query to the specified server, using 
            "(&(objectClass=inetIpv4Network) 
            (1.3.6.1.4.1.7161.1.5.8:=192.0.2.14/32)" as the matching 
            filter, "cn=inetResources,dc=arin,dc=net" as the search 
            base, and the global query defaults defined in [FIRS-CORE]. 
      
        i.  Assume that no other referrals are received. Display the 
            answer data which has been received and exit the query.

  6.      Security Considerations 
      
     Security considerations are discussed in [FIRS-ARCH]. 
      
  7.      IANA Considerations 
      
     This specification uses the "dc=in-addr,dc=arpa" directory 
     partition by default. It is expected that authoritative LDAP 
     partitions will be mapped to that zone, and that FIRS-capable LDAP 
     servers will be established to service this partition, with this 
     partition containing IPv4-specific entries which will provide 
     referrals to the appropriate RIR partitions. It is further 
     expected that IANA will oversee the creation and management of the 
     in-addr.arpa domain's LDAP SRV resource records, the 
     "dc=in-addr,dc=arpa" LDAP partition, and the necessary LDAP 
     servers. 
      
     The inetIpv4DelegationStatus attribute uses numeric code values. 
     It is expected that IANA will manage the assignment of these 
     values. 
      
     Additional IANA considerations are discussed in [FIRS-ARCH].

        *   Restructured the document set. 
      
        *   "Attribute references" have been eliminated from the

            actual data instead of URL pointers to data. Clients that 
            wish to retrieve these values will need to start new 
            queries using the data values instead of URLs.

            eliminated as unnecessary. 
      
        *   The inetIpv4Registrar and inetIpv4Registry attributes were 
            added.
