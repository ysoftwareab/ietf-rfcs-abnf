1.  Introduction

   Traditionally, Ethernet MAC rates were constrained to match the rates
   of the Ethernet PHY(s).  OIF recently approved Flex Ethernet (FlexE)
   Implementation Agreement [FlexE-IA], which can be used to provide a
   generic mechanism to support a variety of Ethernet MAC rates that may
   or may not correspond to any existing standard Ethernet PHY rate.  In
   this kind of network scenario, FlexE uses more than one Ethernet PHYs
   as server layer through inverse multiplexing and these Ethernet PHYs
   are bonded together as a FlexE group to carry FlexE client signal.
   The general capabilities supported by FlexE implementation includes:

      Bonding of Ethernet PHYs, e.g., supporting a 200G MAC over two
      bonded 100GBASE-R PHYs.

      Sub-rates of Ethernet PHYs, e.g., supporting a 50G MAC over a
      100GBASE-R PHY.

      Channelization within a PHY or a group of bonded PHYs, e.g,
      support a 150G and two 25G MACs over two bonded 100GBASE-R PHYs.

Internet-Draft            GMPLS FlexE Framework                July 2016


   Note that hybrids are also possible, for example a sub-rate of a
   group of bonded PHYs, for example, a 250G MAC over three bonded
   100GBASE-R PHYs.  For more use cases, you can refer to [draft-
   hussain-ccamp-flexe-usecases].

   In order to operate on the Ethernet PHYs, FlexE capable nodes uses a
   calendar to assign slot positions on sub-calendars on each PHY of the
   FlexE group for each of the FlexE clients.  The calendar has a
   granularity of 5G, and has a length of 20 slots per 100G of Ethernet
   PHYs.

   [FLEXE-FWK] defines a framework and the associated control plane
   requirements for the Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching
   (GMPLS) [RFC3945] based control of FlexE networks.

   Based on the requirements described in FlexE framework document, this
   document defines additional requirements and protocol extensions to
   Resource Reservation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) [RFC3473]
   to set up FlexE LSPs.

1.1.  FlexE Terminology

   For terminology related to flexible Ethernet, please refer to [FLEXE-
   FWK] and FlexE Implementation Agreement [FlexE-IA].

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Requirements for FlexE Signalling

   The requirements for establishing LSPs in a FlexE network is
   described in [FLEXE-FWK].

   The FlexE LSP is a control-plane representation of a FlexE Connection
   and MUST be carried by standard Ethernet PHY LSPs or ODU LSPs in the
   network.  So in order to set up an end-to-end FlexE LSP, Ethernet PHY
   LSPs or ODU LSPs MUST be set up in advance.  [FLEXE-FWK] gives a
   description of FlexE layer resource information needed to be reserved
   when signalling an end-to-end LSP, which include the identifier
   information used for indicate one specific FlexE LSP and resource
   assignment information for FlexE client.  This section gives a
   detailed description of these identifier and resource information.
   Based on these information, source equipment and destination
   equipment will be able to map and demap the FlexE clients from the
   FlexE group properly.

Internet-Draft            GMPLS FlexE Framework                July 2016


2.1.  FlexE Group

   As defined in FlexE Implementation Agreement, the FlexE Group refers
   to a group of from 1 to n bonded 100GBASE-R Ethernet PHYs.  Ethernet
   PHYs are bounded together and used as a whole through inverse
   multiplexing by the FlexE LSP.  FlexE LSPs between the same source
   and destination equipment SHOULD NOT have the same FlexE group
   number.  Source equipment and destination equipment SHOULD be aware
   of the existing of different FlexE group and which Ethernet PHYs are
   in which FlexE group.

   This FlexE group information MUST be carried in the generalized label
   of signalling message during LSP establishment if FlexE group is
   needed.

2.2.  PHY Number

   The PHY number is a dynamic and logical number that is assigned by
   control plane or management plane, which is unique within a pair of
   source and destination, and has a one-to-one correlation with
   physical port.  This PHY number information will also be carried in
   the FlexE overhead.  Source equipment and destination equipment
   SHOULD negotiate a value for every Ethernet PHYs within one FlexE
   group.

   The PHY number information MUST be carried in the generalized label
   of signalling message during LSP establishment.  Besides the PHY
   number carried in the generalized label, RSVP_HOP object MUST also be
   used to indicate the correlation between PHY number and physical port
   number.  The sequence of the PHY numbers listed in the generalized
   label SHOULD be in accordance with the physical ports carried in
   RSVP_HOP object.

2.3.  Partial-rate

   The partial-rate capability is usually supported by an OTN access
   equipment.  If an equipment supports partial-rate, it means this
   equipment has the capability of discarding unavailable slots and
   forwards the remaining slots across OTN transport network.  During
   the process of resource allocation, where the partial-rate would
   happen should be indicated.

2.4.  Slot Assignment

   The FlexE LSP forwards client signal based on the slot positions, so
   the equipment SHOULD be able to tell which slot is assigned to which
   client according to the generalized label carried in the signalling

   message.  This attribute SHOULD also take the unavailable slots
   information into consideration.

2.5.  Granularity

   Currently, only one kinds of 5G slot granularity is defined in OIF
   Flex Ethernet (FlexE) Implementation Agreement [FlexE-IA].  During
   signalling process, this information can be inferred through the
   bandwidth parameters and slot number information within one Ethernet
   PHY.

3.  Protocol Extensions

   This section defines the extensions to RSVP-TE signalling for GMPLS
   [RFC3473] to support FlexE networks.

3.1.  Traffic Parameters

   In RSVP-TE, the SENDER_TSPEC object in the Path message characterizes
   the traffic parameters for the data flow from the corresponding
   sender.  The FLOWSPEC object in the Resv message indicates the actual
   resource reservation.  As defined in [RFC3473], bandwidth encodings
   are carried in the SENDER_TSPEC and FLOWSPEC objects, and these
   values are set in the Peak Data Rate field of Int-Serv objects, see
   [RFC2210].  Other bandwidth/service related parameters in the object
   are ignored and carried transparently.  Signalling procedure of RSVP-
   TE used in FlexE network can also reuse the SENDER_TSPEC object
   defined in [RFC2210] to describe the traffic parameters for the data
   flow of the sender.

3.2.  Generalized Label

   In the case of FlexE network, the GMPLS labels are used to locally
   represent the FlexE connections and its associated slots
   transferring.  Parameters defined in section 3 are needed to be
   carried in the generalized label to represent the FlexE connections.

   The following is the GENERALIZED_LABEL object format that is used
   with the TDM Switching Type:

                           Figure 1: FlexE Label

      FlexE Group Number: 20 bits

      The FlexE Group refers to a group of from 1 to n bonded 100GBASE-R
      Ethernet PHYs.

      Flags:

      Currently, only one flag is allocated to indicate the
      configuration of "A" calendar or "B" calendar.

      Client Indicator:

      This field is used to represent a value which can be filled in the
      client calendar of the FlexE overhead, and the client calendar is
      used to indicate which of the FlexE clients is mapped into a given
      calendar slot in the A and B calendar configurations for the sub-
      calendar carried over that PHY.  For slots in any PHYs with the
      same value, they belong to the same FlexE client.

      PHY number: 8 bits

      The PHY number is a dynamic and logical number that is assigned
      through control plane or management plane, which is unique within
      the context of (source, destination), and has a one-to-one
      correlation with physical port.  This information will also be
      carried in the FlexE overhead.

      Slots Assignment information (bitmap) : 20 bits

      This attribute is used to indicate slots assignment information,
      including slots assigned for the client, which are indicated by




Wang                     Expires January 9, 2017                [Page 6]

      the bit set to"1" and slots unused, which are indicated by the bit
      set to "0".

      U field: 4 bits

      This field is used to indicate the number of unavailable slot.  As
      defined in OIF FlexE Implementation Agreement, unavailable slots
      are always at the end of the sub-calendar configuration for the
      respective PHY, so this draft uses a specific field to describe
      them.

   Note: the number of the Ethernet PHY used by FlexE can be referred
   from the number of the "PHY number" in the generalized label.

3.3.  Flag extensions in Hop Attributes TLVs

   The Attribute Flags TLV defined in [RFC5420] is carried in an ERO Hop
   Attributes subobject.  Flags set in the Attribute Flags TLV [RFC5420]
   carried in an ERO Hop Attributes subobject SHALL be interpreted in
   the context of the received ERO.  Only a subset of defined flags are
   defined as valid for use in Attribute Flags TLV carried in an ERO Hop
   Attributes subobject.  Invalid flags SHALL be silently ignored.

   A new bit in the Attribute Flags TLV is assigned to indicate the
   partial-rate mux and demux.  This ERO Hop Attributes subobject MUST
   come in pairs.  The node which do the partial-rate mux MUST check the
   existence of partial-rate demux flag in the ERO Hop Attributes
   subobject of the path message.  If it does not exist, path will not
   be set up successfully.

3.4.  FlexE Link Available Slot Number TLV

   As indicated in [FlexE-IA], the number of PHY used by FlexE at both
   ends of the OTN network SHOULD be the same in aware case, or the OTN
   may encounter demux problem due to the format of FlexE 66 bits
   overhead blocks.  So in this link available slot number TLV, there
   should have a number of PHY field to collect the number of the PHY
   needed at both ends of the OTN network.

   Also a new FlexE Link Available Slot Number TLV is extended in the
   LSP_ATTRIBUTES object to calculate the number of end-to-end available
   slots.  This TLV contains several 1 byte fields which correspond to a
   Ethernet PHY, and it is used to collect the number of available slots
   can be used at most along an end-to-end LSP.

3.5.  Signalling Procedure

   This section gives description of FlexE layer model in different
   cases.  Figure 2 depicts a FlexE layered network scenario.  In this
   network, B and E are FlexE capable nodes, C and D are OTN ODUflex/
   ODU4 switch capable nodes.  Node B, C are mainly used to encapsulate
   the client layer signal into the server layer, while node D, E are
   mainly used to extract the client layer signal from the server layer
   signal.

3.5.1.  Procedure for Setting up FlexE LSP in Unaware Case

   In this case, node C and node D are unaware of the FlexE signal.

   Suppose node B receives a FlexE client path set up request from node
   B to node E and the bandwidth of this path is 150G.  There are three
   Ethernet PHYs between B and C, D and E.  Also there exist enough ODU4
   connections between node C and node D to bear the traffic from node
   B.  Following is the signalling procedure.

   a.  Node B intends to send the RSVP-TE path message to set up an end-
   to-end path towards the destination node E.  The bandwidth
   requirement is 150G.

   b.  Before node B begins to forward the FlexE client path message, it
   will first determine a new FlexE path needs to be set up from node B
   to node E to carry the Ethernet client traffic by comparing the
   switching capability carried in the FlexE client path message and the
   switching capability that node B can support.  Node B first blocks
   the Ethernet client path message, then initiate another new path
   message to set up the FlexE path from node B to node E.  The
   requested switching capability of the FlexE path is set to TDM and
   the encoding type is set to "FlexE-LSP".

   Before node B send the FlexE path message towards the next hop, node
   B first check if there are enough Ethernet PHYs to carry the FlexE
   traffic.  Then node B will start the set up of two Ethernet PHYs LSP



Wang                     Expires January 9, 2017                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft            GMPLS FlexE Framework                July 2016


   from node B to node E.  The Ethernet PHY path messages are then sent
   towards the next hop node C.  Two Ethernet PHY LSPs will be set up.

   c.  When node C receives the Ethernet PHY path messages from node B,
   it will first determine two new ODU4 path needs to be set up first
   from node C to node D to carry the Ethernet PHY traffic by comparing
   the switching capability carried in the path message and the
   switching capability that node C can support.  Node C first blocks
   the Ethernet PHY path message, then initiate another new path
   messages to set up the ODU4 path from node C to node D.

   Considering the set up of ODU4 path is not the focus of this draft,
   procedure of setting up ODU4 paths are not going to be described in
   this draft.  Node C will receive the Resv message from node D and
   confirm the successful set up of ODU4 paths.  The ODU4 LSPs behave as
   the server layer of Ethernet PHY paths.

   d.  Node C will then continue sending the Ethernet PHY path messages
   towards node E to finish the set up of Ethernet PHY LSPs.  The
   Ethernet PHY LSPs from node B to node E behave as the a link with
   only one hop.

   e.  After node B receives the Resv message from node E and confirm
   the successful set up of Ethernet PHY paths, node B will continue
   sending the FlexE path message towards the next hop node E.  The
   bandwidth requirement is 150G.

   f.  Node E receives the FlexE path message from node B.  Considering
   there are already two Ethernet PHYs from node B to node E, node E
   determines to set up the FlexE path over the two Ethernet PHYs by
   carrying the assigned FlexE group number, dynamic PHY number and slot
   positions for the Ethernet client in the generalized label.

   Besides the generalized label, RSVP_HOP object MUST also be used to
   indicate the correlation between PHY number and physical port number.
   The sequence of the PHY numbers listed in the generalized label
   SHOULD be in accordance with the physical ports number carried in
   RSVP_HOP object.

   Node E then send the Resv message toward the FlexE path source, node
   B, to finish the set up of FlexE path.

   g.  After node B receive the Resv message from node E and confirm the
   successful set up of FlexE path, node B will continue sending the
   blocked FlexE client path message towards the destination node E to
   finish the set up of the client path.

   FlexE LSP appears as an Ethernet client link once it was set up.
   Unused bandwidth on the FlexE LSP can be used further by another
   FlexE client.

3.5.2.  Procedure for Setting up FlexE LSP in Aware Case

   In this case, node C and node D are aware of the FlexE signal.

   Suppose node B receives a FlexE client path set up request from node
   B to node E and the bandwidth of this path is 150G.  There are three
   Ethernet PHYs between B and C, D and E.  Also there exist 180G
   ODUFlex connections between node C and node D to bear the traffic
   from node B.  The number of unavailable slots between B and C is 4,
   between D and E is 5.  Following is the signalling procedure.

   a.  Node B intends to send the RSVP-TE path message to set up an end-
   to-end path towards the destination node E.  The bandwidth
   requirement is 150G.

   b.  Before node B begins to transfer the FlexE client path message,
   it will first determine a new FlexE path needs to be set up from node
   B to node E to carry the FlexE client traffic by comparing the
   switching capability carried in the FlexE client path message and the
   switching capability that node B can support.  As node B is aware of
   the existence of unavailable slots between node B and node C, node D
   and node E, Node B's computation element will compute an end-to-end
   partial-rate supported path B-C-D-E.  Node B then first blocks the
   Ethernet client path message, then initiate another new path message
   to set up the FlexE path from node B to node E.  The requested
   switching capability of the FlexE path is set to TDM and the encoding
   type is set to "Partial-rate FlexE-LSP".

   c.  Before node B send the FlexE path message towards the next hop,
   node B first check if there are enough Ethernet PHYs to carry the
   FlexE traffic.  Then node B will start the set up of two Ethernet
   PHYs LSP from node B to node E with the G-PID field set to "Partial-
   rate FlexE-LSP".  The Ethernet PHY path messages are then sent
   towards the next hop node C.  Two Ethernet PHY LSPs will be set up.

   d.  When node C receives the Ethernet PHY path messages which are
   used to support partial-rate FlexE-LSP from node B, it will first
   check if itself support partial-rate capability as a result of the
   "Partial-rate FlexE-LSP" carried in G-PID.  Node C then sends the
   Resv message to node B to finish the set up of Ethernet PHYs LSP if
   it confirms the support of partial-rate capability.

   e.  When node B receives the Ethernet PHYs resv message from node C,
   it will first finish the set up of Ethernet PHYs LSP, then continue

   sending the FlexE path message towards next hop node C carrying the
   FlexE Link Available Slot Number TLV to record the number of PHYs and
   available slots on the link between node B and node C.  Before the
   sending of FlexE path message, neighbor discovery process needs to be
   run to negotiate the number of unavailable slots.  These Ethernet PHY
   LSPs behave as a one hop FlexE link in the FlexE network.

   f.  When node C receives the FlexE path message, node B first block
   the FlexE path message, then checks if there are ODUFlex LSP
   available to carry the FlexE traffic.  If no, node B first initiate
   the ODUFlex LSP set up and the bandwidth requested does not take the
   unavailable slots into consideration.

   Considering the set up of ODUFlex path is not the focus of this
   draft, procedure of setting up ODUFlex paths are not going to be
   described in this draft.  Node C will receive the Resv message from
   node D and confirm the successful set up of ODUFlex paths.  The
   ODUFlex LSPs behave as a one hop FlexE link in the FlexE network.

   g.  When node C receives the ODUFlex Resv message from node D.  It
   will first finish the set up of ODUFlex LSP, then continue sending
   the FlexE path message towards next hop node D.  Node C first
   compares the currently number carried in the path message with the
   number of the available slots supported on link between node C and
   node D, then fills in the FlexE Link Available Slot Number TLV with
   the smaller one.  These ODUFlex LSPs behave as a one hop FlexE link
   in the FlexE network and this link carries all FlexE slots except
   unavailable slots.

   h.  When node D receives the FlexE path message, it will repeat the
   procedure in c, d, e.  Node E will receive the FlexE path message
   sent from node B and it will construct the Resv message sent back to
   node B to finish the FlexE client resource reservation along the
   path.

   Note: in this case, if node D is aware of the number of PHY needed
   between node B, node C and node D, node E is different, it will
   trigger a path error message and send back to node B to indicate the
   larger one.

   i.  After node B receives the FlexE Resv message, it first finish the
   path set up and then continue the blocked FlexE client signalling
   procedure.
