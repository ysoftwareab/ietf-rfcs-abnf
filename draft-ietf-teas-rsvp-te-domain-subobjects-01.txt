     Domain Subobjects for Resource ReserVation Protocol - Traffic
                         Engineering (RSVP-TE)
              draft-ietf-teas-rsvp-te-domain-subobjects-01

Abstract

   The Resource ReserVation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE)
   specification and the Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (GMPLS) extensions to RSVP-TE allow abstract nodes and resources to
   be explicitly included in a path setup.  Further Exclude Routes
   extensions to RSVP-TE allow abstract nodes and resources to be
   explicitly excluded in a path setup.

   This document specifies new subobjects to include or exclude domains
   during path setup where domain is a collection of network elements
   within a common sphere of address management or path computational
   responsibility (such as an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) area or an
   Autonomous System (AS)).  Note that the use of AS as an abstract node
   representing domain is already defined in existing RSVP-TE
   specefications, albeit with a 2-Byte AS number.

1.  Introduction

   The RSVP-TE specification [RFC3209] and the GMPLS extensions to RSVP-
   TE [RFC3473] allow abstract nodes and resources to be explicitly
   included in a path setup using the Explicit Route Object (ERO).

   Further Exclude Routes extensions [RFC4874] allow abstract nodes or
   resources to be excluded from the whole path using the Exclude Route
   object (XRO).  To exclude certain abstract nodes or resources between
   a specific pair of abstract nodes present in an ERO, a Explicit
   Exclusion Route Subobject (EXRS) is used.

   [RFC3209] already describes the notion of abstract nodes, where an
   abstract node is a group of nodes whose internal topology is opaque
   to the ingress node of the Label Switched Path (LSP).  It further
   defines a subobject for AS, but with a 2-Byte AS number only.

   This document extends the notion of abstract nodes by adding new
   subobjects for IGP Areas and 4-byte AS numbers (as per [RFC6793]).
   These subobjects can be included in Explicit Route Object (ERO),
   Exclude Route Object (XRO) or Explicit Exclusion Route Subobject
   (EXRS).

   In case of per-domain path computation [RFC5152], where the full path
   of an inter-domain TE LSP cannot be or is not determined at the
   ingress node, and signaling message could use domain identifiers.
   The use of these new subobjects is illustrated in Appendix A.

   Further, the domain identifier could simply act as delimiter to
   specify where the domain boundary starts and ends.

   This is a companion document to Path Computation Element Protocol
   (PCEP) extensions for the domain sequence [PCE-DOMAIN].

1.1.  Scope

   The procedures described in this document are experimental.  The
   experiment is intended to enable research for the usage of Domain
   subobjects for inter-domain path setup.  For this purpose this
   document specify new domain subobjects as well as how they
   incorporate with existing subobjects.

   This document does not change the procedures for handling subobjects
   in RSVP-TE.

   The new subobjects introduced by this document will not be understood
   by legacy implementations.  If one of the subobjects is received in a
   RSVP-TE object that does not understand it, it will behave as

   described in [RFC3209] and [RFC4874].  Therefore, it is assumed that
   this experiment will be conducted only when all nodes processing the
   new subobject form part of the experiment.

   When the result of implementation and deployment are available, this
   document will be updated and refined, and then be moved from
   Experimental to Standard Track.

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used in this document.

   AS:  Autonomous System.

   Domain:  As per [RFC4655], any collection of network elements within
      a common sphere of address management or path computational
      responsibility.  Examples of domains include Interior Gateway
      Protocol (IGP) areas and Autonomous Systems (ASs).

   ERO:  Explicit Route Object

   EXRS:  Explicit Exclusion Route Subobject

   IGP:  Interior Gateway Protocol.  Either of the two routing
      protocols, Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) or Intermediate System
      to Intermediate System (IS-IS).

   IS-IS:  Intermediate System to Intermediate System.

   OSPF:  Open Shortest Path First.

   PCE:  Path Computation Element.  An entity (component, application,
      or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or
      route based on a network graph and applying computational
      constraints.

   PCEP:  Path Computation Element Protocol.

   RSVP:  Resource Reservation Protocol

   TE LSP:  Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path.

   XRO:  Exclude Route Object

3.  Subobjects for Domains

3.1.  Domains

   [RFC4726] and [RFC4655] define domain as a separate administrative or
   geographic environment within the network.  A domain could be further
   defined as a zone of routing or computational ability.  Under these
   definitions a domain might be categorized as an AS or an IGP area.

   As per [RFC3209], an abstract node is a group of nodes whose internal
   topology is opaque to the ingress node of the LSP.  Using this
   concept of abstraction, an explicitly routed LSP can be specified as
   a sequence of IP prefixes or a sequence of Autonomous Systems.  In
   this document we extend the notion to include IGP area and 4-Byte AS
   number.

   These sub-objects appear in RSVP-TE, notably in -

   o  Explicit Route Object (ERO): As per [RFC3209], an explicit route
      is a particular path in the network topology including abstract
      nodes (including domains).

   o  Exclude Route Object (XRO): As per [RFC4874], an exclude route
      identifies a list of abstract nodes (including domains), that
      should not be traversed along the path of the LSP being
      established.

   o  Explicit Exclusion Route Subobject (EXRS): As per [RFC4874], used
      to specify exclusion of certain abstract nodes between a specific
      pair of nodes.  EXRS are a subobject carried inside the ERO.
      These subobjects can be used to specify the domains to be excluded
      between two abstract nodes.

3.2.  Explicit Route Object (ERO)'s Subobjects

   As stated in [RFC3209], an explicit route is a particular path in the
   network topology.  In addition to the ability to identify specific
   nodes along the path, an explicit route can identify a group of nodes
   (abstract nodes) to be traversed along the path.

   Some subobjects are defined in [RFC3209], [RFC3473], [RFC3477],
   [RFC4874] and [RFC5553] but new subobjects related to domains are
   needed.

   This document extends the support for 4-Byte AS numbers and IGP
   Areas.

3.2.1.  Autonomous system

   [RFC3209] already defines 2-Byte AS number.

   To support 4-Byte AS numbers as per [RFC6793], the following
   subobject is defined:

      0                   1                   2                   3

   L: The L bit is an attribute of the subobject as defined in

   Length:  8 (Total length of the subobject in bytes).

   Reserved:  Zero at transmission, ignored at receipt.

   AS-ID:  The 4-Byte AS Number.  Note that if 2-Byte AS numbers are in
      use, the low order bits (16 through 31) MUST be used and the high
      order bits (0 through 15) MUST be set to zero.

3.2.2.  IGP Area

   Since the length and format of Area-id is different for OSPF and
   ISIS, the following two subobjects are defined:

   For OSPF, the area-id is a 32 bit number.  The subobject is encoded
   as follows:

   L: The L bit is an attribute of the subobject as defined in

   Type:  (TBD2 by IANA) indicating a 4-Byte OSPF Area ID.

   Length:  8 (Total length of the subobject in bytes).

   Reserved:  Zero at transmission, ignored at receipt.

   OSPF Area Id:  The 4-Byte OSPF Area ID.

   For IS-IS, the area-id is of variable length and thus the length of
   the subobject is variable.  The Area-id is as described in IS-IS by
   ISO standard [ISO10589].  The subobject is encoded as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3

   Type:  (TBD3 by IANA) indicating IS-IS Area ID.

   Length:  Variable.  The Length MUST be at least 8, and MUST be a
      multiple of 4.

   Area-Len:  Variable (Length of the actual (non-padded) IS-IS Area
      Identifier in octets; Valid values are from 2 to 11 inclusive).

   Reserved:  Zero at transmission, ignored at receipt.

   IS-IS Area Id:  The variable-length IS-IS area identifier.  Padded
      with trailing zeroes to a four-byte boundary.

3.2.3.  Mode of Operation

   The new subobjects to support 4-Byte AS and IGP (OSPF / ISIS) Area
   could also be used in the ERO to specify an abstract node (a group of
   nodes whose internal topology is opaque to the ingress node of the
   LSP).

   All the rules of processing (for example Next Hop Selection, L bit
   processing, unrecognized subobjects etc) are as per the [RFC3209].
   Note that if a node is called upon to process subobject defined in
   this document, and it does not recognize, it will behave as described
   in [RFC3209] when an unrecognized ERO subobject is encountered.  This
   means that this node will return a PathErr with error code "Routing
   Error" and error value "Bad EXPLICIT_ROUTE object" with the
   EXPLICIT_ROUTE object included, truncated (on the left) to the
   offending subobject.

3.3.  Exclude Route Object (XRO)'s Subobjects

   As stated in [RFC4874], the exclude route identifies a list of
   abstract nodes that to exclude (not be traversed) along the path of
   the LSP being established.

   Some subobjects are defined in [RFC3209], [RFC3477], [RFC4874] and
   [RFC6001] but new subobjects related to domains are needed.

   This document extends the support for 4-Byte AS numbers and IGP
   Areas.

                Type    Subobject
                 TBD1   Autonomous system number (4 Byte)
                 TBD2   OSPF Area id
                 TBD3   ISIS Area id

3.3.1.  Autonomous system

   [RFC3209] and [RFC4874] already define a 2-Byte AS number.

   To support 4-Byte AS numbers as per [RFC6793], a subobject is with
   the same format as defined in Section 3.2.1 with following
   difference:

   The meaning of the L bit (similar to [RFC4874]).

   0: indicates that the abstract node (AS) specified MUST be excluded.

   1: indicates that the abstract node (AS) specified SHOULD be avoided.

3.3.2.  IGP Area

   Since the length and format of Area-id is different for OSPF and
   ISIS, the following two subobjects are defined:

   For OSPF, the area-id is a 32 bit number.  Subobjects for OSPF and
   IS-IS are of the same format as defined in Section 3.2.2 with
   following difference:

   The meaning of the L bit (similar to [RFC4874]).

   0: indicates that the abstract node (OSPF or IS-IS Area) specified
      MUST be excluded.

   1: indicates that the abstract node (OSPF or IS-IS Area) specified
      SHOULD be avoided.

3.3.3.  Mode of Operation

   The new subobjects to support 4-Byte AS and IGP (OSPF / ISIS) Area
   could also be used in the XRO to specify exclusion of an abstract
   node (a group of nodes whose internal topology is opaque to the
   ingress node of the LSP).

   All the rules of processing are as per the [RFC4874].

   Note that if a node is called upon to process a subobject defined in
   this document, and it does not recognize, it will behave as described
   in [RFC4874] when an unrecognized XRO subobject is encountered, i.e.
   to ignore it.  In this case the desired exclusion will not be carried
   out.

3.4.  Explicit Exclusion Route Subobject

   As per [RFC4874], the Explicit Exclusion Route is used to specify
   exclusion of certain abstract nodes between a specific pair of nodes
   or resources in the explicit route.  EXRS is an ERO subobject that
   contains one or more subobjects of its own, called EXRS subobjects.

   The EXRS subobject could carry any of the subobjects defined for XRO,
   thus the new subobjects to support 4-Byte AS and IGP (OSPF / ISIS)
   Area can also be used in the EXRS.  The meanings of the fields of the
   new XRO subobjects are unchanged when the subobjects are included in
   an EXRS, except that scope of the exclusion is limited to the single
   hop between the previous and subsequent elements in the ERO.

   All the rules of processing are as per the [RFC4874].

4.  Interaction with Path Computation Element (PCE)

   The domain subobjects to be used in Path Computation Element Protocol
   (PCEP) are referred to in [PCE-DOMAIN].  Note that the new domain
   subobjects follow the principle that subobjects used in PCEP
   [RFC5440] are identical to the subobjects used in RSVP-TE and thus
   are interchangeable between PCEP and RSVP-TE.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  New Subobjects

   IANA maintains the "Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Parameters"
   at http://www.iana.org/assignments/rsvp-parameters/rsvp-
   parameters.xhtml.  Within this registry IANA maintains two sub-

6.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for MPLS-TE and GMPLS signaling are covered
   in [RFC3209] and [RFC3473].  This document does not introduce any new
   messages or any substantive new processing, and so those security
   considerations continue to apply.  Further, general considerations
   for securing RSVP-TE in MPLS-TE and GMPLS networks can be found in
   [RFC5920].

   The route exclusion security consideration are covered in [RFC4874]
   and continue to apply.

Appendix A.  Examples

   These examples are for illustration purposes only, to show how the
   new subobjects could be encoded.  They are not meant to be an
   exhaustive list of all possible usecases and combinations.

A.1.  Inter-Area LSP Path Setup

   In an inter-area LSP path setup where the ingress and the egress
   belong to different IGP areas within the same AS, the domain
   subobjects could be represented using an ordered list of IGP area
   subobjects in an ERO.

   As per Figure 1, the signaling at Ingress could be -

A.2.  Inter-AS LSP Path Setup

A.2.1.  Example 1

   In an inter-AS LSP path setup where the ingress and the egress belong
   to different AS, the domain subobjects (AS) could be used in an ERO.


              AS A                AS E                AS C
         <------------->      <---------->      <------------->

                  A4----------E1---E2---E3---------C4
                 /           /                       \
               /            /                          \
             /            /       AS B                   \
           /            /      <---------->                \
     Ingress------A1---A2------B1---B2---B3------C1---C2------Egress
           \                                    /          /
             \                                /          /
               \                            /          /
                 \                        /          /
                  A3----------D1---D2---D3---------C3

                              <---------->
                                  AS D

     * All AS have one area (area 0)

                   Figure 2: Domain Corresponding to AS

   As per Figure 2, the signaling at Ingress could be -

   ERO:(A1, A2, AS B, AS C, Egress); or

   ERO:(A1, A2, AS B, Area 0, AS C, Area 0, Egress).

   Each AS has a single IGP area (area 0), Area subobject is optional.

   Note that to get a domain disjoint path, the ingress could also
   signal the backup path with -

   XRO:(AS B)

A.2.2.  Example 2

   As shown in Figure 3, where AS 200 is made up of multiple areas, the
   signaling can include both AS and Area subobject to uniquely identify
   a domain.
