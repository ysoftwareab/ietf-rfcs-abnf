1.  Introduction

   Artificial Intelligence is an important technical trend in the
   industry.  The two key aspects of Artificial Intelligence are
   perception and cognition.  Artificial Intelligence has evolved from
   an early non-learning expert system to a learning-capable machine
   learning era.  In recent years, the rapid development of the deep
   learning branch based on the neural network and the maturity of the
   big data technology and software distributed architecture make the
   Artificial Intelligence in many fields (such as transportation,
   medical treatment, education, etc.) have been applied.  With the
   development of network, it is necessary to introduce artificial
   intelligence technology to achieve self-adjustment, self-
   optimization, self-recovery of the network through collection of huge
   data of network state and machine learning.  The areas of machine
   learning which are easier to be used in the network field may

    Figure 1: An Architecture of Network Artificial Intelligence(NAI)


   The architecture of Network artificial intelligence includes
   following key components:

   (1) Central Controller: Centralized controller is the core part of
   Network Artificial Intelligence which can be called as 'Network



Li, et al.             Expires September 14, 2017               [Page 3]

   Brain'.  The Network Telemetry and Analytics (NTA) engines can be
   introduced acompanying with the central controller.  The Network
   Telemetry and Analytics (NTA) engine inclues data collector,
   analytics framework, data persistence, and NAI applications.

   (2) Network Device: IP network operation and maintenance are always a
   big challenge since the network can only provide limited state
   information.  The network states includes but are not limited to
   topology, traffic engineering, operation and maintenance information,
   network failure information and related information to locate the
   network failure.  In order to provide these information, the network
   must be able to support more OAM mechanisms to acquire more state
   information and report to the controller.  Then the controller can
   get the complete state information of the network which is the base
   of Network Artificial Intelligence(NAI).

   (3) Southbound Protocol and Models of Controller: As network devices
   provide huge network state information, it proposes a number of new
   requirements for protocols and models between controllers and network
   devices.  The traditional southbound protocol such as Netconf and
   SNMP can not meet the performance requirements.  It is necessary to
   introduce some new high-performance protocols to collect network
   state data.  At the same time, the models of network data should be
   completed.  Moreover with the introduction of new OAM mechanisms of
   network devices, new models of network data should be introduced.

   (4) Northbound Model of Controller: The goal of the Network
   Artificial Intelligence is to reduce the technical requirements on
   the network administrators and release them from the heavy network
   management, control, maintenance work.  The abstract northbound model
   of the controller for different network services should be simple and
   easy to be understood.

4.  Process

   NAI consists of following processes:

   -- Data Collection

   From the time aspect, data collection can be divided into real-time
   data collection and non-real-time collection.

   From the content aspect, data collection can be divided into network
   information collection (including topology, tunnels, routing,
   equipment configuration, etc.) and traffic collection (the collection
   network traffic, network load, device KPI, etc.).

   -- Data Storage

Internet-Draft           An Architecture of NAI               March 2017


   Store data collected from network.  Many existing big data storage
   technologies can be used here.

   -- Data Processing

   This is preliminary data processing too select effective data and
   simply analyse data relationship.

   -- Analyse

   Analyse engine will provide the data analysis results using machine
   learning algorithm.

   -- Closed Loop Control

   According to the results of intelligent analysis and policy set by
   user, the centrol controller will implement closed-loop control of
   the network.

5.  Classification

   NAI can be divided into off-line process and on-line process in
   accordance to the time aspect of the data collection and analysis.

   Off-line process refers to process of the existing data, or non-real-
   time collection data.  Although the analysis process will also focus
   on the relationship between data and time, but it does not require
   real-time analysis.  Off-line process is mainly used for two
   purposes: (1) training or verification of real-time process design;
   (2) trouble shooting or reason analysis for events that have already
   occurred.

   On-line process is efficient real-time collection, processing and
   analysis of the data, to operate network monitoring and event
   forecasting.  The main purpose of the on-line process are: (1)
   network capacity monitoring and precise optimizing; (2) network event
   prediction and fast trouble shooting; (3) real-time network
   optimization according to the policy.

6.  Requirement of Protocol Extensions

6.1.  Requirement of Southbound Protocols

   REQ 01: The southbound protocol of the controller should be
   introduced to meet the performance requirements of collecting huge
   data of network states.

Internet-Draft           An Architecture of NAI               March 2017


   The soundbound protocol can be based on the extensions of the
   existing traditional protocols such link state colloction protocols,
   PCEP[RFC5440], BMP[RFC7854], etc.  Or the new protocol like
   Telemetry[I-D.kumar-rtgwg-grpc-protocol] can be introduced as the
   soundbound protocols.  The protocol choice will be based on the
   application scenarios of NAI.

6.2.  Requirement of Data Collection

   REQ 02: The data collected from the network devices includes but not
   limites to following information:

   -- network topology information

   -- routing protocol status

   -- IP routes and MAC routes

   -- LSP information

   -- network traffic inforamtion

   -- network configuration

   -- network device KPIs

   -- log of network elements

   -- trap of network elements

   -- OAM information

6.3.  Requirement of Devices

   REQ 03: New OAM mechanisms should be introduced for the network
   devices in order to acquire more types of network state data.

6.4.  Requirement of Northbound Interface

   REQ 04: The abstract network-based service models should be provided
   by the controller as the northbound models to satisfy the
   requirements of different services.
