1.  Introduction

   While using CMP [RFC4210] in industrial and IoT environments and
   developing the Lightweight CMP Profile
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile] some limitations were
   identified in the original CMP specification.  This document updates
   RFC 4210 [RFC4210] to overcome these limitations.

   In general, this document aims to improve the crypto agility of CMP
   to be flexible to react on future advances in cryptography.

   This document also introduces new extended key usages to identify CMP
   endpoints on registration and certification authorities.

Internet-Draft                 CMP Updates                     July 2020


1.1.  Convention and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS.  Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying significance described in RFC 2119.

   Technical terminology is used in conformance with RFC 4210 [RFC4210],
   RFC 4211 [RFC4211], and RFC 5280 [RFC5280].  The following key words
   are used:

   CA:  Certification authority, which issues certificates.

   RA:  Registration authority, an optional system component to which a
        CA delegates certificate management functions such as
        authorization checks.

   KGA: Key generation authority, which generates key pairs on behalf of
        an EE.  The KGA could be co-located with an RA or a CA.

   EE:  End entity, a user, device, or service that holds a PKI
        certificate.  An identifier for the EE is given as its subject
        of the certificate.

2.  Updates to RFC 4210 - Certificate Management Protocol (CMP)

2.1.  New Section 1.1. - Changes since RFC 4210

   The following subsection describes feature updates to RFC 4210
   [RFC4210].  They are always related to the base specification.  Hence
   references to the original sections in RFC 4210 [RFC4210] are used
   whenever possible.

   Insert this section at the end of the current Section 1.

   1.1 Changes since RFC 4210

   The following updates are made in draft-ietf-lamps-cmp-updates:

   o  Add new extended key usages for different CMP server types, e.g.
      registration authority and certification authority, to express the
      authorization of the entity identified in the certificate
      containing the respective extended key usage extension to act as
      the indicated PKI management entity.

Internet-Draft                 CMP Updates                     July 2020


   o  Extend the description of multiple protection to cover additional
      use cases, e.g., batch processing of messages.

   o  Offering EnvelopedData as the prefered choice next to
      EncryptedValue to extend crypto agility in CMP.  Note that
      according to RFC 4211 [RFC4211] section 2.1.9 the use of the
      EncryptedValue structure has been deprecated in favor of the
      EnvelopedData structure.  RFC 4211 [RFC4211] offers the
      EncryptedKey structure, a choice of EncryptedValue and
      EnvelopedData for migration to EnvelopedData.  For reasons of
      completeness and consistency the exchange of EncryptedValue is
      performed for all usages in RFC 4210 [RFC4210].  This includes the
      protection of centrally generated private keys, encryption of
      certificates, and revocation passphrases.

   o  Extend the usage of polling also to p10cr messages.

2.2.  New Section 4.5 - Extended Key Usage

   The following subsection describes new extended key usages for
   different CMP server typesspecitied in RFC 4210 [RFC4210].

   Insert this section at the end of the current Section 4.

   4.5 Extended Key Usage

   The Extended Key Usage (EKU) extension indicates the purposes for
   which the certified public key may be used.  It therefore restricts
   the use of a certificate to specific applications.

   A CA may want to delegate parts of their duties to other PKI
   management entities.  The mechanism to prove this delegation
   explained in this section offers zero-touch means to check the
   authorization of such delegation.  Such delegation could also be
   expressed by other means, e.g., explicit configuration.

   To offer automatic validation means for the delegation of a role by a
   CA, the certificates used by PKI management entities for CMP message
   protection or signed data for central key generation MUST be issued
   by the delegating CA and MUST contain the respective EKUs.  This
   proves the authorization of this entity by the delegating CA to act
   as the PKI management entity as described below.

   The ASN.1 to define these EKUs is:

   id-kp-cmcCA OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-kp 27 }
   id-kp-cmcRA OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-kp 28 }
   id-kp-cmKGA OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-kp ... }

Internet-Draft                 CMP Updates                     July 2020


   < TBD: id-kp-cmKGA to be defined. >

   Note: RFC 6402 section 2.10 [RFC6402] specifies OIDs for a CMC CA and
   a CMC RA.  As the functionality of a CA and RA is not specific to
   whether use CMC or CMP as certificate management protocol, the same
   OIDs SHALL be used for a CMP CA and a CMP RA.

   < TBD: The Description of the OIDs needs to be extended to avoid
   confusion as they currently only refer to CMC endpoints. >

   The description of the PKI management entity for each of the EKUs is
   as follows:

   CMP CA:  CMP Certification Authorities are CMP endpoints on CA
            equipment as described in section 3.1.1.2.  The key used in
            the context of CMP management operations, especially CMP
            message protection, need not be the same key that signs the
            certificates.  It is necessary, however, to ensure that the
            entity acting as CMP CA is authorized to do so.  Therefore,
            the CMP CA MUST do one of the following,

            *  use the CA private key on the CMP endpoint, or

            *  explicitly designate this authority to another entity.

            For automatic validation of such delegation it MUST be
            indicated by the id-kp-cmcCA extended key usage.  This
            extended key usage MUST be placed into the certificate used
            on the CA equipment and the CA that delegates this role MUST
            issue the CMP CA certificate.

            Note: Using a separate key pair for protecting CMP
            management operations at the CA decreases the number of
            operations of the private key used to sign certificates.

   CMP RA:  CMP Registration Authorities are CMP endpoints on RA
            equipment as described in Section 3.1.1.3.  A CMP RA is
            identified by the id-kp-cmcRA extended key usage.  This
            extended key usage is placed into RA certificates.  The CA
            that delegated this role is identified by the CA that issued
            the CMP RA certificate.

   CMP KGA: CMP Key Generation Authorities are identified by the id-kp-
            cmKGA extended key usage.  Though the CMP KGA knows the
            private key it generated on behalf of the end entity.  This
            is a very sensible service and needs specific authorization.
            This authorization is either with the CA certificate itself,
            or indicated by placing the id-kp-cmKGA extended key usage

            into the CMP RA or CMP CA certificate used to authenticate
            the origin of the private key, and to express the
            authorization to offer this service.

   Note: In device PKIs, especially those issuing IDevID certificates,
   CA may have very long validity (including the GeneralizedTime value
   99991231235959Z to indicate a not well-defined expiration date as
   specified in IEEE 802.1AR Section 8.5 [IEEE802.1AR] and RFC 5280
   Section 4.1.2.5 [RFC5280]).  Such validity periods SHOULD NOT be used
   for protection of CMP messages.  Certificates for delegated CMP
   message protection (CMP CA, CMP RA, CMP KGA) MUST NOT use indefinite
   expiration date.

2.3.  Replace Section 5.1.3.4 - Multiple Protection

   Section 5.1.3.4 of RFC 4210 [RFC4210] describes the nested message.
   This document opens the usage of nested messages also for batch
   transport of PKI messages between different PKI management entities.

   Replace the text of the section with the following text.

   In cases where an end entity sends a protected PKI message to an RA,
   the RA MAY forward that message to a CA, adding its own protection
   (which MAY be a MAC or a signature, depending on the information and
   certificates shared between the RA and the CA).  There are different
   use cases for such multi protected messages.

   o  The RA confirms the validation and authorization of a message and
      forwards the original message unchanged.

   o  The RA collects several messages and forwards them in a batch.
      This can for instance be used to bridge an off-line connection
      between two PKI management entities.  In communication to the CA
      request messages and in communication from the CA response or
      announcement messages will be collected in such batch.

   o  The RA modifies the message(s) in some way (e.g., add or modify
      particular field values or add new extensions) before forwarding
      them, then it MAY create its own desired PKIBody.  In case the
      changes made by the RA to PKIMessage breaks the POP, the RA MUST
      either set the POP RAVerified or include the original PKIMessage
      from the EE in the generalInfo field of PKIHeader of the nested
      message (to force the CA to check POP on the original message).
      The infoType to be used in this situation is {id-it 15} (see
      Section 5.3.19 for the value of id-it) and the infoValue is
      PKIMessages (contents MUST be in the same order as the requests in
      PKIBody).  For simplicity reasons, if batching is used in
      combination with inclusion of the original PKIMessage in the

Internet-Draft                 CMP Updates                     July 2020


      generalInfo field, all messages in the batch MUST be of the same
      type (e.g., ir).

   These use cases are accomplished by nesting the messages sent by the
   PKI entity within a new PKI message.  The structure used is as
   follows.

   NestedMessageContent ::= PKIMessages

   (The use of PKIMessages, a SEQUENCE OF PKIMessage, lets the RA batch
   the requests of several EEs in a single new message.)

2.4.  Replace Section 5.2.2. - Encrypted Values

   Section 5.2.2 of RFC 4210 [RFC4210] describes the usage of
   EncryptedValue to transport encrypted data.  This document extends
   the encryption of data to preferably use EnvelopedData.

   Replace the text of the section with the following text.

   Where encrypted data (restricted, in this specification, to be either
   private keys, certificates, or passwords) are sent in PKI messages,
   the EncryptedKey data structure is used.

   EncryptedKey ::= CHOICE {
      encryptedValue        EncryptedValue, -- deprecated
      envelopedData     [0] EnvelopedData }

   See CRMF [RFC4211] for EncryptedKey and EncryptedValue syntax and for
   EnvelopedData syntax see CMS [RFC5652].  Using the EncryptedKey data
   structure, the choice to either use EncryptedValue (for backward
   compatibility only) or EnvelopedData is offered.  The use of the
   EncryptedValue structure has been deprecated in favor of the
   EnvelopedData structure.  Therefore, it is recommended to use
   EnvelopedData.

   The EncryptedKey data structure is used in CMP to either transport a
   private key, certificate or revocation passphrase in encrypted form.

   EnvelopedData is used as follows:

   o  Contains only one recepientInfo structure because the content is
      encrypted only for one recipient.

   o  Contains a private key in a SignedData structure as specified in
      CMS section 5 [RFC5652] signed by the Key Generation Authority.

Internet-Draft                 CMP Updates                     July 2020


   o  Contains a certificate or revocation passphrase directly in the
      encryptedContent field.

   Note: When transferring a centrally generated private key in a
   certificate response message to the EE, the algorithm identifier and
   the associated public key will anyhow be transported in this response
   message.  Therefore, the private key will not be delivered in a key
   package structure as specified in [RFC5958] and [RFC6032].  But the
   wrapping of the private key in a SignedData structure that is wrapped
   in the EnvelopedData structure as specified in [RFC6032] is applied.

   The content of the EnvelopedData structure, as specified in CMS
   section 6 [RFC5652], MUST be encrypted using a newly generated
   symmetric content-encryption key.  This content-encryption key MUST
   be securely provided to the recipient using one of three key
   management techniques.

   The choice of the key management technique to be used by the sender
   depends on the credential available for the recipient:

   o  Jointly shared secret: The content-encryption key will be
      protected using the password-based key management technique, as
      specified in CMS section 6.2.4 [RFC5652].

   o  Recipient's certificate that contains a key usage extension
      asserting keyAgreement: The content-encryption key will be
      protected using the key agreement key management technique, as
      specified in CMS section 6.2.2 [RFC5652].

   o  Recipient's certificate that contains a key usage extension
      asserting keyEncipherment: The content-encryption key will be
      protected using the key transport key management technique, as
      specified in CMS section 6.2.1 [RFC5652].

2.5.  Update Section 5.3.4. - Certification Response

   Section 5.3.4 of RFC 4210 [RFC4210] describes the Certification
   Response.  This document updates the syntax by using the parent
   structure EncryptedKey instead of EncryptedValue as described in
   Section 2.1 above.

   Replace the ASN.1 syntax of CertifiedKeyPair and CertOrEncCert with
   the following text.

   }

   CertOrEncCert ::= CHOICE {
       certificate     [0] Certificate,
       encryptedCert   [1] EncryptedKey
   }

   Add the following paragraphs to the end of the section.

   The use of EncryptedKey is described in section 5.2.2.

2.6.  Replace Section 5.3.19.9. - Revocation Passphrase

   Section 5.3.19.9 of RFC 4210 [RFC4210] describes the provisioning of
   a revocation passphrase for authenticating a later revocation
   request.  This document updates the handling by using the parent
   structure EncryptedKey instead of EncryptedValue to transport this
   information as described in Section 2.1 above.

   Replace the text of the section with the following text.

   This MAY be used by the EE to send a passphrase to a CA/RA for the
   purpose of authenticating a later revocation request (in the case
   that the appropriate signing private key is no longer available to
   authenticate the request).  See Appendix B for further details on the
   use of this mechanism.

   GenMsg:    {id-it 12}, EncryptedKey
   GenRep:    {id-it 12}, < absent >

   The use of EncryptedKey is described in section 5.2.2.

2.7.  Update Section 5.3.22 - Polling Request and Response

   Section 5.3.22 of RFC 4210 [RFC4210] describes when and how polling
   messages are used.  This document adds the polling mechanism also to
   outstanding p10cr transactions.

   Replace all paragraphs in front of the state machine diagram with the
   following text.

   This pair of messages is intended to handle scenarios in which the
   client needs to poll the server in order to determine the status of

   an outstanding ir, cr, p10cr, or kur transaction (i.e., when the
   "waiting" PKIStatus has been received).

   PollReqContent ::= SEQUENCE OF SEQUENCE {
       certReqId    INTEGER }

   PollRepContent ::= SEQUENCE OF SEQUENCE {
       certReqId    INTEGER,
       checkAfter   INTEGER,  -- time in seconds
       reason       PKIFreeText OPTIONAL }

   The following clauses describe when polling messages are used, and
   how they are used.  It is assumed that multiple certConf messages can
   be sent during transactions.  There will be one sent in response to
   each ip, cp, or kup that contains a CertStatus for an issued
   certificate.

   1  In response to an ip, cp, or kup message, an EE will send a
      certConf for all issued certificates and, following the ack, a
      pollReq for all pending certificates.

   2  In response to a pollReq, a CA/RA will return an ip, cp, or kup if
      one or more of the pending certificates is ready; otherwise, it
      will return a pollRep.

   3  If the EE receives a pollRep, it will wait for at least as long as
      the checkAfter value before sending another pollReq.

   4  If an ip, cp, or kup is received in response to a pollReq, then it
      will be treated in the same way as the initial response.

   Note: A p10cr message contains exactly one CertificationRequestInfo
   data structure as specified in PKCS#10 [RFC2986] but no certificate
   request number.  Therefore, the certReqId MUST be set to 0 in all
   following messages of this transaction.

2.8.  Update Appendix B - The Use of Revocation Passphrase

   Appendix B of RFC 4210 [RFC4210] describes the usage of the
   revocation passphrase.  As this document updates RFC 4210 [RFC4210]
   to utilize the parent structure EncryptedKey instead of
   EncryptedValue as described in Section 2.1 above, the description is
   updated accordingly.

   Replace the first bullet point of this section with the following
   text.

      sent in the generalInfo field of the PKIHeader of any PKIMessage
      at any time.  (In particular, the EncryptedKey as described in
      section 5.2.2 may be sent in the header of the certConf message
      that confirms acceptance of certificates requested in an
      initialization request or certificate request message.)  This
      conveys a revocation passphrase chosen by the entity (i.e., for
      use of EnvelopedData this is in the decrypted bytes of
      encryptedContent field and for use of EncryptedValue this is in
      the decrypted bytes of the encValue field) to the relevant CA/RA;
      furthermore, the transfer is accomplished with appropriate
      confidentiality characteristics.

   Replace the third bullet point of this section with the following
   text.

   o  When using EnvelopedData the localKeyId attribute as specified in
      RFC 2985 [RFC2985] and when using EncryptedValue the valueHint
      field MAY contain a key identifier (chosen by the entity, along
      with the passphrase itself) to assist in later retrieval of the
      correct passphrase (e.g., when the revocation request is
      constructed by the entity and received by the CA/RA).

2.9.  Update Appendix C - Request Message Behavioral Clarifications

   Appendix C of RFC 4210 [RFC4210] provides clarifications to the
   request message behavior.  As this document updates RFC 4210
   [RFC4210] to utilize the parent structure EncryptedKey instead of
   EncryptedValue as described in Section 2.1 above, the description is
   updated accordingly.

   Replace the note coming after the ASN.1 syntax of POPOPrivKey of this
   section with the following text.

   -- **********
   -- *  the type of "thisMessage" is given as BIT STRING in RFC 4211
   -- *  [RFC4211]; it should be "EncryptedKey" (in accordance with
   -- *  Section 5.2.2 of this specification). Therefore, this document
   -- *  makes the behavioral clarification of specifying that the
   -- *  contents of "thisMessage" MUST be encoded either as
   -- *  "EnvelopedData" or "EncryptedValue" (only for backward
   -- *  compatibility) and then wrapped in a BIT STRING.  This allows
   -- *  the necessary conveyance and protection of the private key
   -- *  while maintaining bits-on-the-wire compatibility with RFC 4211
   -- *  [RFC4211].
   -- **********

2.10.  Update Appendix D.4. - Initial Registration/Certification (Basic
       Authenticated Scheme)

   Appendix D.4 of RFC 4210 [RFC4210] provides the initial registration/
   certification scheme.  This scheme shall continue to use
   EncryptedValue for backward compatibility reasons.

   Replace the comment after the privateKey field of
   crc[1].certifiedKeyPair in the syntax of the Initialization Response
   message with the following text.

   -- see Appendix C, Request Message Behavioral Clarifications
   -- for backward compatibility reasons, use EncryptedValue

3.  IANA Considerations

   < TBD: A new OID for id-kp-cmKGA needs to be requested. >

   < TBD: The existing description and information of id-kp-cmcRA and
   id-kp-cmcCA need to be updated to reflect their extended usage.  >

4.  Security Considerations

   No changes are made to the existing security considerations of
   RFC 4210 [RFC4210].

5.  Acknowledgements

   Special thank goes to Jim Schaad for his guidance and the inspiration
   on structuring and writing this document I got from [RFC6402] that
   updates CMC.

   I also like to thank all reviewers of this document for their
   valuable feedback.
