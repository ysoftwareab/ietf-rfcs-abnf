<a name="rfc.section.1"></a><h3>1.&nbsp;
Problem Statement</h3>

<p>
				In the context of this document, low-power wireless personal area networks
				(LoWPANs) are formed by devices that are compatible with the IEEE 802.15.4
				standard  <a class='info' href='#refs.IEEE802.15.4'>[refs.IEEE802.15.4]<span> (</span><span class='info'>IEEE Computer Society, &ldquo;IEEE Std. 802.15.4-2006 (as amended),&rdquo; 2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. Most of the LoWPAN devices
				are distinguished by their low bandwidth, short range, scarce memory
				capacity, limited processing capability and other attributes of
				inexpensive hardware.  The characteristics of nodes
				participating in LoWPANs are assumed to be those described in the 6LoWPAN problem statement <a class='info' href='#RFC4919'>[RFC4919]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kushalnagar, N., Montenegro, G., and C. Schumacher, &ldquo;IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs): Overview, Assumptions, Problem Statement, and Goals,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.
			
</p>
<p>
				IEEE 802.15.4 networks support star and mesh topologies.
				However, neither the IEEE 802.15.4 standard nor the 6LoWPAN format
				specification ("IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4" <a class='info' href='#RFC4944'>[RFC4944]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Montenegro, G., Kushalnagar, N., Hui, J., and D. Culler, &ldquo;Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 802.15.4 Networks,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>) define
				how mesh topologies could be obtained and maintained. Thus, the 6LoWPAN
				formation and multi-hop routing should be supported by higher layers,
				either the 6LoWPAN adaptation layer or the IP layer. A number
				of IP routing protocols have been developed in various
				IETF working groups. However, these existing routing protocols may not
				satisfy the requirements of multi-hop routing in 6LoWPANs, for the following
				reasons:
				</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
						6LoWPAN nodes have special types and roles, such as nodes drawing their power from primary batteries,
						power-affluent nodes, mains-powered and high-performance gateways,
						data aggregators, etc. 6LoWPAN routing protocols should support multiple device types
						and roles.
					
</li>
<li>
						More stringent requirements apply to LoWPANs, as opposed
						to higher performance or non-battery-operated networks.
						6LoWPAN nodes are characterized by small memory sizes,
						low processing power, and are running on very limited power supplied
						by primary non-rechargeable batteries (a few KBytes of RAM,
						a few dozens of KBytes of ROM/flash memory, and a few MHz of CPU is
						typical).  A node's lifetime is usually defined by the lifetime of
						its battery.
					
</li>
<li>
						Handling sleeping nodes is very critical in LoWPANs, more than in
						traditional ad-hoc networks. LoWPAN nodes might stay in sleep-mode
						for most of the time. Taking advantage of appropriate times for transmissions is important for efficient
						forwarding of packets.
					
</li>
<li> 
						Routing in 6LoWPANs might possibly translate to a simpler problem
						than routing in higher-performance networks. LoWPANs might be either
						transit networks or stub networks.  Under the assumption that LoWPANs
						are never transit networks (as implied by <a class='info' href='#RFC4944'>[RFC4944]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Montenegro, G., Kushalnagar, N., Hui, J., and D. Culler, &ldquo;Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 802.15.4 Networks,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>),
						routing protocols may be
						drastically simplified. This document will focus on the requirements for stub
						networks. Additional requirements may apply to transit networks.
					
</li>
<li>
						Routing in LoWPANs might possibly translate to a harder problem
						than routing in higher-performance networks. Routing in LoWPANs
						requires power-optimization, stable operation in harsh environments,
						data-aware routing, etc.  These requirements are not easily
						satisfiable all at once <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-protocols-survey'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;protocols&#8209;survey]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Tavakoli, A., Dawson-Haggerty, S., and P. Levis, &ldquo;Overview of Existing Routing Protocols for Low Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.
					
</li>
</ul><p>

				 This creates new challenges on obtaining robust and reliable routing within LoWPANs.
			
</p>
<p>
				The 6LoWPAN problem statement document ("6LoWPAN Problems and Goals" <a class='info' href='#RFC4919'>[RFC4919]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kushalnagar, N., Montenegro, G., and C. Schumacher, &ldquo;IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs): Overview, Assumptions, Problem Statement, and Goals,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>)
				briefly mentions four requirements on routing protocols;
				</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>(a) low overhead on data packets
</p>
<p>(b) low routing overhead
</p>
<p>(c) minimal memory and computation requirements
</p>
<p>(d) support for sleeping nodes considering battery saving
</p>
</blockquote><p>
				
				These four high-level requirements describe the basic need for 6LoWPAN routing.
				Based on the fundamental features of 6LoWPAN, more detailed routing requirements
				are presented in this document,
				which can lead to further analysis and protocol design.
			
</p>
<p>
				Using the 6LoWPAN header format <a class='info' href='#RFC4944'>[RFC4944]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Montenegro, G., Kushalnagar, N., Hui, J., and D. Culler, &ldquo;Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 802.15.4 Networks,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>, there are two layers
				routing protocols can be defined at, commonly referred to
				as "Mesh Under" and "Route Over". The Mesh Under approach performs its routing below the IP link.
				It therefore is directly based on the link-layer IEEE 802.15.4 standard,
			        using (64-bit or 16-bit short) MAC addresses. On the other hand,
				the Route Over approach relies on IP routing and therefore supports
				routing over possibly various types of interconnected links
				(see also <a class='info' href='#NetworkStack'>Figure&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mesh-under (left) and route-over routing (right)</span><span>)</span></a>). Most statements in this document consider
				both the Mesh Under and Route Over cases.
				<br />

				
				Note: The ROLL WG is now working on Route Over approaches for Low power
				and Lossy Networks (LLNs), not specifically for 6LoWPAN.
                This document focuses on 6LoWPAN-specific requirements; it may be used in conjunction with the more application-oriented requirements defined by the ROLL WG.
			
</p>
<p>
				Considering the problems above, detailed 6LoWPAN routing requirements
				must be defined.  Application-specific features affect the design of
				6LoWPAN routing requirements and the corresponding solutions.
				However, various applications can be profiled by similar technical
				characteristics, although the related detailed requirements might differ
				(e.g., a few dozens of nodes for home lighting system need appropriate
				scalability for the applications, while millions of nodes for a
				highway infrastructure system also need appropriate scalability).
				This document states the routing requirements of 6LoWPAN applications
				in general, while trying to give examples for different cases of routing.
				This routing requirements document does not imply that a single
				routing solution may be the best one for all 6LoWPAN applications.

				the existence of a Mesh Under routing protocol in order to reach the ER.
				For Route Over, the IPv6 address of (b) is set as the destination of the packets, and

Scenario Considerations and Parameters for 6LoWPAN Routing</h3>

				IP-based LoWPAN technology is still in its early stage of
				development, but the range of conceivable usage scenarios is
				tremendous.  The numerous possible applications of sensor networks
				make it obvious that mesh topologies will be prevalent in LoWPAN
				environments and robust routing will be a necessity for expedient
				communication.  Research efforts in the area of sensor networking
				have put forth a large variety of multi-hop routing algorithms

				Most related work focuses on optimizing
				routing for specific application scenarios, which can be realized using
				several models of communication, including the following ones <a class='info' href='#refs.cctc'>[refs.cctc]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Lu, J., Valois, F., Dohler, M., and D. Barthel, &ldquo;Quantifying Organization by Means of Entropy,&rdquo; 2008.</span><span>)</span></a>:

<dd>Network Properties:
				
<ul class="text">
<li>
						Number of Devices, Density and Network Diameter: <br />

						These parameters usually affect the routing state directly
						(e.g. the number of entries in a routing table or neighbor
						list).  Especially in large and dense networks, policies must
						be applied for discarding "low-quality" and stale routing
						entries in order to prevent memory overflow.
					
</li>
<li>
						Connectivity: <br />

						Due to external factors or programmed disconnections, a LoWPAN
						can be in several states of connectivity; anything in the
						range from "always connected" to "rarely connected".  This
						poses great challenges to the dynamic discovery of routes
						across a LoWPAN.
					
</li>
<li>
						Dynamicity (including mobility): <br />

						Location changes can be induced by unpredictable external
						factors or by controlled motion, which may in turn cause route
						changes.  Also, nodes may dynamically be introduced into a
						LoWPAN and removed from it later.  The routing state and the
						volume of control messages may heavily depend on the number
						of moving nodes in a LoWPAN and their speed, as well as how quickly and frequently environmental characteristics influencing radio propagation change.
					
</li>
<li>
						Deployment: <br />

						In a LoWPAN, it is possible for nodes to be scattered randomly
						or to be deployed in an organized manner.  The deployment can
						occur at once, or as an iterative process, which may also
						affect the routing state.
					
</li>
<li>
						Spatial Distribution of Nodes and Gateways: <br />

						Network connectivity depends on the spatial distribution of the nodes,
						and on other factors such as device number, density and transmission
						range. For instance, nodes can be placed on a grid, or can be randomly placed in
						an area (as can be modeled by a bidimensional Poisson distribution), etc.
						In addition, if the LoWPAN is connected to other networks through
						infrastructure nodes called gateways, the number and spatial
						distribution of gateways affects network congestion and available
						data rate, among others.
					
</li>
<li>
						Traffic Patterns, Topology and Applications: <br />

						The design of a LoWPAN and the requirements on its application
						have a big impact on the network topology and the most efficient routing type to be
						used.  For different traffic patterns (point-to-point,
						multipoint-to-point, point-to-multipoint) and network
						architectures, various routing mechanisms have been
						developed, such as data-aware, event-driven, address-centric,
						and geographic routing.
					
</li>
<li>
						Classes of Service: <br />

						For mixing applications of different criticality on one LoWPAN, support of multiple classes of
						service may be required in resource-constrained LoWPANs and may
						require a certain degree of routing protocol overhead.
					
</li>
<li>
						Security: <br />

						LoWPANs may carry sensitive information and require a high
						level of security support where the availability, integrity,
						and confidentiality of data are of prime relevance.  Secured messages
						cause overhead and affect the power consumption of LoWPAN
						routing protocols.
					
</li>
</ul> 
        
</dd>
<dt>b.</dt>
<dd>Node Parameters:
				
<ul class="text">
<li>
						Processing Speed and Memory Size: <br />

						These basic parameters define the maximum size of the routing
						state and the maximum complexity of its processing. LoWPAN nodes may have different performance
						characteristics.
					
</li>
<li>
						Power Consumption and Power Source: <br />

						The number of battery- and mains-powered nodes and their positions in the topology created by them in
						a LoWPAN affect routing protocols in their selection of
						paths that optimize network lifetime.
					
</li>
<li>
						Transmission Range: <br />

						This parameter affects routing.  For example, a
						high transmission range may cause a dense network, which in
						turn results in more direct neighbors of a node, higher
						connectivity  and a larger routing state.
					
</li>
<li>
						Traffic Pattern: <br />

						This parameter affects routing since highly loaded nodes (either
						because they are the source of packets to be transmitted or due
						to forwarding) may contribute to higher delivery
						delays and may consume more energy than lightly loaded nodes.
						This applies to both data packets and routing control messages.

Support of 6LoWPAN Device Properties</h3>

<p>
					The general objectives listed in this section should be met
					by 6LoWPAN routing protocols. The importance of each requirement is
					dependent on what node type the protocol is running on and what
					the role of the node is. The following requirements consider the presence of battery-powered nodes in LoWPANs.
				
</p>
<p>
				    [R01] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD allow implementation with small code size
					and require low routing state to fit the typical 6LoWPAN node capacity.
                                        Generally speaking, the code size is bounded by available flash memory size, and the routing table is bounded by RAM size, possibly limiting it to less than 32 entries.
				
</p>
<p>
				</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p> 
            The RAM size of LoWPAN nodes often ranges between 4 KB (2 KB minimum) and 10 KB,
						and program flash memory normally consists of 48 KB to 128 KB.
						(e.g., in the current market, MICAz has 128 KB program flash,
						4 KB EEPROM, 512 KB external flash ROM; TIP700CM has 48 KB program
						flash, 10 KB RAM, 1 MB external flash ROM).
					
</p>
<p>
						Due to these hardware restrictions, code SHOULD
						fit within a small memory size; no more than 48 KB to 128 KB of flash memory including
						at least a few tens of KB of application code size.
						(As a general observation, a routing protocol of low
            complexity may help achieving
						the goal of reducing power consumption, improves robustness,
						requires lower routing state, is easier to analyze, and may be
						less prone to security attacks.)
					
</p>
<p>
						In addition, operation with limited amounts of routing state (such as routing tables and neighbor lists)
						SHOULD be maintained since some typical memory sizes preclude storing
						state of a large number of nodes. For instance, industrial monitoring applications
						may need to support at maximum 20 hops <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-indus-routing-reqs'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;indus&#8209;routing&#8209;reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Networks, D., Thubert, P., Dwars, S., and T. Phinney, &ldquo;Industrial Routing Requirements in Low Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.

						Small networks can be designed to support a smaller number of hops.
						While the need for this is highly dependent on the network architecture,
					        there should be at least one mode of operation that can
						function with 32 forwarding entries or less.

				    [R02] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD cause minimal power

				    [R13] A 6LoWPAN routing protocol SHOULD support various traffic patterns:

						6LoWPANs often have point-to-multipoint or multipoint-to-point

Support of Security</h3>

<p>
					The routing requirement described in this subsection allows secure
					transmission of routing messages. Solutions may take into account the
					specific features of IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layers.
				
</p>
<p> 
				    [R14] 6LoWPAN protocols SHOULD support secure delivery of control messages.
				    A minimal security level can be achieved by utilizing the AES-based mechanism
					provided by IEEE 802.15.4.
				
</p>
<p>
				</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
						Security threats within LoWPANs may be different from existing
						threat models in ad-hoc network environments.  Neighbor Discovery
						in IEEE 802.15.4 links may be susceptible to threats as listed in
						RFC3756 <a class='info' href='#RFC3756'>[RFC3756]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nikander, P., Kempf, J., and E. Nordmark, &ldquo;IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) Trust Models and Threats,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>.  Bootstrapping may also impose additional threats.
						Security is also very important for designing robust routing
						protocols, but it should not cause significant transmission
						overhead. While there are applications which require very high security,
						such as in traffic control, other applications are less easily harmed by
						wrong node behavior, such as a home entertainment system.
					
</p>
<p>
						The IEEE 802.15.4 MAC provides an AES-based security mechanism. Routing
						protocols need to define how this mechanism can be used to obtain
						the intended security, either for the routing protocol
            alone or in conjunction with the security used for the data. Byte overhead of the mechanism, which depends
						on the security services selected, must be considered. In the worst
						case in terms of overhead, the mechanism consumes 21 bytes of MAC
						payload.
					
</p>
<p> 
						IEEE 802.15.4 does not specify protection for acknowledgement frames.
						Since the sequence numbers of data frames are sent in the clear,
						an adversary can forge an acknowledgement for each data frame.
						This weakness can be combined with targeted jamming to prevent delivery of
						selected packets. In consequence, IEEE 802.15.4 acknowledgements cannot be relied upon.
						In applications that require high security, the routing protocol must not exploit
						feedback from acknowledgements (e.g. to keep track of neighbor connectivity, see [R16]).

Support of Mesh-under Forwarding</h3>

<p> 
				 One LoWPAN may be built as one IPv6 link.  In this case, Mesh Under
				 forwarding/routing mechanisms must be supported.  The routing requirements
				 described in this subsection allow optimization and correct operation
				 of routing solutions taking into account the specific features of the mesh-under configuration.
				
</p>
<p>
				   [R15] When a routing protocol operates in 6LoWPAN's adaptation layer,
					routing tables and neighbor lists MUST support 16-bit short and
					64-bit extended addresses.
				
</p>
<p>
					[R16] In order to perform discovery and maintenance of
          neighbors (i.e., neighborhood discovery as opposed to
          ND-style neighbor discovery), LoWPAN Nodes SHOULD avoid
          sending separate "Hello" messages.
					Instead, link-layer mechanisms (such as
					acknowledgments) MAY be utilized to keep track of
					active neighbors.
				
</p>
<p>
   				</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
						Reception of an acknowledgement after a frame transmission may render
						unnecessary the transmission of explicit Hello messages, for example.
						
						In a more general view, any frame received by a node may be used as an input
						to evaluate the connectivity between the sender and receiver of that frame.
					
</p>
</blockquote><p>
        
</p>
<p>
					[R17] In case there are one or more nodes allocated for the
					specific role of local management, such a management node MAY take the
          role of keeping track of nodes within the area of the LoWPAN
          it takes responsibility for.
