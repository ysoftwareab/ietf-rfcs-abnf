1.  Introduction

   The telecommunications sector is experiencing a major revolution that
   will shape the way networks and services are designed and deployed
   for the next decade.  We are witnessing an explosion in the number of
   applications and services demanded by users, which are now really
   capable of accessing them on the move.  In order to cope with such a
   demand, some network operators are looking at the cloud computing
   paradigm, which enables a potential reduction of the overall costs by
   outsourcing communication services from specific hardware in the
   operator's core to server farms scattered in datacenters.  These
   services have different characteristics if compared with conventional
   IT services that have to be taken into account in this cloudification
   process.  Also the transport network is affected in that it is
   evolving to a more sophisticated form of IP architecture with trends
   like separation of control and data plane traffic, and more fine-
   grained forwarding of packets (beyond looking at the destination IP
   address) in the network to fulfill new business and service goals.

   Virtualization of functions also provides operators with tools to
   deploy new services much faster, as compared to the traditional use
   of monolithic and tightly integrated dedicated machinery.  As a
   natural next step, mobile network operators need to re-think how to
   evolve their existing network infrastructures and how to deploy new
   ones to address the challenges posed by the increasing customers'
   demands, as well as by the huge competition among operators.  All
   these changes are triggering the need for a modification in the way
   operators and infrastructure providers operate their networks, as
   they need to significantly reduce the costs incurred in deploying a
   new service and operating it.  Some of the mechanisms that are being
   considered and already adopted by operators include: sharing of
   network infrastructure to reduce costs, virtualization of core
   servers running in data centers as a way of supporting their load-

   aware elastic dimensioning, and dynamic energy policies to reduce the
   monthly electricity bill.  However, this has proved to be tough to
   put in practice, and not enough.  Indeed, it is not easy to deploy
   new mechanisms in a running operational network due to the high
   dependency on proprietary (and sometime obscure) protocols and
   interfaces, which are complex to manage and often require configuring
   multiple devices in a decentralized way.

   Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking
   (SDN) are changing the way the telecommunications sector will deploy,
   extend and operate their networks.

   A challenge not yet sufficiently addressed is the multi-domain case,
   where the infrastructure (considered as network, computing and
   storage resources), or even some of the necessary network functions,
   are provided by different providers each of them constituting a
   separate administrative domain.

   Innovative solutions have to be defined for multi-domain services
   provisioned in an automated and on-demand manner in order to
   accommodate future services.  Such solutions not only should permit
   programmability, flexibility and automation, but also should allow
   for agile contracting, invoking and settling of services reducing
   significantly the time for provision (moving from the current figure
   of 90 days to 90 minutes as a goal) [Project_5GEx_Whitepaper].

2.  Terminology

   The following terms used in this document are defined by the ETSI NVF
   ISG, and the ONF and the IETF:

      NFV Infrastructure (NFVI): totality of all hardware and software
      components which build up the environment in which VNFs are
      deployed

      NFV Management and Orchestration (NFV-MANO): functions
      collectively provided by NFVO, VNFM, and VIM.

      NFV Orchestrator (NFVO): functional block that manages the Network
      Service (NS) lifecycle and coordinates the management of NS
      lifecycle, VNF lifecycle (supported by the VNFM) and NFVI
      resources (supported by the VIM) to ensure an optimized allocation
      of the necessary resources and connectivity.

      OpenFlow protocol (OFP): allowing vendor independent programming
      of control functions in network nodes.

Internet-Draft     Multi-domain Network Virtualization        March 2016


      Service Function Chain (SFC): for a given service, the abstracted
      view of the required service functions and the order in which they
      are to be applied.  This is somehow equivalent to the Network
      Function Forwarding Graph (NF-FG) at ETSI.

      Service Function Path (SFP): the selection of specific service
      function instances on specific network nodes to form a service
      graph through which an SFC is instantiated.

      Virtualized Infrastructure Manager (VIM): functional block that is
      responsible for controlling and managing the NFVI compute, storage
      and network resources, usually within one operator's
      Infrastructure Domain.

      Virtualized Network Function (VNF): implementation of a Network
      Function that can be deployed on a Network Function Virtualisation
      Infrastructure (NFVI).

      Virtualized Network Function Manager (VNFM): functional block that
      is responsible for the lifecycle management of VNF.

3.  Background: the ETSI NFV architecture

   The ETSI ISG NFV is a working group which, since 2012, aims to evolve
   quasi-standard IT virtualization technology to consolidate many
   network equipment types into industry standard high volume servers,
   switches, and storage.  It enables implementing network functions in
   software that can run on a range of industry standard server hardware
   and can be moved to, or loaded in, various locations in the network
   as required, without the need to install new equipment.  To date,
   ETSI NFV is by far the most accepted NFV reference framework and
   architectural footprint [etsi_nvf_whitepaper].  The ETSI NFV
   framework architecture framework is composed of three domains
   (Figure 1):

   o  Virtualized Network Function, running over the NFVI.

   o  NFV Infrastructure (NFVI), including the diversity of physical
      resources and how these can be virtualized.  NFVI supports the
      execution of the VNFs.

   o  NFV Management and Orchestration, which covers the orchestration
      and life-cycle management of physical and/or software resources
      that support the infrastructure virtualization, and the life-cycle
      management of VNFs.  NFV Management and Orchestration focuses on
      all virtualization specific management tasks necessary in the NFV
      framework.

4.  Multidomain problem statement

   Complex network services enabled by NFV could be deployed leveraging
   on different infrastructure environments pertaining to distinct
   administrative domains, that is, operated and managed by distinct
   providers.

   It is then necessary to explore mechanisms for providing access to
   that multiple domain environments in a common, standardized way, in
   order to facilitate portability among NFVI PoPs independently of the
   owner of such infrastructure.

   Common service catalog, normalized ways of requesting services,
   negotiation capabilities for ensuring and agreeing service levels,
   etc. are topics that have to be analyzed for truly allowing
   multidomain NFV services.

5.  Multi-domain architectural approaches

   Different levels of relationship could be observed among customers
   demanding NFV-based services and the providers offering those
   capabilities.

   From the customer perspective, the customer could be aware or not of
   the existence of different underlying administrative domains
   supporting NFV-based services.  If the customer is aware of that
   multi-domain situation, the customer would need to support some
   features for (functionally) splitting the intended NFV-based service
   among the multiple domains, ensuring proper coordination,
   troubleshooting and operation between the distinct domains.

   If the customer is unaware of the underlying multi-domain situation,
   some of the providers would need to play the role of coordinator
   between domains, in order to present towards the customer a unified
   view of the services, as if it was served from one single provider.

   Two possible approached for this last case are described in the
   following sub-sections.

5.1.  Hierarchical

   In the hierarchical approach, the provider facing the customer as a
   single entry point for the service request will maintain
   relationships with the other providers in order to complete the
   service.  The Entry-Point Provider (EPP) will produce the service
   split among parties, ensuring adequate levels of coordination to
   offer the service as provided by a single domain to the customer.

   This EPP could even not having any NFV infrastructure, just acting as
   a trading agent, interacting with the rest of providers which
   actually have NFVIs available for the service.

5.2.  Cascading

   In the cascading approach the EPP partially satisfies the service
   request but complements the service by using resources external to
   its own domain.  The provider will trade such resources with some
   other provider's offering capabilities at disposal of external
   domains.  It could be the case that those capabilities could even be
   owned by a third provider, but this is not visible for the first

   provider.  The second provider will be in charge of providing the
   adequate levels of operation to the first providers, either using
   resources of the second or third provider.  In this way, the control
   and management is cascaded among parties.
