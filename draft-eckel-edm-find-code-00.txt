1.  Introduction

   Code related to existing IETF standards and ongoing standardization
   efforts may exist and be publicly accessible in many places.  One
   common place is GitHub (https://github.com/), but there are many
   others.  The relationship of the code to corresponding IETF standards
   efforts may be direct, as in the case of a client or server that
   supports protocol defined by an Internet-Draft (I-D)
   (https://www.ietf.org/standards/ids/).  It may be indirect, as in a
   utility that helps analyze network traffic corresponding to this same
   protocol.  The maturity and status of the code may vary considerably,
   including something written quickly as a proof of concept during a
   hackathon, a well established and supported implementation, or a
   legacy project no longer actively developed or maintained.  The code
   must be publicly available, and preferably open source, though other
   terms of use may exist as well.  In all cases, the code is
   potentially of interest and beneficial to people contributing to the
   definition, implementation, or deployment of an existing or evolving
   IETF standard.  This document provides a set of practices make it
   easier to identify and to find such code.

2.  Existing IETF Processes and Procedures

   The idea that code related to IETF standards is valuable is not new.
   Most IETF participants are familiar with the phrase "rough consensus
   and running code" from the IETF Tao (https://www.ietf.org/tao.html).
   The existence of multiple independently developed and interoperable
   implementations was explicitly required by [RFC1264] for internet
   standards on routing protocols.  Subsequent updates relaxed this
   requirement, but the value of running code is still appreciated, and
   several current RFCs define processes and procedures related to
   running code.

2.1.  Implementation Status

   A simple process that allows authors of I-Ds to record the status of
   known implementations by including an Implementation Status section
   is defined [RFC7942].  The goal of this section is to allow the read
   to assign due consideration to I-Ds that have the benefit of running
   code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation and
   feedback that make the protocols and corresponding documents more
   mature.  However, it is stated that the Implementation Status section
   should be removed from I-Ds before they are published as RFCs.  As a
   result, the value of the code is limited to that required to develop
   the standard, and the mechanism does not help find the code once the
   RFC is published.

2.2.  GitHub

   The IETF chartered the GitHub Integration and Tooling (GIT)
   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/git/about/) working group to
   establish and document practices and policies for use of GitHub by
   working groups for managing their work.  This resulted in [RFC8874],
   which provides a set of guidelines for working groups that choose to
   use GitHub for their work, and [RFC8875], which specifies a set of
   administrative processes and conventions for such working groups.
   Within the working group, the concept of work is limited to the
   development of I-Ds that may eventually become RFCs.  Any concept of
   code is limited to that which appears as text within these documents.
   In many cases, there is additional code that is closely associated
   with the documents but not contained within them.  This code may be
   of interest to the community of people contributing to the
   development of the documents or to the implementation or deployment
   of eventual standards defined by them.

2.3.  Hackathon

   The IETF Hackathon [I-D.ietf-shmoo-hackathon] encourages the IETF
   community to collaborate on running code related to existing and
   evolving Internet standards.  Each Hackathon has a wiki that provides
   a brief description of each project.  It is common for there to be
   one of more I-Ds or RFCs associated with each project, and for there
   to be one or more related code repositories.  These resources are
   often listed on the wiki, but they are documented and shared with
   project teams in other ways as well.  After the Hackathon, the wiki
   remains available, but the information within it is typically not
   updated or maintained.

3.  Proposal

   This section specifies a set of practices that use existing
   mechanisms to associate code with an I-D or RFC.  Following these
   practices makes it easier for others working with the I-D or RFC to
   find such code.

3.1.  Datatracker

   The IETF Datatracker (https://datatracker.ietf.org/) supports the
   association of "Additional Resources" with a "Document" (e.g., an I-D
   or RFC) or a "Group" (e.g., working group
   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/), research group
   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/rg/)).  An "Additional Resource" can
   be, among others things, a GitHub Organization
   (https://docs.github.com/en/organizations) or a GitHub Repository
   (https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-
   github/quickstart/create-a-repo#create-a-repository).

   It is recommended that this Datatracker mechanism be used to
   associate an appropriate GitHub organization and repository with an
   I-D.  Ideally these are setup per the guidelines in [RFC8874] and
   [RFC8875].  In the event the working group or research group is not
   using GitHub, or the I-D has not yet been adopted by the group,
   another GitHub organization or repository may be used instead.  A
   GitHub organization is associated with the I-D using the "github_org"
   tag.  A GitHub repository is associated with the I-D using the
   "github_repo" tag.

3.2.  GitHub Repository

   A GitHub repository should be setup for an I-D as outlined in
   Section 3.2 of RFC 8874 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/
   rfc8874.html#section-3.2).  The i-d-template
   (https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template) can be used to get
   started.  It provides useful features, including integration with the
   Datatracker.  The resulting repository should be associated with the
   I-D using the Datatracker "github_repo" tag.  This should be done
   even if GitHub is not to be used to collaborate on the I-D.

   A GitHub repository typically exists within a GitHub organization.
   This is not always the case (e.g., a repository in a personal GitHub
   account), and even when it is, the GitHub organization may not be
   appropriate to associated with the I-D.  In the event there is an
   appropriate GitHub organization, it should be associated with the I-D
   using the Datatracker "github_org" tag.

3.3.  README

   The GitHub repository associated with the I-D should include a README
   (https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-
   repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/about-readmes).  The
   README should include information about the repository, whether or
   not it is being used to collaborate on the I-D, and any code
   associated with the I-D.  The latter may be achieved by including

   direct links to such code or by including links to other resources
   that include information about such code.  These resources may be a
   file, folder, or wiki (https://docs.github.com/en/communities/)
   within the GitHub repository or the GitHub organization associated
   with the I-D.  The QUIC WG's Implementations wiki
   (https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/wiki/Implementations) is an
   example.

3.4.  Implementation Status

   An Implementation Status section, as defined [RFC7942], should be
   added to an I-D.  It should include any GitHub organization or GitHub
   repository associated with the I-D.

3.5.  Errata

   In the event an I-D becomes an RFC, people looking for code are less
   likely to reference the Datatracker, and the Implementation Status
   section is likely to have been removed.  Any GitHub organization or
   GitHub repository associated with the RFC should be made available as
   inline errata (https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/edm/
   ku3cd5xTla7tbtohVYWWW7-XTIg/).

4.  Implementation Status

   The practices proposed in this document are followed by draft-ietf-
   shmoo-hackathon (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-shmoo-
   hackathon/).

5.  Security Considerations

   TBD.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

   respectively.

   Spencer Dawkins pointed out the RFC editor's ability to inline errata
   (https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/edm/

   be done to point to code.

   Adam Roach played in important role in enabling the RFC editor's
   ability to inline errata (https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/edm/

   Mark Nottingham provided an illustrative examples of how the QUIC
   (https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/wiki/Implementations) working
   group uses wiki pages to track early implementations.
