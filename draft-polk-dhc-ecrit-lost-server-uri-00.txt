1.  Introduction

   In IP communications, destination addressing can be to an IP address
   directly, or to a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), where the 
   service at the URI is resolved to a destination IP address by the 
   source system or along the path.  In Voice over IP communications, 
   the destination IP address is infrequently used by the calling 
   device; rather, a URI is used.  The burden is on call servers along 
   the path to resolve this URI to IP address to determine where to 
   route the packet(s) to.  

   Understanding the decomposed nature of voice communications, quite 
   pronounced with peer-to-peer protocols potentially having servers 
   100s and 1000s of miles away from the calling device, call 
   signaling at a higher layer may lack the local knowledge to 
   appropriately provide the client with what is necessary to make a 
   local emergency call.  In emergency communications, the act of 
   calling for help is a highly localized event, requiring knowledge of
   where the caller is.  The destination of that emergency call will 
   also be local in nature.  

   This document defines a new Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 
   (DHC) Option [RFC2131] to deliver a specific type of URI requested 
   by a client of a server, and transmitted unrequested from a server
   to a client.  The type of URI is that of a Location-to-Service 
   Translation (LoST) Protocol mapping server [ID-LOST].  

   A Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) is an emergency call center; 
   most likely the first point of contact when a caller dials 911 or 
   112 (or another locally significant number) for emergency help.  
   These numbers are not routable, therefore the service within a given
   jurisdiction cannot be accessed from outside a local area.  Each 
   PSAP will have a unique URI.  At issue is how an IP device conveys

Internet-Draft       DHC Option for LoST Server URI          June 2006

   where it is to get to its appropriate PSAP.  

   A local configuration network can provide a LoST server URI to a 
   client to request map of that client's location to a PSAP URI.

   LoST mapping servers will likely have the necessary ability 
   (horsepower, memory, database, etc) to increase granularity within 
   the region's access networks to provide exactly which PSAP a caller
   needs to contact, given their location.

   In a Voice over IP system, an emergency URI is an essential part of 
   configuration information necessary for usage by an client for the 
   particular purpose of contacting what is at that local URI.  Having 
   access to a mapping server that can provide this URI to a client is 
   critical.

   Using SIP [RFC3261] as the application layer call message flow 
   example protocol, emergency calling wants the following message flow
   to occur when Alice is in trouble:

       Alice                        PSAP

            [M1] INVITE (sos & location)
          -------------------------->

            [M2] 200 OK
          <--------------------------

            [M3] ACK
          -------------------------->

           Media Session Established
          <=========================>

      Figure 1. Basic Emergency Message Flow

   SIP uses an INVITE message as its initial call set-up message.  All 
   relevant addressing and other information can be in this one 
   message, including the destination URI (address) for Alice's 
   appropriate PSAP, given where she is.  Where Alice's voice device, 
   called a user agent (UA) by SIP, learned the destination URI is what
   this document solves for some network topologies.

   In Figure 1., Message-1 contains Alice's location, defined in 
   [ID-SIP-LOC], perhaps learned from the UA requesting DHC Option 123 
   [RFC3825] or the Option that results from [ID-CIVIC] at boot time.  
   This location information, which is vital to an emergency call 
   because it informs the PSAP where to send first responders, is 
   encoded inside the INVITE's message body in the form of an XML 
   document PIDF-LO   [RFC4119].  The destination URI of this message 
   can be learned by the UA requesting a DHCP server do the mapping 
   query in certain circumstances or, the UA performing a LoST

   [ID-LoST] mapping request itself.  This document defines how the 
   client learns the URI of its LoST mapping server.  

   Section 2 provides an example message flow of what this document 
   achieves.  Section 3 shows the DHC Relay Option Format.  Section 3.1
   discusses the rules of usage of this Option. Section 4 is the IANA 
   Considerations section of this DHCP Option.  


1.1  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].

1.2  Terms, Acronyms and Definitions

   The following terms and acronyms are used within this document:

   Emergency Services Routing Proxy - a special instance of a SIP Proxy
      that understands emergency routing to a PSAP based on the 
      location of the caller

   ESRP - Emergency Services Routing Proxy

   Location-to-Service Translation - A mapping function that takes a 
      given location and determines the PSAP URI for a user who calls 
      from that location.

   LoST - Location-to-Service Translation

   PSAP - Public Safety Answering Point

   Public Safety Answering Point - the emergency response call center 
      talking the local emergency calls from people in distress.  This 
      facility can be logical, and can transfer (reroute) any request 
      sent to it to another facility deemed more appropriate to receive
      the request.


2. Solution Message Flow Example

   Figure 2. what can occur prior to the flow in Figure 1., showing 
   where Alice's client learns the essential configuration information 
   to place an emergency call. Omitted is SIP registration step, which 
   may or may not be necessary, depending on location policy.

   In Message-3, Alice's client requests both Location and her LoST 
   server URI.  The server acquires Alice's location (not explained 
   here) and looks up the appropriate LoST mapping server, and 
   generates Message-4.  Message-5 is the LoST query to a Mapping 
   server for the appropriate PSAP SIP(S)-URI.  Message-6 is the

     [M3] DHCP REQUEST or INFORM (Location, LoST-URI)
     ---------------->
     [M4] DHCP ACK (contains location & LoST-URI)
     <----------------

     [M5] LoST Query (contains Location)
     ------------------------------------->
     [M6] LoST Response (contains PSAP-URI)
     <-------------------------------------

           Emergency Call set-up initiated to LoST supplied URI
     ----------..........----------........-------........------>

   Figure 2. Location-to-URI Mapping Requested by DHCP Server

   Using this LoST URI, a client can contact the LoST server when a 
   user calls for emergency help, ensuring the PSAP URI retrieved is 
   the freshest it can be for the emergency call.  The details of 
   emergency calling are out of scope for this Option, and are included
   here to give applicability and justification to the Option.


3.  DHC Relay Option Format

   The format for this Option is as follows:

     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |   Code XXX    |    Length     |      URI of LoST Server       +
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                    URI of LoST Server (cont'd)                +
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |   URI of LoST Server (cont'd to a maximum of 253 bytes)       |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                 Figure 1. The URI Option Format

   Code =        The IANA Assigned Option number

   Length =      one octet providing a variable length value of the 
                 number of bytes in the Option, including this length 
                 field



Polk                       Expires Dec, 2006                  [Page 5]
Internet-Draft       DHC Option for LoST Server URI          June 2006

   URI         = This is a variable length field containing the URI 
                 being transmitted, to a maximum of 253 bytes in length


3.1  Rules of Usage

   The following are the rules of usage of this DHCP Option:

   - a LoST mapping server URI MUST NOT have a Length field of more 
     than 253 (bytes), complying with [RFC2131]

   - Clients making a request for one this URI, using a [REQUEST] 
     message, will send this message to the Server with URI length 
     field set to zero

   - The URI schema of the LoST URI has not been decided yet, as the 
     protocol transport is still up in the air.  A future version of 
     this document will specify this schema.


4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned a DHCP option code of [XXX] for the LoST Mapping 
   Server URI option defined in this document.


5.  Security Considerations

   Where critical decisions might be based on the value of this URI
   option, DHCP authentication in [RFC3118] SHOULD be used to protect 
   the integrity of the DHCP options.

   Since there is no privacy protection for DHCP messages, an
   eavesdropper who can monitor the link between the client and
   destination DHCP server to capture any URIs in transit.

   When implementing a DHC server that will serve clients across an
   uncontrolled network, one should consider the potential security
   risks.
