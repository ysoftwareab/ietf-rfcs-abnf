Internet-Draft DSR Extensions for the Resolution of Cached December 2016

Abstract

   In DSR, a node can generate a route reply in response to a received
   route request if it has a fresh route to the destination in its
   route cache. However, this can incur the cached route reply problem
   and DSR just tries to mitigate this problem by reducing the
   possibility of cached route reply collisions. This document
   describes how DSR can be extended for the resolution of the cached
   route reply problem.

Internet-Draft DSR Extensions for the Resolution of Cached December 2016


1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   
2.  Introduction

   The DSR protocol [1] works based on the source routing mechanism
   and support multiple routes between a source and destination node
   pair by maintaining several routes in the route cache at the source.
   However, in DSR, the route reply storm problem can happen
   because of route replies generated by intermediate nodes with fresh
   routes to the destination in their own route caches (i.e., cached
   route replies). DSR tries to solve this route reply storm problem
   by reducing the possibility of route reply collisions with adding
   a short jitter delay before the broadcast of a route reply.
   However, DSR does not try to resolve the cause of the route reply
   storm problem.

   The main reason of the route reply storm is uncontrolled
   generation of route replies at intermediate nodes, i.e., cached
   route replies. Therefore, a mechanism to control the generation of
   route replies at intermediate nodes is required for the effective
   operation of DSR. However,for the support of multipath routing,
   too tight restriction (control) on route reply generation may not be
   desirable. Therefore, when controlling the generation of route
   replies, both of these aspects need to be considered. In this draft,
   we describe how DSR Options header has to be extended to support
   the control of generation route replies.


3.  Extensions on DSR Options Header

   In DSR, there is no way to control the generation of cached route
   replies, so a C (Cached route reply) big is inserted in the DSR
   Route Request option, To do that, the size of the Identification
   field is reduced to 14 bits from 16 bits. This makes the
   Acknowledgement Request option and the Acknowledgement option
   modified because those two options have the Identification field.


3.1 Extensions on DSR Route Request Option

   The Route Request option in the DSR Options header is extended as
   follows:

IP fields: the same as described in [2]

Route Request fields: the same as described in [2] except for the
                      Identification field, the C bit and the
                      Resv field

   Identification
      The definition of this field is the same as that in [2].
      Only the size of thie field is reduced to 12 bits.

   C
      C bit is used to indicate whether cached route replies are
      allowed or not. C bit is set to 1 if the cached route reply
      is allowed. The intermediate nodes can generate cached route
      replies only when the C bit of the received Route Request option
      is 1. Otherwise, only the destination node can generate
      route replies.

   Resv
      The reserved field for further extensions on DSR Route Request
      option.


3.2 Extensions on DSR Acknowledgement Request Option

   The Acknowledgement Request option in the DSR Options header is
   extended as follows:
