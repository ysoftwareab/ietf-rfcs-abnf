2. Introduction

   The XML Encryption Syntax and Processing document [XENC] specifies a
   process for encrypting data and representing the result in XML. The
   data may be arbitrary data (including an XML document), an XML
   element, or XML element content. The result of encrypting data is an
   XML Encryption element which contains or references the cipher data.

   The application/xenc+xml media type allows XENC applications to
   identify XENC documents for processing. Additionally it allows
   applications cognizant of this media-type (even if they are not XENC
   implementations) to note that the media type of the decrypted
   (original) object might a type other than XML.

   This media-type is only used for documents in which the XENC
   EncyptedData and EncryptedKey element types appear as the root element
   of the XML document. XML documents which contain XENC element types in
   places other than the root element can be described using facilities
   such as [XML-schema] or [StLaurent].

3. application/xenc+xml Registration

   This is a media type registration as defined in Multipurpose Internet
   Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Four: Registration Procedures [MIME-REG]

   MIME media type name: application

   MIME subtype name: xenc+xml

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset

     Same as charset parameter of application/xml as specified in RFC
     3023 [XML-MT] or the most recent specification that supersedes it.

   Encoding considerations:

     Same as charset parameter of application/xml as specified in RFC
     3023 [XML-MT] or the most recent specification that supersedes it.

   Security considerations:

     Security considerations include many of those described in the


Reagle, J.                 Expires October 2002                 [Page 2] 

Internet-Draft           XML Encryption Media-Type              June 2002 


     Security Considerations of [XENC].

   Interoperability considerations: none

   Published specification: [XENC].

   Applications which use this media type:

     XENC is device-, platform-, and vendor-neutral and is supported by
     a range of Web applications.

   Additional Information:

     Magic number(s): none

     Although no byte sequences can be counted on to consistently
     identify XENC documents, they will be XML documents in which the
     root element's QName's LocalPart is 'EncryptedData' with an
     associated namespace name of 'http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#'.
     The application/xenc+xml type name MUST only be used for data
     objects in which the root element is from the XENC namespace.

     File extension(s): .xml

     Macintosh File Type Code(s): "TEXT"

   Person & email address to contact for further information:

     Joseph Reagle <reagle@w3.org>

     XENC Working Group <xml-encryption@w3.org>

   Intended usage: COMMON

   Author/Change controller:

     The XENC specification is a work product of the World Wide Web
     Consortium. The W3C and the W3C XENC Working Group have change
     control over the specification.
