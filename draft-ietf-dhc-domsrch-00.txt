1.0  Abstract

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [1] provides a
   framework for passing configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP
   network. This document defines a new option which is passed form the
   DHCP server to the DHCP Client to configure the domain search list
   which is used by the clients to resolve hostnames in the Domain Name
   System.

2.0 Introduction

   RFC 2132 allows the Domain Name option (option 15) and the Domain
   Name Server (option 6) to be passed  to the DHCP client. These
   options are usually used to configure resolv.conf file on most
   operating systems. This information is used to resolve names in the
   Domain Name System[]. This option allowes a list of domain names in
   the order of preference to be passed to the DHCP client such that the
   search directive can be specified for name resolution.

   Throughout this document, the words that are used to define the
   significance of the particular requirements are capitalized.  These
   words are:

      MUST

           This word or the adjective "REQUIRED" means that the item is
           an absolute requirement of this specification.

      MUST NOT

           This phrase means the item is an absolute prohibition of this
           specification.

      SHOULD

           This word or the adjective "RECOMMENDED" means that there may
           exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore
           this item, but the full implications should be understood and
           the case carefully weighed before choosing a different
           course.

      SHOULD NOT

           This phrase means that there may exist valid reasons in
           particular circumstances when the listed behavior is
           acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should
           be understood and the case carefully weighted before
           implementing any behavior described with this label.

      MAY

           This word or the adjective "OPTIONAL" means that this item is
           truly optional.  One vendor may choose to include the item
           because a particular marketplace requires it or because it
           enhances the product, for example, another vendor may omit
           the same item.

   This document also uses the following terms:

      o "DHCP client"

           DHCP client or "client" is an Internet host using DHCP to
           obtain configuration parameters such as a network address.

      o "DHCP server"

           A DHCP server of "server"is an Internet host that returns

INTERNET DRAFT                                                 July 1997


           configuration parameters to DHCP clients.


3.0  Domain Search Option Format

   The code for this option is TBD, and its minimum length is 2 bytes.

          Code     Len       Priority
           +-------+-------+-------+--------+---------+---------+--
           |  TBD  |   n   |  d1   |   0    |   d2    |    0    |
           +-------+-------+-------+--------+---------+---------+--

   where:
         d1 & d2 are domain names

4.0  DHCP Client Behavior

   If a DHCP client is given both a Domain Name Option and a Domain
   Search Option, the Domain Search Option  will take precedence.


5.0  Security Considerations

   DHCP currently provides no authentication or security mechanisms.
   Potential exposures to attack are discussed in section 7 of the DHCP
   protocol specification [1].
