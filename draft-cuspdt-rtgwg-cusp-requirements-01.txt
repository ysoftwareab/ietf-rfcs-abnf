1.  Introduction

   BNG is an Ethernet-centric IP edge router, and the aggregation point
   for the user traffic.  To provide centralized session management,
   flexible address allocation, high scalability for subscriber
   management capacity, and cost-efficient redundancy, the CU separated
   BNG is introduced [TR-384].  The CU separated Service Control Plane
   could be virtualized and centralized, which is responsible for user
   access authentication and setting forwarding entries to user planes.
   The routing control and forwarding plane, i.e. BNG user plane
   (local), could be distributed across the infrastructure.

   This document introduces the Control Plane and User Plane separated
   BNG architecture and modeling.  This document also defines the
   protocol requirements for Control Plane and User Plane Separated BNG
   (CUSP).

2.  Concept and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.1.  Terminology

   BNG: Broadband Network Gateway.  A broadband remote access server
   (BRAS, B-RAS or BBRAS) routes traffic to and from broadband remote
   access devices such as digital subscriber line access multiplexers
   (DSLAM) on an Internet service provider's (ISP) network.  BRAS can
   also be referred to as a Broadband Network Gateway (BNG).

   CP: Control Plane.  The CP is a user control management component
   which supports to manage UP's resources such as the user entry and
   user's QoS policy

   UP: User Plane.  UP is a network edge and user policy implementation
   component.  The traditional router's Control Plane and forwarding
   plane are both preserved on BNG devices in the form of a user plane.

                     Architecture of CU Separated BNG


   Briefly, a CU separated BNG is made up of a Control Plane (CP) and a
   set of User Planes (UPs) [TR-384],
   [I-D.cuspdt-rtgwg-cu-separation-bng-deployment].  The Control Plane
   is a user control management component which supports to manage UP's
   resources such as the user entry and user's QoS policy, for example,
   the access bandwidth and priority management.  This Control Plane
   could be virtualized and centralized.  The functional modules inside
   the BNG Service Control Plane can be implemented as VNFs and hosted
   in a NFVI.  The User Plane Management module in the BNG control plane
   centrally manages the distributed BNG user planes (e.g. load
   balancing), as well as the setup, deletion, update, and maintenance
   of channels between control planes and user planes [TR-384],
   [I-D.cuspdt-rtgwg-cu-separation-bng-deployment].  And the User Plane
   (UP) is a network edge and user policy implementation component.  It
   can support the forwarding plane functions on traditional BNG
   devices, such as traffic forwarding, QoS, and traffic statistics

   collection, and it can also support the control plane functions on
   traditional BNG devices, such as routing, multicast, etc [TR-384],
   [I-D.cuspdt-rtgwg-cu-separation-bng-deployment].

3.1.  Internal interfaces between the CP and UP

   To support the communication between the Control Plane and User
   Plane, several interfaces are involved.  Figure 2 illustrates the
   internal interfaces of CU Separated BNG.

                   +----------------------------------+

          Internal interfaces between the CP and UP of the BNG device

   Service interface: The CP and UP use this interface to establish
   VXLAN tunnels with each other and transmit PPPoE and IPoE packets
   over the VXLAN tunnels.

   Control interface: The CP uses this interface to deliver service
   entries, and the UP uses this interface to report service events to
   the CP.

   Management interface: The CP uses this interface to deliver
   configurations to the UP.  This interface runs NETCONF.

   The CUSP (Control plane and User plane Separated BNG protocol)
   defines the control interface, and specifies the communication
   between the centralized control plane and user planes.  This protocol
   should be designed to support establishing and maintaining a
   conversation between CP and UPs, and transporting the tables which
   specified in [draft-cuspdt-rtgwg-cu-separation-infor-model].

                  CU Separation BNG protocol usage


   As shown in above figure, when users access to the BNG network, the
   control plane solicits these users' information (such as user's ID,
   user's MAC, user's access methods, for example via PPPoE/IPoE),
   associates them with available bandwidth which are reported by User
   planes, and based on the service's requirement to generate a set of
   tables, which may include user's information, UP's IP segment, and
   QoS, etc.  Then the control plane can transmit these tables to the

Internet-Draft            Requirements for CUSP            February 2018


   User planes.  User planes receive these tables, parse them, match
   these rules, and then perform corresponding actions.

5.  Control Plane and User Plane Separation Protocol Requirements

   This section specifies some of the requirements that the CU
   separation protocol SHOULD support.

5.1.  Transmit information tables

   The Control Plane and User Plane Separation Protocol MUST allow the
   CP to send tables to each User Plane device.

      a) The current BNG service requires that the UP should support at
      least 2000 users being accessed every second.  And every user
      requires at least 2000 bytes.  To achieve high performance, the CU
      Separation protocol SHOULD be lightweight.

      b) CU separation protocol should support XML/binary data which
      serves as the encoding format.  It allows user information data to
      be read, saved, and manipulated with tools specific to XML/binary.

      c) In order to provide centralized session management, high
      scalability for subscriber management capacity, and cost-efficient
      redundancy, batching ability should be involved.  The CU
      Separation protocol should be able to group an ordered set of
      commands to a UP device.  Each such group of commands SHOULD be
      sent to the UP in as few messages as possible.  Furthermore, the
      protocol MUST support the ability to specify if a command group
      MUST have all-or-nothing semantics.

5.2.  Scalability

   The CU Separation protocol SHOULD be able to support at least
   hundreds of UP devices and tens of thousands of ports.  For example,
   the protocol field sizes corresponding to UP or port numbers SHALL be
   large enough to support the minimum required numbers.  This
   requirement does not relate to the performance of the system as the
   number of UPs or ports in the system grows.

5.3.  Message Priority

   The CU Separation protocol MUST provide a means to express the
   protocol message priorities.

Internet-Draft            Requirements for CUSP            February 2018


5.4.  Reliability

   Heartbeat is a periodic signal generated by hardware or software to
   indicate normal operation or to synchronize other parts of network
   system.

   In CU separation BNG, the heartbeat is sent between CP and UPs at a
   regular interval in the order of seconds.  If the CP/UP does not
   receive a heartbeat for a time--usually a few heartbeat intervals--
   the CP/UP that should have sent the heartbeat is assumed to have
   failed.

   The CU separation protocol should support some kind of heartbeat
   monitor mechanism.  And this mechanism should have ability to
   distinguish whether the interruption is an actual failure.  For
   example, in some scenarios (i.e.  CP/UP update, etc), the connection
   between the UP and CP need to be interrupted.  In this case, the
   interruption should not be reported.

5.5.  Support for Secure Communication

   As mentioned above, CP may send some information tables to the UP
   which may be critical to the network function (e.g, User Information,
   IPv4/IPv6 information) and may reflect the business information (e.g,
   QoS, service level agreements, etc).  Therefore, it MUST be supported
   to ensure the integrity of all CU Separation protocol messages and
   protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.

   And the CP Separation protocol should support multiple security
   mechanisms to satisfy various scenarios.  For example, when the
   special lines are implemented between the CP and UPs, the key chain
   SHOULD be supported.  And if some VPNs are deployed between the CP
   and UPS, the TLS SHOULD be supported.  In case of the CP and UPs
   cross several domains (i.e. cross third-party network), the IPsec
   SHOULD be supported.

5.6.  Version negotiation

   The CU separated BNG may consist of different vendors' devices.
   Since different vendors' device may implement different versions of
   protocol, therefore, the CU separation protocol should provide some
   mechanisms to perform the version negotiation.

   The version negotiation is the process that the CU separated BNG's
   Control-Plane uses to evaluate the protocol versions supported by
   both the control-plane and the user-plane devices.  Then a suitable
   protocol version is selected for communication in CUSP.  The process
   is a "negotiation" because it requires identifying the most recent

Internet-Draft            Requirements for CUSP            February 2018


   protocol version that is supported by both the control-plane and the
   user-plane devices.

5.7.  Capability Exchange

   The UP Capability Report displays the devices profile, service
   capability, and other assigned capabilities within the CU separated
   BNG.  The CU separation protocol should provide some mechanism to
   exchange the UP device's capability

5.8.  CP primary/backup capability

   A backup CP for disaster recovery is required for the CU separated
   BNG network.  And the CUSP should provide some mechanism to implement
   the backup CP:

      a) In some scenarios, there may be two CP devices both declaring
      the primary CP.  Thus the CUSP should support or associate with
      some mechanisms to determine which CP is the primary device.

      b) In the scenario of the primary CP down, the CUSP should support
      switching between primary and backup CP.

5.9.  Event Notification

   The CUSP protocol SHOULD be able to asynchronously notify the CP of
   events on the UP such as failures and changes in available resources
   and capabilities.  Some scenarios which may initiate the event
   notification list as follows.

      a) Sending response message: As mentioned above, the control plane
      solicits users' information, associates them with available
      bandwidth, and generates a set of tables based on the service's
      requirement.  Then the control plane transmits these tables to the
      conresponding User plane.  The UP should respond with an event
      notification to inform the CP that the tables are received.

      b) User trace: The user trace mechanism can support the Control
      Plane to trace and monitor the network status for users (for
      example the real-time bandwidth, etc) , debug the user's
      application.  Therefore, the UPs SHOULD be able to notify the CP
      with the User trace message.

      c) Sending statistics parameters: In CU separation BNG, the User-
      plane will report the traffic statistics parameters to the
      Control-plane, such as the ingress packets, ingress bytes, egress
      packets, egress bytes, etc.  These parameters can help to measure
      the BNG network performance.  Available network resources can be

      allocated basing on the statistics parameters by the BNG-CP.
      Therefore, the UPs SHOULD be able to notify the CP with statistics
      parameters.

      d) Report the result of User Detect: "User Detect" message will be
      send periodically to detect user dial-up and disconnect.  The UPs
      SHOULD be able to notify the CP with the result of User Detect.

5.10.  Query Statistics

   The CUSP protocol MUST provide a means for the CP to be able to query
   statistics (performance monitoring) from the UP.

6.  Security Considerations

   None.

7.  IANA Considerations

   None.
