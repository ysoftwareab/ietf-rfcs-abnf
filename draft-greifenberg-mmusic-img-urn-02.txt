Internet-Draft                   img-urn                   November 2006


1.  Introduction

   Internet Media Guides (IMGs) are used to encapsulate and communicate
   metadata about (ephemeral) contents available via arbitrary networks,
   e.g., TV and multimedia streams, downloadable contents, or other
   services.

   The scope and background of the work on Internet Media Guides have
   been described in the IMG requirements [9] and IMG framework [8]
   specifications.  Furthermore, [10] specifies a common encapsulation
   format for metadata transport.

   Identification of IMG metadata is needed by receivers to be able to
   handle incoming metadata; it is important to know, if newly received
   metadata is something completely new or if it updates metadata that
   is already known.  Therefore an identifier is included in the IMG
   transport envelope.

   This identifier must be persistent and location-independent in order
   to allow metadata to be moved or cached by different entities and
   still be recognizable as the same metadata.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14, RFC 2119 [1] and indicate requirement levels for compliant
   implementations.

   IMG specific terminology is defined [8].  In addition, the following
   term is defined:
   IMG resource:  A common name for a full or delta IMG, for an IMG
      fragment, or an IMG pointer encoded in some specific metadata
      format.  The IMG resource does not include a possible IMG envelope
      used for encapsulation.  An IMG resource is identified by an IMG
      URN using the namespace defined in this document and may be stored
      in one or more locations.

   Namespace ID:

      "img" requested

   Registration information:

      Registration version: 1; registration date: 2006-11-06

   Declared registrant of the namespace:

      Contact: Janico Greifenberg
      jgre@jgre.org

   Declaration of syntactic structure:

      The Namespace Specific String (NSS) has the following ABNF [3]
      specification:



  NSS            = ProviderId ":" DateId ":" IMGRootId  [":" FragmentId]
  ProviderId     = 1*(label ".") toplabel
  DateId         = CCYY MM DD
  IMGRootId      = 1*(alphanum / symbol / ("%" HEXDIG HEXDIG ))
  FragmentId     = 1*(alphanum / symbol / ":" / ("%" HEXDIG HEXDIG ))
  label          = alphanum / alphanum *[ alphanum / "-" ] alphanum
  toplabel       = ALPHA / ALPHA *[ alphanum / "-" ] alphanum
  CCYY           = 4(DIGIT)
  MM             = ( 0 DIGIT ) / ( "1" ( "0" "1" "2" ) )
  DD             = ( 0 DIGIT ) / ( ( "1" / "2" ) DIGIT ) / "30" / "31"
  alphanum       = ALPHA / DIGIT
  symbol         = "(" / ")" / "+" / "," / "-" / "." / "=" /
  "@" / ";" / "$" / "_" / "!" / "*" / "'"


      ProviderId is the IMG sender's or IMG transceiver's identifier.
      ProviderId MUST be an Internet domain name, and MUST be owned by
      the organization creating the IMG resource and allocating the URN
      to the resource, at the date identified by the DateId.
      DateId is a date in ISO 8601 Basic Format (CCYYMMDD), and MUST
      correspond to a day (starting 00:00 UTC) the organization
      allocating the URN owned the domain name specified in the
      ProviderId.  The organization MUST use the same date for all URNs
      it allocates.

      IMGRootId MUST be unique among all IMGRootIds emanating from the
      IMG sender or IMG transceiver identified by ProviderId and DateId.
      This identifier refers to a top-level entity in the data model
      used for IMG resources published by the organization identified by
      the ProviderID and DateID.  The data model and its semantics are
      defined by the organization.
      If an IMG sender assigns an identifier to a subset of metadata
      identified by an IMGRootId, it uses the same IMGRootId and a
      FragmentId.  The FragmentId MAY be an identifier corresponding to
      the structure of the metadata.  The sender or transceiver MUST
      assign FragmentIds that are unique among the FragmentIds with the
      same IMGRootId.

   Relevant ancillary documentation:

      None

   Identifier Uniqueness considerations:

      The combination of ProviderId and DateId serves to uniquely
      identify the organization providing the IMG sender or IMG
      transceiver allocating the URN.  That organization is responsible
      for ensuring the uniqueness of the IMGRootId and the FragmentId.

   Identifier Persistence considerations:

      URNs of this namespace may only be allocated by an organization
      that owns an Internet domain name.  The URN identifies a date on
      which the organization owned that domain name.  The combination of
      domain name and date will serve to unambiguously and persistently
      identify that organization.

   Process of identifier assignment:

      The organization identified by the ProviderId/DateId combination
      is responsible for assigning an IMGRootId that is unique among all
      IMGRootId it allocates.

   Process for identifier resolution:

      IMG identifiers can be resolved using either data included in the
      IMG envelope or an external RDS.
      The IMG transfer envelope includes the identifies of the metadata
      the envelope is associated with.  Furthermore, the envelope can
      include URLs that can be used to access the metadata the envelope
      refers to.  IMG receivers MAY use this information to resolve the
      URN.  Receivers should, however, be aware the the URLs may be
      outdated and do not point to the sought metadata.

      IMG senders MAY provide URN resolution using the Dynamic
      Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) (see [4], [5], [6], and [7]).
      If this mechanism is available, receivers can locate an
      authoritative server for information about the sender of the IMG
      identified by a given URN using the process specified in [7].

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

      The ProviderId is case-insensitive.  The remainder of the NSS
      shall be considered case-sensitive.  Otherwise the rules defined
      in [2] apply.

   Conformance with URN syntax:

      When using format-specific syntaxes for identifying fragments in
      the FragmentId portion of the URN, senders MUST translate any
      character that is outside the URN character set using the rules
      defined in [2].

   Validation mechanism:

      None additional to resolution specified.

   Scope:

      Global.


4.  Examples

   The following examples are representative of URNs in this namespace,
   but may not refer to actual IMG resources.


       urn:img:example.org:20051021:my-img-root
       urn:img:example.org:20051021:my-img-root:subset


5.  Namespace Considerations

   The IMG namespace allows names to be assigned in a distributed manner
   without central authority.  IMG senders can choose the identifier
   structure that best suits the needs of their application context.
   Furthermore, format-specific or application-specific fragment
   identifiers can be included in IMG URNs to allow subsets of metadata
   to be identified.

   Resolution can be done using either a distributed discovery system or

   a simple mapping that does not require any additional round-trips.
   This allows applications to use the mechanism best suited for their
   needs.


6.  Community Considerations

   The ability to assign unique identifiers for IMGs in a flexible
   manner without a central authority, allows IMG senders and IMG
   transceivers to be set up easily.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document includes a URN NID registration that is to be entered
   into the IANA registry of URN NIDs.


8.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.
