   assumptions on the link it is used over. The scheme should be able to

1. Introduction

   The purpose of this document is to outline requirements on a
   signaling compression scheme to be made in the ROHC WG, and
   assumptions on the link it is used over. The scheme should be able to
   compress/decompress messages from signaling protocols, such as
   SIP/SDP [SIP], [SDP].

   In wireless environments and especially in cellular systems, such as
   GSM/GPRS, there is a need to maximize the transport efficiency of
   data over the radio interface. The radio spectrum is rather expensive
   [CELL] and must be used carefully. Therefore the cellular systems
   must support a sufficient number of users to make them economical
   feasible. Thus, there is a limitation in the per user bandwidth.

   Compressing the headers of the IP-protocols used for carrying user
   data is one way to make more efficient use of the scarce radio
   resources [ROHC]. However, compression of the messages from signaling
   protocols, such as SIP/SDP, should also be considered to increase the
   radio resource usage even further. Compression will also improve the
   service quality, by reducing the user idle time, at e.g. call setup.
   When IP will be used end-to-end, new applications, such as streaming,
   will be brought to the cellular devices. This will introduce
   additional traffic in cellular systems. Compression of signaling

   messages, such as RTSP [RTSP], should also be considered to improve
   both the service availability and quality.
   New services with their corresponding signaling protocols make it
   reasonable to consider a scheme that is generic. The scheme should be
   generic in the meaning that the scheme efficiently can be applied to
   arbitrary protocols with certain characteristics, such as the ASCII
   based protocols SIP and RTSP, [APP].


2. Assumptions

   SIP/SDP messages are some of the messages that could be compressed by
   a signaling compression scheme. The statement in [GUIDE]:
   "Compression of SIP messages SHOULD be handled at lower layers, for
   example, using IP payload compression [9] or link layer compression"
   implies that signaling compression should be placed below the
   application layer.

   The use of the signaling compression scheme should be negotiated. In
   [ROHC-PPP], an option to negotiate the use of robust header
   compression (ROHC) on IP datagrams transmitted over the Point-to-
   Point Protocol [RFC1661] is described.
   It is out of the scope of this document to specify options to
   negotiate the use of signaling compression.

   When using IP to traverse voice data (VoIP) over wireless links, such
   as cellular links, there will be comparisons between the VoIP service
   and the existing circuit-switched voice service. Most likely capacity
   (users/cell) will be used in the comparisons. Using near the same
   bandwidth per user as for the circuit-switched voice service will
   most likely be preferred also for the VoIP service due to scarce
   radio resources. Therefore it is assumed that the same bandwidth used
   for the actual speech data is also used for the signaling ,when one
   is to compare different signaling compression approaches.

   Processor load and memory requirements are two essential issues with
   mobile handheld terminals, such as cellular phones. However, it is
   hard to predict both how complex a signaling compression scheme will
   become and also what memory and processor capacity handheld terminals
   will have in the future. Thus, no assumption on the capabilities of
   future terminals are made.


3. Requirements

   The requirements are divided into two parts. Section 3.1 sets general
   requirements concerning the Internet infrastructure, while section
   3.2 sets requirements on the scheme itself.

3.1. General requirements

   The compression must be transparent: when a message is compressed and
   then decompressed the result must be bitwise identical to the
   original message. The transparency must be maintained independently
   of the payload. This is to ensure that the compression scheme will
   not cause problems for any current or future part of the Internet
   infrastructure.

   The compression scheme must be able to coexist with the ROHC
   protocol. Compression of IP/UDP and IP/TCP should be inherited from
   existing profiles, like the existing ROHC profile for IP/UDP
   compression.

   Modifications to the protocols, which generates the messages that are
   to be compressed, must not be required for the compression scheme to
   work. This will simplify deployment of the compression scheme.

   Compression of arbitrary message streams must be supported. The
   compression scheme must not be limited to certain protocols, traffic
   patterns or sessions. This does not preclude optimization for certain
   streams.

   The compression scheme must be able to operate on unidirectional
   links, i.e. without explicit feedback messages from the decompressor.
   However, implementations on unidirectional links are expected to show
   a degraded performance compared to implementations on bi-directional
   links


3.2. Performance requirements

   The compression scheme must be able to operate under all expected
   link delay conditions.

   The compression scheme must be able to operate under all expected
   packet loss conditions.

   The compression scheme must be able to operate under all expected
   residual bit error conditions.

   The compression scheme should aim at minimizing transmission delay
   and maximizing the bitwise efficiency. Since there are no previously
   defined solutions for compression of application signaling protocols
   it is difficult to find a suitable benchmark.

   The total delay, including processing time of the compression scheme,
   must decrease when compression is applied compared to sending the
   packets uncompressed on the same channel bandwidth.






Hannu                                                           [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT  Signaling Compression req. & assumptions    June 7, 2001


   Error propagation must be minimized. Loss or damage to a single or
   several messages should not prevent compression and decompression of
   later messages.

   The compression scheme should be able to compress and decompress when
   there are reordered messages reaching the compressor. Reordering is
   frequent on the Internet, which implies that the compressor must be
   able to handle reordering.


4. Security considerations

   A protocol specified to meet these requirements must be able to cope
   with packets that has undergone security measures, such as
   encryption, without adding any security risks. This document by
   itself, however, does not add any security risks.


5. IANA considerations

   A protocol which meets these requirements will require the IANA to
   assign various numbers. This document by itself, however, does not
   require any IANA involvement.
