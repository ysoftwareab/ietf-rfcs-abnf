2 Abstract 

   Public wireless Internet access zones based on IEEE 802.11 [1] 
   wireless LAN technology are becoming common. However, many issues 
   are impeding further adoption of the technology by end-users, in 
   particular the inability or difficulty to roam between the networks 
   of different providers. This document aims to document these issues, 
   show how they are different from roaming in other contexts such as 
   dialup access to the Internet or GSM roaming, and how current 
   solutions do not fully address these issues. Future documents will 
   try to address these issues with practical solutions.

3 Introduction 

   Public wireless Internet access zones (also known as "hot spots"), 
   commonly based on IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN technology are becoming 
   common. However, many issues are impeding further adoption of the 
   technology by end-users, in particular the inability or difficulty 
   to roam between the networks of different providers. 

   The rest of this document is structured as follows. Section 6 gives 
   a brief description of the workings of public wireless Internet 
   access zones. Section 7 shows why roaming is so important in this 
   context, and how it is different from other roaming environments, 
   such as dialup Internet access or GSM roaming. Section 8 describes 
   current solutions used to address authentication and possibly 
   roaming. Section 9 describes the issues found in these setups and 
   other possible issues.

6 Public Wireless Internet access zones 

   Public wireless Internet access zones are locations equipped by 
   Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISPs) with appropriate 
   hardware so that any user with a device (such as a laptop or PDA) 
   and an appropriate network card can attach to the wireless network, 
   access the Internet, and use any application relying on it, such as 
   e-mail, WWW browsing, remote access to a corporate network (VPN), 
   etc. while present in the coverage area. 

   Currently, most such setups rely on the IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN 
   technology, which provides cheap and fast connections (up to several 
   megabits per second), and a reasonable coverage area. The technology 
   is also extensively used within corporate and home boundaries, which 
   allow the reuse of existing hardware and minimum reconfiguration. 

   Such an access zone usually consists of one or more access points 
   providing the interface between the wireless devices and the wired 
   network, and some form of access controller (which may be integrated 
   within an access point) which checks that the user is properly 
   authenticated and authorized, and may perform such functions as 
   accounting, online subscription, provide local information services, 
   etc. The whole setup is then connected to the public Internet. 

   In most cases, authentication and authorization is actually relayed 
   to some central server holding the database of authorized users. 
   When roaming between different providers is implemented, additional 
   relaying can occur until the appropriate server is reached. 

7 Roaming requirements 

   For the public WLAN access model to become widely accepted, it is 
   necessary to build up critical mass, by having very extensive 
   coverage, without the need for users to sign up with multiple 
   different providers. 

   This requires roaming, as can be found in Internet dialup access 
   (discussed at length in the works of the roamops working group [3, 
   4]) or GSM networks, but an important difference makes it even more 
   of a requirement: the limited coverage of WLAN networks. 

   Internet dialup relies on the existing PSTN (public switched 
   telephone network) infrastructure, which allows for access from 
   nearly any location in the world (even though it might come at a 
     

   Caron          Informational - Expires July 2002                 3

   cost). It is not uncommon in many countries to have "nationwide" 
   numbers which allow Internet access for the price of a local call 
   from anywhere in the country. This means that a single ISP 
   participating in the roaming system the user subscribes to is enough 
   for that whole country. 

   GSM networks have cells that can cover up to hundreds of square 
   kilometers, and often have regulatory requirements for widespread 
   coverage. Hence, here also, a single GSM operator in the country 
   having a roaming agreement with the home GSM network is often 
   enough. In the worst case, the number of GSM operators in a country 
   is anyway limited to a very small number, usually a handful at most. 

   In comparison, a WLAN cell coverage radius is only a few hundred 
   meters. For this reason, WLAN coverage by any given operator remains 
   limited, and a much larger number of operators of all sizes (from 
   one access point to several thousand or more) will be required to 
   get any decent coverage and reach critical mass. 

7.1 Transparent roaming 

   Like for Internet dialup or GSM roaming, it is felt necessary that 
   authentication of users roaming to a public WLAN should be 
   transparent, i.e. does not require any manual action from the user, 
   or the use of a specific application. 

   The first point is that no specific reconfiguration should be needed 
   when roaming, not only from one public WLAN to another, but also 
   from a private WLAN (at home or at work) to a public one, and vice 
   versa. 

   It is also important to make sure the public WLAN can be used for 
   any IP-based service, including e-mail, VoIP, corporate VPN access, 
   etc. without requiring prior launch of a web browser, for instance, 
   which might not even be implemented on the specific device being 
   used (such as a VoIP phone). 

7.2 Security 

   Due to the very nature of wireless technology, authentication 
   exchanges must be protected against eavesdropping, which includes 
   capture of clear-text passwords, but also offline dictionary attacks 
   against encrypted credentials. 

   Given the wide number of WISPs of all sizes that will be used, it is 
   difficult to ascertain a trust relationship with every one of them. 
   For this reason, it is imperative that credentials be protected end-
   to-end, i.e. between the client and its home authentication server. 


     

   Caron          Informational - Expires July 2002                 4 
   INTERNET-DRAFT Public Wireless LAN Roaming Issues     February 2002 

    

   WLANs also allow the easy set up of "rogue" access points (a 
   problematic which does not exist in the dialup or GSM world), that 
   could attempt to act like a legitimate access point to try to 
   capture credentials. This again requires end-to-end protection of 
   login information, as well as means for the user to be sure that the 
   access point has access to its home server (mutual authentication). 

   Due to the possible lack of trust, and the probability that billing 
   will be at least in part duration based, it is also important that 
   home authentication servers (and indirectly users) can be sure that 
   visited networks cannot "cheat" on accounting by extending session 
   durations beyond their real lifetime. For this reason, it must be 
   possible for home servers to periodically re-authenticate roaming 
   users. 

   Conversely, it is also important for WISPs to make sure they will be 
   paid for the services provided, and hence have non-repudiation 
   mechanisms in place. This is detailed in section 7.4. 

   Another problem is the ability for another user to eavesdrop on a 
   legitimate user connection, take note of MAC and IP addresses, and 
   take its place as soon as the previous user left. This should be 
   addressed by some kind of local and/or end-to-end periodic re-
   authentication. 

7.3 Scalability 

   Given the very high number of WISPs that will be needed to get 
   decent coverage, and the need for global roaming, the roaming system 
   must be highly scalable. It is also doubtful - and undesirable - 
   that one single organization (roaming broker) will be able to build 
   relationships will all actors in the market, and handle them 
   efficiently. 

   It this thus necessary to envision an "open" roaming model, which 
   would allow for more complex chains of roaming intermediaries 
   between a network operator and a home authentication server, much 
   like Internet routing can go through a complex path through multiple 
   ISPs with various peering and transit relationships. 

   Exactly like in the Internet where global connectivity is a 
   requirement, it is very important that this open model ensure that 
   roaming can be global, and that there is always a path between any 
   network operator and any authentication server. 

7.4 Cost transport and accounting 

   Due to the requirements for a scalable and open roaming model, and 
   given the diversity of the cost structures of various WLAN 
   operators, it is desirable that any protocols used for carrying 
     

   Caron          Informational - Expires July 2002                 5 
   INTERNET-DRAFT Public Wireless LAN Roaming Issues     February 2002 

    

   authentication and authorization requests also carry cost 
   information. 

   This information must be described in a format that accounts for all 
   known billing scenarios (duration-based, volume-based, flat-fee, 
   pre-pay, initial and subsequent increments...), and can be easily 
   parsed and interpreted. The data may be modified along the way to 
   reflect roaming agreements (commissions of roaming brokers). 

   This information should also take into account different currencies, 
   and it is expected that roaming brokers will handle the conversion 
   between different currencies. 

   This cost information should be present in: 

   - authentication/authorization requests sent to the home server 
   (which might refuse "too expensive" connections based on the 
   requesting user's plan, for instance); 

   - in requests presented to the client during the authentication 
   process, so the user can approve (eventually in an automated 
   fashion) the costs that are presented; 

   - in positive authorization responses, with a means to certify that 
   the responding entity (home server or intermediate broker) agrees to 
   these costs (e.g. a digital signature); 

   - in interim and final accounting messages; 

   - in accounting message confirmations, with a non-repudiation 
   mechanisms such as a digital signature. 

   Note that the cost information and any digital signatures are only 
   local to the relationship between any two operators (or between the 
   end user and the home server, in the case of costs presented to the 
   end user), since intermediaries are able to modify these costs. 

   Digital signatures or equivalent mechanisms might also be needed on 
   the client acceptation of the costs presented. 

7.5 Private access 

   Given the fact that contrary to dialup and GSM technologies, WLAN 
   technologies are very often used in the home and office 
   environments, it is important that any solutions used for public 
   access be compatible with private access, without the need for 
   complex reconfiguration. 



     

   Caron          Informational - Expires July 2002                 6 
   INTERNET-DRAFT Public Wireless LAN Roaming Issues     February 2002 

    

   It might also be possible to encourage operators of home and 
   corporate WLAN networks to provide both private and public access, 
   and handle appropriately different classes of users. 

7.6 Other requirements 

   It is necessary that users that are not properly authenticated be 
   able to get access to some resources, such as free local resources, 
   servers providing service information and on-line subscription, help 
   or customer service information, etc. 

   This might be achieved by assigned such customers to a distinct VLAN 
   and/or IP network, or through filtering. 

   As much as possible, emphasis should be placed on solutions that can 
   be easily used, ported, and installed on a wide variety of 
   platforms, and not have too many dependencies on specific hardware, 
   firmware, drivers or operating systems. 

   It is also important that any solutions allow easy roaming to and 
   from other types of wireless (and maybe wired) networks, in 
   particular GPRS, due to the complementing nature of GPRS and WLAN 
   access technologies (wide coverage at low speed vs. limited coverage 
   at high speeds). 

7.7 Non-requirements 

   Once the client is properly authenticated and authorized, the 
   question of the protection of the data flowing to/from the client is 
   often raised, given the nature of wireless technology. 

   It is however felt by the author that any local encryption on the 
   wireless media only provides a false sense of security, since data 
   could be then easily captured by untrusted WISPs once it reaches the 
   wired network. 

   For this reason, use of end-to-end protection mechanisms, such as 
   IPsec (e.g. for VPN access to a corporate network) or SSL/TLS (for 
   web browsing or e-mail transfer) is a better solution that needs to 
   be encouraged. 

8 Existing setups 

   Most existing setups in public WLAN access zones (other than those 
   where access is free and no identification is required) use some 
   form of Web-based authentication and connection hijacking, described 
   below.

   INTERNET-DRAFT Public Wireless LAN Roaming Issues     February 2002 

    

8.1 Attaching to the wireless LAN 

   Access points are usually configured in the most "open" way 
   possible: there is no authentication and no encryption, thus any 
   user with a compatible device can attach to the WLAN and reach any 
   other devices connected to the network. 

8.2 Getting an IP address and other parameters 

   All configuration is usually done via DHCP [5], which allows the 
   user device to get a lease for an IP address, and other parameters 
   such as default gateway, DNS servers, etc. Here again, there is no 
   authentication, and any user can get this information. 

8.3 Filtering and connection hijacking 

   Until the user is properly authenticated and authorized, most 
   traffic is not authorized between WLAN users and the rest of the 
   global Internet. However, any attempt to reach a WWW server using 
   the HTTP protocol [6] over a TCP connection to the well-known port 
   for this protocol (port 80), is captured locally, and results in a 
   "redirect" towards a pre-defined target, usually a WWW server 
   providing an authentication interface, as defined below. 

   An exception is made so that any user can get access to "free" 
   resources, which include the WWW-based authentication server, and 
   eventually service information, online subscription and online help 
   servers. 

8.4 WWW-based authentication 

   Here, a Web based interface allows the user to enter authentication 
   information, usually a username and a password. The web server 
   providing this interface can be either a device local to the hot 
   spot, or some remote server to which access is allowed even if the 
   user is not yet properly authorized. 

   The WWW interface is usually secured using the HTTPS [7,8] protocol 
   (SSL or TLS [9]) rather than regular HTTP. This allows for 
   protection from eavesdropping on the wireless LAN. 

   Once the user has provided appropriate credentials and they have 
   been verified, filters are changed so that the user gets full access 
   to the Internet. 

8.5 Back-end systems 

   Back-end handling of authentication and accounting is not 
   standardized, but it is believed to be often based on RADIUS, with 
   the possible addition of proprietary extensions. 
     

   Caron          Informational - Expires July 2002                 8 
   INTERNET-DRAFT Public Wireless LAN Roaming Issues     February 2002 

    

8.6 Issues with existing setups 

   It is pretty clear that the existing setups do not meet all of the 
   requirements set forth in section 7, in particular: 

   - roaming is not transparent, user interaction using a WWW browser 
   is required; 

   - roaming is not secure, data can be captured by rogue APs. 

   Beyond that, there is no standard solution to carry authentication 
   information from the authentication gateways to the home server that 
   would meet all the requirements, in particular: 

   - open, scalable roaming 

   - transport of cost information 

   - non-repudiation 

9 Alternate solutions 

   One alternate solution lies in the use of IEEE 802.1X [10], an 
   implementation of EAP [11] as a network port access control 
   technique, together with appropriate EAP methods such as EAP TLS 
   [12] or EAP SRP [13], as the network-to-client authentication 
   interface. This would indeed satisfy many requirements, with the 
   following issues remaining: 

   - 802.1X requires low-level integration into firmware, drivers 
   and/or operating systems, both in the infrastructure and in the 
   clients, which might delay its widespread adoption. 

   - there is a need to present cost information to the user, and get 
   his/her acceptance of this cost, possibly within EAP. 

   Until 802.1X is widely deployed, an equivalent, but easily portable 
   authentication method is required. Extensions to support cost 
   presentation and approval are also needed. 

   On the back-end side, RADIUS or Diameter, transporting EAP, might 
   constitute a good basis for the requirements set forth, however a 
   number of extensions are needed: 

   - cost information encoding and handling; 

   - the ability to route authentication information for any user to 
   its home server, via a possibly complex chain of intermediaries; 

   - non-repudiation mechanisms;

   - in the case of RADIUS, additional security to compensate for the 
   known deficiencies of the protocol. 

10 Security Considerations 

   Security in a wireless roaming environment is paramount, and is 
   considered in section 7.2 above.
