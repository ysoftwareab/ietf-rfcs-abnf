Status of this Memo

    This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance
    with all provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026.

1. Introduction

    This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
    In particular, it defines Textual Conventions used in IETF PPVPN and
    PPVPN-related MIBs.


1.1 Conventions Used in This Document

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].


2. The SNMP Management Framework

    The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five
    major components:

    -  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571
       [RFC2571].

    -  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and
       events for the purpose of management.  The first
       version of this Structure of Management Information
       (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, RFC
       1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and STD 16,
       RFC 1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2,
       is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58,
       RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

    -  Message protocols for transferring management
       information.  The first version of the SNMP message
       protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC
       1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of the SNMP message
       protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
       protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
       [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version
       of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described
       in RFC 1906 [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574
       [RFC2574].

    -  Protocol operations for accessing management
       information.  The first set of protocol operations and
       associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC



PPVPN Working Group            Expires August 2002           [Page 2]

Internet Draft             PPVPN-TC MIB             February 28, 2002



       1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of protocol operations
       and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
       [RFC1905].

    -  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC
       2573 [RFC2573] and the view-based access control
       mechanism described in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

    A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP
    Management Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

    Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information
    store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
    Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms
    defined in the SMI.

    This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the
    SMIv2.  A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced
    through the appropriate translations.  The resulting
    translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except
    where objects or events are omitted because no
    translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine
    readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into
    textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation
    process.  However, this loss of machine readable
    information is not considered to change the semantics of
    the MIB.

4. Security Considerations

    This memo defines textual conventions and object
    identities for use in PPVPN MIB modules.  Security issues
    for these MIB modules are addressed in the memos defining
    those modules.
