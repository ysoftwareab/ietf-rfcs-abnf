<h1><br />Host Identity Protocol<br />draft-moskowitz-hip-rfc5201-bis-02</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
       This document specifies the details of the Host Identity
       Protocol (HIP).  HIP allows consenting hosts to securely
       establish and maintain shared IP-layer state, allowing
       separation of the identifier and locator roles of IP addresses,
       thereby enabling continuity of communications across IP address
       changes.  HIP is based on a SIGMA-compliant Diffie-Hellman key
       exchange, using public key identifiers from a new Host Identity
       namespace for mutual peer authentication.  The protocol is
       designed to be resistant to denial-of-service (DoS) and
       man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. When used together with
       another suitable security protocol, such as the Encapsulated
       Security Payload (ESP), it provides integrity protection and
       optional encryption for upper-layer protocols, such as TCP and
       UDP.
     
</p>
<p>
       This document obsoletes RFC 5201 and addresses the concerns
       raised by the IESG, particularly that of crypto agility.  It
       also incorporates lessons learned from the implementations of
       RFC 5201.

Introduction</h3>

<p>
       This memo specifies the details of the Host Identity Protocol
       (HIP).  A high-level description of the protocol and the
       underlying architectural thinking is available in the separate
       <a class='info' href='#rfc4423-bis'>HIP architecture description<span> (</span><span class='info'>Moskowitz, R., &ldquo;Host Identity Protocol Architecture,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> [rfc4423&#8209;bis].
       Briefly, the HIP architecture proposes an alternative to the
       dual use of IP addresses as "locators" (routing labels) and
       "identifiers" (endpoint, or host, identifiers).  In HIP, public
       cryptographic keys, of a public/private key pair, are used as
       Host Identifiers, to which higher layer protocols are bound
       instead of an IP address. By using public keys (and their
       representations) as host identifiers, dynamic changes to IP
       address sets can be directly authenticated between hosts, and
       if desired, strong authentication between hosts at the TCP/IP
       stack level can be obtained.
     
</p>
<p>
       This memo specifies the base HIP protocol ("base exchange")
       used between hosts to establish an IP-layer communications
       context, called HIP association, prior to communications.  It
       also defines a packet format and procedures for updating an
       active HIP association.  Other elements of the HIP architecture
       are specified in other documents, such as.

<a name="rfc.section.1.1"></a><h3>1.1.&nbsp;
A New Namespace and Identifiers</h3>

<p>
         The Host Identity Protocol introduces a new namespace, the
         Host Identity namespace. Some ramifications of this new
         namespace are explained in the HIP architecture description
         <a class='info' href='#rfc4423-bis'>[rfc4423&#8209;bis]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Moskowitz, R., &ldquo;Host Identity Protocol Architecture,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>.
       
</p>
<p>
         There are two main representations of the Host Identity, the
         full Host Identifier (HI) and the Host Identity Tag (HIT).
         The HI is a public key and directly represents the Identity.
         Since there are different public key algorithms that can be
         used with different key lengths, the HI is not good for use
         as a packet identifier, or as an index into the various
         operational tables needed to support HIP.  Consequently, a
         hash of the HI, the Host Identity Tag (HIT), becomes the
         operational representation.  It is 128 bits long and is used
         in the HIP payloads and to index the corresponding state in
         the end hosts.  The HIT has an important security property in
         that it is self-certifying (see <a class='info' href='#HI'>Section&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Host Identifier (HI) and Its Structure</span><span>)</span></a>).

<a name="rfc.section.1.2"></a><h3>1.2.&nbsp;
The HIP Base Exchange (BEX)</h3>

<p>
         The HIP base exchange is a two-party cryptographic protocol
         used to establish communications context between hosts.  The
         base exchange is a SIGMA-compliant <a class='info' href='#KRA03'>[KRA03]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Krawczyk, H., &ldquo;SIGMA: The 'SIGn-and-MAc' Approach to Authenticated Diffie-Hellman and Its Use in the IKE-Protocols,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>
         four-packet exchange.  The first party is called the
         Initiator and the second party the Responder.  The
         four-packet design helps to make HIP DoS resilient.  The
         protocol exchanges Diffie-Hellman keys in the 2nd and 3rd
         packets, and authenticates the parties in the 3rd and 4th
         packets.  Additionally, the Responder starts a puzzle
         exchange in the 2nd packet, with the Initiator completing it
         in the 3rd packet before the Responder stores any state from
         the exchange.
       
</p>
<p>
         The exchange can use the Diffie-Hellman output to encrypt the
         Host Identity of the Initiator in the 3rd packet (although
         Aura, et al., <a class='info' href='#AUR03'>[AUR03]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Aura, T., Nagarajan, A., and A. Gurtov, &ldquo;Analysis of the HIP Base Exchange Protocol,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> notes that such
         operation may interfere with packet-inspecting middleboxes),
         or the Host Identity may instead be sent unencrypted.  The
         Responder's Host Identity is not protected.  It should be
         noted, however, that both the Initiator's and the Responder's
         HITs are transported as such (in cleartext) in the packets,
         allowing an eavesdropper with a priori knowledge about the
         parties to verify their identities.
      
</p>
<p>
         Data packets start to flow after the 4th packet.  The 3rd and
         4th HIP packets may carry a data payload in the future.
         However, the details of this may be defined later.
       
</p>
<p>
         An existing HIP association can be updated using the update
         mechanism defined in this document, and when the association
         is no longer needed, it can be closed using the defined
         closing mechanism.
       
</p>
<p>
         Finally, HIP is designed as an end-to-end authentication and
         key establishment protocol, to be used with Encapsulated
         Security Payload (ESP) <a class='info' href='#RFC5202'>[RFC5202]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Jokela, P., Moskowitz, R., and P. Nikander, &ldquo;Using the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) Transport Format with the Host Identity Protocol (HIP),&rdquo; April&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> and other
         end-to-end security protocols.  The base protocol does not
         cover all the fine-grained policy control found in Internet
         Key Exchange (IKE) <a class='info' href='#RFC4306'>[RFC4306]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kaufman, C., &ldquo;Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) Protocol,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> that allows IKE
         to support complex gateway policies.  Thus, HIP is not a
         replacement for IKE.

Host Identifier (HI) and Its Structure</h3>

<p>
       In this section, the properties of the Host Identifier and Host
       Identifier Tag are discussed, and the exact format for them is
       defined.  In HIP, the public key of an asymmetric key pair is
       used as the Host Identifier (HI).  Correspondingly, the host
       itself is defined as the entity that holds the private key from
       the key pair.  See the HIP architecture specification <a class='info' href='#rfc4423-bis'>[rfc4423&#8209;bis]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Moskowitz, R., &ldquo;Host Identity Protocol Architecture,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> for more details about the difference
       between an identity and the corresponding identifier.

</p>
<p>
       A hashed encoding of the HI, the Host Identity Tag (HIT),
       is used in protocols to represent the Host Identity.  The
       HIT is 128 bits long and has the following three key properties:
       i) it is the same length as an IPv6 address and can be used
       in address-sized fields in APIs and protocols, ii) it is
       self-certifying (i.e., given a HIT, it is computationally
       hard to find a Host Identity key that matches the HIT), and
       iii) the probability of HIT collision between two hosts is
       very low, hence, it is infeasible for an attacker to find a
       collision with a HIT that is in use. For details on the
       security properties of the HIT see <a class='info' href='#rfc4423-bis'>[rfc4423&#8209;bis]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Moskowitz, R., &ldquo;Host Identity Protocol Architecture,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>.

Dupont, &ldquo;STUB: An IPv6 Prefix for Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash Identifiers (ORCHID),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>.  The HIT consists of three parts:
       first, an IANA assigned prefix to distinguish it from other
       IPv6 addresses.  Second, a four-bit encoding of the algorithms
       that were used for generating the HI and the hashed
       representation of HI.  Third, a 96-bit hashed representation of
       the Host Identity.  The encoding of the ORCHID generation

       Carrying HIs and HITs in the header of user data packets would
       increase the overhead of packets.  Thus, it is not expected
       that they are carried in every packet, but other methods are
       used to map the data packets to the corresponding HIs.  In some
       cases, this makes it possible to use HIP without any additional
       headers in the user data packets.  For example, if ESP is used
       to protect data traffic, the Security Parameter Index (SPI)
       carried in the ESP header can be used to map the encrypted data
       packet to the correct HIP association.

Host Identity Tag (HIT)</h3>

<p>
         The Host Identity Tag is a 128-bit value -- a hashed encoding
         of the Host Identifier.  There are two advantages of using a
         hashed encoding over the actual Host Identity public key in
         protocols.  Firstly, its fixed length makes for easier
         protocol coding and also better manages the packet size cost
         of this technology.  Secondly, it presents a consistent
         format to the protocol whatever underlying identity
         technology is used.

       The protocol number 139 has been assigned by IANA to the Host

       The <a class='info' href='#ssec-payload'>HIP payload<span> (</span><span class='info'>Payload Format</span><span>)</span></a> header could
       be carried in every IP datagram.  However, since HIP headers

       packets used to establish or change HIP association state.  The
       actual method for header 'compression' and for matching data
       packets with existing HIP associations (if any) is defined in

Creating a HIP Association</h3>

<p>
         By definition, the system initiating a HIP exchange is the
         Initiator, and the peer is the Responder.  This distinction
         is forgotten once the base exchange completes, and either
         party can become the Initiator in future communications.
       
</p>
<p>
         The HIP base exchange serves to manage the establishment of
         state between an Initiator and a Responder.  The first
         packet, I1, initiates the exchange, and the last three
         packets, R1, I2, and R2, constitute an authenticated
         Diffie-Hellman <a class='info' href='#DIF76'>[DIF76]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Diffie, W. and M. Hellman, &ldquo;New Directions in Cryptography,&rdquo; Nov&nbsp;1976.</span><span>)</span></a> key exchange for
         session key generation. In the first two packets, the hosts
         agree on a set of cryptographic identifiers and algorithms
         that then are used in and after the exchange.  During the
         Diffie-Hellman key exchange, a piece of keying material is
         generated.  The HIP association keys are drawn from this
         keying material.  If other cryptographic keys are needed,
         e.g., to be used with ESP, they are expected to be drawn from
         the same keying material.
       
</p>
<p>
         The Initiator first sends a trigger packet, I1, to the
         Responder.  The packet contains the HIT of the Initiator and
         possibly the HIT of the Responder, if it is known.  Moreover,
         the I1 packet initializes the negotiation of the
         Diffie-Hellman group that is used for generating the keying
         material. Therefore, the I1 contains a list of Diffie Hellman
         Group IDs supported by the Initiator.  Note that in some
         cases it may be possible to replace this trigger packet by
         some other form of a trigger, in which case the protocol
         starts with the Responder sending the R1 packet. In such
         cases, another mechanism to convey the Initiator's supported
         DH Groups (e.g., by using a default group) must be specified.
       
</p>
<p>
         The second packet, R1, starts the actual authenticated
         Diffie-Hellman exchange.  It contains a puzzle -- a
         cryptographic challenge that the Initiator must solve before
         continuing the exchange.  The level of difficulty of the
         puzzle can be adjusted based on level of trust with the
         Initiator, current load, or other factors.  In addition, the
         R1 contains the Responder's Diffie-Hellman parameter and
         lists of cryptographic algorithms supported by the Responder.
         Based on these lists, the Initiator can continue, abort, or
         restart the base exchange with a different selection of
         cryptographic algorithms. The R1 packet contains a signature
         that covers selected parts of the message. Some fields are
         left outside the signature to support pre-created R1s.
       
</p>
<p>
         In the I2 packet, the Initiator must display the solution to
         the received puzzle.  Without a correct solution, the I2
         message is discarded.  The I2 also contains a Diffie-Hellman
         parameter that carries needed information for the Responder.
         The packet is signed by the sender.
       
</p>
<p>
         The R2 packet acknowledges the receipt of the I2 and
         finalizes the base exchange. The packet is signed.
       
</p>
<p>
         The base exchange is illustrated below.  The term "key"
         refers to the Host Identity public key, and "sig" represents
         a signature using such a key.  The packets contain other
         parameters not shown in this figure.

HIP Puzzle Mechanism</h3>

<p>
           The purpose of the HIP puzzle mechanism is to protect the
           Responder from a number of denial-of-service threats.  It
           allows the Responder to delay state creation until
           receiving I2.  Furthermore, the puzzle allows the Responder
           to use a fairly cheap calculation to check that the
           Initiator is "sincere" in the sense that it has churned CPU
           cycles in solving the puzzle.
         
</p>
<p>
           The puzzle mechanism has been explicitly designed to give
           space for various implementation options.  It allows a
           Responder implementation to completely delay
           session-specific state creation until a valid I2 is
           received.  In such a case, a correctly formatted I2 can be
           rejected only once the Responder has checked its validity
           by computing one hash function.  On the other hand, the
           design also allows a Responder implementation to keep state
           about received I1s, and match the received I2s against the
           state, thereby allowing the implementation to avoid the
           computational cost of the hash function.  The drawback of
           this latter approach is the requirement of creating state.
           Finally, it also allows an implementation to use other
           combinations of the space-saving and computation-saving
           mechanisms.
         
</p>
<p>
           The Responder can remain stateless and drop most spoofed I2s
           because puzzle calculation is based on the Initiator's Host
           Identity Tag. The idea is that the Responder has a (perhaps
           varying) number of pre-calculated R1 packets, and it selects
           one of these based on the information carried in I1. When
           the Responder then later receives I2, it can verify that
           the puzzle has been solved using the Initiator's HIT.  This
           makes it impractical for the attacker to first exchange one
           I1/R1, and then generate a large number of spoofed I2s that
           seemingly come from different HITs. The method does not
           protect from an attacker that uses fixed HITs, though.
           Against such an attacker a viable approach may be to create
           a piece of local state, and remember that the puzzle check
           has previously failed.  See <a class='info' href='#resp-cookie'>Appendix&nbsp;A<span> (</span><span class='info'>Using Responder Puzzles</span><span>)</span></a>
           for one possible implementation.  Implementations SHOULD
           include sufficient randomness to the algorithm so that
           algorithmic complexity attacks become impossible <a class='info' href='#CRO03'>[CRO03]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Crosby, SA. and DS. Wallach, &ldquo;Denial of Service via Algorithmic Complexity            Attacks,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>.
         
</p>
<p>
           The Responder can set the puzzle difficulty for Initiator,
           based on its level of trust of the Initiator.  Because the
           puzzle is not included in the signature calculation, the
           Responder can use pre-calculated R1 packets and include the
           puzzle just before sending the R1 to the Initiator.  The
           Responder SHOULD use heuristics to determine when it is
           under a denial-of-service attack, and set the puzzle
           difficulty value K appropriately; see below.

Puzzle Exchange</h3>

<p>
           The Responder starts the puzzle exchange when it receives
           an I1.  The Responder supplies a random number I, and
           requires the Initiator to find a number J. &nbsp;To select
           a proper J, the Initiator must create the concatenation of
           I, the HITs of the parties, and J, and take a hash over
           this concatenation using the RHASH algorithm.  The lowest
           order K bits of the result MUST be zeros.  The value K sets
           the difficulty of the puzzle.
         
</p>
<p>
           To generate a proper number J, the Initiator will have to
           generate a number of Js until one produces the hash target
           of zeros.  The Initiator SHOULD give up after exceeding the
           puzzle lifetime in the PUZZLE parameter (<a class='info' href='#sec-puzzle'>Section&nbsp;5.2.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>PUZZLE</span><span>)</span></a>).  The Responder needs to re-create
           the concatenation of I, the HITs, and the provided J, and
           compute the hash once to prove that the Initiator did its
           assigned task.
         
</p>
<p>
           To prevent precomputation attacks, the Responder MUST
           select the number I in such a way that the Initiator cannot
           guess it.  Furthermore, the construction MUST allow the
           Responder to verify that the value I was indeed selected by
           it and not by the Initiator.  See <a class='info' href='#resp-cookie'>Appendix&nbsp;A<span> (</span><span class='info'>Using Responder Puzzles</span><span>)</span></a> for an example on how to implement
           this.

           include some data in R1 that the Initiator must copy
           unmodified in the corresponding I2 packet.  The Responder
           can generate the Opaque data in various ways; e.g., using
           encryption or hashing with some secret, the sent I, and
           possibly other related data.  Using the same secret, the
           received I (from the I2), and the other related data (if
           any), the Receiver can verify that it has itself sent the I
           to the Initiator. The Responder MUST periodically change
           such a used secret.
         
</p>
<p>
           It is RECOMMENDED that the Responder generates a new puzzle
           and new R1s once every few minutes.  Furthermore, it is
           RECOMMENDED that the Responder remembers an old puzzle at
           least Lifetime seconds after the puzzle has been
           deprecated.  These time values guarantee that the puzzle is
           valid for at least Lifetime and at most 2*Lifetime seconds.
           This limits the usability that an old, solved puzzle has to
           an attacker.
           
</p>
<p>
           NOTE: The protocol developers explicitly considered whether
           R1 should include a timestamp in order to protect the
           Initiator from replay attacks.  The decision was to NOT
           include a timestamp.
         
</p>
<p>
           NOTE: The protocol developers explicitly considered whether
           a memory bound function should be used for the puzzle
           instead of a CPU-bound function.  The decision was not to
           use memory-bound functions.  At the time of the decision,
           the idea of memory-bound functions was relatively new and
           their IPR status were unknown.  Once there is more
           experience about memory-bound functions and once their IPR
           status is better known, it may be reasonable to reconsider
           this decision.

Authenticated Diffie-Hellman Protocol with DH Group
         Negotiation</h3>

<p>
           The packets R1, I2, and R2 implement a standard
           authenticated Diffie-Hellman exchange. The Responder sends
           one of its public Diffie-Hellman keys and its public
           authentication key, i.e., its Host Identity, in R1.  The
           signature in R1 allows the Initiator to verify that the R1
           has been once generated by the Responder.  However, since
           it is precomputed and therefore does not cover
           association-specific information in the I1 packet, it does
           not protect from replay attacks.
         
</p>
<p>
           Before the actual authenticated Diffie-Hellman exchange,
           the Initiator expresses its preference regarding its choice
           of the DH groups in the I1 packet. The preference is
           expressed as a sorted list of DH Group IDs. The I1 packet
           is not protected by a signature. Therefore, this list is
           sent in an unauthenticated way to avoid costly computations
           for processing the I1 packet on the Responder's side. Based
           on the preferences of the Initiator, the Responder sends an
           R1 packet containing its most suitable public DH value. It
           also attaches a list of its own preferences to the R1 to
           convey the basis for the DH group selection to the
           Initiator.
           
           
         
</p>
<p>
            If none of the DH Group IDs in the I1 is supported by the
            Responder, the Responder selects the DH Group most
            suitable for it regardless of the Initiator's preference.
            It then sends the R1 containing this DH Group and its list
            of supported DH Group IDs to the Initiator.
         
</p>
<p>
           When the Initiator receives an R1, it gets one of the
           Responder's public Diffie-Hellman values and the list of DH
           Group IDs supported by the Responder. This list is covered
           by the signature in the R1 packet to avoid forgery.  The
           Initiator compares the Group ID of the public DH value in
           the R1 packet to the list of supported DH Group IDs in the
           R1 packets and to its own preferences expressed in the list
           of supported DH Group IDs. The Initiator continues the BEX
           only if the Group ID of the public DH value of the
           Responder matches the preferences of both Initiator and
           Responder. Otherwise, the communication is subject of a
           downgrade attack and the Initiator must restart the key
           exchange with a new I1 packet or must abort the key
           exchange. If the Responder's choice of the DH Group is not
           supported by the Initiator, the Initiator may abort the
           handshake or send a new I1 with a different list of
           supported DH Groups. However, the Initiator MUST verify the
           signature of the R1 packet before restarting or aborting
           the handshake. It MUST silently ignore the R1 packet if the
           signature is not valid.
         
</p>
<p>
           If the preferences regarding the DH Group ID match, the
           Initiator computes the Diffie-Hellman session key (Kij).
           It creates a HIP association using keying material from the
           session key (see <a class='info' href='#keymat'>Section&nbsp;6.5<span> (</span><span class='info'>HIP KEYMAT Generation</span><span>)</span></a>), and may use the
           association to encrypt its public authentication key, i.e.,
           Host Identity.  The resulting I2 contains the Initiator's
           Diffie-Hellman key and its (optionally encrypted) public
           authentication key. The signature in I2 covers all of the
           packet.
         
</p>
<p>
           The Responder extracts the Initiator Diffie-Hellman public
           key from the I2, computes the Diffie-Hellman session key,
           creates a corresponding HIP association, and decrypts the
           Initiator's public authentication key.  It can then verify
           the signature using the authentication key.
         
</p>
<p>
           The final message, R2, is needed to protect the Initiator
           from replay attacks.

HIP Replay Protection</h3>

<p>
           The HIP protocol includes the following mechanisms to
           protect against malicious replays.  Responders are
           protected against replays of I1 packets by virtue of the
           stateless response to I1s with presigned R1 messages.
           Initiators are protected against R1 replays by a
           monotonically increasing "R1 generation counter" included
           in the R1.  Responders are protected against replays or
           false I2s by the puzzle mechanism (<a class='info' href='#hip-cookie'>Section&nbsp;4.1.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>HIP Puzzle Mechanism</span><span>)</span></a> above), and optional use of opaque
           data.  Hosts are protected against replays to R2s and
           UPDATEs by use of a less expensive HMAC verification
           preceding HIP signature verification.
         
</p>
<p>
           The R1 generation counter is a monotonically increasing
           64-bit counter that may be initialized to any value.  The
           scope of the counter MAY be system-wide but SHOULD be per
           Host Identity, if there is more than one local host
           identity.  The value of this counter SHOULD be kept across
           system reboots and invocations of the HIP base exchange.
           This counter indicates the current generation of puzzles.
           Implementations MUST accept puzzles from the current
           generation and MAY accept puzzles from earlier generations.
           A system's local counter MUST be incremented at least as
           often as every time old R1s cease to be valid, and SHOULD
           never be decremented, lest the host expose its peers to the
           replay of previously generated, higher numbered R1s.  The
           R1 counter SHOULD NOT roll over.
         
</p>
<p>
           A host may receive more than one R1, either due to sending
           multiple I1s (<a class='info' href='#multi-i1'>Section&nbsp;6.6.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Sending Multiple I1s in Parallel</span><span>)</span></a>) or due to a
           replay of an old R1.  When sending multiple I1s, an
           Initiator SHOULD wait for a small amount of time (a
           reasonable time may be 2 * expected RTT) after the first R1
           reception to allow possibly multiple R1s to arrive, and it
           SHOULD respond to an R1 among the set with the largest R1
           generation counter.  If an Initiator is processing an R1 or
           has already sent an I2 (still waiting for R2) and it
           receives another R1 with a larger R1 generation counter, it
           MAY elect to restart R1 processing with the fresher R1, as
           if it were the first R1 to arrive.
         
</p>
<p>
           Upon conclusion of an active HIP association with another
           host, the R1 generation counter associated with the peer
           host SHOULD be flushed.  A local policy MAY override the
           default flushing of R1 counters on a per-HIT basis.  The
           reason for recommending the flushing of this counter is
           that there may be hosts where the R1 generation counter
           (occasionally) decreases; e.g., due to hardware failure.

Refusing a HIP Exchange</h3>

<p>
           A HIP-aware host may choose not to accept a HIP exchange.
           If the host's policy is to only be an Initiator, it should
           begin its own HIP exchange.  A host MAY choose to have such
           a policy since only the Initiator's HI is protected in the
           exchange.  There is a risk of a race condition if each
           host's policy is to only be an Initiator, at which point
           the HIP exchange will fail.
         
</p>
<p>
           If the host's policy does not permit it to enter into a HIP
           exchange with the Initiator, it should send an ICMP
           'Destination Unreachable, Administratively Prohibited'
           message.  A more complex HIP packet is not used here as it
           actually opens up more potential DoS attacks than a simple
           ICMP message.

Aborting a HIP Exchange</h3>

<p>
           Two HIP hosts may encounter situations in which they cannot
           complete a HIP exchange because of insufficient suport for
           cryptographic algorithms, in particular the HIT Suites and
           DH Groups. After receiving the R1 packet, the Initiator can
           determine whether the Responder supports the required
           cryptographic operations to successfully establish a HIP
           association. The Initiator can abort the BEX silently after
           receiving an R1 packet that indicates an unsupported set of
           algorithms. The specific conditions are described below.
         
</p>
<p>
           The R1 packet contains a signed list of HIT Suite IDs
           supported by the Responder. Therefore, the Initiator can
           determine whether its source HIT is supported by the
           Responder.  If the HIT Suite ID of the Initiator's HIT is
           not contained in the list of HIT Suites, the Initiator MAY
           abort the handshake silently or MAY restart the handshake
           with a new I1 packet that contains a source HIT supported
           by the Responder.
         
</p>
<p>
           During the Handshake, the Initiator and the Responder agree
           on a DH Group. The Responder selects the DH Group and its
           DH public value in the R1 based on the list of DH Suite IDs
           in the I1 packet. If the responder supports none of the DH
           Groups selected by the Initiator, the Responder selects an
           arbitrary DH and replies an R1 containing its list of
           supported DH Group IDs. In this case, the Initiator will
           receive an R1 packet containing the DH public value for an
           unsupported DH Group and the Responder's DH Group list in
           the signed part of the R1 packet. At this point, the
           Initiator MAY abort the handshake or MAY restart the
           handshake by sending a new I1 containing a selection of DH
           Group IDs that is supported by the Responder.

HIP Downgrade Protection</h3>

<p>
           In a downgrade attack, an attacker manipulates the packets
           of an Initiator and/or a Responder to unnoticeably
           influence the result of the cryptographic negotiations in
           the BEX to its favor. As a result, the victims select
           weaker cryptographic algorithms than they would have
           without the attacker's interference. Downgrade attacks can
           only be successful if these are not detected by the victims
           and the victims assume a secure communication channel.
         
</p>
<p>
           In HIP, almost all packet parameters related to
           cryptographic negotiations are covered by signatures. These
           parameters cannot be directly manipulated in a downgrade
           attack without invalidating the signature. However, signed
           packets can be subject to replay attacks. In such a replay
           attack, the attacker could use an old BEX packet with an
           outdated selection of cryptographic algorithms and replay
           it instead of a more recent packet with a collection of
           stronger cryptographic algorithms. Signed packets that
           could be subject to this replay attack are the R1 and I2
           packet.  However, replayed R1 and I2 packets cannot be used
           to successfully establish a HIP BEX because these packets
           also contain the public DH values of the Initiator and the
           Responder. Old DH values from replayed packet will lead to
           invalid keying material and mismatching shared secrets.
         
</p>
<p>
           In contrast to the first version of HIP <a class='info' href='#RFC5201'>[RFC5201]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Moskowitz, R., Nikander, P., Jokela, P., and T. Henderson, &ldquo;Host Identity Protocol,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>, this version begins the negotiation of
           the DH Groups already in the first BEX packet, the I1.  The
           I1 is, by intention, not protected by a signature to avoid
           CPU-intensive cryptographic operations for processing
           floods of I1s. Hence, the list of DH Group IDs in the I1 is
           vulnerable to forgery and manipulation. To thwart an
           unnoticed manipulation of the I1 packet, the Responder
           chooses the DH Group deterministically and includes its own
           list of DH Group IDs in the signed part of the R1 packet.
           The Initiator can detect an attempted downgrade attack by
           comparing the list of DH Group IDs in the R1 packet to its
           own preferences in the I1. If the choice of the DH Group
           in the R1 packet does not equal the best match of the two
           lists, the Initiator can conclude that its list in the I1
           was altered by an attacker. In this case, the Initiator can
           restart or abort the BEX. As mentioned before, the
           detection of the downgrade attack is sufficient to prevent
            it.

HIP Opportunistic Mode</h3>

<p>
           It is possible to initiate a HIP negotiation even if the
           Responder's HI (and HIT) is unknown.  In this case, the
           connection initializing I1 packet contains NULL (all zeros)
           as the destination HIT. This kind of connection setup is
           called opportunistic mode.
         
</p>
<p>
           The Responder may have multiple HITs due to multiple
           supported HIT Suites. Since the Responder's HIT Suite is
           not determined by the destination HIT of the I1 packet, the
           Responder can freely select a HIT of any HIT Suite.  The
           complete set of HIT Suites supported by the Initiator is
           not known to the Responder. Therefore, the Responder SHOULD
           use a Responder HIT of the same HIT Suite as the
           Initiator's HIT because this HIT Suite is obviously
           supported by the Initiator. If the Responder selects a
           different HIT that is not supported by the Initiator, the
           Initiator MAY restart the BEX with an I1 packet with a
           source HIT that is contained in the list of the Responder's
           HIT Suites in the R1 packet.
         
</p>
<p> Note that the Initiator cannot verify the signature of
         the R1 packet if the Responder's HIT Suite is not supported.
         Therefore, the Initiator MUST treat R1 packets with
         unsupported Responder HITs as potentially forged and MUST NOT
         use any parameters from the unverified R1 besides the HIT
         Suite List. Moreover, an Initiator that uses a unverified HIT
         Suite List to determine a possible source HIT from an R1
         packet MUST verify that the HIT_SUITE_LIST in the first
         unverified R1 packet matches the HIT_SUITE_LIST in the second
         R1 packet for which the Initiator supports the signature
         algorithm.  The Initiator MUST restart the BEX with a new I1
         packet with a source HIT mentioned in the verifiable R1 if
         the two lists do not match to mitigate downgrade attacks.
         
</p>
<p>
           There are both security and API issues involved with the
           opportunistic mode.
         
</p>
<p>
           Given that the Responder's HI is not known by the
           Initiator, there must be suitable API calls that allow the
           Initiator to request, directly or indirectly, that the
           underlying kernel initiate the HIP base exchange solely
           based on locators.  The Responder's HI will be tentatively
           available in the R1 packet, and in an authenticated form
           once the R2 packet has been received and verified.  Hence,
           it could be communicated to the application via new API
           mechanisms.  However, with a backwards-compatible API the
           application sees only the locators used for the initial
           contact.  Depending on the desired semantics of the API,
           this can raise the following issues:
         
</p>
<p>
           </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
               The actual locators may later change if an UPDATE
               message is used, even if from the API perspective the
               session still appears to be between specific locators.
               The locator update is still secure, however, and the
               session is still between the same nodes.
             
</li>
<li>
               Different sessions between the same locators may result
               in connections to different nodes, if the
               implementation no longer remembers which identifier the
               peer had in another session.  This is possible when the
               peer's locator has changed for legitimate reasons or
               when an attacker pretends to be a node that has the
               peer's locator.  Therefore, when using opportunistic
               mode, HIP MUST NOT place any expectation that the
               peer's HI returned in the R1 message matches any HI
               previously seen from that address.
               <br />
<br />

               If the HIP implementation and application do not have
               the same understanding of what constitutes a session,
               this may even happen within the same session. For
               instance, an implementation may not know when HIP state
               can be purged for UDP-based applications.
             
</li>
<li>
               As with all HIP exchanges, the handling of
               locator-based or interface-based policy is unclear for
               opportunistic mode HIP.  An application may make a
               connection to a specific locator because the
               application has knowledge of the security properties
               along the network to that locator.  If one of the nodes
               moves and the locators are updated, these security
               properties may not be maintained.  Depending on the
               security policy of the application, this may be a
               problem. This is an area of ongoing study.  As an
               example, there is work to create an API that
               applications can use to specify their security
               requirements in a similar context <a class='info' href='#btns-c-api'>[btns&#8209;c&#8209;api]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Richardson, M., Williams, N., Komu, M., and S. Tarkoma, &ldquo;C-Bindings for IPsec Application Programming Interfaces,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.
             
</li>
</ul><p>
         
</p>
<p>
           In addition, the following security considerations apply.
           The generation counter mechanism will be less efficient in
           protecting against replays of the R1 packet, given that the
           Responder can choose a replay that uses any HI, not just
           the one given in the I1 packet.
         
</p>
<p>
           More importantly, the opportunistic exchange is vulnerable
           to man-in-the-middle attacks, because the Initiator does
           not have any public key information about the peer. To
           assess the impacts of this vulnerability, we compare it to
           vulnerabilities in current, non-HIP-capable
           communications.
         
</p>
<p>
           An attacker on the path between the two peers can insert
           itself as a man-in-the-middle by providing its own
           identifier to the Initiator and then initiating another HIP
           session towards the Responder. For this to be possible, the
           Initiator must employ opportunistic mode, and the Responder
           must be configured to accept a connection from any
           HIP-enabled node.
         
</p>
<p>
           An attacker outside the path will be unable to do so, given
           that it cannot respond to the messages in the base
           exchange.
         
</p>
<p>
           These properties are characteristic also of communications
           in the current Internet. A client contacting a server
           without employing end-to-end security may find itself
           talking to the server via a man-in-the-middle, assuming
           again that the server is willing to talk to anyone.
         
</p>
<p>
           If end-to-end security is in place, then the worst that can
           happen in both the opportunistic HIP and normal IP cases is
           denial-of-service; an entity on the path can disrupt
           communications, but will be unable to insert itself as a
           man-in-the-middle.
         
</p>
<p>
           However, once the opportunistic exchange has successfully
           completed, HIP provides integrity protection and
           confidentiality for the communications, and can securely
           change the locators of the endpoints.
         
</p>
<p>
           As a result, it is believed that the HIP opportunistic mode
           is at least as secure as current IP.

Updating a HIP Association</h3>

<p>
         A HIP association between two hosts may need to be updated
         over time.  Examples include the need to rekey expiring user
         data security associations, add new security associations, or
         change IP addresses associated with hosts.  The UPDATE packet
         is used for those and other similar purposes.  This document
         only specifies the UPDATE packet format and basic processing
         rules, with mandatory parameters.  The actual usage is
         defined in separate specifications.
       
</p>
<p>
         HIP provides a general purpose UPDATE packet, which can carry
         multiple HIP parameters, for updating the HIP state between
         two peers.  The UPDATE mechanism has the following
         properties:
         </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
             UPDATE messages carry a monotonically increasing sequence
             number and are explicitly acknowledged by the peer.  Lost
             UPDATEs or acknowledgments may be recovered via
             retransmission.  Multiple UPDATE messages may be
             outstanding under certain circumstances.
           
</p>
<p>
             UPDATE is protected by both HIP_MAC and HIP_SIGNATURE
             parameters, since processing UPDATE signatures alone is a
             potential DoS attack against intermediate systems.
           
</p>
<p>
             UPDATE packets are explicitly acknowledged by the use of
             an acknowledgment parameter that echoes an individual
             sequence number received from the peer.  A single UPDATE
             packet may contain both a sequence number and one or more
             acknowledgment numbers (i.e., piggybacked
             acknowledgment(s) for the peer's UPDATE).
           
</p>
</blockquote><p>
       
</p>

Error Processing</h3>

<p>
         HIP error processing behavior depends on whether or not there
         exists an active HIP association.  In general, if a HIP
         association exists between the sender and receiver of a
         packet causing an error condition, the receiver SHOULD
         respond with a NOTIFY packet.  On the other hand, if there
         are no existing HIP associations between the sender and
         receiver, or the receiver cannot reasonably determine the
         identity of the sender, the receiver MAY respond with a
         suitable ICMP message; see <a class='info' href='#ICMP'>Section&nbsp;5.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>ICMP Messages</span><span>)</span></a> for more
         details.
       
</p>
<p>
         The HIP protocol and state machine is designed to recover
         from one of the parties crashing and losing its state.  The
         following scenarios describe the main use cases covered by
         the design.

         </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>No prior state between the two systems.

                 process follows the standard four-packet base

</p>
</blockquote>
           

<p>
             The system with data to send has no state with the
             receiver, but the receiver has a residual HIP
             association.

<blockquote class="text">
<p>
                 The system with data to send is the Initiator.  The
                 Initiator acts as in no prior state, sending I1 and
                 getting R1.  When the Responder receives a valid I2,
                 the old association is 'discovered' and deleted, and
                 the new association is established.
               
</p>
</blockquote>
           

<p>
             The system with data to send has a HIP association, but
             the receiver does not.

<blockquote class="text">

                 The system sends data on the outbound user data
                 security association.  The receiver 'detects' the

                 cannot match to any HIP association.  The receiving
                 host MUST discard this packet.
               
</p>
<p>
                 Optionally, the receiving host MAY send an ICMP
                 packet, with the type Parameter Problem, to inform
                 the sender that the HIP association does not exist
                 (see Section 5.4), and it MAY initiate a new HIP
                 negotiation. However, responding with these optional
                 mechanisms is implementation or policy dependent.

HIP State Machine</h3>

<p>
         The HIP protocol itself has little state.  In the HIP base
         exchange, there is an Initiator and a Responder.  Once the
         security associations (SAs) are established, this distinction
         is lost.  If the HIP state needs to be re-established, the
         controlling parameters are which peer still has state and
         which has a datagram to send to its peer.  The following
         state machine attempts to capture these processes.
       
</p>
<p>
         The state machine is presented in a single system view,
         representing either an Initiator or a Responder.  There is
         not a complete overlap of processing logic here and in the
         packet definitions.  Both are needed to completely implement
         HIP.
       
</p>
<p>
         This document extends the state machine defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC5201'>[RFC5201]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Moskowitz, R., Nikander, P., Jokela, P., and T. Henderson, &ldquo;Host Identity Protocol,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> and introduces a restart option to allow
         for the negotiation of cryptographic algorithms. The only
         change to the previous state machine is a transition from
         state I1-SENT to I1-SENT - the restart option. An Initiator
         is required to restart the HIP exchange if the Responder does
         not support the HIT Suite of the Initiator. In this case, the
         Initiator restarts the HIP exchange by sending a new I1
         packet with a source HIT supported by the Responder.
       
</p>
<p>
         Implementors must understand that the state machine, as
         described here, is informational.  Specific implementations
         are free to implement the actual functions differently.
         <a class='info' href='#packet_processing'>Section&nbsp;6<span> (</span><span class='info'>Packet Processing</span><span>)</span></a> describes the packet
         processing rules in more detail.  This state machine focuses
         on the HIP I1, R1, I2, and R2 packets only.  Other states may
         be introduced by mechanisms in other specifications (such as
         mobility and multihoming).

Reboot, Timeout, and Restart of HIP</h3>

<p>
           Simulating a loss of state is a potential DoS attack.  The
           following process has been crafted to manage state recovery
           without presenting a DoS opportunity.
         
</p>
<p>
           If a host reboots or the HIP association times out, it has
           lost its HIP state.  If the host that lost state has a
           datagram to send to the peer, it simply restarts the HIP
           base exchange.  After the base exchange has completed, the
           Initiator can create a new payload association and start
           sending data.  The peer does not reset its state until it
           receives a valid I2 HIP packet.
         
</p>
<p>
           If a system receives a user data packet that cannot be
           matched to any existing HIP association, it is possible
           that it has lost the state and its peer has not.  It MAY
           send an ICMP packet with the Parameter Problem type, and
           with the pointer pointing to the referred HIP-related
           association information.  Reacting to such traffic depends
           on the implementation and the environment where the
           implementation is used.
         
</p>
<p>
           If the host, that apparently has lost its state, decides to
           restart the HIP base exchange, it sends an I1 packet to the
           peer.  After the base exchange has been completed
           successfully, the Initiator can create a new HIP
           association and the peer drops its old payload associations
           and creates a new
           one.

<p>
         The HIP header is logically an IPv6 extension header.
         However, this document does not describe processing for Next
         Header values other than decimal 59, IPPROTO_NONE, the IPv6
         'no next header' value.  Future documents MAY do so.
         However, current implementations MUST ignore trailing data if
         an unimplemented Next Header value is received.
       
</p>
<p>
         The Header Length field contains the length of the HIP Header
         and HIP parameters in 8-byte units, excluding the first 8
         bytes.  Since all HIP headers MUST contain the sender's and
         receiver's HIT fields, the minimum value for this field is 4,
         and conversely, the maximum length of the HIP Parameters
         field is (255*8)-32 = 2008 bytes.  Note: this sets an
         additional limit for sizes of parameters included in the
         Parameters field, independent of the individual parameter
         maximum lengths.
       
</p>
<p>
         The Packet Type indicates the HIP packet type.  The
         individual packet types are defined in the relevant sections.
         If a HIP host receives a HIP packet that contains an unknown
         packet type, it MUST drop the packet.
       
</p>
<p>
         The HIP Version is four bits.  The current version is 2.  The
         version number is expected to be incremented only if there
         are incompatible changes to the protocol.  Most extensions
         can be handled by defining new packet types, new parameter
         types, or new controls.
       
</p>
<p>
         The following three bits are reserved for future use.  They
         MUST be zero when sent, and they SHOULD be ignored when
         handling a received packet.
       
</p>
<p>
         The two fixed bits in the header are reserved for potential
         SHIM6 compatibility <a class='info' href='#RFC5533'>[RFC5533]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nordmark, E. and M. Bagnulo, &ldquo;Shim6: Level 3 Multihoming Shim Protocol for IPv6,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.  For
         implementations adhering (only) to this specification, they
         MUST be set as shown when sending and MUST be ignored when
         receiving.  This is to ensure optimal forward compatibility.
         Note that for implementations that implement other compatible
         specifications in addition to this specification, the
         corresponding rules may well be different.  For example, in
         the case that the forthcoming SHIM6 protocol happens to be
         compatible with this specification, an implementation that
         implements both this specification and the SHIM6 protocol may
         need to check these bits in order to determine how to handle
         the packet.
       
</p>
<p>The HIT fields are always 128 bits (16 bytes) long.

           Since the checksum covers the source and destination

           the source and destination addresses are those used in the
           IP header, the zero field is obviously zero, the protocol
           is the HIP protocol number (see <a class='info' href='#proto_overview'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Protocol Overview</span><span>)</span></a>), and the length is calculated

HIP Fragmentation Support</h3>

<p>
           A HIP implementation must support IP
           fragmentation/reassembly.  Fragment reassembly MUST be
           implemented in both IPv4 and IPv6, but fragment generation
           is REQUIRED to be implemented in IPv4 (IPv4 stacks and
           networks will usually do this by default) and RECOMMENDED
           to be implemented in IPv6. In IPv6 networks, the minimum
           MTU is larger, 1280 bytes, than in IPv4 networks.  The
           larger MTU size is usually sufficient for most HIP packets,
           and therefore fragment generation may not be needed.  If a
           host expects to send HIP packets that are larger than the
           minimum IPv6 MTU, it MUST implement fragment generation
           even for IPv6.
         
</p>
<p>
           In IPv4 networks, HIP packets may encounter low MTUs along
           their routed path.  Since HIP does not provide a mechanism
           to use multiple IP datagrams for a single HIP packet,
           support for path MTU discovery does not bring any value to
           HIP in IPv4 networks.  HIP-aware NAT devices MUST perform
           any IPv4 reassembly/fragmentation.
         
</p>
<p>
           All HIP implementations have to be careful while employing
           a reassembly algorithm so that the algorithm is
           sufficiently resistant to DoS attacks.
         
</p>
<p>
           Because certificate chains can cause the packet to be
           fragmented and fragmentation can open implementation to
           denial-of-service attacks <a class='info' href='#KAU03'>[KAU03]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kaufman, C., Perlman, R., and B. Sommerfeld, &ldquo;DoS protection for UDP-based protocols,&rdquo; Oct&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>, it is
           strongly recommended that the separate document specifying
           the certificate usage in the HIP Base Exchange defines the
           usage of "Hash and URL" formats rather than including
           certificates in exchanges.  With this, most problems
           related to DoS attacks with fragmentation can be avoided.

TLV Format</h3>

<p>
           The TLV-encoded parameters are described in the following
           subsections.  The type-field value also describes the order
           of these fields in the packet, except for type values from
           2048 to 4095 which are reserved for new transport forms.
           The parameters MUST be included in the packet such that
           their types form an increasing order.  If the parameter can
           exist multiple times in the packet, the type value may be
           the same in consecutive parameters.  If the order does not
           follow this rule, the packet is considered to be malformed
           and it MUST be discarded.
         
</p>
<p>
           Parameters using type values from 2048 up to 4095 are
           transport formats.  Currently, one transport format is
           defined: the ESP transport format <a class='info' href='#RFC5202'>[RFC5202]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Jokela, P., Moskowitz, R., and P. Nikander, &ldquo;Using the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) Transport Format with the Host Identity Protocol (HIP),&rdquo; April&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.  The order of these parameters does not follow the
           order of their type value, but they are put in the packet
           in order of preference.  The first of the transport formats
           it the most preferred, and so on.
         
</p>
<p>
           All of the TLV parameters have a length (including Type and
           Length fields), which is a multiple of 8 bytes.  When
           needed, padding MUST be added to the end of the parameter
           so that the total length becomes a multiple of 8 bytes.
           This rule ensures proper alignment of data.  Any added
           padding bytes MUST be zeroed by the sender, and their
           values SHOULD NOT be checked by the receiver.
         
</p>
<p>
           Consequently, the Length field indicates the length of the
           Contents field (in bytes).  The total length of the TLV
           parameter (including Type, Length, Contents, and Padding)
           is related to the Length field according to the following
           formula:
         
</p>
<p>
           Total Length = 11 + Length - (Length + 3) % 8;

           It MAY send an ICMP or NOTIFY, as defined in <a class='info' href='#error_proc'>Section&nbsp;4.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Error Processing</span><span>)</span></a>.

           The following rules must be followed when defining new
           parameters.

           </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>
               The low-order bit C of the Type code is used to
               distinguish between critical and non-critical
               parameters.
             
</li>
<li>
               A new parameter may be critical only if an old
               recipient ignoring it would cause security problems.
               In general, new parameters SHOULD be defined as
               non-critical, and expect a reply from the recipient.
             
</li>
<li>
               If a system implements a new critical parameter, it
               MUST provide the ability to set the associated feature
               off, such that the critical parameter is not sent at
               all.  The configuration option must be well documented.
               Implementations operating in a mode adhering to this
               specification MUST disable the sending of new critical
               parameters.  In other words, the management interface
               MUST allow vanilla standards-only mode as a default
               configuration setting, and MAY allow new critical
               payloads to be configured on (and off).

<p>
           The R1_COUNTER parameter contains a 64-bit unsigned integer
           in network-byte order, indicating the current generation of
           valid puzzles.  The sender is supposed to increment this
           counter periodically.  It is RECOMMENDED that the counter
           value is incremented at least as often as old PUZZLE values
           are deprecated so that SOLUTIONs to them are no longer
           accepted.
         
</p>
<p>
           The R1_COUNTER parameter is optional.  It SHOULD be
           included in the R1 (in which case, it is covered by the
           signature), and if present in the R1, it MAY be echoed
           (including the Reserved field verbatim) by the Initiator in
           the I2.

<p>
           The PUZZLE parameter contains the puzzle difficulty K and a
           n-bit puzzle random integer #I. The Puzzle Lifetime
           indicates the time during which the puzzle solution is
           valid, and sets a time limit that should not be exceeded by
           the Initiator while it attempts to solve the puzzle.  The
           lifetime is indicated as a power of 2 using the formula
           2^(Lifetime-32) seconds.  A puzzle MAY be augmented with an
           ECHO_REQUEST_SIGNED or an ECHO_REQUEST_UNSIGNED parameter
           included in the R1; the contents of the echo request are
           then echoed back in the ECHO_RESPONSE_SIGNED or in the

           included information as a part of its puzzle processing.

           web surfing) and when the equipment is not powerful enough

           To avoid unnecessary failures during the base exchange, the

                 The list of IDs is ordered by preference of the
                 host. Each HIT Suite ID is one octet long. The four
                 higher-order bits correspond to the HIT Suite ID in

<p>
           The ID field in the HIT_SUITE_LIST is defined as eight-bit
           field opposed to the four-bit HIT Suite ID and OGA field in
           the ORCHID. This difference is a measure to accommodate
           larger HIT Suite IDs if the 16 available values prove
           insufficient.  In that case, one of the 16 values (0) will
           be used to indicate that four additional bits of the ORCHID
           will be used to encode the HIT Suite ID. Hence, the current
           four-bit HIT Suite-IDs only use the four higher order bits
           in the ID field. Future documents may define the use of the
           four lower-order bits in the ID field.

           The DH_GROUP_LIST parameter contains the list of supported DH
           Group IDs of a host. The Initiator sends
           the DH_GROUP_LIST in the I1 packet, the Responder sends it in the

           DH_GROUP_LIST are listed in the order of their preference
           of the host. DH Group IDs that are listed first are
           preferred compared to the DH Group IDs listed later. The
           information in the DH_GROUP_LIST allows the Responder to select
           the DH group preferred by itself and the Initiator. Based on
           the DH_GROUP_LIST in the R1 packet, the Initiator can determine
           if the Responder has selected the best possible choice based
           on the Initiator's and Responder's preferences. If the
           Responder's choice differs from the best choice, the
           Initiator can conclude that there was an attempted downgrade
           attack.

<p>
           When selecting the DH group for the DIFFIE_HELLMAN
           parameter in the R1 packet, the Responder MUST select the

           The Update ID is an unsigned quantity, initialized by a
           host to zero upon moving to ESTABLISHED state.  The Update
           ID has scope within a single HIP association, and not
           across multiple associations or multiple hosts.  The Update
           ID is incremented by one before each new UPDATE that is
           sent by the host; the first UPDATE packet originated by a
           host has an Update ID of 0.

  IV             Initialization vector, if needed, otherwise

                 the HIP_CIPHER.
  Encrypted      The data is encrypted using an encryption algorithm
    data         as defined in the HIP_CIPHER parameter.
</pre></div>
<p>
          The ENCRYPTED parameter encapsulates another parameter, the
          encrypted data, which holds one or more HIP parameters in
          block encrypted form.
        
</p>
<p>
           Consequently, the first fields in the encapsulated
           parameter(s) are Type and Length of the first such
           parameter, allowing the contents to be easily parsed after
           decryption.
        
</p>
<p>
          The field labelled "Encrypted data" consists of the output
          of one or more HIP parameters concatenated together that
          have been passed through an encryption algorithm.  Each of
          these inner parameters is padded according to the rules of
          <a class='info' href='#tlvformat'>Section&nbsp;5.2.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>TLV Format</span><span>)</span></a> for padding individual
          parameters.  As a result, the concatenated parameters will
          be a block of data that is 8-byte aligned.
        
</p>
<p>
          Some encryption algorithms require that the data to be
          encrypted must be a multiple of the cipher algorithm block
          size.  In this case, the above block of data MUST include
          additional padding, as specified by the encryption
          algorithm.  The size of the extra padding is selected so
          that the length of the unencrypted data block is a multiple
          of the cipher block size.  The encryption algorithm may
          specify padding bytes other than zero; for example, <a class='info' href='#FIPS.197.2001'>AES<span> (</span><span class='info'>National Institute of Standards and Technology, &ldquo;Advanced Encryption Standard (AES),&rdquo; November&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> [FIPS.197.2001] uses the PKCS5 padding
          scheme (see section 6.1.1 of <a class='info' href='#RFC2898'>[RFC2898]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kaliski, B., &ldquo;PKCS #5: Password-Based Cryptography Specification Version 2.0,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>) where
          the remaining n bytes to fill the block each have the value
          n. This yields an "unencrypted data" block that is
          transformed to an "encrypted data" block by the cipher
          suite.  This extra padding added to the set of parameters to
          satisfy the cipher block alignment rules is not counted in
          HIP TLV length fields, and this extra padding should be
          removed by the cipher suite upon decryption.
        
</p>
<p>
          Note that the length of the cipher suite output may be
          smaller or larger than the length of the set of parameters
          to be encrypted, since the encryption process may compress
          the data or add additional padding to the data.
        
</p>
<p>
          Once this encryption process is completed, the Encrypted
          data field is ready for inclusion in the Parameter.  If
          necessary, additional Padding for 8-byte alignment is then
          added according to the rules of <a class='info' href='#tlvformat'>Section&nbsp;5.2.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>TLV Format</span><span>)</span></a>.

  INVALID_SYNTAX                             7

    Indicates that the HIP message received was invalid because
    some type, length, or value was out of range or because the
    request was rejected for policy reasons.  To avoid a denial-
    of-service attack using forged messages, this status may only be

    error not covered by one of the other status types, and should
    not contain details to avoid leaking information to someone
    probing a node.  To aid debugging, more detailed error
    information SHOULD be written to a console or log.

    one offered by the Responder.

  AUTHENTICATION_FAILED                     24

    Sent in response to a HIP signature failure, except when
    the signature verification fails in a NOTIFY message.

  CHECKSUM_FAILED                           26

    Sent in response to a HIP checksum failure.

  HIP_MAC_FAILED                               28

    Sent in response to a HIP HMAC failure.

  ENCRYPTION_FAILED                         32

    The Responder could not successfully decrypt the
    ENCRYPTED parameter.

  INVALID_HIT                               40

    Sent in response to a failure to validate the peer's
    HIT from the corresponding HI.

  BLOCKED_BY_POLICY                         42

    The Responder is unwilling to set up an association
    for some policy reason (e.g., received HIT is NULL
    and policy does not allow opportunistic mode).

  SERVER_BUSY_PLEASE_RETRY                  44

    The Responder is unwilling to set up an association as it is
    suffering under some kind of overload and has chosen to shed load
    by rejecting the Initiator's request.  The Initiator may retry;
    however, the Initiator MUST find another (different) puzzle
    solution for any such retries.  Note that the Initiator may need
    to obtain a new puzzle with a new I1/R1 exchange.

  I2_ACKNOWLEDGEMENT                        16384

    The Responder has an I2 from the Initiator but had to queue the
    I2 for processing.  The puzzle was correctly solved and the
    Responder is willing to set up an association but currently has a
    number of I2s in the processing queue.  R2 will be sent after the

<p>Packets consist of the fixed header as described in <a class='info' href='#ssec-payload'>Section&nbsp;5.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Payload Format</span><span>)</span></a>, followed by the parameters.  The
       parameter part, in turn, consists of zero or more TLV-coded

<p>
         In addition to the base packets, other packet types will be

         In the future, an OPTIONAL upper-layer payload MAY follow the

<p>The I1 packet contains the fixed HIP header and the

</p>
<p>Valid control bits: none
</p>
<p>
           The Initiator gets the Responder's HIT either from a DNS
           lookup of the Responder's FQDN, from some other repository,
           or from a local table.  If the Initiator does not know the
           Responder's HIT, it may attempt to use opportunistic mode
           by using NULL (all zeros) as the Responder's HIT.  See also
           <a class='info' href='#op_mode'>"HIP Opportunistic Mode"<span> (</span><span class='info'>HIP Opportunistic Mode</span><span>)</span></a>.
         
</p>
<p>
           Since this packet is so easy to spoof even if it were
           signed, no attempt is made to add to its generation or
           processing cost.
         
</p>
<p>
           The Initiator includes a DH_GROUP_LIST parameter in the I1
           to inform the Responder of its preferred DH Group IDs.
           Note that the DH_GROUP_LIST in the I1 packet is not
           protected by a signature.

           Implementations MUST be able to handle a storm of received

</p>
<p>
           The Initiator's HIT MUST match the one received in I1.  If
           the Responder has multiple HIs, the Responder's HIT used
           MUST match Initiator's request.  If the Initiator used
           opportunistic mode, the Responder may select freely among
           its HIs.  See also <a class='info' href='#op_mode'>"HIP

</p>
<p>
           The R1 generation counter is used to determine the
           currently valid generation of puzzles.  The value is
           increased periodically, and it is RECOMMENDED that it is
           increased at least as often as solutions to old puzzles are
           no longer accepted.
         
</p>
<p>
           The Puzzle contains a Random #I and the difficulty K.
           &nbsp;The difficulty K indicates the number of lower-order
           bits, in the puzzle hash result, that must be zeros; see
           <a class='info' href='#puzzle_exchange'>Section&nbsp;4.1.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Puzzle Exchange</span><span>)</span></a>.  The Random #I is not
           covered by the signature and must be zeroed during the
           signature calculation, allowing the sender to select and
           set the #I into a precomputed R1 just prior sending it to
           the peer.
         
</p>
<p>
           The Responder selects the Diffie-Hellman public value based
           on the Initiator's preference expressed in the
           DH_GROUP_LIST parameter in the I1. The Responder sends back
           its own preference based on which it chose the DH public
           value as DH_GROUP_LIST. This allows the Initiator to
           determine whether its own DH_GROUP_LIST in the I1 was
           manipulated by an attacker.
         
</p>
<p>
           The Diffie-Hellman public value is ephemeral, and one value
           SHOULD be used only for one connection.  Once the Responder
           has received a valid response to an R1 packet, that
           Diffie-Hellman value SHOULD be deprecated.  Because it is
           possible that the Responder has sent the same
           Diffie-Hellman value to different hosts simultaneously in
           corresponding R1 packets, those responses should also be
           accepted.  However, as a defense against I1 storms, an
           implementation MAY propose, and re-use if not avoidable,
           the same Diffie-Hellman value for a period of time, for
           example, 15 minutes.  By using a small number of different
           puzzles for a given Diffie-Hellman value, the R1 packets
           can be precomputed and delivered as quickly as I1 packets
           arrive.  A scavenger process should clean up unused
           Diffie-Hellman values and puzzles.
         
</p>
<p>
           Re-using Diffie-Hellman public keys opens up the potential
           security risk of more than one Initiator ending up with the
           same keying material (due to faulty random number
           generators).  Also, more than one Initiator using the same
           Responder public key half may lead to potentially easier
           cryptographic attacks and to imperfect forward security.
         
</p>
<p>
           However, these risks involved in re-using the same key are
           statistical; that is, the authors are not aware of any
           mechanism that would allow manipulation of the protocol so
           that the risk of the re-use of any given Responder
           Diffie-Hellman public key would differ from the base
           probability.  Consequently, it is RECOMMENDED that
           implementations avoid re-using the same DH key with
           multiple Initiators, but because the risk is considered
           statistical and not known to be manipulable, the
           implementations MAY re-use a key in order to ease
           resource-constrained implementations and to increase the
           probability of successful communication with legitimate
           clients even under an I1 storm.  In particular, when it is
           too expensive to generate enough precomputed R1 packets to
           supply each potential Initiator with a different DH key,
           the Responder MAY send the same DH key to several
           Initiators, thereby creating the possibility of multiple
           legitimate Initiators ending up using the same
           Responder-side public key.  However, as soon as the
           Responder knows that it will use a particular DH key, it
           SHOULD stop offering it.  This design is aimed to allow
           resource-constrained Responders to offer services under I1
           storms and to simultaneously make the probability of DH
           key re-use both statistical and as low as possible.
         
</p>
<p>
           If a future version of this protocol is considered, we
           strongly recommend that these issues be studied again.
           Especially, the current design allows hosts to become
           potentially more vulnerable to a statistical,
           low-probability problem during I1 storm attacks than what
           they are if no attack is taking place; whether this is
           acceptable or not should be reconsidered in the light of
           any new experience gained.
         
</p>
<p>
           The HIP_CIPHER contains the encryption algorithms
           supported by the Responder to encrypt the ENCRYPTED
           parameter, in the order of preference. All implementations MUST support
           AES <a class='info' href='#RFC3602'>[RFC3602]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Frankel, S., Glenn, R., and S. Kelly, &ldquo;The AES-CBC Cipher Algorithm and Its Use with IPsec,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>.
         
</p>
<p>
           The HIT_SUITE_LIST parameter is an ordered list of the
           Responder's preferred and supported HIT Suites. The list
           allows the Initiator to determine whether its own source
           HIT is suitable.
         
</p>
<p>
           The ECHO_REQUEST_SIGNED and ECHO_REQUEST_UNSIGNED contains
           data that the sender wants to receive unmodified in the
           corresponding response packet in the ECHO_RESPONSE_SIGNED
           or ECHO_RESPONSE_UNSIGNED parameter.
         
</p>
<p>
           The signature is calculated over the whole HIP envelope,
           after setting the Initiator's HIT, header checksum, as well
           as the Opaque field and the Random #I in the PUZZLE
           parameter temporarily to zero, and excluding any parameters
           that follow the signature, as described in <a class='info' href='#HIP_SIGNATURE_2'>Section&nbsp;5.2.14<span> (</span><span class='info'>HIP_SIGNATURE_2</span><span>)</span></a>.  This allows the Responder to
           use precomputed R1s.  The Initiator SHOULD validate this
           signature.  It SHOULD check that the Responder's HI
           received matches with the one expected, if any.

UPDATE - the HIP Update Packet</h3>

<p>Support for the UPDATE packet is MANDATORY.
</p>
<p>The HIP header values for the UPDATE packet:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
  Header:
    Packet Type = 16
    SRC HIT = Sender's HIT

  IP ( HIP ( [SEQ, ACK, ] HIP_MAC, HIP_SIGNATURE ) )
</pre></div>
<p>Valid control bits: None
</p>
<p>
           The UPDATE packet contains mandatory HIP_MAC and
           HIP_SIGNATURE parameters, and other optional parameters.
         
</p>
<p>
           The UPDATE packet contains zero or one SEQ parameter.  The
           presence of a SEQ parameter indicates that the receiver
           MUST ACK the UPDATE.  An UPDATE that does not contain a SEQ
           parameter is simply an ACK of a previous UPDATE and itself
           MUST NOT be ACKed.
         
</p>
<p>
           An UPDATE packet contains zero or one ACK parameters.  The
           ACK parameter echoes the SEQ sequence number of the UPDATE
           packet being ACKed.  A host MAY choose to ACK more than one
           UPDATE packet at a time; e.g., the ACK may contain the last
           two SEQ values received, for robustness to ACK loss.  ACK
           values are not cumulative; each received unique SEQ value
           requires at least one corresponding ACK value in reply.
           Received ACKs that are redundant are ignored.
         
</p>
<p>
           The UPDATE packet may contain both a SEQ and an ACK
           parameter.  In this case, the ACK is being piggybacked on
           an outgoing UPDATE.  In general, UPDATEs carrying SEQ
           SHOULD be ACKed upon completion of the processing of the
           UPDATE.  A host MAY choose to hold the UPDATE carrying ACK
           for a short period of time to allow for the possibility of
           piggybacking the ACK parameter, in a manner similar to TCP
           delayed acknowledgments.
         
</p>
<p>
           A sender MAY choose to forgo reliable transmission of a
           particular UPDATE (e.g., it becomes overcome by events).
           The semantics are such that the receiver MUST acknowledge
           the UPDATE, but the sender MAY choose to not care about
           receiving the ACK.
         
</p>
<p>
           UPDATEs MAY be retransmitted without incrementing SEQ.  If
           the same subset of parameters is included in multiple
           UPDATEs with different SEQs, the host MUST ensure that the
           receiver's processing of the parameters multiple times will
           not result in a protocol error.

Packet Processing</h3>

<p>
       Each host is assumed to have a single HIP protocol
       implementation that manages the host's HIP associations and
       handles requests for new ones.  Each HIP association is
       governed by a conceptual state machine, with states defined
       above in <a class='info' href='#state-machine'>Section&nbsp;4.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>HIP State Machine</span><span>)</span></a>.  The HIP
       implementation can simultaneously maintain HIP associations
       with more than one host.  Furthermore, the HIP implementation
       may have more than one active HIP association with another
       host; in this case, HIP associations are distinguished by their
       respective HITs.  It is not possible to have more than one HIP
       association between any given pair of HITs.  Consequently, the
       only way for two hosts to have more than one parallel
       association is to use different HITs, at least at one end.
     
</p>
<p>
       The processing of packets depends on the state of the HIP
       association(s) with respect to the authenticated or apparent
       originator of the packet.  A HIP implementation determines
       whether it has an active association with the originator of the
       packet based on the HITs.  In the case of user data carried in
       a specific transport format, the transport format document
       specifies how the incoming packets are matched with the active
       associations.

Processing Outgoing Application Data</h3>

<p>
         In a HIP host, an application can send application-level data
         using an identifier specified via the underlying API.  The
         API can be a backwards-compatible API (see <a class='info' href='#RFC5338'>[RFC5338]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Henderson, T., Nikander, P., and M. Komu, &ldquo;Using the Host Identity Protocol with Legacy Applications,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>), using identifiers that look similar to
         IP addresses, or a completely new API, providing enhanced
         services related to Host Identities.  Depending on the HIP
         implementation, the identifier provided to the application
         may be different; for example, it can be a HIT or an IP
         address.
       
</p>
<p>
         The exact format and method for transferring the data from the
         source HIP host to the destination HIP host is defined in the
         corresponding transport format document.  The actual data is
         transferred in the network using the appropriate source and
         destination IP addresses.
       
</p>
<p>
         In this document, conceptual processing rules are defined
         only for the base case where both hosts have only single
         usable IP addresses; the multi-address multi-homing case will
         be specified separately.
       
</p>
<p>
         The following conceptual algorithm describes the steps that
         are required for handling outgoing datagrams destined to a
         HIT.

         </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>
             If the datagram has a specified source address, it MUST
             be a HIT.  If it is not, the implementation MAY replace
             the source address with a HIT.  Otherwise, it MUST drop
             the packet.
           
</li>
<li>
             If the datagram has an unspecified source address, the
             implementation must choose a suitable source HIT for the
             datagram.
           
</li>
<li>
             If there is no active HIP association with the given
             &lt;source, destination&gt; HIT pair, one must be created
             by running the base exchange.  While waiting for the base
             exchange to complete, the implementation SHOULD queue at
             least one packet per HIP association to be formed, and it
             MAY queue more than one.
           
</li>
<li>
             Once there is an active HIP association for the given
             &lt;source, destination&gt; HIT pair, the outgoing
             datagram is passed to transport handling.  The possible
             transport formats are defined in separate documents, of
             which the ESP transport format for HIP is mandatory for
             all HIP implementations.
           
</li>
<li>
             Before sending the packet, the HITs in the datagram are
             replaced with suitable IP addresses.  For IPv6, the rules
             defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC3484'>[RFC3484]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Draves, R., &ldquo;Default Address Selection for Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> SHOULD be followed.
             Note that this HIT-to-IP-address conversion step MAY also
             be performed at some other point in the stack, e.g.,
             before wrapping the packet into the output format.

Processing Incoming Application Data</h3>

<p>
         The following conceptual algorithm describes the incoming
         datagram handling when HITs are used at the receiving host as
         application-level identifiers.  More detailed steps for
         processing packets are defined in corresponding transport
         format documents.
       
</p>
<p>

       </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>
             The incoming datagram is mapped to an existing HIP
             association, typically using some information from the
             packet.  For example, such mapping may be based on the ESP
             Security Parameter Index (SPI).
           
</li>
<li>
             The specific transport format is unwrapped, in a way
             depending on the transport format, yielding a packet that
             looks like a standard (unencrypted) IP packet.  If
             possible, this step SHOULD also verify that the packet
             was indeed (once) sent by the remote HIP host, as
             identified by the HIP association.  
             <br />
<br />


             Depending on the used transport mode, the verification
             method can vary. While the HI (as well as HIT) is used as
             the higher-layer identifier, the verification method has
             to verify that the data packet was sent by a node
             identity and that the actual identity maps to this
             particular HIT. When using ESP transport format <a class='info' href='#RFC5202'>[RFC5202]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Jokela, P., Moskowitz, R., and P. Nikander, &ldquo;Using the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) Transport Format with the Host Identity Protocol (HIP),&rdquo; April&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>, the verification is done using the
             SPI value in the data packet to find the corresponding SA
             with associated HIT and key, and decrypting the packet
             with that associated key.
           
</li>
<li>
             The IP addresses in the datagram are replaced with the
             HITs associated with the HIP association.  Note that this
             IP-address-to-HIT conversion step MAY also be performed
             at some other point in the stack.
           
</li>
<li>
             The datagram is delivered to the upper layer.  When
             demultiplexing the datagram, the right upper-layer socket
             is based on the HITs.

HMAC Calculation</h3>

<p>
           The following process applies both to the HIP_MAC and
           HIP_MAC_2 parameters.  When processing HIP_MAC_2, the
           difference is that the HIP_MAC calculation includes a
           pseudo HOST_ID field containing the Responder's information
           as sent in the R1 packet earlier.
         
</p>
<p>
           Both the Initiator and the Responder should take some care
           when verifying or calculating the HIP_MAC_2. Specifically,
           the Responder should preserve other parameters than the
           HOST_ID when sending the R2. Also, the Initiator has to
           preserve the HOST_ID exactly as it was received in the R1
           packet.
         
</p>
<p>
           The scope of the calculation for HIP_MAC and HIP_MAC_2 is:

<p>
         Sort(HIT-I | HIT-R) is defined as the network byte order
         concatenation of the two HITs, with the smaller HIT preceding
         the larger HIT, resulting from the numeric comparison of the
         two HITs interpreted as positive (unsigned) 128-bit integers
         in network byte order.

<p>
         I and J values are from the puzzle and its solution that were
         exchanged in R1 and I2 messages when this HIP association was
         set up.  Both hosts have to store I and J values for the HIP
         association for future use.
       
</p>
<p>
         The initial keys are drawn sequentially in the order that is
         determined by the numeric comparison of the two HITs, with
         comparison method described in the previous paragraph.
         HOST_g denotes the host with the greater HIT value, and
         HOST_l the host with the lower HIT value.

<p>The number of bits drawn for a given algorithm is the

Initiation of a HIP Exchange</h3>

<p>
         An implementation may originate a HIP exchange to another
         host based on a local policy decision, usually triggered by
         an application datagram, in much the same way that an IPsec
         IKE key exchange can dynamically create a Security
         Association.  Alternatively, a system may initiate a HIP
         exchange if it has rebooted or timed out, or otherwise lost
         its HIP state, as described in <a class='info' href='#reboot'>Section&nbsp;4.5.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Reboot, Timeout, and Restart of HIP</span><span>)</span></a>.
       
</p>
<p>
         The implementation prepares an I1 packet and sends it to the
         IP address that corresponds to the peer host.  The IP address
         of the peer host may be obtained via conventional mechanisms,
         such as DNS lookup.  The I1 contents are specified in <a class='info' href='#I1'>Section&nbsp;5.3.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>I1 - the HIP Initiator Packet</span><span>)</span></a>.  The selection of which Host Identity to use,
         if a host has more than one to choose from, is typically a
         policy decision.
       
</p>
<p>
         The following steps define the conceptual processing rules for
         initiating a HIP exchange:

         </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>
             The Initiator gets one or more of the Responder's HITs and one or more
             addresses either from a DNS lookup of the Responder's
             FQDN, from some other repository, or from a local table.
             If the Initiator does not know the Responder's HIT, it
             may attempt opportunistic mode by using NULL (all zeros)
             as the Responder's HIT.  See also <a class='info' href='#op_mode'>"HIP Opportunistic Mode"<span> (</span><span class='info'>HIP Opportunistic Mode</span><span>)</span></a>.  If the Initiator can
             choose from multiple Responder HITs, it selects a HIT for
             which the Initiator supports the HIT Suite.
           
</li>
<li>
             The Initiator sends an I1 to one of the Responder's
             addresses.  The selection of which address to use is a
             local policy decision.
           
</li>
<li>
             The Initiator includes the DH_GROUP_LIST in the I1
             packet. The selection and order of DH Group IDs in the
             DH_GROUP_LIST MUST be stored by the Initiator because
             this list is needed for later R1 processing. In most
             cases, the preferences regarding the DH Groups will be
             static, so no per-association storage is necessary.
           
</li>
<li>
             Upon sending an I1, the sender transitions to state
             I1-SENT, starts a timer whose timeout value SHOULD be
             larger than the worst-case anticipated RTT, and SHOULD
             increment a timeout counter associated with the I1.
           
</li>
<li>
             Upon timeout, the sender SHOULD retransmit the I1 and
             restart the timer, up to a maximum of I1_RETRIES_MAX
             tries.
           
</li>

Sending Multiple I1s in Parallel</h3>

<p>
           For the sake of minimizing the session establishment
           latency, an implementation MAY send the same I1 to more
           than one of the Responder's addresses.  However, it MUST
           NOT send to more than three (3) addresses in parallel.
           Furthermore, upon timeout, the implementation MUST refrain
           from sending the same I1 packet to multiple addresses. That
           is, if it retries to initialize the connection after
           timeout, it MUST NOT send the I1 packet to more than one
           destination address.  These limitations are placed in order
           to avoid congestion of the network, and potential DoS
           attacks that might happen, e.g., because someone's claim to
           have hundreds or thousands of addresses could generate a
           huge number of I1 messages from the Initiator.
         
</p>
<p>
           As the Responder is not guaranteed to distinguish the
           duplicate I1s it receives at several of its addresses
           (because it avoids storing states when it answers back an
           R1), the Initiator may receive several duplicate R1s.
         
</p>
<p>
           The Initiator SHOULD then select the initial preferred
           destination address using the source address of the
           selected received R1, and use the preferred address as a
           source address for the I2.  Processing rules for received
           R1s are discussed in <a class='info' href='#inr1'>Section&nbsp;6.8<span> (</span><span class='info'>Processing Incoming R1 Packets</span><span>)</span></a>.

Processing Incoming ICMP Protocol Unreachable
         Messages</h3>

<p>
           A host may receive an ICMP 'Destination Protocol
           Unreachable' message as a response to sending a HIP I1
           packet.  Such a packet may be an indication that the peer
           does not support HIP, or it may be an attempt to launch an
           attack by making the Initiator believe that the Responder
           does not support HIP.
         
</p>
<p>
           When a system receives an ICMP 'Destination Protocol
           Unreachable' message while it is waiting for an R1, it MUST
           NOT terminate the wait.  It MAY continue as if it had not
           received the ICMP message, and send a few more I1s.
           Alternatively, it MAY take the ICMP message as a hint that
           the peer most probably does not support HIP, and return to
           state UNASSOCIATED earlier than otherwise.  However, at
           minimum, it MUST continue waiting for an R1 for a
           reasonable time before returning to UNASSOCIATED.

Processing Incoming I1 Packets</h3>

<p>
         An implementation SHOULD reply to an I1 with an R1 packet,
         unless the implementation is unable or unwilling to set up a
         HIP association.  If the implementation is unable to set up a
         HIP association, the host SHOULD send an ICMP Destination
         Protocol Unreachable, Administratively Prohibited, message to
         the I1 source address.  If the implementation is unwilling to
         set up a HIP association, the host MAY ignore the I1.  This
         latter case may occur during a DoS attack such as an I1
         flood.
       
</p>
<p>
         The implementation MUST be able to handle a storm of received
         I1 packets, discarding those with common content that arrive
         within a small time delta.
       
</p>
<p>
         A spoofed I1 can result in an R1 attack on a system.  An R1
         sender MUST have a mechanism to rate-limit R1s to an address.
       
</p>
<p>
         It is RECOMMENDED that the HIP state machine does not transition
         upon sending an R1.
       
</p>
<p>
         The following steps define the conceptual processing rules
         for responding to an I1 packet:

         </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>
             The Responder MUST check that the Responder's HIT in the
             received I1 is either one of its own HITs or NULL.
           
</li>
<li>
             If the Responder is in ESTABLISHED state, the Responder
             MAY respond to this with an R1 packet, prepare to drop
             existing SAs, and stay at ESTABLISHED state.
           
</li>
<li>
             If the Responder is in I1-SENT state, it must make a
             comparison between the sender's HIT and its own (i.e.,
             the receiver's) HIT.  If the sender's HIT is greater than
             its own HIT, it should drop the I1 and stay at I1-SENT.
             If the sender's HIT is smaller than its own HIT, it
             should send R1 and stay at I1-SENT.  The HIT comparison
             goes similarly as in <a class='info' href='#keymat'>Section&nbsp;6.5<span> (</span><span class='info'>HIP KEYMAT Generation</span><span>)</span></a>.
           
</li>
<li>
             If the implementation chooses to respond to the I1 with
             an R1 packet, it creates a new R1 or selects a
             precomputed R1 according to the format described in <a class='info' href='#R1'>Section&nbsp;5.3.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>R1 - the HIP Responder Packet</span><span>)</span></a>. It creates or chooses an R1 that contains
             its most preferred DH public value that is also contained
             in the DH_GROUP_LIST in the I1 packet. If no suitable DH
             Group ID was contained in the DH_GROUP_LIST in the I1
             packet, it sends an R1 with an arbitrary DH public key.
           
</li>
<li>
             The R1 MUST contain the received Responder's HIT, unless
             the received HIT is NULL, in which case the Responder
             SHOULD select a HIT that is constructed with the MUST
             algorithm in <a class='info' href='#HI'>Section&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Host Identifier (HI) and Its Structure</span><span>)</span></a>, which is currently RSA.
             Other than that, selecting the HIT is a local policy
             matter.
           
</li>

R1 Management</h3>

<p>
           All compliant implementations MUST produce R1 packets.  An
           R1 packet MAY be precomputed.  An R1 packet MAY be reused
           for time Delta T, which is implementation dependent, and
           SHOULD be deprecated and not used once a valid response I2
           packet has been received from an Initiator.  During an I1
           message storm, an R1 packet may be re-used beyond this
           limit.  R1 information MUST NOT be discarded until Delta S
           after T. &nbsp;Time S is the delay needed for the last I2
           to arrive back to the Responder.
         
</p>
<p>
           
           Implementations that support multiple DH groups MAY
           pre-compute R1 packets for each supported group so that

Processing Incoming R1 Packets</h3>

<p>
         A system receiving an R1 MUST first check to see if it has
         sent an I1 to the originator of the R1 (i.e., it is in state
         I1-SENT).  If so, it SHOULD process the R1 as described
         below, send an I2, and go to state I2-SENT, setting a timer
         to protect the I2.  If the system is in state I2-SENT, it MAY
         respond to an R1 if the R1 has a larger R1 generation
         counter; if so, it should drop its state due to processing
         the previous R1 and start over from state I1-SENT.  If the
         system is in any other state with respect to that host, it
         SHOULD silently drop the R1.
       
</p>
<p>
         When sending multiple I1s, an Initiator SHOULD wait for a
         small amount of time after the first R1 reception to allow
         possibly multiple R1s to arrive, and it SHOULD respond to an
         R1 among the set with the largest R1 generation counter.
       
</p>
<p>
         The following steps define the conceptual processing rules
         for responding to an R1 packet:

         </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>
             A system receiving an R1 MUST first check to see if it
             has sent an I1 to the originator of the R1 (i.e., it has
             a HIP association that is in state I1-SENT and that is
             associated with the HITs in the R1).  Unless the I1 was
             sent in opportunistic mode (see <a class='info' href='#op_mode'>Section&nbsp;4.1.8<span> (</span><span class='info'>HIP Opportunistic Mode</span><span>)</span></a>), the IP addresses in the received R1 packet SHOULD be
             ignored and, when looking up the right HIP association,
             the received R1 SHOULD be matched against the
             associations using only the HITs.  If a match exists, the
             system should process the R1 as described below.
           
</li>
<li>
             Otherwise, if the system is in any other state than
             I1-SENT or I2-SENT with respect to the HITs included in
             the R1, it SHOULD silently drop the R1 and remain in the
             current state.
           
</li>
<li>
             If the HIP association state is I1-SENT or I2-SENT, the
             received Initiator's HIT MUST correspond to the HIT used
             in the original, and the I1 and the Responder's HIT MUST
             correspond to the one used, unless the I1 contained a
             NULL HIT.
           
</li>
<li>
             The system SHOULD validate the R1 signature before
             applying further packet processing, according to <a class='info' href='#HIP_SIGNATURE_2'>Section&nbsp;5.2.14<span> (</span><span class='info'>HIP_SIGNATURE_2</span><span>)</span></a>.
           
</li>
<li>
             If the HIP association state is I1-SENT, and multiple
             valid R1s are present, the system MUST select from among
             the R1s with the largest R1 generation counter.
           
</li>
<li>
             The system MUST check that the Initiator HIT Suite is
             contained in the HIT_SUITE_LIST parameter in the R1
             packet (i.e., the Initiator's HIT Suite is supported by the
             Responder).  If the HIT Suite is supported by the
             Responder, the system proceeds normally. Otherwise, the
             system MAY stay in state I1-sent and restart the BEX by
             sending a new I1 packet with a Initiator HIT that is
             supported by the Responder and hence is contained in the
             HIT_SUITE_LIST in the R1 packet.  The system MAY abort
             the BEX if no suitable source HIT is available. The
             system SHOULD wait for acceptable time span to allow
             further R1 packets with higher R1 generation counters to
             arrive before restarting or aborting the BEX.
           
</li>
<li>
             The system MUST check that the DH Group ID in the DH
             parameter in the R1 matches the first DH Suite ID in the
             Responder's DH_GROUP_LIST in the R1 that was also
             contained in the Initiator's DH_GROUP_LIST in the I1.  If
             the two DH Group ID of the DH parameter does not express
             the Responder's best choice, the Initiator can conclude
             that the DH_GROUP_LIST in the I1 was adversely modified.
             In such case, the Initiator MAY send a new I1 packet,
             however, it SHOULD not change its preference in the
             DH_GROUP_LIST in the new I1.  Alternatively, the
             Initiator MAY abort the HIP exchange.
           
</li>
<li>
             If the HIP association state is I2-SENT, the system MAY
             reenter state I1-SENT and process the received R1 if it
             has a larger R1 generation counter than the R1 responded
             to previously.
           
</li>
<li>
             The R1 packet may have the A bit set -- in this case,
             the system MAY choose to refuse it by dropping the R1 and
             returning to state UNASSOCIATED.  The system SHOULD consider
             dropping the R1 only if it used a NULL HIT in I1.  If the
             A bit is set, the Responder's HIT is anonymous and should
             not be stored.
           
</li>
<li>
             The system SHOULD attempt to validate the HIT against the
             received Host Identity by using the received Host
             Identity to construct a HIT and verify that it matches
             the Sender's HIT.
           
</li>
<li>
             The system MUST store the received R1 generation counter
             for future reference.
           
</li>
<li>
             The system attempts to solve the puzzle in R1.  The
             system MUST terminate the search after exceeding the
             remaining lifetime of the puzzle.  If the puzzle is not
             successfully solved, the implementation may either resend
             I1 within the retry bounds or abandon the HIP exchange.
           
</li>
<li>
             The system computes standard Diffie-Hellman keying
             material according to the public value and Group ID
             provided in the DIFFIE_HELLMAN parameter.  The
             Diffie-Hellman keying material Kij is used for key
             extraction as specified in <a class='info' href='#keymat'>Section&nbsp;6.5<span> (</span><span class='info'>HIP KEYMAT Generation</span><span>)</span></a>.  If
             the received Diffie-Hellman Group ID is not supported,
             the implementation may either resend I1 within the retry
             bounds or abandon the HIP exchange.
           
</li>
<li>
             The system selects the HIP_CIPHER ID from the choices
             presented in the R1 packet and uses the selected values
             subsequently when generating and using encryption keys,
             and when sending the I2.  If the proposed alternatives
             are not acceptable to the system, it may either resend I1
             within the retry bounds or abandon the HIP exchange.
           
</li>
<li>
             The system initializes the remaining variables in the
             associated state, including Update ID counters.

<li>
             The system prepares and sends an I2, as described in

             The system SHOULD start a timer whose timeout value
             should be larger than the worst-case anticipated RTT, and
             MUST increment a timeout counter associated with the I2.
             The sender SHOULD retransmit the I2 upon a timeout and
             restart the timer, up to a maximum of I2_RETRIES_MAX
             tries.

Handling Malformed Messages</h3>

           If an implementation receives a malformed R1 message, it

           would not help, as the sender of the R1 typically doesn't
           have any state.  An implementation SHOULD wait for some

           again by sending a new I1 packet.

Processing Incoming I2 Packets</h3>

<p>
         Upon receipt of an I2, the system MAY perform initial checks
         to determine whether the I2 corresponds to a recent R1 that
         has been sent out, if the Responder keeps such state.  For
         example, the sender could check whether the I2 is from an
         address or HIT that has recently received an R1 from it.  The
         R1 may have had Opaque data included that was echoed back in
         the I2.  If the I2 is considered to be suspect, it MAY be
         silently discarded by the system.
       
</p>
<p>
         Otherwise, the HIP implementation SHOULD process the I2.
         This includes validation of the puzzle solution, generating
         the Diffie-Hellman key, decrypting the Initiator's Host
         Identity, verifying the signature, creating state, and
         finally sending an R2.
       
</p>
<p>
         The following steps define the conceptual processing rules
         for responding to an I2 packet:

         </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>
             The system MAY perform checks to verify that the I2
             corresponds to a recently sent R1.  Such checks are
             implementation dependent.  See <a class='info' href='#resp-cookie'>Appendix&nbsp;A<span> (</span><span class='info'>Using Responder Puzzles</span><span>)</span></a> for a description of an example implementation.
           
</li>
<li>
             The system MUST check that the Responder's HIT
             corresponds to one of its own HITs.
           
</li>
<li>
             The system MUST further check that the Initiator's HIT
             Suite is supported. The Responder SHOULD drop I2 packets
             with unsupported Initiator HITs silently.
           
</li>
<li>
             If the system's state machine is in the R2-SENT state,
             the system MAY check if the newly received I2 is similar
             to the one that triggered moving to R2-SENT.  If so, it
             MAY retransmit a previously sent R2, reset the R2-SENT
             timer, and the state machine stays in R2-SENT.
           
</li>
<li>
             If the system's state machine is in the I2-SENT state,
             the system makes a comparison between its local and
             sender's HITs (similarly as in <a class='info' href='#keymat'>Section&nbsp;6.5<span> (</span><span class='info'>HIP KEYMAT Generation</span><span>)</span></a>).
             If the local HIT is smaller than the sender's HIT, it
             should drop the I2 packet, use the peer Diffie-Hellman
             key and nonce I from the R1 packet received earlier, and
             get the local Diffie-Hellman key and nonce J from the I2
             packet sent to the peer earlier.  Otherwise, the system
             should process the received I2 packet and drop any
             previously derived Diffie-Hellman keying material Kij it
             might have formed upon sending the I2 previously.  The
             peer Diffie-Hellman key and the nonce J are taken from
             the just arrived I2 packet.  The local Diffie-Hellman key
             and the nonce I are the ones that were earlier sent in
             the R1 packet.
           
</li>
<li>
             If the system's state machine is in the I1-SENT state,
             and the HITs in the I2 match those used in the previously
             sent I1, the system uses this received I2 as the basis
             for the HIP association it was trying to form, and stops
             retransmitting I1 (provided that the I2 passes the below
             additional checks).
           
</li>
<li>
             If the system's state machine is in any other state than
             R2-SENT, the system SHOULD check that the echoed R1
             generation counter in I2 is within the acceptable range.
             Implementations MUST accept puzzles from the current
             generation and MAY accept puzzles from earlier
             generations.  If the newly received I2 is outside the
             accepted range, the I2 is stale (perhaps replayed) and
             SHOULD be dropped.
           
</li>
<li>
             The system MUST validate the solution to the puzzle by
             computing the hash described in <a class='info' href='#I2'>Section&nbsp;5.3.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>I2 - the Second HIP Initiator Packet</span><span>)</span></a> using
             the same RHASH algorithm.
           
</li>
<li>
             The I2 MUST have a single value in the HIP_CIPHER
             parameter, which MUST match one of the values offered
             to the Initiator in the R1 packet.
           
</li>
<li>
             The system must derive Diffie-Hellman keying material Kij
             based on the public value and Group ID in the
             DIFFIE_HELLMAN parameter.  This key is used to derive the
             HIP association keys, as described in <a class='info' href='#keymat'>Section&nbsp;6.5<span> (</span><span class='info'>HIP KEYMAT Generation</span><span>)</span></a>.  If the Diffie-Hellman Group ID is
             unsupported, the I2 packet is silently dropped.
           
</li>
<li>
             The encrypted HOST_ID is decrypted by the Initiator
             encryption key defined in <a class='info' href='#keymat'>Section&nbsp;6.5<span> (</span><span class='info'>HIP KEYMAT Generation</span><span>)</span></a>.  If
             the decrypted data is not a HOST_ID parameter, the I2
             packet is silently dropped.
           
</li>
<li>
             The implementation SHOULD also verify that the
             Initiator's HIT in the I2 corresponds to the Host
             Identity sent in the I2. (Note: some middleboxes may not
             able to make this verification.)
           
</li>
<li>
             The system MUST verify the HMAC according to the
             procedures in <a class='info' href='#HIP_MAC'>Section&nbsp;5.2.11<span> (</span><span class='info'>HIP_MAC</span><span>)</span></a>.
           
</li>
<li>
             The system MUST verify the HIP_SIGNATURE according to
             <a class='info' href='#hip-signature'>Section&nbsp;5.2.13<span> (</span><span class='info'>HIP_SIGNATURE</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#I2'>Section&nbsp;5.3.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>I2 - the Second HIP Initiator Packet</span><span>)</span></a>.
           
</li>
<li>
             If the checks above are valid, then the system proceeds
             with further I2 processing; otherwise, it discards the I2
             and its state machine remains in the same state.
           
</li>
<li>
             The I2 packet may have the A bit set -- in this case, the
             system MAY choose to refuse it by dropping the I2 and the
             state machine returns to state UNASSOCIATED.  If the A
             bit is set, the Initiator's HIT is anonymous and should
             not be stored.
           
</li>
<li>
             The system initializes the remaining variables in the
             associated state, including Update ID counters.
           
</li>
<li>
             Upon successful processing of an I2 when the system's
             state machine is in state UNASSOCIATED, I1-SENT, I2-SENT,
             or R2-SENT, an R2 is sent and the system's state machine
             transitions to state R2-SENT.
           
</li>
<li> 
             Upon successful processing of an I2 when the system's
             state machine is in state ESTABLISHED, the old HIP
             association is dropped and a new one is installed, an R2
             is sent, and the system's state machine transitions to
             R2-SENT.
           
</li>
<li>
             Upon the system's state machine transitioning to R2-SENT,
             the system starts a timer.  The state machine transitions
             to ESTABLISHED if some data has been received on the
             incoming HIP association, or an UPDATE packet has been
             received (or some other packet that indicates that the
             peer system's state machine has moved to ESTABLISHED).
             If the timer expires (allowing for maximal
             retransmissions of I2s), the state machine transitions to
             ESTABLISHED.

Sending UPDATE Packets</h3>

<p>
         A host sends an UPDATE packet when it wants to update some
         information related to a HIP association.  There are a number
         of likely situations, e.g., mobility management and rekeying
         of an existing ESP Security Association.  The following
         paragraphs define the conceptual rules for sending an UPDATE
         packet to the peer.  Additional steps can be defined in other
         documents where the UPDATE packet is used.
       
</p>
<p>
         The system first determines whether there are any outstanding
         UPDATE messages that may conflict with the new UPDATE message
         under consideration.  When multiple UPDATEs are outstanding
         (not yet acknowledged), the sender must assume that such
         UPDATEs may be processed in an arbitrary order.  Therefore,
         any new UPDATEs that depend on a previous outstanding UPDATE
         being successfully received and acknowledged MUST be
         postponed until reception of the necessary ACK(s) occurs.
         One way to prevent any conflicts is to only allow one
         outstanding UPDATE at a time. However, allowing multiple
         UPDATEs may improve the performance of mobility and
         multihoming protocols.
       
</p>
<p>
         The following steps define the conceptual processing rules
         for sending UPDATE packets.
       
</p>
<p>
         </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>
             The first UPDATE packet is sent with Update ID of zero.
             Otherwise, the system increments its own Update ID value
             by one before continuing the below steps.
           
</li>
<li>
             The system creates an UPDATE packet that contains a SEQ
             parameter with the current value of Update ID.  The
             UPDATE packet may also include an ACK of the peer's
             Update ID found in a received UPDATE SEQ parameter, if
             any.
           
</li>
<li>
             The system sends the created UPDATE packet and starts an
             UPDATE timer.  The default value for the timer is 2 *
             RTT estimate.  If multiple UPDATEs are outstanding,
             multiple timers are in effect.
           
</li>
<li>
             If the UPDATE timer expires, the UPDATE is resent.  The
             UPDATE can be resent UPDATE_RETRY_MAX times.  The UPDATE
             timer SHOULD be exponentially backed off for subsequent
             retransmissions.  If no acknowledgment is received from
             the peer after UPDATE_RETRY_MAX times, the HIP
             association is considered to be broken and the state
             machine should move from state ESTABLISHED to state
             CLOSING as depicted in <a class='info' href='#hipstates'>Section&nbsp;4.4.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Simplified HIP State Diagram</span><span>)</span></a>.  The
             UPDATE timer is cancelled upon receiving an ACK from the
             peer that acknowledges receipt of the UPDATE.

Receiving UPDATE Packets</h3>

<p>
         When a system receives an UPDATE packet, its processing
         depends on the state of the HIP association and the presence
         and values of the SEQ and ACK parameters.  Typically, an
         UPDATE message also carries optional parameters whose
         handling is defined in separate documents.
       
</p>
<p>
         For each association, the peer's next expected in-sequence
         Update ID ("peer Update ID") is stored.  Initially, this
         value is zero.  Update ID comparisons of "less than" and
         "greater than" are performed with respect to a circular
         sequence number space.

         The sender may send multiple outstanding UPDATE messages.
         These messages are processed in the order in which they are
         received at the receiver (i.e., no resequencing is
         performed).  When processing UPDATEs out-of-order, the
         receiver MUST keep track of which UPDATEs were previously
         processed, so that duplicates or retransmissions are ACKed
         and not reprocessed.  A receiver MAY choose to define a
         receive window of Update IDs that it is willing to process at
         any given time, and discard received UPDATEs falling outside
         of that window.

Handling a SEQ Parameter in a Received UPDATE Message</h3>

<p>

               If the Update ID in the received SEQ is not the next
               in the sequence of Update IDs and is greater than the
               receiver's window for new UPDATEs, the packet MUST be
               dropped.
             
</li>
<li>
               If the Update ID in the received SEQ corresponds to an
               UPDATE that has recently been processed, the packet is
               treated as a retransmission.  The HIP_MAC verification
               (next step) MUST NOT be skipped.  (A byte-by-byte
               comparison of the received and a stored packet would be
               OK, though.)  It is recommended that a host cache
               UPDATE packets sent with ACKs to avoid the cost of
               generating a new ACK packet to respond to a replayed
               UPDATE.  The system MUST acknowledge, again, such
               (apparent) UPDATE message retransmissions but SHOULD
               also consider rate-limiting such retransmission
               responses to guard against replay attacks.

<li>
               If a new SEQ parameter is being processed, the

               An UPDATE acknowledgment packet with ACK parameter is

Processing CLOSE Packets</h3>

<p>
         When the host receives a CLOSE message, it responds with a
         CLOSE_ACK message and moves to CLOSED state.  (The
         authenticity of the CLOSE message is verified using both
         HIP_MAC and SIGNATURE).  This processing applies whether or
         not the HIP association state is CLOSING in order to handle
         CLOSE messages from both ends that cross in flight.
       
</p>
<p>
         The HIP association is not discarded before the host moves
         from the UNASSOCIATED state.
       
</p>
<p>
         Once the closing process has started, any need to send data
         packets will trigger creating and establishing of a new HIP
         association, starting with sending an I1.
       
</p>
<p>
         If there is no corresponding HIP association, the CLOSE packet
         is dropped.

Processing CLOSE_ACK Packets</h3>

<p>
         When a host receives a CLOSE_ACK message, it verifies that it

         The CLOSE_ACK uses HIP_MAC and SIGNATURE for verification.

         Problem to an incoming CLOSE message (see <a class='info' href='#non-existing-hip'>Section&nbsp;5.4.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Non-Existing HIP Association</span><span>)</span></a>).

         the keying material.  That is, the state SHOULD NOT be stored
         on stable storage.  If the implementation does drop the state
         (as RECOMMENDED), it MUST also drop the peer's R1 generation
         counter value, unless a local policy explicitly defines that
         the value of that particular host is stored.  An
         implementation MUST NOT store R1 generation counters by
         default, but storing R1 generation counter values, if done,
         MUST be configured by explicit HITs.

<a name="rfc.section.7"></a><h3>7.&nbsp;
HIP Policies</h3>

<p>
       There are a number of variables that will influence the HIP
       exchanges that each host must support.  All HIP implementations
       MUST support more than one simultaneous HI, at least one of
       which SHOULD be reserved for anonymous usage.  Although
       anonymous HIs will be rarely used as Responders' HIs, they will
       be common for Initiators.  Support for more than two HIs is
       RECOMMENDED.
     
</p>
<p>
       Many Initiators would want to use a different HI for different
       Responders.  The implementations SHOULD provide for an ACL of
       Initiator's HIT to Responder's HIT.  This ACL SHOULD also
       include preferred transform and local lifetimes.
     
</p>
<p>
       The value of K used in the HIP R1 packet can also vary by
       policy.  K should never be greater than 20, but for trusted
       partners it could be as low as 0.
     
</p>
<p>
       Responders would need a similar ACL, representing which hosts
       they accept HIP exchanges, and the preferred transform and
       local lifetimes.  Wildcarding SHOULD be supported for this ACL
       also.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>
       HIP is designed to provide secure authentication of hosts.  HIP
       also attempts to limit the exposure of the host to various
       denial-of-service and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.  In so
       doing, HIP itself is subject to its own DoS and MitM attacks
       that potentially could be more damaging to a host's ability to
       conduct business as usual.
     
</p>
<p>
       Denial-of-service attacks often take advantage of the cost of
       start of state for a protocol on the Responder compared to the
       'cheapness' on the Initiator.  HIP makes no attempt to increase
       the cost of the start of state on the Initiator, but makes an
       effort to reduce the cost to the Responder.  This is done by
       having the Responder start the 3-way exchange instead of the
       Initiator, making the HIP protocol 4 packets long.  In doing
       this, packet 2 becomes a 'stock' packet that the Responder MAY
       use many times, until some Initiator has provided a valid
       response to such an R1 packet.  During an I1 storm, the host
       may reuse the same DH value also even if some Initiator has
       provided a valid response using that particular DH value.
       However, such behavior is discouraged and should be avoided.
       Using the same Diffie-Hellman values and random puzzle #I value
       has some risks.  This risk needs to be balanced against a
       potential storm of HIP I1 packets.
     
</p>
<p>
       This shifting of the start of state cost to the Initiator in
       creating the I2 HIP packet, presents another DoS attack.  The
       attacker spoofs the I1 HIP packet and the Responder sends out
       the R1 HIP packet.  This could conceivably tie up the
       'Initiator' with evaluating the R1 HIP packet, and creating the
       I2 HIP packet.  The defense against this attack is to simply
       ignore any R1 packet where a corresponding I1 was not sent.
     
</p>
<p>
       A second form of DoS attack arrives in the I2 HIP packet.  Once
       the attacking Initiator has solved the puzzle, it can send
       packets with spoofed IP source addresses with either an invalid
       encrypted HIP payload component or a bad HIP signature.  This
       would take resources in the Responder's part to reach the point
       to discover that the I2 packet cannot be completely processed.
       The defense against this attack is after N bad I2 packets, the
       Responder would discard any I2s that contain the given
       Initiator HIT.  This will shut down the attack.  The attacker
       would have to request another R1 and use that to launch a new
       attack.  The Responder could up the value of K while under
       attack.  On the downside, valid I2s might get dropped too.
     
</p>
<p>
       A third form of DoS attack is emulating the restart of state
       after a reboot of one of the partners.  A restarting host would
       send an I1 to a peer, which would respond with an R1 even if it
       were in the ESTABLISHED state.  If the I1 were spoofed, the
       resulting R1 would be received unexpectedly by the spoofed host
       and would be dropped, as in the first case above.
     
</p>
<p>
       A fourth form of DoS attack is emulating the end of state.  HIP
       relies on timers plus a CLOSE/CLOSE_ACK handshake to explicitly
       signal the end of a HIP association.  Because both CLOSE and
       CLOSE_ACK messages contain an HIP_MAC, an outsider cannot close
       a connection.  The presence of an additional SIGNATURE allows
       middleboxes to inspect these messages and discard the
       associated state (for e.g., firewalling, SPI-based NATing,
       etc.).  However, the optional behavior of replying to CLOSE
       with an ICMP Parameter Problem packet (as described in <a class='info' href='#non-existing-hip'>Section&nbsp;5.4.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Non-Existing HIP Association</span><span>)</span></a>) might allow an IP spoofer sending
       CLOSE messages to launch reflection attacks.
     
</p>
<p>
       A fifth form of DoS attack is replaying R1s to cause the
       Initiator to solve stale puzzles and become out of
       synchronization with the Responder.  The R1 generation counter
       is a monotonically increasing counter designed to protect
       against this attack, as described in <a class='info' href='#hip-replay'>Section&nbsp;4.1.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>HIP Replay Protection</span><span>)</span></a>.
     
</p>
<p>
       Man-in-the-middle attacks are difficult to defend against,
       without third-party authentication.  A skillful MitM could
       easily handle all parts of HIP, but HIP indirectly provides the
       following protection from a MitM attack.  If the Responder's HI
       is retrieved from a signed DNS zone, a certificate, or through
       some other secure means, the Initiator can use this to validate
       the R1 HIP packet.
     
</p>
<p>
       Likewise, if the Initiator's HI is in a secure DNS zone, a
       trusted certificate, or otherwise securely available, the
       Responder can retrieve the HI (after having got the I2 HIP
       packet) and verify that the HI indeed can be trusted.  However,
       since an Initiator may choose to use an anonymous HI, it
       knowingly risks a MitM attack.  The Responder may choose not to
       accept a HIP exchange with an anonymous Initiator.
     
</p>
<p>
       The HIP Opportunistic Mode concept has been introduced in this
       document, but this document does not specify what the semantics
       of such a connection setup are for applications. There are
       certain concerns with opportunistic mode, as discussed in <a class='info' href='#op_mode'>Section&nbsp;4.1.8<span> (</span><span class='info'>HIP Opportunistic Mode</span><span>)</span></a>.
     
</p>
<p>
       NOTIFY messages are used only for informational purposes and
       they are unacknowledged.  A HIP implementation cannot rely
       solely on the information received in a NOTIFY message because
       the packet may have been replayed.  It SHOULD NOT change any
       state information based purely on a received NOTIFY message.
     
</p>
<p>
       Since not all hosts will ever support HIP, ICMP 'Destination
       Protocol Unreachable' messages are to be expected and present a
       DoS attack.  Against an Initiator, the attack would look like
       the Responder does not support HIP, but shortly after receiving
       the ICMP message, the Initiator would receive a valid R1 HIP
       packet.  Thus, to protect from this attack, an Initiator should
       not react to an ICMP message until a reasonable delta time to
       get the real Responder's R1 HIP packet.  A similar attack
       against the Responder is more involved.  Normally, if an I1
       message received by a Responder was a bogus one sent by an
       attacker, the Responder may receive an ICMP message from the IP
       address the R1 message was sent to.  However, a sophisticated
       attacker can try to take advantage of such a behavior and try
       to break up the HIP exchange by sending such an ICMP message to
       the Responder before the Initiator has a chance to send a valid
       I2 message.  Hence, the Responder SHOULD NOT act on such an
       ICMP message.  Especially, it SHOULD NOT remove any minimal
       state created when it sent the R1 HIP packet (if it did create
       one), but wait for either a valid I2 HIP packet or the natural
       timeout (that is, if R1 packets are tracked at all).  Likewise,
       the Initiator should ignore any ICMP message while waiting for
       an R2 HIP packet, and should delete any pending state only
       after a natural timeout.

<dt>HIP Version</dt>
<dd><br />

           The four-bit Version field in a HIP protocol packet
           describes the version of the HIP protocol. It is defined in
           <a class='info' href='#ssec-payload'>Section&nbsp;5.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Payload Format</span><span>)</span></a>. The currently defined values
           are 1 and 2. The version of this document is 2.  New values
           are assigned through IETF Consensus.
</dd>
<dt>HIT Suite</dt>
<dd><br />

           The four-bit HIT Suite ID uses the OGA field in the ORCHID
           to express the type of the HIT. This document defines two
           HIT Suites.

           <br />
<br />


           The HIT Suite ID is also carried in the four higher-order
           bits of the ID field in the HIT_SUITE_LIST parameter. The
           four lower-order bits are reserved for future extensions of
           the HIT Suite ID space beyond 16 values.

           <br />
<br />


           At the time being, the HIT Suite uses only four bits
           because these bits have to be carried in the HIT. Using
           more bits for the HIT Suite ID reduces the cryptographic
           strength of the HIT. HIT Suite IDs must be allocated
           carefully to avoid namespace exhaustion. Moreover,
           deprecated IDs should be reused after an appropriate time
           span. If 16 Suite IDs prove insufficient and more HIT Suite
           IDs are needed concurrently, more bits can be used for the
           HIT Suite ID by using one HIT Suite ID (0) to indicate that
           more bits should be used.  The HIT_SUITE_LIST parameter
           already supports 8-bit HIT Suite IDs, should longer IDs be
           needed. Possible extensions of the HIT Suite ID space to
           eight-bit and new HIT Suite IDs are defined through IETF
           Consensus.
         
</dd>
<dt>Parameter Type</dt>
<dd><br />

           The 16-bit Type field in a HIP parameter describes the type
           of the parameter. It is defined in <a class='info' href='#tlvformat'>Section&nbsp;5.2.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>TLV Format</span><span>)</span></a>. The current values are defined in

           With the exception of the assigned Type codes, the Type
           codes 0 through 1023 and 61440 through 65535 are reserved

           The Type codes 32768 through 49141 are reserved for
           experimentation. Types SHOULD be selected in a random
           fashion from this range, thereby reducing the probability
           of collisions. A method employing genuine randomness (such
           as flipping a coin) SHOULD be used.

<p>
       The drive to create HIP came to being after attending the
       MALLOC meeting at the 43rd IETF meeting.  Baiju Patel and
       Hilarie Orman really gave the original author, Bob Moskowitz,
       the assist to get HIP beyond 5 paragraphs of ideas.  It has
       matured considerably since the early versions thanks to
       extensive input from IETFers.  Most importantly, its design
       goals are articulated and are different from other efforts in
       this direction.  Particular mention goes to the members of the
       NameSpace Research Group of the IRTF.  Noel Chiappa provided
       valuable input at early stages of discussions about identifier
       handling and Keith Moore the impetus to provide resolvability.
       Steve Deering provided encouragement to keep working, as a
       solid proposal can act as a proof of ideas for a research
       group.
     
</p>
<p>
       Many others contributed; extensive security tips were provided
       by Steve Bellovin.  Rob Austein kept the DNS parts on track.
       Paul Kocher taught Bob Moskowitz how to make the puzzle
       exchange expensive for the Initiator to respond, but easy for
       the Responder to validate.  Bill Sommerfeld supplied the
       Birthday concept, which later evolved into the R1 generation
       counter, to simplify reboot management.  Erik Nordmark supplied
       the CLOSE-mechanism for closing connections.  Rodney Thayer and
       Hugh Daniels provided extensive feedback.  In the early times
       of this document, John Gilmore kept Bob Moskowitz challenged to
       provide something of value.
     
</p>
<p>
       During the later stages of this document, when the editing
       baton was transferred to Pekka Nikander, the input from the
       early implementors was invaluable.  Without having actual
       implementations, this document would not be on the level it is
       now.
     
</p>
<p>
       In the usual IETF fashion, a large number of people have
       contributed to the actual text or ideas.  The list of these
       people include Jeff Ahrenholz, Francis Dupont, Derek Fawcus,
       George Gross, Andrew McGregor, Julien Laganier, Miika Komu,
       Mika Kousa, Jan Melen, Henrik Petander, Michael Richardson,
       Rene Hummen, Tim Shepard, Jorma Wall, and Jukka Ylitalo.  Our
       apologies to anyone whose name is missing.
     
</p>
<p>
       Once the HIP Working Group was founded in early 2004, a number
       of changes were introduced through the working group process.
       Most notably, the original document was split in two, one
       containing the base exchange and the other one defining how to
       use ESP.  Some modifications to the protocol proposed by Aura,
       et al., <a class='info' href='#AUR03'>[AUR03]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Aura, T., Nagarajan, A., and A. Gurtov, &ldquo;Analysis of the HIP Base Exchange Protocol,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> were added at a later stage.

<a name="rfc.section.A"></a><h3>Appendix A.&nbsp;
Using Responder Puzzles</h3>

<p>
       As mentioned in <a class='info' href='#hip-cookie'>Section&nbsp;4.1.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>HIP Puzzle Mechanism</span><span>)</span></a>, the Responder may
       delay state creation and still reject most spoofed I2s by using
       a number of pre-calculated R1s and a local selection function.
       This appendix defines one possible implementation in detail.
       The purpose of this appendix is to give the implementors an
       idea on how to implement the mechanism.  If the implementation
       is based on this appendix, it MAY contain some local
       modification that makes an attacker's task harder.
     
</p>
<p>
       The Responder creates a secret value S, that it regenerates
       periodically.  The Responder needs to remember the two latest
       values of S. &nbsp;Each time the S is regenerated, the R1
       generation counter value is incremented by one.
     
</p>
<p>
       The Responder generates a pre-signed R1 packet.  The signature
       for pre-generated R1s must be recalculated when the
       Diffie-Hellman key is recomputed or when the R1_COUNTER value
       changes due to S value regeneration.
     
</p>
<p>
       When the Initiator sends the I1 packet for initializing a
       connection, the Responder gets the HIT and IP address from the
       packet, and generates an I value for the puzzle.  The I value
       is set to the pre-signed R1 packet.
     
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
    I value calculation:
    I = Ltrunc( RHASH ( S | HIT-I | HIT-R | IP-I | IP-R ), n)
    where n = RHASH-len/2
</pre></div>
<p>
       The RHASH algorithm is the same that is used to generate
       the Responder's HIT value.
     
</p>
<p>
       From an incoming I2 packet, the Responder gets the required
       information to validate the puzzle: HITs, IP addresses, and the
       information of the used S value from the R1_COUNTER. Using
       these values, the Responder can regenerate the I, and verify it
       against the I received in the I2 packet.  If the I values
       match, it can verify the solution using I, J, and difficulty K.
       If the I values do not match, the I2 is dropped.
     
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
    puzzle_check:
    V := Ltrunc( RHASH( I2.I | I2.hit_i | I2.hit_r | I2.J ), K )
    if V != 0, drop the packet
</pre></div>
<p>
       If the puzzle solution is correct, the I and J values are
       stored for later use.  They are used as input material when
       keying material is generated.
     
</p>
<p>
       Keeping state about failed puzzle solutions depends on the
       implementation.  Although it is possible for the Responder not
       to keep any state information, it still may do so to protect
       itself against certain attacks (see <a class='info' href='#hip-cookie'>Section&nbsp;4.1.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>HIP Puzzle Mechanism</span><span>)</span></a>).

Example Checksums for HIP Packets</h3>

<p>
       The HIP checksum for HIP packets is specified in <a class='info' href='#ssec-crc'>Section&nbsp;5.1.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Checksum</span><span>)</span></a>.  Checksums for TCP and UDP packets
       running over HIP-enabled security associations are specified in
       Section 3.5.  The examples below use IP addresses of
       192.168.0.1 and 192.168.0.2 (and their respective
       IPv4-compatible IPv6 formats), and HITs with the prefix of
       2001:10  followed by zeros, followed by a decimal 1 or 2,
       respectively.
     
</p>
<p>
       The following example is defined only for testing a checksum
       calculation.  The address format for the IPv4-compatible IPv6
       address is not a valid one, but using these IPv6 addresses when
       testing an IPv6 implementation gives the same checksum output
       as an IPv4 implementation with the corresponding IPv4
       addresses.

HIT Suites and HIT Generation</h3>

<p>
       The HIT as an ORCHID <a class='info' href='#RFC4843-bis'>[RFC4843&#8209;bis]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nikander, P., Laganier, J., and F. Dupont, &ldquo;STUB: An IPv6 Prefix for Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash Identifiers (ORCHID),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> consists of
       three parts: A 28-bit prefix, a 4-bit encoding of the ORCHID
       generation algorithm (OGA) and the representation of the public
       key. The OGA is an index pointing to the specific algorithm by
       which the public key and the 96-bit hashed encoding is
       generated. The OGA is protocol specific and is to be
       interpreted as defined below for all protocols that use the
       same context ID as HIP. HIP groups sets of valid combinations
       of signature and hash algorithms into HIT Suites.  These HIT
       suites are addressed by an index, which is transmitted in the
       OGA field of the ORCHID.
     
</p>
<p>
       The set of used HIT Suites will be extended to counter the
       progress in computation capabilities and vulnerabilities in the
       employed algorithms. The intended use of the HIT Suites is to
       introduce a new HIT Suite and phase out an old one before it
       becomes insecure.  Since the 4-bit OGA field only permits 15
       HIT Suites (the HIT Suite with ID 0 is reserved) to be used in
       parallel, phased-out HIT Suites  must be reused at some point.
       In such a case, there will be a rollover of the HIT Suite ID
       and the next newly introduced HIT Suite will start with a lower
       HIT Suite index than the previoulsy introduced one.  The
       rollover effectively deprecates the reused HIT Suite. For a
       smooth transition, the HIT Suite should be deprecated a
       considerable time before the HIT Suite index is reused.
     
</p>
<p>
       Since the number of HIT Suites is tightly limited to 16, the
       HIT Suites must be assigned carefully. Hence, sets of suitable
       algorithms are grouped in a HIT Suite.
     
</p>
<p>
       The HIT Suite of the Responder's HIT determines the RHASH and
       the hash function to be used for the HMAC in HIP control
       packets as well as the signature algorithm family used for
       generating the HI.  The list of HIT Suites is defined in
       <a class='info' href='#table_hit_suites'>Table&nbsp;11<span> (</span><span class='info'>HIT Suites</span><span>)</span></a>.
     
</p>
<p>
       The following HIT Suites are defined for HIT generation. The
       input for each generation algorithm is the encoding of the HI
       as defined in <a class='info' href='#gener_hit'>Section&nbsp;3.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Generating a HIT from an HI</span><span>)</span></a>. The output is 96
       bits long and is directly used in the ORCHID.
