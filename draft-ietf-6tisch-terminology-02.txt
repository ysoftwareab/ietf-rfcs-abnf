1.  Introduction

   A new breed of Time Sensitive Networks is being developed to enable
   traffic that is highly sensitive to jitter and quite sensitive to
   latency.  Such traffic is not limited to voice and video, but also
   includes command and control operations such as in industrial
   automation or in-vehicle sensors and actuators.

   At IEEE802.1, the "Audio/Video Task Group", was renamed TSN for Time
   Sensitive Networking.  The IEEE802.15.4 Medium Access Control (MAC)
   has evolved with IEEE802.15.4e which provides in particular the Time
   Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode for industrial-type applications.
   Both provide deterministic capabilities to the point that a packet
   that pertains to a certain flow crosses the network from node to node
   following a very precise schedule, like a train leaves intermediate
   stations at precise times along its path.

   This document provides additional terminology elements to cover terms
   that are new to the context of TSCH wireless networks and other
   deterministic networks.

2.  Terminology

   The draft extends [I-D.ietf-roll-terminology] and use terms from RFC
   6550 [RFC6550] and RFC 6552 [RFC6552], which are all included here by
   reference.

   The draft does not reuse terms from IEEE802.15.4e such as "path" or
   "link" which bear a meaning that is quite different from classical
   IETF parlance.

   This document adds the following terms:

   6TiSCH:     IPv6 over the Timeslotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode of
               IEEE 802.15.4e.  It defines the 6top sublayer and a set
               of protocols (in particular, for setting up a schedule
               with a centralized or distributed approach, managing the
               resource allocation), as well as the architecture to bind
               them together, for use in IPv6 TSCH based networks.

   6F:         IPv6 Forwarding.  One of the three forwarding models
               supported by 6TiSCH.  Packets are routed at layer 3,
               where Quality of Service (QoS) and Random Early Detection
               (RED) [RFC2309] operations are expected to prioritize
               flows with differentiated services.

   6top:       6top is the adaptation sublayer between TSCH and upper
               layers like 6LoWPAN and RPL.  It is defined in
               [I-D.wang-6tisch-6top-sublayer].

   6top Data Convey Model:  Model describing how the 6top adaptation
               layer feeds the data flow coming from upper layers into
               TSCH.  It is composed by an I-MUX module, a MUX module, a
               set of priority queues, and a PDU (Payload Data Unit).See
               [I-D.wang-6tisch-6top-sublayer].

   ASN:        Absolute Slot Number, the total number of timeslots that
               has elapsed since the start of the network or an
               arbitrary start time (i.e., a timeslot counter,
               incremented by one at each timeslot).  It is wide enough
               to not roll over in practice.  See [IEEE802154e].

   Blacklist:  Set of frequencies which should not be used for
               communication.

   BBR:        Backbone Router.  In the 6TiSCH architecture, it is an
               LBR and also a IPv6 ND-efficiency-aware Router (NEAR)
               [I-D.chakrabarti-nordmark-6man-efficient-nd].  It
               performs ND proxy operations between registered devices

               and classical ND devices that are located over the
               backbone.

   Broadcast cell:  A scheduled cell used for broadcast transmission.

   Bundle:     A group of equivalent scheduled cells, i.e. cells
               identified by different [slotOffset, channelOffset],
               which are scheduled for a same purpose, with the same
               neighbor, with the same flags, and the same slotframe.
               The size of the bundle refers to the number of cells it
               contains.  Given the length of the slotframe, the size of
               the bundle translates directly into bandwidth.

   Cell:       A single element in the TSCH schedule, identified by a
               slotOffset, a channelOffset, a slotframeHandle.  A cell
               can be scheduled or unscheduled.

   ChannelOffset:  Identifies a row in the TSCH slotframe.  The number
               of available channelOffsets is equal to the number of
               available frequencies.  The channelOffset translates into
               a frequency when the communication takes place, resulting
               in channel hopping, as detailed in
               [I-D.ietf-6tisch-tsch].

   Channel distribution/usage (CDU) matrix:  : Matrix of height equal to
               the number of available channels (i.e, ChannelOffsets),
               representing the spectrum (channel) distribution among
               the different (RPL parent) nodes in the networks.  Every
               single element of the matrix belongs to a specific chunk.
               It has to be noticed that such matrix, even though it
               includes all the cells grouped in chunks, belonging to
               different slotframes, is different from the TSCH
               schedule.

   Chunk:      A well-known list of cells, well-distributed in time and
               frequency, within a CDU matrix; a chunk represents a
               portion of a CDU matrix that is globally known by all the
               nodes in the network, with typically at most one cell per
               slotOffset for single radio devices.  Once appropriated,
               a chunk can be managed separately by a single node within
               its interference domain.  A node may appropriate multiple
               chunks, and use them according to a specific policy.
               Chunks may overlap.  They can be pre-programmed, or can
               be computed by an external entity at the network
               bootstrap.

   Chunk ownership appropriation:  The process by which an individual
               node obtains a chunk to manage based on peer-to-peer
               interaction with its neighbors.

   Chunk ownership delegation:  The process by which an individual node
               obtains a chunk to manage based on point-to-point
               interaction with an external entity.

   Communication Paradigm:  It is Associated with the Information Model
               [RFC3444] of the state that is exchanged, and indicates:
               the location of that state (e.g., centralized vs.
               distributed, RESTful, etc.), the numbers of parties
               (e.g., P2P vs. P2MP) and the relationship between parties
               (e.g., master/slave vs. peers) at a high level of
               protocol abstraction.  Layer 5 client/server REST is a
               typical communication paradigm, but industrial protocols
               also use publish/subscribe which is P2MP and source/sink
               which is MP2MP and primarily used for alarms and alerts
               at the application layer.  At layer 3, basic flooding,
               P2P synchronization and path-marking (RSVP-like) are
               commonly used paradigms, whereas at layer 2, master/slave
               polling and peer-to-peer forwarding are classical
               examples.

   Dedicated Cell:  A cell that is reserved for a given node to transmit
               to a specific neighbor.

   Distributed cell reservation:  A reservation of a cell done by one or
               more in-network entities (typically a connection
               endpoint).

   Distributed track reservation:  A reservation of a track done by one
               or more in-network entities (typically a connection
               endpoint).

   EB:         Enhanced Beacon frame used by a node to announce the
               presence of the network.  It contains information about
               the timeslot length, the current ASN value, the
               slotframes and timeslots the beaconing mote is listening
               on, and a 1-byte join priority (i.e., number of hops
               separating the node sending the EB, and the PAN
               coordinator).

   FF:         6LoWPAN Fragment Forwarding.  It is one of the three
               forwarding models supported by 6TiSCH.  The 6LoWPAN
               Fragment is used as a label for switching at the 6LoWPAN
               sublayer, as defined in
               [I-D.thubert-roll-forwarding-frags].

Internet-Draft             6tisch-terminology                  July 2014


   GMPLS:      Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching, a 2.5 layer
               service that is used to forward packets based on the
               concept of generalized labels.

   Hard Cell:  A scheduled cell which the 6top sublayer cannot
               reallocate.  See [I-D.wang-6tisch-6top-sublayer].

   Hopping Sequence:  Ordered sequence of frequencies, identified by a
               Hopping_Sequence_ID, used for channel hopping, when
               translating the channel offset value into a frequency
               (i.e., PHY channel).  See [IEEE802154e] and
               [I-D.ietf-6tisch-tsch].

   IE:         Information Elements, a list of Type-Length-Value
               containers placed at the end of the MAC header, used to
               pass data between layers or devices.  A small number of
               types are defined by [IEEE802154e], but a range of types
               is available for extensions, and thus, is exploitable by
               6TiSCH.  See [IEEE802154e].

   I-MUX module:  Inverse-Multiplexer, a classifier that receives
               6LoWPAN frames and places them into priority queues.  See
               [I-D.wang-6tisch-6top-sublayer].

   Interaction Model:  It is a particular way of implementing a
               communication paradigm.  Defined at a lower level of
               abstraction, it includes protocol-specific details such
               as a particular method (e.g., a REST GET) and a Data
               Model for the state to be exchanged.

   KMP:        Key Managment Protocol.

   LBR:        LLN Border Router.  It is an LLN device, usually powered,
               that acts as a Border Router to the outside within the
               6TiSCH architecture.

   Link:       A communication facility or medium over which nodes can
               communicate at the link layer, i.e., the layer
               immediately below IP.  Thus, the IETF parlance for the
               term "Link" is adopted, as opposed to the IEEE802.15.4e
               terminology.  In the context of the 6TiSCH architecture,
               which applies to Low Power Lossy Networks (LLNs), an IPv6
               subnet is usually not congruent to a single link and
               techniques such as IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Proxying are
               used to achieve reachability within the multilink subnet.
               A link is distinct from a track.  In fact, link local
               addresses are not expected to be used over a track for
               end to end communication.  Finally, from the Layer 3

               perspective (where the inner complexities of TSCH
               operations are hidden to enable classical IP routing and
               Forwarding), a single radio interface may be seen as a
               number of Links with different capabilities for unicast
               or multicast services.

   Logical Cell:  A cell that corresponds to granted bandwidth but is
               only lazily associated to a physical cell, based on
               usage.

   MAC:        Medium Access Control.

   MUX module: Multiplexer, the entity that dequeues frames from
               priority queues and associates them to a cell for
               transmission.  See [I-D.wang-6tisch-6top-sublayer].

   NEAR:       Energy Aware Default Router, as defined in
               [I-D.chakrabarti-nordmark-6man-efficient-nd].

   NME:        Network Management Entity, the entity in the network
               managing cells and other device resources.  It may
               cooperate with the PCE.  It interacts with LLN nodes
               through the backbone router.

   PANA:       Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access,
               as defined in [RFC5191] .

   PCE:        Path Computation Element, the entity in the network which
               is responsible for building and maintaining the TSCH
               schedule, when centralized scheduling is used.

   PCE cell reservation:  The reservation of a cell done by the PCE.

   PCE track reservation:  The reservation of a track done by the PCE.

   QoS:        Quality of Service.

   (to) reallocate a cell:  The action operated by the 6top sublayer of
               changing the slotOffset and/or channelOffset of a soft
               cell.

   SA:         Security Association.

   (to) Schedule a cell:  The action of turning an unscheduled cell into
               a scheduled cell.

   Scheduled cell:  A cell which is assigned a neighbor MAC address
               (broadcast address is also possible), and one or more of

               the following flags: TX, RX, shared, timeskeeping.  A
               scheduled cell can be used by the IEEE802.15.4e TSCH
               implementation to communicate.  A scheduled cell can be a
               hard cell or a soft cell.

   Shared Cell:  A cell marked with both the "TX" and "shared" flags.
               This cell can be used by more than one transmitter node.
               A backoff algorithm is used to resolve contention.  See
               [I-D.ietf-6tisch-tsch].

   SlotOffset: Identifies a column in the TSCH schedule, i.e., the
               number of timeslots since the beginning of the current
               iteration of the slotframe.

   Slotframe:  A MAC-level abstraction that is internal to the node and
               contains a series of timeslots of equal length and
               priority.  It is characterized by a slotframe_ID, and a
               slotframe_size.  Multiple slotframes can coexist in a
               node's schedule, i.e., a node can have multiple
               activities scheduled in different slotframes, based on
               the priority of its packets/traffic flows.  The timeslots
               in the Slotframe are indexed by the SlotOffset; the first
               timeslot is at SlotOffset 0.

   Soft Cell:  A scheduled cell which the 6top sublayer can reallocate,
               as described in [I-D.wang-6tisch-6top-sublayer].

   TF:         Track Forwarding.  It is the simplest and fastest
               forwarding model supported by 6TiSCH.  It is a G-MPLS-
               like forwarding model.  The input cell characterizes the
               flow and indicates the output cell.

   Timeslot:   A basic communication unit in TSCH which allows a
               transmitter node to send a frame to a receiver neighbor,
               and that receiver neighbor to optionally send back an
               acknowledgment.

   Time Source Neighbor:  A neighbor a node uses as its time reference,
               and to which it needs to keep its clock synchronized.  A
               node can have one or more time source neighbors.

   Track:      A determined sequence of cells along a multi-hop path.
               It is typically the result of a reservation.  The node
               that initializes the process for establishing a track is
               the owner of the track.  The latter assigns a unique
               identifier to the track, called TrackID.

   TrackID:    Unique identifier of a track, assigned by the owner of
               the track.

   TSCH:       Time Slotted Channel Hopping, a medium access mode of the
               [IEEE802154e] standard which uses time synchronization to
               achieve ultra low-power operation and channel hopping to
               enable high reliability.

   TSCH Schedule:  A matrix of cells, each cell indexed by a slotOffset
               and a channelOffset.  The TSCH schedule contains all the
               scheduled cells from all slotframes and is sufficient to
               qualify the communication in the TSCH network.  The
               "width of the matrix is equal to the number of scheduled
               timeslots in all the concurrent active slotframes.  The
               number of channelOffset values (the "height" of the
               matrix) is equal to the number of available frequencies.

   unscheduled cell:  A cell which is not used by the IEEE802.15.4e TSCH
               implementation.
