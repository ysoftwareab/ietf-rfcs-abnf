Internet-Draft            EFMCu Interfaces MIB                  Aug 2004


1.  Introduction

   New Ethernet like interfaces have been defined in the Institute of
   Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.3ah project a.k.a.
   Ethernet in the First Mile (EFM) [802.3ah].  In particular 2BASE-TL
   and 10PASS-TS physical interfaces (PHYs), defined over voice-grade
   copper pairs, have been specified for the long and short reach
   respectively.  These interfaces, collectively called EFMCu, are based
   on ITU-T G.SHDSL and VDSL specifications and support variable rates
   and optional Physical Medium Entity (PME) aggregation (a.k.a.
   multi-pair bonding).

   2BASE-TL PHY is capable of providing at least 2Mbps over 2700 m long
   single copper pair with a mean Bit Error Rate (BER) of 10^-7 (using
   5dB target noise margin).

   10PASS-TS PHY is capable of providing at least 10Mbps over 750 m long
   single copper pair with a mean BER of 10^-7 (using 6dB target noise
   margin).

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community
   to manage EFMCu interfaces.

   Note that managed objects for Operation, Administration and
   Management (OAM) and Ethernet over Passive Optical Networks (EPON)
   clauses of IEEE 802.3ah are defined in EFM-COMMON-MIB
   [I-D.ietf-hubmib-efm-mib] and EFM-EPON-MIB
   [I-D.ietf-hubmib-efm-epon-mib] respectively.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].  A detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management
   Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Relation to other MIBs

   This section outlines the relationship of this MIB with other MIB
   modules described in the relevant RFCs.  Specifically, Interfaces
   Group MIB (IF-MIB), Ethernet-Like (EtherLike-MIB), MAU (MAU-MIB),
   SHDSL (HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB) and VDSL (VDSL-LINE-EXT-MCM-MIB) are
   discussed.

3.1  Relation to Interfaces Group MIB

   2BASE-TL and 10PASS-TS PHY's specified in this MIB are stacked
   Ethernet interfaces and as such are managed using generic interface
   management objects defined in the IF-MIB [RFC2863].  The stack
   management is done via the ifStackTable, as defined in the IF-MIB
   [RFC2863] and ifInvStackTable, as defined in the
   IF-INVERTED-STACK-MIB [RFC2864].

3.1.1  Layering Model

   An EFMCu interface can aggregate up to 32 Physical Medium Entity
   (PME) sub-layer devices (modems), using so called PME Aggregation
   Function (PAF).

   A generic EFMCu device can have a number of Physical Coding Sublayer
   (PCS) ports, connected to a MAC via Medium Independent Interface
   (MII) at the upper layer, and cross-connected to a number of
   underlying PMEs, with a single PCS per PME relationship, see clause
   61.1 of [802.3ah] for more details.

   Each PME in the aggregated EFMCu port is represented in the Interface
   table (ifTable) as a separate port with ifType of shdsl(169) for
   2BASE-TL or vdsl(97) for 10PASS-TS.  The ifType values are defined in
   [IANAifType-MIB].

   ifSpeed for each PME shall return the actual data bitrate of the
   active PME or a configured bitrate for pre-activated modems (e.g.
   for 2BaseTL PMEs it is a multiple of 64Kbps).  The ifSpeed of the PCS
   is the sum of the current operating data rates of all modems in the
   aggregation group, without the 64/65B encapsulation overhead and PAF
   overhead, but acounting for the Inter-Frame Gaps (IFG).

   The following configuration shall have no frame loss (the test-sets
   are configured to generate 100% of back to back traffic, i.e.
   minimal IFG, at 10Mbps; the EFM interfaces are obviously aggregated)
   ):

   [testset]--10BaseT--[CO]--2BaseTL--[CPE]--10BaseT--[testset]
           ifSpeed=10Mbps ifSpeed=10Mbps  ifSpeed=10Mbps

           ifSpeed=100Mbps ifSpeed=100Mbps  ifSpeed=100Mbps

           Figure 1: Example configuration with no frame loss

   The following figure shows the layering diagram and corresponding use
   of ifTable and ifMauTable:

    -------------+---+-------   -

        Figure 2: Use of ifTable and ifMauTable for EFMCu ports

   The ifStackTable is indexed by the ifIndex values of the aggregated
   EFMCu port (PCS) and the PMEs connected to it.  ifStackTable allows a
   Network Management application to determine which PMEs are connected
   to a particular PCS and change connections (if supported by the
   application).  The ifInvStackTable, being an inverted version of the
   ifStackTable, provides an efficient means for a Network Management
   application to read a subset of the ifStackTable and thereby
   determine which PCS runs on top of a particular PME.

   A new table ifAvailableStackTable defined in this MIB, specifies for
   each PCS a list of PMEs, which can possibly be cross-connected to
   that PCS, determined by the cross-connect capability of the device.
   This table, modeled after ifStackTable, is read only, reflecting
   current cross-connect capability, which can be dynamic in some

   implementations (e.g.  if PMEs are located on a pluggable module and
   the module is pulled out).  Note that PME availability per PCS,
   described by ifAvailableStackTable, can be constrained by other
   parameters, for example by aggregation capacity of a PCS or by the
   PME in question being already connected to another PCS.  So, in order
   to ensure that a particular PME can be connected to the PCS, all
   respective parameters (e.g.  ifAvailableStackTable, ifStackTable and
   efmCuPAFCapacity) SHALL be inspected.

   *EdNote: Add ifInvAvailableStackTable describing which PCS ports can
   be connected to a particular PME. Add it to the
   ifStackCapabilityGroup conformance statement. *

3.1.2  PME Aggregation Function (PAF)

   The PME Aggregation Function (PAF) is OPTIONAL.  Note however that
   the agent is REQUIRED to report on the PAF capability for all EFMCu
   ports (2BASE-TL and 10PASS-TS).

   *EdNote: Add more info.*

3.1.3  Discovery Operation

   The EFMCu ports may optionally support discovery operation, whereby
   PMEs, during initialization, exchange information about their
   respective aggregation groups (PCS).  This information can then be
   used to detect copper missconnections or for an automatic assignment
   of the local PMEs into aggregation groups instead of fixed
   pre-configuration.

   This MIB allows a Network Management application to control EFM
   Discovery mechanism and query its results.  Note that the Discovery
   mechanism can work only if PAF is supported and enabled.

   Two tables are used by Discovery mechanism: ifStackTable and
   ifAvailableStackTable defined.  The following pseudo-code defines an
   example of Discovery and automatic PME assignment for a generic PAF
   enabled multi-PCS EFMCu device, located at Central Office (CO) [Note
   that automatic PME assignment is only shown here for the purposes of
   the example.  Fixed PME pre-assignment or manual assignment may be
   chosen by a particular implementation]:

                 pcs[i].NumPMEs = pcs[i].NumPMEs + 1;
                 // Discover all other currently disconnected PMEs,
                 // attached to the same CPE and connect them to the PCS

                     IF ( r == dc AND
                          pcs[i].NumPMEs < pcs[i].PAFCapacity)
                       { ADD pme[k] TO ifStackTable[pcs[i]];
                         pcs[i].NumPMEs = pcs[i].NumPMEs + 1;
                       }
                   }
               }
             // Discovered all PMEs which lead to the same CPE and
             // connected them to PCS[i]. Go to the next PCS.
             BREAK;
           }
       }
   }

   The SNMP Agent builds efmCuStackTable according to the information
   contained in the Clause 45 PME_Available_register (see [802.3ah]
   61.1.5.3 and 45.2.3.20).

   Adding a PME to the ifStackTable row for a specific PCS, involves
   actual connection of the PME to the PCS, which can be done by
   modifying Clause 45 PME_Aggregate_register (see [802.3ah] 61.1.5.3
   and 45.2.3.21).

   Note that PCS port does not have to be operationally 'down' for the
   connection to succeed.  In fact, a dynamic PME addition (and removal)
   MAY be implemented whith an available PME being initialized first (by
   setting its ifAdminStatus to 'up') and then added to an operationally

   'up' PCS port, by modifying a respective ifStackTable entry.

   It is RECOMMENDED that a removal of the last operationally 'up' PME
   from an operationally 'up' PCS would be rejected by the
   implementation, as this action would completely drop the link.

3.1.4  EFMCu ports initialization

   EFMCu ports being built on top of xDSL technology, require a lengthy
   initialization or 'training' process, before any data can pass.
   During this initialization both ends of a link (peers) work
   cooperatively to achieve required data rate on a particular copper
   pair.  Sometimes, when the copper line is too long or the noise
   environment on the line is too high, that 'training' process may fail
   to achieve a specific target rate with required characteristics.

   The ifAdminStatus object from the IF-MIB, controls the desired state
   of a PCS and a PME port.  Setting this object to 'up' instructs a
   particular PCS or PME to start initialization process, which may take
   tens of seconds for EFMCu ports, especially if PAF is involved.  The
   ifOperStatus object shows the operational state of an interface
   (extended by efmCuPmeOperStatus defined in this MIB for PME
   interfaces).

   A disconnected PME may be initialized by changing the ifAdminState
   from 'down' to 'up'.  Changing the ifAdminState to 'up' on the PCS
   initializes all PMEs connected to that particular PCS.  Note that in
   case of PAF some interfaces may fail to initialize while others
   succeed.  The PCS is considered operationally 'up' if at least one
   PME aggregated by its PAF is operationally 'up'.  When all PMEs
   connected to the PCS are 'down' the PCS SHALL be considered
   operationally 'lowerLayerDown'.  The PCS SHALL be considered
   operationally 'notPresent' if it is not connected to any PME.  The
   PCS/PME interface SHALL remain operationally 'down' during
   initialization.

   The efmCuPmeOperStatus defined in this MIB expands PME's ifOperStatus
   value of 'down' to 'downReady', 'downNotReady' and 'init' values,
   indicating various EFMCu PME specific states.

3.1.5  Usage of ifTable

   Both PME and PCS interfaces of the EFMCu PHY are managed using
   interface specific management objects defined in this MIB and generic
   interface objects from the ifTable of IF-MIB, with all management
   table entries referenced by the interface index ifIndex.

   The following table summarizes EFMCu specific interpretations for

3.2  Relation to SHDSL MIB

   G.SHDSL.bis modems, similar to PME(s) comprising a 2BASE-TL port, are
   described in HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB [I-D.ietf-adslmib-gshdslbis].  Note
   that not all attributes of G.SHDSL modems reflected in
   HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB have adequate management objects (Clause 30
   attributes and Clause 45 registers) in the EFM standard.

   Because of these differences and for the purposes of simplicity,
   unification of attributes common to both 2BASE-TL and 10PASS-TS PMEs
   and name consistency (e.g.  prefixing the 2BASE-TL PME related
   objects with 'efmCuPme2B' instead of 'hdsl2shdsl'), it was decided
   not to reference HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB objects, but define all the
   relevant objects in this MIB.

   However, if some functionality, not available in this MIB, is
   required and supported by the PME, e.g.  performance monitoring,
   relevant HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB groups MAY be included and aplied for

   PMEs of 2BASE-TL subtype.

3.3  Relation to VDSL MIB

   VDSL (DMT) modems, similar to the PME(s) comprising a 10PASS-TS port,
   are described in VDSL-LINE-EXT-MCM-MIB
   [I-D.ietf-adslmib-vdsl-ext-mcm].  Note that not all attributes of
   VDSL modems reflected in VDSL-LINE-EXT-MCM-MIB have adequate
   management objects (Clause 30 attributes and Clause 45 registers) in
   the EFM standard.

   Because of these differences and for the purposes of simplicity,
   unification of attributes common to both 2BASE-TL and 10PASS-TS PMEs
   and name consistency, it was decided not to reference
   VDSL-LINE-EXT-MCM-MIB objects, but define all the relevant objects in
   this MIB.

   However, if some functionality, not available in this MIB, is
   required and supported by the PME, relevant VDSL-LINE-EXT-MCM-MIB
   groups MAY be included and applied for PMEs of 10PASS-TS subtype.

3.4  Relation to Ethernet-Like and MAU MIBs

   The implementation of EtherLike-MIB [RFC3635] and MAU-MIB
   [I-D.ietf-hubmib-rfc3636bis] is REQUIRED for the EFMCu interfaces.

   Two new values of ifMauType (OBJECT-IDENTITIES of dot3MauType) and
   corresponding bit definitions of ifMauTypeListBits
   (IANAifMauTypeListBits) have been defined in the IANA-MAU-TC-MIB
   [I-D.ietf-hubmib-rfc3636bis] for the EFMCu MAUs:

   o  dot3MauType2BaseTL and b2BaseTL - for 2BASE-TL MAU

   o  dot3MauType10PassTS and b10PassTS - for 10PASS-TS MAU

   As an EtherLike interface every EFMCu port (an ifEntry representing a
   consolidation of LLC, MAC and PCS (sub)layers) SHALL return an ifType
   of ethernetCsmacd(6).  While most of the MAU characteristics is not
   applicable to the EFMCu ports (no auto-negotiation, media available,
   false carriers or jabber), they SHALL return an appropriate ifMauType
   (dot3MauType2BaseTL or dot3mauType10PassTS) in order to direct the
   management software to look in the EFM-CU-MIB for the desired
   information.  For example the information on the particular EFMCu
   flavor that an EFMCu port is running is available from
   efmCuOperSubType, defined in this MIB module.

   Since EFMCu PMEs are not EtherLike interfaces, they cannot be
   instantiated as MAU interface objects.

4.  MIB Structure

4.1  Overview

   The main management objects defined in this MIB are split into 2
   groups:

   o  efmCuPort - containing objects for configuration, capabilities,
      status and notifications, common to all EFMCu PHYs.

   o  efmCuPme - containing objects for configuration, capabilities,
      status and notifications of EFMCu PMEs.

   In addition the ifAvailableStackTable is defined at the same level.

   The efmCuPme group in turn contains efmCuPme2B and efmCuPme10P
   groups, which define configuration profiles specific to 2BASE-TL and
   10PASS-TS PMEs respectively as well as PME specific status
   information.

4.2  Configuration Profiles

   Since a managed node can have a large number of EFMCu PHYs,
   provisioning every parameter on every EFMCu PHY may become
   burdensome.  Moreover, most PMEs are provisioned identically with the
   same set of parameters.  To simplify the provisioning process, this
   MIB makes use of configuration profiles, similar to
   HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB and VDSL-LINE-EXT-MCM-MIB.  A profile is a set
   of parameters that can be shared by multiple PME ports using the same
   configuration.

   The configuration profiles are defined in efmCuPme2BConfProfileTable
   and efmCu10PConfProfileTable for 2BASE-TL and 10PASS-TS PMEs
   respectively.  There are 12 predefined standard profiles for 2BASE-TL
   and 22 standard profiles for 10PASS-TS, defined in 802.3ah and
   dedicated for rapid provisioning of EFMCu PHYs in most scenarios.  An
   ability to define new configuration profiles is also provided to
   allow for EFMCu deployment tailored to specific copper environment
   and spectral regulations.

   A specific configuration profile is assigned to a specific PME via
   efmCuPmeAdminProfile object.  Alternatively, by assigning a non-empty
   profile to a PCS port via efmCuAdminProfile, all PMEs connected to
   the PCS port are made to share that profile, which comes in handy
   during configuration of aggregated ports.

4.3  Mapping of IEEE 802.3ah Managed Objects

   This section contains the mapping between managed objects
   (attributes) defined in [802.3ah] Clause 30, and managed objects
   defined in this document and in associated MIB modules, i.e., the
   IF-MIB [RFC2863].

   Note that majority of the objects defined in this MIB do not have
   direct counterparts in Clause 30 and instead refer to Clause 45
   registers.

   *EdNote: It would be a good idea to update Clause 30 of 802.3ah after
   this MIB is approved. I guess this should be done via a maintanence
   request. *

          according to any configuration profile specified in the list.
          An empty list means that each PME in the port is configured

          The value is limited above by 100Mbps as this is the max
          burst rate across MII for EFMCu ports.

          The value between 1 and 100000 indicates that the total data
          rate (ifSpeed) of the EFMCu port after initialization should
          be equal to the target data rate or less, if the target data
          rate cannot be achieved under spectral restrictions specified

          excess capability SHALL be converted to additional SNR margin
          and spread evenly across all active PMEs assigned to the (PCS)
          port.

          The value of 999999 means that the target data rate is not
          fixed and should be set to the maximum attainable rate during
          initialization (Best Effort), under specified spectral
          restrictions and with desired SNR Margin.

6.  Security Considerations

   There is a number of managed objects defined in this MIB module that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write or read-create.  Most objects
   are writeable only when the link is Down.  Writing to these objects
   can have potentially disruptive effects on network operation, for
   example:

   o  Changing of efmCuPmeAdminSubType MAY lead to a potential locking
      of the link, as peer PMEs of the same sub-type cannot exchange
      handshake messages.

   o  Changing of efmCuPAFAdminState to enabled MAY lead to a potential
      locking of the link, if the peer Phy does not support PAF.

   o  Changing of efmCuPAFDiscoveryCode, before the discovery operation,
      MAY lead to a wrongful discovery, with possile multiple -O ports
      connecting to the same -R (both -O ports have the same Discovery
      register value) and similar cases.

   o  Changing PCS or PME configuration parameters (e.g.  profile of a
      PCS or PME via efmCuAdminProfile or efmCuPmeAdminProfile) MAY lead
      to anything from link quality and rate degradation to a complete
      link initialization failure, as ability of an EFMCu port to
      support a particular configuration depends on the copper
      environment.

   o  Activation of a PME can cause a severe degradation of service for
      another EFMCu Phy whose PME(s) MAY be affected by the cross-talk
      from the newly activated PME.

   o  Removal of a PME from the operationally 'up' EFMCu port,
      aggregating several PMEs, MAY lead a link rate degradation

   The user of this MIB module must therefore be aware that support for
   SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper protection
   can have a negative effect on network operations.

   The readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., those with MAX-ACCESS
   other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive in some
   environments since, collectively, they provide information about the
   performance of network interfaces and can reveal some aspects of
   their configuration.  In particular since EFMCu can be carried over
   Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) voice grade copper in a bundle with
   other pairs belonging to another operator/customer, it is
   theoretically possible to evasdrop to an EFMCu transmission simply by
   "listening" to a cross-talk from an EFMCu pair, especially if the
   parameters of the EFMCu link in question are known.  In such

   environments it is important to control even GET and NOTIFY access to
   these objects and possibly even to encrypt their values when sending
   them over the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
