Abstract

   This document is a revision of RFC 2806.

   This document specifies the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) schemes
   "tel" for specifying the address of a terminal in the phone network.
   This document covers voice calls (phone calls, answering machines and
   voice messaging systems), facsimile (telefax) calls and data calls,
   for landline, ISDN and mobile subscribers.


1 Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.

2 Introduction

   This document defines the URI scheme "tel" that contains telephone
   numbers. The telephone number can refer to terminals in the telephone
   network or the Internet, mobile and landline devices, voice, data and
   fax devices. The URI can refer to originators or targets of a
   telephone call.

   The telephone number is understood as the canonical address of
   record, as they are handled by the signaling network. Generally, this
   means E.164 numbers, or numbers that can be trivially converted into
   them.  This differs from "dial strings", the actual numbers, symbols
   and pauses entered by a user to place a phone call. Dial strings are
   beyond the scope of this document.

   A dial-string is consumed by one or more network entities, and
   understood in the context of the configuration of these entities. It
   is used to generate a telephone number so that a call can be routed.
   Dial-strings may require pre-pended DTMF tones to handle local PBXs,
   and they may include post-dial DTMF signaling that could control an
   IVR.

   Telephone numbers, however, are addresses-of-record. Subscribers
   publish a phone number as a universal means of being reached. To
   reach a telephone number from a particular terminal, the user of that
   terminal or terminal has to know how to convert my telephone number
   into a dial string appropriate for that terminal. The telephone
   number itself does not convey what needs to be done in a local
   network, such as dialing '9' before placing a call, in order to reach
   the number. Telephone numbers are also the normalized way that



Schulzrinne/Vaha-Sipila                                       [Page 2]

Internet Draft                 RFC2806bis              February 17, 2002


   addresses are signaled in the PSTN.

   The notation for phone numbers is the same as in RFC 2303 [4] and RFC
   2304 [5]. However, the syntax differs since this document describes
   URIs whereas RFC 2303 and RFC 2304 specify electronic mail addresses.
   RFC 2303 and RFC 2304 use "/" to indicate parameters (qualifiers).
   Since URI use the forward slash to describe path hierarchy, the URI
   schemes described here use the semicolon, in keeping with SIP URI
   conventions [6].

   There are at least two ways one can envision making a telephone
   connection. In the first approach, a URI contains the dial string,
   which is then passed to an entity that can reproduce the actions
   specified in the dial string, by sending DTMF digits, waiting for
   dial tone, pausing and generating post-dial DTMF digits after the
   callee picks up. Another approach has the URI specify the telephone
   number. A dialer application is aware of local context, knowing, for
   example, whether special digits need to be dialed to seize an outside
   line, whether network, pulse or tone dialing is needed and what tones
   indicate call progress. The dialer then converts the telephone number
   into a dial string and performs the necessary signaling actions. The
   document below assumes the second model. The dialer does not have to
   be a user application as found in traditional desktop operating
   systems, but could well be part of an IP-to-PSTN gateway.

   The approach pursued here has the disadvantage that certain services,
   such as extensions on a PBX or electronic banking, cannot be
   specified in a URI.

   The URI is used as a request URI in SIP [6] requests. The SIP
   specification also inherits the subscriber part of the syntax as part
   of the user element in the SIP URI. Other protocols may use this URI
   for both query-based and prefix-based applications.

   A "client" is defined as software that can parse one or more of the
   URIs defined in this document and possibly place a call to a remote
   entity.

3 URI Comparisons

   URI comparisons are case-sensitive except that the scheme and
   parameter names are case-insensitive.

4 URI Syntax

   The URI is defined using the ABNF (augmented Backus-Naur form)
   described in RFC 2234 [7] and uses elements from the core definitions
   (Appendix A of RFC 2234).



Schulzrinne/Vaha-Sipila                                       [Page 3]

Internet Draft                 RFC2806bis              February 17, 2002


   The syntax definition follows RFC 2396, indicating the actual
   characters contained in the URI. Note that the reserved characters
   "+", ";", "=", and "?" MUST NOT be escaped if shown in the grammar
   definitions below as they are delimiters for the tel URI schemes.
   These reserved characters MUST be escaped if they appear in parameter
   values.

   Characters other than those in the "reserved" and "unsafe" sets (see
   RFC 2396) are equivalent to their "% HEX HEX" encoding.

   The "tel" URI has the following syntax:



        telephone-uri      =  "tel:" subscriber
        subscriber         =  global-number / local-number
        global-number      =  "+" 1*phonedigit [isdn-subaddress]
        *other
        local-number       =  1*(phonedigit / HEXDIGIT )
        [isdn-subaddress]
        context *other
        isdn-subaddress    =  ";isub=" 1*phonedigit
        context            =  ";context-tag=" 1*uric
        other              =  ";" oname "=" ovalue
        oname              =  1*uric
        ovalue             =  *uric
        phonedigit         =  DIGIT / visual-separator
        visual-separator   =  "-" / "." / "(" / ")"


5 Phone Numbers and Their Scope

5.1 Phone Numbers

   The <subscriber> part of the URI indicates the number. The phone
   number can be written in either global (E.164) or local notation.
   All phone numbers SHOULD be written in the international form unless
   they cannot be written. Private dialing plans, emergency ("911",
   "112") and some directory assistance numbers (e.g., "411") and other
   "service codes" (numbers of the form N11 in the United States) cannot
   be written in international form.

   Implementations MUST NOT assume that telephone numbers have a
   maximum, minimum or fixed length, or that they always begin with a
   certain number.

5.1.1 Separators in Phone Numbers




Schulzrinne/Vaha-Sipila                                       [Page 4]

Internet Draft                 RFC2806bis              February 17, 2002


   Phone numbers MAY contain visual separators. Visual separators
   (<visual-separator>) merely aid readability and MUST be ignored by
   the client.

   Even though ITU-T E.123 [2] recommends the use of space characters as
   visual separators in printed telephone numbers, tel URIs MUST NOT use
   spaces.

5.1.2 Alphabetic Characters

   In some countries, it is popular to write phone numbers using
   alphabetic characters which correspond to certain numbers on the
   telephone keypad.  The URI format does not support this since the
   mapping from alphabetic characters to digit is not standardized.

   Since terminal numbers (TNs) are encoded in BCD in ISUP, the
   characters "A" through "F" ("F" is currently not used) are also
   allowed.  These do not designate the fourth column of the DTMF tone
   matrix.

5.1.3 Global and Local Numbers

   Global (international) numbers are identified by the "+" character
   prefix. International numbers MUST be written with the country (CC)
   and national (NSN) numbers as specified in E.123 and E.164 [2,9].
   International numbers have the property of being unambiguous
   everywhere in the world if the client is properly configured and are
   RECOMMENDED.

   Local numbers only work within a certain geographical area or a
   certain part of the telephone network, e.g., a private branch
   exchange (PBX).  Some numbers may work from several networks but not
   from the whole world; these SHOULD be written in international form.
   URIs with local phone numbers should only appear environments where
   all local entities can successfully set up the call by passing the
   number to the dialing software as written.

   The phone-context parameter can be used to label the dialing context.
   The parameter value is implementation-defined; care must be taken
   that the URL does not "escape" the administrative domain that
   administers the namespace. [TBD: This is hardly satisfying.]
   Alternatively, a domain-name identifier can be used, e.g.,
   "houston.example.com".

5.2 ISDN Subaddresses

   A phone number MAY also contain an <isdn-subaddress> parameter which
   indicates an ISDN subaddress. The client SHOULD support ISDN



Schulzrinne/Vaha-Sipila                                       [Page 5]

Internet Draft                 RFC2806bis              February 17, 2002


   subaddresses if it supports ISDN call setup. If ISDN subaddressing is
   not supported by the caller, <isdn-subaddress> MUST be ignored and
   the user SHOULD be notified. The user or the client MAY opt not to
   place a call if this feature is not supported.

5.3 Other Parameters

   Future extensions to these URI schemes may add other parameters
   (<other> in the BNF). Such parameters can be either mandatory or
   optional. Optional parameters start with "o-". An implementation MAY
   ignore such parameters. Other parameters are mandatory; an
   implementation MUST NOT use the URI if it contains unknown mandatory
   parameters.

   For example, <other> parameters can be used to store application-
   specific additional data about the phone number, its intended use, or
   any conversions that have been applied to the number.

   All new parameters MUST be registered with IANA.

6 Examples

        tel:+358-555-1234567

             This URI points to a phone number in Finland capable of
             receiving voice calls. The hyphens are included to make the
             number more human- readable; they separate country, area
             codes and subscriber number.

7 Rationale

7.1 Why Not Distinguish Between Call Types?

   TBD.

   Signaling protocols such as SIP allow to negotiate the call type and
   parameters, making the very basic indication within the URL scheme
   moot.

7.2 Why "tel"?

   "Tel" was chosen since it is widely recognized none of the other
   suggestions appeared appropriate. "Callto" was discarded since URI
   schemes locate a resource and do not specify an action to be taken.
   `Telephone" and "phone" were considered too long and not as
   internationally recognized.

7.3 Why Use E.164-style Numbering?



Schulzrinne/Vaha-Sipila                                       [Page 6]

Internet Draft                 RFC2806bis              February 17, 2002


   E.164 refers to international telephone numbers, and the string of
   digits after the country code is usually a national matter.  Phone
   numbers are usually written as a simple string of numbers everywhere.
   Because of this, the syntax in this specification is intuitively
   clear to most people. This is the usual way to write phone numbers in
   business cards, advertisements, telephone books and so on.

   Not all phone numbers can be expressed this way. Some numbers, such
   as emergency numbers, must always be dialled as written, without
   prepending area or country codes.

   Also, when writing the phone number in the form described in this
   specification, the writer does not need to know which part of the
   number is the country code and which part is the area code. If a
   hierarchical URI would be used (with a "/" character separating the
   parts of the phone numbers), the writer of the URI would have to know
   which parts are which.

   Finally, when phone numbers are written in the international form as
   specified here, they are unambiguous and can always be converted to
   the local dialing convention, given that the user agent has the
   knowledge of the local country and area codes.

7.4 Equipment Diversity

   There are several ways for the subscriber to dial a phone number:

        Pulse dialing: Usually pulse dialing method has only to be used
             to set up the call; after connecting to the remote entity,
             <post-dial> can be sent to the callee using DTMF, because
             it will typically be processed by the callee, not the
             telephone network.

        DTMF: Two-tone combinations are sent in-band to the telephone
             switching equipment.

        Direct network signalling: ISDN subscribers and mobile phones
             usually signal via a separate packet (signaling) channel.
             There is no dial tone (or if there is, it is generated
             locally by the equipment).

7.5 Do Not Confuse Numbers with How They Are Dialled

   As an example, +123456789 will be dialled in many countries as
   00123456789, where the leading "00" is a prefix for international
   calls. Tel URIs should, in general, not contain local phone numbers
   such as 00123456789, as the transformation back to an international
   number is not guaranteed to be correct or unique. If a client



Schulzrinne/Vaha-Sipila                                       [Page 7]

Internet Draft                 RFC2806bis              February 17, 2002


   receives a telephony URI with a local number in it, it MUST make sure
   that it knows the context in which the local phone number is to be
   processed, or else the number MUST NOT be used. Equally, the
   originator of a telephony URI must take into consideration that the
   recipient may have insufficient information about the phone number's
   context.

   When overlap signaling is used, devices which collect dial strings
   MUST construct a complete phone number before constructing the tel
   URI and including the URI in a network request. In other words, such
   devices must convert from overlap dialing to en bloc signaling.

8 Usage of Telephone URIs in HTML

   The number SHOULD be visible to the end user if it is conceivable
   that the user might not have a client which is able to use these
   URIs.


     Telephone: <a href="tel:+3585551234567">+358-555-1234567</a>



   On a public HTML page, the telephone number in the URI SHOULD always
   be in the international form, even if the text of the link uses some
   local format.


     Telephone: <a href="tel:+3585551234567">(0555) 1234567</a>



   or even

     OK</a>.



9 IANA Considerations

   <Other> parameters MUST be registered with IANA.

10 Security Considerations

   The security considerations parallel those for the mailto URL [11].

Internet Draft                 RFC2806bis              February 17, 2002


   A client SHOULD NOT place calls without the consent of its owner.
   Placing calls automatically without appropriate user confirmation may
   incur a number of risks, such as those described below.

        o Calls may incur costs.

        o The URI may be used to place malicious or annoying calls.

        o A call will take the user's phone line off-hook, thus
          preventing its use.

        o A call may reveal the user's, possibly unlisted, phone number
          to the remote host in the caller identification data, and may
          allow the attacker to correlate the client's phone number with
          other information such as the e-mail or IP address.

        o A call may use the same local number in different contexts, in
          which the number may have a different meaning.

   The client SHOULD NOT rapidly redial busy numbers to avoid the
   congestion of the (signaling) network. The client SHOULD detect if
   the number is unavailable or if the call is terminated before the
   dialing string has been completely processed (for example, the call
   is terminated while waiting for user input) and not try to call
   again, unless instructed by the user.

11 Changes Since RFC 2806

   The specification is backwards-compatible with RFC 2806.

        o Editorial changes and clarifications. The document has been
          shortened and reorganized. Most paragraphs have been rewritten
          to be more concise.

        o Syntax now conforms to RFC 2396, in particular related to
          escaping.

12 Changes Since -01

   The draft has been greatly simplified to reflect parts that have
   actually been implemented.

        o Removed references to carrier selection.

        o Removed dial context.

        o Removed fax and modem URIs.
