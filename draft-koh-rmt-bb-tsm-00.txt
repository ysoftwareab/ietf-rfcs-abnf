   include Session Join, Session Monitoring and Session Maintenance.  In
   Session Join, the sender informs authorized receivers about the
   target values of TSM parameters.  In Session Monitoring, each
   receiver continues to measure the parameter values that have been
   experienced and to report the status of each parameter value to the
   sender.  Based on the status information monitored and the target
   values of TSM parameters, the sender takes Session Maintenance
   actions necessary to maintain the session status desirable.  Those
   actions include adjustment of data transmission rate, troublemaker
   ejection, session pause/resume, and session termination.  TSM
   mechanisms can be implemented into an API and easily adopted by any
   RMT PIs that wish to tightly control multicast sessions.


1. Introduction

   A multicast transport protocol instantiation may include various
   protocol components such as error recovery, flow and congestion
   control, membership management, and session management [RMT-DS, RMT-
   BB].

   This document provides a framework of Transport Session Management
   (TSM) mechanisms, which has been designed to support desirable
   management of end-to-end multicast sessions, according to the
   application's requirements that are represented as a set of TSM
   parameters including throughput and packet loss rate.  TSM operations
   include Session Join, Session Monitoring and Session Maintenance.  In
   Session Join, the sender informs authorized receivers about the
   target values of TSM parameters.  In Session Monitoring, each
   receiver continues to measure the parameter values that have been
   experienced and to report the status of each parameter value to the
   sender.  Based on the status information monitored and the target
   values of TSM parameters, the sender takes Session Maintenance
   actions necessary to maintain the session status desirable.  Those
   actions include adjustment of data transmission rate, troublemaker
   ejection, session pause/resume, and session termination.

   The key feature of TSM is to provide the senders with information on
   membership tracking and current session status in terms of TSM
   parameters.  Membership information is crucial for design of
   billing/charging model.  Session status needs to be monitored to
   maintain the session desirable.

   TSM is a coarsely grained functionality for end-to-end multicast
   transport, and thus can be considered as a Building Block of RMT.
   TSM mechanisms can be implemented into an API and easily adopted by
   any RMT PIs that wish to tightly control multicast sessions.

1.1 Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Transport Session

   Transport Session refers to a session for multicast data delivery.
   In a one-to-many multicast session, there are a single sender and
   many receivers.

   Transport Session Management (TSM)

   TSM functionality is provided to maintain a multicast session
   desirable, according to application's requirements.  TSM mechanisms
   can be implemented into an API that a multicast transport protocol
   adopts easily.

   TSM Parameters

   A TSM parameter is a performance metric that represents session
   status and Quality of Services for the multicast data delivery.
   Typical examples of TSM parameters include throughput and packet loss
   rate.  According to application's requirements, the sender may
   configure a set of target values of each TSM parameter for desirable
   display of application data.  For Session Monitoring, each receiver
   reports the experienced status for each TSM parameter to the sender.

1.2 Motivations for TSM

   Some multicast applications have a crucial need to guarantee a
   desired Quality of Service (QoS) in the delivery of multicast data.
   In principal, the QoS for data delivery can be supported with help of
   network-layer resource reservation mechanisms such as RSVP or
   Diffserv.  However, in the end-to-end transport level, the sender
   needs to monitor and manage how much desirably the QoS for a
   multicast session is being supported [ECTS, ECTP].

   TSM functionality is designed to support a tight control of multicast
   sessions.  TSM mechanisms can be used to maintain the transport
   session desirable according to the application's requirements, and
   also to protect the session status from being degraded more severely.

1.3 Rationale of TSM BB

1.4 Applicability Statement

   Per the guidelines of RMT BB draft [RMT-Author], this section will be

   TBD

1.5 Relationship with the other BBs and PIs

   TSM BB does not impose any requirements and modifications on existing
   RMT BBs and PIs.  The TSM functionality and its mechanisms can be
   easily adopted by any RMT PIs that wish a tight control of multicast
   session.

   We note that TSM BB is a good-match with TRACK BB and PI, in the
   viewpoint of scalability enhancement of feedback messages from
   receivers to sender.  For the sessions concerned with the
   scalability, it is likely that TSM BB is employed along with TRACK BB
   or its underlying mechanisms.

   For the other PIs such as NORM and ALC, TSM can also be employed with
   provisioning of a suitable feedback mechanism.


2. TSM Overview

   Transport Session Management (TSM) is designed to support a tight
   control of multicast sessions.  TSM functionality is accomplished by
   interactions between the sender and receivers.  In TSM, the sender is
   responsible for overall TSM operations.

   Figure 1 illustrates an overall TSM functionality during a multicast
   session.

   TSM functionality is achieved by the following operations:
    (a) Session Join
    (b) Session Monitoring
    (c) Session Maintenance

   In Session Join, the following two events occur:
     - Join Request by a receiver
     - Join Confirm by the sender

   Each receiver who wants to participate in the session sends a Join
   Request message to the sender.  The sender may make a decision
   whether the join request should be accepted or not, possibly along

   with an authentication process.  When the join request is accepted,
   the sender will sends a Join Confirm message that contains
   information on the target values of TSM parameters such as throughput
   and packet loss rate.

                          Figure 1. TSM Overview


   Session Monitoring is used for sender to diagnose current session
   status for multicast data delivery.  Session Monitoring also performs
   'Membership Tracking', by which the sender keeps track of the list of
   active receivers.

   For Session Monitoring, each receiver is required to measure a status
   value for each TSM parameter that has been experienced for the
   received multicast data streams.  If a status value indicates an
   abnormal status, the receiver reports the status value to the sender
   via a TSM Response message.

   TSM Response messages are also generated in response to the periodic
   TSM Request messages of the sender.  Through these interactions with
   receivers, the sender can perform the membership tracking.

INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: August 2001           February 2001


   Session Maintenance is performed based on the reported status values
   and the target values for TSM parameters.  Sender continues to
   aggregate the status values that have been reported from the
   receivers.  Based on the aggregated information, the sender will take
   one or more of the following Session Maintenance actions:
    - Adjustment of data transmission rate
    - Troublemaker ejection
    - Session pause/resume
    - Session termination

   TSM Request messages are also used to indicate a current session
   status, which is classified into one of the following:
    - Session Creation
    - Data Transmission
    - Session Pause
    - Session Termination


3. TSM Components

3.1 Sender

   Sender transmits multicast data to the receivers in the session.  It
   is responsible for the overall TSM operations.

3.2 Receiver

   A receiver receives multicast data from the sender.  TSM is based on
   interaction between sender and receivers.

3.3 TSM Parameters

   TSM parameters are used to diagnose a current session status.  This
   document specifies two TSM parameters: throughput and packet loss
   rate.  In the future, more TSM parameters may be added, if necessary.

   Throughput (THRUPUT) can be represented in units of bytes per second.
   THRUPUT can be interpreted as data transmission rate at the sender
   side and also data reception rate at receiver side.  Packet loss rate
   (PLR) is defined as the ratio of lost packets over totally
   transmitted packets.  PLR may be represented as an integer number
   ranged from 0 to 100.  The sequence numbers of data packets can be
   used to measure the packet loss rate.

   In Session Join, the sender announces the authorized receiver about
   the pre-configured target values for each TSM parameter such as
    - MIN: a minimum value
    - ALLOWED_LOW: an allowed low value



Koh, et al.            draft-koh-rmt-bb-tsm-00.txt              [Page 6]






INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: August 2001           February 2001


    - ALLOWED_HIGH: an allowed high value
    - MAX: a maximum value

   These target values MAY be determined by considering application's
   requirements.  Among those values, the following inequalities are
   enforced:

                 MIN <= ALLOWED_LOW <= ALLOWED_HIGH <= MAX

   For THRUPUT parameter, the following variables can be defined:
    - MIN_THRUPUT
    - ALLOWED_LOW_THRUPUT
    - ALLOWED_HIGH_THRUPUT
    - MAX_THRUPUT

   For PLR parameter, the following variables can be defined:
    - MIN_PLR
    - ALLOWED_LOW_PLR
    - ALLOWED_HIGH_PLR
    - MAX_PLR

   In Session Monitoring, each receiver is required to measure the
   parameter values experienced for the received multicast data.  By
   comparing the measured values and the target values, the receiver
   sets each of THRUPUT_STATUS and PLR_STATUS to an integer of '0
   through 4' as follows:

    0, if ALLOWED_LOW <= measured value <= ALLOWED_HIGH
    1, if MIN <= measured value <= ALLOWED_LOW
    2, if ALLOWED_HIGH <= measured value <= MAX
    3, if measured value <= MIN
    4, if MAX <= measured value

   The STATUS value of '0' represents a normal status, while the non-
   zero values mean that the session possibly goes into abnormal status
   (1 or 2), or is currently being in an abnormal status (3 or 4).

   In Session Monitoring, receivers report those STATUS values to the
   sender via TSM Response messages.

3.4 TSM Messages

   The following control messages are used for TSM:
    - Join Request
    - Join Confirm
    - Ejection
    - TSM Request
    - TSM Response

   Table 1 summarizes the detailed use of those TSM messages.

                                             S: Sender, R : Receiver



3.4.1 Join Request

   A receiver that wishes to join the session sends a Join Request to
   the sender.

3.4.2 Join Confirm

   The sender responds with a Join Confirm message to the Join Request.
   The Join Confirm message contains the following information:
    - Whether a Join Request is accepted or not
    - Target values for TSM parameters: MIN, ALLOWED_LOW, ALLOWED_MAX,
      MAX
    - Receiver ID for the corresponding receiver

   The receiver ID can be used for membership tracking, and also used in
   generation of a TSM Response message (see Section 5).

3.4.3 Ejection

   In Session Maintenance, the sender MAY eject the trouble-making
   receiver by sending an Ejection message.

3.4.4 TSM Request

   The sender transmits periodic TSM Request messages to the receivers.



Koh, et al.            draft-koh-rmt-bb-tsm-00.txt              [Page 8]






INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: August 2001           February 2001


   The length of periodic time interval MAY vary depending on
   implementations.

   Each TSM Request message triggers the corresponding TSM Response
   messages from some or all of the receivers.  The TSM Request message
   contains an integer value to indicate the current session status.  To
   do this, the current session status is classified into one of the
   following phases, with an integer value:
    - Session Creation (0)
    - Data Transmission (1)
    - Session Pause (2)
    - Session Termination (3)

   When a session starts, the sender indicates 'Session Creation'.  If
   TSM BB is used in TRACK PI, 'Session Creation' state can be used as
   an indication signal for an initial tree configuration [TREE].  After
   a session is created, the TSM Request messages will indicate 'Data
   Transmission'.  'Session Pause' will be indicated if a sender
   realizes that the session potentially goes into an abnormal status.
   In Session Pause period, the sender is not allowed to send any new
   multicast data.  When the session status is perceived to go back to a
   normal status, the sender will again indicate 'Data Transmission',
   and then resumes the multicast data transmission.  'Session
   Termination' is indicated after the sender transmits all the
   multicast data, or if the session is detected to be in the severe
   abnormal status.


3.4.5 TSM Response

   A TSM Response messages contain the following information:
    - Receiver ID
    - THRUPUT_STATUS (ranged from 0 - 4)
    - PLR_STATUS (ranged from 0 - 4)

   Each receiver generates a TSM message if its measured THRUPUT_STATUS
   or PLR_STATUS is a non-zero value.  TSM messages can also be
   generated in response to a periodic TSM Request message.


4. TSM Procedures

4.1 Session Join

   A receiver who wants to join a session sends a Join Request message
   to the sender.  When the sender receives a Join Request message, it
   MAY check whether the receiver is an authorized user or not.




Koh, et al.            draft-koh-rmt-bb-tsm-00.txt              [Page 9]






INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: August 2001           February 2001


   In response to a Join Request, the sender transmits a Join Confirm
   message to the receiver.  The Join Confirm message contains
   information on Receiver ID and whether the Join Request is accepted
   or not.  The Join Confirm message also contains the pre-configured
   target values of TSM parameters: MIN, ALLOWED_LOW, ALLOWED_HIGH, and
   MAX (see 3.3).

   In the networks that support resource reservation mechanisms such as
   RSVP and Diffserv, the receiver SHALL initiate the reservation of the
   required network resources.  Then the target parameter values MAY be
   referred to in the reservation process.

4.2 Session Monitoring

   In Session Monitoring, the sender monitors how well the session
   operates and also which receivers are participating in the session.
   To do this, each receiver is required to measure the THRUPUT and PLR
   values experienced for the received multicast data.  Those measured
   THRUPUT and PLR values are compared with the target values for
   THRUPUT and PLR announced in Session Join, and then the receiver
   determines THRUPUT_STATUS and PLR_STATUS values as 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4
   (see 3.3).

   If the STATUS value is a non-zero value, the receiver generates a TSM
   Response message.  For the STATUS value of '0', the receiver does not
   need to generate a TSM Response message.  In other words, the sender
   will realize that a receiver is in the normal status, if it does not
   send any TSM Response messages indicating an abnormal status, where
   an abnormal status indicates that the STATUS value is non-zero.

   TSM Response message is also generated responsively to a periodic TSM
   Request message.  This feedback mechanism is designed to support
   Membership Tracking and an overall identification of the current
   session status.

   In response to the periodic TSM Request message, some or all of
   receivers send TSM Response messages to the sender.  To reduce the
   number of simultaneous TSM Response messages from the receivers, a
   specific rule MAY be employed.  An example is given in Section 5.

   During a session, the sender aggregates the reported THRUPUT_STATUS
   and PLR_STATUS values from the receivers.  In the aggregation, the
   following considerations will be taken:
    - Which receivers are in the abnormal status ?
    - How many receivers in a given session are in the abnormal status ?

   Based on this aggregated information, the sender takes one or more
   Session Maintenance actions.

4.3. Session Maintenance

   Session Maintenance is purposed to maintain the session status
   desirable, and to prevent the session status from being degraded more
   severely.

   Based on the THRUPUT_STATUS and PLR_STATUS values reported from the
   receivers, the sender takes one or more of the following Session
   Maintenance actions:
    - Adjustment of data transmission rate
    - Ejection of Troublemaker
    - Session Pause and Resume
    - Session Termination

   Depending on application services, some of the actions described
   above MAY NOT be enabled.  For example, for a certain multicast
   session, the sender MAY NOT perform Troublemaker Ejection.

4.3.1 Adjustment of data transmission rate

   If this option is enabled, the sender will adjust data transmission
   rate based on the monitored STATUS values of the TSM parameters.  The
   data transmission rate is bounded as follows:

           MIN_THRUPUT <= Data Transmission Rate <= MAX_THRUPUT

   Specific rules to increase or decrease the data transmission rate are
   for further study, which MAY depend on the Congestion Control
   algorithm that will be developed in the RMT WG.

4.3.2 Ejection of Troublemaker

   To determine whether a receiver is a troublemaker or not, the sender
   MUST configure a rule to trigger a Troublemaker Ejection.  The
   specific rule is an implementation issue.  For an example, a receiver
   can be regarded as a troublemaker if the STATUS values for TSM
   parameters have been consecutively in abnormal status more than the
   pre-configured threshold times.

   Once a troublemaker is detected, the sender sends an Ejection message
   to the concerned receiver.

4.3.3 Session Pause and Resume

   Session Pause is used to suspend the data transmission of the sender
   temporarily and thus to prevent the session from being more severely
   degraded.




Koh, et al.            draft-koh-rmt-bb-tsm-00.txt             [Page 11]






INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: August 2001           February 2001


   The sender announces 'Session Pause' to all the receivers via TSM
   Request message, which has the session status value of '2' (see
   3.4.4).  In the Session Pause period, the sender SHALL NOT send any
   new multicast data.

   The specific rule to trigger Session Pause can be configured based on
   the STATUS values reported from the receivers.  For an example, if
   the number of receivers reporting an abnormal status is greater than
   a pre-configured number, then the sender MAY trigger Session Pause.

   After Session Pause is indicated, Session Resume will be activated if
   the session status is perceived to come back into the normal state.
   The specific rule to trigger Session Resume is an implementation
   issue.  A simple rule to trigger the Session Resume is to use a
   timer.  In this case, if the timer expires after Session Pause is
   indicated, then the sender will automatically resume the session by
   sending a TSM Request message with an indication of 'Data
   Transmission' (see 3.4.4).

4.3.4 Session Termination

   The natural option for Session Termination is to terminate a session
   when all the multicast data have been transmitted.  Session
   Termination is also triggered if the session is detected to be in the
   severe abnormal state.  When Session Termination is indicated, the
   sender terminates the session and sends a TSM Request message with
   indication of Session Termination.

   The activation of Session Termination can be performed in various
   ways.  One simple way is to trigger Session Termination if the
   Session Pause/Resume operations have been consecutively repeated more
   than a pre-configured times.


5. Scalability Enhancement for Feedback Implosions of TSM Response
   Messages

   Session Monitoring is based on the 'TSM Response' feedback messages
   from the receivers.  For the session that consists of a large number
   of receivers, simultaneous responses of TSM Response messages may
   induce an implosion of feedback messages.  This is referred to as the
   scalability problem.

   If a hierarchical control tree [TREE] is employed along with TSM BB,
   it is clear that we reduce the number of simultaneously generated TSM
   Response messages.  We also propose an alternate scheme to improve
   the feedback implosion, which has benefited from TRACK BB [TRACK].

   For this purpose, we define the following two new variables:
    - TSM Sequence Number (TSN)
    - Response Generation Number (RGN)

   TSN is an integer number sequentially assigned to each periodic TSM
   Request massage.  RGN is a scaling factor used to limit the number of
   the simultaneously responding receivers.  These variables will be
   contained in the periodic TSM Request message, if they are enabled
   for scalability enhancement.

   For a TSM Request message, each receiver responds with a TSM Response
   message, if the following condition holds true:

                    (TSN % RGN) == (Receiver ID % RGN),

   where % represents "modulo" operator.

   For an example, suppose there are receivers with Receiver ID =
   1,..,20.  In response to a TSM Request message with TSN = 3 and RGN =
   5, the receivers with Receiver ID = 3, 8, 13, 18 will transmit the
   corresponding TSM Response message.


6. Security Considerations

   The Join Confirm messages MAY be used to deliver the group key
   information to the receivers for security purposes, if necessary.  In
   this case, an initial group key will be distributed via the Join
   Confirm message, and the changed group key information via the
   subsequent TSM Request messages.
