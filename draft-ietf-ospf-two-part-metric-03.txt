                 draft-ietf-ospf-two-part-metric-03.txt

Abstract

   This document specifies an optional extension to the OSPF protocol,
   to represent the metric on a multi-access network as two parts: the
   metric from a router to the network, and the metric from the network
   to the router.  The router to router metric would be the sum of the
   two.

1.  Introduction

   For a broadcast network, a Network-LSA is advertised to list all
   routers on the network, and each router on the network includes a
   link in its Router-LSA to describe its connection to the network.
   The link in the Router-LSA includes a metric but the listed routers
   in the Network LSA do not include a metric.  This is based on the
   assumption that from a particular router, all others on the same
   network can be reached with the same metric.

   With some broadcast networks, different routers can be reached with
   different metrics.  RFC 6845 extends the OSPF protocol with a hybrid
   interface type for that kind of broadcast network, where no Network



Zhang, et al.             Expires June 6, 2016                  [Page 2]

Internet-Draft            ospf-two-part-metric             December 2015


   LSA is advertised and Router-LSAs simply include p2p links to all
   routers on the same network with individual metrics.  Broadcast
   capability is still utilized to optimize database synchronization and
   adjacency maintenance.

   That works well for broadcast networks where the metric between
   different pair of routers are really independent.  For example, VPLS
   networks.

   With certain types of broadcast networks, further optimization can be
   made to reduce the size of the Router-LSAs and number of updates.

   Consider a satellite radio network with fixed and mobile ground
   terminals.  All communication goes through the satellite.  When the
   mobile terminals move about, their communication capability may
   change.  When OSPF runs over the radio network (routers being or in
   tandem with the terminals), RFC 6845 hybrid interface can be used,
   but with the following drawbacks.

   Consider that one terminal/router moves into an area where its
   communication capability degrades significantly.  Through the radio
   control protocol, all other routers determine that the metric to this
   particular router changed and they all need to update their Router-
   LSAs accordingly.  The router in question also determines that its
   metric to reach all others also changed and it also needs to update
   its Router-LSA.  Consider that there could be many terminals and many
   of them can be moving fast and frequently, the number/frequency of
   updates of those large Router-LSAs could inhibit network scaling.

2.  Proposed Enhancement

   Notice that in the above scenario, when one terminal's communication
   capability changes, its metric to all other terminals and the metric
   from all other terminals to it will all change in a similar fashion.
   Given this, the above problem can be easily addressed by breaking the
   metric into two parts: the metric to the satellite and the metric
   from the satellite.  The metric from terminal R1 to R2 would be the
   sum of the metric from R1 to the satellite and the metric from the
   satellite to R2.

   Now instead of using the RFC 6845 hybrid interface type, the network
   is just treated as a regular broadcast network.  A router on the
   network no longer lists individual metrics to each neighbor in its
   Router-LSA.  Instead, each router advertises the metric from the
   network to itself in addition to the normal metric for the network.
   With the normal Router-to-Network and additional Network-to-Router
   metrics advertised for each router, individual router-to-router
   metric can be calculated.

   With the proposed enhancement, the size of Router-LSA will be
   significantly reduced.  In addition, when a router's communication
   capability changes, only that router needs to update its Router-LSA.

   Note that while the example uses the satellite as the relay point at
   the radio level (layer-2), at layer-3, the satellite does not
   participate in packet forwarding.  In fact, the satellite does not
   need to be running any layer-3 protocol.  Therefore for generality,
   the metric is abstracted as to/from the "network" rather that
   specifically to/from the "satellite".

3.  Speficications

   The following protocol specifications are added to or modified from
   the base OSPF protocol.  If an area contains one or more two-part
   metric networks, then all routers in the area must support the
   extensions specified herein.  This is ensured by procedures described
   in Section 3.7.

3.1.  Router Interface Parameters

   The "Router interface parameters" have the following additions:

   o  Two-part metric: TRUE if the interface connects to a multi-access
      network that uses two-part metric.  All routers connected to the
      same network SHOULD have the same configuration for their
      corresponding interfaces.

   o  Interface input cost: Link state metric from the two-part-metric
      network to this router.  Defaulted to "Interface output cost" but
      not valid for normal networks using a single metric.  May be
      configured or dynamically adjusted to a value different from the
      "Interface output cost".

3.2.  Advertising Network-to-Router Metric in OSPFv2

   For OSPFv2, the Network-to-Router metric is encoded in an OSPF
   Extended Link TLV Sub-TLV [RFC7684], defined in this document as the
   Network-to-Router Metric Sub-TLV.  The type of the Sub-TLV is TBD.
   The length of the Sub-TLV is 4 (for the value part only).  The value
   part of the Sub-TLV is defined as follows:

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |      MT       |        0      |          MT   metric          |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Internet-Draft            ospf-two-part-metric             December 2015


   Multiple such Sub-TLVs can exist in a single OSPF Extended Link TLV,
   one for each topology.  The OSPF Extended Link TLV identifies the
   transit link to the network, and is part of an OSPFv2 Extended-Link
   Opaque LSA.  The Sub-TLV MUST ONLY appear in Extended-Link TLVs for
   Link Type 2 (link to transit network), and MUST be ignored if
   received for other link types.

3.3.  Advertising Network-to-Router Metric in OSPFv3

   For OSPFv3, the same Network-to-Router Metric Sub-TLV definition is
   used, though it is part of the Router-Link TLV of E-Router-LSA [ietf-
   ospf-ospfv3-lsa-extend].  Currently OSPFv3 Multi-Toplogy is not
   defined so the only valid value for the MT field is 0 and only one
   such Sub-TLV SHOULD be included in the Router-Link TLV.  Received
   Sub-TLVs with non-zero MT field MUST be ignored.

   Similarly, the Sub-TLV MUST ONLY appear in Router-Link TLVs for Link
   Type 2 (connection to a transit network) and MUST be ignored if
   received for other link types.

3.4.  Advertising Network-to-Router TE Metric

   A Traffic Engineering Network-to-Router Metric Sub-TLV is defined,
   similar to the Traffic Engineering Metric Sub-TLV defined in
   Section 2.5.5 of [RFC 3630].  The only difference is the TLV type,
   which is TBD.  The Sub-TLV MUST only appear in type 2 Link TLVs
   (Multi-access) of Traffic Engineer LSAs (OSPF2) or Intra-Area-TE-LSAs
   (OSPFv3) [RFC 5329], and MUST appear at most once in one such Link
   TLV.

3.5.  OSPF Stub Router Behavior

   When an OSPF router with interfaces including two-part metric is
   advertising itself as a stub router [RFC6987], only the Router-to-
   Network metric in the stub router's OSPF Router-LSA links is set to
   the MaxLinkMetric.  This is fully backward compatible and will result
   in the same behavior as [RFC6987].

3.6.  SPF Calculation

   During the first stage of shortest-path tree calculation for an area,
   when a vertex V corresponding to a Network-LSA is added to the
   shortest-path tree and its adjacent vertex W (joined by a link in V's
   corresponding Network LSA), the cost from V to W, which is W's
   network-to-router cost, is determined as follows:

   o  For OSPFv2, if vertex W has a corresponding Extended-Link Opaque
      LSA with an Extended Link TLV for the link from W to V, and the



Zhang, et al.             Expires June 6, 2016                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft            ospf-two-part-metric             December 2015


      Extended Link TLV has a Network-to-Router Metric Sub-TLV for the
      corresponding topology, then the cost from V to W is the metric in
      the Sub-TLV.  Otherwise, the cost is 0.

   o  For OSPFv3, if vertex W has a corresponding E-Router-LSA with a
      Router-Link TLV for the link from W to V, and the Router-Link TLV
      has a Network-to-Router Metric Sub-TLV, then the cost from V to W
      is the metric in the Sub-TLV.  If not, the cost is 0.

3.7.  Backward Compatibility

   Due to the change of procedures in the SPF calculation, all routers
   in an area that includes one or more two-part metric networks must
   support the changes specified in this document.  To ensure that, if
   an area is provisioned to support two-part metric networks, all
   routers supporting this capability must advertise a Router
   Information (RI) LSA with a Router Functional Capabilities TLV [acee-
   ospf-rfc4970bis] that includes the following Router Functional
   Capability Bit:

             Bit       Capabilities

             0         OSPF Two-part Metric [TPM]

   Upon detecting the presence of a reachable Router-LSA without a
   companion RI LSA that has the bit set, all routers MUST recalculate
   routes w/o considering any network-to-router costs.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the following IANA assignments:

   o  A new bit in Registry for OSPF Router Informational Capability
      Bits, to indicate the capability of supporting two-part metric.

   o  A new Sub-TLV type in OSPF Extended Link TLV Sub-TLV registry, for
      the Network-to-Router Metric Sub-TLV.

   o  A new Sub-TLV type in OSPFv3 Extended-LSA Sub-TLV registry, for
      the Network-to-Router Metric Sub-TLV.

   o  A new Sub-TLV type in Types for sub-TLVs of TE Link TLV (Value 2)
      registry, for the Network-to-Router TE Metric Sub-TLV.
