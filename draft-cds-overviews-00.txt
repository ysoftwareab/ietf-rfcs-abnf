Cloud-based data providing service definition, concept, and use-cases
                       draft-cds-overviews-00

Abstract

  The standard defines terminologies and describes ecosystem for cloud- 
  based data providing service. In order to build unified data
  environment from the dispersed data, data providing service is 
  necessary for big data service. Therefore, this standard contributes to
  form common data providing ecosystem.

1. Introduction

  This standard proposes concept, definition, and use-case of cloud-based
  data providing service for big data service. First, the scope and 
  definition of data providing service are described. Second, ecosystem
  model and role classification are illustrated. Finally, use-cases for
  explaining data providing service are proposed.


2. Terminologies
2.1  Data generator
  The data generator generates data, provides metadata to data broker, 
  and provides API to the data refiner to access data.

2.2  Data broker
  The data broker brokerages data between the data generator and the 
  data customer.

2.3  Data refiner
  The data refiner refines data, which is from the data generator, and
  delivers data to the data customer.

2.4  Data customer
  The data customer uses data, which is provided by the data providing
  service.

3. Abbreviation
To be defined

4. Overview of cloud-based data providing service 
4.1. Concept of cloud-based data providing service
  Data is dispersed in different administration domain. For this reason,
  it is hard to search data in big data area, which highly needs data.
  This situation decreases the data availability. In order to increase 
  the data availability, an interface is needed to brokerage data in
  different administartion domain and to search data in single access
  point. For example, a user finds data which is in different
  administration domain, while it is still hard to use the data. That is
  because data type and access methods are different. A data customer 
  uses different methods to access data, and also the data may have 
  different type, so that a data customer does extra works, such as 
  converting, filtering. Thus, an interface is required to refine data
  in various administration domain in order to provide the customized 
  data. Above all, this standard to build unified interface for 
  searching and requesting data is required.  

4.2. Definition of cloud-based data providing service
  The data providing service is a service to brokerage metadata in order
  to search data in a unified interface and to refine data in order to 
  provide user customized data as user's request. For this, the data 
  providing service brokerages metadata, which is provided by the data 
  generator. A data customer searches data by the data providing service
  easily. And also, as user's request, the data refiner refines and 
  provides data to data customer.

4.3. Model of cloud-based data providing service
  This is a concept model. The concept model is described by roles 
  related with the data providing service, such as data generator, data
  broker, data refiner, data customer.

4.4. Role classification of cloud-based data providing service
4.4.1 Data generator
  The data generator creates and supplies data. To supply data, the 
  data generator provides metadata for searching data to the data 
  broker and provides API for accessing data to the data refiner.

  Activities of the data generator are follows
    - Data management (Creation, store, deletion)
    - Metadata provisioning (Metadata creation, metadata publish, 
      access policy management)
      NOTE - Metadata: detailed information of data (e.g., origin, type,
      creation time, and etc.)

4.4.2 Data provision providing service
4.4.2.1 Data broker
  The data broker brokerages metadata between the data generators and
  the data customers to search data.

  Activities of the data broker are follows.
    - Metadata provisioning (Metadata collection, search, update)
    - Providing catalogue
    - Data brokering (the data generator - the data customer, the data
      generator - the data refiner, the data refiner - the data customer) 
    - User requirement management

4.4.2.2 Data refiner
  The data refiner refines data, which is ingested from the data 
  generater, and delivers the refined data to the data customer.

  Activities of the data refiner are follows.
    - Data processing  by the data customer's requirements (Transforming,
      filtering, and de-noising)
    - Data integration by the data customer's requirements (Combining,
      forming, coordinating, and blending)
    - Refined data management

4.4.3 Data customer
  The data customer requests and uses data through searching data by 
  data catalogue provided by the data broker.

  Activities of the data customer are follows.
    - Use data (Data request, use)
    - User's feedback (Question, grade, and etc.)

5. Use-cases of cloud-based data providing service
  - Data catalogue service
  - Public data provisioning service
  - Data generator policy management service
  - Data generator-user data delivery service
  - Data filtering service
  - User feedback
