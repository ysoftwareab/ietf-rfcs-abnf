1.  Introduction

   DOTS defines a method of coordinating defensive measures among
   willing peers to mitigate attacks quickly and efficiently, DOTS
   signaling enables hybrid attack coordination between DOTS client that
   talks with attack target and DOTS server that talks with Mitigators
   [draft-ietf-dots-architecture].  But in [draft-ietf-dots-signal-
   channel] the YANG module "ietf-dots-signal-channel" did not include
   the DoS-Type field, which is important for the DDoS mitigation as
   well as network operations.

   DoS attacks can be genrated using different mechanism, such as ICMP
   Flood, TCP Flag Misuse, DNS replay.  Here list some DoS that occurs
   in different layer:

   o  Network layer: ICMP

   o  Transport layer: TCP, UDP

   o  Application layer: HTTP, SIP, DNS, NTP, ...

   Different DDoS mechanism may requires different mitigation method.
   but currently, different vendors have different view point on
   classifying DoS, which leads to interoperating and interworking
   issues.

   This document is to analyze the usage of DoS type in DOTS signaling,
   provide a classification framework for DoS type, and give suggestions
   on introducing DoS-Type into DOTS signaling.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology and Abbreviations

   The terminology and abbreviations used in this document are defined
   in this section.

   o  DDoS: A distributed denial-of-service attack, in which traffic
      originating from multiple sources is directed at a target on a
      network.  DDoS attacks are intended to cause a negative impact on
      the availability and/or other functionality of an attack target.
      Denial-of-service considerations are discussed in detail in [RFC
      4732].

   o  DDoS attack target: A network connected entity with a finite set
      of resources, such as network bandwidth, memory or CPU, that is
      the target of a DDoS attack.  Potential targets include (but are
      not limited to) network elements, network links, servers, and
      services.

   o  Mitigator: An entity, typically a network element, capable of
      performing mitigation of a detected or reported DDoS attack.  The
      means by which this entity performs these mitigations and how they
      are requested of it are out of scope.  The mitigator and DOTS
      server receiving a mitigation request are assumed to belong to the
      same administrative entity.

4.  Usage of DoS-type in DOTS signaling

   Various DoS-type means different attack method, may need different
   mitiagtion method also.  If DoS-type is included in to the DOTS
   signalling message, it will helps:

   o  Message routing:

   o

      *  DOTS Client: shall be able to make decision on which server to
         send the DOTS mitigation requests, in the one-Client multiple
         Server connection topology, according to predefined server
         capability configurations.

      *  DOTS Server: considering there are different kind of
         mitigators, each kind provides some types of DoS mitigation
         service accrodingly, the DOTS server shall need to know which
         mitigator is suitable for ceritain DoS attack.  This is very
         common situation when the mitigator is deployed in a
         virtualized resource pool.

   Analysis and Statistics:

   Both the DOTS gateway and DOTS server shall need to analysis and/or
   statistic the amount DoS attack and mitigation informations for
   operational purpose.

5.  Defination of DoS-type

   As we metioned different vendors have different view point on
   classifying DoS, New DoS types are constantly emerging, we can not
   can't enumerat all the DOS types exhaustively.  But we can define an
   open framework, that includes all common DoS types, while allows easy
   extension.

   The DoS type framework is classfied into different layers, i.e.,
   Network Layer, Transport Layer, Application Layer.  Listed as
   follows:

   Accroding to Table 1:

   o  This framework shall allow service providers, vendors to define
      they extended DoS type.

   o  The representation of each DoS type shall use a string type, and
      take the form of "Attack-type.Attack-Subtype".

6.  Suggetion on adding DoS-type into DOTS signaling message

   Accroding to the [draft-ietf-dots-signal-channel] the YANG module
   "ietf-dots-signal-channel" a DoS-Type field shall be added as
   follows:

             +--rw (message-type)?
                +--:(mitigation-scope)
                |  +--rw scope* [cuid mid]
                |     +--rw cdid?                   string
                |     +--rw cuid                    string
                |     +--rw mid                     uint32
                |     +--rw target-prefix*          inet:ip-prefix
                |     +--rw target-port-range* [lower-port upper-port]
                |     |  +--rw lower-port    inet:port-number
                |     |  +--rw upper-port    inet:port-number
                |     +--rw target-protocol*        uint8
                |     +--rw target-fqdn*            inet:domain-name
