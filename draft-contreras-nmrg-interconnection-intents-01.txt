1.  Introduction

   The success of Internet-based services has been built on top of the
   global reachability of content accessed by the end-users, which is
   facilitated by the interconnection of individual networks owned by
   distinct service providers constituting independent administrative
   domains.

   Such interconnection services have been initially based simply on
   delivery of IP traffic between the interconnected parties leveraging
   on BGP.  This peer model enables full connectivity.  However, the
   traditional interconnection model shows some limitations.

   New capabilities based on network programmability and virtualization
   are producing service situations where a connectivity only approach
   is not sufficient.  The availability of computing capabilities
   internal to the networks, or attached to them, enable new scenarios
   where those capabilities can be consumed through the advertising or
   exposing of these execution environments from the perspective of the
   raw infrastructure (i.e., compute, storage and associated
   networking).  In addition or complementary to that, even services or
   network functions could be advertised in order to make them available
   for interconnection.

   For example, as service we could consider the advertisement of CDN
   capabilities as in CDNi approach [RFC7336], while as network function
   we could consider functions like firewall, CGNAT, etc, present in the
   network [I-D.ietf-teas-sf-aware-topo-model].

   All these scenarios present clear evolutions of the interconnection
   model which can not be simply expressed through existing mechanisms,
   or at least, cannot be expressed in a simple (and comprehensive) way
   with such existing mechanisms.  Here is where an advanced
   interconnection intent can assist on declaring the goal of the
   interconnection transcending pure IP traffic exchange and including
   more advance capabilities as the ones mentioned before.

2.  Evolution of Network interconnection

   It becomes clear the trend to increasingly rely on multi-domain
   scenarios for the provision of services.  For instance, the access
   today to an on-demand OTT video on Internet implies the interaction
   of more than one single administrative domain.  Thus, end-to-end
   service delivery over multi providers or domains will become the
   norm.

   Complex network services leveraging on virtualization solutions and
   leveraging on different infrastructure environments pertaining to
   distinct administrative domains, that is, operated and managed by
   distinct providers, can be easily foreseen.

   It is then necessary to explore mechanisms for interconnecting that
   multiple domain environments in a common, portable way independently
   of the owner of such infrastructure.

3.  Interconnection intents

   The interconnection intent should provide enough abstractions to
   express a variety of interconnection options.

   The purpose of the interconnection intent can be multiple:

   o  to enable multi-domain network service programming, by soliciting
      interconnection of service / network functions in different
      domains

   o  to enable multi-domain deployment of virtualized network
      functions, by advertising the availability of compute and storage
      resources in different domains

   o  to facilitate multi-domain network function or service charging,
      by advertising (cumulative) costs in the different domains

   o  to enable traffic interchange, ie.  IP as in traditional peering
      or optical

   o  to put in place the right collection of policies to implement and
      operate the interconnection

   o  to facilitate whatever combination of all of them
