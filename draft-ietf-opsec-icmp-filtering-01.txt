Internet-Draft               ICMP Filtering                 October 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document document provides advice on the filtering of ICMPv4 and
   ICMPv6 messages.  Additionaly, it discusses the operational and
   interoperability implications of such filtering.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Internet Control Message Protocol version 4 (ICMP)

2.1.  ICMPv4 error messages

   [RFC0792] is the base specification for the Internet Control Message
   Protocol (ICMP) to be used with the Internet Protocol version 4
   (IPv4).  It defines, among other things, a number of error messages
   that can be used by end-systems and intermediate systems to report
   errors to the sending system.  The Host Requirements RFC [RFC1122]
   classifies ICMP error messages into those that indicate "soft
   errors", and those that indicate "hard errors", thus roughly defining
   the semantics of them.

   Section 3.2.2.1 of [RFC1122] specifies the amount of information to
   be included in the payload of an ICMP error message, and how ICMP
   error messages should be demultiplexed to the corresponding transport
   protocol instance.  Additionally, it imposes details some scenarios
   in which ICMP errors should not be generated.

   Section 4.1.3.3 of [RFC1122] states that UDP MUST pass to the
   application layer all ICMP error messages that it receives from the
   IP layer.

   Section 4.2.3.9 of [RFC1122] states that TCP MUST act on an ICMP
   error message passed up from the IP layer, directing it to the
   connection that created the error.

   Section 4.3.2 of [RFC1812] contains a number of requirements for the
   generation and processing of ICMP error messages, including:
   initialization of the TTL of the error message, the amount of data
   from the offending packet to be included in the ICMP payload, setting
   the IP Source Address of ICMP error messages, setting of the TOS and
   Precedence, processing of IP Source Route option in offending
   packets, scenarios in which routers MUST NOT send ICMP error
   messages, and application of rate-limiting to ICMP error messages.

   The ICMP specification [RFC0792] also defines the ICMP Source Quench

   message (type 4, code 0), which is meant to provide a mechanism for
   flow control and congestion control.

   [RFC1191] defines a mechanism called "Path MTU Discovery" (PMTUD),
   which makes use of ICMP error messages of type 3 (Destination
   Unreachable), code 4 (fragmentation needed and DF bit set) to allow
   systems to determine the MTU of an arbitrary internet path.

   Appendix D of [RFC4301] provides information about which ICMP error
   messages are produced by hosts, intermediate routers, or both.

2.1.1.  Destination Unreachable (Type 3)

   The ICMP Destination Unreachable message is sent by a router in
   response to a packet which it cannot forward because the destination
   (or next hop) is unreachable or a service is unavailable.  Examples
   of such cases include a message addressed to a host which is not
   there and therefore does not respond to ARP requests, and messages
   addressed to network prefixes for which the router has no valid
   route.  [RFC1812] states that a router MUST be able to generate ICMP
   Destination Unreachable messages and SHOULD choose a response code
   that most closely matches the reason the message is being generated.
   Section 3.2.2.1 of [RFC1122] states that a Destination Unreachable
   message that is received MUST be reported to the transport layer, and
   that the transport layer SHOULD use the information appropriately.

2.1.1.1.  Net Unreachable (code 0)

2.1.1.1.1.  Uses

   Used to indicate that a router cannot forward a packet because it has
   no routes at all (including no default route) to the destination
   specified in the packet.  A number of systems abort connections in
   non-synchronized states in response to this message, to avoid long
   delays in connection establishment attempts [RFC5461].

2.1.1.1.2.  Message specification

   Defined in [RFC0792].  Section 4.3.3.1 of [RFC1812] states that if a
   router cannot forward a packet because it has no routes at all
   (including no default route) to the destination specified in the
   packet, then the router MUST generate a Destination Unreachable, Code
   0 (Network Unreachable) ICMP message.  Section 3.2.2.1 of [RFC1122]
   states that this message may result from a routing transient, and
   MUST therefore be interpreted as only a hint, not proof, that the
   specified destination is unreachable.  For example, it MUST NOT be
   used as proof of a dead gateway.  Section 4.2.3.9 of [RFC1122] states
   that this message indicates a soft error, and therefore TCP MUST NOT

   abort the connection, and SHOULD make the information available to
   the application.

2.1.1.1.3.  Threats

   An attacker can potentially perform a Denial of Service (DoS) attack
   against the router by forcing it to generate a high volume of ICMP
   Destination Unreachable messages.  This can be done by flooding the
   router with packets which the attacker knows will result in the
   router spending resources in generating a high volume of ICMP
   messages.

   This can be mitigated by rate limiting the rate of IMCP messages
   generated.  For rate limiting ICMPv6 messages see Section 2.4.f of
   [RFC4443].

2.1.1.1.4.  Operational/interoperability impact if blocked

   May lead to long delays between connection establishment attempts
   that could have been avoided by those systems aborting non-
   synchronized connections in response to ICMP soft errors [RFC5461].

2.1.1.2.  Host Unreachable (code 1)

2.1.1.2.1.  Uses

   Used to indicate that a router cannot forward a to the intended

   connections in non-synchronized states in response to this message,

2.1.1.3.  Protocol Unreachable (code 2)

2.1.1.3.1.  Uses

   Used by hosts to indicate that the designated transport protocol is
   not supported.

2.1.1.3.2.  Message specification

   Defined in [RFC0792].  [RFC1122] states that a host SHOULD send a
   protocol unreachable when the designated transport protocol is not
   supported.  Section 4.2.3.9 of [RFC1122] states that this message
   indicates a hard error condition, so TCP SHOULD abort the connection.

2.1.1.4.  Port Unreachable (code 3)

2.1.1.4.1.  Uses

   Used by end-systems to signal the source system that it could not
   demultiplex the received packet (i.e., there was no listening process
   on the destination port).  Used by UDP-based trace route to locate
   the final destination (UDP probes are sent to an UDP port that is
   believed to be unused).  Some firewalls respond with this error
   message when a received packet is discarded due to a violation of the
   firewall security policy.  A number of systems abort connections in
   non-synchronized states in response to this message, to avoid long
   delays in connection establishment attempts [RFC5461].

2.1.1.4.2.  Message specification

   Defined in [RFC0792].  Section 3.2.2.1 of [RFC1122] states that a
   host SHOULD send an ICMP port unreachable when the designated
   transport protocol (e.g., UDP) is unable to demultiplex the datagram
   but has no protocol mechanism to inform the sender.  Additionally, it
   states that a transport protocol that has its own mechanism for
   notifying the sender that a port is unreachable MUST nevertheless
   accept an ICMP Port Unreachable for the same purpose.

   Section 4.2.3.9 of [RFC1122] states that this message indicates a
   hard error condition, so TCP SHOULD abort the connection.

2.1.1.4.3.  Threats

   Can be abused to perform connection-reset attacks
   [I-D.ietf-tcpm-icmp-attacks].

   An attacker can potentially perform a Denial of Service (DoS) attack

   Signals errors araising from IPv4 source routes.

2.1.1.6.2.  Message specification

   Defined in [RFC0792].  Section 3.2.2.1 of [RFC1122] states that his
   message may result from a routing transient, and MUST therefore be
   interpreted as only a hint, not proof, that the specified destination
   is unreachable.  For example, it MUST NOT be used as proof of a dead

   Originally meant to aid in congestion-control and flow-control.
   Currently ignored by most end-system implementations, because of its
   security implications (see [I-D.ietf-tcpm-icmp-attacks].

2.1.2.2.  Message specification

   The Source Quench message is defined in [RFC0792].

   Section 3.2.2.3 of [RFC1122] states that host MAY send a Source
   Quench message if it is approaching, or has reached, the point at
   which it is forced to discard incoming datagrams due to a shortage of
   reassembly buffers or other resources.  It also states that if a
   Source Quench message is received, the IP layer MUST pass it to the
   tansport layer, which SHOULD implement a mechanism for responding to
   ICMP Source Quench messages.

   Section 4.2.3.9 of the Host Requirements RFC [RFC1122] states that
   TCP MUST react to ICMP Source Quench messages by slowing transmission
   on the connection, and further further adds that the RECOMMENDED
   procedure is to put the corresponding connection in the slow-start
   phase of TCP's congestion control algorithm [RFC2581].

   Section 4.3.3.3 of the Requirements for IP Version 4 Routers RFC
   [RFC1812] notes that research seems to suggest that ICMP Source
   Quench is an ineffective (and unfair) antidote for congestion, and
   states that routers SHOULD NOT send ICMP Source Quench messages in
   response to congestion.  A router that does originate Source Quench
   messages MUST be able to limit the rate at which they are generated.
   Finally, Section 4.3.3.3 of [RFC1812] states that a router MAY ignore
   any ICMP Source Quench messages it receives.

2.1.2.3.  Threats

2.1.3.  Redirect (Type 5)

   Section 3.2.2.2 of [RFC1122] states that SHOULD NOT send an ICMP
   Redirect message, and that a host receiving a Redirect message MUST
   update its routing information accordingly, and process the ICMP
   redirect according to the rules stated in Section 3.3.1.2 of
   [RFC1122].  ICMP redirects that specify a a gateway that is not on
   the same connected (sub-) net through which the Redirect arrived, or
   that are received from a source other than the first-hop gateway
   SHOULD be silently disacarded.

   Section 4.3.3.2 of [RFC1812] states that a router MAY ignore ICMP
   Redirects when choosing a path for a packet originated by the router
   if the router is running a routing protocol or if forwarding is
   enabled on the router and on the interface over which the packet is
   being sent.

2.1.3.1.  Redirect datagrams for the Network (code 0)

2.1.3.1.1.  Uses

   Used by routers to communicate end-systems a better first-hop router
   for a particular network.  Currently ignored by a large number of
   stacks.

2.1.3.1.2.  Message specification

   Defined in [RFC0792].

2.1.3.1.3.  Threats

   Can be abused by an attacker to redirect all or some traffic to
   himself and/or to perform a DoS attack.

2.1.3.1.4.  Operational/interoperability impact if blocked

   If the ICMP redirect was originated in some network segment other
   than the one it should be forwarded on, there is no operational
   impact, as the message is bogus or part of an attack.  If an ICMP
   Redirect that was locally generated is blocked, the end-system will
   not be informed of the better first-hop for reaching the target
   network, and thus this would result in less-optimum routes being used
   to get the target network.

2.1.4.2.  fragment reassembly time exceeded (code 1)

2.1.4.2.1.  Uses

   Signals fragment reassembly timeout.  A number of systems abort
   connections in non-synchronized states in response to this message,
   to avoid long delays in connection establishment attempts [RFC5461].

2.1.4.2.2.  Message specification

   Defined in [RFC0792].  [RFC0792] states this message may be sent by a
   host reassembling a fragmented datagram if it cannot complete the
   reassembly due to missing fragments within its time limit.  Section

2.1.5.  Parameter Problem (Type 12)

   Section 3.2.2.5 of [RFC1122] states that a host SHOULD generate
   Parameter Problem messages.  An incoming Parameter Problem message
   MUST be passed to the transport layer, and it MAY be reported to the
   user.  Section 4.2.3.9 of [RFC1122] states that this message should
   be handled by TCP in the same way as Destination Unreachable codes 0,
   1, 5.

   Section 4.3.3.5 of [RFC1812] states that a router MUST generate a
   Parameter Problem message for any error not specifically covered by
   another ICMP message.  The IP header field or IP option including the
   byte indicated by the pointer field MUST be included unchanged in the
   IP header returned with this ICMP message.  Section 4.3.2 of the same
   document defines an exception to this rule.

2.1.5.1.  Pointer indicates the error (code 0)

2.1.5.1.1.  Uses

3.1.1.1.3.  Threats

   An attacker can potentially perform a Denial of Service (DoS) attack
   against the router by forcing it to generate a high volume of ICMP
   Destination Unreachable messages.  This can be done by flooding the
   router with packets which the attacker knows will result in the
   router spending resources in generating a high volume of ICMPv6
   messages.  This can be mitigated by rate limiting the rate of ICMPv6
   messages generated.  For rate limiting ICMPv6 messages see Section
   2.4.f of [RFC4443].

3.1.1.1.4.  Operational/interoperability impact if blocked

3.1.1.2.3.  Threats

   May reveal filtering policies.

   An attacker can potentially perform a Denial of Service (DoS) attack
   against the router by forcing it to generate a high volume of ICMP
   Destination Unreachable messages.  This can be done by flooding the
   router with packets which the attacker knows will result in the
   router spending resources in generating a high volume of ICMPv6
   messages.  This can be mitigated by rate limiting the rate of ICMPv6
   messages generated.  For rate limiting ICMPv6 messages see Section
   2.4.f of [RFC4443].

3.1.1.2.4.  Operational/interoperability impact if blocked

   May lead to long delays between connection establishment attempts or
   long response times that could have been avoided by aborting non-
   synchronized connections in response to ICMP soft errors [RFC5461].
