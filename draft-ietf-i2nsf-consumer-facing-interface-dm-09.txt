            I2NSF Consumer-Facing Interface YANG Data Model
            draft-ietf-i2nsf-consumer-facing-interface-dm-09

Abstract

   This document describes an information model and a YANG data model
   for the Consumer-Facing Interface between an Interface to Network
   Security Functions (I2NSF) User and Security Controller in an I2NSF
   system in a Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) environment.  The
   information model defines various types of managed objects and the
   relationship among them needed to build the interface.  The
   information model is organized based on the "Event-Condition-Action"
   (ECA) policy model defined by a capability information model for
   I2NSF [i2nsf-capability-im], and the data model is defined for
   enabling different users of a given I2NSF system to define, manage,
   and monitor security policies for specific flows within an
   administrative domain.

1.  Introduction

   In a framework of Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF),
   each vendor can register their NSFs using a Developer's Management
   System (DMS).  Assuming that vendors also provide the front-end web
   applications registered with an I2NSF User, the Consumer-Facing
   Interface is required because the web applications developed by each
   vendor need to have a standard interface specifying the data types
   used when the I2NSF User and Security Controller communicate using
   this interface.  Therefore, this document specifies the required
   information, their data types, and encoding schemes so that high-
   level security policies (or configuration information for security
   policies) can be transferred to the Security Controller through the
   Consumer-Facing Interface.  These policies can easily be translated
   by the Security Controller into low-level security policies.  The
   Security Controller delivers the translated policies to Network
   Security Functions (NSFs) according to their respective security
   capabilities for the required securiy enforcement.

   The Consumer-Facing Interface would be built using a set of objects,
   with each object capturing a unique set of information from Security
   Administrator (i.e., I2NSF User [RFC8329]) needed to express a
   Security Policy.  An object may have relationship with various other
   objects to express a complete set of requirements.  An information
   model captures the managed objects and relationship among these
   objects.  The information model proposed in this document is
   structured in accordance with the "Event-Condition-Action" (ECA)
   policy model.

   An NSF Capability model is proposed in [i2nsf-capability-im] as the
   basic model for both the NSF-Facing interface and Consumer-Facing
   Interface security policy model of this document.

   [RFC3444] explains differences between an information and data model.
   This document uses the guidelines in [RFC3444] to define both the
   information and data model for Consumer-Facing Interface.  Figure 1
   shows a high-level abstraction of Consumer-Facing Interface.  A data
   model, which represents an implementation of the information model in
   a specific data representation language, is also defined in this
   document.

   Data models are defined at a lower level of abstraction and provide
   many details.  They provide details about the implementation of a
   protocol's specification, e.g., rules that explain how to map managed
   objects onto lower-level protocol constructs.  Since conceptual
   models can be implemented in different ways, multiple data models can
   be derived from a single information model.

   The efficient and flexible provisioning of network functions by a
   Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) system leads to a rapid
   advance in the network industry.  As practical applications, Network
   Security Functions (NSFs), such as firewall, Intrusion Detection
   System (IDS)/Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), and attack
   mitigation, can also be provided as Virtual Network Functions (VNF)
   in the NFV system.  By the efficient virtualization technology, these
   VNFs might be automatically provisioned and dynamically migrated
   based on real-time security requirements.  This document presents a
   YANG data model to implement security functions based on NFV.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC3444]
   RFC8174 [RFC8174].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology described in [i2nsf-terminology]
   [client-facing-inf-req].

   This document follows the guidelines of [RFC8407], uses the common
   YANG types defined in [RFC6991], and adopts the Network Management
   Datastore Architecture (NMDA).  The meaning of the symbols in tree
   diagrams is defined in [RFC8340].

4.  Information Model for Policy

   A Policy object represents a mechanism to express a Security Policy
   by Security Administrator (i.e., I2NSF User) using Consumer-Facing
   Interface toward Security Controller; the policy would be enforced on
   an NSF.  Figure 2 shows the YANG tree of the Policy object.  The
   Policy object SHALL have the following information:

      Name:  This field identifies the name of this object.

      Rule:  This field contains a list of rules.  These rules are
             defined for 1) communication between two Endpoint Groups,
             2) for preventing communication with externally or
             internally identified threats, and 3) for implementing
             business requirement such as controlling access to internal
             or external resources for meeting regulatory compliance or
             business objectives.  An organization may restrict certain
             communication between a set of user and applications for
             example.  The threats may be from threat feeds obtained
             from external sources or dynamically identified by using
             specialty devices in the network.  Rule conflict analysis
             should be triggered by the monitoring service to perform an
             exhaustive detection of anomalies among the configuration
             rules installed into the security functions.

                      Figure 2: Policy YANG Data Tree

   A policy is a container of Rule(s).  In order to express a Rule, a
   Rule must have complete information such as where and when a policy
   needs to be applied.  This is done by defining a set of managed
   objects and relationship among them.  A Policy Rule may be related
   segmentation, threat mitigation or telemetry data collection from an
   NSF in the network, which will be specified as the sub-model of the
   policy model in the subsequent sections.  Figure 3 shows the YANG
   data tree of the Rule object.  The rule object SHALL have the
   following information:

      Name:  This field identifies the name of this object.

      Event: This field includes the information to determine whether
             the Rule Condition can be evaluated or not.  See details in
             Section 4.1.

      Condition:  This field contains all the checking conditions to
             apply to the objective traffic.  See details in
             Section 4.2.

      Action:  This field identifies the action taken when a rule is
             matched.  There is always an implicit action to drop
             traffic if no rule is matched for a traffic type.  See
             details in Section 4.3.

      IPsec-Method:  This field contains the information about IPsec
             method type.  There are two types such as IPsec-IKE and
             IPsec-IKEless [i2nsf-ipsec].

   Note that in the case of policy conflicts, the resolution of the
   conflicted policies conforms to the guidelines of "Information Model
   of NSFs Capabilities" [i2nsf-capability-im].

4.1.  Event Sub-model

   The Event Object contains information related to scheduling a Rule.
   The Rule could be activated based on a set time or security event.
   Figure 4 shows the YANG tree of the Event object.  Event object SHALL
   have following information:

      Security-event:  This field identifies for which security event
             the policy is enforced.  The examples of security events
             are: "DDOS", "spyware", "trojan", and "ransomware".

      Time-information:  This represents the security rule is enforced
             based on the period information with the end time for the
             event.

     Period: This represents the period of time the rule event is
             active.

     End-time:  This represents the end time of the event.  If the rule
             time has pass the end-time, the rule will stop repeating"

      Frequency:  This represents how frequent the rule should be
             enforced.  There are four options: "only-once", "daily",
             "weekly" and "monthly".

4.2.  Condition Sub-model

   This object represents Conditions that Security Administrator wants
   to apply the checking on the traffic in order to determine whether
   the set of actions in the Rule can be executed or not.  The Condition
   Sub-model consists of three different types of containers each
   representing different cases, such as general firewall and DDoS-
   mitigation cases, and a case when the condition is based on the
   payload strings of packets.  Each containers have source and
   destination-target to represent the source and destination for each
   case.  Figure 5 shows the YANG tree of the Condition object.  The
   Condition Sub-model SHALL have following information:

      Case (Firewall-condition):  This field represents the general
             firewall case, where a security admin can set up firewall
             conditions using the information present in this field.
             The source and destination is represented as firewall-
             source and firewall-destination, each referring to the IP-
             address-based groups defined in the endpoint-groups.

      Case (DDoS-condition):  This field represents the condition for
             DDoS mitigation, where a security admin can set up DDoS
             mitigation conditions using the information present in this
             field.  The source and destination is represented as ddos-
             source and ddos-destination, each referring to the device-
             groups defined and registered in the endpoint-groups.

      Case (Custom-condition):  This field contains the payload string
             information.  This information is useful when security rule
             condition is based on the string contents of incoming or
             outgoing packets.  The source and destination is
             represented as custom-source and custom-destination, each
             referring to the payload-groups defined and registered in
             the endpoint-groups.

      Case (Threat-feed-condition):  This field contains the information
             obtained from threat-feeds (e.g., Palo-Alto, or RSA-
             netwitness).  This information is useful when security rule
             condition is based on the existing threat reports gathered
             by other sources.  The source and destination is
             represented as threat-feed-source and threat-feed-
             destination.  For clarity, threat-feed-source/destination
             represent the source/destination of a target security
             threat, not the information source/destination of a threat-
             feed.

6.  Information Model for Threat Prevention

   The threat prevention plays an important part in the overall security
   posture by reducing the attack surfaces.  This information could come
   from various threat feeds (i.e., sources for obtaining the threat
   information).  There are multiple managed objects that constitute
   this category.  This section lists these objects and relationship
   among them.  Figure 13 shows the YANG tree of a Threat-Prevention
   object.

7.  Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) for I2NSF
    Consumer-Facing Interface

   Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) provides a user
   group with an access control with the following features [RFC8341]:

   o  Independent control of action, data, and notification access is
      provided.

   o  A simple and familiar set of datastore permissions is used.

   o  Support for YANG security tagging allows default security modes to
      automatically exclude sensitive data.

   o  Separate default access modes for read, write, and execute
      permissions are provided.

   o  Access control rules are applied to configurable groups of users.

   The data model of the I2NSF Consumer-Facing Interface utilizes the
   NACM's mechanisms to manage the access control on the I2NSF Consumer-
   Facing Interface.  The NACM with the above features can be used to
   set up the access control rules of a user group in the I2NSF
   Consumer-Facing Interface.  Figure 16 shows part of the NACM module
   to enable the access control of a user group for the I2NSF Consumer-
   Facing Interface.  To use the NACM, a user needs to configure a
   NETCONF or RESTCONF server to enable the NACM module.  Then, the user
   can simply use an account of root or admin user for the access
   control for the module of the I2NSF Consumer-Facing Interface (i.e.,
   ietf-i2nsf-cfi-policy).  An XML example to configure the access
   control a user group for the I2NSF Consumer-Facing Interface can be
   seen in Section 10.

8.  YANG Data Model of Consumer-Facing Interface

   The main objective of this data model is to provide both an
   information model and the corresponding YANG data model of I2NSF
   Consumer-Facing Interface.  This interface can be used to deliver
   control and management messages between an I2NSF User and Security
   Controller for the I2NSF User's high-level security policies.

   The semantics of the data model must be aligned with the information
   model of the Consumer-Facing Interface.  The transformation of the
   information model was performed so that this YANG data model can
   facilitate the efficient delivery of the control or management
   messages.

   This data model is designed to support the I2NSF framework that can
   be extended according to the security needs.  In other words, the
   model design is independent of the content and meaning of specific
   policies as well as the implementation approach.  This document
   suggests a VoIP/VoLTE security service as a use case for policy rule
   generation.

   This section describes a YANG data model for Consumer-Facing
   Interface, based on the information model of Consumer-Facing
   Interface to Security Controller.

9.  XML Configuration Examples of High-Level Security Policy Rules

   Note:  This section is informative with XML configuration examples.

   This section is informative with XML configuration examples.  This
   section shows XML configuration examples of high-level security
   policy rules that are delivered from the I2NSF User to the Security
   Controller over the Consumer-Facing Interface.  The considered use
   cases are: Database registration, time-based firewall for web
   filtering, VoIP/VoLTE security service, and DDoS-attack mitigation.

9.1.  Database Registration: Information of Positions and Devices
      (Endpoint Group)

   If new endpoints are introduced to the network, it is necessary to
   first register their data to the database.  For example, if new
   members are newly introduced in either of three different groups
   (i.e., user-group, device-group, and payload-group), each of them
   should be registered with information such as ip-addresses or
   protocols used by devices.  Figure 18 shows an example XML

9.2.  Scenario 1: Block SNS Access during Business Hours

   The first example scenario is to "block SNS access during office
   hours" using a time-based firewall policy.  In this scenario, all
   users registered as "employees" in the user-group list are unable to
   access Social Networking Services (SNS) during the office hours
   (weekdays).  The XML instance is described below:

   5.  The action required is to "drop" any attempt to connect to
       websites related to Social networking.

   6.  The IPsec method type used for nsf traffic steering is set to
       "ipsec-ike".

9.3.  Scenario 2: Block Malicious VoIP/VoLTE Packets Coming to a Company

   The second example scenario is to "block malicious VoIP/VoLTE packets
   coming to a company" using a VoIP policy.  In this scenario, the
   calls comming from from VOIP and/or VOLTE sources with VOLTE IDs that
   are classified as malicious are dropped.  The IP addresses of the
   employees and malicious VOIP IDs should be blocked are stored in the
   database or datastore of the enterprise.  Here and the rest of the
   cases assume that the security administrators or someone responsible
   for the existing and newly generated policies, are not aware of which
   and/or how many NSFs are needed to meet the security requirements.
   Figure 20 represents the XML document generated from YANG discussed
   in previous sections.  Once a high-level seucurity policy is created
   by a security admin, it is delivered by the Consumer-Facing
   Interface, through RESTCONF server, to the security controller.  The
   XML instance is described below:

   1.  The policy name is
       "security_policy_for_blocking_malicious_voip_packets".

   2.  The rule name is "Block_malicious_voip_and_volte_packets".

   3.  The Source is "malicious-id".  This can be a single ID or a list
       of IDs, depending on how the ID are stored in the database.  The
       "malicious-id" is the key so that the security admin can read
       every stored malicious VOIP IDs that are named as "malicious-id".

   4.  The destination target is "employees". "employees" is the key
       which represents the list containing information about employees,
       such as IP addresses.

   5.  The action required is "drop" when any incoming packets are from
       "malicious-id".

   6.  The IPsec method used for nsf traffic steering is set to "ipsec-
       ikeless".

9.4.  Scenario 3: Mitigate HTTP and HTTPS Flood Attacks on a Company Web
      Server

   The third example scenario is to "Mitigate HTTP and HTTPS flood
   attacks on a company web server" using a DDoS-attack mitigation
   policy.  Here, the time information is not set because the service
   provided by the network should be maintained at all times.  If the
   packets sent by any sources are more than the set threshold, then the
   admin can set the percentage of the packets to be dropped to safely
   maintain the service.  In this scenario, the source is set as "any"
   to block any sources which send abnormal amount of packets.  The
   destination is set as "web_server01".  Once the rule is set and
   delivered and enforced to the nsfs by the securiy controller, the
   NSFs will monitor the incoming packet amounts and the destination to
   act according to the rule set.  The XML instance is described below:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<i2nsf-cfi-policy xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-i2nsf-cfi-policy">
  <policy-name>security_policy_for_ddos_attacks</policy-name>

   1.  The policy name is "security_policy_for_ddos_attacks".

   2.  The rule name is "100_packets_per_second".

   3.  The destination target is "webservers". "webservers" is the key
       which represents the list containing information, such as IP
       addresses and ports, about web-servers.

   4.  The rate limit exists to limit the incoming amount of packets per
       second.  In this case the rate limit is "100" packets per second.
       This amount depends on the packet receiving capacity of the
       server devices.

   5.  The Source is all sources which send abnormal amount of packets.

   6.  The action required is to "drop" packet reception is more than
       100 packets per second.

   7.  The IPsec method used for nsf traffic steering is set to "ipsec-
       ike".

10.  XML Configuration Example of a User Group's Access Control for
     I2NSF Consumer-Facing Interface

   Note:  This section is informative with an XML configuration example.

   This is an example for creating privileges for a group of users
   (i.e., a user group) to access and use the I2NSF Consumer-Facing
   Interface to create security policies via the interface.  For the
   access control of the Consumer-Facing Interface, the NACM module can
   be used.  Figure 22 shows an XML example the access control of a user
   group (named Example-Group) for I2NSF Consumer-Facing Interface A
   group called Example-Group can be created and configured with NACM
   for the Consumer-Facing Interface.  For Example-Group, a rule list
   can created with the name of Example-Group-Rules.  Example-Group-
   Rules has two rules of Example-Group-Rule1 and Example-Group-Rule2 as
   follows.  For Example-Group-Rule1, the privilege of "Read" is allowed
   to Example-Group for the Consumer-Facing Interface.  On the other
   hand, for Example-Group-Rule2, the privileges of "Create", "Update",
   and "Delete" are denied against Example-Group for the Consumer-Facing
   Interface.

   The access control for the I2NSF Consumer-Facing Interface is as
   follows.

   1.  The NACM is enabled.

   2.  As a group name, Example-Group is specified.

   3.  As members of the group, Alice, Bob, and Eve are specified.

   4.  As a rule list name, Example-Group-Rules is specified for
       managing privileges of Example-Group's members.

   5.  As the first rule name, Example-Group-Rule1 is specified.  This
       rule is used to give read privilege to Example-Group's members
       for the module of the I2NSF Consumer-Facing Interface.

Internet-Draft  Consumer-Facing Interface YANG Data Model      July 2020


   6.  As the second rule name, Example-Group-Rule2 is specified.  This
       rule is used to deny create, update, and delete privileges
       against Example-Group's members for the module of the I2NSF
       Consumer-Facing Interface.

11.  Security Considerations

   The data model for the I2NSF Consumer-Facing Interface is based on
   the I2NSF framework [RFC8329], so the same security considerations
   with the I2NSF framework should be included in this document.  The
   data model needs a secure communication channel to protect the
   Consumer-Facing Interface between the I2NSF User and Security
   Controller.  Also, the data model's management access control is
   based on Network Configuration Access Control Model(NACM) mechanisms
   [RFC8341].

12.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to register the following URI in the
   "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688]:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-i2nsf-cfi-policy
   Registrant Contact: The I2NSF.
   XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.


   This document requests IANA to register the following YANG module in
   the "YANG Module Names" registry [RFC7950].

   name: ietf-i2nsf-cfi-policy
   namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-i2nsf-cfi-policy
   prefix: cfi-policy
