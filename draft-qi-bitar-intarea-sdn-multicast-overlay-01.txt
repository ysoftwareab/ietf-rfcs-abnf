    Abstract 
      This document describes a framework for IP multicast based on 
      the software defined networking paradigm.  The framework enables 
      flexible allocation of multicast responsibilities to designated 
      control and forwarding elements, and provides for multicast 
      path computation and programming of the forwarding plane. The 
      objective of this framework is to enable network operators to 
      support IP multicast in an IP/MPLS core free of Protocol-
      Independent-Multicast (PIM) and MPLS multicast control. The 
      forwarding paradigm provides for multicast replication over 
      unicast and multicast overlays at designated edges, and for 
      native IP and MPLS multicast replication and forwarding in the 
      core.

    Internet-Draft         SDN Multicast Overlay            July 2017 
     
       
    1. Introduction 
      Operators that enable multicast services in their network have 
      traditionally relied on host-based multicast protocols such as 
      Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP), and core-based 
      multicast protocols such as Protocol Independent Multicast 
      (PIM) with its variants, and more recently MPLS multicast 
      protocols. Some operators have encountered issues with these 
      protocols that have ensued from protocol activities, and perhaps 
      implementation behavior under some scale, that overloaded the 
      control plane of the routing nodes, sometimes effecting 
      scalability, and often leading to network instability. There 
      are four sources for this activity: (1) high dynamicity of 
      group membership, resulting in a high rate of join/leave, (2) 
      refresh of multicast soft state, (3) faulty implementation, and 
      (4) malicious attacks. 

      This document describes a framework for IP multicast based on 
      the software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm. The objective 
      of this framework is to allow an operator to flexibly design IP 
      multicast networks to fit its needs, and minimize network risks. 
      Specifically, it enables an operator to provide for multicast 
      services in its network without PIM or MPLS multicast signaling 
      protocols (i.e., point to multipoint Resource Reservation 
      protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE), or Multicast Label 
      Distribution Protocol (MLDP)). The elimination of these 
      protocols from network elements alleviates a good amount of 
      control plane activity often consumed by these protocols to 
      establish and maintain multicast soft sate, minimizing network 
      stability risks and providing for better scale.
 
      The SDN control plane described in this framework, provides for 
      (1) processing join and leave requests from receivers (e.g., 
      IGMP, PIM) or applications that request the addition or pruning 
      of receivers, (2) multicast entitlement and bandwidth admission 
      control, (3) the computation of a multicast path if necessary, 
      and (4) the establishment of the necessary forwarding states in 
      the nodes on the computed forwarding path.     
       
    2. Terminology 
    This document adopts the following SDN terminology from RFC7426 
    (SDN: Layers and Architecture Terminology):

      - Software-Defined Networking (SDN): A programmable 
      network approach that supports the separation of control and 
      forwarding planes via standardized interfaces. 

      - Forwarding Plane (FP): The collection of resources across 
      all network devices responsible for forwarding traffic.
 
      - Control Plane (CP): The collection of functions responsible 
      for controlling one or more network devices.  CP instructs 
      network devices with respect to how to process and forward 
      packets. The control plane interacts primarily with the 
      forwarding plane and, to a lesser extent, with the operational 
      plane. 
     
      Furthermore, this document adopts the following terminology   
      from RFC 7365, Framework for Data Center (DC) Network 
      Virtualization: 
     
      Tenant: The customer using a virtual network and any associated 
      resources (e.g., compute, storage, and network).  A tenant 
      could be an enterprise or a department/organization within an 
      enterprise. 
     
      Tenant System: A physical or virtual system that can play the 
      role of a host or a forwarding element such as a router, 
      switch, firewall, etc.  It belongs to a single tenant and 
      connects to one or more virtual networks (VNs) of that tenant.

    4. Problem Statement 
        IP multicast in core IP networks has prevailingly relied on 
        PIM-ASM to establish a multicast tree between the first hop
        router connected to a sender and the edge routers connected 
        to receivers, and relied on multicast source discovery protocols 
        to discover multicast sources. PIM is a soft state protocol 
        that relies on periodic join refreshes to keep the multicast 
        states alive and its mode of forwarding requires data-driven
        events. While PIM-SSM removed some of the above issues for 
        PIM-ASM, it is IGMPv3 dependent and requires out-of-band 
        source discovery mechanism. MPLS multicast signaling protocols, 
        namely point to multipoint RSVP-TE, imposes similar control 
        load on MPLS routers.  On access links, edge routers process 
        IGMP messages from attached receivers or CPEs, or PIM messages
        from attached CPEs. These messages signal to edge routers the 
        multicast membership state of the attached devices. IGMP is 
        also soft state, requiring periodic refreshes of join/prune 
        messages to refresh multicast membership state, or queries to 
        clean up stale state.  
         
        Multicast group activity (joining/leaving a multicast group) 
        could be very dynamic, resulting in a high control message 
        rate that increases with the number of multicast receivers, 
        and is highly dependent on the behavior of these receivers in 
        leaving/joining multicast groups.  
         
        All this control plane activity is performed on (all) nodes 
        in the network to support multicast, risking network control 
        plane scale and stability.  
         
        Routers not only run multicast control protocols, but also 
        perform data plane multicast, holding multicast forwarding 
        state and performing packet replication and forwarding. 
        Multicast forwarding state is dependent on the number of 
        multicast groups ((*,G) or (S,G)) and number of outgoing 
        interfaces per multicast group. As receivers join or leave 
        multicast groups, these multicast forwarding entries need to 
        be updated, further adding to a router control plane load. A

    Internet-Draft         SDN Multicast Overlay            July 2017 
        large number of (*,G)/(S, G) multicast states and control 
        information push against the resource limit of network 
        routing hardware (e.g., TCAM, CPU). On an edge node where the 
        number of outgoing interfaces could be very large, this 
        activity is further exacerbated. In addition, data 
        replication shares forwarding capacity (processing cycles and 
        bandwidth) with unicast, often mandating the need to control 
        the capacity allocated for multicast and enforcing it. 
         
        Native multicast protocol procedures do not address the 
        protection of a router control plane and data plane resources 
        from the negative impacts that multicast enablement may have 
        on these resources. Such negative impacts could be the result 
        of malicious activities, misconfigurations, or simply lack of 
        control on legitimate activities. For instance, a receiver 
        may maliciously join a large number of multicast groups and 
        create shared bandwidth bottlenecks if allowed to 
        successfully join these groups. Such a receiver may also 
        generate IGMP reports at a very high frequency, creating an 
        attack on the access router control plane if not properly 
        controlled. A host may also masquerade itself as a source for 
        many multicast groups, resulting in the creation of a large 
        number of forwarding state on the access router and other 
        core nodes. Some router vendors have implemented mechanisms 
        to protect against such attacks (malicious or not) on the 
        router control and data plane, but often these mechanisms are 
        not implemented, partially implemented or not implemented 
        with a consistent behavior let alone configuration as they 
        are vendor proprietary. Lack of consistency poses challenges 
        to network operators when multicast is to be enabled in a 
        multi-vendor environment. 
         
        Without some type of entitlement that could be defined and 
        uniformly enforced across all edge routers, a rogue multicast 
        sender that knows active multicast groups can send traffic to 
        these groups. The same goes for multicast receivers who may 
        snoop on multicast traffic that they are not entitled to by 
        simply joining the corresponding multicast group(s). Thus, 
        there is a need to define and enforce entitlement for 
        receivers to join multicast groups and for senders to be able 
        to send traffic to multicast groups to protect against the 
        negative impacts that sender and receiver misconfigurations 
        or malicious activities could inflict.

        There is need to (1) protect against multicast control 
        plane message attacks that may or may not result in a 
        receiver successfully joining a multicast group, (2) be able 
        to define and enforce entitlement for both receivers of and 
        senders to multicast groups, and (3) to protect against the 
        oversubscription of resources beyond set engineering targets 
        by performing resource (bandwidth and other resources) 
        admission control. 
         
        Multicast entitlement, admission control and control DDoS 
        protection are hard to implement in existing networks when 
        relying on router vendor implementations as they do not 
        holistically or uniformly address all needs, if any.  
         
        Finally, there is no multicast management plane or north-
        bound interface to harness multicast control state and 
        telemetry information that enable monitoring the state of the 
        network and enable controlling the usage of network resources. 
       
    5. Multicast SDN Framework Benefits 
        The multicast SDN framework is composed of an overlay control 
        plane that computes multicast distribution paths between 
        senders and receivers per multicast group/channel, and 
        establishes the forwarding path on forwarding elements, 
        enabling the distribution of multicast traffic between these 
        senders and receivers, and provides for increased 
        functionality and flexibility. The multicast overlay control 
        plane on centralized multicast SDN controller(s) alleviates 
        the multicast control plane activities performed by routing 
        nodes in traditional networks. The controller could be an 
        existing controller with multicast capability or a separate 
        multicast controller. 
         
        The multicast SDN framework provides the following benefits: 
         
         
        - By alleviating multicast control protocols and associated 
          processing and states off the distributed traditional 
          routing nodes in a network, the routing control plane of 
          these nodes will have an order of magnitude reduction in 
          complexity and a significant reduction in processing load,

          improving network stability and scalability and faster time 
          to recovery from failures. 
           
        - Much fine grained policy and advanced service enhancements 
          such as multicast control policy (access control, admission 
          control, entitlements and bandwidth), can be implemented 
          directly and consistently in the SDN multicast control 
          plane. This functionality can be and has been implemented 
          in traditional routers but at the expense of additional 
          processing requirements on the control plane and the burden 
          of ensuring consistent implementation across various 
          vendors. 
         
        - Much fine grained multicast path selection based on various 
          attributes (e.g., bandwidth, diversity, latency) and 
          programming, and various degree of replication, alleviating 
          the current congruency between multicast and unicast 
          topologies and providing flexibility in carving multicast

          and multiple administrative boundaries under the same 
          enterprise control can be implemented with a unified and 
          integrated Management Plane and Control Plane.  
         
        - Multicasting across administrative boundaries under the 
          control of different enterprises/operators, 
          can be implemented leveraging SDN mechanisms and/or 
          traditional distributed control mechanisms, depending on 
          the capabilities of the neighboring enterprise/operator
          domains.  
         
        - Control and/or management plane applications can 
          compute, modify, steer, and program forwarding plane 
          multicast paths, and query and harness state information 
          from the routing nodes performing multicast forwarding 
          using north bound interfaces from these nodes. 
       
        - Flexible design of the multicast services in the operator 
          network to address operator design principles and 
          the capabilities of the forwarding elements.

        - Agnosticism to whether an endpoint, multicast receiver or 
          sender, is a VM, container, or a physical host as they 
          all use the same overlay multicast service mechanisms. 
         
        - Applications can steer multicast path, query and harness 
          state information from SDN multicast overlays using 
          northbound interfaces. 
       
    6. Multicast SDN Framework Guiding Principles and Requirements 
      
      Following are the requirements that MUST be satisfied by the 
      Multicast SDN framework: 
       
      - No constraint on the network topology. The SDN framework will 
        need to be aware of the unicast and multicast network 
        topology when it needs to compute unicast and multicast paths 
        that satisfy certain constrains and/or to optimize for 
        network usage resources on these paths. 
          
      - No constraint on the unicast routing protocol selection in the 
        underlay network. The network may consist of multiple domains 
        with different unicast routing protocols. 
       
      - Be agnostic to other services in the network (e.g., 
        BGMP/MPLS unicast and multicast Layer2 and Layer3 services, 
        other types of VPN services). That is, it MUST allow new 
        multicast services to be enabled based on this framework in 
        the presence of other services. 
       
      - Support IPv4, IPv6, and MPLS unicast underlay data plane, 
        providing for edge replication over IPv4, IPv6,or MPLS 
        unicast overlays. 
       
      - Support IPv4, IPv6, and MPLS multicast data planes, providing 
        for replication over IPv4, IPv6, and MPLS 
        multicast overlays, and for the computation and programmability 
        of the overlay data paths on the underlay as needed.

      - Support a BIER [BIER-ARCH] underlay data plane to support 
        multicast replication of multicast packets over BIER type of 
        multicast overlays.  
       
      - Support a segment-routing (SR) [SR-ARCH] underlay data plane to 
        support edge replication of multicast packets over unicast SR 
        overlays with both IP and MPLS data planes. 
       
      - Support stitching of multicast packets across domains with 
        the different control and data planes stated in the earlier 
        requirements. 
       
      - Integrate with network multicast (control and data plane) 
        where operationally feasible resulting in optimum bandwidth 
        utilization in data plane. 
       
      - Enable decoupling of multicast topology from unicast 
        topology, providing the ability to enable multicast 
        selectively on nodes, and/or carving multicast paths. 
       
      - Enable select edge data replication nodes, specifically when 
        the first hop router connected to the Multicast sender is not 
        best suited for data replication. 
       
      - Support existing multicast applications without requiring any 
        modification to these applications, e.g., applications that 
        use IGMP for multicast membership 
       
      - Support the tunable aggregation of multicast groups on 
        multicast tunnels (where tunnels may be stateful tunnels, 
        or simply encapsulation headers)

        bandwidth efficiency with multicast data plane and control 
        plane state

        the receiver to a multicast group or channel 
       
      - Support programmability of multicast traffic policers and 
        filter policies 
         
    7. Multicast SDN Framework Architectural Components 
      
      Multicast Service Edge (MSE):  
      An MSE connects to tenant end systems (TESs) (hosts) on the 
      access side and to an underlay IP network or IP/MPLS network on 
      the network side. In the forwarding plane, When an MSE receives 
      a user IP multicast packet from a TES on the access side, it 
      replicates the packet on local ports with TES receivers, and 
      encapsulates the IP multicast packet in a unicast packet to a 
      Multicast Service Node (MSN) or a Multicast Border Gateway 
      (MBG) to reach remote multicast receivers. It also receives IP 
      multicast packets encapsulated in unicast packets on the 
      network side, decapsulates the multicast packets and replicates 
      them on local ports to corresponding TES receivers. In the 
      control plane, an MSE connects to a multicast controller that 
      programs the MSE with multicast forwarding entries triggered by 
      management entities or dynamic control protocols. An MSE may 
      receive IGMP or Multicast Listener Discovery protocol (MLD) 
      report/leave packets on the access side. The MSE acts as an 
      IGMP/MLD proxy and sends messages to the multicast SDN 
      controller to inform the controller of local multicast receivers
      for a multicast group or channel. It may also be statically 
      programmed with multicast entries. An MSE supporting multi-tenancy
      provides for multicast control and forwarding in a tenant specific
      virtual routing and forwarding context. It can be implemented in
      hardware or software. For example, it can be part of a virtual 
      router in a virtualized environment, a kernel or user-plane 
      routing function in physical servers, a physical router, or
      appliance which performs multicast service functions.

    Internet-Draft         SDN Multicast Overlay            July 2017 
     
      There are multiple ways an MSE can intercept multicast control 
      messages and multicast data packets from TESs when the TESs
      are receivers and senders, respectively: 
       - MSE is a multicast router on local VLAN 
       - MSE is a designated multicast router for a LAN router. A LAN 
        router (e.g., a Top of rack (ToR) router in a DC) forwards 
        all multicast packets it receives to a designated MSE  
       - MSE is part of virtual switch/router on a virtualized host 
       - MSE is a kernel function and intercepts data frames 
       - MSE resides in a NIC of the TES and intercepts all frames in 
        and out of the NIC. 
       - MSE is a customer edge (CE) router for a local site.  
       
      Multicast Tunnel TES (MT-TES):
      An MT-TES is a tenant end system (host), virtual or physical, 
      that may send or receive multicast packets encapsulated in  
      unicast IP/UDP packets and delivers them to local applications 
      based on the UDP port number in the encapsulating header or 
      multicast destination address.  
	
      Multicast Service Node (MSN):  
      An MSN is the network entity that receives and replicates 
      IP/Multicast packets from/to others MSNs, MBGs, MSEs and MT-
      TESs in the data plane. An MSN is often designated to serve an 
      MSE with multicast receivers and senders, and/or MT-TESs. There 
      could be more than one MSN serving the same MSE or the same MT-
      TES. In that case, the selection of the MSN can be based on 
      whether the MSE or MT-TES is sending or receiving multicast 
      packets to/from the network, and/or multicast group address or 
      multicast channel based on the tuple multicast source (S) and 
      multicast group address (G). An MSN may tunnel packets over the 
      underlay network to other MSNs and MBGs using unicast 
      tunnels/unicast header encapsulation, or may forward multicast 
      packets natively on the underlay. An MSN always forwards 
      multicast traffic encapsulated in unicast packets to MSEs and 
      MT-TESs as programmed. On the network side, an MSN may 
      participate in native IP multicast control and forwarding if so 
      configured. The multicast controller MAY also program underlay 
      multicast forwarding entries and the forwarding unicast entries 
      that correspond to the unicast forwarding information in the 
      encapsulating header of the packet carrying multicast packets 
      on the MSN for policy-based routing and forwarding purposes. 
      Alternatively, the unicast packets, encapsulating the multicast

    Internet-Draft         SDN Multicast Overlay            July 2017 
     
      packets, can be forwarded based on underlay dynamic unicast 
      routing, the default behavior. Unlike MSE, MSN does not connect 
      to access networks or TESs. MSN can optimize replication based on
      latency, bandwidth, QoS, number of multicast states desired or 
      even more specific multicast application requirements. 
      MSN can be implemented in hardware or software. For example, it 
      can be a physical router, or a software appliance which performs 
      multicast service functions. Each MSN has a forwarding plane and
      a control plane, albeit new control plane functionality and 
      traditional control plane functionality implemented today are
      relegated to an SDN multicast controller. 
 
      Multicast SDN Domain (MSD):  
      A multicast SDN domain encompasses forwarding nodes (MSEs, 
      MSNs, and MBGs) and a cluster of one or more multicast SDN 
      controllers that control the programming of tenant multicast 
      forwarding entries on these nodes in addition to underlay core 
      nodes that provide for IP connectivity among these nodes. 

      Multicast Border Gateway (MBG):  
      An MBG is a network forwarding node that sits at the border of 
      a multicast SDN domain and connects to other networks in 
      different domains, which could be either multicast SDN domains 
      or traditional networks with multicast capabilities in the same 
      or different administrative domains. An MBG forwards multicast 
      packets from one domain to another across the boundary and 
      forwards packets to MSNs within its domain. An MBG could also 
      implement MSN functionality, serving MSEs and MT-TESs. As an 
      example, in cloud networking whereby the cloud is composed of 
      multiple data centers (DCs), an MBG may perform the function of 
      a DC multicast gateway to the WAN to provide for the forwarding 
      of multicast traffic originated by one TES in one DC to TESs 
      located in other DCs. In this case, the MBG may use BGP/MPLS 
      Multicast VPN (BGP-MVPN) [RFC 6513] across the WAN. Inside a 
      domain, an MBG may be enabled with traditional IP multicast 
      control and forwarding on the network underlay links to perform 
      underlay multicast forwarding. Alternatively, underlay 
      multicast forwarding entries reachable within the domain may be 
      programmed by the corresponding multicast SDN control plane. 
      Overlay traffic may be tunneled to/from the MBG using unicast 
      tunnels/unicast-header encapsulation or multicast 
      tunnels/multicast header encapsulation. 
      
      An MBG can be implemented in hardware or software. For example, 
      it can be a physical router, or a software appliance which 
      performs multicast service functions albeit new control plane

      functionality and traditional control plane functional 
      implemented today are relegated to an SDN multicast controller.  
   
      Core Node (CN):  
      A CN is a routing node which provides the underlay
      interconnectivity among the MSEs, MSNs and MBGs. It provides for
      unicast IP, MPLS, and SR forwarding and may provide multicast IP,
      MPLS and/or BIER forwarding.  
       
    8. SDN Multicast Framework 
      Figure 1 depicts the SDN multicast framework, specifically the 
      SDN management plane, control plane and data plane functional 
      elements and their interactions. In the full SDN model, control 
      of any data plane element for multicast is under the control of 
      the Multicast SDN control plane. Variants of this model that 
      leverage existing solutions (e.g., BGP-MVPN) are described in 
      this document to fit different deployment models.

    8.1. SDN Multicast Operational Models 
     8.1.1. Full Multicast SDN Model Operational Overview 

      This section provides an overview of the full SDN multicast 
      model and describes the transactions and information that needs 
      to be exchanged across the different interfaces, including the 
      interfaces between the multicast SDN controller and the various 
      multicast nodes (MSE, MSN, CN, MBG).  Throughout this section 
      it should be assumed that all multicast operations on any of 
      the edge nodes are done in a tenant context.  In the case of 
      multi-tenancy, MSEs, MSNs and MBGs must be able to perform 
      destination lookup and forwarding in a virtual routing and 
      forwarding (VRF) context. In addition, they must be able to 
      encapsulate the original multicast packet with a unicast 
      (tunnel) header and additional header information that carries
      a tenant identifier that can be used to identify the forwarding
      context at the receiving end. 

      Senders and receivers for a multicast group may be static or
      dynamic. For each tenant and multicast group, the SDN multicast 
      controller is informed of the sender(s) via the controller 
      northbound management interface (MApp-C) or the MSE connected 
      to the sender(s) via the MSE-C interface. The SDN controller, 
      in the generic case, will select an MSN that will proxy the MSE 
      connected to the sender, and programs the MSE to send the 
      multicast group traffic it receives from the sender(s) to the 
      selected MSN. The SDN controller may select more than one such 
      MSN. The multicast group packets will be delivered to tenant 
      end systems served by other MSEs and MSNs from these selected 
      MSNs. For static TES multicast receivers on a particular group 
      or channel, the SDN controller knows which TESs are members of 
      a multicast group/channel via the MApp-C management interface, 
      and learns the MSE serving the TES via the MApp-C management 
      interface or via dynamic routing. Then for each TES on that 
      multicast group, The SDN controller selects the MSN to serve 
      the corresponding MSE. This selection could be based on certain 
     
    Qi-Bitar               Expires January 2018           [ Page 16] 
       










    Internet-Draft         SDN Multicast Overlay            July 2017 
     
      criteria that optimize for bandwidth utilization on the path 
      between the MSN and the MSE, and/or resource utilization on the
      MSN among others. Once an MSN selection is done to serve the 
      MSE, the SDN multicast controller needs to ensure that the
      selected MSN receives the multicast group/channel traffic. The
      SDN controller then selects the remote MSN from which it wants
      to receive the multicast group packets. This latter selection 
      could be based on bandwidth utilization on the path between the 
      two MSNs in question, remote MSN resources, and/or the 
      transport method (multicast or unicast tunnel/tunneling 
      encapsulation). In the case of unicast transport, the remote 
      MSN proxying the sender MSE is programmed via the MSN-C interface 
      with a forwarding entry that results in encapsulating the 
      multicast group packets with a unicast SR, IP or MPLS tunnel or 
      encapsulation header that delivers the packets to the MSN serving
      the receiver MSE. The MSN serving the receiver MSE is also
      programmed with an entry that results in forwarding the received
      multicast packet over another tunnel encapsulation to the 
      destination MSE. Optionally, the MSN serving the receiver MSE may 
      be programmed with the tunnel/encapsulation header information 
      over which the multicast group packets will be delivered (i.e., 
      the sender MSN IP address or MPLS tunnel). Unicast forwarding is 
      based on dynamic routing information, static (policy-based) 
      routing or MPLS signaling in the case of RSVP-TE. In the case of 
      multicast transport, the SDN controller may choose to add a new 
      multicast tree branch to an existing multicast tree or re-compute 
      a new one rooted at the sender. In the case of IP multicast 
      transport, and in the absence of PIM in the core, the SDN 
      controller programs the CNs on the path with the appropriate 
      multicast forwarding entries. The MSE could also optionally be 
      programmed with the tunnel/header encapsulation information over 
      which packets are to be received.  
      
      For dynamic receivers, a TES may initiate an IGMP report or MLD 
      join message for a multicast group. That message should be 
      received by the MSE. The MSE may act as an IGMP proxy/MLD proxy 
      in which case the MSE, upon receiving the first join message 
      from a connected TES for a multicast group/channel, sends a 
      join message for that multicast group/channel with tenant 
      context to the SDN controller over the MSE-C interface. In 
      case there is requirement for entitlement or bandwidth 
      admission control, the MSE always sends a message to the SDN 
      controller over the MSE-C interface, requesting admission 
      control for the requesting TES for the particular 
      group/channel, including the tenant context. If the request is 
      admitted, the MSE is informed of the admission decision and the 
      transport path setup proceeds as described for the static

      receiver case. In the proxy case, when the last receiver leaves 
      a multicast group on the MSE either via an explicit leave, 
      failure to respond to a query or failing, the MSE sends a message 
      to the SDN controller that it no longer has receivers for that 
      group/channel via the MSE-C interface, and the controller may 
      remove the MSN as being a receiver for that group/channel and 
      take appropriate action removing associated forwarding state on 
      other nodes (MSNs, CNs).  
       
      8.1.2. Hybrid Distributed-SDN Multicast Model Operational 
             Overview 
      In this model, MSNs and MBGs perform the role of an BGP-MVPN PE 
      with a distributed BGP-MPLS control plane for exchanging 
      receiver information in a tenant network (MVPN) with other MSNs 
      and MBGs. The programmability of the MSNs with the receiver 
      information is done via the SDN controller to create the 
      relevant BGP policies and enable tunneling of multicast traffic 
      to served MSEs.  
       
      8.1.3. Cut-Through Operational Mode 
      In the cut-through model, a sender MSE can send multicast 
      packets directly to remote receiver MSE(s), bypassing MSNs and 
      MBGs.  That is, MSNs do not proxy for downstream MSEs. In this 
      case, the multicast SDN controller programs a sender MSE via 
      the MSE-C interface with a forwarding entry that results in 
      encapsulating the multicast group packets received at the MSE 
      from the access network with a unicast IP header and a tenant 
      identifier that delivers these packets to remote receiver 
      MSE(s). The receiver MSE is also programmed with an entry that 
      results in forwarding the received multicast packet to 
      downstream multicast receivers. Similarly, Sender MSE can send 
      multicast packets directly to receiver MT-TESs with the same 
      operational procedures. 
       
      It should be noted that upon operator configuration, a 
      multicast deployment MAY include one or more of the operational 
      models described in the SDN multicast framework section.

    Internet-Draft         SDN Multicast Overlay            July 2017 
     
    8.2. SDN Multicast Overlay Control Plane Functionalities 
      Multicast control is traditionally distributed on network 
      routing elements, and mainly responsible for building and 
      maintaining multicast distribution trees or transport, and 
      configuring the multicast forwarding plane. Control Plane 
      entities may exchange multicast sender or receiver-membership 
      information with each other using network protocols such as MP-
      BGP or PIM. The full multicast SDN model described in this 
      document alleviates the distributed control plane functions 
      from network elements but preserves the functionalities needed 
      to discover multicast membership and source information, build 
      multicast distribution trees and/or multicast transport 
      tunnels. 

      The SDN Multicast Control plane in the full multicast SDN model 
      Must include the following functionalities: 

      - Unicast topology discovery interconnecting MSEs, MBGs, MSNs 
         and CNs  
      - Multicast topology discovery including MSEs, MSNs, MBGs, and 
        CNs enabled for multicast 
      - Resource utilization monitoring on links and nodes 
      - Multicast group membership discovery and maintenance 
      - Multicast source discovery and maintenance 
      - Multicast distribution tree creation and maintenance 
      - Multicast path selection, instantiation, maintenance and 
        failover 
      - Multicast forwarding programmability 
         
      The SDN Multicast control plane SHOULD include the following 
      functionalities 

      - Entitlement admission control 
      - Bandwidth Admission control 
         
      8.2.1. Unicast Topology Discovery 
      The unicast Topology is needed to discover reachability among 
      MSEs, MSNs and MBGs for MSN selection or MBG selection.  In 
      addition, the unicast topology will be needed if traffic is to 
      be carried using any unicast tunneling technology (IP, MPLS, SR 
      with IP or MPLS data planes), or pt-to-pt RSVP-TE. In this  
     
    Qi-Bitar               Expires January 2018           [ Page 21] 
       










    Internet-Draft         SDN Multicast Overlay            July 2017 
     
      latter case the TE tunnels may be computed by the underlying 
      router. Alternatively, the TE tunnels paths MAY be computed by the 
      SDN controller. The same may apply for Traffic engineered SR 
      paths. The SDN control plane SHOULD always maintain a database of 
      these TE tunnels/paths and associated capacity, irrespective 
      how they are computed, enabling the SDN controller to 
      selectively bind multicast traffic to TE paths. The SDN 
      multicast control plane and network elements that will be used 
      to learn the unicast topology SHOULD support BGP-LS [RFC 7752] or 
      YANG topology data models [Yang-Topology-Model]. The SDN control 
      plane SHOULD learn the unicast topology via BGP-LS or YANG from 
      the network nodes. The SDN controller MUST also learn TES 
      reachability via MSEs using same mechanisms. 
      
      8.2.2. Multicast Topology Discovery 
      The SDN multicast control plane MUST have knowledge of all the 
      MSNs, MBGs and MSEs and their multicast resources. In case the 
      core network is also enabled for multicast and the SDN control 
      plane is to compute multicast trees, the SDN control plane MUST 
      know which nodes are enabled for multicast forwarding and 
      enabled for PIM. The Multicast topology is used by the 
      multicast SDN control plane to select MSNs and MBGs and to 
      compute multicast tree paths. The multicast tree could be based 
      on native IP multicast or pt-to-mpt RSVP-TE. The SDN multicast 
      control plane MUST maintain the computed paths and the 
      receivers and senders mapped to them.   
      
      8.2.3. Resource Utilization Monitoring 
      The SDN control plane MUST maintain knowledge of the available 
      resources on the nodes that may be impacted resource-wise by 
      being on multicast paths selected by the SDN controller. For 
      instance, the SDN controller MUST maintain the available 
      resources for multicast forwarding entries on MSEs, MSNs and 
      MBGs. In addition, if bandwidth and link utilization is to be 
      considered as part of the path selection, the SDN controller 
      MUST maintain knowledge of the utilization on network links. 
      
      8.2.4. Multicast Group Membership Discovery 
      The SDN Controller MUST learns via the MApp-C management 
      interfaces or the MSE-C/MTTES-C interfaces the receivers and 
      senders for each multicast group or channel.

      When the list of multicast receivers and senders for each 
      multicast group in a tenant network is known in advance and 
      when multicast session establishment (set of senders and 
      receivers for a multicast group) can be set up ahead of time of 
      actual multicast data delivery, applications can use the 
      multicast SDN controller northbound interface (MApp-C) to 
      populate the list of receivers and senders for the multicast 
      group in the SDN controller. The SDN controller may also have 
      access to a database, or be programmed with information via 
      MApp-C, that associates the receivers and senders with MSEs. 
      
      8.2.5. Multicast Sender Discovery 
      The multicast SDN controller MUST learn the set of senders for 
      each multicast group. This information May be learned via the 
      MSE-C/MTTES-C interfaces from MSEs or TESs, or via the MApp-C 
      interface from a management application. The SDN controller 
      could obtain the location of the sender (which MSE a sender is 
      connected to) from routing information, or via MApp-C and MSE-C 
      interfaces.  
      
      8.2.6. Multicast Distribution Tree Creation and Maintenance 
      The SDN controller MUST be able to compute a multicast 
      distribution tree. There could be several segments for a 
      multicast distribution tree depending on the capabilities
      of the network elements, and/or the operator design. Following 
      are the distribution tree types:
 
      1- Distribution Tree Type 1: The distribution tree is rooted at 
        one MSN that receives a multicast group source traffic from 
        an MSE. Then, that MSN encapsulates the multicast traffic 
        with a unicast tunneling header to other MSNs connected to 
        MSEs with receiver TESs for that group, and to other MBGs to 
        reach TES receivers in other domains. 
      2- Distribution Tree Type 2: The distribution Tree is rooted at 
        one MSN that receives a multicast group source traffic from 
        an MSE. Then, the MSN encapsulates the traffic with a 
        multicast tunneling header or in a multicast tunnel with 
        leaves being other MSNs and MBGs to reach receivers.  When an 
        MSN receives the tenant multicast traffic on a multicast 
        tunnel/encapsulated in a multicast tunneling header, it 
        decapsulates the tenant multicast packets and unicast tunnel 
        them to the MSEs with receiver TESs for that group.

      In computing the multicast tree, the SDN controller SHOULD take 
      into account constraints on bandwidth and other QoS parameters 
      such as latency, jitter and packet loss in addition to the 
      capabilities of the forwarding plane elements (e.g., native 
      multicast replication support, multicast replication over 
      unicast tunnels, number of multicast entries, bandwidth, etc.) 
      and policies (e.g., which MSN is to serve which MSE, inter-SDN 
      domain policies etc.). A multicast distribution tree is 
      recomputed every time that there is a new edge node (MSE, MSN 
      or MBG) to be added to the multicast tree, or there is an edge 
      node that needs to be pruned out of the multicast tree), adding 
      or removing multicast branches to/from the tree. 
     
      An SDN multicast controller can map tenant overlay multicast 
      group addresses 1:1 to distinct multicast group addresses in 
      native IP multicast underlay, and program MSNs and MBGs with 
      the appropriate forwarding information. An SDN multicast 
      controller can alternatively map each designated set of tenant 
      overlay multicast group addresses to a unique underlay 
      multicast IP address and accordingly program MSNs and MBGs with 
      the appropriate forwarding information. In this latter case, 
      these tenant overlay multicast groups are aggregated into 
      distinct multicast group address(es) similar to mechanisms in 
      Default or Data MDTs (Multicast Distribution Trees) [RFC 6037].  
      This aggregation technique can help minimize multicast routing 
      states in native multicast network. 
       
      8.2.7. Multicast Forwarding Programmability 
      Subsequent to the (re-) computation of the multicast tree, the 
      SDN multicast controller MUST be able to program the multicast 
      forwarding entries on the forwarding elements: MSE, MSN and 
      MBG. When supporting dynamic receivers and senders, multicast 
      tree (re-)computation and programmability must be done 
      relatively fast so that it does not impact the user experience, 
      creating a significant delay in starting to receive a multicast 
      channel that the user joins. In other cases, multicast receiver 
      applications may also have a requirement on the latency between 
      sending a join to a multicast channel and starting to receive 
      data on that channel. Among other things, forwarding 
      programmability SHOULD enable setting the TTL treatment 
      behavior. Specifically, an ingress MBG SHOULD be configurable

      not to copy the Time to Live (TTL) field from SDN overlay 
      multicast packets.  Operators should take account of the 
      end-to-end network topology and set the TTL field accordingly. 
       
      8.2.8. Entitlement Admission Control 
      When this function is enabled for a given tenant, the SDN 
      multicast controller checks if the requesting receiver is 
      entitled to receive the content of the multicast group/channel 
      it is requesting to join. The SDN controller MAY be programmed 
      with the list of receivers that are allowed to receive traffic 
      from certain source(s), and whereby the receivers may be 
      identified by IP host addresses, IP subnets or other types of 
      identifiers. This entitlement information can be configured on 
      the controller or it may be available through some database or 
      system that has that information. 
       
      8.2.9. Bandwidth Admission Control 
      Bandwidth admission control prevents content or subscription 
      overload from senders or receivers as well as provides 
      important security protection by putting upper limits on how 
      much traffic each sender or receiver can send or subscribe to. 
      When this function is enabled, the SDN multicast controller 
      may perform bandwidth admission control when permitting a 
      channel to be delivered to a TES and/or when selecting the 
      multicast channel path. The specification of bandwidth 
      admission control mechanisms is beyond the scope of this 
      framework.  
       
    8.3. Multicast Functional Components Implementation 
      MSE, MSN and MBG are functional components that may be co-
      located on the same router and implemented in different forms 
      (physical, virtual, or applications).  For example, MSEs and 
      MSNs can co-locate together in the same physical or virtual 
      router.

    8.4. SDN Multicast Management Interfaces 
      8.4.1. North-Bound Interface 
      MApp-C is a northbound interface from the SDN controller that 
      provides management applications the means to interact with the 
      SDN controller to set and extract multicast configurations and 
      information, respectively.  It is independent of individual 
      network devices, vendors or device types. MApp-C interface 
      SHOULD provide a comprehensive and flexible data model and 
      messaging methods that allow these applications to access 
      Multicast SDN Controllers to request the addition or removal of 
      a receiver to a multicast (S,G) channel, the establishment of a 
      multicast distribution tree between specified senders and 
      receivers with potential constraints on bandwidth and QoS for 
      instance, set entitlement rules, and obtain state information 
      pertinent to a multicast group or participants in that multicast 
      group among others. Applications SHOULD have a means to perform
      these actions across MSDs, each with an SDN controller, with one 
      action rather than separate actions initiated with each of the 
      MSD controllers. 
      
      8.4.2. Multicast SDN Functional Component Facing Interfaces 
      
      MTTES-C, MSE-C, MSN-C, MBG-C are interfaces between a Multicast 
      SDN Controller on one hand and TESs and Multicast 
      SDN forwarding functional components on the other hand. Each 
      interface is specific to the associated functional component, 
      and is used to provide control plane and/or data plane 
      programming of that component and to harness information from 
      that component. 
       
      8.4.3. Traditional Underlay Network Element Interfaces 
     
      CN-C is the interface between Multicast SDN controller and core 
      network elements that provide core forwarding services, as 
      opposed to edge services provided by MSE, MSN and MBG. The 
      purpose of CN-C is to provide for programming of network 
      elements in the core whenever it is possible or necessary, and 
      to extract operational state information from these elements.

      8.4.4. Information Model and Data Model of Management Interfaces 
      
      Both northbound interface and SDN functional component facing 
      interfaces SHOULD be based on RESTCONF [RESTCONF] or 
      NETCONF [RFC6241]. Their data models should be based on YANG. 
       
    9. SDN Control Plane 
      
      The SDN Control plane can be composed of one or more 
      controllers. These controllers will need to cooperate in the 
      establishment of a multicast distribution tree within MSDs and 
      across MSDs. How they cooperate or interact is dependent on the 
      relationship relative to MSDs, ASes, and administrative 
      entities (operators). In this section, the following cases are 
      considered: 
      1- Intra-MSD, Inter-SDN Controller Interactions 
      2- Inter-MSD, Intra-AS, Inter-SDN Controller Interactions 
      3- Inter-MSD, Inter-AS, Intra-operator, Inter-SDN Controller 
         Interactions 
      4- Inter-MSD, Inter-AS, Inter-operator, Inter-SDN Controller 
        Interactions 
         
      (this section will be completed in a future update). 
    10. Multi-Party Multicast SDN Overlay Interaction 
       
      If multicast senders and receivers are on different multicast 
      SDN overlay vendor solutions, it SHOULD be possible to setup 
      and exchange multicast control states as well as underlying 
      tunneling information. 

    11. Security Considerations 
      Following are the security considerations that pertain to the 
      multicast SDN framework in this document: 
      1- The communication channel between any data element and the 
        SDN controller MUST be trusted and secure, with mutual 
        authentication. This applies to all interfaces (MSE-C, MSN-C, 
        CN-C, MTTES-C and MBG-C) in order is to prevent rogue 
        controllers from hijacking multicast traffic, mounting

    Internet-Draft         SDN Multicast Overlay            July 2017 
     
        security attacks on network elements or leaking tenant 
        multicast traffic to other tenants.  
      2- MSE must have means to cope with tenant end systems 
        misbehavior, malicious or malfunctioning, that may result in 
        control plane attack on the SDN controller, impacting the 
        stability of the system and as a result impacting multicast 
        services. The MSE MUST be able to limit the message rate that 
        could be triggered by tenant end system activity, and the 
        controller MUST be able to limit message rate and routing 
        activity changes at the tenant level as that could result in 
        a DDOS on the multicast services across tenants.  
      3- The association between a TES and tenant network must be 
        authentic so that traffic eavesdropping is prevented and a 
        TES is not allowed to illegally inject multicast traffic into 
        another tenant network. 
      4- The SDN controller SHOULD have the means to authorize a TES 
        to join a multicast channel (entitlement). 
      5- The SDN controller SHOULD have the means to exercise 
        admission control to avoid congestion on network links as 
        causing congestion could be a way to launch a DDOS.
