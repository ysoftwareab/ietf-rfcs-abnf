Abstract

   This memo describes the Open Digital Asset Protocol (ODAP).  ODAP is
   an asset transfer protocol that operates between two gateway devices.
   The protocol includes a description of virtual or digital assets held
   on distributed ledgers in an open and interoperable format, a session
   negotiation part and message passing flows between gateways
   connecting disparate distributed ledger technologies (DLTs).

1.  Introduction

   There is a lack of interoperability between individual blockchains,
   but also a general difficulty building open DLT networks.  Extant
   networks are custom built and relatively closed, usually limited to
   networks of a single DLT type.

   This memo proposes at DLT-agnostic protocol in order to allow the
   creation of business applications that use and modify multiple DLTs,
   through a single programmatic interface.

   The target DLTs can be of any type, operated by different owners and
   managed using different DLT interoperability / management platforms
   that implement ODAP interfaces.

   These platforms may act as gateways or relays for the application to
   interact with the hosted DLTs.  They are referred to herein as DLT
   Gateways.

   When correctly implemented and deployed, the protocol should provide
   the basis for solutions involving asset migration between two DLT
   systems, as well as use-cases when one side is non-DLT system (e.g.
   legacy system).

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS.  Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying significance described in RFC 2119.

3.  Terminology

   The following are some terminology used in the current document.
   Further terminology can be found in [Arch].

   Client application: This is the application employed by a user to
   interact with a gateway node.

   Gateway: The node of the DLT system functionally capable of acting as
   a gateway in an asset transfer.

   Sender gateway: The gateway that initiates a unidirectional asset
   transfer.

   Recipient gateway: The gateway that is the recipient side of a
   unidirectional asset transfer.

   DLT resources: The various interior protocols, data structures and
   cryptographic constructs that are a core part of a DLT system.

   Off-DLT resources: The various resources that are outside a DLT
   system, and are not part of the operations of the DLT system.

   Role: As in the classic client-server roles.  In the gateway-to-
   gateway interaction, one gateway will take the role of the client
   while the other takes the role of the server, depending on the type
   of interaction flow.

   Claim: An assertion made by an Entity [JWT].

   Claim Type: Syntax used for representing a Claim Value [JWT].

   DLT Claim: An assertion made by a Gateway regarding the status or
   condition of resources (e.g. asset, public keys, etc.) accessible to
   that gateway within its DLT system.

4.  The Open Digital Asset Protocol

4.1.  Overview

   The Open Digital Asset Protocol (ODAP) is a gateway-to-gateway
   protocol used by a sender gateway with a recipient gateway to perform
   a unidirectional transfer of a virtual asset [Arch].

   The protocol defines a number of API endpoints, resources and
   identifier definitions, and message flows corresponding to the asset
   transfer between the two gateways.

4.2.  ODAP Model

   Following the gateway interoperability architecture [Arch], the model
   for ODAP is shown in Figure 1.

   The Client (application) interacts with its local gateway (G1) over
   an interface (API Type-1) in order to provide instructions to the
   gateway with regards to actions related resources located in the
   local DLT system (L1) and resources located in remote DLT system
   (L2).

   Gateways interact with each other over a gateway interface (API Type-
   2).  A given gateway may be required to access resources that are not
   located in DLT system L1 or DLT system L2.  Access to these types of
   resources are performed over an Off-DLT interface (API Type-3).

Internet-Draft                    ODAP                     November 2020


4.3.  Types of APIs

   The following are the types of APIs in ODAP:

   o  Gateway APIs for client (API Type-1): This the REST APIs that
      permit a Client (application) to interact with a local gateway,
      and issue instructions for actions pertaining to resources
      accessible to the gateway in the local DLT system.

   o  Gateway APIs for peer gateways (API Type-2): This is the REST APIs
      employed by two (2) peer gateways in performing unidirectional
      asset transfers.

   o  APIs for validation of off-DLT resources (API Type-3): This is the
      REST APIs made available by a resource server (resource owner) at
      which a gateway can access Off-DLT resources.

   The use of these APIs is dependent on the mode of access and the type
   of flow in question.

4.4.  Types of Flows

   The ODAP protocol defines the following three (3) flows:

   o  Transfer Initiation flow: This flow deals with the asset profile
      verification, asset ownership evidence verification and identities
      verification.

   o  Lock-Evidence flow: This flow deals with the conveyance of
      evidence regarding the lock (escrow) status of an asset by one
      gateway, and the verification of the evidence by the other
      gateway.

   o  Commitment Establishment flow: This flow deals with the asset
      transfer and commitment establishment between two gateways on
      behalf of their DLT systems.

   These flow will be discussed below.

4.5.  Resources and Identifiers

   o  (a) Resource addressing for DLTs, using the URL syntax.

   o  (b) Client identification based on the URN format.  These are for
      identifying clients (developers and applications) who access these
      resources, and which in some use-cases require access
      authorization.

Internet-Draft                    ODAP                     November 2020


   o  (c) Protocol message family for negotiating authentication,
      authorisation, and parameters for confidential channel
      establishment.

   o  (d) Resource discovery mechanism for developers and applications
      to discover DLT-based resources hosted at a DLT gateway.  The
      gateway response is subject to the level of access granted to that
      developer or application.

4.6.  Access Modes

   This draft proposes three (3) distinct mode of operation for Clients
   when accessing resources recorded a DLT.  These modes make use of a
   gateway, with the assumption that a gateway has full access to the
   DLT behind the gateway.

4.6.1.  Direct Mode: Simple Client to Gateway

   In this mode, the client uses its local gateway known to the client
   in order to access (e.g. local transactions to) the local DLT.  This
   is shown in Figure 2.

   In the direct mode, the simplest case, a client application interacts
   with a single DLT gateway in order to interact with the DLTs hosted
   behind the gateway.

   The application must be recognized and authorized by the gateway.
   Asset transfers between the DLTs behind the gateway are possible, and
   the set of operations specified in section 5.10 MUST be supported by
   the DLT Gateway.

   Additional operations specific to DLT or Gateway implementations MAY
   also be available.

4.6.2.  Direct Mode: Client to Multiple Gateway

   In this mode, the client is interacting with multiple gateways
   simultaneously in order to access the DLTs behind each of those
   gateways.  The client is assumed to be performing the synchronization
   of actions while interacting these gateways.  This is illustrated in
   Figure 3.

   Direct mode can support connections from a single application to
   multiple DLT gateways.  The applications may assert different
   identities with each gateway, provided it has the relevant
   credentials.

   The applications can interact with the DLTs behind each gateway
   according to the authorizations granted by the gateways.

   Asset transfers between/across DLTs hosted behind different gateways
   are not supported in this mode.

4.6.3.  Relay Mode: Client-initiated Gateway to Gateway

   In this mode, the application interacts with a single Gateway, and
   that Gateway acts as an intermediary to other Gateways.

   Connection types and security methods used in the application to
   gateway connection can differ from those used in the gateway to
   gateway connection(s).  The authorization method and credentials
   presented on behalf of the application must be acceptable to the
   final target gateway(s).

   In Relay Mode, additional functionality is available.  Asset
   transfers, based on a two/three phase commit are available.  These
   rely on evidence of locks on source DLTs, which can be passed from
   Gateway to Gateway, insulating the application from the additional
   complexity and keeping the lock data private from the application.

   Compliant Gateways MUST implement these operations, in order to
   support Relay Mode.

   Multi-hop connections between gateways are out of scope of this
   document.

5.  ODAP Message Format, identifiers and Descriptors

5.1.  Overview

   This section describes (i) the phases of the ODAP protocol; (ii) the
   format of ODAP messages; (iii) the format for resource descriptors;
   (iv) a method for gateways to implement access controls; (iv)
   protocol for negotiating security capabilities; (v) discovery and
   accessing resources and provisions for backward compatibility with
   existing systems.

5.2.  ODAP Message Format

   ODAP messages are exchanged between applications (clients) and DLT
   gateways (servers).  They consist of protocol negotiation and
   functional messages.

   Messages are JSON format, with protocol specific mandatory fields,
   support for arbitrary authentication and authorization schemes and
   support for a free format field for plaintext or encrypted payloads
   directed at the DLT gateway or an underlying DLT.

   JSON format message, mandatory fields are shown below:

   o  Version: ODAP protocol Version (major, minor).

   o  Resource URL: Location of Resource to be accessed.

   o  Developer URN: Assertion of developer / application identity.

   o  Action/Response: GET/POST and arguments (or Response Code)

   o  Credential Profile: Specify type of auth (e.g.  SAML, OAuth,
      X.509)

   o  Credential Block: Credential token, certificate, string

   o  Payload Profile: Asset Profile provenance and capabilities

   o  Application Profile: Vendor or Application specific profile

   o  Payload: Payload for POST, responses, and native DLT txns

   o  Sequence Number: Sequence Number.

5.3.  Digital Asset Resource Descriptors

   Resources are identified by URL [RFC 1738] as described below:

   o  The type is new: application/odapres

   o  The access protocol is ODAP.

   Data included in the URL includes the folowing:

5.3.1.  Organisation Identifier

   This Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) or other identifier linking
   resource ownership to real world entity.  Any scheme for identifying
   DLT Gateway owners may be implemented (e.g.  LEI directory, closed
   user group membership, SWIFT BIC, etc.).

   The developer or application MAY validate the identity with the
   issuing authority.  The identifier is not a trusted identity, but MAY
   be relied on where trust has been established between the two parties
   (e.g. in a closed user group).

   The mechanisms to determine organizations identifiers is out of scope
   for the current specification.

5.3.2.  DLT Gateway / Endpoint ID

   FQDN of the ODAP compliant DLT gateway.  Required to establish IP
   connectivity.  This MUST resolve to a valid IP address.

5.3.3.  DLT Identifier

   Specify to gateway behind which the target DLTs operates.  This field
   is local to the DLT gateway and is used to direct ODAP interactions
   to the correct underlying DLT.

   For example: "Hyperledger1", "Bitcoin, "EU-supply-chain".

5.3.4.  Resource

   Specifies a resource held on the underlying DLT.  This field must be
   meaningful to the DLT in question but is otherwise an arbitrary
   string.  The underlying object it points to may be a DLT address,
   block, transaction ID, alias, etc. or a future object type not yet
   defined.

5.3.5.  Examples

   odapres://quant/api.gateway1.com/ripple

   odapres://quant/api.gateway1.com/bitcoin/xxxxxADDRESSxxxxx

5.4.  Digital Asset Resource Client Descriptors

   Resources are identified by URN as described below:

   o  The type is new: application/odapclient

   The URN format does not imply availability or access protocol.

   Data included in the URN includes the folowing:

5.4.1.  Organization Identifier

   Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) or other identifier linking resource
   ownership to real world entity.  Any scheme for identifying DLT
   Gateway owners may be implemented (e.g.  LEI directory, closed user
   group membership, BIC, etc.).

   The DLT Gateway MAY validate the identity with the issuing authority.
   The identifier is not a trusted identity, but MAY be relied on where
   trust has been established between the two parties (e.g. in a closed
   user group).

5.4.2.  DLT Gateway / Endpoint ID

   Multi-DLT applications can operate in a mode whereby the application
   connects to its local DLT gateway, which then forwards application
   traffic to local DLTs and to remote DLTs via other ODAP gateways.

   Where this is the case, this field identifies the "home" gateway for
   this application.  This may be required to carry out Gateway to
   Gateway handshaking and protocol negotiation, or for the server to
   look up use case specific data relating to the client.

5.4.3.  Organizational Unit

   The organization unit within the organization that the client
   (application or developer) belongs to.  This assertion should be
   backed up with authentication via the negotiated protocol.

   The purpose of this field is to allow DLT gateways to maintain access
   control mapping between applications and resources that are
   independent of the authentication and authorization schemes used,

   supporting future changes and supporting counterparties that operate
   different schemes.

5.4.4.  Name

   A locally unique (within the OU) identifier, which can identify the
   application, project or individual developer responsible for this
   client connection.  This is the most granular unit of access control,
   and DLT Gateways should ensure appropriate identifiers are used for
   the needs of the application or use case.

5.4.5.  Examples

   odapclient:quant/api.overledger.quant.com/research/luke.riley

5.5.  Gateway Level Access Control

   Gateways can enforce access rules based on standard naming
   conventions using novel or existing mechanisms such as AuthZ
   protocols using the resource identifiers above, for example:

   odapclient://hsbc/api.overledger.hsbc.com/lending/eric.devloper

   can READ/WRITE

   odapres://quant/api.gateway1.com/bitcoin

   AND

   odapres://quant/api.gateway1.com/ripple

   These rules would allow a client so identified to access resources
   directly, for example:

   odapres://quant/api.gateway1.com/bitcoin/xxxxxADDRESSxxxxx

   This example could be an client subscribing to or writing to an
   address associated with a smart contract as part of its
   functionality.

   This method allows resource owners to easily grant access to
   individuals, groups and organizations.  Individual gateway
   implementations may implement access controls, including subsetting
   and supersetting or applications or resources according to their own
   requirements.

5.6.  Negotiation of Security Protocols and Parameters

5.6.1.  TLS Established

   TLS 1.2 or higher MUST be implemented to protect gateway
   communications.  TLS 1.3 or higher SHOULD be implemented where both
   gateways support TLS 1.3 or higher.

5.6.2.  Client offers supported credential schemes

   Capability negotiation prior to data exchange, follows a scheme
   similar to the Session Description Protocol [RFC 5939].  Initially
   the client (application) sends a JSON block containing acceptable
   credential schemes, e.g.  OAuth2.0, SAML in the "Credential Scheme"
   field of the ODAP message.

5.6.3.  Server selects supported credential scheme

   The server (DLT Gateway) selects one acceptable credential scheme
   from the offered schemes, returning the selection in the "Credential
   Scheme" field of the ODAP message.

   If no acceptable credential scheme was offered, an HTPP 511 "Network
   Authentication Required" error is returned in the Action/Response
   field of the ODAP message.

5.6.4.  Client asserts of proves identity

   The details of the assertion / verification step are specific to the
   chosen credential scheme and are out of scope of this document.

5.6.5.  Sequence numbers initialized

   Sequence numbers are used to allow the server to correctly order
   operations from the client, some of which may be asynchronous,
   synchronous, idempotent with duplicate requests handled in different
   ways according to the use case.

   The initial sequence number is proposed by the client (Application)
   after the finalization of credential verification.  The server (DLT
   gateway) MUST respond with the same sequence number to indicate
   acceptance.

   The client (application) increments the sequence number with each new
   request.  Sequence numbers can be reused for retries in the event of
   a gateway timeout.

5.6.6.  Messages can now be exchanged

   Handshaking is complete at this point, and the client (application)
   can send ODAP messages to perform actions of DLT resources, which MAY
   reference the ODAP Payload field.

5.7.  Asset Profile Negotiation

   TBD

5.8.  Application Profile Negotiation

   Where an application relies on specific extensions for operation,
   these can be represented in an Application Profile.

   For example, a payments application tracks payments through the use
   of a cloud based API and will only interact with Gateways that log
   messages to that API, a resource profile can be established:

   Application Name: TRACKER

   X-Tracker_URL: https://api.tracker.com/updates

   X-Tracking-Policy: Always

   As Gateways implement this functionality, they support the TRACKER
   application profile, and the application is able to expand its reach
   by periodically polling for the availability of the profile.

   This is an intentionally generalized extension mechanism for
   application or vendor specific functionality.

5.9.  Digital Asset Resource Discovery

   Applications MUST be able to discover which resources they are
   authorized to access to the level of individual DLTs.  They MAY be
   able to discover lower level resources.

   Resource discovery is handled by the DLT gateway, for instance a GET
   request against the gateway URL with no DLT or resource could return
   a list of URLs available to the requester to DLT level.  This list is
   subject to the access controls above.

   DLT Gateways MAY allow applications to discover resources they do not
   have access to, this should be indicated the free text field, and
   they should implement a process for applications to request access.

   Formal specification of supported resource discovery methods is out
   of scope of this document.

5.10.  Accessing Resources via a DLT Gateway

   The Action field is used to access resources via the gateway.  We
   suggest these interactions use REST semantics however a detailed API
   specification is out of scope of this memo.

   In general, we suggest exposing a common subset of functionality via
   API using the Action field, augmented with DLT specific or smart
   contract specific functionality as needed.

5.10.1.  CREATE

   Create an object on the target DLT.

5.10.2.  WRITE

   Write to a location on the target DLT.

5.10.3.  INVOKE

   Invoke code on the target DLT (typically a smart contract).

5.10.4.  LOCK

   Lock an object on the target DLT.

5.10.5.  UNLOCK

   Unlock an object on the target DLT.

5.10.6.  TRANSFER

   Transfer an object from one DLT to another.

5.10.7.  SUBSCRIBE

   Subscribe to be notified of transaction affecting an object on the
   target DLT.

5.10.8.  DESTROY

   Destroy an object on the target DLT.

Internet-Draft                    ODAP                     November 2020


5.10.9.  READ

   Read an object from the target DLT.

5.10.10.  NATIVE_TXN

   Send a signed native transaction of any kind to the target DLT.
   Payload consists of the native transaction.

5.11.  Response Codes

   The DLT Gateway MUST respond with return codes indicating the failure
   or success of the operation.  For DLTs with slow consensus mechanism,
   the Gateway may return codes indicating the operation has been
   submitted.  The application may carry out further operation in future
   to determine the ultimate status of the operation.

   For Non-native transactions, the Gateway is responsible for
   translating the request into the appropriate native format and
   ensuring correct signing takes place.

5.12.  Backward Compatibility

   It is also possible to send a fully formatted native message to the
   underlying DLT in the Payload field using the NATIVE_TXN operation,
   directed to a resource URL.  This allows existing DLT native code to
   be ported to ODAP infrastructures with minimal change.

6.  Transfer Initiation Flow (Phase 1)

   TBD.

7.  Lock-Evidence Verification Flow (Phase 2)

   This section describes the conveyance of claims regarding to the
   status of assets or resources from a sender gateway to a recipient
   gateway.

   In the following, the sender gateway takes the role of the client
   while the recipient gateway takes the role of the server.

   The client makes a request (POST) to the Transfer Request Endpoint
   (API Type-3) at the server gateway.

   Gateways as servers MUST support the use of the HTTP GET and POST
   methods defined in RFC 2616 [RFC2616] at the Transfer Request
   Endpoint and the Evidence Validation Endpoint.

   Clients MAY use the HTTP GET or POST methods to send the Transfer
   Commence Request or the Evidence Validation Request to the Recipient
   Server.  If using the HTTP GET method, the request parameters maybe
   serialized using URI Query String Serialization.

   The client and server may be required to sign certain messages in
   order to provide standalone proof (for non-repudiation) independent
   of the secure channel between the client and server.  This proof
   maybe required for audit verifications post-event.

   (NOTE: nonces are not shown).

8.  Commitment Establishment Flow (Phase 3)

   TBD.

9.  Security Consideration

   Although the current interoperability architecture for blockchain
   gateways assumes the externalization of the value of assets, as a
   blockchain system holds an increasing number of virtual assets it
   becomes attractive to attackers seeking to obtain cryptographic keys
   of its nodes and its end-users.

   Gateway nodes are of particular interest to attackers because they
   enable the transferal of virtual assets to external blockchain
   systems, which may or may not be regulated.  As such, hardening
   technologies and tamper-resistant crypto-processors (e.g.  TPM, SGX)
   should be used for implementations of gateways [HS19].

   Due to the consensus-based nature of the underlying DLT technologies,
   gateway responses may be conditional and require verification, for
   instance if the DLT is undergoing a byzantine attack at the time of
   the request.

   The application must evaluate the correctness of responses from the
   gateway in context and may need to perform further verification steps
   with later ODAP calls.  The application may base this evaluation on
   the number of DLT nodes the gateway has interacted with in order to
   fulfil the request.

10.  IANA Consideration

   (TBD)
