1.  Introduction

   The Hirarchical Mobile IPv6 Mobility Management [HMIPv6] did not
   specify nor favor any particular mechanism for establishing a
   Security Association (SA) between the Mobile Node (MN) and the
   Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) located within an HMIPv6 domain.

   This memo describes a method allowing to establish an SA between the
   MN and the selected MAP.  The suggested solution is based on
   combining the Cyptographically Generated Addresses [CGA] and Crypto-
   Based Identifiers [CBID].

3.  Glossary

   Access Router

      The Access Router is the Mobile Node's default router.  The AR
      aggregates the outband traffic of mobile nodes.

   Mobility Anchor Point (MAP)

      A Mobility Anchor Point is a router located in a network visited
      by the mobile node, which is used by the MN as a local Home Agent
      (HA).

   Regional Care-of Address (RCoA)

      A Regional Care-of Address is an address obtained by the MN from
      the visited network.  An RCoA is an address on the MAP's subnet
      and is auto-configured by the MN when receiving the MAP option.

   On-link Care-of Address (LCoA)

      The LCoA is the on-link CoA configured on a mobile node's
      interface based on the prefix advertised by its default router.

   Local Binding Update (LBU) Message

      The MN sends a Local Binding Update message to the MAP in order to
      establish a binding between the RCoA and the LCoA.

   Pre-Binding Update (PBU) Message

      The MN's default router sends a Pre-Binding Update message to the
      MAP upon receiving a Router Solicitation (RtSol) message carrying
      a 128-bit CBID and a valid CGA signature.

   Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA)

      A technique described in [CGA] whereby an IPv6 address of a node
      is cryptographically generated by using a one-way hash function
      from the node's public key (Kp) and some other parameters.

   Crypto-Based Identifier (CBID)

      A technique described in [CBID] whereby a non-routable identifier
      is cryptographically generated by using a one-way hash function
      from the node's public key and an imprint.

   Binding Acknowledgment (BA) Message

      The MAP sends a binding acknowledgment message to the MN in
      response to an LBU message.

4.  Proposed Solution

   We assume that the MN's LCoA is always computed based on the CGA
   technology, in order to allow the MN to run the secure neighbor
   discovery protocol described in [SEND].  Such assumption has also
   been made in [FMIPsec], in order to provide a security mechanism for
   the [FMIPv6] protocol and in the [OptiSEND] protocol, in order to
   optimize SEND.

   In addition, we assume that the MN can discover the presence of an
   HMIPv6 domain before sending a RtSol message, e.g., by using
   technologies described in [FRD].  However, the proposed solution
   works without such assumption.  In fact, our motivation behind the
   FRD protocol aims above all to reduce the handoff latency.
   Based on that, we suppose in the following and as an example only
   that an FRD technology is implemented in all Access Points (APs).

   The suggested solution introduces a new signaling message, i.e., the
   Pre-Binding Update (PBU) message, which is sent by the AR to the MAP
   upon receiving a RtSol message from the MN, which carries a valid
   signature (i.e., the message is signed with the MN's CGA private key)
   and a 128-bit CBID.
   Note that the Crypto-based ID (CBID) is used to provide the MAP
   sufficient proof of ownership of the MN's suggested RCoA.

   The following figure shows the signaling diagram for establishing a
   bidirectional SA between the MN and the MAP:

   1.  MN to AR:  Router Solicitation [CGA Signature + CBID] (RtSol)
   2a. AR to MN:  Router Acknowledgement [Ks] (RtAdv)
   2b. AR to MAP: Pre-Binding Update [Ks + Kp + LCoA + CBID] (PBU)
   3.  MN to MAP: Local Binding Update [DH value (X)] (LBU)
   4.  MAP to MN: Binding Acknowledgment [HKs + DH value (Y)] (BA)

   The suggested solution is described in the following steps:

   o  When the MN discovers that it has entered an HMIPv6 domain, it
      computes an LCoA address by using its CGA key pair, and a 128-bit
      CBID by hashing the CGA public key (Kp) together with a 64-bit
      imprint.

   o  The MN inserts the CBID in a new option (Crypto-Identifier Option
      (CIO)), which is carried by the RtSol message, then signs the
      message as described in SEND and sends it to the AR.

   o  Upon receiving a valid unicast RtSol message carrying a CBID, the
      AR replies immediately by sending a unicast RtAdv message to the
      MN and in parallel, a PBU message to the MAP.  For this purpose,



Haddad, et al.          Expires September 7, 2006               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                  HMIPv6sec                     March 2006


      the AR MUST compute a secret (Ks), encrypts it with the MN's CGA
      public key and sends it in the unicast RtAdv message.  The shared
      secret is inserted in a new option (Third Party Shared Key
      (TSPK)), which is carried by the unicast RtAdv message.
      The AR MUST also send Ks to the MAP in the PBU message, in
      addition to sending the MN's CGA public key, its LCoA and CBID.
      Note that it is assumed that the PBU messages are signed by the
      ARs and the paths between the ARs and the MAP are secure.

   o  After receiving the PBU message, the MAP creates a BCE for the MN,
      in which it stores the LCoA, Ks and the CGA public key carried by
      the PBU message.  Once the BCE is created, the MAP waits for a
      limited amount of time for the owner of the LCoA to send the LBU
      message.

   o  When the MN gets a valid RtAdv message, it configures its RCoA by
      using as interface identifier (IID), the 64-bit imprint, which has
      been used to generate the CBID.  Then, it initiates a Diffie-
      Hellman (DH) procedure with the MAP by sending its DH public value
      (X) in a new option (Session Mobility Secret (SMS)), which is
      carried by the first LBU message sent to the MAP.  The first LBU
      message is also used to request the MAP to bind its LCoA to its
      new RCoA.

   o  Upon receiving an LBU message, the MAP searches its BCEs table for
      an LCoA, which matches the one sent in the LBU message.  If the
      same LCoA is found, then the MAP hashes the RCoA IID, i.e., the
      imprint, with the stored CGA public key and compares it to the
      CBID.  If the two hash values are the same, then the MAP completes
      the DH exchange by sending its own DH public value (Y) in a new
      option (MAP Session Mobility Secret (MSMS)), which is carried by
      the BA message sent to the MN.  In addition, the MAP MUST send in
      the BA message the hash of Ks (i.e., hash(Ks) = HKs), which will
      be carried in another new option (Third Party Hash Secret (TPHS)).

      By sending (Y) to the MN, the MAP will complete the DH exchange,
      which in turn allows both nodes to compute the session mobility
      key (Ksm), i.e., from values (X) and (Y).
      Note that if the two hash values are not equal then the MAP simply
      discards the LBU message.

   o  When the MN gets a BA message, it searches first if it carries
      HKs.  If the correct HKs is found, then the MN computes Ksm and
      establishes a bidirectional SA with the MAP.

   o  Finally, both nodes MUST use Ksm only to authenticate all
      subsequent LBU/BA messages exchanged between them.

   Note that the SA lifetime is set to 24 hours, after which the MN has
   to request the MAP to renew it.

5.  New Messages and Options Format

   In the following, we describe the PBU message structure and the
   format of the five new options.

5.1.  The Pre-Binding Update (PBU) Message Format

   When the AR receives a RtSol message carrying a valid RSA signature
   and a CBID, it sends a PBU message to the MAP, which carries the MN's
   LCoA, CGA public key, CBID and Ks.

   The format of the PBU message is as follows:


      0                   1                   2                   3

5.5.  Third Party Hash Secret (TPHS) Option

   When sending a BA message carrying an MSS option, the MAP MUST insert
   the hash of Ks (HKs) in the BA message.  For this purpose, the TPHS
   option is used to carry the HKs in the BA message.

   The TPHS option has the following format:


      0                   1                   2                   3

5.6.  The Session Mobility Secret (SMS) Option

   The SMS option is carried by the first LBU message sent by the MN to
   the MAP after receiving an unicast RtAdv message carrying a TPSK
   option.  The SMS option contains the DH public value (X) sent by the
   MN to the MAP to initiate a DH exchange, which will allow both nodes
   to compute a shared secret (Ksm).  Note that the first LBU message
   sent by the MN to the MAP MUST be authenticated with Ks.

   The SMS option has the following format:


      0                   1                   2                   3

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document introduces 5 new types of options and one new type of
   message.  The values of these types are 8-bit unsigned integers.
   These values are allocated according to the Standards Actions or IESG
   approval policies defined in [IANA].

7.  Security Considerations

   This proposal suggests using the CBID and CGA technologies in order
   to avoid increasing the number of messages that need to be signed
   with an RSA key beyond the SEND procedure.  This is recommended due
   to the fact that public key signature is a computationally expensive
   and lengthy procedure.

   The suggested proposal does not create nor enhance any new and/or
   existing threats.  In particular, launching a man-in-the middle
   attack against the MN is not possible because the attacker is not
   aware of the shared secret Ks.  In addition, launching a denial of
   service (DoS) attack against the MAP or the MN is not easy due to the
   fact that both nodes can quickly scan incoming messages for a partial
   authenticity before processing the entire message.
