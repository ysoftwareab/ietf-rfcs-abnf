1.  Introduction

   The Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) [RFC5357] can be used
   to measure performance parameters of IP networks such as latency,
   jitter, and packet loss by sending test packets and monitoring their
   experience in the network.  The [RFC5357] defines two protocols,
   TWAMP Control and TWAMP Test, and a profile of TWAMP Test, TWAMP
   Light.  The TWAMP Light is known to have many implementations though
   no common management framework being defined, thus leaving some
   aspects of test packet processing to interpretation.  The goal of
   this document is to collect analyze these variations; describe common
   model while allowing for extensions in the future.  This document
   defines such a TWAMP data model and specifies it formally using the
   YANG data modeling language [RFC6020].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  Scope, Model, and Applicability

   The scope of this document includes model of the TWAMP Light as
   defined in Appendix I of [RFC5357] as well as model of accepted
   Errata.  The former mode of TWAMP Light will be referred in this
   document as Stateless and the latter - Stateful.  This document
   benefits from earlier attempt to define TWAMP MIB in
   [I-D.elteto-ippm-twamp-mib] and from TWAMP YANG model defined in
   [I-D.cmzrjp-ippm-twamp-yang].

   Figure 1 updates TWAMP-Light reference model presented in Appendix I
   [RFC5357] for the scenario when instantiation of a TWAMP-Test session
   between Session-Sender and Session-Reflector controlled by
   communication between a Configuration Client as a manager and
   Configuration Servers as agents of the configuration session.

3.  Data Model

   Creating TWAMP-Light data model presents number of challenges and
   among them is identification of a test-session at Session-Reflector.
   A Session-Reflector MAY require only as little as its IP and UDP port

   number in received TWAMP-Test packet to spawn new test session.  More
   so, to test processing of Class-of-Service along the same route in
   Equal Cost Multi-Path environment Session-Sender may run TWAMP test
   sessions concurrently using the same source IP address, source UDP
   port number, destination IP address, and destination UDP port number.
   Thus the only parameter that can be used to differentiate these test
   sessions would be DSCP value.  The DSCP field may get re-marked along
   the path and without use of [I-D.ietf-ippm-type-p-monitor] that will
   go undetected, but by using five-tuple instead of four-tuple as a key
   we can ensure that TWAMP test packets that are considered as
   differesnt test sessions follow the same path even in ECMP
   environments.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a URI in the IETF XML registry [RFC3688].
   Following the format in [RFC3688], the following registration is
   requested to be made.

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-twamp-light

   Registrant Contact: The IPPM WG of the IETF.

   XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers a YANG module in the YANG Module Names
   registry [RFC6020].

   name: ietf-twamp-light

   namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-twamp-light

   prefix: twamp

   reference: RFC XXXX

5.  Security Considerations

   The configuration, state, action data defined in this document may be
   accessed via the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241].  SSH [RFC6242] is
   mandatory secure transport that is the lowest NETCONF layer.  The
   NETCONF access control model [RFC6536] provides means to restrict
   access for particular NETCONF users to a pre-configured subset of all
   available NETCONF protocol operations and content.

   But, in general, this TWAMP Light YANG module does not change any
   underlying security issues that already may exhist in
   [I-D.elteto-ippm-twamp-mib].
