1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines as set of managed objects that support
   monitoring and configuration of Service Location Protocol Version 2
   (SLPv2) [RFC2608] [RFC3111] directory agents (DAs), service agents
   (SAs), and user agents (UAs).  
   
   The SLP MIB supports minimal passive monitoring of SLPv2 agents for
   network management purposes.  The SLP MIB also supports (optional)
   passive monitoring of SLPv2 DA and SLPv2 SA configured and discovered
   network addresses and agent attributes.  The SLP MIB also supports
   (optional) configuration of SLPv2 agent properties defined in
   [RFC2614].  
   
   This document is laid out as follows:  
   
   o   Section 2 briefly describes the SNMP network management
       framework.  
       
   o   Section 3 enumerates design requirements for the SLP MIB.  
       
   o   Section 4 provides an overview of the SLP MIB, including
       conformance terminology and SLP-specific terminology.  
       
   o   Section 5 specifies the SLP MIB in SMIv2 [RFC2578], including the
       conformance requirements for SNMP Command Responders that claim
       conformance to this document.  
       
   o   Sections 6, 7, and 8 specify IANA, internationalization, and
       security considerations.  
       
   o   Sections 9, 10, 11, and 12 list acknowledgements, references,
       authors' addresses, and full IETF copyright statement.  



2.  SNMP Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:
   
   o     An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].
   
   o     Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
         purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
         Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
         STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC

Bakke, McDonald             Expires 11 August 2002              [Page 3]

Internet Draft      Service Location Protocol MIB       11 February 2002

         1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described
         in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and
         STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].
   
   o     Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
         first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
         described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of
         the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
         track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
         [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the
         message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906
         [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].
   
   o     Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
         first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
         described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of
         protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
         RFC 1905 [RFC1905].
   
   o     A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
         [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
         in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].
   
   
   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].
   
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.
   
   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

3.  Design Requirements for SLP MIB

   The SLP MIB design requirements listed below are not conformance
   requirements on _implementations_ of the SLP MIB.  Therefore the
   words must, should, and may are used below in lowercase (informative
   per [RFC2119] conventions).  
   
   o   The SLP MIB must provide an SNMP interface to monitor and
       (optionally) configure SLPv2 [RFC2608] directory agents (DAs),
       service agents (SAs), and user agents (UAs).  
       
   o   The SLP MIB must be organized so that access can be controlled
       effectively by using the User-based Security Model [RFC2574] and 
       the View-based Access Control Model [RFC2575] from the SNMPv3
       framework.  
       
   o   The SLP MIB must not compromise native security in SLPv2
       [RFC2608] by exposing private keys or other confidential
       information via SNMP.  
       
   o   The SLP MIB must define a core set of mandatory object groups
       that support minimal passive monitoring requirements.  
       
   o   The SLP MIB should define additional an optional object group
       that supports configuration of the 'net.slp' properties defined
       in [RFC2614].  
       
   o   The SLP MIB must use UTF-8 [2279] for all human-readable text
       strings per [RFC2277] for internationalization support.

4.  Overview of SLP MIB

   The SLP MIB can be used to monitor and (optionally) configure SLPv2
   [RFC2608] directory agents (DAs), service agents (SAs), and user
   agents (UAs).  The SLP MIB makes no assumptions about the particular
   system topology of the managed SLP agents (for example, they may be
   distributed across several rack-mounted processors in a router).  
   
   
   
   4.1.  Conformance Terminology
   
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].  
   
   
   
   4.2.  SLP Terminology
   
   The SLP MIB uses the following definitions from SLPv2 [RFC2608]:  
   
   o   "User Agent (UA)" 
       A process working on the user's behalf to establish contact with
       some service.  The UA retrieves service information from the
       Service Agents or Directory Agents.  
       
   o   "Service Agent (SA)" 
       A process working on the behalf of one or more services to
       advertise the services.  
       
   o   "Directory Agent (DA)" 
       A process which collects service advertisements.  There can only
       be one DA present per given host.  
       
   o   "Scope" 
       A set of services, typically making up a logical administrative
       group.

   4.3.  Abstract Model of SLP MIB
   
   The Agent group is the principal object group in the abstract model
   defined in the SLP MIB.  
   
   The Scope, Address, and Attribute tables (all subordinate to
   "slpAgentTable") each use a high-order index of "slpAgentIndex" for
   linkage to the "slpAgentTable".  
   
   The following is a diagram of the abstract model of the SLP MIB.  
   
    (Mandatory)
   |===========|
   |   Agent   |  (One row per local DA, SA, or UA configured on system)
   |===========|
         |        INDEX { slpAgentIndex }
         |
         |
         |              (Mandatory)
         |        0..* |===========|
         |.............|   Scope   |  (One row per scope value)
         |             |===========|
         |                            INDEX { slpAgentIndex,
         |                                    slpScopeIndex }
         |
         |              (Optional)
         |        0..* |===========|
         |.............|  Address  |  (One row per remote DA/SA address)
         |             |===========|
         |                            INDEX { slpAgentIndex,
         |                                    slpAddressIndex }
         |
         |              (Optional)
         |        0..* |===========|
         |.............| Attribute |  (One row per DA/SA attribute)
                       |===========|
                                      INDEX { slpAgentIndex,
                                              slpAttributeIndex }
   
    (Optional)
   |===========|
   | Property  |  (Configuration scalars)
   |===========|  slpPropertyAgentIndex (target of configuration)
                  slpPropertyName (name of configuration property)
                  slpPropertyValue (value of configuration property)

   4.4.  Relationship to SNMP Architecture MIB (RFC 2571)
   
   The SLP MIB defines all text strings with a syntax of
   'SnmpAdminString' [RFC2571] which supports human-readable information
   in UTF-8 [RFC2279].  
   
   
   
   4.5.  Relationship to Host Resources MIB (RFC 2790)
   
   The SLP MIB supports specification of the SLP agent software for each
   SLP agent configured via a pointer to the 'hrSWInstalledTable' in the
   Host Resources MIB [RFC2790] in the following object:  
   
   o   "slpAgentSWInstalledIndexOrZero" - a value for
       "hrSWInstalledIndex" in the Host Resources MIB for this SLP
       agent's software

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA should assign a base arc in the 'mgmt' (standards track) OID
   tree for the 'slpMIB' MODULE-IDENTITY defined in the SLP MIB.  
   
   The following definitions in the SLP MIB depend on IANA
   registrations:  
   
   o   "slpAgentMessageTypesSupported" contains an array of the binary
       values assigned by SLPv2 [RFC2608] or assigned by IANA for the
       Function-ID in SLPv2 messages.  
       
   o   "slpAgentExtensionsSupported" contains an array of the binary
       values assigned by SLPv2 [RFC2608] or assigned by IANA for the
       Extension ID in SLPv2 messages.  
   
   There are no other IANA considerations associated with the SLP MIB.  



7.  Internationalization Considerations

   The SLPv2 protocol [RFC2608] transfers all text strings in UTF-8
   [RFC2279].  
   
   The SLP MIB defines all text strings with a syntax of
   'SnmpAdminString' [RFC2571] which supports human-readable information
   in UTF-8 [RFC2279].  The SLP MIB is therefore in full conformance
   with the best practices in "IETF Policy on Character Sets and
   Languages" [RFC2277].  



8.  Security Considerations

   There are a few management objects defined in this MIB that have a
   MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The support
   for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.  
   
   In particular, this MIB defines the following read-write objects:  
   
   o   "slpPropertyAgentIndex" - an integer to specify the target row in
       the 'slpAgentTable' for configuration of an SLPv2 agent 
       
   o   "slpPropertyName" - a string to specify the name of an SLPv2
       property defined in [RFC2614] or an implementation private
       property for configuration of that SLPv2 property on a given

       SLPv2 agent 
       
   o   "slpPropertyValue" - a string to specify the value of an SLPv2
       property defined in [RFC2614] or an implementation private
       property for configuration of that SLPv2 property on a given
       SLPv2 agent 
   
   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
   sensitive information.  These include:  
   
   o   "slpScopeSource" - a configuration source for an SLPv2 set of
       services (typically an administrative group) 
       
   o   "slpScopeValue" - a string scope value for an SLPv2 set of
       services (typically an administrative group) 
       
   o   "slpAddressSource" - a configuration source for an SLPv2 remote
       directory agent (DA) or service agent (SA) address 
       
   o   "slpAddressOrName" - a string IPv4 address, IPv6 address, or DNS 
       name for an SLPv2 remote DA or SA address 
   
   These four objects reveal potentially sensitive information about the
   existence and identification of SLPv2 infrastructure.  
   
   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and 
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them
   over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features
   for such a secure environment.  
   
   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.  
   
   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use 
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-
   based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.  
   
   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.

13.  Appendix I - Issues

   [to be deleted before publication as an RFC] 
   
   ISSUE 02-1 - Should the SLPv2 API [RFC2614] be made 'standards track'
   or should the Property group (configuration) be deleted from SLP MIB?
   
   ISSUE 01-1 - Should the SLP MIB be extended with optional groups for 
   Services (advertised by an SA or DA) and their Service Attributes?  
   Resolution - No - minimal instrumentation in draft-02.  
   
   ISSUE 01-2 - Should the 'SlpMessageTypeTC' textual convention be
   changed to a simple 'Integer32 (1.255)' rather than an enumeration to
   avoid the need for a future IANA-maintained SLP-Types MIB?  
   Resolution - No - replace with binary values from SLPv2 [RFC2608].  
   
   ISSUE 00-1 - Should the SLP MIB integrate with SNMPv3 USM MIB
   [RFC2574] for SLPv2 Security Parameter Index (SPI) configuration?  
   Resolution - No - revised SLPv2 will use IPSec-based security.  
   
   ISSUE 00-2 - Which object groups in the SLP MIB should be mandatory?
   Resolution - only Agent and Scope groups.  
   
   ISSUE 00-3 - Should the Alert (trap) group be mandatory?  
   Resolution - No - Alert group deleted in draft-02.  



14.  Appendix X - Change Log

   [to be deleted before publication as an RFC] 
   
   <draft-mcdonald-svrloc-mib-02.txt> 11 February 2002 
   - major rewrite to reduce complexity, per request of Bert Wijnen 
   - simplified indexing in Scope, Address, and Attribute groups 
   - changed MAX-ACCESS of all columnar objects from 'read-create' to
   'read-only' (for required Monitoring) 
   - deleted all 'RowStatus' objects (no longer needed) 
   - added Property group with 'read-write' scalar objects (for optional
   Configuration) based on SLPv2 API [RFC2614] 
   - deleted Admin, Timer, Network, Interface, Counter, and Trace groups
   - deleted Alert notification group 
   
   <draft-mcdonald-svrloc-mib-01.txt> 20 November 2001 
   - removed sub-typing of objects in SEQUENCE clauses, per 'smilint'
   and section 7.1.12 'Conceptual Tables' of SMIv2 [RFC 2578] 
   - renamed all textual conventions, suffixing 'TC' to avoid names
   which differ only by case, per 'smilint' warning
