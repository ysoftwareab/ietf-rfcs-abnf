                       Nested Compression in ROHC
              draft-wei-tsvwg-nested-header-compression-00

Abstract

   The appearance of wireless technologies in cellular network attracts
   the attentions to compress at least two layers of nested compression
   headers.  This document describes a nested compression scenario, by
   coordinating the header fields that have similar functions or even
   are repeated in layers of nested compressed packet, to reduce
   processing latency, packet header payload and increase the
   compression efficiency.

1.  Introduction

   In cellular communication system, compression technology is
   extensively used.  The application of compression technology can
   significantly reduce the use of radio resource and improve the
   network transmission delay.  ROHC technologies are effective way to
   improve system performance in wireless communication system.  The
   Robust Header Compression (ROHC) protocol provides an efficient,
   flexible, and future-proof header compression concept.  It is
   designed to operate efficiently and robustly over various link
   technologies with different characteristics.  The development of
   wireless communication technologies leads the nesting header
   compression to be an appreciate requirement.  This document is
   structured as follows: First, we start by describing the terminology
   and acronyms used in this document in Section 2, Followed by the
   requirements and applicability of the nested compression method
   proposed in this document in Section 3, and then the concept and
   behavior introduction of compressor and decompression in Section 4.
   In Section 5 we discuss nested compression scheme in detail.  Final
   discussions are CRC Considerations, security considerations, IANA
   considerations, and Acknowledgements.

3.  Requirements and Applicability

3.1.  Requirements

   Modern wireless technologies increase the density of sites and
   antennas by adding some new intermediate nodes based on the original
   site.  It is the wireless link between these additional intermediate
   note and the original base station (eNB).  The data of downlink
   reaches base station first and passes through Relay node, and then is
   transferred to the user equipment by Relay node, upstream is the
   opposite direction.  This approach can improve the quality of the
   terminal link, therefore enhance the system spectrum efficiency and
   user data rate.  As shown below, intermediate node is between base
   station and mobile terminal.

   Picture 2 possible protocol stack

   When data is transferred in a single hop link, it just need header
   fields of link-layer to guarantee packet be correctly transmitted to
   next hop.  However, header fields in the network layer or above such
   as IP, UDP, RTP does not work in a single hop, so ROHC in the OSI /
   ISO protocol stack located between the link layer and network layer,
   i.e.  PDCP layer.

   There is one ROHC header (IP/UDP/RTP compression header) in
   encapsulation date without intermediate node:

   Picture 4 encapsulation date with nested compression

   In the case of nested compression, the existing technology will only
   use a specific compression method such as IP / UDP / RTP compression
   profile or IP / UDP / TUNNEL-PROTOCOL compression profile
   respectively to compress each protocol header in nested layers.
   There is no connection between the compression headers.  Header
   fields that have similar functions or even are repeated in layers of
   nested compression occupy bytes, resulting in vital waste of radio
   resources.

3.2.  Applicability

   In this document, nested compression program applies to any scenarios
   with nested ROHC header compression.


4.  Compressor and decompressor

   ROHC is primarily designed to compress the packet stream.  Its
   function entities include the compressor and decompressor.  When a
   new packet stream arrives, the compressor comes into the
   initialization compression state, the header field information of
   stream packet is stored in the corresponding context.  At the some
   time, the complete context information is sent to the decompressor.
   When the compressor detects the receipt of context information at
   decompressor, compressor will enter the compressed state and start to
   send compressed packets.  After that, every time at sending a packet,
   context information of the packet stream should be updated.
   Accordingly, the decompressor save complete context information send
   by compressor at first, after that, every time at receiving a packet,
   the decompressor should update the corresponding context information
   to ensure the preservation is the last context information , so as to
   make sure the synchronization between the compressor and
   decompression.  In this process, when there is error caused by
   wireless link, packet loss and other reasons, context information
   between decompressor and the compressor may be inconsistencies, which
   cause failure of decompression.  CRC arithmetic in ROHC can make sure
   the context information updated timely and correctly.

4.1.  Compressor

   At the compressor side, ROHC is responsible for handling packet that
   the network layer submitted to the link layer.  In the network layer,
   each network interface can initiate a number of packet streams.  In
   the ROHC protocol, context information is conceptually kept in a
   table.  The context table is indexed using the CID, which is sent
   along with compressed headers and feedback information.  Packet

   processed by ROHC compressor, removing the long header fields such as
   IP header field, UDP header field and the RTP header field of the
   packet submitted by network-layer, while, it add a much shorter
   length of the ROHC header field in front of the data, and submit it
   to the link layer for packet encapsulation, and sent to the next node
   by way of point to point at the network layer.

4.2.  Decompressor

   At the decompressor side, ROHC is responsible for handling packet
   that the link layer submitted to the network layer.  When receives
   packet of link-layer, the decompressor distinguish different packet
   streams via each other's network interface and the CID .Then
   decompressor find context information of the packet stream according
   to the new ROHC header field, and recovered the original packet,
   including the IP header field, UDP and RTP header field header fields
   and so on, and then decompressor re-submit the decompression packet
   to the network layer.


5.  Nested compression

5.1.  overview

   This document describes a nested compression schemes: In the case
   that need nested compression, coordinating the header fields that
   have similar functions or even are repeated in layers of nested
   compression , that is, borrow, and delete some redundant fields (MSN
   or LSB).  At the nested compression process, some header fields in
   inner compression packet and outer compressed packet can be be used
   by each other.

   The process is as follows: the compressor sends data packets to the
   intermediate node, which includes the inner compression header.  When
   intermediate node receives the packet headers, it adds the outer
   compression headers, and then removes the duplicate field by
   coordinating the header fields that have similar functions or even
   are repeated in layers of nested compression.  After that
   intermediate station sends nested header compression protocol packets
   to the decompressor.

5.2.  Nested compression

   Nested compression method in this document can be applied to any case
   that exist the nested compression.  In the picture below, UE is
   compressor, the intermediate station is Decompressor/Compressor , eNB
   is Decompressor.  There are at least two layers of nested protocol
   header in the intermediate station, inside is IP / UDP / RTP

   CID:CID index the context table.  The CID space can be either small,
   which means that CIDs can take the values 0 through 15, or large,
   which means that CIDs take values between 0 and 2^14 - 1 = 16383.
   Whether the CID space is large or small MUST be established, possibly
   by negotiation, before any compressed packet may be sent over the
   ROHC channel.

   Profile: A ROHC profile defines the elements that build up the
   compression protocol.

   CRC: The CRC verification refers to the verification of the result of
   a decompression attempt using the 3-bit CRC or 7-bit CRC included in
   the header of a compressed packet format.

   MSN: Compression of header fields is based on the establishment of a
   function to a sequence number, called the master sequence
   number(MSN).

   LSB: Least Significant Bit. A profile is identified by a 16-bit
   value, where the 8 LSB bits indicate the actual profile, and the 8
   MSB bits indicate the variant of that profile.

   After adding the outer layer of protocol packet (IP / UDP / TUNNEL-
   PROTOCOL) at the intermediate node, we can make nested compression .A
   part of the functional information (eg, Sequence number, CRC check)
   of the inner ROHC header field(IP/UDP/RTP ) can be used by the outer
   ROHC header field(IP/UDP/TUNNEL-PROTOCOL).

   The inner ROHC header field(IP/UDP/RTP ) and the outer ROHC header

   table 3 outer ROHC header field(IP/UDP/TUNNEL-PROTOCOL)

   In the outer nested compression IP / UDP / TUNNEL-PROTOCOL header,
   CRC field is necessary to integrate the CRC field of compression IP /
   UDP / RTP protocol header and re-calculate; MSN field can be directly
   copied from the MSN field of the inner nested compression IP / UDP /
   RTP header.  At the same time, in order to reduce the repeat field
   inner and outer of the nested compression, we can remove the CRC and
   MSN field of the inner ROHC packet to improve the compression
   efficiency, saving transmission radio resources.


6.  CRC Considerations

6.1.  CRC in compressed headers

   The CRC in compressed headers is calculated over all octets of the
   entire original header, before compression, in the following
   manner[RFC3095].

   The octets of the header are classified as either CRC-STATIC or CRC-
   DYNAMIC, and the CRC is calculated over:

Internet-Draft             Nested compression                  June 2010


   1.  the concatenated CRC-STATIC octets of the original header, placed
       in the same order as they appear in the original header, followed
       by
   2.  the concatenated CRC-DYNAMIC octets of the original header,
       placed in the same order as they appear in the original header.

   The intention is that the state of the CRC computation after 1) will
   be saved.  As long as the CRC-STATIC octets do not change, the CRC
   calculation will then only need to process the CRC-DYNAMIC octets.

   In a typical RTP/UDP/IPv4 header, 25 octets are CRC-STATIC and 15 are
   CRC-DYNAMIC.  In a typical RTP/UDP/IPv6 header, 49 octets are CRC-
   STATIC and 11 are CRC-DYNAMIC.  This technique will thus reduce the
   computational complexity of the CRC calculation by roughly 60% for
   RTP/UDP/IPv4 and by roughly 80% for RTP/UDP/IPv6.

   Note: Whenever the CRC-STATIC fields change, the new saved CRC state
   after 1) is compared with the old state.  If the states are
   identical, the CRC cannot catch the error consisting in the
   decompressor not having updated the static context.  In U/O-mode the
   compressor SHOULD then for a while use packet types with another CRC
   length, for which there is a difference in CRC state, to ensure error
   detection.

   The initial content of the CRC register is preset to all 1's.

   The polynomial to be used for the 3 bit CRC is:

   C(x) = 1 + x + x^3

   The polynomial to be used for the 7 bit CRC is:

   C(x) = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^6 + x^7

   The CRC in compressed headers is calculated over the entire original
   header, before compression.

6.2.  Discussion of CRC problem in nested compression

   Here, there are two cases of nested compression in the scenario: one
   is that the data packet is transmitted from the sender to the
   intermediate node, but the intermediate node dose not decompress the
   packet.  The intermediate node makes nested compression with the
   whole nested packet header after add the outer packet header, and
   then forwards it directly to the receiver.  Another is that the data
   packet is transmitted from the sender to the intermediate node,and
   the intermediate node decompress the packets received.  The
   intermediate node compresses the inner and outer of nested packet

   respectively, then forwards it to the receiver .

   The first case: as the intermediate node does not decompresses the
   packet sent by the sender, i.e. it carries out CRC only at the
   receiver but not at the intermediate node, if a CRC check fails, the
   receiver can not determines where error has occurred , at the
   transmission link between sender and intermediate node or between
   intermediate node and receiver.  In this case, the receiver has to
   send NACK to the sender and request the retransmission of packet.

   The second case: the intermediate node carries out CRC when
   decompresses the packet sent by the sender. if a CRC check fails, it
   can determines that error has occurred at the transmission link
   between sender and intermediate node, then intermediate node returns
   the NACK to the sender for packet retransmission.  If a CRC check
   does not fails at intermediate node , but a CRC check fails at the
   receiver, it can be judged that error has occurred at the
   transmission link between intermediate node and receiver, then
   receiver return the NACK to intermediate node to request packet
   retransmission.
