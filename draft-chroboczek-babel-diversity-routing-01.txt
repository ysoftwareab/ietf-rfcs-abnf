            Diversity Routing for the Babel Routing Protocol
              draft-chroboczek-babel-diversity-routing-01

Abstract

   This document defines an extension to the Babel routing protocol that
   allows routing updates to carry radio frequency information, and
   therefore makes it possible to use radio diversity information for

1.  Introduction and background

   The Babel routing protocol [RFC6126] does not mandate a specific
   algorithm for computing metrics; Appendix A of that document suggests
   using an additive integer metric.  While this works well in many
   topologies, it fails to take into account the possibility of
   interference between radio links, which is important in multi-
   frequency wireless mesh networks.

   Consider for example the following topology, where the solid lines
   use one radio frequency and the dashed lines another, and suppose
   that the solid frequency has very slightly lower packet loss than the
   dashed one:

      B
     / \
    /   \
   A     D
    \   .
     \ .
      C

   When sending data from A to D, Babel will reliably choose the solid
   route through B.  Howerver, this route self-interferes: when B is
   sending a packet to D, it cannot simultaneously be receiving a packet
   from A, which halves the effective throughput.  No such issue arises
   with the route through C, which should therefore be preferred.

   Interference needs to be taken into account even when it happens
   between non-adjacent links.  Consider the following topology:

      B +++ C
     /       \
    /         \
   A           F
    \         .
     \       .
      D +++ E

   When routing data from A to F, the route through B and C has two
   interfering links: if two packets are sent by A and C at roughly the
   same time, a collision will occur, and both packets will need to be
   resent.  Again, no such issue arises with the route through D and E.

2.  Operation of the protocol

   The diversity protocol extension allows a Babel router to attach
   information about radio frequency to the routes that it maintains --
   we call this the route's "diversity information".

   We assume that all links can be categorised into one of the following
   categories:

   o  non-interfering links, e.g. wired links;

   o  links that have a well defined frequency, and only interfere with
      other links at the same frequency; these are described by a single
      channel number, an integer between 1 and 254;

   o  interfering links, links that interfere with all other links
      except non-interfering links.

   This model does not describe reality accurately, since distinct but
   close radio frequencies do in fact interfere, but it works well
   enough in practical networks, where a small number of discrete radio
   frequencies are used.

2.1.  Changes to data structures

   A Babel router maintains a route table ([RFC6126] Section 3.2.5).  A
   router implementing diversity routing has one additional field in
   every route table entry:

   o  the diversity data, a (possibly zero-length) sequence of channel
      numbers, each of which is an integer between 0 and 255.

Internet-Draft           Babel Diversity Routing           February 2016


   The diversity data is interpreted as the set of channels of the links
   that would be followed by a packet sent along this route, omitting
   non-interfering links.  The values 0 and 255 are special: they
   indicate, respectively, a non-interfering link (a link that doesn't
   interfere with any other links) and an interfering link (a link that
   is assumed to interfere with all other links except non-interfering
   ones).

2.2.  Receiving updates

   When a node receives an Update TLV, it creates or updates a routing
   table entry according to [RFC6126], Section 3.5.4.  A node that
   performs diversity routing extends the procedure given in that
   section with the following actions.

   Let D be the diversity information attached to the received Update
   TLV, or the one-element sequence 255 if there is no such information.
   Then the diversity information in the routing table entry is set to
   D', where:

   o  if the interface over which the update was received is non-
      interfering, then either D'=0.D or D'=D (the choice is left to the
      implementation);

   o  if the interface over which the update was received is
      interfering, then D'=255.D;

   o  if the interface over which the update was received is tuned to
      channel C, then D'=C.D.

   Note that zero-length diversity information is different from lack of
   diversity information: the latter is treated as 255 (interfering,
   since no information is available) in order to ensure reasonable
   behaviour when interoperating with the original Babel protocol.

   Note further that there are two ways of encoding a non-interfering
   link: the interference information can be omitted (D'=D) or a 0 can
   be prepended to the interference information.  The latter, less
   parsimonious encoding MAY be preferred by implementations that wish
   to ignore diversity information after a given number of hops.  Both
   encodings MUST be correctly parsed by a receiving node.

2.3.  Sending updates

   A Babel node sends updates in various circumstances, described in
   [RFC6126], Section 3.7.  A node performing diversity routing attaches
   diversity data to every update that it send.  This diversity data is
   computed as follows:

Internet-Draft           Babel Diversity Routing           February 2016


   o  if the update is for a locally redistributed route, then the value
      is implementation-dependent (zero-length diversity information is
      a good choice in most cases);

   o  if the update is for a route in the Babel route table, then the
      diversity information is taken from the route table.

2.4.  Metric computation and route selection

   How the diversity data is used for metric computation and/or route
   selection is left to the implementation, as long as it obeys the
   rules given in Sections 3.5.2 and 3.6 of [RFC6126].  In particular,
   the strict monotonicity requirement implies that a non-interfering
   hop must be taken into account in the resulting metric -- it cannot
   be simply ignored.

   An algorithm that has been found to work well in practice is given in
   Appendix A.

2.5.  Protocol encoding

   We define one new sub-TLV which is attached to Update TLVs and
   contains a sequence of channel numbers.

2.5.1.  Encoding of channel numbers

   A channel number is encoded as a one-octet integer.  The values MUST
   be interpreted as follows:

   o  0: used to represent a non-interfering link;

   o  1-254: radio channel numbers, link-technology specific

   o  255: used to represent an interfering link.

   In order to ensure consistent metrics computation, implementations
   supporting IEEE 802.11 SHOULD use values 1 through 14 and 46 through
   165 for encoding IEEE 802.11b and IEEE 802.11a channel numbers
   respectively, and implementations using other link technologies
   SHOULD choose values that do not collide with IEEE 802.11a/b channel
   numbers.  However, since choosing inconsistent values does not
   prevent interoperability but merely leads to suboptimal routing, this
   is not mandated by this specification.

2.5.2.  The Diversity sub-TLV

   Diversity data is carried in a Diversity sub-TLV [RFC7557] that is
   carried by Update TLVs.  The sub-TLV contains a sequence of octets
   that directly encode the diversity data from the route table.

   0                   1                   2                   3
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |    Type = 2   |    Length     |   Channel 1   |   Channel 2   |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   Channel 3   |  ...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

   Fields :

   Type      Set to 2 to indicate a Diversity Information sub-TLV.

   Length    The length of the body, exclusive of the Type and Length
             fields.

   Channel n An integer between 0 and 255, as described in the previous
             section.

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is instructed to add the following entry to the "Babel Sub-TLV
   Types" registry:

                  +------+-----------+-----------------+
                  | Type | Name      | Reference       |
                  +------+-----------+-----------------+
                  | 2    | Diversity | (this document) |
                  +------+-----------+-----------------+

Appendix A.  The Z3 algorithm

   In this section, we describe the Z3 algorithm, a particular instance
   of diversity routing that has seen some modest deployment and that
   appears to work reasonably well in practice while being extremely
   easy to implement.

   The Z3 algorithm works by announcing a slightly smaller metric than
   the metric it uses for route selection when announcing over a non-
   interfering link.  In effect, a Z3 router maintains two metrics for
   each route: the noninterfering metric, which is announced on links
   that can be proven to not interfere with the route being announced,
   and the interfering metric, which is used for route selection and
   announced over all other links.

   More precisely, upon receiving an update with metric M over a link
   with cost C, the interfering metric is set to C+M, as suggested in
   Appendix A of [RFC6126].  The non-interfering metric is set to
   alpha*C+M, where 0<alpha<1 is called the diversity factor (with
   rounding biased upwards in order to ensure strict monotonicity).

   Let D be the diversity data of route R, and L be a link.  We say that
   R interferes with L when one of the following is true:

   o  L is a non-interfering link (e.g. an Ethernet); or

   o  L is a radio interface tuned to channel C, and neither C nor 255
      is an element of D.

   When we announce R over L, we announce the interfering metric if R
   interferes with L, and the non-interfering metric otherwise.

   The metric that Z3 yields is non-isotonic; hence, Z3 Babel does not
   necessarily converge to a set of minimum-metric routes.  In fact, the
   set of minimum-metric routes might not even be a tree in the general
   case.  We believe that Z3 Babel converges to a Nash equilibrium, but
   this appears to be a difficult property to prove.
