            Removing DS records from parent via CDS/CDNSKEY
                     draft-ogud-dnsop-ds-remove-00

Abstract

   RFC7344 specifies how trust can be maintained in-band between parent
   and child.  There are two features missing in that specification:
   initial trust setup and removal of trust anchor.  This document
   addresses the second omission.

   There are many reasons why a domain may want to go unsigned.  Some of
   them are related to DNS operator changes, others are related to
   DNSSEC signing system changes.  The inability to turn off DNSSEC via
   in-band signalling is seen as a liability in some circles.  This
   document addresses the issue in a sane way.

1.  Introduction

   CDS/CDNSKEY [RFC7344] records are used to signal changes in trust
   anchors, this is a great way to maintain delegations when the DNS
   operator has no other way to notify parent that changes are needed.
   The original versions of the draft that became RFC7344 contained a
   "delete" signal, the DNSOP working group at the time did not want
   that feature, thus it was removed.

   This document re-introduces the delete option for both CDS and
   CDNSKEY.  The reason is simply that it is necessary to be able to
   turn off DNSSEC.  The main reason has to do with when a domain is
   moved from one DNS operator to another one.  Common scenarios
   include:

   (I)     moving from a DNSSEC operator to a non-DNSSEC capable one

   (II)    moving to one that cannot/does-not-want to do a proper DNSSEC
           rollover

   (III)   user does not want DNSSEC

   Whatever the reason, the lack of a "remove my DS" option is turning
   into the latest excuse as why DNSSEC cannot be deployed.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  DNSSEC Delete Algorithm

   The DNSKEY algorithm registry contains two reserved values: 0 and
   255[RFC4034].  The CERT record [RFC4398] defines the value 0 to mean
   the algorithm in the CERT record is not defined in DNSSEC.
   For this reason, using the value 0 in CDS/CDNSKEY delete operations
   is potentially problematic, but we propose that here anyway as the
   risk is minimal.  The alternative is to reserve one DNSSEC algorithm
   number for this purpose.

   Right now, no DNSSEC validator understands algorithm 0 as a valid
   signature algorithm, thus if the validator sees a DNSKEY or DS record
   with this value, it will treat it as unknown.  Accordingly, the zone
   is treated as unsigned unless there are other algorithms present.

   In the context of CDS and CDNSKEY records, DNSSEC algorithm 0 is
   defined and means delete the DS set.  The contents of the records
   MUST contain only the fixed fields as show below.

   (I)    CDS 0 0 0

   (II)   CDNSKEY 0 3 0

   The there is no keying information in the records, just the command
   to delete all DS records.  This record is signed in the same way as
   CDS/CDNSKEY is signed.

   Once the parent has verified the CDS/CDNSKEY record and it has passed
   other acceptance tests, the DS record MUST be removed.  At this point
   the child can start the process of turning DNSSEC off.

3.  Security considerations

   This document is about avoiding validation failures when a domain
   moves from one DNS operator to another one.  In most cases it is
   preferable that operators collaborate on the rollover by doing a
   KSK+ZSK rollover as part of the handoff, but that is not always
   possible.  This document addresses the case where unsigned state is
   needed.

   This document does not introduce any new problems, but like Negative
   Trust Anchor[I-D.ietf-dnsop-negative-trust-anchors], it addresses
   operational reality.

4.  IANA considerations

   This document updates the following IANA registries: "DNS Security
   Algorithm Numbers"

   Algorithm 0 adds a reference to this document.
