Abstract

   Interoperation of Instant Messaging and Presence systems has been
   defined in IMPP Working Group.  IMPP WG has come up with baseline
   interoperable operations and formats for Presence and Instant
   Messaging systems.  However, these base formats might need
   standardized extensions in order to enable building rational
   applications using Presence and Instant Messaging.  This memo
   proposes an extension to PIDF presence document format to be used in
   SIMPLE based Presence systems [1] but may also be applied to other
   protocols as well.

Internet-Draft    SIMPLE PIDF presence capabilities extension  October 2002


1. Introduction

   Interoperation of Instant Messaging and Presence systems has been
   defined in IMPP Working Group.  Working Group has defined a generic
   model for Presence and Instant Messaging [2] and also requirements
   for protocols implementing such a system [3].  Common Presence and
   Instant Messaging (CPIM) defines common operations and formats which
   all Presence and Instant Messaging services must agree upon so that
   basic interoperability would be possible [5].  The actual base format
   for presence is being defined in [4].  The PIDF document format has
   been designed to reduce the need for gatewaying and to allow end-to-
   end security of presence data.  It has taken very minimalistic
   approach to support such operations.  In order to make the PIDF
   format usable by different presence applications, these applications
   usually must extend the basic PIDF format by standard XML mechanism
   as defined in [4].

   The aim of this memo is to introduce SIP/SIMPLE specific extension
   mechanism for the PIDF document.  With this extension SIMPLE based
   applications can have richer and usable formats compared to the
   baseline PIDF data format.  Authors of this document believe that
   following items should be included into this extension:

   o  Support for SIP Caller Preferences and Callee Capabilities [7]

   Requirements for this extension are stated in [8] and Section 5
   explains how these requirements are fulfilled.

1.1 Motivation

   The PIDF document format [4] defines a <contact> element which may
   appear once inside every <tuple> element.  The content of the
   <contact>  element encodes the CONTACT ADDRESS and CONTACT MEANS as
   defined in [2].  The <contact> element is defined to be an URI.  This
   URI can be of any URI type.  In some implementations this URI can
   uniquely identify the application the tuple intends to describe (e.g.
   im: URIs).  However, this may not be the case in all implementations.
   For example in SIP, a SIP URI can represent different kinds of
   applications.  A SIP URI can be used to contact voice applications,
   video applications, or messaging applications.  If it is not known by
   other means, it might be hard for applications processing the
   presence document containing only SIP URI contact addresses to know
   what particular application the tuple intends to describe.  Also
   watchers receiving presence information would probably benefit for
   getting more descriptive information about what particular
   communication means or applications are supported by the presentity.

   Caller Preferences and Callee Capabilities document [7] defines a set



Lonnfors & Kiss          Expires April 25, 2003                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft    SIMPLE PIDF presence capabilities extension  October 2002


   of extensions which allow callers and callees to express preferences
   about request handling in SIP servers.  The same information could
   provide value also to presence watchers so that they could make more
   rational decisions on how presentity should be contacted if presence
   document would contain similar information as defined in  Caller
   Preferences and Callee Capabilities extension.  When the  Caller
   Preferences and Callee Capabilities extension is used in this context
   (to represent presence information) there is no need for automated
   processing compared to the case when the  Caller Preferences and
   Callee Capabilities extension is used by proxies or registrars.
   Because of this, it should be sufficient to introduce  Caller
   Preferences and Callee Capabilities extension representation for
   presence without specifying similar processing rules as defined in
   [7].

1.2 Scope

   This document defines  extension to the PIDF document format which
   enables presence implementations based on SIP protocol to utilize
   similar capabilities in presence document as what Caller Preferences
   and Callee Capabilities document [7] defines.  The intension is only
   to allow representation of callee capabilities and not caller
   preferences.

   This extension does not replace media negotiation mechanisms defined
   for SIP (e.g.  SDP [11]), therefore media negotiation (e.g.  choose
   of voice and video codecs) MUST be performed according to [9].  This
   extension is only aimed to give the watchers hints about the
   presentity's preferences, willingness and capabilities to communicate
   before watchers would initiate SIP based communication with the
   presentity.

2. Conventions

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [6] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.

3. Support for  Caller Preferences and Callee Capabilities

   This section presents  Caller Preferences and Callee Capabilities
   extension namespace, its elements, their values, and semantics.  This
   section also describes how this extension can be further extended.
   This extension is intended to be used with application/cpim-pidf+xml
   content type and that particular usage is described here.  This
   extension may also be used with other content types if appropriate.

Internet-Draft    SIMPLE PIDF presence capabilities extension  October 2002


3.1 Extension overview

   This extension adds most of the features presented in  Caller
   Preferences and Callee Capabilities document [7] into PIDF presence
   document format.  Features presented in [7] are added here without
   any change in their semantics.  Bringing these features to PIDF
   presence document format basically means mapping them to XML
   structure.  However, some  Caller Preferences and Callee Capabilities
   features are not needed here because identical counterpart already
   exists in PIDF.  These features are discussed in Section 3.6.

   When this extension namespace is congregated with base PIDF document,
   combined document must follow the same general formatting rules as
   specified in [4] in chapter 4.1.

3.2 Handing of  Caller Preferences and Callee Capabilities matching
    rules

   Caller Preferences and Callee Capabilities document [7] defines a set
   of matching rules which can be used to determine if capabilities
   represented by two different URLs are equal.  This extension is not
   aimed to provide these features i.e.  this document does not provide
   means to compare two presence documents to determine whether
   capabilities represented by those documents match.

3.3 <prescaps> element

   Root element of this extension namespace is <prescaps>.  The root
   element MUST be always present.  This element MAY contain one or more
   <feature> elements as specified later in this document.

   <prescaps> element does not have any attributes and it MAY contain
   other namespace declarations for the extensions used in the presence
   XML document.

3.4 <feature> element

   The <feature> element can represent any feature tag as defined in
   Caller Preferences and Callee Capabilities [7] or any media feature
   tag registered through [14].  This element MAY appear under
   <prescaps> element one or several times.  <feature> element has one
   mandatory attribute called name.  This attribute represents the name
   of the feature tag.  Each media feature tag (e.g.  media, feature and
   etc.) SHOULD appear only once inside root element.  If media feature
   tag has multiple values these values SHOULD be nested inside single
   <feature> element.  The <feature> cannot be extended using other
   namespace declarations.

Internet-Draft    SIMPLE PIDF presence capabilities extension  October 2002


3.5 <value> element

   The <value> element represents the value of media feature tag.  Each
   value element SHOULD contain only a single tag value.  It <feature>
   contains multiple values then all these values should be presented in
   different <value> elements.  The <value> element has optional
   attribute called negated.  This attribute is of boolean type.  It can
   be used to indicate whether feature value is supported or not
   supported.  Value 'true' indicates that value is not supported and
   value 'false' indicates that value is supported.  Default value is
   'false'.  <value> element cannot be extended using other namespace
   declarations.

3.6 Handling of  Caller Preferences and Callee Capabilities priority
    feature tag

   PIDF document format allows priority attribute to be used within
   <contact> element.  Caller Preferences and Callee Capabilities
   priority feature tag can be mapped into this attribute and so there
   is no need to represent priority feature tag in inside XML structure.

4. Guidelines for using extension with PIDF document format

   This section presents guidelines how extension can be used with PIDF
   document format.

   PIDF format allows use of extension XML namespaces inside <presence>,
   <tuple>, and <status> elements.  <presence> element is intended to
   describe presentity as a whole.  This extension is related to Contact
   Address to which this extension is applied to.  These Contact
   Addresses can only appear inside <tuple> elements.  The use of this
   extension in <presence> element level is NOT RECOMMENDED for this
   purpose.

   It is up to the applications using this extension to decide if they
   want to include extension inside <tuple> or inside <status> element.
   The semantics of the extension remains same regardless where it is
   placed inside PIDF document format.  Root element <prescaps> MUST NOT
   appear more than once inside a single <tuple> element but can appear
   multiple times in PIDF document format inside different <tuple>
   elements.

5. Fulfilling the requirements

   This section describes how the requirements presented in [8] are
   fulfilled.

Internet-Draft    SIMPLE PIDF presence capabilities extension  October 2002


5.1 Requirement 1 (Use PIDF Without Change)

   This document uses standard extension mechanism defined in [4] and
   does not require any changes to PIDF document format.

5.2 Requirement 2 (Represent a Tag-Set)

   This extension enables representation of tag sets using new XML
   namespace as defined in Section 7.

5.3 Requirement 3 (Represent Any Tag Set)

   This extension allows use of any Media feature tags as defined in
   Section 7.

5.4 Requirement 4 (Compatibility with Registration)

   Extension allows representation of all Contact parameters defined in
   [9] as feature elements and also representation of any extension
   parameters defined in [7].  Compatibility with registration can be
   achieved using following rules:

   o  Contact address is mapped to PIDF <contact> element without any
      parameters

   o  All Contact attributes are mapped into XML using PIDF elements
      (priority) and this extension elements.


6. Examples

   This section presents various examples how this extension can be used
   with base PIDF document format.

9. Security Considerations

   All security considerations specified in CPIM [5] and in PIDF [4]
   documents apply also to this document.  For clarity some of the
   things are repeated here.

   Because presence is very privacy-sensitive information, the transport
   protocol for the presence information SHOULD have capabilities to
   protect protocol messages from possible threats, such as
   eavesdropping, corruption, tamper and replay attacks.  The protocols
   SHOULD be able to use security mechanisms which are standardized or
   being standardized in IETF.  However, it depends on the actual
   transport protocols which security mechanisms should be used, and it
   is beyond the scope of this memo.
