Abstract

   This document specifies that a portion of the DHCP for IPv6 [DHCPv6]
   16-bit option space is reserved for site-specific options. Site-
   specific options are to be used for site specific needs and MUST NOT
   be used for public (IANA assigned) or vendor specific options.


1. Introduction

   The DHCP for IPv6 base specification [DHCPv6] did not reserve a
   range of option numbers for private use within sites, as was defined
   for DHCP for IPv4 [RFC2132].

   This document specifies that a portion of the DHCP for IPv6 16-bit
   option space is reserved for site-specific options. Site-specific
   options are to be used for site specific needs and MUST NOT be used
   for public (IANA assigned) or vendor specific options.

Internet Draft  Site Specific Options for DHCP for IPv6   25 March, 2003


2. Requirements

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3. Site-Specific Options

   The DHCP for IPv6 option codes from 65,280 to 65,534 are to be
   reserved for use by site-specific options. This reserves 254 option
   values for site-specific use.

   This range of option codes MUST NOT be assigned by IANA to any public
   options.

   This document does not define the behavior of clients, servers, and
   relay agents with respect to site-specific options, as these are
   site issues. However, it is recommended that client implementations:

   a. allow the list of site-specific options to be included in an
      Option Request Option (DHCPv6) to be configured,

   b. allow the list of site-specific options and the corresponding
      values to be sent in client request messages to be configured, and

   c. allow application software to obtain the data returned for site-
      specific options.


4. IANA Recommendations

   IANA is requested to reserve the DHCP for IPv6 options from 65,280
   to 65,534 (decimal), inclusive, for site-specific options. IANA will
   not manage these options; sites will manage this space.


5. Security Considerations

   This document in and by itself provides no security, nor does it
   impact existing security.
