      Generic YANG Data Model for Connection Oriented Operations,
             Administration, and Maintenance(OAM) protocols
                   draft-ietf-lime-yang-oam-model-10

Abstract

   This document presents a base YANG Data model for connection oriented
   OAM protocols.  It provides a technology-independent abstraction of
   key OAM constructs for such protocols.  The model presented here can
   be extended to include technology specific details.  This guarantees
   uniformity in the management of OAM protocols and provides support
   for nested OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at different
   levels through a unified interface)

Internet-Draft     Connection-Oriented OAM YANG model         April 2017


1.  Introduction

   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) are important
   networking functions that allow operators to:

   1.  Monitor networks connections (Connectivity Verification,
       Continuity Check).

   2.  Troubleshoot failures (Fault verification and localization).

   3.  Monitor Performance

   An overview of OAM tools is presented in [RFC7276].  Over the years,
   many technologies have developed similar tools for fault and
   performance management.

   [IEEE802.1ag] Connectivity Fault Management is a well-established OAM
   standard that is widely adopted for Ethernet networks.  ITU-T
   [G.8013], MEF Service OAM, MPLS-TP [RFC6371], TRILL [RFC7455] all
   define OAM mechanisms based on the manageability frame work of CFM
   [IEEE802.1ag].

   Given the wide adoption of the underlying OAM concepts defined in CFM
   [IEEE802.1ag], it is a reasonable choice to develop the unified
   management framework for connection oriented OAM based on those
   concepts.  In this document, we take the CFM [IEEE802.1ag] model and
   extend it to a technology independent framework and define the
   corresponding YANG model accordingly.  The YANG model presented in
   this document is the base model for connection oriented OAM protocols
   and supports generic continuity check, connectivity verification and
   path discovery (traceroute).  The generic YANG model for connection
   oriented OAM is designed to be extensible to other connection
   oriented technologies.  Technology dependent nodes and remote process
   call (RPC) commands are defined in technology specific YANG models,
   which use and extend the base model defined here.  As an example,
   VXLAN uses source UDP port number for flow entropy, while TRILL uses
   either MAC addresses, the VLAN tag or fine grain label, and/or IP
   addresses for flow entropy in the hashing for multipath selection.
   To capture this variation, corresponding YANG models would define the
   applicable structures as augmentation to the generic base model
   presented here.  This accomplishes three goals: First it keeps each
   YANG model smaller and more manageable.  Second, it allows
   independent development of corresponding YANG models.  Third,
   implementations can limit support to only the applicable set of YANG
   models. (e.g.  TRILL RBridge may only need to implement Generic model
   and the TRILL YANG model).

Internet-Draft     Connection-Oriented OAM YANG model         April 2017


   All implementations that follow the YANG framework presented in this
   document MUST implement the generic connection oriented YANG model
   presented here.

   The YANG data model presented in this document is generated at the
   management layer.  Encapsulations and state machines may differ
   according to each OAM protocol.  A user who wishes to issues a
   Continuity Check command or a Loopback or initiate a performance
   monitoring session can do so in the same manner regardless of the
   underlying protocol or technology or specific vendor implementation.

   As an example, consider a scenario where Loopback from device A to
   Device B fails.  Between device A and B there are IEEE 802.1 bridges
   a, b and c.  Let's assume a,b and c are using CFM [IEEE802.1ag].
   Upon detecting the Loopback failures, a user may decide to drill down
   to the lower level at different segments of the path and issue the
   corresponding fault verification (LBM) and fault isolation (LTM)
   tools, using the same API.  This ability to drill down to a lower
   layer of the protocol stack at a specific segment within a path for
   fault localization and troubleshooting is referred to as "nested OAM
   workflow".  It is a useful concept that leads to efficient network
   troubleshooting and maintenance workflows.  The connection oriented
   OAM YANG model presented in this document facilitates that without
   needing changes to the underlying protocols.

3.  Architecture of Generic YANG Model for OAM

   In this document we define a generic YANG model for connection
   oriented OAM protocols.  The YANG model defined here is generic in a
   sense that other technologies can extend it for technology specific
   needs.  The Generic YANG model acts as the root for other OAM YANG
   models.  This allows users to traverse between different OAM
   protocols with ease through a uniform API set.  This also enables a
   nested OAM workflow.  Figure 1 depicts the relationship of different
   OAM YANG models to the Generic YANG Model for connection oriented
   OAM.  The Generic YANG model for OAM provides a framework where
   technology- specific YANG models can inherit constructs from the base
   YANG models without needing to redefine them within the sub-
   technology.

        Relationship of OAM YANG model to generic (base) YANG model

4.  Overview of the OAM Model

   In this document we adopt the concepts of the CFM [IEEE802.1ag] model
   and structure it such that it can be adapted to different connection
   oriented OAM protocols.

   At the top of the Model is the Maintenance Domain.  Each Maintenance
   Domain is associated with a Maintenance Name and a Domain Level.

   Under each Maintenance Domain there is one or more Maintenance
   Association (MA).  In TRILL this can be per Fine-Grained Label or for
   VPLS this can be per VPLS instance [RFC6136].

   Under each MA, there can be two or more MEPs (Maintenance End
   Points).  MEPs are addressed by their respective technology specific
   address identifiers.  The YANG model presented here provides
   flexibility to accommodate different addressing schemes.

Internet-Draft     Connection-Oriented OAM YANG model         April 2017


   In the vertical direction orthogonal to the Maintenance Domain,
   presented are the commands.  Those, in YANG terms, are the RPC
   commands.  These RPC commands provide uniform APIs for continuity
   check, connectivity verification, path discovery(traceroute) and
   their equivalents as well as other OAM commands.

   The OAM entities in the generic YANG model defined here will be
   either explicitly or implicitly configured using any of the OAM
   tools.  The OAM tools used here are limited to OAM toolset specified
   in section 5.1 of [RFC7276].  In order to facilitate zero-touch
   experience, this document defines a default mode of OAM.  The default
   mode of OAM is referred to as the Base Mode and specifies default
   values for each of model parameters, such as Maintenance Domain
   Level, Name of the Maintenance Association, Addresses of MEPs and so
   on.  The default values of these depend on the technology.  Base Mode
   for TRILL is defined in [RFC7455].  Base mode for other technologies
   and future extensions developed in IETF will be defined in their
   corresponding documents.

   It is important to note that, no specific enhancements are needed in
   the YANG model to support Base Mode.  Implementations that comply
   with this document, by default implement the data nodes of the
   applicable technology.  Data nodes of the Base Mode are read-only
   nodes.

4.1.  Maintenance Domain (MD) configuration

   The container "domains" is the top level container within the gen-oam
   module.  Within the container "domains", separate list is maintained
   per MD.  The MD list uses the key MD-name-string for indexing.  MD-
   name-string is a leaf and derived from type string.  Additional name
   formats as defined in [IEEE802.1ag] or other standards can be
   included by association of the MD-name-format with an identity-ref.
   MD-name-format indicates the format of the augmented MD-names.  MD-
   name is presented as choice/case construct.  Thus, it is easily
   augmentable by derivative work.

4.4.  RPC definitions

   The RPC model facilitates issuing commands to a NETCONF server (in
   this case to the device that need to execute the OAM command) and
   obtain a response.  RPC model defined here abstracts OAM specific
   commands in a technology independent manner.

   There are several RPC commands defined for the purpose of OAM.  In
   this section we present a snippet of the continuity check command for
   illustration purposes.  Please refer to Section 4.5 for the complete
   data hierarchy and Section 5 for the YANG model.

4.5.  Notifications

   Notification is sent on defect condition and defect clears with
   Maintenance Domain Name, MA Name, defect-type (The currently active
   defects), generating-mepid, and defect-message to indicate more
   details.

4.6.  Monitor statistics

   Grouping for monitoring statistics is to be used by Yang modules
   which Augment Yang to provide statistics due to pro-active OAM like
   CCM Messages.  For example CCM Transmit, CCM Receive, CCM Errors,
   etc.

6.  Base Mode

   The Base Mode ('default mode' described in section 4) defines default
   configuration that MUST be present in the devices that comply with
   this document.  Base Mode allows users to have "zero-touch"
   experience.  Several parameters require technology specific
   definition.

6.1.  MEP Address

   In the Base Mode of operation, the MEP Address is by default the IP
   address of the interface on which the MEP is located.

Internet-Draft     Connection-Oriented OAM YANG model         April 2017


6.2.  MEP ID for Base Mode

   In the Base Mode of operation, each device creates a single MEP
   associated with a virtual OAM port with no physical layer (NULL PHY).
   The MEP-ID associated with this MEP is zero (0).  The choice of MEP-
   ID zero is explained below.

   MEP-ID is 2 octet field by default.  It is never used on the wire
   except when using CCM.  It is important to have method that can
   derive MEP-ID of base mode in an automatic manner with no user
   intervention.  IP address cannot be directly used for this purpose as
   the MEP-ID is much smaller field.  For Base Mode of operation we
   propose to use MEP-ID zero (0) as the default MEP-ID.

   CCM packet use MEP-ID on the payload.  CCM MUST NOT be used in the
   Base Mode.  Hence CCM MUST be disabled on the Maintenance Association
   of the Base Mode.

   If CCM is required, users MUST configure a separate Maintenance
   association and assign unique value for the corresponding MEP IDs.

   CFM [IEEE802.1ag] defines MEP ID as an unsigned integer in the range
   1 to 8191.  In this document we propose extend the range to 0 to
   65535.  Value 0 is reserved for MEP-ID of Base Mode operation and
   MUST NOT be used for other purposes.

6.3.  Maintenance Association

   The ID of the Maintenance Association (MA-ID) [IEEE802.1ag] has a
   flexible format and includes two parts: Maintenance Domain Name and
   Short MA name.  In the Based Mode of operation, the value of the
   Maintenance Domain Name must be the character string
   "GenericBaseMode" (excluding the quotes ").  In Base Mode operation
   Short MA Name format is set to 2-octet integer format (value 3 in
   Short MA Format field [IEEE802.1ag]) and Short MA name set to 65532
   (0xFFFC).

7.  Connection-oriented OAM YANG model applicability

   "ietf-conn-oam" model defined in this document provides technology-
   independent abstraction of key OAM constructs for connection oriented
   protocols.  This model can be further extended to include technology
   specific details, e.g., adding new data nodes with technology
   specific functions and parameters into proper anchor points of the
   base model, so as to develop a technology-specific connection-
   oriented OAM model.

Internet-Draft     Connection-Oriented OAM YANG model         April 2017


   This section demonstrates the usability of the connection-oriented
   YANG OAM data model to various connection-oriented OAM technologies,
   e.g., TRILL and MPLS-TP.  Note that, in this section, we only present
   several snippets of technology-specific model extensions for
   illustrative purposes.  The complete model extensions should be
   worked on in respective protocol working groups.

7.1.  Generic YANG Model extension for TRILL OAM

   The TRILL YANG module is augmenting connection oriented OAM module
   for both configuration and RPC commands.

   The TRILL YANG module requires the base TRILL module ([I-D.ietf-
   trill-yang]) to be supported as there is a strong relationship
   between those modules.

   The configuration extensions for connection oriented OAM include MD
   configuration extension, Technology type extension, MA configuration
   extension, Connectivity-Context Extension, MEP Configuration
   Extension, ECMP extension.  In the RPC extension, the continuity-
   check and path-discovery RPC are extended with TRILL specific.

7.1.1.  MD Configuration Extension

   MD level configuration parameters are management information which
   can be inherited in the TRILL OAM model and set by connection
   oriented base model as default values.  For example domain name can
   be set to area-ID in the TRILL OAM case.  In addition, at the
   Maintenance Domain level, domain data node at root level can be
   augmented with technology type.

   Note that MD level configuration parameters provides context
   information for management system to correlate faults, defects,
   network failures with location information, which helps quickly
   identify root causes of network failures.

7.1.1.1.  Technology Type Extension

   No TRILL technology type has been defined in the connection oriented
   base model.  Therefore a technology type extension is required in the
   TRILL OAM model.  The technology type "trill" is defined as an
   identity that augments the base "technology-types" defined in the
   connection oriented base model:

      identity trill{
       base goam:technology-types;
       description
        "trill type";
      }

7.1.2.  MA Configuration Extension

   MA level configuration parameters are management information which
   can be inherited in the TRILL OAM model and set by connection
   oriented base model as default values.  In addition, at the
   Maintenance Association(MA) level, MA data node at the second level
   can be augmented with connectivity-context extension.

   Note that MA level configuration parameters provides context
   information for management system to correlate faults, defects,
   network failures with location information, which helps quickly
   identify root causes of network failures.

7.1.2.1.  Connectivity-Context Extension

   In TRILL OAM, one example of connectivity-context is either a 12 bit
   VLAN ID or a 24 bit Fine Grain Label.  The connection oriented base
   model defines a placeholder for context-id.  This allows other
   technologies to easily augment that to include technology specific
   extensions.  The snippet below depicts an example of augmenting
   connectivity-context to include either VLAN ID or Fine Grain Label.

      augment /goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs
      /goam:MA /goam:connectivity-context:
            +--:(connectivity-context-vlan)
            |  +--rw connectivity-context-vlan?   vlan
            +--:(connectivity-context-fgl)
               +--rw connectivity-context-fgl?    fgl

7.1.3.  MEP Configuration Extension

   The MEP configuration definition in the connection oriented base
   model already supports configuring the interface of MEP with either
   MAC address or IP address.  In addition, the MEP address can be
   represented using a 2 octet RBridge Nickname in TRILL OAM . Hence,
   the TRILL OAM model augments the MEP configuration in base model to
   add a nickname case into the MEP address choice node as follows:

   augment /goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs
      /goam:MA/ goam:MEP/goam:mep-address:
            +--:( mep-address-trill)
            |  +--rw mep-address-trill?  tril-rb-nickname

Internet-Draft     Connection-Oriented OAM YANG model         April 2017


   In addition, at the Maintenance Association Endpoint(MEP) level, MEP
   data node at the third level can be augmented with ECMP extension.

7.1.3.1.  ECMP Extension

   Since TRILL supports ECMP path selection, flow-entropy in TRILL is
   defined as a 96 octet field in the LIME model extension for TRILL
   OAM.  The snippet below illustrates its extension.

    augment /goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA/goam:MEP:
               +--rw flow-entropy-trill?   flow-entropy-trill
      augment /goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA/goam:MEP
      /goam:session:
               +--rw flow-entropy-trill?   flow-entropy-trill

7.1.4.  RPC extension

   In the TRILL OAM YANG model, the continuity-check and path-discovery
   RPC commands are extended with TRILL specific requirements.  The
   snippet below depicts an example of illustrates the TRILL OAM RPC
   extension.

7.2.  Generic YANG Model extension for MPLS-TP OAM

   The MPLS-TP OAM YANG module can augment connection oriented OAM
   Module with some technology-specific details.  And the
   [mpls-tp-oam-yang] presents the YANG Data model for MPLS-TP OAM.

   The configuration extensions for connection oriented OAM include MD
   configuration extension, Technology type extension, Sub Technology
   Type Extension ,MA configuration extension, MEP Configuration
   Extension.

7.2.1.  MD Configuration Extension

   MD level configuration parameters are management information which
   can be inherited in the MPLS-TP OAM model and set by LIME base model
   as default values.  For example domain name can be set to area-ID or
   the provider's Autonomous System Number(ASN) [RFC6370] in the MPLS-TP
   OAM case.  In addition, at the Maintenance Domain level, domain data

   node at root level can be augmented with technology type and sub-
   technology type.

   Note that MD level configuration parameters provides context
   information for management system to correlate faults, defects,
   network failures with location information, which helps quickly
   identify root causes of network failures

7.2.1.1.  Technology Type Extension

   No MPLS-TP technology type has been defined in the connection
   oriented base model, hence it is required in the MPLS OAM model.  The
   technology type "mpls-tp" is defined as an identity that augments the
   base "technology-types" defined in the connection oriented base
   model:

       identity mpls-tp{
             base goam:technology-types;
             description
              "mpls-tp type";
            }

7.2.1.2.  Sub Technology Type Extension

   In MPLS-TP, since different encapsulation types such as IP/UDP
   Encapsulation, PW-ACH encapsulation can be employed, the "technology-
   sub-type" data node is defined and added into the MPLS OAM model to
   further identify the encapsulation types within the MPLS-TP OAM
   model.  Based on it, we also define a technology sub-type for IP/UDP
   encapsulation and PW-ACH encapsulation.  Other Encapsulation types
   can be defined in the same way.  The snippet below depicts an example
   of several encapsulation types.

   identity technology-sub-type {
         description
         "certain implementations can have different
          encapsulation types such as ip/udp, pw-ach and so on.
          Instead of defining separate models for each
          encapsulation, we define a technology sub-type to
       further identify different encapsulations.
       Technology sub-type is associated at the MA level"; }

              identity technology-sub-type-udp {
                base technology-sub-type;
                description
                  "technology sub-type is IP/UDP encapsulation";
              }

              identity technology-sub-type-ach {
                base technology-sub-type;
                description
                  "technology sub-type is PW-ACH encapsulation";
              }
              }

         augment "/goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA" {
                leaf technology-sub-type {
                  type identityref {
                    base technology-sub-type;
                  }
                }
              }

7.2.2.  MA Configuration Extension

   MA level configuration parameters are management information which
   can be inherited in the MPLS-TP OAM model and set by Connection
   Oriented base model as default values.  One example of MA Name could
   be MEG LSP ID or MEG Section ID or MEG PW ID[RFC6370].

   Note that MA level configuration parameters provides context
   information for management system to correlate faults, defects,
   network failures with location information, which helps quickly
   identify root causes of network failures.

7.2.3.  MEP Configuration Extension

   In MPLS-TP, MEP-ID is either a variable length label value in case of
   G-ACH encapsulation or a 2 octet unsigned integer value in case of
   IP/UDP encapsulation.  One example of MEP-ID is MPLS-TP LSP_MEP_ID
   [RFC6370].  In the connection-oriented base model, MEP-ID is defined

   as a choice/case node which can supports an int32 value, and the same
   definition can be used for MPLS-TP with no further modification.  In
   addition, at the Maintenance Association Endpoint(MEP) level, MEP
   data node at the third level can be augmented with Session extension
   and interface extension.

8.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed via
   the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241] [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is SSH [RFC6242] [RFC6242].  The NETCONF access control
   model [RFC6536] [RFC6536] provides the means to restrict access for
   particular NETCONF users to a pre-configured subset of all available
   NETCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG module which are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., <edit-config>)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.

   The vulnerable "config true" subtrees and data nodes are the
   following:

   /goam:domains/goam:domain/

   /goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA/

   /goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA/goam:MEP

   /goam:domains/goam:domain/goam:MAs/goam:MA/goam:MEP/goam:session/

   Unauthorized access to any of these lists can adversely affect OAM
   management system handling of end-to-end OAM and coordination of OAM
   within underlying network layers This may lead to inconsistent
   configuration, reporting, and presentation for the OAM mechanisms
   used to manage the network.
