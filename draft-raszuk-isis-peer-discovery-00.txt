Abstract

   This document proposes an extension to IS-IS protocol [ISO10589] to
   support BGP peer auto discovery.

   We propose the addition of new information that an Intermediate
   System can flood in it's LSPDU. Such information is required for
   network based auto discovery of IBGP peers as described in [IBGP-AM].

Internet Draft        ISIS Ext for IBGP Auto Mesh              June 2003


1. Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2. Introduction

   Today all BGP peering configuration is manual and requires action on
   both sides of any given peering. In IBGP Auto Mesh draft [IBGP-AM] we
   propose the automation of this task for IBGP sessions. As a
   distribution of required information IS-IS [ISO10589] native flooding
   layer is being proposed for reuse.

   The information required to be flooded is static and can change only
   by operator's manual configuration action.

   It is envisioned that in the future when new and better approaches
   for flooding information are available and deployed BGP Auto
   Discovery TLV could also be migrated from ISIS to such a new
   transport.


3. The BGP Auto Discovery TLV

   BGP Auto Discovery TLV is an IS-IS TLV of type code 243 (to be
   confirmed).

   The format of BGP Auto Discovery TLV is indicated for reference in
   Figure 1 below.

    0                   1                   2                   3

                  Figure 1. BGP Auto Discovery TLV

   Type    - Code 243 (to be confirmed)
   Length  - Total length in octets

   Control Flags related to IGP operation:

   Symbol    Capabilities

   F         Flooding scope
   D         Down Bit

   "F" {flooding} flooding scope of this TLV, when set domain wide
       flooding scope is required, when not set TLV should not be
       flooded into other areas or levels. Default not set
       indicating area/level wide flooding only.

   "D" {down} down bit set by IGP when leaked to other levels.

   BGP Auto Discovery TLV can be contained in any LSP fragment. It also
   can be repeated. BGP itself will take all necessary filtering/update
   actions on reception of this information from ISIS.

   The minimum TLV length can be 10 octets.

   When a size of the TLV reaches 255 octets BGP will fragment the TLV.
   A special "FRAG" 4 bit counter has been allocated in the BGP Control
   Information section for unlikely cases where BGP Auto Discovery TLV
   needs to be splitted across multiple TLVs for a given BGP speaker.
   Fragmentation should be fully transparent to ISIS component.

   The specific information and encoding of BGP sub-TLVs is discussed in
   [IBGP-AM].

4. Operation

   It should be important to emphasize the fact that ISIS interaction
   with the new information is to remain minimal. BGP component will
   prepare the necessary information to be flooded as well as keep the
   received information in it's own data structure (cache). BGP
   component will also inform ISIS about required flooding scope for
   it's information by setting the F bit.

   It is assumed that all global LSP comparison will still take place.
   On the other hand it is not required that ISIS will try to parse and
   compare the TLV itself and based on the result initiate BGP
   notification or not. Added checksum field should make comparison done
   by BGP much less CPU intensive.

   Forced reflooding should only take place based on the manual
   configuration change of session related parameters. During normal
   network operation when BGP configuration related to peer maintenance
   is constant BGP Auto Discovery TLV should not cause any extra
   processing or flooding for ISIS.


5. Deployment Considerations

   The new proposed data to be flooded has an informational character.
   Routers which do not understand new information will not be able to
   participate in the IBGP auto mesh.

   Deployment of new code which supports new information can be
   incremental. Also enabling information distribution itself can also
   have an incremental character.

   It should be up to operator's decision to switch from informational
   use of BGP Auto Discovery TLV to operational IBGP auto mesh benefits.


6. IANA Considerations

   A new ISIS TLV type will need to be assigned by IANA. The TLV
   assignee will be responsible for allocation of any sub-TLVs for the
   IANA assigned TLV.

7. Security Considerations

   It is highly encouraged to use existing ISIS security mechanism when
   transporting BGP Auto Discovery TLV.

   While addition of new information does not present any additional
   risks, potential consequences of injection of not authorized BGP Auto
   Discovery TLVs into routing domain could by minimized by
   implementation of additional filtering before attempting to establish
   IBGP sessions.
