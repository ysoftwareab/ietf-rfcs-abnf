Internet-Draft    Centralized Conferencing (XCON) Media Models      February 2004


1. Introduction

   There is debate about how one should control the centralized mixing
   service in the XCON framework.  We term this control media policy.

   Some offer low-level manipulation of media streams and resources on a
   per-user basis.  Others offer models based on end-device negotiation
   of streams of interest and doing local manipulation.  Yet others
   offer models based on fixed frameworks and user roles to indirectly
   determine the media policay.

   In one sense, the different models are isomorphic.  One can construct
   the end-device-centric model from the low-level model.  Likewise, one
   can construct the frameworks-and-roles model from the
   end-device-centric or the low-level model.  Given this, it is
   important to consider the use cases for media policy manipulation.
   As this document will assert, the different models impose quite
   different requirements on the endpoints.

   Another factor this document will examine is the ease of
   implementation, both of the server (mixer) and client (endpoint).

   Everything needs to loop back to and have examples for how to meet
   the Conferencing Scenarios draft [1].

2. Low-Level Stream Control

2.1 Decription

   Low-level stream control is where the endpoint manipulates a direct
   representation of the media processing resources of the mixer.  This
   representation can be physical, as in terms of directly plumbing DSP
   resources in the manner of H.248.1.  The representation can be
   logical, as in terms of XML mappings of DSP topologies.

2.2 Benefits

   This is the most flexible model available.  Just as one can construct
   all logic circuits from an OR gate and a NOT gate, one can construct
   all possible media mixing scenarios from a two-input mixer and an
   attinuator.

2.3 Drawbacks

   Unless the mixer physically maps to the primitives of the device
   control model, it is very conceivable for a legal mixing request to
   be unrenderable by the mixing device.  For example, an 8-input mixer
   with the loudest three talkers with four outputs being the full mix,

   the mix less the loudest talker, the mix less the second loudest
   talker, and the mix less the third loudest talker is a 13-element
   composition (7x 2-input mixers, 3x loudest talker selectors, and 3x
   2-input mixers with "not loudest talkers").  The mixing device must
   be able to map the representation into primitives it understands,
   such as an 8-input mixer.

   Another drawback is the mixer may not be able to globally optimize
   the mixing resources, as there are many ways of representing the same
   mix result.  For small mixers, this is a denial of service
   opportunity.  For large mixers, properly scaling the system requires
   minimizing the resource utilization for the average conference.

   Finally, this model requires the endpoint developer to be an expert
   in DSP technology.  This is because the developer has to manage and
   manipulate the DSP resources at a fairly low level.

3. Individual End-Point Negotiation

3.1 Decription

   The individual end-point negotiation model is where the endpoint
   negotiates directly with other conference endpoints and does any
   mixing locally.  One often finds this model for small audio or
   multimedia conferences.  If the endpoint wants a big video window, it
   will ask the remote endpoint for a big video transmission.  If the
   endpoint wants a thumbnail, it asks for a thumbnail.

   With the streams, the endpoint locally composes whatever layout or
   mixing policy it feels like.

   This model often relies on the us of silence-suppression codecs to
   reduce bandwidth to the endpoint and make active talker
   identification easier.  For the most part, only two people will try
   to talk for more than 500ms.  Human protocol usually results on one
   of the participants to backoff.

3.2 Benefits

   The main benefit of this model is the user is in complete control of
   their experience.  There are no questions about whether a mixing
   service can support the user interface, whether because of resource
   availability, computational complexity, or forsight into the possible
   media manipulation needs.

3.3 Drawbacks

   All media must traverse the network from all endpoints to the given

   endpoint.  This is not realistic for Internet-scale protocols.

   There is no centralized control of policy such as floor control.  For
   example, the moderator may wish to mute a particular speaker; the
   endpoint may still allow that speaker into the mix, ignoring the
   moderators mute request.

   The endpoint developer must be able to put together the media
   manipulation on their own.  For example, mixing; video demodulation,
   mixing, and remodulation; and stream selection are all now endpoint
   functions.

4. Role-Directed Control

4.1 Decription

   In role-directed control, the mixing service provides a set of
   templates for which different users have different roles.  The roles
   in the template dictates the media policy.  For example, in a lecture
   template, there is a lecturer and possibly listeners and questioners.
   The moderator is the only stream in the mix, unless a user becomes a
   questioner.  As a questioner, their media is added appropriately to
   the mix.  While straightforward for audio, the mix for video is more
   involved.  A likely scenario is to have multiple templates for
   different preferences, such as video switching to the current
   speaker, split pane with the lecturer and current questioner, and so
   on.

4.2 Benefits

   The endpoint operates at the level of a conference.  It only needs to
   know what role the user wants to be.  It does not need to know
   anything about DSP primitives or plumbing.

4.3 Drawbacks

   There is unquestionably a loss of generality with role-directed
   control.  However, that loss is made up with an increase in
   usability.

5. Other Thoughts

   BOBW: Role-Directed Control with a Framework Markup language?

   the above mentioned denial of service opportunities some of the
