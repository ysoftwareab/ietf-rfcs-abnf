 IPv6-based discovery and association of Virtualization Infrastructure
 Manager (VIM) and Network Function Virtualization Orchestrator (NFVO)
                 draft-bernardos-nfvrg-vim-discovery-00

Abstract

   Virtualized resources do not need to be limited to those available in
   traditional data centers, where the infrastructure is stable, static,
   typically homogeneous and managed by a single admin entity.
   Computational capabilities are becoming more and more ubiquitous,
   with terminal devices getting extremely powerful, as well as other
   types of devices that are close to the end users at the edge (e.g.,
   vehicular onboard devices for infotainment, micro data centers
   deployed at the edge, etc.).  It is envisioned that these devices
   would be able to offer storage, computing and networking resources to
   nearby network infrastructure, devices and things (the fog paradigm).
   These resources can be used to host functions, for example to
   offload/complement other resources available at traditional data
   centers, but also to reduce the end-to-end latency or to provide
   access to specialized information (e.g., context available at the
   edge) or hardware.

   This document describes mechanisms allowing dynamic discovery of
   virtualization resources and orchestrators in IPv6-based networks.
   New IPv6 neighbor discovery options are defined.

1.  Introduction

   The telecommunications sector is experiencing a major revolution that
   will shape the way networks and services are designed and deployed
   for the next decade.  We are witnessing an explosion in the number of
   applications and services demanded by users, which are now really
   capable of accessing them on the move.  In order to cope with such a
   demand, some network operators are looking at the cloud computing
   paradigm, which enables a potential reduction of the overall costs by
   outsourcing communication services from specific hardware in the
   operator's core to server farms scattered in data centers.  These
   services have different characteristics if compared with conventional
   IT services that have to be taken into account in this cloudification
   process.  Also the transport network is affected in that it is

   evolving to a more sophisticated form of IP architecture with trends
   like separation of control and data plane traffic, and more fine-
   grained forwarding of packets (beyond looking at the destination IP
   address) in the network to fulfill new business and service goals.

   Virtualization of functions also provides operators with tools to
   deploy new services much faster, as compared to the traditional use
   of monolithic and tightly integrated dedicated machinery.  As a
   natural next step, mobile network operators need to re-think how to
   evolve their existing network infrastructures and how to deploy new
   ones to address the challenges posed by the increasing customers'
   demands, as well as by the huge competition among operators.  All
   these changes are triggering the need for a modification in the way
   operators and infrastructure providers operate their networks, as
   they need to significantly reduce the costs incurred in deploying a
   new service and operating it.  Some of the mechanisms that are being
   considered and already adopted by operators include: sharing of
   network infrastructure to reduce costs, virtualization of core
   servers running in data centers as a way of supporting their load-
   aware elastic dimensioning, and dynamic energy policies to reduce the
   monthly electricity bill.  However, this has proved to be tough to
   put in practice, and not enough.  Indeed, it is not easy to deploy
   new mechanisms in a running operational network due to the high
   dependency on proprietary (and sometime obscure) protocols and
   interfaces, which are complex to manage and often require configuring
   multiple devices in a decentralized way.

   Network function virtualization (NFV) [etsi_nfv_whitepaper] and
   software defined networking (SDN) [onf_sdn_architecture] are changing
   the way the telecommunications sector will deploy, extend and operate
   their networks.  The ETSI NFV Industry Specification Group (ISG) is
   developing the baseline NFV architecture, under some assumptions to
   make this development easier.  One of these assumptions is that the
   resources used to run the virtualized functions are well known in
   advance by the management and orchestration entities, as well as
   stable.  This document goes beyond this assumption
   [I-D.irtf-nfvrg-gaps-network-virtualization], by describing
   mechanisms allowing dynamic discovery of virtualization resources and
   orchestrators in IPv6-based networks.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   While [RFC2119] describes interpretations of these key words in terms
   of protocol specifications and implementations, they are used in this

   document to describe requirements for the SFC mechanisms to
   efficiently enable fog RAN.

   The following terms used in this document are defined by the ETSI NFV
   ISG, the ONF and the IETF:

      NFV Infrastructure (NFVI): totality of all hardware and software
      components which build up the environment in which VNFs are
      deployed

      NFV Management and Orchestration (NFV-MANO): functions
      collectively provided by NFVO, VNFM, and VIM.

      NFV Orchestrator (NFVO): functional block that manages the Network
      Service (NS) lifecycle and coordinates the management of NS
      lifecycle, VNF lifecycle (supported by the VNFM) and NFVI
      resources (supported by the VIM) to ensure an optimized allocation
      of the necessary resources and connectivity.

      Virtualized Infrastructure Manager (VIM): functional block that is
      responsible for controlling and managing the NFVI compute, storage
      and network resources, usually within one operator's
      Infrastructure Domain.

      Virtualized Network Function (VNF): implementation of a Network
      Function that can be deployed on a Network Function Virtualisation
      Infrastructure (NFVI).

      Virtualized Network Function Manager (VNFM): functional block that
      is responsible for the lifecycle management of VNF.

3.  Network Function Virtualization

   The ETSI ISG NFV is a working group which, since 2012, aims to evolve
   quasi-standard IT virtualization technology to consolidate many
   network equipment types into industry standard high volume servers,
   switches, and storage.  It enables implementing network functions in
   software that can run on a range of industry standard server hardware
   and can be moved to, or loaded in, various locations in the network
   as required, without the need to install new equipment.  The ETSI NFV
   is one of the predominant NFV reference framework and architectural
   footprints [nfv_sota_research_challenges].  The ETSI NFV framework
   architecture framework is composed of three domains (Figure 1):

   o  Virtualized Network Function, running over the NFVI.

   o  NFV Infrastructure (NFVI), including the diversity of physical
      resources and how these can be virtualized.  NFVI supports the
      execution of the VNFs.

   o  NFV Management and Orchestration, which covers the orchestration
      and life-cycle management of physical and/or software resources
      that support the infrastructure virtualization, and the life-cycle
      management of VNFs.  NFV Management and Orchestration focuses on
      all virtualization specific management tasks necessary in the NFV
      framework.

   The NFV architectural framework identifies functional blocks and the
   main reference points between such blocks.  Some of these are already
   present in current deployments, whilst others might be necessary
   additions in order to support the virtualization process and
   consequent operation.  The functional blocks are (Figure 2):

4.  Fog Virtualization Overview

   Virtualization is invading all domains of the E2E 5G network,
   including the access, as a mean to achieve the necessary flexibility
   in support of the E2E slicing concept.  The ETSI NFV framework is the
   cornerstone for making virtualization such a promising technology
   that can be matured in time for 5G.  Typically, virtualization has
   been mostly envisaged in the core network, where sophisticated data
   centers and clouds provided the right substrate.  And mostly, the
   framework focused on virtualizing network functions, so called VNFs
   (virtualized network functions), which were somewhat limited to
   functions that are delay tolerant, typically from the core and
   aggregation transport.

   As the community has recently been developing the 5G applications and
   their technical requirements, it has become clear that certain
   applications would require very low latency which is extremely
   challenging and stressing for the network to deliver through a pure
   centralized architecture.  The need to provide networking, computing,
   and storage capabilities closer to the users has therefore emerged,
   leading to what is known today as the concept of intelligent edge.
   ETSI has been the first to address this need recently by developing
   the framework of mobile edge computing (MEC).

   Such an intelligent edge could not be envisaged without
   virtualization.  Beyond applications, it raises a clear opportunity
   for networking functions to execute at the edge benefiting from
   inherent low latencies.

   Whilst it is appreciated the particular challenge for the intelligent
   edge concept in dealing with mobile users, the edge virtualization
   substrate has been largely assumed to be fixed or stationary.
   Although little developed, the intelligent edge concept is being
   extended further to scenarios where for example the edge computing
   substrate is on the move, e.g., on-board a car or a train, or that it
   is distributed further down the edge, even integrating resources from
   different stakeholders, into what is known as the fog.  The
   challenges and opportunities for such extensions of the intelligent
   edge remain an exciting area of future research.

   Figure 3 shows a diagram representing the fog virtualization concept.
   The fog is composed by virtual resources on top of heterogeneous
   resources available at the edge and even further in the RAN and end-
   user devices.  These resources are therefore owned by different
   stakeholders who collaboratively form a single hosting environment
   for the VNFs to run.  As an example, virtual resources provided to
   the fog might be running on eNBs, APs, at micro data centers deployed
   in shopping malls, cars, trains, etc.  The fog is connected to data

   centers deeper into the network architecture (at the edge ir the
   core).  On the top part of the figure, an example of user and control
   plane VNFs is shown.  User plane VNFs are represented as "fx", and
   control ones as "ctrlx".  Depending on the functionality implemented
   by these VNFs and the service requirements, these VNFs would be
   mapped (i.e., instantiated) differently to the physical resouces (as
   described in [I-D.aranda-sfc-dp-mobile]).

   Virtualized resources do not need to be limited to those available in
   traditional data centers, where the infrastructure is stable, static,
   typically homogeneous and managed by a single admin entity.
   Computational capabilities are becoming more and more ubiquitous,

   with terminal devices getting extremely powerful, as well as other
   types of devices that are close to the end users at the edge (e.g.,
   vehicular onboard devices for infotainment, micro data centers
   deployed at the edge, etc.).  It is envisioned that these devices
   would be able to offer storage, computing and networking resources to
   nearby network infrastructure, devices and things (the fog paradigm).
   These resources can be used to host functions, for example to
   offload/complement other resources available at traditional data
   centers, but also to reduce the end-to-end latency or to provide
   access to specialized information (e.g., context available at the
   edge) or hardware.

   Since the fog resources are volatile, i.e. may dynamically appear and
   disappear, and may be mobile, i.e. may move from one place to
   another, mechanisms to discover and advertise virtualized fog
   resources are required.

   Taking ETSI NFV architecture (see Section 3) as a baseline for the
   virtualization of the fog nodes, the discovery of a virtualization
   resource can be done either through (i) the discovery of NFVI from a
   VIM; or through (ii) the discovery of VIMs and associated NFVI from
   an NFVO.  In this document we focus on the alternative ii) that is
   the discovery of the VIMs and NFVI from an NFVO.  This is so because
   a VIM is typically NFVI-specific, and therefore these two are more
   often than not tied together.

   The relationship between an NFVO and the resources it is capable to
   orchestrate through a VIM is statically defined according to the
   current ETSI NFV specifications [etsi_nfv_002] [etsi_nfv_ifa_005].
   The interface Or-Vi (between NFVO and VIM) [etsi_nfv_ifa_005] does
   not include any discovery and automatic registration of (mobile) VIMs
   from a (mobile) NFVO.

6.  Advertisement and discovery of mobile resources (VIM+NFVI)

   This document describes IPv6 extensions to allow discovery of
   virtualization resources, in the form of a VIM + associated NFVI.
   Examples of scenarios where this is useful are shown in Figure 4 and
   Figure 5, including also a high-level view of the solution.

                     Figure 4: VIM+NFVI advertisement

   Figure 4 shows an scenario in which a mobile terminal with available
   resources (NFVI, and associated VIM) attaches to a network (step 1).
   Then, it advertises (step 2) that it has virtualization resources
   (and their characteristics, such as the type of VIM) that could be
   eventually used.  An NFVO sitting in the network can then decide to
   register the VIM for later use (step 3).  This document specifies
   some options for step 2 based on IP signaling.  Step 3 is
   implementation dependent and very much VIM-NFVO specific.

   Similarly, Figure 5 shows a scenario with a mobile NFVO.  A mobile
   terminal with an embedded NFVO attaches to a network (step 1).  Then,
   it queries the network (step 2) to learn if there are virtualization
   resources available.  If so, the network conveys that information
   (step 3).  The NFVO can then decide to register the VIM for later use
   (step 4).  This document specifies some options for steps 2 and 3
   based on IP signaling.  Step 4 is implementation dependent and very
   much VIM-NFVO specific.
