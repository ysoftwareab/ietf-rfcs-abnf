</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">This document introduces the FCAST reliable and scalable object (e.g., file) delivery application. Two variants of FCAST exist: </p>

<ul>
<li>FCAST/ALC that relies on the Asynchronous Layer Coding (ALC) <a href="#RFC5775">[RFC5775]</a> and the Layered Coding Transport (LCT) <a href="#RFC5651">[RFC5651]</a> reliable multicast transport protocol, and</li>
<li>FCAST/NORM that relies on the NACK-Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) <a href="#RFC5740">[RFC5740]</a> reliable multicast transport protocol.</li>
</ul>

<p> Hereafter, the term FCAST denotes either FCAST/ALC or FCAST/NORM.  FCAST is not a new protocol specification per se. Instead it is a set of data format specifications and instructions on how to use ALC and NORM to implement a file-casting service.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">Depending on the target use case, the delivery service provided by FCAST is more or less reliable. For instance, with FCAST/ALC used in ON-DEMAND mode over a time period that largely exceeds the typical download time, the service can be considered as fully reliable.  Similarly, when FCAST is used along with a session control application that collects reception information and takes appropriate corrective measures (e.g., a direct point-to-point retransmission of missing packets, or a new multicast recovery session), then the service can be considered as fully reliable. On the opposite, if FCAST operates in PUSH mode, then the service is usually only partially reliable, and a receiver that is disconnected during a sufficient time will perhaps not have the possibility to download the object.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">Depending on the target use case, the FCAST scalability is more or less important. For instance, if FCAST/ALC is used on top of purely unidirectional transport channels, with no feedback information at all, which is the default mode of operation, then the scalability is maximum since neither FCAST, nor ALC, UDP or IP generates any feedback message.  On the opposite, the FCAST/NORM scalability is typically limited by NORM scalability itself. Similarly, if FCAST is used along with a session control application that collects reception information from the receivers, then this session control application may limit the scalability of the global object delivery system. This situation can of course be mitigated by using a hierarchy of feedback message aggregators or servers. The details of this are out of the scope of the present document.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">A design goal behind FCAST is to define a streamlined solution, in order to enable lightweight implementations of the protocol stack, and limit the operational processing and storage requirements. A consequence of this choice is that FCAST cannot be considered as a versatile application, capable of addressing all the possible use-cases. On the opposite, FCAST has some intrinsic limitations. From this point of view it differs from FLUTE <a href="#RMT-FLUTE">[RMT-FLUTE]</a> which favors flexibility at the expense of some additional complexity.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">A good example of the design choices meant to favor the simplicity is the way FCAST manages the object meta-data: by default, the meta-data and the object content are sent together, in a compound object. This solution has many advantages in terms of simplicity as will be described later on. However, as such, it also has an intrinsic limitation since it does not enable a receiver to decide in advance, before beginning the reception of the compound object, whether the object is of interest or not, based on the information that may be provided in the meta-data.  Therefore this document defines additional techniques that may be used to mitigate this limitation. It is also possible that some use-cases require that each receiver download the whole set of objects sent in the session (e.g., with mirroring tools). When this is the case, the above limitation is no longer be a problem.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.1">The basic goal of FCAST is to transmit objects to a group of receivers in a reliable way. The receiver set MAY be restricted to a single receiver or MAY include possibly a very large number of receivers. FCAST is specified to support two forms of operation:</p>

<ol>
<li>FCAST/ALC: where the FCAST application is meant to run on top of the ALC/LCT reliable multicast transport protocol, and</li>
<li>FCAST/NORM: where the FCAST application is meant to run on top of the NORM reliable multicast transport protocol.</li>
</ol>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.2">This specification is designed such that both forms of operation share as much commonality as possible.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.3">While the choice of the underlying transport protocol (i.e., ALC or NORM) and its parameters may limit the practical receiver group size, nothing in FCAST itself limits it. The transmission might be fully reliable, or only partially reliable depending upon the way ALC or NORM is used (e.g., whether FEC encoding and/or NACK-based repair requests are used or not), the way the FCAST carousel is used (e.g., whether the objects are made available for a long time span or not), and the way in which FCAST itself is employed (e.g., whether there is a session control application that might automatically extend an existing FCAST session until all receivers have received the transmitted content).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.4">FCAST is designed to be as self-sufficient as possible, in particular in the way object meta-data is attached to object data content. However, for some uses, meta-data MAY also be communicated by an out-of-band mechanism that is out of the scope of the present document.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.2">4.2.</a> <a href="#meta-data_tx" id="meta-data_tx">Meta-Data Transmission</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.1">FCAST usually carries meta-data elements by prepending them to the object it refers to. As a result, a Compound Object is created that is composed of a header followed by the original object data. This header is itself composed of the meta-data as well as several fields, for instance to indicate the boundaries between the various parts of this Compound Object (<a href="#fig_compound_obj">Figure 1</a>).</p>
<div id="#rfc.figure.1"></div>
<div id="#fig_compound_obj"></div>
<pre>
&lt;------------------------ Compound Object -----------------------&gt;
+-------------------------+--------------------------------------+
|  Compound Object Header |              Object Data             |
| (can include meta-data) |       (can be encoded by FCAST)      |
+-------------------------+--------------------------------------+
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.2">Attaching the meta-data to the object is an efficient solution, since it guaranties that meta-data be received along with the associated object, and it allows the transport of the meta-data to benefit from any transport-layer erasure protection of the Compound Object (e.g., using FEC encoding and/or NACK-based repair). However a limit of this scheme, as such, is that a client does not know the meta-data of an object before beginning its reception, and in case of erasures affecting the meta-data, not until the object decoding is completed. The details of course depend upon the transport protocol and the FEC code used.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.3">In certain use-cases, FCAST can also be associated to another in-band (e.g., via NORM INFO messages, <a href="#norm_specifics">Section 4.8</a>) or out-of-band signaling mechanism.  In that case, this mechanism can be used in order to carry the whole meta-data (or a subset of it), possibly ahead of time.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.3">4.3.</a> <a href="#meta-data_content" id="meta-data_content">Meta-Data Content</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.1">The meta-data associated to an object can be composed of, but are not limited to: </p>

<ul>
<li>Content-Location: the URI of the object, which gives the name and location of the object;</li>
<li>Content-Type: the MIME type of the object;</li>
<li>Content-Length: the size of the initial object, before any content encoding (if any). Note that this content length does not include the meta-data nor the fixed size Compound Object header;</li>
<li>Content-Encoding: the optional encoding of the object performed by FCAST. If there is no Content-Encoding entry, the receiver MUST assume that the object is not encoded (default). The support of gzip encoding, or any other solution, remains optional.</li>
<li>Content-MD5: the MD5 message digest of the object in order to check its integrity. Note that this digest is meant to protect from transmission and processing errors, not from deliberate attacks by an intelligent attacker. Note also that this digest only protects the object, not the header, and therefore not the meta-data. A separate checksum is provided to that purpose (<a href="#header_format">Section 5.1</a>);</li>
<li>a digital signature for this object;</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.2">This list is not limited and new meta-data information can be added. For instance, when dealing with very large objects (e.g., that largely exceed the working memory of a receiver), it can be interesting to split this object into several sub-objects (or slices).  When this happens, the meta-data associated to each sub-object MUST include the following entries: </p>

<ul>
<li>Fcast-Obj-Slice-Nb: the total number of slices. A value strictly greater than 1 indicates that this object is the result of a split of the original object;</li>
<li>Fcast-Obj-Slice-Idx: the slice index (in the {0 .. SliceNb - 1} interval);</li>
<li>Fcast-Obj-Slice-Offset: the offset at which this slice starts within the original object;</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.3">When meta-data elements are communicated out-of-band, in advance of data transmission, the following pieces of information MAY also be useful: </p>

<ul>
<li>TOI: the Transmission Object Identifier (TOI) of the object (<a href="#object_id">Section 4.6</a>), in order to enable a receiver to easily associate the meta-data to the object;</li>
<li>FEC Object Transmission Information (FEC OTI). In this case the FCAST sender does not need to use the optional EXT_FTI mechanism of the ALC or NORM protocols.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.4">4.4.</a> <a href="#carousel" id="carousel">Carousel Transmission</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.p.1">A set of FCAST Compound Objects scheduled for transmission are considered a logical "Carousel". A given "Carousel Instance" is comprised of a fixed set of Compound Objects. Whenever the FCAST application needs to add new Compound Objects to, or remove old Compound Objects from the transmission set, a new Carousel Instance is defined since the set of Compound Objects changes.  Because of the native object multiplexing capability of both ALC and NORM, sender and receiver(s) are both capable to multiplex and demultiplex FCAST Compound Objects.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.p.2">For a given Carousel Instance, one or more transmission cycles are possible. During each cycle, all of the Compound Objects comprising the Carousel are sent. By default, each object is transmitted once per cycle. However, in order to allow different levels of priority, some objects MAY be transmitted more often that others during a cycle, and/or benefit from higher FEC protection than others. This can be the case for instance for the CID objects (<a href="#cio">Section 4.5</a>). For some FCAST usage (e.g., a unidirectional "push" mode), a Carousel Instance may be associated to a single transmission cycle. In other cases it may be associated to a large number of transmission cycles (e.g., in "on-demand" mode, where objects are made available for download during a long period of time).</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.5">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.5">4.5.</a> <a href="#cio" id="cio">Carousel Instance Descriptor Special Object</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.5.p.1">The FCAST sender CAN transmit an OPTIONAL Carousel Instance Descriptor (CID). The CID carries the list of the Compound Objects that are part of a given Carousel Instance, by specifying their respective Transmission Object Identifiers (TOI). However the CID does not describe the objects themselves (i.e., there is no meta-data).  Additionally, the CID MAY include a "Complete" flag that is used to indicate that no further modification to the enclosed list will be done in the future. Finally, the CID MAY include a Carousel Instance ID that identifies the Carousel Instance it pertains to. These aspects are discussed in <a href="#carousel_instance_descr">Section 5.2</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.5.p.2">There is no reserved TOI value for the CID Compound Object itself, since this special object is regarded by ALC/LCT or NORM as a standard object.  On the opposite, the nature of this object (CID) is indicated by means of a specific Compound Object header field (the "I" flag) so that it can be recognized and processed by the FCAST application as needed. A direct consequence is the following: since a receiver does not know in advance which TOI will be used for the following CID (in case of a dynamic session), he MUST NOT filter out packets that are not in the current CID's TOI list. Said differently, the goal of CID is not to setup ALC or NORM packet filters (this mechanism would not be secure in any case).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.5.p.3">The use of a CID remains optional. If it is not used, then the clients progressively learn what files are part of the carousel instance by receiving ALC or NORM packets with new TOIs. However using a CID has several benefits: </p>

<ul>
<li>When the "Complete" flag is set (if ever), the receivers know when they can leave the session, i.e., when they have received all the objects that are part of the last carousel instance of this delivery session;</li>
<li>In case of a session with a dynamic set of objects, the sender can reliably inform the receivers that some objects have been removed from the carousel with the CID. This solution is more robust than the "Close Object flag (B)" of ALC/LCT since a client with an intermittent connectivity might loose all the packets containing this B flag. And while NORM provides a robust object cancellation mechanism in the form of its NORM_CMD(SQUELCH) message in response to receiver NACK repair requests, the use of the CID provides an additional means for receivers to learn of objects for which it is futile to request repair;</li>
<li>The TOI equivalence (<a href="#object_id">Section 4.6</a>) can be signaled with the CID. This is often preferable to the alternative solution where the equivalence is identified by examining the object meta-data, especially in case of erasures.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.4.5.p.4">During idle periods, when the carousel instance does not contain any object, a CID with an empty TOI list MAY be transmitted. In that case, a new carousel instance ID MUST be used to differentiate this (empty) carousel instance from the other ones. This mechanism can be useful to inform the receivers that: </p>

<ul>
<li>all the previously sent objects have been removed from the carousel. It therefore improves the FCAST robustness even during "idle" period;</li>
<li>the session is still active even if there is currently no content being sent. Said differently, it can be used as a heartbeat mechanism. If the "Complete" flag has not been set, it implicitly informs the receivers that new objects MAY be sent in the future;</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.4.5.p.5">The decisions of whether a CID should be used or not, how often and when a CID should be sent, are left to the sender and depend on many parameters, including the target use case and the session dynamics.  For instance it may be appropriate to send a CID at the beginning of each new carousel instance, and then periodically. These operational aspects are out of the scope of the present document.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.6">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.6">4.6.</a> <a href="#object_id" id="object_id">Compound Object Identification</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.6.p.1">The FCAST Compound Objects are directly associated with the object-based transport service that the ALC and NORM protocols provide. In each of these protocols, the messages containing transport object content are labeled with a numeric transport object identifier (i.e., the ALC TOI and the NORM NormTransportId). For the purposes of this document, this identifier in either case (ALC or NORM) is referred to as the TOI.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.6.p.2">There are several differences between ALC and NORM: </p>

<ul>
<li>the ALC use of TOI is rather flexible, since several TOI field sizes are possible (from 16 to 112 bits), since this size can be changed at any time, on a per-packet basis, and since the TOI management is totally free as long as each object is associated to a unique TOI (if no wraparound happened);</li>
<li>the NORM use of TOI is more directive, since the TOI field is 16 bit long and since TOIs MUST be managed sequentially;</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.4.6.p.3">In both NORM and ALC, it is possible that the transport identification space may eventually wrap for long-lived sessions (especially with NORM where this phenomenon is expected to happen more frequently). This can possibly introduce some ambiguity in FCAST object identification if a sender retains some older objects in newer Carousel Instances with updated object sets.  To avoid ambiguity the active TOIs (i.e., the TOIs corresponding to objects being transmitted) can only occupy half of the TOI sequence space. If an old object, whose TOI has fallen outside the current window, needs to be transmitted again, a new TOI must be used for it.  In case of NORM, this constraint limits to 32768 the maximum number of objects that can be part of any carousel instance. In order to allow receivers to properly combine the transport packets with a newly-assigned TOI to those of associated to the previously-assigned TOI, a mechanism is required to equate the objects with the new and the old TOIs.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.6.p.4">The preferred mechanism consists in signaling, within the CID, that the newly assigned TOI, for the current Carousel Instance, is equivalent to the TOI used within a previous Carousel Instance. By convention, the reference tuple for any object is the {TOI; CI ID} tuple used for its first transmission within a Carousel Instance. This tuple MUST be used whenever a TOI equivalence is provided.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.6.p.5">An alternative solution, when meta-data can be processed rapidly (e.g., by using NORM-INFO messages), consists for the receiver in identifying that both objects are the same, after examining the meta-data. The receiver can then take appropriate measures.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.8.p.1">The NORM Protocol provides a few additional capabilities that can be used to specifically support FCAST operation:</p>
<p></p>

<ol>
<li>The NORM_INFO message can convey "out-of-band" content with respect to a given transport object. With FCAST, it MAY be used to provide to the receivers a new, associated, Compound Object which contains the main Compound Object meta-data, or a subset of it.  In that case the NORM_INFO Compound Object MUST NOT contain any Object Data field (i.e., it is only composed of the header), it MUST feature a non global checksum, and it MUST NOT include any padding field. The main Compound Object MUST in any case contain the whole meta-data (e.g., because a receiver MAY not support the NORM_INFO facility). Additionally, the meta-data entries contained in the NORM_INFO MUST be identical to the same entries in the main Compound Object. Finally, note that the availability of NORM_INFO for a given object is signaled through the use of a dedicated flag in the NORM_DATA message header. Along with NORM's NACK-based repair request signaling, it allows a receiver to quickly (and independently) request an object's NORM_INFO content. However, a limitation here is that the NORM_INFO Compound Object header MUST fit within the byte size limit defined by the NORM sender's configured "segment size" (typically a little less than the network MTU);</li>
<li>The NORM_CMD(SQUELCH) messages are used by the NORM protocol sender to inform receivers of objects that have been canceled when receivers make repair requests for such invalid objects. Along with the CID mechanism, a receiver has two efficient and reliable ways to discover old objects that have been removed from the carousel instance;</li>
<li>NORM also supports an optional positive acknowledgment mechanism that can be used for small-scale multicast receiver group sizes. Also, it may be possible in some cases for the sender to infer, after some period without receiving NACKs at the end of its transmission that the receiver set has fully received the transmitted content. In particular, if the sender completes its end-of-transmission series of NORM_CMD(FLUSH) messages without receiving repair requests from the group, it may have some assurance that the receiver set has received the content prior to that point. These mechanisms are likely to help FCAST in achieving fully reliable transmissions;</li>
</ol>
<p id="rfc.section.4.8.p.3">It should be noted that the NORM_INFO message header may carry the EXT_FTI extension. The reliable delivery of the NORM_INFO content allows the individual objects' FEC Transmission Information to be provided to the receivers without burdening every packet (i.e.  NORM_DATA messages) with this additional, but important, content.  Examples are provided in <a href="#fcast_exple">Appendix Appendix A</a>.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.9.p.1">The following operations MAY take place at a sender: </p>

<ol>
<li>The user (or another application) selects a set of objects (e.g., files) to deliver and submits them, along with their meta-data, to the FCAST application;</li>
<li>For each object, FCAST creates the Compound Object and registers this latter in the carousel instance;</li>
<li>The user then informs FCAST that all the objects of the set have been submitted. If the user knows that no new object will be submitted in the future (i.e., if the session's content is now complete), the user informs FCAST. Finally, the user specifies how many transmission cycles are desired (this number may be infinite);</li>
<li>At this point, the FCAST application knows the full list of Compound Objects that are part of the Carousel Instance and can create a CID if desired, possibly with the complete flag set;</li>
<li>The FCAST application can now define a transmission schedule of these Compound Objects, including the optional CID. This schedule defines in which order the packets of the various Compound Objects should be sent. This document does not specify any scheme. This is left to the developer within the provisions of the underlying ALC or NORM protocol used and the knowledge of the target use-case.</li>
<li>The FCAST application then starts the carousel transmission, for the number of cycles specified. Transmissions take place until: <ul>
<li>the desired number of transmission cycles has been reached, or</li>
<li>the user wants to prematurely stop the transmissions, or</li>
<li>the user wants to add one or several new objects to the carousel, or on the opposite wants to remove old objects from the carousel. In that case a new carousel instance must be created.</li>

<li>When a Compound Object has been entirely received, the receiver processes the header, retrieves the object meta-data, perhaps decodes the meta-data, and processes the object accordingly;</li>
<li>When a CID is received, which is indicated by the 'C' flag set in the Compound Object header, the receiver decodes the CID, and retrieves the list of objects that are part of the current carousel instance.

<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.2">Because the CID is transmitted as a special Compound Object, the following CID-specific meta-data entries are defined: </p>

<ul>
<li>Fcast-CID-Complete: when set to 1, it indicates that no new objects in addition to the ones whose TOI are specified in this CID, or the ones that have been specified in the previous CID(s), will be sent in the future. Otherwise it MUST be set to 0. This entry is optional. If absent, a receiver MUST conclude that the session is complete.</li>
<li>Fcast-CID-ID: this entry contains the Carousel Instance IDentifier, or CIID.  It starts from 0 and is incremented by 1 for each new carousel instance. This entry is optional if the FCAST session consists of a single, complete, carousel instance. In all other cases, this entry MUST be defined. In particular, the CIID is used by the TOI equivalence mechanism thanks to which any object is uniquely identified, even if the TOI is updated (e.g., after re-enqueuing the object with NORM). The Fcast-CID-ID value can also be useful to detect possible gaps in the Carousel Instances, for instance caused by long disconnection periods. Finally, it can also be useful to avoid problems when TOI wrapping to 0 takes place to differentiate the various incarnations of the TOIs if need be.</li>
</ul>

<p> The motivation for making the Fcast-CID-Complete and Fcast-CID-ID entries optional is to simplify the simple case of a session consisting of a single, complete, carousel instance, with an Object List given in plain text, without any content encoding.  In that case, the CID does not need to contain any meta-data entry.</p>
<div id="#rfc.figure.4"></div>
<pre>        Content-Encoding: gzip  </pre>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.3">Additionally, the following standard meta-data entries are often used (<a href="#meta-data_content">Section 4.3</a>): </p>

<ul>
<li>Content-Length: it specifies the size of the object list, before any content encoding (if any).</li>
<li>Content-Encoding: it specifies the optional encoding of the object list, performed by FCAST. For instance: <a href="#RFC1952">[RFC1952]</a>. If there is no Content-Encoding entry, the receiver MUST assume that the Object List field is plain text (default). The support of gzip encoding, or any other solution, remains optional.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.4">An empty Object List is valid and indicates that the current carousel instance does not include any object (<a href="#cio">Section 4.5</a>). This can be specified by using the following meta-data entry: </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.5">The non-encoded (i.e., plain text) Object List, when non empty, is a NULL-terminated ASCII string. It can contain two things: </p>

<ul>
<li>a list of TOI values, and</li>
<li>a list of TOI equivalences;</li>
</ul>

<p> First of all, this string can contain the list of TOIs included in the current carousel instance, specified either as the individual TOIs of each object, or as TOI intervals, or any combination. The format of the ASCII string is a comma-separated list of individual "TOI" values or "TOI_a-TOI_b" elements. This latter case means that all values between TOI_a and TOI_b, inclusive, are part of the list. In that case TOI_a MUST be strictly inferior to TOI_b. If a TOI wrapping to 0 occurs in an interval, then two TOI intervals MUST be specified, TOI_a-MAX_TOI and 0-TOI_b.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.6">This string can also contain the TOI equivalences, if any. The format is a comma-separated list of "(" newTOI "=" 1stTOI "/" 1stCIID ")" elements. Each element says that the new TOI, for the current Carousel Instance, is equivalent to (i.e., refers to the same object as) the provided identifier, 1stTOI, for the Carousel Instance of ID 1stCIID.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.7">The ABNF specification is the following:</p>
<div id="#rfc.figure.6"></div>
<pre>cid-list   =  *(list-elem *( "," list-elem))
list-elem    =  toi-elem / toieq-elem
toi-elem     =  toi-value / toi-interval
toi-value    =  1*DIGIT
toi-interval =  toi-value "-" toi-value
                ; additionally, the first toi-value MUST be
                ; strictly inferior to the second toi-value
toieq-elem   =  "(" toi-value "=" toi-value "/" ciid-value ")"
ciid-value   = 1*DIGIT
DIGIT        =  %x30-39
                ; a digit between O and 9, inclusive</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.8">For readability purposes, it is RECOMMENDED that all the TOI values in the list be given in increasing order. However a receiver MUST be able to handle non-monotonically increasing values. It is also RECOMMENDED to group the TOI equivalence elements together, at the end of the list, in increasing newTOI order. However a receiver MUST be able to handle lists of mixed TOI and TOI equivalence elements.  Specifying a TOI equivalence for a given newTOI relieves the sender from specifying newTOI explicitly in the TOI list. However a receiver MUST be able to handle situations where the same TOI appears both in the TOI value and TOI equivalence lists. Finally, a given TOI value or TOI equivalence item MUST NOT be included multiple times in either list.</p>

<ul>
<li>attacks that are meant to give access to a confidential object (e.g., in case of a non-free content) and</li>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.2.p.1">Protection against corruptions (e.g., if an attacker sends forged packets) is achieved by means of a content integrity verification/sender authentication scheme. This service can be provided at the object level, but in that case a receiver has no way to identify which symbol(s) is(are) corrupted if the object is detected as corrupted.  This service can also be provided at the packet level. In this case, after removing all corrupted packets, the file may be in some cases recovered. Several techniques can provide this content integrity/sender authentication service: </p>

<ul>
<li>at the object level, the object can be digitally signed, for instance by using RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 <a href="#RFC3447">[RFC3447]</a>.  This signature enables a receiver to check the object integrity, once this latter has been fully decoded. Even if digital signatures are computationally expensive, this calculation occurs only once per object, which is usually acceptable;</li>
<li>at the packet level, each packet can be digitally signed <a href="#RMT-SIMPLE-AUTH">[RMT-SIMPLE-AUTH]</a>.  A major limitation is the high computational and transmission overheads that this solution requires. To avoid this problem, the signature may span a set of packets (instead of a single one) in order to amortize the signature calculation. But if a single packets is missing, the integrity of the whole set cannot be checked;</li>
<li>at the packet level, a Group Message Authentication Code (MAC) <a href="#RFC2104">[RFC2104]</a><a href="#RMT-SIMPLE-AUTH">[RMT-SIMPLE-AUTH]</a> scheme can be used, for instance by using HMAC-SHA-256 with a secret key shared by all the group members, senders and receivers. This technique creates a cryptographically secured digest of a packet that is sent along with the packet. The Group MAC scheme does not create prohibitive processing load nor transmission overhead, but it has a major limitation: it only provides a group authentication/integrity service since all group members share the same secret group key, which means that each member can send a forged packet. It is therefore restricted to situations where group members are fully trusted (or in association with another technique as a pre-check);</li>
<li>at the packet level, Timed Efficient Stream Loss-Tolerant Authentication (TESLA) <a href="#RFC4082">[RFC4082]</a><a href="#RFC5776">[RFC5776]</a> is an attractive solution that is robust to losses, provides a true authentication/integrity service, and does not create any prohibitive processing load or transmission overhead. Yet checking a packet requires a small delay (a second or more) after its reception;</li>
<li>at the packet level, IPsec/ESP <a href="#RFC4303">[RFC4303]</a> can be used to check the integrity and authenticate the sender of all the packets being exchanged in a session (see <a href="#min-sec-recommendations">Section 6.5</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.2.p.2">Techniques relying on public key cryptography (digital signatures and TESLA during the bootstrap process, when used) require that public keys be securely associated to the entities. This can be achieved by a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), or by a PGP Web of Trust, or by pre-distributing securely the public keys of each group member.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.2.p.3">Techniques relying on symmetric key cryptography (Group MAC) require that a secret key be shared by all group members. This can be achieved by means of a group key management protocol, or simply by pre-distributing securely the secret key (but this manual solution has many limitations).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.2.p.4">It is up to the developer and deployer, who know the security requirements and features of the target application area, to define which solution is the most appropriate. In any case, whenever there is any concern of the threat of file corruption, it is RECOMMENDED that at least one of these techniques be used.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.3.1.p.2">To avoid these problems, it is RECOMMENDED that measures be taken to prevent receivers from accepting incorrect Session Descriptions.  One such measure is the sender authentication to ensure that receivers only accept legitimate Session Descriptions from authorized senders. How these measures are achieved is outside the scope of this document since this session description is usually carried out-of-band.</p>

For example, sending forged ALC packets with the Close Session flag (A) set to one can lead the receiver to prematurely close the session.

<p id="rfc.section.6.3.5.p.1">Let us first focus on the congestion control building block that may be used in an ALC or NORM session. A receiver with an incorrect or corrupted implementation of the multiple rate congestion control building block may affect the health of the network in the path between the sender and the receiver. That may also affect the reception rates of other receivers who joined the session.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.5.p.2">When congestion control is applied with FCAST, it is therefore RECOMMENDED that receivers be required to identify themselves as legitimate before they receive the Session Description needed to join the session. If authenticating a receiver does not prevent this latter to launch an attack, it will enable the network operator to identify him and to take counter-measures. This authentication can be made either toward the network operator or the session sender (or a representative of the sender) in case of NORM. The details of how it is done are outside the scope of this document.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.5.p.3">When congestion control is applied with FCAST, it is also RECOMMENDED that a packet level authentication scheme be used, as explained in <a href="#obj_corruption">Section 6.2.2</a>. Some of them, like TESLA, only provide a delayed authentication service, whereas congestion control requires a rapid reaction. It is therefore RECOMMENDED <a href="#RFC5775">[RFC5775]</a> that a receiver using TESLA quickly reduces its subscription level when the receiver believes that a congestion did occur, even if the packet has not yet been authenticated. Therefore TESLA will not prevent DoS attacks where an attacker makes the receiver believe that a congestion occurred. This is an issue for the receiver, but this will not compromise the network.  Other authentication methods that do not feature this delayed authentication could be preferred, or a group MAC scheme could be used in parallel to TESLA to prevent attacks launched from outside of the group.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.4.p.1">Lastly, we note that the security considerations that apply to, and are described in, ALC <a href="#RFC5775">[RFC5775]</a>, LCT <a href="#RFC5651">[RFC5651]</a>, NORM <a href="#RFC5740">[RFC5740]</a> and FEC <a href="#RFC5052">[RFC5052]</a> also apply to FCAST as FCAST builds on those specifications. In addition, any security considerations that apply to any congestion control building block used in conjunction with FCAST also applies to FCAST. Finally, the security discussion of <a href="#RMT-SEC">[RMT-SEC]</a> also applies here.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.6.5">
<a href="#rfc.section.6.5">6.5.</a> <a href="#min-sec-recommendations" id="min-sec-recommendations">Minimum Security Recommendations</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.5.p.1">We now introduce a mandatory to implement but not necessarily to use security configuration, in the sense of <a href="#RFC3365">[RFC3365]</a>.  Since FCAST/ALC relies on ALC/LCT, it inherits the "baseline secure ALC operation" of <a href="#RFC5775">[RFC5775]</a>.  Similarly, since FCAST/NORM relies on NORM, it inherits the "baseline secure NORM operation" of <a href="#RFC5740">[RFC5740]</a>.  More precisely, in both cases security is achieved by means of IPsec/ESP in transport mode.  <a href="#RFC4303">[RFC4303]</a> explains that ESP can be used to potentially provide confidentiality, data origin authentication, content integrity, anti-replay and (limited) traffic flow confidentiality.  <a href="#RFC5775">[RFC5775]</a> specifies that the data origin authentication, content integrity and anti-replay services SHALL be used, and that the confidentiality service is RECOMMENDED.  If a short lived session MAY rely on manual keying, it is also RECOMMENDED that an automated key management scheme be used, especially in case of long lived sessions.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.5.p.2">Therefore, the RECOMMENDED solution for FCAST provides per-packet security, with data origin authentication, integrity verification and anti-replay.  This is sufficient to prevent most of the in-band attacks listed above.  If confidentiality is required, a per-packet encryption SHOULD also be used.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.2.p.2">The NORM_INFO message shown in <a href="#expl_norm_info">Figure 14</a> contains the EXT_FTI header extension to carry the FEC OTI. In this example, the FEC OTI format is that of the Reed-Solomon FEC coding scheme for fec_id = 5 as described in <a href="#RFC5510">[RFC5510]</a>. Other alternatives for providing the FEC OTI would have been to either include it directly in the meta-data of the FCAST Compound Header, or to include an EXT_FTI header extension to all NORM_DATA packets (or a subset of them). Note that the NORM "Transfer_Length" is the total length of the associated FCAST Compound Object, i.e., 41 bytes.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.2.p.3">The FCAST Compound Object in this example does contain the same meta-data and is formatted as in the example of <a href="#expl_object">Figure 9</a>. With the combination of the FEC_OTI and the FCAST meta-data, the NORM protocol and FCAST application have all of the information needed to reliably receive and process the associated object. Indeed, the NORM protocol provides rapid (NORM_INFO has precedence over the associated object content), reliable delivery of the NORM_INFO message and its payload, the FCAST Compound Object Header.</p>
