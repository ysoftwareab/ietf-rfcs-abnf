 1. Introduction

    This memo outlines in broader terms how data plane protocols
    can assist in meeting the operations and management (OAM)
    requirements outlined in [MPLSREQS] and [Y1710] and can apply to 
    the management functions of fault, configuration, accounting, 
    performance and security (commonly known as FCAPS) for MPLS networks 
    as defined in [RFC3031]. The approach of the document is to outline 
    functionality, the potential mechanisms to provide the function and
    the required the applicability of data plane OAM functions. Included 
    in the discussion are security issues specific to use of tools 
    within a provider domain and use for inter provider LSPs.

 3. Fault Management

 3.1 Fault detection

    Fault detection encompasses the identification of all data 
    plane failures between the ingress and egress of an LSP.
    This section will enumerate common failure scenarios and
    explain how one might (or might not) detect the situation.

 3.1.1 Enumeration and detection of types of data plane faults

    Lower layer faults:

         Lower layer faults are those in the physical or virtual link
         that impact the transport of MPLS labeled packets between
         adjacent LSRs at the specific level of interest. Some physical
         links (such as SONET/SDH) may have link layer OAM functionality
         and detect and notify the LSR of link layer faults directly.
         Some physical links (such as Ethernet) may not have this
         capability and require MPLS or IP layer heartbeats to detect
         failures. However, once detected, reaction to these fault
         notifications is often the same as those described in the first
         case.

    Node failures:

         Node failures are those that impact the forwarding capability
         of a node component, including its entire set of links. This
         can be due to component failure, power outage, or reset of
         control processor in an LSR employing a distributed
         architecture, etc.

    MPLS LSP misforwarding:

         Misforwarding occurs when there is a loss of synchronization
         between the data and the control planes in one or more nodes.
         This can occur due to hardware failure, software failure or
         configuration problems.

         It will manifest itself in one of two forms:

         - packets belonging to a particular LSP are cross-connected
           into an NHLFE for which there is no corresponding ILM at
           the next downstream LSR. This can occur in cases where the



MPLS Working Group            Expires August 2005            [Page 3]

Internet Draft            MPLS OAM Framework            February 2005



           NHLFE entry is corrupted. Therefore the packet arrives at
           the next LSR with a top label value for which the LSR has no
           corresponding forwarding information, and is typically
           dropped. This is a No Incoming Label Map (No ILM) condition and
           can be detected directly by the downstream LSR which
           receives the incorrectly labeled packet.

         - packets belonging to a particular LSP are cross-connected
           into an incorrect NHLFE entry for which there is a
           corresponding ILM at the next downstream LSR, but is
           associated with a different LSP. This may be detected by
           a number of means:
              o some or all of the misdirected traffic is not routable
                at the egress node.
              o Or OAM probing is able to detect the fault by detecting
                the inconsistency between the data path and the control
                plane state.

    Discontinuities in the MPLS Encapsulation
         The forwarding path of the FEC carried by an LSP may transit
         nodes or links for which MPLS is not configured. This may 
         result in a number of behaviors which are undesirable and not 
         easily detected
         - if exposed payload is not routable at the LSR resulting in
         silent discard OR
         - the exposed MPLS label was not offered by the LSR which may
         result in either silent discard or misforwarding

         Alternately the payload may be routable and packets 
         successfully delivered but bypasses associated MPLS 
         instrumentation and tools.

    MTU problems
         MTU problems occur when client traffic cannot be fragmented by
         intermediate LSRs, and is dropped somewhere along the path of
         the LSP. MTU problems should appear as a discrepancy in the
         traffic count between the set of ingresses and the egresses for
         a FEC and will appear in the corresponding MPLS MIB performance
         tables in the transit LSRs as discarded packets.

    TTL Mishandling
         The implementation of TTL handling is inconsistent at 
         penultimate hop LSRs. Tools that rely on consistent TTL 
         processing may produce inconsistent results in any given 
         network.

    Congestion
         Congestion occurs when the offered load on any interface
         exceeds the link capacity for sufficient time that the
         interface buffering is exhausted. Congestion problems will

Internet Draft            MPLS OAM Framework            February 2005



         appear as a discrepancy in the traffic count between the set of
         ingresses and the egresses for a FEC and will appear in the
         MPLS MIB performance tables in the transit LSRs as discarded
         packets.

    Misordering
         Misordering of LSP traffic occurs when incorrect or
         inappropriate load sharing is implemented within an MPLS
         network. Load sharing typically takes place when equal cost
         paths exist between the ingress and egress of an LSP. In these
         cases, traffic is split among these equal cost paths using a
         variety of algorithms. One such algorithm relies on splitting
         traffic between each path on a per-packet basis. When this is
         done, it is possible for some packets along the path to be
         delayed due to congestion or slower links, which may result in
         packets being received out of order at the egress. Detection
         and remedy of this situation may be left up to client
         applications that use the LSPs. For instance, TCP is capable of
         re-ordering packets belonging to a specific flow.

         Detection of mis-ordering can also be determined by sending 
         probe traffic along the path and verifying that all probe 
         traffic is indeed received in the order it was transmitted. 
         This will only detect truly pathological problems as 
         misordering typically is an insufficiently predictable and 
         repeatable problem.

         LSRs do not normally implement mechanisms to detect misordering
         of flows.

    Payload Corruption
         Payload corruption may occur and be undetectable by LSRs. Such
         errors are typically detected by client payload integrity
         mechanisms.

 3.1.2 Timeliness

    The design of SLAs and management support systems requires that
    ample headroom be alloted in terms of their processing capabilites
    in order to process and handle all necessary fault conditions
    within the bounds stipulated in the SLA. This includes planning for
    event handling using a time budget which takes into account the
    over-all SLA and time to address any defects which arise. However,
    it is possible that some fault conditions may surpass this budget
    due their catastrophic nature (e.g.: fibre cut) or due to
    misplanning of the time processing budget.

        |    |           v
        v    -------------

        Figure 1: Fault Correction Budget

    In figure 1, we represent the overall fault correction time budget
    by the maximum time as specified in an SLA for the service in
    question. This time is then divided into two subsections, the first
    encompassing the total time required to detect a fault and notify an
    operator (or optionally automatically correct the defect). This
    section may have an explicit maximum time to detect defects arising
    from either the application or a need to do alarm management (i.e.:
    supression) and this will be reflected in the frequency of OAM
    execution. The second section indicates the time required to notify
    the operational systems used to diagnose, isolate and correct the
    defect (if they cannot be corrected automatically).


 3.2 Diagnosis

 3.2.1 Characterization

    Characterization is defined as determining the forwarding path of a
    packet (which may not be necessarily known). Characterization may be
    performed on a working path through the network. This is done for
    example, to determine ECMP paths, the MTU of a path, or simply to
    know the path occupied by a specific FEC. Characterization will be
    able to leverage mechanisms used for isolation.

 3.2.2 Isolation

    Isolation of a fault can occur in two forms. In the first case, the
    local failure is detected, and the node where the failure occurred
    is capable of issuing an alarm for such an event. The node should
    attempt to withdraw the defective resources and/or rectify the
    situation prior to raising an alarm. Active data plane OAM
    mechanisms may also detect the failure conditions remotely and issue
    their own alarms if the situation is not rectified quickly enough.

    In the second case, the fault has not been detected locally. In this
    case, the local node cannot raise an alarm, nor can it be expected
    to rectify the situation. In this case, the failure may be detected
    remotely via data plane OAM.  This mechanism should also be able to
    determine the location of the fault, perhaps on the basis of limited
    information such as a customer complaint. This mechanism may also be
    able to automatically remove the defective resources from and the



MPLS Working Group            Expires August 2005            [Page 6]

Internet Draft            MPLS OAM Framework            February 2005



    network and restore service, but should at least provide a network
    operator with enough information by which they can perform this
    operation. Given that detection of faults is desired to happen as
    quickly as possible, tools which posses the ability to incrementally
    test LSP health should be used to uncover faults.

 3.3 Availability

    Availability is the measure of the percentage of time that a service
    is operating within specification, often specified by an SLA.

    MPLS has several forwarding modes (depending on the control plane
    used). As such more than one model may be defined and require more
    than one measurement technique.


 4.  Configuration Management

    Data plane OAM can assist in configuration management by providing
    the ability to verify the configuration of an LSP or of applications
    utilizing that LSP. This would be an ad-hoc data plane probe
    that should both verify path integrity (a complete path exists) as
    well as verifying that the path function is synchronized with the
    control plane. The probe would carry as part of the payload relevant
    control plane information that the receiver would be able to compare
    with the local control plane configuration.

 5. Accounting

    The requirements for accounting in MPLS networks as specified in
    [MPLSREQS] do not place any requirements on data plane OAM.

 6.  Performance Management

    Performance management permits the information transfer
    characteristics of LSPs to be measured, perhaps in order to
    compare against an SLA. This falls into two categories, latency
    (where jitter is considered a variation in latency) and information
    loss.

    Latency can be measured in two ways: one is to have precisely
    synchronized clocks at the ingress and egress such that timestamps
    in PDUs flowing from the ingress to the egress can be compared. The
    other is to use an exchange of PING type PDUs that gives a round
    trip time (RTT) measurement, and an estimate of the one way latency
    can be inferred with some loss of precision. Use of load spreading
    techniques such as ECMP mean that any individual RTT measurement is
    only representative of the typical RTT for a FEC.

    To measure information loss, a common practice is to periodically



MPLS Working Group            Expires August 2005            [Page 7]

Internet Draft            MPLS OAM Framework            February 2005



    read ingress and egress counters (i.e.: MIB module counters). This
    information may also be used for offline correlation. Another common
    practice is to send explicit probe traffic which traverses the data
    plane path in question. This probe traffic can also be used to
    measure jitter and delay.

 7. Security Management

    Providing a secure OAM environment does require that if MPLS 
    specific IP based tools are used, they can be filtered at the
    edge of the MPLS network. Malicious users cannot use non-MPLS 
    interfaces to insert MPLS specific OAM transactions, and provider
    initiated OAM transactions do not leak outside the MPLS cloud.

    OAM messaging does address existing security concerns with the 
    MPLS architecture. i.e. through rigorous defect handling operator's
    can offer their customers a greater degree of integrity protection 
    that their traffic will not be misdelivered (for example by being 
    able to detect leaking LSP traffic from a VPN).

    Support for inter-provider data plane OAM messaging introduces a
    number of security concerns as by definition, portions of LSPs will
    not be in trusted space, the provider has no control over who may
    inject traffic into the LSP which can be exploited for denial of
    service attacks. OAM PDUs are not explicitly identified in the MPLS
    header and therefore are not typically inspected by transit LSRs.
    This creates opportunity for malicious or poorly behaved users to
    disrupt network operations. Attempts to introduce filtering on
    target LSP OAM flows may be problematic if flows are not visible
    to intermediate LSRs. However it may be possible to interdict flows
    on the return path between providers (as faithfulness to the
    forwarding path is ot a return path requirement) to mitigate
    aspects of this vulnerability.

    OAM tools may permit unauthorized or malicious users to extract
    significant amounts of information about network configuration. This
    would be especially true of IP based tools as in many network
    configurations, MPLS does not typically extend to untrusted hosts,
    but IP does. For example, TTL hiding at ingress and egress LSRs will
    prevent external users from using TTL-based mechanisms to probe an
    operator's network. This suggests that tools used for problem
    diagnosis or which by design are capable of extracting significant
    amounts of information will require authentication and authorization
    of the originator. This may impact the scalability of such tools
    when employed for monitoring instead of diagnosis.
