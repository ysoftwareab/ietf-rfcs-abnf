               Test Cases for Evaluating RMCAT Proposals
                     draft-ietf-rmcat-eval-test-02

Abstract

   The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used to transmit media in
   multimedia telephony applications, these applications are typically
   required to implement congestion control.  The RMCAT working group is
   currently working on candidate algorithms for such interactive real-
   time multimedia applications.  This document describes the test cases
   to be used in the performance evaluation of those candidate
   algorithms.

1.  Introduction

   This memo describes a set of test cases for evaluating candidate
   RMCAT congestion control algorithm proposals, it is based on the
   guidelines enumerated in [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-criteria] and the
   requirements discussed in [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].  The test
   cases cover basic usage scenarios and are described using a common
   structure, which allows for additional test cases to be added to
   those described herein to accommodate other topologies and/or the
   modeling of different path characteristics.  It is the intention of
   this work to capture the consensus of the RMCAT working group

   participants regarding the test cases upon which the performance of
   the candidate RMCAT proposals should be evaluated.

2.  Terminology

   The terminology defined in RTP [RFC3550], RTP Profile for Audio and
   Video Conferences with Minimal Control [RFC3551], RTCP Extended
   Report (XR) [RFC3611], Extended RTP Profile for RTCP-based Feedback
   (RTP/AVPF) [RFC4585], and Support for Reduced-Size RTCP [RFC5506]
   apply.

3.  Structure of Test cases

   All test cases in this document follow a basic structure allowing
   implementers to describe a new test scenario without repeatedly
   explaining common attributes.  The structure includes a general
   description section that describes the test case and its motivation.
   Additionally the test case defines a set of attributes that
   characterize the testbed, i.e., the network path between
   communicating peers and the diverse traffic sources.

   o  Define the test case:

      *  General description: describes the motivation and the goals of
         the test case.

      *  Expected behavior: describe the desired rate adaptation
         behaviour.

      *  Define a check-list to evaluate the desired behaviour: this
         indicates the minimum set of metrics (e.g., link utilization,
         media sending rate) that a proposed algorithm needs to measure
         to validate the expected rate adaptation behaviour.  It should
         also indicate the time granularity (e.g., averaged over 10ms,
         100ms, or 1s) for measuring certain metrics.  Typical
         measurement interval is 200ms.

   o  Define testbed topology: every test case needs to define an
      evaluation testbed topology.  Figure 1 shows such an evaluation
      topology.  In this evaluation topology, S1..Sn are traffic
      sources.  These sources generate media traffic and use either an
      RMCAT candidate congestion control algorithm or other congestion
      control algorithm designed for media, such as TFRC.  R1..Rn are
      the corresponding receivers.  A test case can have one or more
      such traffic sources (S) and corresponding receivers (R).  The
      path from the source to destination is denoted as forward and the
      path from a destination to a source is denoted as backward.  The
      following basic structure of test case has been described from the

      perspective of media generating endpoints attached on the left-
      hand side of Figure 1.  In this setup, media flows in forward
      direction and corresponding feedback/control messages flow in the
      backward direction.  However, it is also possible to set up the
      test with media flowing in both forward and backward directions.
      In that case, unless otherwise specified by the test case, it is
      expected that the backward path does not introduce any congestion
      related impairments and has enough capacity to accommodate both
      media and feedback/control messages.  It should be noted that
      depending on the test cases it is possible to have different path
      characteristics in of the either directions.

                  Figure 1: Example of A Testbed Topology

      In a laboratory testbed environment there may exist a significant
      amount of traffic on portions of the network path between the
      endpoints that is not desired for the purposes of these RMCAT
      tests.  Some of this traffic may be generated by other processes
      on the endpoints themselves (e.g., discovery protocols) or by
      other endpoints not presently under test.  It is recommended not
      to route traffic generated by endpoints that are not under test
      through the test bed.  Additionally, it is recommended to route
      non-RMCAT traffic generated by the endpoints under test around the
      bottleneck links specified herein.

   o  Define testbed attributes:

      *  Duration: defines the duration of the test.

      *  Path characteristics: defines the end-to-end transport level
         path characteristics of the testbed in a particular test case.
         Two sets of attributes describe the path characteristics, one



Sarker, et al.           Expires March 11, 2016                 [Page 4]

         for the forward path and the other for the backward path.  The
         path characteristics for a particular path direction is
         applicable to all the Sources "S" sending traffic on that path.
         If only one attribute is specified, it is used for both path
         directions, however, unless specified the reverse path has no
         capacity restrictions and no path loss.

         +  Path direction: forward or backward.

         +  Bottleneck-link capacity: defines minimum capacity of the
            end-to-end path

         +  Reference bottleneck capacity: defines a reference value for
            the bottleneck capacity for test cases with time-varying
            bottleneck capacities.  All bottleneck capacities will be
            specified as a ratio with respect to the reference capacity
            value.

         +  One-way propagation delay: describes the end-to-end latency
            along the path when network queues are empty, i.e., the time
            it takes for a packet to go from the sender to the receiver
            without encountering any queuing delay.

         +  Maximum end-to-end jitter: defines the maximum jitter that
            can be observed along the path.

         +  Bottleneck queue type: for example, Droptail, FQ-CoDel, or
            PIE.

         +  Bottleneck queue size: defines size of queue in terms of
            queuing time when the queue is full (in milliseconds).

         +  Path loss ratio: characterizes the non-congested, additive,
            losses to be generated on the end-to-end path.  MUST
            describe the loss pattern or loss model used to generate the
            losses.

         +  Values for some characteristics are described in
            [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-criteria].

      *  Application-related: defines the traffic source behaviour for
         implementing the test case

         +  Media traffic Source: defines the characteristics of the
            media sources.  When using more than one media source, the
            different attributes are enumerated separately for each
            different media source.

            -  Media type: Video/Voice

            -  Media flow direction: forward, backward or both.

            -  Number of media sources: defines the total number of
               media sources

            -  Media codec: Constant Bit Rate (CBR) or Variable Bit Rate
               (VBR)

            -  Media source behaviour: describes the media encoder
               behavior.  It defines the main parameters that affect the
               adaptation behaviour.  This may include but not limited
               to:

               o  Adaptability: describes the adaptation options.  For
                  example, in the case of video it defines the following
                  ranges of adaptation: bit rate, frame rate, video
                  resolution.  Similarly, in the case of voice, it
                  defines the range of bit rate adaptation, the sampling
                  rate variation, and the variation in packetization
                  interval.

               o  Output variation : for a VBR encoder it defines the
                  encoder output variation from the average target rate
                  over a particular measurement interval.  For example,
                  on average the encoder output may vary between 5% to
                  15% above or below the average target bit rate when
                  measured over a 100 ms time window.  The time interval
                  over which the variation is specified must be
                  provided.

               o  Responsiveness to a new bit rate request: the lag in
                  time between a new bit rate request and actual rate
                  changes in encoder output.  Depending on the encoder,
                  this value may be specified in absolute time (e.g.
                  10ms to 1000ms) or other appropriate metric (next
                  frame interval time).

            -  Media content: describes the chosen media sequences; For
               example, test sequences are available at: [xiph-seq] and
               [HEVC-seq].

            -  Media timeline: describes the point when the media source
               is introduced and removed from the testbed.  For example,
               the media source may start transmitting immediately when
               the test case begins, or after a few seconds.

Internet-Draft          Test Scenarios for RMCAT          September 2015


            -  Startup behaviour: the media starts at a defined bit
               rate, which may be the minimum, maximum bit rate, or a
               value in between (in Kbps).

         +  Competing traffic source: describes the characteristics of
            the competing traffic source, the different types of
            competing flows are enumerated in
            [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-criteria].

            -  Traffic direction: forward, backward or both.

            -  Type of sources: defines the types of competing traffic
               sources.  Types of competing traffic flows are listed in
               [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-criteria].  For example, the number
               of TCP flows connected to a web browser, the mean size
               and distribution of the content downloaded.

            -  Number of sources: defines the total number of competing
               sources of each media type.

            -  Congestion control: enumerates the congestion control
               used by each type of competing traffic.

            -  Traffic timeline: describes when the competing traffic
               starts and ends in the test case.

      *  Additional attributes: describes attributes essential for
         implementing a test case which are not included in the above
         structure.  These attributes MUST be well defined, so that
         other implementers are able to implement it.

   Any attribute can have a set of values (enclosed within "[]").  Each
   member value of such a set MUST be treated as different value for the
   same attribute.  It is desired to run separate tests for each such
   attribute value.

   The test cases described in this document follow the above structure.

4.  Recommended Evaluation Settings

   This section describes recommended test case settings and could be
   overwritten by the respective test cases.

4.1.  Evaluation metircs

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the following metrics
   at a fine enough time granularity:



Sarker, et al.           Expires March 11, 2016                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          Test Scenarios for RMCAT          September 2015


   1.  Flow level:

       A.  End-to-end delay for the RMCAT flow.

       B.  Variation in sending bit rate and goodput.  Mainly observing
           the frequency and magnitude of oscillations.

       C.  Packet losses observed at the receiving endpoint

       D.  Feedback message overhead

       E.  Convergence time.

   2.  Transport level:

       A.  Bandwidth utilization

       B.  Queue length (milliseconds at specified path capacity):

           +  average over the length of the session

           +  5 and 95 percentile

           +  median, maximum, minimum

4.2.  Path characteristics

   Each path between a sender and receiver as described in Figure 1 have
   the following characteristics unless otherwise specified in the test
   case.

   o  Path direction: forward and backward.

   o  Reference bottleneck capacity: 1Mbps.

   o  One-Way propagation delay: 50ms.  Implementers are encouraged to
      run the experiment with additional propagation delays mentioned in
      [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-criteria]

   o  Maximum end-to-end jitter: 30ms.  Jitter models are described in
      [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-criteria]

   o  Bottleneck queue type: Drop tail.  Implementers are encouraged to
      run the experiment with other AQM schemes, such as FQ-CoDel and
      PIE.

   o  Bottleneck queue size: 300ms.

Internet-Draft          Test Scenarios for RMCAT          September 2015


   o  Path loss ratio: 0%.

   Examples of additional network parameters are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-criteria].

   For test cases involving time-varying bottleneck capacity, all
   capacity values are specified as a ratio with respect to a reference
   capacity value, so as to allow flexible scaling of capacity values
   along with media source rate range.  There exist two different
   mechanisms for inducing path capacity variation: a) by explicitly
   modifying the value of physical link capacity; or b) by introducing
   background non-adaptive UDP traffic with time-varying traffic rate.
   Implementers are encouraged run the experiments with both mechanisms
   for test cases specified in Section 5.1, Section 5.2, and
   Section 5.3.

4.3.  Media source

   Unless otherwise specified, each test case will include one or more
   media sources as described below.

   o  Media type: Video

      *  Media codec: VBR

      *  Media source behaviour:

         +  Adaptability:

            -  Bit rate range: 150 Kbps - 1.5 Mbps.  In real-life
               applications the bitrate range can vary a lot depending
               on the provided service, for example, the maximum bitrate
               can be up to 4Mbps.  However, for running tests to
               evaluate the congestion control algorithms it is more
               important to have a look at how they are reacting to
               certain amount of bandwidth change.  Also it is possible
               that the media traffic generator used in a particular
               simulator or testbed if not capable of generating higher
               bitrate.  Hence we have selected a suitable bitrate range
               typical of consumer-grade video conferencing applications
               in designing the test case.  If a different bitrate range
               is used in the test cases, the end-to-end path capacity
               values will also need to be scaled accordingly.

5.  Basic Test Cases

5.1.  Variable Available Capacity with Single RMCAT flow

   In this test case the bottleneck-link capacity between the two
   endpoints varies over time.  This test is designed to measure the
   responsiveness of the candidate algorithm.  This test tries to
   address the requirements in [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements], which
   requires the algorithm to adapt the flow(s) and provide lower end-to-
   end latency when there exists:

   o  an intermediate bottleneck

   o  change in available capacity (e.g., due to interface change,
      routing change, abrupt arrival/departure of background non-
      adaptive traffic).

   o  maximum Media Bit Rate is Greater than Link Capacity.  In this
      case, the application will attempt to ramp up to its maximum bit
      rate, since the link capacity is limited to a value lower, the
      congestion control scheme is expected to stabilize the sending bit
      rate close to the available bottleneck capacity.  This situation
      can occur when the endpoints are connected via thin long networks
      even though the advertised capacity of the access network may be
      higher.

Internet-Draft          Test Scenarios for RMCAT          September 2015


   It should be noted that the exact variation in available capacity due
   to any of the above depends on the under-lying technologies.  Hence,
   we describe a set of known factors, which may be extended to devise a
   more specific test case targeting certain behaviour in a certain
   network environment.

   Expected behavior: the candidate algorithm is expected to detect the
   path capacity constraint, converges to bottleneck link's capacity and
   adapt the flow to avoid unwanted oscillation when the sending bit
   rate is approaching the bottleneck link's capacity.  The oscillations
   occur when the media flow(s) attempts to reach its maximum bit rate,
   overshoots the usage of the available bottleneck capacity, to rectify
   it reduces the bit rate and starts to ramp up again.

   Testbed topology: One media source S1 is connected to corresponding
   R1.  The media traffic is transported over the forward path and
   corresponding feedback/control traffic is transported over the
   backward path.

5.2.  Variable Available Capacity with Multiple RMCAT flows

   This test case is similar to Section 5.1.  However in addition this
   test will also consider persistent network load due to competing
   traffic.

   Expected behavior: the candidate algorithms is expected to detect the
   variation in available capacity and adapt the media stream(s)
   accordingly.  The flows stabilize around their maximum bitrate as the
   as the maximum link capacity is large enough to accommodate the
   flows.  When the available capacity drops, the flow(s) adapts by
   decreasing its sending bit rate, and when congestion disappears, the
   flow(s) are again expected to ramp up.

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the metrics described
   in Section 4.1 at a fine enough time granularity:

   Testbed Topology: Two (2) media sources S1 and S2 are connected to
   their corresponding destinations R1 and R2.  The media traffic is
   transported over the forward path and corresponding feedback/control
   traffic is transported over the backward path.

5.3.  Congested Feedback Link with Bi-directional RMCAT flows

   RMCAT WG has been chartered to define algorithms for RTP hence it is
   assumed that RTCP, RTP header extension or such would be used by the
   congestion control algorithm in the backchannel.  Due to asymmetric
   nature of the link between communicating peers it is possible for a
   participating peer to not receive such feedback information due to an
   impaired or congested backchannel (even when the forward channel
   might not be impaired).  This test case is designed to observe the
   candidate congestion control behaviour in such an event.

   It is expected that the candidate algorithms is able to cope with the
   lack of feedback information and adapt to minimize the performance
   degradation of media flows in the forward channel.

   It should be noted that for this test case: logs are compared with
   the reference case, i.e, when the backward channel has no impairments

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the metrics described
   in Section 4.1 at a fine-grained time intervals:

   Testbed topology: One (1) media source S1 is connected to
   corresponding R1, but both endpoints are additionally receiving and
   sending data, respectively.  The media traffic (S1->R1) is
   transported over the forward path and corresponding feedback/control
   traffic is transported over the backward path.  Likewise media
   traffic (S2->R2) is transported over the backward path and
   corresponding feedback/control traffic is transported over the
   forward path.

5.4.  Competing Flows with Same RMCAT Algorithm

   In this test case, more than one RMCAT media flow shares the
   bottleneck link and each of them uses the same congestion control
   algorithm.  This is a typical scenario where a real-time interactive
   application sends more than one media flows to the same destination
   and these flows are multiplexed over the same port.  In such a



Sarker, et al.           Expires March 11, 2016                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft          Test Scenarios for RMCAT          September 2015


   scenario it is likely that the flows will be routed via the same path
   and need to share the available bandwidth amongst themselves.  For
   the sake of simplicity it is assumed that there are no other non-
   RMCAT competing traffic sources in the bottleneck link and that there
   is sufficient capacity to accommodate all the flows individually.
   While this appears to be a variant of the test case defined in
   Section 5.2, it focuses on the capacity sharing aspect of the
   candidate algorithm.  The previous test case, on the other hand,
   measures adaptability, stability, and responsiveness of the candidate
   algorithm.

   Expected behavior: It is expected that the competing flows will
   converge to an optimum bit rate to accommodate all the flows with
   minimum possible latency and loss.  Specifically, the test introduces
   three media flows at different time instances, when the second flow
   appears there should still be room to accommodate another flow on the
   bottleneck link.  Lastly, when the third flow appears the bottleneck
   link should be saturated.

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the metrics described
   in Section 4.1 at a fine enough time granularity:

   Testbed topology: Three media sources S1, S2, S3 are connected to
   respective R1, R2, R3.  The media traffic is transported over the
   forward path and corresponding feedback/control traffic is
   transported over the backward path.

5.5.  Round Trip Time Fairness

   In this test case, multiple RMCAT media flows share the bottleneck
   link, but the end-to-end path latency for each RMCAT flow is
   different.  For the sake of simplicity it is assumed that there are
   no other non-RMCAT competing traffic sources in the bottleneck link
   and that there is sufficient capacity to accommodate all the flows.
   While this appears to be a variant of test case 5.2, it focuses on
   the capacity sharing aspect of the candidate algorithm under
   different RTTs.

   It is expected that the competing flows will converge to bit rates to
   accommodate all the flows with minimum possible latency and loss.
   Specifically, the test introduces five media flows at the same time
   instance.

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the metrics described
   in Section 4.1 at a fine enough time granularity:

   Testbed Topology: Five (5) media sources S1,S2,..,S5 are connected to
   their corresponding media sinks R1,R2,..,R5.  The media traffic is
   transported over the forward path and corresponding feedback/control
   traffic is transported over the backward path.  The topology is the
   same as in Section 5.4.  The end-to-end path delays are: 10ms for
   S1-R1, 25ms for S2-R2, 50ms for S3-R3, 100ms for S4-R4, and 150ms
   S5-R5, respectively.

   Testbed attributes:

   o  Test duration: 300s

   o  Path characteristics:

      *  One-Way propagation delay for each flow: 10ms, 25ms, 50ms,

5.6.  RMCAT Flow competing with a long TCP Flow

   In this test case, one or more RMCAT media flows share the bottleneck
   link with at least one long lived TCP flows.  Long lived TCP flows
   download data throughout the session and are expected to have
   infinite amount of data to send and receive.  This is a scenario
   where a multimedia application co-exists with a large file download.
   The test case measures the adaptivity of the candidate algorithm to
   competing traffic.  It addresses the requirement 3 in
   [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].

   Expected behavior: depending on the convergence observed in test case
   5.1 and 5.2, the candidate algorithm may be able to avoid congestion
   collapse.  In the worst case, the media stream will fall to the
   minimum media bit rate.

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the following metrics
   in addition to the metrics described in Section 4.1 at a fine enough
   time granularity:

   1.  Flow level:

       A.  TCP throughput.

   Testbed topology: One (1) media source S1 is connected to
   corresponding media sink, R1.  In addition, there is a long-live TCP
   flow sharing the same bottleneck link.  The media traffic is
   transported over the forward path and corresponding feedback/control
   traffic is transported over the backward path.  The TCP traffic goes
   over the forward path from, S_tcp with acknowledgement packets
   flowing along the backward path from, R_tcp.

5.7.  RMCAT Flow competing with short TCP Flows

   In this test case, one or more RMCAT media flow shares the bottleneck
   link with multiple short-lived TCP flows.  Short-lived TCP flows
   resemble the on/off pattern observed in the web traffic, wherein
   clients (browsers) connect to a server and download a resource
   (typically a web page, few images, text files, etc.) using several
   TCP connections (up to 4).  This scenario shows the performance of
   the multimedia application when several browser windows are active.
   The test case measures the adaptivity of the candidate algorithm to
   competing web traffic, it addresses the requirements 1.E in
   [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].

   Depending on the number of short TCP flows, the cross-traffic either
   appears as a short burst flow or resembles a long TCP flow.  The
   intention of this test is to observe the impact of short-term burst
   on the behaviour of the candidate algorithm.

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the following metrics
   in addition to the metrics described in Section 4.1 at a fine enough
   time granularity:

   1.  Flow level:

       A.  Variation in the sending rate of the TCP flow.

       B.  TCP throughput.

   Testbed topology: The topology described here is same as the one
   described in Figure 6.

   Testbed attributes:

   o  Test duration: 300s

            sequence of file downloads interleaved with idle periods.
            See test specific setup.  Not all short TCPs start at the
            same time, 2 start in the ON state while 8 start in an OFF
            stats.  The model for the idle times for the OFF state is

5.8.  Media Pause and Resume

   In this test case, more than one real-time interactive media flows
   share the link bandwidth and all flows reach to a steady state by
   utilizing the link capacity in an optimum way.  At these stage one of
   the media flow is paused for a moment.  This event will result in
   more available bandwidth for the rest of the flows and as they are on
   a shared link.  When the paused media flow will resume it would no
   longer have the same bandwidth share on the link.  It has to make
   it's way through the other existing flows in the link to achieve a
   fair share of the link capacity.  This test case is important
   specially for real-time interactive media which consists of more than
   one media flows and can pause/resume media flow at any point of time
   during the session.  This test case directly addresses the
   requirement number 5 in [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].  One can
   think it as a variation of test case defined in Section 5.4.
   However, it is different as the candidate algorithms can use
   different strategies to increase its efficiency, for example the
   fairness, convergence time, reduce oscillation etc, by capitalizing
   the fact that they have previous information of the link.

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the following metrics
   in addition to the metrics described in Section 4.1 at a fine enough
   time granularity:

   1.  Flow level:

       A.  Variation in sending bit rate and goodput.  Mainly observing
           the frequency and magnitude of oscillations.

6.  Other potential test cases

   It has been noticed that there are other interesting test cases
   besides the basis test cases listed above.  In many aspects, these
   additional test cases can help to further evaluate the candidate
   algorithm.  They are listed as below.

6.1.  Explicit Congestion Notification Usage

   This test case requires to run all the basic test cases with the
   availability of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) [RFC6679]
   feature enabled.  The goal of this test is to exhibit that the
   candidate algorithms does not fail when ECN signals are available.
   With ECN signals enabled the algorithms are expected to perform
   better than their delay based variants.

6.2.  Multiple Bottlenecks

   In this test case one RMCAT flow, S1->R2 traverse a path with
   multiple bottlenecks.  As illustrated in Figure 7, the first flow
   (S1->R1) competes with the second RMCAT flow (S2->R2) over the link
   between A and B which is close to the sender side; again, that flow

Internet-Draft          Test Scenarios for RMCAT          September 2015


   (S1->R1) competes with the third RMCAT flow (S3->R3) over the link
   between C and D which is close to the receiver side.  The goal of
   this test is to ensure that the candidate algorithms work properly in
   the presence of multiple bottleneck links on the end to end path.

   Expected behavior: the candidate algorithm is expected to achieve
   full utilization at both bottleneck links without starving any of the
   three RMCAT flows.
