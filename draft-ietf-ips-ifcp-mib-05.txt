Abstract

   The iFCP protocol provides Fibre Channel fabric functionality on an
   IP network in which TCP/IP switching and routing elements replace
   Fibre Channel components.  The iFCP protocol is used between iFCP
   Gateways.  This draft provides a mechanism to monitor and control
   iFCP Gateway instances, and their associated sessions, using SNMP.

   This memo is a product of the IP Storage (IPS) working group within
   the Internet Engineering Task Force.  Comments are solicited and
   should be addressed to the working group's mailing list at
   ips@ece.cmu.edu and/or the authors.

1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7
   of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
   termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are
   generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol
   (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms
   defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This
   memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which
   is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579
   [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

2.  Introduction

   The iFCP protocol can be used by FC to IP based storage gateways
   for FCP storage interconnects.  Figure 1 provides an example
   interconnect between iFCP gateways.

   The iFCP MIB is designed to allow SNMP to be used to monitor and
   manage local iFCP gateway instances, including the configuration of
   iFCP sessions between gateways.

3.  Technical Description

   Internet Draft              iFCP MIB                     March 2003

   The MIB is divided into sections for iFCP local gateway instance
   management, iFCP session management, and iFCP session statistics.

   The section for iFCP gateway management provides default settings
   and information about each local instance.  A single management
   entity can monitor multiple local gateway instances.  Each local
   gateway is conceptually an independent gateway that has both Fibre
   Channel and IP interfaces.  Other standard MIBs, such as the Fibre
   Management MIB [FCMGT01], the Interfaces Group MIB [RFC2863] and
   MIB II [RFC1213] can be used to manage non-iFCP specific gateway
   parameters.  The local gateway instance section provides iFCP
   specific information as well as optional links to other standard
   management MIBs.

   The iFCP session management section provides information on iFCP
   sessions that are using one of the local iFCP gateway instances.
   This section allows the management of specific iFCP parameters.

   The iFCP session statistics section provides statistical
   information on the iFCP sessions that are using one of the local
   iFCP gateways.  These tables augment the session management table.
   Additional statistical information for an iFCP gateway or session,
   that is not iFCP specific, can be obtained using other standard
   MIBs.  The iFCP statistics are provided in both standard and low-
   capacity (counter32) methods.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   Changing the following object values, with a MAX-ACCESS of read-
   write, may cause disruption in storage traffic:
        ifcpLclGtwyInstAddrTransMode
        ifcpLclGtwyInstFcBrdcstSupport
        ifcpLclGtwyInstDefaultIpTOV
        ifcpLclGtwyInstDefaultLTInterval
        ifcpSessionIpTOV

   Internet Draft              iFCP MIB                     March 2003


   Changing the following object value, with a MAX-ACCESS of read-
   write, may cause a user to lose track of the iFCP gateway:
        ifcpLclGtwyInstDescr

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with
   a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive
   or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important
   to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending
   them over the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   The following object tables provide information about storage
   traffic sessions, and can indicate to a user who is communicating
   and exchanging storage data:
        ifcpLclGtwyInstTable
        ifcpSessionAttributesTable

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the
   objects in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features
   as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access
   to the objects only to those principals (users) that have
   legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
