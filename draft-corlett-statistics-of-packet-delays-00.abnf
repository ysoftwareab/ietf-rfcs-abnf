nu = {8*P*L / C*rho)

C = 1.5x10^6 bps is the T1 link bandwidth and rho is the utilization. In Table 1
T= 300 m/M_r , where  T  is the time separation and 300/M_r  the (constant) packet
T = N Delta t  is the total length of the (concatenated) dataset and " ^* "
omega_k = 10^{-5}-10^{-4}  secs^{-1} , followed by noise at higher frequencies.
