Internet-Draft     The APEX Publish-Subscribe Service     September 2001


1. Introduction

   Multicast is a form of one-to-many distribution of datagrams.  Its
   perceived strength relies on the "network" (in whatever form it is
   realized), rather than the source, replicating traffic to the
   different receivers of a group.  The replication topology is a tree
   of nodes overlayed on top of a physical network.  Traditionally,
   multicast has been viewed as a network layer service in which
   replication is done by routers.

   Multicast APEX (MAPEX) [1] is a one-to-many type of distribution of
   information through an APEX [2] "relay mesh".  Such a mechanism
   could, for example, allow implementation of a messaging "exploder"
   that performs a single store-and-forward delivery of a group-
   addressed message across a trans-oceanic link, after which point
   messages are delivered to multiple recipients on the remote side of
   the link.

   MAPEX does not rely on the presence of IP layer multicast [3].
   Instead, MAPEX represents a form of application-level multicast, a
   distinction we make because the datagram service uses APEX relays as
   replication points.  The APEX relaying mesh uses BEEP [4], which in
   turn runs on top of TCP [5].  This last point allows MAPEX to adapt
   to congestion in a fashion that is TCP-friendly.

   One could conceive of a scenario in which IP multicast is used at the
   edges of the MAPEX tree -- connecting subscribers to a MAPEX end-
   point (i.e., a leaf or edge of the MAPEX tree).  One could also
   conceive of some form of reliable IP multicast [6] being used between
   MAPEX relay nodes.  However, these represent possibilities outside
   the scope of the current document.

   The specific manner in which the MAPEX distribution tree is
   provisioned over an APEX relaying mesh is also outside the scope of
   the current document.  Instead, we describe a publish-subscribe
   service built atop APEX, which can be deployed using static tree
   configuration, and possibly later augmented with a protocol for
   automating tree configuration.  The pubsub service is used to manage
   subscriber lists for a set of topical distribution groups, and to
   forward messages to group subscribers.  In this sense, the pubsub
   service is a simply an APEX-based application making use of the
   provisioning optimizations afforded by MAPEX.

   APEX, at its core, provides a best-effort datagram service.  Within
   an administrative domain, all relays must be able to handle messages
   for any endpoint within that domain.  APEX services are logically
   defined as endpoints but given their ubiquitous semantics they do not
   necessarily need to be associated with a single physical endpoint.
   As such, they may be provisioned co-resident with each relay within
   an administrative domain, even though they are logically provided on
   top of the relaying mesh, i.e.,

      +----------+     +----------+    +----------+    +---------+
      |   APEX   |     |   APEX   |    |   APEX   |    |         |
      |  access  |     |  pubsub  |    | presence |    |   ...   |
      |  service |     |  service |    |  service |    |         |
      +----------+     +----------+    +----------+    +---------+
           |                |               |               |
           |                |               |               |
   +----------------------------------------------------------------+
   |                                                                |
   |                            APEX core                           |
   |                                                                |
   +----------------------------------------------------------------+

   That is, applications communicate with an APEX service by exchanging
   data with a "well-known endpoint" (WKE).

   APEX applications communicate with the pubsub service by exchanging
   data with the well-known endpoint "apex=pubsub" in the corresponding
   administrative domain, e.g., "apex=pubsub@example.com" is the
   endpoint associated with the pubsub service in the "example.com"
   administrative domain.

   Note that within a single administrative domain, the pubsub service
   makes use of the APEX access [7] service to determine whether an
   originator is allowed to manage topic and subscription information,
   and whether an originator is allowed to publish to a given topic.

2. Topic and Subscription Management

   The APEX pubsub service manages a list of named topics and a list of
   subscribers for each topic, and implements delivery for group-
   addressed messages using the underlying APEX relay service.

   The pubsub service uses hierarchical topic names similar to NNTP [8]
   group names.  Unlike NNTP's global newsgroup namespace, the pubsub
   service defines a distinct topic name space per administrative
   domain.  The allocation of the topic name space, including any
   conventions applied at particular levels in the hierarchy, is an
   issue for each local administrative domain.  Each administrative
   domain is also responsible for setting access control policy for
   pubsub operations, and for maintaining state on stable storage about
   the currently existing set of topics and subscribers for each topic.

   Each of the topic and subscription management operations is described
   in the subsections below.

2.1 Defining a New Topic

   When an application wants to define a new topic to which group-
   delivery messages can be addressed, it sends a createtopic operation
   to the service, e.g.,

       +-------+                  +-------+
       |       | -- data -------> |       |
       | appl. |                  | relay |
       |       | <--------- ok -- |       |
       +-------+                  +-------+

       C: <data content='#Content'>
              <originator identity='mike@example.com' />
              <recipient identity='apex=pubsub@example.com' />
              <data-content Name='Content'>
                  <createtopic topic='music.jazz.milesdavis'
                               transID='1' />
              </data-content>
          </data>
       S: <ok />

   The service immediately responds with a reply operation containing
   the same transaction-identifier, e.g.,

                                  +-------+                  +-------+
                                  |       | <------- data -- |       |
                                  | relay |                  | pubsub|
                                  |       | -- ok ---------> |  svc. |
                                  +-------+                  +-------+

     C: <data content='#Content'>
            <originator identity='apex=pubsub@example.com' />
            <recipient identity='mike@example.com' />
            <data-content Name='Content'>
                <reply code='250' transID='1' />
            </data-content>
        </data>
     S: <ok />

2.2 Deleting an Existing Topic

   When an application wants to delete an existing topic, it sends a
   deletetopic operation to the service, e.g.,

       +-------+                  +-------+
       |       | -- data -------> |       |
       | appl. |                  | relay |
       |       | <--------- ok -- |       |
       +-------+                  +-------+

       C: <data content='#Content'>
              <originator identity='mike@example.com' />
              <recipient identity='apex=pubsub@example.com' />
              <data-content Name='Content'>
                  <deletetopic topic='music.jazz.milesdavis'
                               transID='2' />
              </data-content>
          </data>
       S: <ok />

   The service immediately responds with a reply operation containing
   the same transaction-identifier, e.g.,

                                  +-------+                  +-------+
                                  |       | <------- data -- |       |
                                  | relay |                  | pubsub|
                                  |       | -- ok ---------> |  svc. |
                                  +-------+                  +-------+

     C: <data content='#Content'>
            <originator identity='apex=pubsub@example.com' />
            <recipient identity='mike@example.com' />
            <data-content Name='Content'>
                <reply code='250' transID='2' />
            </data-content>
        </data>

2.3 Listing Existing Topics

   When an application wants to get a list of existing topics, it sends
   a listtopics operation to the service, e.g.,

       +-------+                  +-------+
       |       | -- data -------> |       |
       | appl. |                  | relay |
       |       | <--------- ok -- |       |
       +-------+                  +-------+

       C: <data content='#Content'>
              <originator identity='mike@example.com' />
              <recipient identity='apex=pubsub@example.com' />
              <data-content Name='Content'>
                  <listtopics />
              </data-content>
          </data>
       S: <ok />

   The service immediately responds with a topiclist operation
   containing the list of topics registered with its administrative
   domain, e.g.,

                                  +-------+                  +-------+
                                  |       | <------- data -- |       |
                                  | relay |                  | pubsub|

2.4 Subscribing to a Topic

   When an application wants to subscribe to a topic it sends a
   subscribe operation to the service, e.g.,

       +-------+                  +-------+
       |       | -- data -------> |       |
       | appl. |                  | relay |
       |       | <--------- ok -- |       |

                <subscribe subscriber='mike@example.com'
                           topic='music.jazz.milesdavis'
                           duration='9999999'
                           transID='3' />
            </data-content>
        </data>

2.6 Distributing Subscription Management

   Servicing publish/subscribe activity from a single location would
   present scaling problems.  To support administratively distributed
   subscriber  management, individual administrative domains can field
   pubsub servers that send subscribe and cancel requests to other
   pubsub servers.  In this fashion, it is possible to construct a
   distributed tree of servers that handle publish and subscribe
   activity.  Whether this set of servers is configured manually or
   through an automated tree formation protocol is outside the scope of
   the current document.

   When a pubsub server wants to act as a distributor for a particular
   topic it sends a subscribe operation to the service, using the
   appropriate subaddress as the originator, e.g.,

       +-------+                  +-------+
       | pubsub| -- data -------> |       |
       |  svc. |                  | relay |
       |   #2  | <--------- ok -- |       |
       +-------+                  +-------+

     C: <data content='#Content'>
            <originator
             identity='apex=pubsub/music.jazz.milesdavis@redistr.com' />
            <recipient identity='apex=pubsub@example.com' />
            <data-content Name='Content'>
            <subscribe
                subscriber=
                    'apex=pubsub/music.jazz.milesdavis@redistr.com'
                topic='music.jazz.milesdavis'
                duration='9999999'
                transID='5' />
            </data-content>
        </data>
     S: <ok />

Internet-Draft     The APEX Publish-Subscribe Service     September 2001


   The service immediately responds with a reply operation containing
   the same transaction-identifier, e.g.,

                                  +-------+                  +-------+
                                  |       | <------- data -- | pubsub|
                                  | relay |                  |  svc. |
                                  |       | -- ok ---------> |   #1  |
                                  +-------+                  +-------+

     C: <data content='#Content'>
            <originator identity='apex=pubsub@example.com' />
            <recipient
             identity='apex=pubsub/music.jazz.milesdavis@redistr.com' />
            <data-content Name='Content'>
                <reply code='250' transID='5' />
            </data-content>
        </data>
     S: <ok />

   Similarly, a pubsub server would send a cancel request using the
   appropriate subaddress as the originator.

   Additional processing steps are needed to handle the case where
   pubsub servers themselves may originate subscribe and cancel
   requests.  Specifically, when any subscribe or cancel request is
   received, the receiving server must first check whether the
   originator falls within the administrative domain of a redistributing
   pubsub server for the given topic, and if so, the subscribe or cancel
   request is forwarded to that pubsub server.  Section 4.5 and Section
   4.6 present the algorithmic details.

   It is a local provisioning decision whether a redistributing pubsub
   server advertises its presence to end users.

3. Publishing

   To publish a message to subscribers of a particular topic, an
   application sends an APEX data message to the service, using
   subaddressing to specify the topic for which group delivery is
   desired, e.g.,

       +-------+                  +-------+
       |       | -- data -------> |       |
       | appl. |                  | relay |

   In response, the service forwards the message content to each
   subscriber of the subaddress-named topic, rewriting the message to
   contain a list of recipients so that the APEX core will relay the
   message to each subscriber in turn:

   This subaddress-based topic naming is used rather than defining an
   explicit "publish" operation so that sending and receiving
   applications need not be aware that they are participating in group
   delivery transmissions.  The placement of multiple subscribers within
   a pubsub message realizes the benefit of a single message being
   replicated N times by the APEX relay mesh, versus the transmission of
   N messages by the publisher (source) to the relay mesh.

4. The Pubsub Service

   Section 5.1 contains the APEX service registration for the pubsub
   service:

   o  Within an administrative domain, the service is addressed using
      the well-known endpoint of "apex=pubsub", or a subaddress of this
      well-known endpoint.  Consult Section 2.2 of [2] for a discussion
      of APEX subaddresses.

   o  Section 6.1 defines the syntax of the operations exchanged with
      the service.

   o  A consumer of the service initiates communications by sending data
      containing the createtopic, deletetopic, subscribe, or cancel
      operation to the "apex=pubsub" well-known endpoint; or by sending
      any data to a subaddress of this well-known endpoint.

   o  In addition to replying to these operations, the service may also
      initiate communications by sending data containing the cancel
      operation or by forwarding data previously sent to a subaddress of
      the "apex=pubsub" well-known endpoint.

   An implementation of the service must maintain information about in-
   progress operations in persistent storage.

   Consult Section 6.1.1 of [2] for a discussion on the properties of
   long-lived transaction-identifiers.

4.1 Use of XML and MIME

   Section 4.1 of [2] describes how arbitrary MIME content is exchanged
   as a BEEP [4] payload.  For example, to transmit:

       <data content='...'>
           <originator identity='mike@example.com' />
           <recipient
            identity='apex=pubsub/music.jazz.milesdavis@example.com' />
       </data>

   where "..." refers to: <FavoriteAlbum title="Kind of Blue" />

   then the corresponding BEEP message might look like this:

       MSG 1 1 . 42 1234
       Content-Type: multipart/related; boundary="boundary";
                     start="<1@example.com>";
                     type="application/beep+xml"

       --boundary
       Content-Type: application/beep+xml
       Content-ID: <1@example.com>

       <data content='cid:2@example.com'>

           <recipient
            identity='apex=pubsub/music.jazz.milesdavis@example.com' />
       </data>
       --boundary
       Content-Type: application/beep+xml
       Content-ID: <2@example.com>

4.2 The Createtopic Operation

   When an application wants to create a new topic to which subscribe
   operations and data transmissions can refer, it sends a "createtopic"
   element to the service.

   The "createtopic" element has a "topic" attribute, a "transID"
   attribute, and no content:

   o  the "topic" attribute specifies the topic name for which this
      application wishes to allow future subscribe operations and data
      transmissions to be supported; and,

   o  the "transID" attribute specifies the transaction-identifier
      associated with this operation.

   When the service receives a "createtopic" element, the service
   performs these steps:

   1.  If the access entry for the service matching the originator does
       not contain a "pubsub:createtopic" token, a "reply" element
       having code 537 is sent to the originator.

   2.  If the "topic" attribute specifies a topic name that already
       exists, a "reply" element having code 553 is sent to the
       originator.

   3.  Otherwise:

       1.  The service records the topic in its non-volatile state, to
           enable future subscribe operations and data transmissions
           refering to this new topic.

       2.  A "reply" element having code 250 is immediately sent to the
           originator.

   When sending the "reply" element, the "transID" attribute is
   identical to the value found in the "createtopic" element sent by the
   originator.

4.3 The Deletetopic Operation

   When an application wants to delete an existing topic (i.e., one for
   which a previous createtopic operation completed successfully), it
   sends a "deletetopic" element to the service.

   The "deletetopic" element has a "topic" attribute, a "transID"
   attribute, and no content:

Internet-Draft     The APEX Publish-Subscribe Service     September 2001


   o  the "topic" attribute specifies the topic name for which this
      application wishes to disable future subscribe operations and data
      transmissions; and,

   o  the "transID" attribute specifies the transaction-identifier
      associated with this operation.

   When the service receives a "deletetopic" element, the service
   performs these steps:

   1.  If the access entry for the service matching the originator does
       not contain a "pubsub:deletetopic" token, a "reply" element
       having code 537 is sent to the originator.

   2.  If the "topic" attribute specifies a topic name that does not
       currently exist, a "reply" element having code 553 is sent to the
       originator.

   3.  Otherwise:

       1.  The service deletes the topic from its non-volatile state, to
           disable future subscribe operations and data transmissions
           refering to this topic.

       2.  A "reply" element having code 250 is immediately sent to the
           originator.

   When sending the "reply" element, the "transID" attribute is
   identical to the value found in the "deletetopic" element sent by the
   originator.

   Note that following a deletetopic operation, data transmissions
   refering to this topic may continue to be propagated.  Although the
   service will all no new data transmissions to start refering to this
   topic, in-progress data transmissions may be in transit.

4.4 The Listtopics Operation

   When an application wants to get a list of existing topics, it sends
   a "listtopics" element to the service.

   The "listtopics" element has no content.

   When the service receives a "listtopics" element, the service
   performs these steps:

   1.  If the access entry for the service matching the originator does
       not contain a "pubsub:listtopics" token, a "reply" element having
       code 537 is sent to the originator.

   2.  Otherwise, a "topiclist" element is immediately sent to the
       originator, having the same "transID" attribute value", and
       containing a sequence of "topic" elements each with a single
       "name" attribute, enumerating the topics known in this
       administrative domain.


4.5 The Subscribe Operation

   When an application wants to receive forwarded messages sent to the
   service via the data transmissions sent to a particular topic
   (subaddress) at a domain, it sends a "subscribe" element to the
   service.

   The "subscribe" element has a "subscriber" attribute, a "topic"
   attribute, a "transID" attribute, a "duration" attribute, and no
   content:

   o  the "subscriber" attribute specifies the endpoint to which data
      transmissions should be forwarded;

   o  the "topic" attribute specifies the topic name for which this
      application wishes to have corresponding data transmissions
      forwarded;

   o  the "duration" attribute specifies a non-zero maximum number of
      seconds for which the subscriber is interested in receiving
      forwarded data transmissions; and,

   o  the "transID" attribute specifies the transaction-identifier
      associated with this operation.

   When the service receives a "subscribe" element, we refer to the
   "subscriber" attribute of the "subscribe" element as the "subject",
   and the service performs these steps:

   1.  If the access entry for the service matching the originator does
       not contain a "pubsub:subscribe" token, a "reply" element having
       code 537 is sent to the originator.

   2.  If the "topic" attribute specifies a topic name that does not
       exist, a "reply" element having code 553 is sent to the
       originator.

   3.  If the duration attribute is less than or equal to zero, a
       "reply" element having code 553 is sent to the originator.

   4.  If the topic already has a subscriber whose local-part is
       "apex=pubsub/TOPIC" (where "TOPIC" matches the value of the
       "topic" attribute), and whose domain-part matches the domain-part
       of the subject, then the service forwards the "subscribe" element
       to the existing subscriber.

   5.  Otherwise:

       1.  A "reply" element having code 250 is sent to the originator.

       2.  For up to the amount of time indicated by the "duration"
           attribute of the "subscribe" element, if a data transmission
           is sent to the service with a subaddress matching the
           specified topic, it is forwarded to the subject.  (If the
           subject is already subscribed, the previous duration is no
           longer consulted.) Finally, when the amount of time indicated
           by the "duration" attribute expires, a cancel operation
           (Section 4.6) is sent to the originator.

   When sending the "reply" element, the "transID" attribute is
   identical to the value found in the "subscribe" element sent by the
   originator.

4.6 The Cancel Operation

   When an application no longer wishes to subscribe to a particular
   topic, it sends an "cancel" element to the service; similarly, when
   the service no longer considers an application to be subscribing, an
   "cancel" element is sent to the application.

Internet-Draft     The APEX Publish-Subscribe Service     September 2001


   The "cancel" element has a "subscriber" attribute, a "topic"
   attribute, a "transID" attribute, and no content:

   o  the "subscriber" attribute specifies the endpoint to which data
      transmissions should no longer be forwarded;

   o  the "topic" attribute specifies the topic name for which this
      application wishes to cease having corresponding subscribed data
      transmissions forwarded; and,

   o  the "transID" attribute specifies the transaction-identifier
      associated with this operation.

   When the service receives an "cancel" element, we refer to the
   "subscriber" attribute of the "subscribe" element as the "subject",
   and the service performs these steps:

   1.  If the access entry for the service matching the originator does
       not contain a "pubsub:cancel" token, a "reply" element having
       code 537 is sent to the originator.

   2.  If the "topic" attribute specifies a topic name that does not
       exist, a "reply" element having code 553 is sent to the
       originator.

   3.  If the topic already has a subscriber whose local-part is
       "apex=pubsub/TOPIC" (where "TOPIC" matches the value of the
       "topic" attribute), and whose domain-part matches the domain-part
       of the subject, then the service forwards the "cancel" element to
       the existing subscriber.

   4.  Otherwise:

       1.  A "reply" element having code 250 is sent to the originator.

       2.  The service removes the subject from the list of endpoints to
           which data is forwarded for the topic.

   When sending the "reply" element, the "transID" attribute is
   identical to the value found in the "subscribe" element sent by the
   originator.

   Note that following a cancel operation, the originator may receive
   further data transmissions directed to the specified topic.  Although
   the service will forward no new data after processing a cancel
   operation and sending the reply operation, earlier transmissions may
   be in transit.

4.7 Data Transmissions

4.7.1 Use of APEX Data Messages

   When an application wants to transmit information to other
   applications subscribed to a particular topic within an
   administrative domain, it sends data to the apex=pubsub service at
   the given administrative domain using the APEX "data" operation, with
   the subaddress set to the desired topic.  When the service receives a
   data operation so addressed, it performs the following steps:

   1.  If the subaddress does not match an existing topic at this
       administrative domain, then when the APEX core delivers the data
       to the pubsub service (Step 5.3 of Section 4.4.4.1 of [2]), the
       pubsub service returns an "error" element having code 550.

   2.  Otherwise, the pubsub service returns an "ok" element, and then
       submits a new data element to the relay service, replacing the
       recipient with a set of recipients enumerating each endpoint that
       had previously successfully performed a "subscribe" operation
       specifying a topic name that matches the subaddress and for which
       the "subscribe" operation is still active (i.e., its specified
       duration has not been exceeded).


4.7.2 The dataHopping Option

   To detect misconfigurations that cause forwarding loops in the APEX
   relaying mesh, the APEX pubsub service re-introduces a mechanism
   similar to the IP TTL [9] mechanism, in the form of an APEX option.
   Section 5.2 contains the APEX option registration for the
   "dataHopping" option.

   If this option is present in the "data" operation (c.f., Section
   4.4.4 of [2]) and the value of the "noMoreThan" attribute is non-
   zero, then:

   o  For Step 5.2 of Section 4.4.4.1 of [2]:

      Immediately prior to sending the data to the next relay, the value
      of the "noMoreThan" attribute is reduced by 1.

      If the value of the "noMoreThan" attribute becomes less than or
      equal to zero, an error in processing has occurred, the data
      element is not sent to the next relay, and if the "reportErrors"
      attribute is true, the APEX report service is invoked to send an
      error report.

Internet-Draft     The APEX Publish-Subscribe Service     September 2001


   Further, note that because this option is processed on a per-hop
   basis, the originator must set the "targetHop" attribute to the value
   "all" and the "mustUnderstand" attribute to the value "true".

   If the APEX report service (c.f., Section 6.2 of [2]) is invoked to
   send an error report, it issues a data operation with:

   o  its originator identifying the report service associated with the
      issuing relay

   o  its recipient identifying the endpoint address of the originator
      associated with the "dataHopping" option

   o  its content consisting of a "statusResponse" element having:

      *  its "transID" attribute equal to the "transID" attribute of the
         "dataHopping" option

      *  and identifying the original recipient with a permanent failure
         indicator

7. Security Considerations

   Consult [2]'s Section 11 for a discussion of APEX security issues.

   The APEX access [7] service provides considerable flexibility to
   administrators.  For example:

   To implement a policy that only allows applications within the
   example.com administrative domain to create and delete topics in that
   administrative domain, the APEX access service would contain the
   entry:

       <access owner='apex=pubsub@example.com'
               actor='*@example.com'
               actions='pubsub:createtopic pubsub:deletetopic' />

   To implement a policy that allows any application to subscribe to the
   music.jazz.milesdavis topic in the example.com administrative and
   that allows a pubsub server in the forwarder.com domain to handle
   distributed subscription management for this topic, the APEX access
   service would contain the entries:

          <access owner='apex=pubsub/music.jazz.milesdavis@example.com'
                  actor='*@*'
                  actions='pubsub:subscribe' />
          <access owner='apex=pubsub/music.jazz.milesdavis@example.com'
                  actor='apex=pubsub/music.jazz.milesdavis@forwarder.com'
                  actions='pubsub:subscribe' />

   To implement a policy that allows anyone to publish to the
   music.jazz.milesdavis topic in the example.com administrative domain,
   the APEX access service would contain the entry:

       <access owner='apex=pubsub/music.jazz.milesdavis@example.com'
               actor='*@*'
               actions='core:data' />

   To add an exception list stating that mr.slate@example.com is not
   allowed to publish to this topic, the APEX access service would
   contain the above entry and also this entry:

       <access owner='apex=pubsub/music.jazz.milesdavis@example.com'
               actor='mr.slate@example.com'
               actions='' />

Internet-Draft     The APEX Publish-Subscribe Service     September 2001


   To implement a policy that only allows people who are subscribed to a
   topic to publish to that topic, the pubsub service would update the
   set of access entries whenever a subscribe or cancel operation was
   successfully performed.  For example, when user barney@rubble.com
   subscribes to the music.jazz.milesdavis topic in the example.com
   administrative domain, the following token would be added to the APEX
   access service:

       <access owner='apex=pubsub/music.jazz.milesdavis@example.com'
               actor='barney@rubble.com'
               actions='core:data' />
