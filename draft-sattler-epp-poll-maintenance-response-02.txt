2.  Common Data Types

   JSON [RFC7159] defines the data types of a number, character string,
   boolean, array, object, and null.  This section describes the
   semantics and/or syntax reference for common, JSON character strings
   used in this document.
   
   notifications:    contains a single NTFY

   id:               UUID according [RFC4122] for each NTFY, SHOULD NOT
                     be changed if it gets postponed
                     
   systems:          contains name, host and impact
   
   name:             name of affected system
   
   host:             affected maintained system (host or ip).
                     hostname SHOULD be punycode according [RFC3492].
                     IPv4 addresses SHOULD be dotted-decimal notation.
                     An example of this textual representation is
                     "192.0.2.0".
                     IPv6 addresses SHOULD be according [RFC5952].

   impact:           impact level per affected sytem; values are either
                     'partial' or 'blackout'
                     
   environment:      environment of affected maintained system
   
   start:            start of maintenance according ISO 8601 [RFC3339]

   reason:           free text why it is necessary, MAY be empty
                     
   remark:           URI to detailed maintenance description, MAY be
                     empty
                     
   tlds:             contains affected top-level domains punycode
                     encoded according [RFC3492]
   
   intervention:     contains connection and implementation
   
   connection:       true or false - indicates if DNRR needs to do
                     something that is connection related
                     
   implementation:   true or false - indicates if DNRR needs to do
                     something that is implementation related

3.  Common Data Structures

   This section defines common data structures used in responses and
   object classes.
   
3.1. Notification

   The data structure named "notification" is an array and contains a
   single NTFY.
   
   An example "notification" data structure:

   "notification": {
     "id":"2e6df9b0-4092-4491-bcc8-9fb2166dcee6",
     "system":[{
       "name":"EPP",
       "host":"epp.registry.example",
       "impact":"blackout"
     }],
     "environment":"production",
     "start":"2017-04-30T06:00:00+00:00",
     "end":"2017-04-30T07:00:00+00:00",
     "reason":"planned maintenance",
     "remark":"http//portal.registry.example/maintenance-desc",
     "tlds":["example","test"],
     "intervention":{
       "connection":false,
       "implementation":false
     }
   }

3.2.  Systems

   The data structure named "systems" is an array of strings, indicating
   the systems affected by the maintenance.
   
   An example "systems" data structure:
   
   "systems":
   [
     {
       "name":"EPP",
       "host":"epp.registry.example",
       "impact":"partial"
     },
     {
       "name":"WHOIS",
       "host":"whois.registry.example",
       "impact":"partial"
     },
     {
       "name":"Portal",
       "host":"https://portal.registry.example",
       "impact":"blackout"
     }
   ]
   
3.3.  Intervention

   The data structure named "intervention" is an array of boolean, each
   indicating if the DNRR needs to do something.
   
   An example "intervention" data structure:
   
   "intervention":{
     "connection":true,
     "implementation":false
   }
   
3.4. TLDs

   The data structure named "tlds" is an array of strings indicating the
   affected top level domains of the DNRY.
   
   An example "intervention" data structure:
   
   "tlds":[
     "example",
     "test"
   ]
   
4.  EPP poll response

   According to EPP [RFC5730], the EPP poll response allows mixed
   content and also be returned without object information.

5.  IANA Considerations
   
6.  Security Considerations

   This specification models information serialized in JSON format.  As
   JSON is a subset of JavaScript, implementations are advised to follow
   the security considerations outlined in Section 6 of [RFC7159] to
   prevent code injection.
   
   Implementers should be aware of the security considerations specified
   in [RFC5730].
   
7.  Internationalisation Considerations

7.1.  Character Encoding

   The default text encoding for JSON responses in RDAP is UTF-8
   [RFC3629], and all servers and clients MUST support UTF-8.
   
7.2.  Internationalised Domain Names

   Affected TLDs as mention in Section 2 SHOULD be provided in punycode
   according [RFC3492].

Appendix A.  Motivations for using JSON

   This section addresses a common question regarding the use of JSON
   over other data formats, most notably XML.
   
   It is often pointed out that DNRY and DNRR support the EPP
   [RFC5730] standard, which is an XML serialised protocol.  The logic
   is that since EPP is a common protocol in the industry, it follows
   that XML would be a more natural choice.
   
   While that being true, the intent to use JSON is to use the already
   approved and reliable EPP command <poll> and its capabilities to
   transport mixed content without object information instead of
   creating a new EPP extension.
