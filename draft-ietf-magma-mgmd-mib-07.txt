1. Introduction
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects used for managing the Internet
   Group Management Protocol (IGMP), version 1 [4], version 2 [5] or
   version 3 [6] and the Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) protocol
   version 1 [7] or version 2 [8]. Both protocols provide multicast
   membership discovery capability, IGMP pertains to IP version 4
   clients, and MLD for IP version 6 clients. This version of the MIB
   supercedes both rfc2933 [10] and rfc3019 [11], incorporating a
   generic interface for both IGMP and MLD implementations, and changes
   to enable "source filtering" in multicast clients. The MIB
   encompasses both router and host nodes with relevant management
   objects defined for each.


2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [9].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [1], STD 58, RFC 2579 [2] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [3].
   

3. Overview

   This MIB module contains eight tables:

     1. the MGMD Host Interface Table which contains one row for each
        interface on which MGMD is enabled on a host,

     2. the MGMD Router Interface Table which contains one row for each
        interface on which MGMD is enabled on a router,

     3. the MGMD Host Cache Table which contains one row for each IP
        multicast group for which there are members on a particular


   Chesterfield           I-D - Expires March 2006            [Page 2]
               Multicast Group Membership Discovery MIB

        interface on a host,

     4. the MGMD Router Cache Table which contains one row for each IP
        multicast group for which there are members on a particular
        interface on a router,

     5. the reverse MGMD Host Table which contains one row for each 
        interface for which there are active multicast groups on a host,

     6. the reverse MGMD Router Table which contains one row for each 
        interface for which there are active multicast groups on a 
        router,

     7. the MGMD HostSrcList Table which contains one row for each 
        entry in the source filter record for an interface and 
        multicast group pair on a host.
				
     8. the MGMD RouterSrcList Table which contains one row for each 
        entry in the source filter record for an interface and 
        multicast group pair on a router.

   All tables are intended for EITHER router OR host functionality as 
   indicated by the name and corresponding description, although it is 
   anticipated that there would be scenarios where both terms might 
   apply to a device, e.g. a router which joins a multicast group also 
   as a host for measurement purposes. The source list tables provide
   an extension to the cache tables to indicate the source specific 
   includes or excludes associated with each IP Multicast group on 
   each specific interface. This functionality is only supported in 
   IGMPv3 and MLDv2 capable nodes.

5. Security Considerations

   This MIB contains readable objects whose values provide information
   related to multicast sessions.  Some of these objects could contain
   sensitive information.  In particular, the mgmdCacheLastReporter
   object can be used to identify machines which are


   Chesterfield           I-D - Expires March 2006            [Page 27]
               Multicast Group Membership Discovery MIB

   listening to a given group address.  There are also a number of
   objects that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-
   create, which allow an administrator to configure MGMD state in the
   router.

   While unauthorized access to the readable objects is relatively
   innocuous, unauthorized access to the write-able objects could cause
   a denial of service.  Hence, the support for SET operations in a
   non-secure environment without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.

   SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the
   network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and SET (change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [13] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to this MIB, is properly configured to give
   access to those objects only to those principals (users) that have
   legitimate rights to access them.


6. IANA Considerations

   This MIB introduces a new protocol description, Multicast Group
   Membership Discovery, that encompasses both the IPv4 Multicast
   discovery protocol, IGMP, and the IPv6 Multicast discovery protocol,
   MLD. As such it requires the allocation of a new OID within the MIB
   hierarchy. MGMD is a superset of the objects defined in RFCs 2933 and
   3019 and therefore there is no new protocol definition involved in
   this specification.
