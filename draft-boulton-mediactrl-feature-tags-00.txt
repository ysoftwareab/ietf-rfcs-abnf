Abstract

   This specification defines a profile set of media feature tags that
   can be used with the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  The media
   feature tags allow a Media Server to communicate a basic set of media
   server capabilities that are supported to its Application Server.

1.  Introduction

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), as defined in RFC 3261
   [RFC3261], is used in a variety of different ways to establish
   multimedia sessions between entities.  SIP works in conjunction with
   the Offer/Answer exchange, as defined in [RFC3264] for establishing
   the underlying media session.

   Media Feature tags are used by SIP, which can be found in RFC 3840
   [RFC3840], for the purpose of making appropriate routing decisions
   based on capabilities that have been advertised.

   This specification defines a basic set of media feature tags and
   reuses existing media feature tags where possible to allow an
   Application Server to route a SIP protocol request to the most
   appropriate Media Server.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   In this document, BCP 14/RFC 2119 [RFC2119] defines the key words
   "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL".  In addition, BCP 15 indicates requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.

   This document inherits terminology proposed in the MediaCtrl
   Architecture [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-architecture] and MediaCtrl SIP
   Control Framework [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework]
   documents.

3.  Motivation

   Solutions related to media services such as IVR and conference mixing
   cover an extremely wide scope.  Systems can range from simple voice
   announcements to complex multimedia mixes.  In the architecture
   defined in [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-architecture], it is the role of an
   Applications Server (AS) and Media Server (MS) to interact using
   mechanisms such as the SIP Control Framework
   [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework].  As part of this process
   the AS will often have to select an MS based on the capabilities of
   the media sessions that are being established.

   For complex systems where an AS makes Media Server selection
   decisions based on a wide range of both dynamic and static data, an
   entity called a Media Resource Broker (MRB) is required.  More
   details relating to the logical role of an MRB can be found in
   [I-D.boulton-mediactrl-mrb].

   For simple systems that require selection based on relatively static
   data this document defines a number of media feature tags that can be
   used to register capabilities.

   A media server traditionally performs the role of a SIP endpoint,
   User Agent Server (UAS).  As a consequence, it is plausible that a
   media server would act as a traditional SIP endpoint and use the SIP
   REGISTER to manage available capabilities.  Using SIP REGISTER in
   this way is described in RFC 3840 [RFC3840].  As a consequence of
   using the REGISTER request for capability advertising and session
   selection, a number of other interesting properties that SIP provides
   are inherited for free.  This includes:

   o  Dynamic and graceful Media Server availability.

   o  Load balancing across registered contacts.

   The media feature tags could also be registered with an AS using some
   other means.  This is considered out of the scope of this document.

   It should be noted that complex system are able to make use of both
   MRB style selection and take advantage of the mechanisms that have
   been defined in this document.  Doing so provides a robust MS
   selection process.

   EDITORS Note: Need to document more on how both mechanisms would fit
   together.

4.  Requirements

   The requirements for brokering a media server is introduced in the
   MediaCtrl control protocol
   requirements[I-D.ietf-mediactrl-requirements] document.  In addition
   to those general requirements, the following will form the basis of
   this solution:

   o  REQ-01 - Media servers should be able to register basic functions
      that can be carried out on a media session.

   o  REQ-02 - The granularity for registering capabilities should be
      set at an appropriate and defined level that does not conflict but
      works in tandem with other MediaCtrl functions.

   o  REQ-03 - The solution should provide an appropriate extension
      mechanism for defining new capabilities.

   Editors Note: Input required.

5.  Media Feature Tag Definitions

   The following list provides a description of the media feature tags
   used in conjunction with this draft.  It should be noted that where
   possible, this document reuses media feature tags defined in RFC 3840
   [RFC3840].

   o  Feature_tag_1

   o  Feature_tag_2

   [Editors Note: The next version of the document will contain various
   media feature tags as a result of mailing list discussion.
