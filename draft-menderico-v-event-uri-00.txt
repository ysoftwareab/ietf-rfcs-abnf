Internet-Draft                 v-event URI                 November 2015


1.  Introduction

   Calendar users currently often do not have the ability to quickly add
   an event to theirdefault calendar app, when encountering event data
   on a webpage, poster or mobile apps.  In this sense events have
   fallen behind other real world entities, like e-mail [RFC6068] and
   geo coordinates [RFC5870] which allow for performing actions in
   default apps when encountering these entities anywhere.  This
   recommendations document addresses the problem by proposing best
   practices when embedding and publishing calendar data.  We believe
   that using a standardized URI scheme for event publishing will make
   populating of users' calendars much simpler, will make developers'
   lives easier and will increase calendar apps usage in general.  A
   major additional benefit of URIs is sharing of events on physical
   media (for example via QR codes) or via URL.

2.  Motivation and related work

2.1.  Current event publishing practices

   Many ways to add events to calendar apps have been developed due to
   the lack of standardization.  While these solve the basic need of
   sharing events, it does so with limited reach, are harder to use and
   limit adoption by new providers.  We will briefly mention four common
   ways: using a download link, hCalendar embedding, using VEVENTs in QR
   codes and provider specific buttons.

2.1.1.  Publish a link to an iCalendar file

   A simple way to publish an event i sto share a link that points to an
   iCalendar [RFC5545] file and provide a link to the user for
   downloading it.  In an ideal world, a user would click on the link
   pointing to a file, the browser would recognize this link as a
   calendar file and redirect it to the proper calendar application,
   which would display the event information to the user, allowing
   simple edit actions, and saving it to the calendar.

   There are many problems with this method.  Files must be hosted in a
   server, which is not always feasible or easy, and need to be
   maintained separately from the web pages they are linked from.  This
   poses unnecessary difficulty for blog and CMS users, especially when
   compared to linking to email addresses or other web pages.

   Furthermore, ICS files might not be recognized by the browser or
   operating system, or the user might use a web-based calendar app
   instead of a native one.  Files might also contain malware and pose
   additional risk, with some end users avoiding downloaded files
   altogether.

Internet-Draft                 v-event URI                 November 2015


   One additional problem is coupling of the file and the entity it
   represents.  Currently the user needs to manually keep the event file
   and all the links and descriptions with the same information in the
   links about in sync.  It is preferable to have this information close
   together.  Ideally the same tools used to generate a page could be
   used to assure a link and the text information being displayed are
   synchronized.

2.1.2.  Current QR code implementations

   Several QR code readers ([ZXing][i-nigma]) support calendar events to
   be embedded in QR codes, but they have their own non-standard
   implementation, usually a single VEVENT iCalendar component.  They
   work well on the mobile platform but rely on OS internals
   [CalendarContract] to add the event to the calendar.

   While QR code does not dictate a format for calendar events, most
   readers implement the URI standard schemes and would benefit from
   this proposal.

2.1.3.  hCalendar

   hCalendar [hCalendar] is a microformat for events that can be used to
   annotate a web page or another document and indicate to readers that
   an event is present.  While microformats are useful for parsing and
   styling, they are not meant to be used as links to an event and need
   to be used in conjunction with the external ICS file method or a
   proprietary browser extension.  They usually require a complex
   interaction between the website and the calendar application to get
   it right.  This also makes it not ideal for QR scanning, since the
   annotations were not designed to represent the whole content of a
   document.  They are more appropriate as an annotation on a previously
   structured text.

2.1.4.  Custom calendar application link

   Several calendar systems provide a proprietary URL for event creation
   ([AddThisEvent][GoogleCalendar]).  However, due to lack of standards,
   applications must implement and link to these separately.  This
   burdens both content creators and web site users: content creators
   must maintain individual links for each calendar application
   provider, and end users must find and choose the appropriate one for
   their own case.  This consumes precious space on the page and
   requires understanding of several APIs, making it difficult for a
   developer that wants to just publish a simple event.  Furthermore,
   it's impossible to link to all calendar app providers, requiring a
   combination of this method with the ICS file hosting method.

2.2.  Alternative implementations

   Tthough not currently used by the most popular calendar applications,
   other implementations could theoretically converge into a standard.
   We will talk briefly about the calendar mime type in combination with
   RegisterContentHandler, data URI scheme and a custom URI scheme.

2.2.1.  text/calendar MIME type in combination with
        RegisterContentHandler

   One way to use iCal files and avoid downloading it would be
   registering a handler for calendar MIME [RFC6838] types (text/
   calendar [RFC5545]).  Operating Systems know how to handle mime type
   properly, and are able to redirect it to the right application.  Web
   browsers, on the other hand, still have limited capability to handle
   it.  The method RegisterContentHandler [RegisterContentHandler]
   allows to send a given mime type file directly to a website, but so
   far has only been implemented by Mozilla and only supports atom/xml
   MIME type.

2.2.2.  data URI

   Data URIs [RFC2397] can be used to replace an external file in an
   HTML.  One advantage is that it gets embedded into the HTML and
   removes the need of an external file, either a real file or emulated.
   Unfortunately, browsers treat these the same way they treat files,
   therefore they would still need to be downloaded or properly
   redirected to an application, and RegisterContentHandler would need
   to be implemented by browsers and QR readers before this approach can
   be used.

2.2.3.  Custom URI scheme

   A custom URI scheme for events would behave similar to e-mail
   [RFC6068] geo [RFC5870] and other schemes, where the resource
   (e-mail, geo, or in this case, the event) is properly identified and
   follows a specified protocol.  An HTML page could publish an event
   using this scheme (as it would with any other link format) or a print
   page could embed it in an 2D-barcode.  The user would have several
   options of handling it: opening his application of choice, or
   redirecting to a previously registered website
   [RegisterProtocolHandler].  Support for URI schemes is widespread,
   most Operating Systems and browsers support it and its associated
   APIs.

3.  The v-event URI scheme

   In this section we will propose a custom URI schema that could be
   implemented easily by any calendar application and developers alike.
   We will also discuss some of its special requirements and provide
   several examples

3.1.  Syntax

   The v-event URI scheme syntax is based on both iCalendar [RFC5545]
   and data URI scheme [RFC2397], we intend to make it trivial for
   people used to iCalendar syntax to implement this scheme, and also
   make it consistent with other existing URI formats.  The basic syntax
   for the URI is:

                            v-event:[base64,] icalendar event

   To be compatible with the generic URI syntax [RFC3986], the whole URI
   needs to follow the percent encoding escaping.  The iCalendar event
   can be either written as an escaped text or, if base64 is specified,
   converted to base64.  Calendar applications MUST recognize both
   formats to be compliant with this URI scheme For the iCalendar the
   following restrictions apply:

   o  Exactly one entity in the VCALENDAR (VEVENT / VTODO) must be
      specified.

   o  MUST be a valid entity as specified by RFC 5545 [RFC5545], except
      for rules specified in this document that can violate the RFC
      specification

   o  Start and End dates MUST contain timezone through the TZID param,
      as described in section 3.8.2.2 and 3.8.2.4 of RFC 5545 [RFC5545]

   o  Timezones MUST be specified using one of the valid names from the
      IANA timezone database (tz) [tz].  Also, VTIMEZONE entries MUST
      NOT be added to the v-event URI or to the source files.  All
      calendar applications reading events will recognize these names
      (see Section 3.4.2 for more details)

   o  The event MUST contain a UID, as specified by section 3.8.4.7 of
      RFC 5545 [RFC5545]

   o  The VCALENDAR object MAY contain a SOURCE field
      [CalDavExtensions], pointing to an ICS file that can contain extra
      information about the event contained in the calendar.  If the
      source file and the entry contradict each other, the information
      presented in the source MUST prevail.  If the source is available,

Internet-Draft                 v-event URI                 November 2015


      the event contained in the source file MUST have the same UID as
      the event expressed by the URI

   o  The URI size MUST fit in the medium you're choosing to transmit
      it, For reference, URIs larger than 2048 characters are known to
      not work properly on all browsers, and QR codes have a hard limit
      of 2953 characters in its most permissive encoding.  In practice,
      we recommend limiting the URI to 1024 characters and our tests
      have shown 500 characters are usually enough for most common
      scenarios.

   o  LAST-MODIFIED field, as specified by section 3.8.7.3 of RFC 5545
      [RFC5545] MUST be included to allow for changes to be detected by
      calendar handler applications

3.2.  URI Registration

   The v-event URI will be registered with IANA as a provisional scheme,
   to allow all calendar applications to use it.  The authors are not
   pursuing a permanent registration because they believe that this
   scheme may be deprecated in the future in favor of a DATA URI scheme,
   when browser implementations support that scheme with the same level
   regular URIs are supported.

   The following are the fields required by RFC 7595 [RFC7595]

   o  Scheme name: v-event

   o  Status: provisional

   o  Applications/protocols that use this scheme name: Hypertext (for
      example, web pages, e-mail.  QR code readers), calendar
      applications.

3.3.  Examples

3.3.1.  V-Event URI 101 - a simple example

   In this first example, we will start with a simple event that follows
   all the recommendations above.  This event starts on March 23rd,
   2233, at midnight and finishes at 11:59 PM at the same day, in

   Eastern Time.  It has been last modified on April 1st, 2015.  From
   these, we have the following icalendar event:

                   BEGIN:VCALENDAR
                   BEGIN:VEVENT
                   SUMMARY:James T. Kirk's birthday
                   DTSTART;TZID=US/Eastern:22330322T000000
                   DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern:22330322T235900
                   UID:8726bc91-a168-4c42-9568-a0e7d35724d6@example.com
                   LAST-MODIFIED:20150401T000000Z
                   END:VEVENT
                   END:VCALENDAR

   which leads to the v-event URI:

                v-event:BEGIN%3AVCALENDAR%0D%0ABEGIN%3AVEVENT%0D%0ASUMMARY
                %3AJames%20T.%20Kirk%27s%20birthday%0D%0ADTSTART%3BTZID%3DUS

                9568-a0e7d35724d6%40example.com%0D%0ALAST-MODIFIED%3A
                20150401T000000Z%0D%0AEND%3AVEVENT%0D%0AEND%3AVCALENDAR

3.3.2.  Base 64 encoding

   As mentioned before, calendar applications also need to be able to
   interpret base64 versions of the URIs, the example below represents
   the same event described in Section 3.3.1:

              v-event:base64,QkVHSU46VkNBTEVOREFSDQpCRUdJTjpWRVZFTlQNClNVTU1BU
              lk6SmFtZXMgVC4gS2lyaydzIGJpcnRoZGF5DQpEVFNUQVJUO1RaSUQ9VVMvRWF

              DAwMDAwWg0KRU5EOlZFVkVOVA0KRU5EOlZDQUxFTkRBUg==

3.3.3.  Source link

   A source link should be added if the URI cannot fit all information
   about a given event or for any other reason you believe that an ICS
   file may better suit your needs.  For the same example in
   Section 3.3.1, we can add the source URL 'http://www.example.com/
   kirk.ics' and we would obtain the following URIs:

3.3.4.  QR code examples

   A QR code containing the first example (Section 3.3.1) can be found
   at https://goo.gl/lQXIwP.  It has been generated using the ZXing
   barcode generator([ZXing]).

3.4.  Application requirements and best practices

3.4.1.  Event publisher

   For event publishers, the following extra requirements must me met:

   o  If your entry contains a SOURCE field pointing to an URI, the
      publisher is responsible for keeping the link live and with up-to-
      date information while the event information is relevant (i.e, the
      link must exist until the event expires).

   There are also some best practices that need to be followed by these
   publishers in regard to UID generation and the LAST-MODIFIED field,
   which are discussed in the following subsections.

Internet-Draft                 v-event URI                 November 2015


3.4.1.1.  UID generation

   According to RFC 5545 [RFC5545], every event MUST be published with
   an UID, so calendar applications can detect multiple occurrences of
   it and remove them.  The UID MUST be a globally unique identifier,
   and the system generating the event must guarantee it is unique.  The
   recommended way is to generate an id that is internal to a given
   system (for instance, a database incremental id, an UUID, or
   something similar) and append the domain name or IP address at the
   end, separating them by an @.

   For example, all these are valid unique ids for domain example.com
   that fit this recommendation and also RFC 5545 [RFC5545]:

   o  [1@example.com]: a simple numerical id, useful if you are creating
      your first event and has no intention to create another or can
      manage the ids manually.

   o  [user-29960401T080000Z-1@example.com]: An UID for an event from
      user 'user' that starts April first, 2996, at 8:00 AM, and uses
      the username and date as keys.

   o  [f47935ee-ec5e-4d87-ba26-05e970674a88@example.com]: a UID which
      uses UUIDs based on RFC 4122 [RFC4122].  Theoretically, UUIDs are
      themselves unique, but to conform with the recommendation we also
      appended the domain name.

3.4.2.  Calendar applications requirements

   For calendar data handlers, the following set of extra rules apply:

   o  An event MUST only be handled by a calendar application after an
      user performed an action, such as clicking on a link or scanning a
      QR code.  Events published using the URI SHOULD NOT be added
      automatically.

   o  Calendar data handlers MUST retain sufficient information to
      determine that an event has changed so that it can inform the
      user.

   o  If a user deletes a previously downloaded event the handler should
      recognize that and ignore the event unless explicitly clicked on.

   o  A calendar application must keep its timezone database always up-
      to-date and adjust events accordingly.  Timezones will be
      specified by reference (i.e., their ISO names, according to [tz])
      and any calendar application MUST understand these.

4.  Security and privacy considerations

   Below are some guidelines applications implementing v-event URI
   generators and parsers need to follow in order to avoid security and
   privacy issues.

   o  Whenever a SOURCE link is available, the application MUST ask the
      user whether to follow the link, since there may be costs
      associated with downloading data and the user may want to perform
      this operation in a different environment.

   o  Calendar applications MAY check a SOURCE link periodically to
      check for changes, but MUST NOT update an event automatically
      based on new information provided by the user.  If new information
      is available through the SOURCE link, calendar applications SHOULD
      inform the user and ask for his consent before performing any
      change in his calendar.

   o  Reading an v-event URI or following a SOURCE link and downloading
      a file may pose a security thread if not carefully handled.
      Particularly code reading these files should be careful to not get
      exposed to common security bugs like buffer overflows.

   o  A SOURCE link SHOULD not be used only as a tracking mechanism, if
      a link is provided there should be some extra information being
      provided by it or at least the possibility that the information
      will be updated if necessary

   o  A SOURCE link MUST not require a calendar account in any calendar
      manager, and MUST NOT represent any form of event subscription by
      a particular system.  Any event subscription action REQUIRES user
      acknowledgement and approval before being performed.

   o  Note that there is no hard limit on the size of a SOURCE file, but
      it is expected that these contain information only about a single
      event (i.e., one VEVENT) or recurring event (several VEVENTs with
      the same RECURRENCE-ID) This has implications for both writers and
      readers of these source files:

      *  Writers MUST always provided well-formed data that complies to
         this document and, more generally, to iCalendar format
         [RFC5545].

      *  Readers can't rely on the size of an input to decide whether it
         is valid or not, and SHOULD implement parsers that detect
         inconsistencies.

5.  Future work

   As mentioned in section Section 2.2.2, the data URI scheme would be a
   nice fit for providing an uniform format for specifying events in the
   Web and printed media (QR and other formats), and we have only chosen
   another method because data support is currently limited.

   We plan to update this document with a data URI compatible format as
   soon as its support is more widespread, allowing it to be used by
   native applications, browser applications and physical media with the
   same support currently available for regular URIs.  The format
   specified here is compatible with data URI and minimal changes would
   be needed to convert from one format to another.
