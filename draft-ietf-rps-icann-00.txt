Abstract



RPS Security [2] requires certain RPSL [1] objects in the IRR to be
hierarchically delegated.  The set of objects that are at the root of this
hierarchy needs to be created and digitally signed by ICANN. This paper

Internet Draft                  RPS ICANN Issues                 June 25, 1999



presents these seed objects and lists operations required from ICANN.



1 Initial Seed



A public key of ICANN needs to be distributed with the software
implementations of Distributed Routing Policy System [3].  An initial set of
seed objects are needed to be signed with this key.  They are:

Here, we assume that ICANN runs its own repository.  However this is not a
requirement.  Instead, it may publish its objects with one of the existing
routing registries.


This set of seed objects needs to be signed with the hard coded ICANN key.
Later, ICANN objects can be signed with the key in the ICANN key-cert
object.



2 ICANN Assignments



Each time ICANN makes an assignment, it needs to create inetnum and as-block
objects as appropriate and digitally sign them using the key in its key-cert
object.  For example:



as-block:      AS0 - AS500
descr:         arin's space
country:       us
status:        ALLOCATED
source:        icann
delegated:    arin
mnt-by:        mnt-icann


inetnum:       128.0.0.0 - 128.255.255.255
netname:       Internet portion
descr:         ip number space

3 Creating Routing Repositories



To enable a new routing repository, a repository object, a maintainer object
and a key-cert object (if the maintainer object uses it) needs to be created
and digitally signed by ICANN. For example:



  mntner:         mnt-ripe
  descr:          RIPE's maintainer
  auth:           <ripe's choice>
  mnt-by:         mnt-ripe
  referral-by:   mnt-icann
  admin-c:        . . .
  tech-c:         . . .
  upd-to:         . . .
  mnt-nfy:        . . .
  source:         RIPE

  remarks:             these are the authentication types supported

This very first transaction of a new repository is placed in the new
repository, not in the ICANN repository.



4 Security Consideration



This document describes ICANN procedures and initial RPSL seed objects.  It
does not define protocols or standards that need to be secured.
