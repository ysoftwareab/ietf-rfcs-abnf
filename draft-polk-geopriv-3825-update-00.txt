Abstract

   This document updates RFC 3825 (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 
   Option for Coordinate-based Location Configuration Information) to 
   allow versioning, and proposes changes that enable the ability to  
   express confidence and uncertainty values as an alternative to 
   expressing bits of resolution.

1.  Introduction  

   Rough consensus from the community has motivated this document to 
   propose an update RFC 3825 (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 
   Option for Coordinate-based Location Configuration Information) to 
   account for versioning. The reason for this is the feeling that the 
   resolution bits are better served expressing other data, such as 
   confidence and uncertainty.

   The DHCP Option (123) in RFC 3825 [RFC3825] is only 17 bytes in 
   length, and there are no reserved bits to assign, therefore anything
   added needs to take bits - or entire fields - from something already
   assigned in the existing Option.

   This proposal borrows an idea from [ID-3825bis] of reassigning the 
   resolution fields into confidence and uncertainty fields.

   The most obvious place to steal bits from outside of the resolution 
   bits is from the 8 bit datum field.  Currently, there are 3 datums 
   IANA registered. It is foreseen that few others will be necessary. 
   Therefore, this appears to be a logical place to steal bits.  At 
   issue is the number of bits to be used for this purpose.  

   In an effort to accommodate other specifications that utilize the 
   Option defined by RFC3825, these additions do not force changes to 
   those specifications.  Specifically, IEEE 802.11k and 802.11y refer 
   to RFC3825. To ensure compatibility with those specifications and 
   the original RFC3825, we have to look for what can accommodate each 
   specification.  



Polk, et al.         Expires October 23, 2009                  [Page 2]
Internet-Draft        DHCP Geo Option Update                 April 2009

   While 802.11k has not changed the datum field from that in RFC 3825,
   802.11y has. 802.11y, in 2008, reduced the number of datum bits from
   8 to 3 bits [IEEE.11y], shown here:

       0             7         0     3 4 5   7     
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     Datum     |  ---> |Datum|1|2|3|res|
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

       Datum field in        Five new fields in .11y
          RFC 3825            from that in RFC 3825

   802.11y have additionally assigned the middle 3 bits as individual 
   flags, and have left the 2 most significant bits (MSB) as 
   "reserved".  In an effort to provide harmony, this proposal 
   specifically does not make use of the bits reassigned in the IEEE 
   specification.  Future revisions of this specification may be in 
   conflict with the IEEE specification and will be re-evaluated at 
   that time.  So, supporting the IEEE, this specification utilizes the
   2 MSB to declare a version value. This leaves 4 possible versions, 
   where version 1 is defined by RFC 3825. Version 2 is defined here.

   Section 2 of this document discusses versioning in more detail.  
   Section 3 discusses how the resolution bits are reassigned into 
   confidence and uncertainty fields in version 2 (RFC 3825 is to be 
   considered version 1).  Section 4 discusses what to do with RFC 
   3825's appendix in this and subsequent versions of Option 123.


2.  Versioning in DHCP Option 123

   This proposal concludes the best bits to steal are from the existing
   8 bit datum field, the described in RFC 3825 Option format.  

   This document proposes the IETF adopt conformance with the IEEE in 
   this case by only having the ability to have 4 versions of Option 
   123, from the 2 MSB (on the left).  This would look like this:

       0             7         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7     
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     Datum     |  ---> |Datum| res |ver|
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

       Datum field in         field split into 3 
          RFC 3825            separate field in  

   This preserves compliance with existing .11y implementations and 
   definitions, and yields the DHCP the ability to have 4 versions of 
   this Option.

   The middle 3 bits (specifically bits 3, 4 and 5) are proposed to be 
   newly classified as "reserved". This aligns with 802.11y, and allows 


Polk, et al.         Expires October 23, 2009                  [Page 3]
Internet-Draft        DHCP Geo Option Update                 April 2009

   the IETF and IEEE to work out how to encroach into this space in the
   future for, perhaps, more datum space, or more versioning space, or 
   something entirely different. 

   [Editor's note: These 3 reserved bits are not set as mandatory 
                   within this proposal.]


2.1 Backwards Compatibility with Option 123 Version 1

   Version 2 and later implementations will remain backwards compatible
   as long as they use each field assigned in RFC 3825 as is described 
   in that document.  If a version 1 client uses a datum not defined 
   within RFC 3825, it will not parse the content properly. To date, no 
   new datums have been assigned to the IANA registry for this datum 
   field, therefore this has always been the case. This likely will 
   cause an error by the client.  

   Version 1 implementations that receive a version 2 Option, for 
   example with WGS84 as the datum, will not receive the expected field
   value of 1, shown here:

       0             7
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0|
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
          Version 1

   but that of 65, shown here:

       0             7
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0|
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
          Version 2


3.  Replacing Resolution Fields with Confidence and Uncertainty

   It is best at this point to merely review what is written in 
   [ID-3825bis] for the specifics on what could go here.

 [Editor's note: we authors do not have permission, based on RFC 5378, 
                 to copy the text from [ID-3825bis] at this time. That 
                 text is probably the best available to suit this 
                 section, and we want to avoid attempting to rewrite 
                 that text.]


4.  What to do with RFC 3825's Appendix

   In version 2 and later of Option 123, readers SHOULD simply ignore 


Polk, et al.         Expires October 23, 2009                  [Page 4]
Internet-Draft        DHCP Geo Option Update                 April 2009

   the appendix from RFC 3825.  Without the resolution fields, that 
   appendix serves no purpose.


5.  Security considerations

   There are no additional security considerations outside those 
   written in RFC 3825.


6.  IANA considerations

   This document does not have any IANA actions (at this time).
