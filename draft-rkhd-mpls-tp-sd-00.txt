1. Introduction

   Telecommunication carriers expect to replace aged TDM Services (e.g.
   legacy VPN services) provided by legacy TDM equipments to new VPN
   services provided by MPLS-TP Equipments.

   From service level agreement (SLA) point of view, any degradations of
   service quality and service availability even after migration of
   legacy TDM equipment are not allowed.

   And, from viewpoint of operational feasibility, the same performance
   monitoring granularity and unit are expected.                                                    This is because
   customer's requirements for network are NOT changed even after
   migrating from TDM to MPLS-TP.

   MPLS-TP LSP protection switching can be triggered by fault conditions
   and external manual commands. The fault conditions include Signal
   Failure (SF) and Signal Degrade (SD). The SD condition could be
   detected at an intermediate link based on lower layer indications or
   other sub-layer techniques.

   Since the protection switching may be managed at a different
   transport entity, an indication about the link condition is required
   to be sent over each affected LSP.

   This document describes the guidelines for SD detection oriented by
   lower layers indications, and overview of mechanism from for relaying
   the degraded LSP condition to the network element handling the LSP
   protection switching.

3. Signal Degrade and MPLS-TP protection switching

   MPLS-TP survivability framework [3] ability of a network to recover
   traffic delivery following degradation of network resources. draft-
   ietf-mpls-tp-oam-requirements [6] defines LSP protections mechanism
   and the state machine that prioritizes between SF, SD and operator
   manual commands.

   An LSP is considered to have SD fault, when at least one of the links
   it forwarded through has rate of errored bits exceeding a
   predetermined BER threshold.

4. SD detection method

4.1. Guidelines for SD detection

   The following are principals for determining link signal degrade
   condition:

   o  Method for determining signal degrade MUST not disrupt the
      services transmitted over the link (e.g. add delay or jitter to
      real time traffic)

   o  Criterion for determining signal degrade MUST be agnostic to the
      length of frames transmitted over the link

   o  Criterion for determining signal degrade MUST be agnostic to the
      rate of frames transmitted over the link

   o  Criterion for determining signal degrade MUST be agnostic to the
      type of service carried by the frames transmitted over the link

Internet-Draft        draft-rkhd-mpls-tp-sd-00               June 2010


   o  Criterion for determining signal degrade MUST be agnostic to the
      traffic class of frames transmitted over the link

   o  Criterion for determining signal degrade MUST be agnostic to drop
      precedence marking of frames transmitted over the link

   o  Criterion for determining signal degrade MUST be agnostic to link
      congestion level

   o  Criterion for determining signal degrade SHOULD be able to detect
      low BER condition (e.g. 10E-5)

   o  Criterion for determining signal degrade SHOULD have low miss-
      detection probability

   o  Criterion for determining signal degrade SHOULD have low false
      alarm probability

   o  Criterion for determining signal degrade SHOULD be agnostic to
      number of LSPs or PWs forwarded over the link

   o  Method for determining signal degrade is RECOMMENDED not to
      require transmission of traffic exclusively dedicated for this
      purpose

4.2. Examples for SD detection methods

   A Server MEP [7] related to SONET or SDH sub-layers can determine SD
   condition based on errors indication from parity information embedded
   in encapsulation.

   A Server MEP related to OTN sub-layer can determine SD condition
   based on errors indication from Forward-Error-Correction
   functionality embedded in encapsulation.

   A Server MEP related to 10GE PCS sub-layer can determine SD condition
   based on rate of errored 66bit block headers.

   A Server MEP related to 1GE PCS sub-layer can determine SD condition
   based on rate of 10bit code violations dispersion errors.

   These examples would work as long as the layer carrying the
   information used for SD detection is not terminated in between two
   MPLS-TP transport entities (e.g. by use of media converter).

5. Transmission of link degradation fault indication

   When SD condition is detected, a link degradation fault indication
   [5] is transmitted over each affected LSP, in the down stream
   direction from the detection point.

   The encapsulation and mechanism for transmission of link degradation
   fault indication OAM message [5] are out of the scope of this
   document.

6. Handling of link degradation fault indication

   The mechanism for entering link degraded fault condition [5] is out
   of the scope of this document.

   Processing SD fault condition for protection triggering and
   prioritization [6] is out of the scope of this document.

7. Security Considerations

   To be added in a future version of the document.

8. IANA Considerations
