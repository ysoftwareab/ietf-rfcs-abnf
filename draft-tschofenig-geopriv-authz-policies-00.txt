   This document describes authorization policies for usage with
   Geopriv. It suggests using the eXtensible Access Control Markup
   Language (XACML). XACML provides functionality required to express
   policies for access to location information.

1.   Introduction

   Geopriv provides Location Information in a secure and private way.

   A critical role is played by user-controlled Privacy Rules, which
   describe the restrictions imposed or permissions given by the Rule
   Maker.  The Privacy Rules specify the necessary conditions that
   allow a Location Server to forward Location Information to a
   Location Recipient, and the conditions under which and purposes for
   which the Location Information can be used.

   One type of Privacy Rules specify in particular how location
   information should be filtered, depending on who the recipient is.
   Filtering is the process of reducing the precision or resolution of
   the data. A typical rule may be of the form: "my location can only
   be disclosed to the owner of such credentials in such precision or
   resolution" (e.g., "my co-workers can be told the city I am
   currently in").

   The Location Object should be able to carry a limited but core set
   of Privacy Rules.

   The access to location information (as XML objects) can be
   controlled by XACML policies. The same is true for writing and
   deleting Geopriv rules themselves. The Geopriv working group can
   benefit from reusing existing work on access control.

   This document therefore aims to provide the following description:

   a) It introduces the reader to XACML and describes some of the
   relevant features.

   b) It explores how access control is accomplished in the Geopriv
   environment.

   c) It gives examples of access control policies.

2.   Terminology

   This draft uses terminology described in [CM+03] and in [XACML].

3.   The Process of Access Control

   Figure 1 gives an abstract overview of the interaction between the
   participating entities. Different actions are performed by different
   entities requesting access to different information items stored at
   the location server. The location server needs to store information
   about users, group of users (including pseudonyms and roles). These
   entities are subject to authorization (among other attributes).

   The request from an entity to the Policy Decision Point, which is in
   this case the location server, is carried over a Geopriv 'using
   protocol'. A number of protocols might serve as a using protocol
   such as the Presence protocol as described in [Pet03]. Recently J.
   Rosenberg published the XML Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP)
   [XCAP] which describes how to read, write and delete application
   configuration data stored in XML format. XCAP can also be used to
   manipulate XML based location information (see [CG03]) and it is
   therefore another building block on the way to complete the work on
   the Geopriv framework. Instantiation of XCAP for usage with SIP in
   the area of presence (e.g. modification of buddy lists) can be found
   in [Ros03a] and in [Ros03b]. XCAP, however, does not describe how to
   control access to perform certain operations on these documents in a
   sophisticated fashion. This draft adds this missing piece.

   After the request reaches the location server it is necessary to
   compare the request with a number of policies deciding whether the
   operation is permitted or denied. More information on this step is
   given with the description of Figure 2 This verification requires
   matching a request with a number of rules and some sort of conflict
   resolution. For combining algorithms provided by XACML, the details
   of conflict resolution are given in Section 4.2.

   Access control policies for location information demand a flexible
   language to express the different needs such as:

   - My boss should be granted access to my location (civil location,
   building and room number only) only during working hours. My family
   is always allowed to access my exact location.

   - My students are allowed to access my location during the week if
   they are in possession of an authorization token.

   Furthermore it is necessary to specify policies even for access to
   the policies itself.  (But this MAY be out of scope of the Geopriv
   WG).

   Finally, it must be possible to cope with information stored in XML
   format.

         Figure 1: Interaction between the participating Entities

   Access control policies require a number of input parameters to
   compute the authorization decision. Some of these input parameters
   can be obtained from the request itself (i.e. from domain-specific
   input). To be accessible to the policy engine (as described in the
   policy rules) it is convenient to have the context request defined
   in an XACML schema.

   Based on Figure 2 of [XACML] the relationship to Geopriv is drawn.

                          Figure 2: XACML Context

   The access control engine evaluates incoming requests from specific
   subjects with specific actions (read, write, delete) for certain
   objects. For Geopriv some of these objects are location information
   "documents", as for example defined, in [CG03]. Location information
   is stored in XML documents.

   As shown in Figure 2 a native request is mapped into an XML request
   (following a XACML schema) which allows the access control engine
   and the policies to refer to certain items of the request. The XACML
   Context Request identifies, for example, which elements the subject
   wants to read. It provides information about the requesting entity
   such as role, subject identity, information about the security
   protocols used to authenticate, which credentials have been used,
   etc. The Geopriv group might want to evaluate which information
   items are typically associated with a request to re-evaluate the
   XACL Context schema definition.

   Note that attributes might appear in different envelopes such as
   X.509 attribute certificates or as Security Assertion Markup
   Language (SAML) assertions [SAML]. SAML allows distributing security
   information. Thereby the security information is expressed as
   assertions about subjects. These assertions carry information about
   authentication acts, attributes and authorization decisions.
   Conversion between the native format and the XACML context might be
   specified with the help of the Extensible Stylesheet Language
   Transformation [XSLT].

4.   Features provided by XACML

   This section describes some of the features which make it an
   attractive access control markup language for Geopriv policies.
   Implementing a new access control markup language solely for Geopriv
   without reusing existing systems requires recreating the same
   functions and concepts. It seems that the solution space for
   standardized languages is actually fairly small when designing a
   flexible access control mechanism for XML based documents.

4.1     Basic functionality of XACML

   Three top-level elements are defined in XACML [XACML]: <Rule>,
   <Policy> and <PolicySet>

   The policy language model is defined in [XACML], Section 3.3 (see
   also Figure 3 there).

   A <Rule> contains a Boolean expression and consists of the following
   components:

   - Target
   - Effect and
   - Condition

   The rule target defines a set of resources, subjects and actions to
   which the rule applies. The rule itself forms the basic building
   block for a Policy.

   The rule target consists of
   - Resources
   - Subjects and
   - Actions

   Subjects and resources might be internally structured. This allows
   referencing them via an XPath [XPath] or XPointer [XPointer]
   reference. Referring to resources could imply to
   - refer to the content of the identified node itself
   - refer to the content of the identified node and its immediate
   child nodes or
   - refer to the content of the identified node and all its descendant
   nodes.

   It is therefore also possible to base the authorization decision on
   data contained in the resource to which access requested.

   The effect describes the intended consequence of a "true"
   evaluation. Two values are defined "permit" and "deny".


Tschofenig, Cuellar    Expires - December 2003               [Page 6]

                    Geopriv Authorization Policies           June 2003



   The condition furthermore allows refining the applicability of a
   rule. This element is optional.

   Rules themselves are not exchanged between entities. Therefore
   <Rules> are always embedded into a <Policy>. A <Policy> consists of

   - a target
   - a rule-combining algorithm id
   - a set of rules and
   - obligations.

   <Policy> elements might additionally attach to an information
   resource itself. One application would be to attach the policy
   itself to Geopriv location object.

   Obligations allow to enforce certain actions that must be performed
   either instead or in addition to the actions that may be performed.
   This functionality simulates the idea of a provisional action as
   described in [Kudo00]. Provisions are attached to the access
   decision.

   An example for such an access decision might be a logging action or
   the encryption of the objects returned in response.

   A <PolicySet> again allows combining set of Policies together with
   the following elements:

   - a target
   - a policy-combining algorithm id
   - obligations.

4.2     Combining Algorithms

   The rule-combining algorithm identifier is used to implement
   conflict resolution (i.e. a mechanism for achieving a final
   authorization decision after evaluating individual rules) with the
   following standard algorithms:

   * Deny-overrides
   * Permit-overrides
   * First applicable and
   * Only-one-applicable

   The policy-combining algorithm identifier enforces the same concept
   as the rule-combining algorithm identifier but at a policy and not a
   rule level.

                    Geopriv Authorization Policies           June 2003


   An example: The permit-overrides algorithm causes a "permit"
   evaluation if a single rule (or policy) in the applicable policy is
   found with a "permit" evaluation, regardless of other rules or
   policies in the applicable policy.

   New rule-combining algorithms (or policy-combining algorithms) can
   be specified, if necessary.

4.3     Operators

   In order to compute an authorization decision it is necessary to
   perform operations on attributes of subjects and resources. XACML
   defines a number of operators:

   - Operators on numerical data types

   Examples: integer-add, double-add, integer-subtract, integer-
   multiply, double-mod, integer-divide, round, floor, integer-abs,
   double-to-integer, etc.

   Additionally arithmetic comparison functions are defined such as
   integer-less-than, double-greater-than-or-equal, etc.
   Various non-numeric comparison functions also exist such as string-
   greater-than, string-less-than, time-less-than, date-greater-than,
   etc.

   - Operators on date, time and duration data types

   Examples: dateTime-subtract-yearMonthDuration, dateTime-add-
   dayTimeDuration, date-subtract-yearMonthDuration

   - Operators on Boolean data types

   Examples: and, or, not, n-of

   These operators allow specifying logical combination of predicates
   of a rule.

   - Operators on sets

   Examples: type-bag-size, type-is-in, type-intersection, type-union,
   type-subset, type-set-equals, any-of, all-of, any-of-any, map, etc.

   - Relationship operators

   Examples: Equality and comparison on RFC 822 and X.500 name forms,
   strings, URIs, etc. (string-equal, Boolean-equal, integer-equal,
   date-equal, time-equal, X500Name-eqal, rfc822Name-equal, anyURI-
   equal, etc.)

   Additionally it is possible to add non-standard functions.

5.   Examples

   This section shows some examples for the XACML policies. For this
   version of the draft some very basic examples are provided.
   Currently the examples are very much aligned to the examples in
   Section 4 of [XACML]. Comments are inserted into the XML code within
   "<!--" and "-->".

5.1     Request Context Example 1

   The request in XACML for the first example might be stated as
   follows:

      "Jorge Cuellar wants to know (i.e. read) the location of Hannes
      Tschofenig. Jorge Cuellar is identified with an RFC 822 type of
      email address (for example obtained during the SIP authentication
      procedure)".

   This request therefore translates to the following XACML request
   context:

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <Request xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:context"
   xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   xsi:schemaLocation="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:context

   <!-- These lines show the header of the request context. -->

      <AttributeValue>Jorge.Cuellar@siemens.com</AttributeValue>
     </Attribute>
   </Subject>

   <!-- The <Subject> element describes information about the
   requesting entity. Multiple subjects and multiple attributes per
   subject are possible. -->

   <Resource>
    <Attribute
   AttributeId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:resource:ufs-path"
      DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#anyURI">

   <AttributeValue>/geopriv/HannesTschofenig@siemens.com</AttributeValu
   e>
     </Attribute>
   </Resource>

   <!-- The <Resource> element indicates to which resource access is
   requested. For this example it is assumed that the location
   information is stored in a directory oriented (pathname /geopriv/
   HannesTschofenig@siemens.com) fashion. To support compatibility it
   is required to agree on a common structure for referencing the
   required elements. -->

   <Action>
     <Attribute
   AttributeId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:action:action-id"
       DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">
      <AttributeValue>read</AttributeValue>
     </Attribute>
   </Action>
   </Request>

   <!-- The <Action> element describes the desired action. In this case
   a "read" action is requested to retrieve location information. -->

5.2    Policy Example 1

   The request described in Section 5.1 is then matched against a
   policy at the location server. This policy might, for example, be
   provided by the owner of the location itself.

   <?xml version=1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <Policy xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:policy"
   xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   xsi:schemaLocation="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:policy
   http://www.oasis-open.org/tc/xacml/1.0/cs-xacml-schema-policy-
   01.xsd"
   PolicyId="identifier:example:GeoprivPolicy1"
   RuleCombiningAlgId="identifier:rule-combining-algorithm:deny-
   overrides">

   <!-- This part of the policy represents header information
   containing information about the encoding, the URI to the XACML
   policy schema, a unique policy identifier and finally the rule
   combining algorithm identifier. The deny-overrides policy forces a
   "deny" to be returned when any of the policy rules evaluates to
   "deny". -->

   the subject-id of the requestor with "siemens.com". The
   <SubjectMatch MatchId=...> specifies how matching should be
   performed and what data types are expected. Furthermore it returns
   "Permit" only if the requested action is "read". No restrictions are
   made regarding the resources (i.e. any location information might be
   accessed). -->

5.3    Reponse Context Example 1

   The following XML text might represent a possible reponse context to
   the request described in this example.

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <Response xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:context"
   xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   xsi:schemaLocation="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:context
   http://www.oasis-open.org/tc/xacml/1.0/cs-xacml-schema-context-
   01.xsd">

   <!-- These lines show the header of the response context. -->

   <Result>
     <Decision>NotApplicable</Decision>
   </Result>

   <!-- These lines show the actual response after evaluation of the
   request against the policy rules. -->

   Refer to the threats doc here [DM+03].  There may be also some
   additional threats to the xacml solution.

7.   Open Issues

   This draft is a first discussion starter. As such it creates a
   number of open issues, such as:

   - What attributes are useful for location requests? What information
   should typically serve as input to the authorization engine?

   - As soon as the work on the location object makes progress it is
   necessary to describe how to access the attributes of the location
   object.

   - More sophisticated Geopriv example policies have to be added to
   test the adequacy of the capabilities of XACML.

   - Some data might not be available in form of a XML document - the
   data might be computed on the fly (e.g. location information at a
   different granularity). Another approach is to have all information
   already available and to access as any other data item. Some
   discussions might be required to determine the best approach
   possible.

   - How to structure access to location object information of
   different entities? As mentioned in [XCAP] it is necessary to define
   a schema for data used by a number of entities. One possible
   approach is to access individual data items with the help of URIs.
   In any case a naming convention for access to items of the location
   objects and other information items has to be created.



8.   Acknowledgments
