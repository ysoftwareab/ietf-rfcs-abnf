              SIP Communications Resource Priority Header

STATUS OF THIS MEMO

   This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with

Abstract

   This document defines a new SIP header field for communications
   resource priority, called "Resource-Priority". This header field
   influences the behavior of gateways and SIP proxies.

2 Introduction

   This document defines a new SIP [2] header field for communications
   resource priority, called "Resource-Priority". This header MAY be
   used by GSTN gateways and SIP proxy servers to influence their

   treatment of SIP requests, including the priority afforded to GSTN
   calls. For GSTN gateways, the behavior translates into the ITU
   Recommendation Q.735.3 [3] prioritization mechanism, in both GSTN-
   to-IP and IP-to-GSTN directions. For IP networks, proxies may offer
   mechanisms beyond the scope of this document to influence, for
   example, admission control or IP packet marking.

   The Resource-Priority header field may be inserted by proxies and SIP
   user agents.

   The Resource-Priority header field may be used in several situations:

        1.   Carrying information from one multi-level priority domain,
             e.g., using the facilities of Q.735.3 [3], to another,
             without the proxies themselves inspecting the header field.

        2.   Indicating signaling priority in SIP proxies and back-to-
             back user agents, with higher priorities displacing
             existing signaling requests or bypassing capacity limits in
             effect for lower priorities.

        3.   Requesting elevated priority for access to PSTN gateway
             resources such as trunk circuits.

   This header is related to, but differs in semantics from, the
   Priority header field (RFC 2543, Section 6.25). The Priority header
   field describes the priority that the SIP request should have to the
   receiving human or its agent. For example, it may be factored into
   decisions about call routing and acceptance. It does not influence
   the use of communications resources.

   SIP entities supporting this specification MUST be able to generate
   and process this header.

3 The Resource-Priority Header Field

   This document defines the Resource-Priority general header field.



        Resource-Priority _  "Resource-Priority" HCOLON Resource-value
        Resource-value    _  "critic-ecp" / "flash-override" /
                             "flash" / "immediate" / "priority" /
                             "routine" / extension-parameter


   As a response header, the value indicates the actual priority
   selected by the recipient. This priority value may be lower or higher

   than the request header value.

   If the header field is missing, the SIP request is treated as if it
   had the Resource-Priority value of "routine".

   The values are adopted from RFC 791 [4], omitting the levels "network
   control" and "internetwork control", as these are inappropriate here.

   The values are prioritized in the order "critic-ecp" (highest),
   "flash-override", "flash", "immediate", "priority" and "routine"
   (lowest). Additional values in the extension parameter are treated as
   "routine" by entities that do not understand the value.

   The value "critic-ecp" stands for "Critical and Emergency Call
   Processing" [4]. This value SHOULD only be utilized for Government
   Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS) [5] and similar
   government emergency preparedness or reactionary implementations.


   Header field       where  proxy  ACK  BYE  CAN  INV  OPT  REG
   _____________________________________________________________
   Resource-Priority    c     ar     -    -    -    o    -    -


   Proxies MAY downgrade the Resource-Priority of unauthenticated
   requests. Details are specific to each administrative domain and
   beyond the scope of this document. Proxies SHOULD NOT reject requests
   with such headers but instead downgrade the resource priority value.

   A proxy or user agent MAY return status code 503 (Service
   Unavailable) if there are insufficient resources at the resource
   priority level specified. The response MAY also include a Warning
   header with warning code 370 (Insufficient Bandwidth) if the request
   failed due to insufficient capacity for the media streams, rather
   than insufficient signaling capacity.

4 IANA Considerations

   Additional header field parameters can be registered with IANA. The
   registration MUST indicate the relative precedence level, expressed
   in relationship to existing adjacent values, e.g., "between urgent
   and normal".

5 Security Considerations

   The Resource-Priority header field can be abused to consume scarce
   communications resources. Thus, authentication of the requester is of
   particular importance. Authentication MAY be SIP-based.
