Abstract

     In this document, we propose a new multicast protocol called 
     MXcast (Multiple Xcast Packets). This protocol uses a very simple 
     method to deliver multicast packets without constructing 
     multicast trees using the Xcast [1] and xcast+ [2] techniques. 
   
1. Introduction

     Recently several multicast mechanisms were proposed that scale 
     better with the number of multicast sessions than traditional 
     multicast does[5].
     Explicit Multicast (Xcast)[1] is a newly proposed multicast scheme 
     to support a very large number of small multicast groups. Xcast+ 
     [2] is an enhanced scheme for the support of receiver initiated 
     join in explicit multicast which complements the existing Xcast. 
     This is achieved by adding an IGMP join at receiver side and 
     sending the join request through source-specific join to the sender,
     and then by explicitly encoding the list of addresses of the 
     multicast routers, instead of receiver addresses. 
     Xcast+ encoding of the destination list in IPv4 and IPv6 are the 
     same as Xcast. Whereas Xcast can support a very large number of 
     small multicast groups, Xcast+ can support a very large number of 
     medium size multicast groups.
     In all the newly proposed protocols the source knows the addresses
     of all the destinations before sending packets. 
     We think that when having medium group size the header processing 
     in every router for all packets travelling from the source to the 
     destinations is very expensive.

INTERNET-DRAFT                  MXcast                        March 2003

     This document describes a new protocol called MXcast which uses  
     an efficient method to forward multicast packets. 

     It uses the same mechanism of Xcast+ by using a small number of 

     destinations. But instead of encoding the list of addresses of the 
     multicast routers as in Xcast+, MXcast partitions the destination's 
     list into multiple lists containning each a fixed number of 
     destinations.
     MXcast encodes the lists in seperate packets and send them in Xcast 
     Mode.

     Using MXcast will result in the following benefits :

     -    From the viewpoint of receivers, procedures in the control
          plane are the same to existing ISM and SSM[7, 8] schemes. 
          Therefore, MXcast receivers do not need to use additional 
          control to join in MXcast session. This means that the control 
          plane of MXcast is compatible with the existing ISM and SSM. 
          A receiver that is an IGMP capable host does not need to be 
          an MXcast capable host.

     -    There can be an increase of the number of receivers, which
          means MXcast can support larger size number of 
          members compared to that of existing Xcast and Xcast+. 
          Comparing with Xcast and Xcast+, the packet header 
          processing in MXcast is minimised and thus, MXcast can support 
          larger size number of members.
          
     -    Similar to ALM (Application Level Multicast) and Overlay
          Multicast schemes, MXcast supports both multicast and unicast,
          where multicast is used in subnet and unicast is used between
          branching routers. Therefore, this will result in a more 
          efficient and scalable mechanism that allow to increase the 
          number of receivers in a subnet.

     -    When the scalability in ISM schemes is considered, one of the
          main issues may be complexity of multicast tree construction
          between multicast routers on Internet backbone. Because MXcast
          uses the multicast scheme in a subnet level only (the use of 
          the multicast address is so simple in all other cases) , 
          deployment and management are easy and simple, even if 
          multicast scheme is used.

2. MXcast Overview

     Suppose that B, C, D, E, F and G are trying to receive
     packets distributed from A in Figure 1 below:

                                B
                               /
                             R4 -- C
                            /                    D
                           /                    /
      A --- R1 --- R2 --- R3                    R8 -- E
                            \                  / \
                             \                /   F

INTERNET-DRAFT                  MXcast                        March 2003




                              R5 --- R6 --- R7

                                              \
                                               \
                                                R9 -- G

                                  Figure 1

     This is accomplished as follows:

     B, C, D, E, F and G initiate IGMP join. When R4, R8 and R9 receive
     the IGMP request, they send source-specific join to A. 
     If the number of destinations permited (DESTPERM) in an MXcast 
     header is 2 that mean that 2 MXcast packets should be sent to the 
     destinations. (Indeed, we have :
     (3 destinations)/ (DESTPERM = 2 destinations per packet) = 
     1.5 packets to be sent).
     
     The first packet contains R4 as the XCast destination. the 
     second packet contains only R8, R9 as the Xcast destinations.
     So instead of sending one Xcast packet with (R4, R8, R9) as the
     Xcast destination we send two Xcast (MXcast) packets.
     MXcast can be used not only for small groups but also to group
     with a large number of destinations. Indeed, comparing to unicast, 
     MXcast reduces at least by DESTPERM the unicast flow sent to n 
     destinations.
     It should be noted that the partition of the destination list into 
     multiple destination lists should be carefully considered. A good 
     choose of this partition will result in reducing the MXcast packets
     to be send in subsequents links. 
      

3. MXcast Packet format
     
     Each MXcast packet (same as an Xcast+ packet) is as follow:
    
       [ IP header | Group address | Transport header | Payload ]
    
    The IP header contains the source address and the destination 
    address of the next hop branch router.
    Join and leave messages could be normal SSM join and leave 
    messages. Thus, in order to not make confusion between SSM 
    and MXcast, an interval of addresses could specified to be 
    used only with MXcast protocol.
