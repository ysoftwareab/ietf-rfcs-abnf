1.  Introduction

   [RFC6513], [RFC6514], and [RFC6625] specify procedures for supporting
   multicast in Border Gateway Protocol/MultiProtocol Label Switching
   (BGP/MPLS) Layer 3 (IP) Virtual Private Network (VPN).  Throughout
   this document, we will use the term "Multicast VPN (MVPN)" [RFC6513]
   to refer to a BGP/MPLS IP VPN that supports multicast.

   Provider Edge routers (PEs) exchange the VPN customer multicast
   (C-multicast) routing information with each other.  In [RFC6513], two
   basic methods for exchanging C-multicast routing information are
   defined (1) Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) [RFC7761] and (2)
   BGP.

   In the rest of this document we will use the term "PIM-MVPN" to refer
   to PIM being used for exchanging C-multicast routing information, and

   "BGP-MVPN" to refer to BGP being used for exchanging C-multicast
   routing information.

   This document describes managed objects to configure and/or monitor
   MVPN.  The managed objects are common to both PIM-MVPN and BGP-MVPN.

   Comments should be made directly to the BESS WG at bess@ietf.org.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document adopts the definitions, acronyms and mechanisms
   described in [RFC6513] and other documents that [RFC6513] refers to.
   Familiarity with Multicast, MPLS, Layer 3 (L3) VPN, MVPN concepts
   and/or mechanisms is assumed.  Some terms specifically related to
   this document are explained below.

   MVPN can be achieved by using various kinds of transport mechanisms
   for forwarding a packet to all or a subset of PEs across service
   provider networks.  Such transport mechanisms are referred to as
   provider tunnels (P-tunnels).

   "Provider Multicast Service Interface (PMSI)" [RFC6513] is a
   conceptual interface instantiated by a provider tunnel (P-tunnel), a
   transport mechanism used to deliver multicast traffic.  A PE uses to
   send customer multicast traffic to all or some PEs in the same VPN.

   There are two kinds of PMSI: "Inclusive PMSI (I-PMSI)" and "Selective
   PMSI (S-PMSI)" [RFC6513].  An I-PMSI is a PMSI that enables a PE
   attached to a particular MVPN to transmit a message to all PEs in the
   same VPN.  An S-PMSI is a PMSI that enables a PE attached to a
   particular MVPN to transmit a message to some of the PEs in the same
   VPN.

   As described in [RFC4382], each PE router maintains one default
   forwarding table and "Virtual Routing and Forwarding tables", or
   "VRFs".  Throughout this document, we will use the term "multicast
   VRF (MVRF)" to refer a VRF that is configured to contain the
   multicast routing information.

   Interchangeably, the term MVRF and MVPN are used to refer to a
   particular Multicast VPN instantiation on a particular PE.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  MCAST-VPN-MIB

   This document defines MCAST-VPN-MIB, a MIB module for monitoring and/
   or configuring MVPNs on PEs.

3.1.  Summary of MIB Module

   MCAST-VPN-MIB provides the following functionalities for monitoring
   and configuring MVPN.

   o  Monitoring attribute informations of MVRFs of MVPNs presented on a
      PE

   o  Configuring some timers related to a MVRF

   o  Notifying creation, deletion, and modification of MVRFs on a PE

   o  Monitoring attribute informations of PMSIs on a PE

   o  Monitoring advertisement exchanged by a PE

   o  Monitoring routing entries in an MVRF

   o  Monitoring information on next-hops in an MVRF

   o  Notifying events that a PE joins or leaves a multicast group

   To provide these functionalities, MCAST-VPN-MIB defines nine tables:
   mvpnGenericTable, mvpnBgpGenericlTable, mvpnPmsiTable,
   mvpnSpmsiTable, mvpnIpmsiAdvtTable, mvpnInterAsIpmsiAdvtTable,
   mvpnSpmsiAdvtTable, mvpnMrouteTable, and mvpnMrouteNextHopTable.

Internet-Draft             L3VPN Multicast MIB                April 2018


   The following two tables contain information of MVRFs of MVPNs
   configured on a PE.

   o  mvpnGenericTable

      This table specifies the generic information about MVRFs present
      in a PE.  Each entry in this table is created for each MVRF
      representing an instance of MVPN.  The entry represetns general
      configuration/states of the MVRF, including Inclusive PMSI
      (I-PMSI) configuration.  An MVRF represented by the entry in this
      table must have a corresponding VRF in MPLS-L3VPN-STD-MIB
      [RFC4382].

   o  mvpnBgpGenericTable

      This table specifies the specific information of MVRFs of MVPNs
      that use BGP for exchanging C-Multicast routing information
      present in a PE.  Each MVRF of an MVPN that use BGP for exchanging
      C-Multicast routing information will have an entry in this table.
      The MVRF represented by this entry will have a corresponding entry
      in the mvpnGenericTable.

   The following two tables contain information of PMSIs configured on a
   PE.

   o  mvpnPmsiTable

      This table contains common managed objects representing attribute
      information of both I-PMSI and Selective PMSI (S-PMSI) configured
      on a PE.  Both I-PMSI information (in the entry in
      mvpnGeneralTable) and S-PMSI information (in the entry in
      mvpnSpmsiConfigTable) refer to an entry in this table.

   o  mvpnSpmsiTable

      This table contains managed objects representing attribute
      information that is specific for S-PMSI associated with an MVRF on
      a PE.

   The following three tables are designed for monitoring advertisements
   that is advertised/received by a PE.

   o  mvpnIpmsiAdvtTable

      This table contains managed objects representing advertisements of
      Intra-AS I-PMSIs advertised/received by a PE.

   o  mvpnInterAsIpmsiAdvtTable

      This table contains managed objects representing advertisements of
      Inter-AS I-PMSIs advertised/received by a PE.

   o  mvpnSpmsiAdvtTable

      This table contains managed objects representing advertisements of
      S-PMSIs advertised/received by a PE.

   The following two tables are designed for handling routing
   information that is advertised/received by a PE.

   o  mvpnMrouteTable

      This table contains multicast routing information in MVRFs present
      in a PE.

   o  mvpnMrouteNextHopTable

      The table contains information on the next-hops on outgoing
      interfaces for routing IP multicast datagrams in MVPNs present on
      a PE.

4.  Security Considerations

   This MIB contains some read-only objects that may be deemed senstive
   by some though perhaps not all operators.  It also contains some
   read- write objects, whose setting will change the device's behavior
   related to MVPN.  Appropriate security procedures related to SNMP in
   general but not specific to this MIB need to be implemented by
   concerned operators.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network



Zhang, et al.           Expires November 1, 2018               [Page 62]

Internet-Draft             L3VPN Multicast MIB                April 2018


   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection opens devices to attack.  These
   are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  mvpnGenCmcastRouteProtocol, mvpnGenIpmsiInfo,
      mvpnGenInterAsPmsiInfo, mvpnGenUmhSelection,
      mvpnGenCustomerSiteType, mvpnGenSPTunnelLimit, mvpnBgpGenMode,
      mvpnBgpGenVrfRtImport, mvpnPmsiEncapsulationType,
      mvpnSpmsiThreshold, mvpnSpmsiPmsiPointer

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  [TBD]

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to root MIB objects in the MIB module contained in
   this document under the mib-2 subtree.
