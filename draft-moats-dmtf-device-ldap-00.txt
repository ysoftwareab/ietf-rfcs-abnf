Abstract

   This draft presents a LDAP schema for the DMTF CIM Device model [7].

1. Introduction

   This draft presents a LDAPv3 [1,2] schema for the DMTF CIM Device
   model.  It builds on the core model presented in [3].  Associations
   are mapped using a combination of auxiliary classes and DIT structure
   rules.  Where auxiliary classes are used, name form and DIT content
   rules are specified.

   Certain objects in the CIM Device model have not been represented in
   this schema.  The classes IRQ, MemoryMappedIO, and DMA are not
   included because they do not make sense for storage in a directory.
   Therefore, the associations ComputerSystemIRQ,
   ComputerSystemMappedIO, ComputerSystemDMA, and AllocatedDMA are also

   not included.

   The objects and associations VideoBIOSFeature, VideoBIOSElement, and
   VideoBIOSFeatureVideoBIOSElement are not included.

   PrintQueue and PrintJob are not included because of thier inherent
   dynacism.  This results in the associations PrinterServicingQueue,
   QueueForPrintService, QueueForwardsToPrintSAP, PrinterServicingJob,
   PrintJobFile, and OwningPrintQueue not being included.

   All of the sensor classes (BinarySensor, MultiStateSensor,
   DiscreteSensor, NumericSensor, TempatureSensor, CurrentSensor,
   VoltageSensor, Tachometer) were deemed too dynamic for a directory.
   Therefore, the associations CollectionOfSensors,
   AssociatedSupplyVoltageSensor, and AssociatedSupplyCurrentSensor are
   also not included.

   Because FCAdapterEventCounters and FibrePortEventCounters have
   nothing but counters in them, they are not included in the schema.
   Further, because USBDevice claims to be only management, it is not
   included in this schema and so USBHub, USBPortOnHub,
   USBControllerHasHub, and USBConnection are not included.

   Processor and ComputerSystemProcessor are not included because they
   do not make sense in a directory.  The StorageExtent-related classes
   and media transfer classes were not included for similar reasons.

2. Class Definitions

   For efficiency in the LDAP representation, associations are specified
   as a combination of auxiliary classes and DIT structure rules.
   Attribute definitions for each class are presented with the object
   class.  Other definitions are also provided when necessary.

   While this approach was chosen to minimize the number of DN pointers
   stored in the schema, some pointer dereferencing is necessary.  While
   not explicitly stated, all DN pointers are assumed to support the
   extended matching rule defined in [4].  Attribute names for DN
   pointers follow the convention that a single pointer to "foo" is
   named "fooRef" while an array of pointers would be named "fooRefs."

   Note: all OIDs are placeholders, and OIDs in definitions have been
   replaced by names for clarity.

2.1 dmtfDeviceConnectionAuxClass Association

   The class shows that two or more devices are connected together and
   so both antecedentRefs and dependentRefs point to dmtfLogicalDevice

   objects.  Further, it defines the attributes negotiatedSpeed (the
   speed between the two devices), and negotiatedDataWidth (the data
   width between the two devices).

        DESC 'When several bus and/or connection speeds are possible, the
              NegotiatedSpeed property defines the one in use between the
              Devices. Speed is specified in bits per second. If
              connection or bus speeds are not negotiated, or if this
              information is not available/important to Device
              management, the property should be set to 0.'
        SYNTAX integer SINGLE-VALUE
      )

      ( <oid-at83> NAME 'negotiatedDataWidth'
        DESC 'When several bus and/or connection data widths are
              possible, the NegotiatedDataWidth property defines the one
              in use between the Devices. Data width is specified in

        MUST (negotiatedSpeed $ negotiatedDataWidth)
      )

2.2 dmtfDeviceIdentityAuxClass

   This association shows that two logical devices represent different
   aspects of the same underlying entity.  This association refines the
   logical identity superclass by restricting it to the device level and
   defining its use in well understood scenarios. One of these scenarios
   is to represent that a device is both a 'bus' entity and a
   'functional' entity. For example, a device could be both a PCI device
   (or an USB device), as well as a keyboard. The other scenario is a
   device having multiple functional roles that can not be distinguished
   by their hardware realization alone. For example, a Fiber Channel
   adapter might have aspects of both a NetworkAdapter and a
   SCSIController.  In this class, the attributes systemElementRefs and
   sameElementRefs both point to dmtfLogicalDevice Objects.

      ( <oid-oc53> NAME 'dmtfDeviceIdentityAuxClass'
        DESC 'shows that two LogicalDevices represent different
              aspects of the same underlying entity.'

2.3 dmtfSystemResource Class

   This class provides the parent class for any entity that is both
   available for use by software and/or logical devices.  It defines the
   attribute sharable, which is documented below.

      ( <oid-at84> NAME 'sharable'
        DESC 'Boolean showing whether the Resource can be shared.'
        SYNTAX boolean SINGLE-VALUE

              is available for use by software and/or
              LogicalDevices.'
        SUP  dmtfLogicalElement ABSTRACT
        MUST (sharable)
      )

2.4 dmtfComputerResouceAuxClass Association

   This is a subclass of the dmtfSystemComponentAuxClass association. In
   it, groupRefs must point to a dmtfComputerSystem object and partRefs
   must point to a dmtfSystemResource object.

      ( <oid-oc55> NAME 'dmtfComputerSystemResourceAuxClass'
        DESC 'An association between a ComputerSystem and the
              SystemResources available on it.'
        SUP  dmtfSystemComponentAuxClass AUXILIARY
      )

2.5 dmtfAllocatedResourceAuxClass

   This subclass of dmtfDependencyAuxClass represents the association
   between logical devices and system resources.  The association is
   that the resource is assigned to the device.  In this association,
   antecedentRefs points to a dmtfSystemResource object and
   dependentRefs point to a dmtfLogicalDevice object.

      ( <oid-oc56> NAME 'dmtfAllocatedResourceAuxClass'

2.6 dmtfDeviceServiceImplementationAuxClass

   This class represents the association between a Service and how it is
   implemented. The cardinality of this association is many-to-many. A
   service may be provided by more than one logical device, operating in
   conjunction. Further, any device may provide more than one service.
   When multiple devices are associated with a single service, it is
   assumed that these elements operate in conjunction to provide the
   service. If different implementations of a service exist, each of
   these implementations would result in individual instantiations of
   the service object. These individual instantiations would then have
   associations to the unique implementations.  In this class,
   antecedentRefs point to dmtfLogicalDevice objects and dependentRefs
   point to dmtfService objects.

      ( <oid-oc57> NAME 'dmtfDeviceServiceImplementationAuxClass'
        DESC 'An association between a Service and how it is implemented.'
        SUP  dmtfDependencyAuxClass AUXILIARY
      )

2.7 dmtfDeviceSAPImplementationAuxClass

   An association between a service access point and how it is
   implemented. The cardinality of this association is many-to-many. A
   SAP may be provided by more than one logical device, operating in
   conjunction. Further, any device may provide more than one service
   access point. When many logical devices are associated with a single
   SAP, it is assumed that these elements operate in conjunction to
   provide the access point. If different implementations of a SAP
   exist, each of these implementations would result in individual
   instantiations of the service access point object. These individual
   instantiations would then have associations to the unique
   implementations.  In this class, antecedentRefs point to
   dmtfLogicalDevice objects and dependentRefs point to
   dmtfServiceAccessPoint objects.

      ( <oid-oc58> NAME 'dmtfDeviceSAPImplementationAuxClass'
        DESC 'An association between a ServiceAccessPoint and how it is
              implemented.'
        SUP  dmtfDependencyAuxClass AUXILIARY
      )

2.8 dmtfDeviceErrorCounts object

   This object represents a statistical class containing error-related
   counters for a logical device. The types of errors are as defined by
   CCITT (Rec X.733) [5] and ISO (IEC 10164-4) [6].  This class reuses
   the attributes deviceCreationClassName, systemCreationClassName,

        MUST (systemCreationClassName $ systemName $
              deviceCreationClassName $ deviceID $ name)
      )

   Although systemCreationClassName, systemName,
   deviceCreationClassName, deviceID and name all may be used as RDNs,
   it is recommended that this class be stored in the DIT according to
   the following structural rule and name forms.

      ( 21 NAME 'dmtfErrorCountersForDeviceStructureRule'
        FORM dmtfStatsNameForm

        OC dmtfStats
        MUST (name)
      )

2.9 dmtfDeviceSoftwareAuxClass

   This relationship identifies any software that is associated with a
   device - such as drivers, configuration or application software, or
   firmware.  In this class, antecedentRefs point to dmtfSoftwareElement
   objects and dependentRefs point to dmtfLogicalDevice objects.  This
   class further defines the attributes purpose, purposeDescription,
   loadedOnDevice, and upgradeableOnDevice to explain the role of the
   software regarding the device.

      ( <oid-at85> NAME 'purpose'
        DESC 'An enumerated integer to show the role this software
              plays regarding its associated Device. For example,
              this software could be instrumentation (value=5) or

2.10 dmtfRedundancyGroup Class

   This class is derived from dmtfLogicalElement and represents a
   special collection of managed system elements that together provide
   redundancy.  Therefore, all elements aggregated in this class should
   be from the same object class. This class uses the attributes
   creationClassName, name and defines the attribute redundancyStatus.

      ( <oid-at89> NAME 'redundancyStatus'
        DESC 'RedundancyStatus provides information on the state of the

2.11 dmtfRedundancyComponentAuxClass

   A redundancy group aggregates managed system elements and shows that
   these elements, taken together, provide redundancy. All elements
   aggregated in a redundancy group should be instantiations of the same
   object class. In this class, groupRefs points to dmtfRedundancyGroup
   objects while partRefs maintains its default definition from
   dmtfComponentAuxClass.

2.12 dmtfSpareGroup

   Derived from RedundancyGroup, this class shows that one or more of
   the aggregated elements act as spares for the others. An example is
   the use of redundant NICs in a computer system - where one NIC is
   primary and the other is spare.

2.13 dmtfActsAsSpareAuxClass

   This auxiliary class shows those elements can spare or replace the
   other aggregated elements.  Whether a spare can operate in "hot
   standby" mode is specified on an element by element basis. In this
   class groupRefs points to the dmtfSpareGroup object, spareRefs points
   to the managed system element acting as a spare and hotStandby shows
   if the spare is operating as a hotStandby or not.

2.14 dmtfStorageRedundancyGroup

   This class is derived from redundancy group and contains mass
   storage-related redundancy information. Storage redundancy groups are
   used to protect user data. They are made up of one or more physical
   extents, or one or more dmtfAggregatePExtents. While storage
   redundancy groups may overlap, the underlying extents within the
   overlap should not contain any check data.  The attributes
   typeOfAlgorithm, storageRedundancy, isStriped and isConcatenated are
   defined.

   A class derived from dmtfRedundancyGroup indicating that the
   aggregated elements have more capacity or capability than is needed.
   An example of this type of redundancy is the installation of N+1
   power supplies or fans in a system.  This class defines the attribute
   minNumberNeeded, which shows the smallest number of elements that

2.16 dmtfLogicalPort

   This class represents the abstraction of a port or connection point
   of a device.  This object should be instantiated when the Port has
   independent management characteristics from the Device that includes

2.66 dmtfFibrePortOnFCAdapterAuxClass

   This auxiliary class associates a fibre port with a fibre channel
   adapter. Cardinalities are defined to show the intent and usage of
   the model, that an Adapter is synonymous with its Port (connection
   point). Therefore, antecedentRefs may only point to a single
   dmtfFibreChannelAdapter objects and dependentRefs may only point to a
   single dmtfFibrePort object.

   Where more than one Port may be active at a time, individual Adapters
   with individual operating data and characteristics really exist. If
   there are multiple connection points, but they exist only to provide
   multiple physical form factors (only one connection may be active at
   a time), then one fibre channel adapter and one fibre port (the
   active one) exist. On the hardware side, the realizations of these
   entities in dmtfPhysicalElement objects may be as a dmtfCard (for
   example) with multiple dmtfPhysicalConnectors.
