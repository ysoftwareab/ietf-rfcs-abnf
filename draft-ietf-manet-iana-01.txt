1.  Introduction

   This document enumerates a port and several scoped multicast address
   assignments for MANET protocols.


2.  UDP Port for MANET Protocols

   To aggregate MANET routing protocol traffic it must be sent to the
   same IP destination address and the same port.  Therefore, all
   interoperable MANET routing protocol traffic should be sent to the
   same UDP port.  The title of this UDP port is "MANET".  In order to
   be interoperable all packets sent to this port MUST conform to the
   packetbb specification [I-D.ietf-manet-packetbb].

                            UDP Port Assignment

                             +-------+-------+
                             |  Name | Value |
                             +-------+-------+
                             | MANET |  TBD1 |
                             +-------+-------+

                                  Table 1


3.  Link-local Multicast Group for MANET Routers

   MANET protocols need a link-local multicast address [RFC4291] to
   disseminate information.

   The name of the multicast address to reach link-local (LL) MANET
   routers is "LL MANET Routers".  MANET routers subscribe to this LL
   scoped multicast address and use it for LL transmissions of routing
   protocol packets.

   For IPv4, a statically assigned, link-local scope multicast address
   is used.  The address for LL MANET Routers is 224.0.0.TBD2 to appear
   in the [IANAv4Multicast] registry.

   For IPv6, a statically assigned, link-local scope multicast address
   is used.  The address for LL MANET Routers is FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:TBD3
   to appear in the [IANAv6Multicast] registry.

                  Link-local multicast address assignment

        +------------------+--------------+-----------------------+
        |       Name       |     IPv4     |          IPv6         |
        +------------------+--------------+-----------------------+
        | LL MANET Routers | 224.0.0.TBD2 | FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:TBD3 |
        +------------------+--------------+-----------------------+

                                  Table 2


4.  Site-local Scoped Multicast Groups for MANET Routers

   MANET protocols need a scoped multicast address [RFC4291] to
   disseminate information more widely, greater than LL.  This section
   names the multicast address, defines the scope, and clarifies router
   behavior.

   The name of the multicast address to reach the MANET routers is
   "MANET Routers".  MANET routers subscribe to these site-local scoped
   multicast addresses.

                  Site-local multicast address assignment

    +---------------+------------------------+-----------------------+
    |      Name     |          IPv4          |          IPv6         |
    +---------------+------------------------+-----------------------+
    | MANET Routers | 239.255.255.(255-TBD4) | FF05:0:0:0:0:0:0:TBD3 |
    +---------------+------------------------+-----------------------+

                                  Table 3

   MANET routers that forward these scoped multicast addresses must use
   additional criteria as specified in [RFC2365] and [RFC4007].

4.1.  Site-local Multicast Group for IPv4

   For IPv4, statically assigned, scope-relative multicast address (as
   defined by [RFC2365], Section 9) are used.  The offset for the scope
   relative address for scoped MANET Routers is TBD4 to appear in
   [IANAv4Multicast] registry.

   Different scopes are defined by [RFC2365].  The IPv4 Local Scope
   (239.255.0.0/16) is the minimal enclosing scope for administratively
   scoped multicast and not further divisible -- its exact extent is
   site dependent.

   For the IPv4 Local Scope, applying the rules of [RFC2365] and using

   the assigned offset of TDB4, the multicast address is therefore
   239.255.255.(255-TBD4).

4.2.  Site-local Scoped Multicast Group for IPv6

   IPv6 has different address ranges for different multicast scopes that
   are implemented as a set of address prefixes for the different
   address ranges ([RFC4291]).  A permanently assigned multicast address
   is used for site-local scoped MANET Routers multicast communication.
   See [RFC4291] and the [IANAv6Multicast] registry for IPv6 multicast
   assignments.

   The permanent IPv6 multicast address for MANET Routers/IPv6 is
   FF05:0:0:0:0:0:0:TBD3.
