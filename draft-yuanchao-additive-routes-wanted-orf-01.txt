Abstract 
    
   This document describes a solution for overcoming the limitations 
   of existing route reflect mechanism:even there are equal 
   routes,route reflector(RR) would use the nexthop router ID to 
   break tie and only reflect the route with lower router ID to its

   clients,so RR clients send all the traffic for the destination to 
   only one nexthop which leads to traffic unbalanced in an AS. 
   Additive-Routes-Wanted ORF extends ORF to not only filter BGP 
   routes but also give RR client the ablility to ask RR for additive 
   BGP routes in its BGP database. With the additive routes, RR 
   clients could make inner-AS native IP and VPNV4 load sharing 
   easier.

2.   Terminology 
    
   This document uses terminology described in [ORF], [BGP-4]  and 
   [MP-BGP]. 
    
3.   Introduction 
    
      The Outbound Route Filtering Capability defined in [ORF] 
   provides a mechanism for a BGP speaker to send to its BGP peer a 
   set of Outbound Route Filters (ORFs) that can be used by its peer 
   to filterits outbound routing updates to the speaker. 
    
      This document defines a new ORF-Type for BGP-4, termed " 
   Additive-Routes-Wanted Outbound Route Filter (Additive Routes 
   ORF)", which can be used by RR clients to ask RR for additive 
   routes.  After receive the additive routes from RR,RR clients use 
   iBGP multipath load Sharing to balance the traffic in an AS. 
       
      The Additive Routes ORF-Type inherits exsiting ORF encoding and 
   matching mechanism. 
    
    
4.   Additive Routes ORF 
    
   The Additive Routes ORF-Type acturally use the BGP capabilities 
   exchanging mechanism for ORF to ask RR for additive BGP routes. 
   The Additive Routes ORF-Type inherits existing ORF encoding and 
   matching method and have no need to define a new one.

   For example,if RR and clients both support Address Prefixe ORF-
   Type(RFC 5292),then clients may send a Additive Routes ORF-Type 
   consisting of the following fields with ORF-Type set to 65 but not 
   64:   <Sequence, Match, Length, Prefix, Minlen, Maxlen>. 
    
    
   After receives Additive Routes ORF,not like normal ORF-Type 
   looking up routes in routing table,RR looks up routes in its BGP 
   database and then advertises matched(according to the rules in ORF) 
   routes to clients throught BGP updates.In the case of  
   hierarchical RRs,it is necessary that Additive Routes ORF be used 
   between RRs and between RR and clients. 
     
   It is suggested that ORF would support (extended)communities and 
   AS-path regular expressions based encoding and matching method for 
   convenience,which is out of the scope of this document.    
    
5.   Additive Routes ORF Encoding 
    
      The value of the ORF-Type for the Additive Routes ORF-Type is 
   65. 
      An Additive Routes ORF entry is encoded in the same manner as 
   normal ORF-Type. 
    
6.   Additive Routes ORF Matching 
    
      An Additive Routes ORF entry is matched in the same manner as 
   normal ORF-Type. 
    
7.   IANA Considerations 
    
      This document specifies a new Outbound Route Filtering (ORF) 
   type, 
      Additive Route ORF.  The value of the ORF-Type is 65. 
    
8.   Security Considerations 
    
   This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security 
   issues in [BGP-4].
