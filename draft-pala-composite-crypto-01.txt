                  Composite Public Keys and Signatures
                     draft-pala-composite-crypto-01

Abstract

   PKIs are used to provide scalability and ease key management.  One
   type of PKIs that is predominant for securing communications and data
   is based on the X.509 standard.  Since the security of PKIs,
   ultimately, depends on the security of the cryptographic building
   blocks that are used for authentication and encryption, the standards
   community made algorithm agility a priority.  Algorithm agility, in
   particular, enables upgrading to newly available algorithms when
   needed.

   The CompositeCrypto (i.e., CompositeKey and CompositeSignature
   structures) described in this document provides an additional tool
   that enables the use of multiple algorithms to authenticate data
   without the need to use multiple certificates and more complex data
   structures.

   This document provide the description of the definition and encoding
   rules for CompositeKey and CompositeSignature.  A description of how
   to use these structures in main PKIX objects (e.g., X.509
   certificates, CRLs, OCSP responses, etc.) is also provided.

2.  Introduction and Scope

   With the definition of new algorithms (e.g. more efficient factoring
   techniques) and technologies (e.g., quantum-based computing devices)
   that might be available in the near future, the need to provide an
   easy-to-deploy and efficient solution capable of providing multi-
   algorithms authentication is paramount.

   Today there are no complete or general solutions that allow the use
   of multiple public-key algorithms to authenticate PKIX data without
   using multiple X.509 certificates or complex data structures.  For
   example, CRLs or OCSP responses can not be protected via multiple
   algorithms without wrapping the OCSP responses' data via CMS or other
   signed containers.

   We define two new building blocks, i.e. compositeKey and
   compositeSignature, that can be used in many environments where
   Public Key authentication is used - i.e., from the generation of
   certificates that are authenticated with multiple signatures (i.e.,
   using multiple keys that may or may not use different cryptographic
   schemes or different number of security bits), to the possibility of
   specifying a composite key that combines multiple public keys
   together (instead of one) in a single certificate.

   This document describes the encoding of the new building blocks and
   their application to different X.509 core data structures that are
   used in PKIs.  In particular, this document focuses only on the
   definition of the composite keys and composite signatures definitions
   for X.509 based PKIs (PKIX) by providing the encoding rules and their
   usage in existing X.509 (PKIX) data structures.

3.  Composite Cryptography

   Composite Cryptography is defined as the possibility to combine
   different public keys and signatures in PKIX objects.  The following
   OID is defined to identfy the algorithm class:

   id-pk-compositeCrypto OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1)
         identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1) private(4)
         enterprise(1) OpenCA(18227) Algorithms(2) 1 }

   Composite Cryptography provides three distinct building blocks: the
   compositePublicKey, the compositePrivateKey and the
   compositeSignature.  The compositePublicKey is meant to carry all the
   public keys associated with an identity.  The compositePrivateKey is
   meant to carry all the private keys associated with an identity.  The
   compositeSignature, instead, carries a sequence of signatures that

   are generated by using the different individual keys from a
   compositePrivateKey.

3.1.  Composite Public Keys

   This document defines a new Object Identifier for the compositeKey
   algorithm (e.g., similar to to the 'rsaEncryption' OID when using RSA
   public keys).

  id-pk-compositePublicKey OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-kp-compositeCrypto 1 }

  compositePrivateKey ::= SEQUENCE (1..MAX) OF BITSTRING

3.2.  Composite Private Keys

   This section specifies a syntax and semantics for Composite Keys
   private key information.  Composite private key information includes
   a sequence of private keys and parameters.  Additionally, it may
   include the corresponding public keys.  The structure defined in this
   document allows for the distribution of the composite keys (public
   and private) and the associated domain parameters by using a sequence
   of OneAsymmetricKey as defined in [RFC5958].  The Algorithm
   Identifier and data structure associated with composite private keys
   is defined as follows:

  id-pk-compositePrivateKey OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-kp-compositeCrypto 2 }

  compositePrivateKey ::= SEQUENCE (1..MAX) OF OneAsymmetricKey

3.2.1.  Encoding Rules

   When encoding Composite Private Keys, generators SHOULD use
   Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) [X.690] and receivers SHOULD be
   prepared to handle Basic Encoding Rules (BER) [X.690] and DER
   [X.690].

3.2.2.  Encrypted and Un-encrypted Local Storage

   The compositePrivateKeys format as defined in the previous subsection
   can also be used for local storage of an unencrypted
   compositePrivateKeys binary object.  The compositePrivateKeys can
   also be formatted in PEM format that uses the (".pem") file extension
   and which is encoded as the the Base64 encoding (see Section 4 of
   [RFC4648]), of the DER-encoded compositePrivateKeys object with the
   following armour:

     -----BEGIN COMPOSITE PRIVATE KEY-----
     -----END COMPOSITE PRIVATE KEY-----

Internet-Draft                     CKS                        March 2019


   Local storage of an encrypted CompositePrivateKeys object is out of
   scope of this document.  However, CompositePrivateKeys should be the
   format for the plaintext key being encrypted.  DER [X.690] encoding
   the CompositePrivateKeys will promote interoperability if the key is
   encrypted for transport to another party.  PEM encoding the DER-
   encoded CompositePrivateKeys is common; "Proc-Type:" and "DEK-INFO:"
   fields [RFC1421] followed by the DER-encoded CompositePrivateKeys.
   The following armour used in this case is as follows:

     -----BEGIN COMPOSITE PRIVATE KEY-----
     -----END COMPOSITE PRIVATE KEY-----

3.2.3.  Asymmetric Key Packages

   The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS), as defined in RFC 5652, can
   be used to digitally sign, digest, authenticate, or encrypt the
   asymmetric key format content type.  When encoding Composite Private
   Keys, the privateKeyAlgorithm in the OneAsymmetricKey SHALL be set to
   id-kp-compositePrivateKey.  The parameters of the privateKeyAlgorithm
   SHALL be a sequence of AlgorithmIdentifier objects, each of which are
   encoded according to the rules defined for each of the different keys
   in the Composite Private Key.  The value of the privateKey field in
   the OneAsymmetricKey SHALL be set to the DER encoding of the SEQUENCE
   of private key values that make up the composite key.  The number and
   order of elements in the sequence SHALL be the same as identified in
   the sequence of parameters in the privateKeyAlgorithm.  The value of
   the the publicKey (if present) SHALL be set to the DER encoding of
   the SEQUENCE of publicKey values.  If this field is present, the
   number and order of elements SHALL be the same as identified in the
   sequence of parameters in the privateKeyAlgorithm.  The value of the
   attributes is encoded as usual.

3.3.  Composite Signatures

  id-pk-compositeSignature OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { compositeCrypto 3 }

  compositeSignature OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= SEQUENCE (1..MAX) OF BITSTRING

3.4.  Generating compositeSignatures

   The use of composite signatures allows for the use of multiple
   algorithms for authentication.  When generating a compositeSignature,
   the signing entity MUST generate one signature per key that is in the
   corresponding compositePrivateKey set.

   The final value of the compositeSignature is the DER encoding of the
   SEQUENCE of BIT STRING where each BIT STRING is the DER

   representation of the signature generated with one of the private key
   in the compositePrivateKey set.

   The order of the signature MUST respect the order of keys in the
   compositePrivateKey and compositePublicKey sets.

3.5.  Verifying compositeSignatures

   When validating a compositeSignature, the relying party MUST verify
   at least one of the signatures in the compositeSignature structure
   and SHOULD verify all of them.

   The process of validating composite signatures starts with going
   through the sequence of the signatures

      For each

   The order of the signature MUST respect the order of keys in the
   compositePrivateKey and compositePublicKey sets.

4.  Use of Composite Crypto in PKIX structures

4.1.  Use in X.509 Certificates

4.2.  Use in X.509 CRLs

4.3.  Use in X.509 OCSP Messages

4.4.  Use in PKCS#7

4.5.  Use in PKCS#8

4.6.  Use in PKCS#12

4.7.  Use in CMS

5.  Security Considerations

   This structures described in this document do not protect the private
   keys information in any way unless combined with a security protocol
   or encryption properties of the objects (if any) where the
   CompositePrivateKey is used (see next Section).  Protection of the
   private key information is vital to public key cryptography.  The
   consequences of disclosure depend on the purpose of the private key.
   If a private key is used for signature, then the disclosure allows
   unauthorized signing.  If a private key is used for key management,
   then disclosure allows unauthorized parties to access the managed

   keying material.  The encryption algorithm used in the encryption
   process must be as 'strong' as the key it is protecting.

6.  IANA considerations

   The CMS content type OID is registered in a DoD arc.  The ASN.1
   module OID is TBD.  The id-pk-compositeCrypto, id-pk-
   compositePrivateKey, id-pk-compositePublicKey, and id-pk-
   compositeSignature OIDs are to be assigned by IANA.  The authors
   suggest to use the id-pkix arc for this usage.
