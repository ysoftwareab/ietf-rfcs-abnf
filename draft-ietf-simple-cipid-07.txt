Abstract

   The Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) defines a basic XML
   format for presenting presence information for a presentity.  The
   Contact Information for Presence Information Data Format (CIPID) is
   an extension that adds elements to PIDF that provide additional
   contact information about a presentity and its contacts, including
   references to address book entries and icons.

1.  Introduction

   In its function of facilitating communication, the usefulness of
   presence information can be enhanced by providing basic information
   about a presentity or contact.  This specification describes a basic
   set of information elements that allow a watcher to retrieve
   additional information about a presentity or contact.

   This specification defines extensions to the PIDF [7] (Presence
   Information Data Format) XML (Extensible Markup Language) [8]
   document format.

   We describe elements for providing a "business card", references to
   the homepage, map, representative sound, display name and an icon.
   This additional presence information can be used in PIDF [7]
   documents, together with RPID [9] (Rich Presence Information Data
   format), future-status [10] and other PIDF extensions.

   All elements extend the <person> or, less commonly, <tuple> element
   in the presence data model [11].  The <tuple> element is only
   extended with CIPID elements if the information describes a service
   referring to another person that is marked by an RPID <relationship>
   element with a value other than 'self'.  All elements described in
   this document are optional.

   RPID and CIPID both provide "rich" presence that goes beyond the
   basic 'open' and 'closed' status information in PIDF.  The presence
   information described in these two documents can be supplied
   independently, although in practice, both will often appear in the
   same PIDF document.  CIPID elements describe the more static aspects
   of somebody's presence information, while RPID focuses on elements
   that will likely change throughout the day.  Thus, CIPID information
   can often be statically configured by the user through the graphical
   user interface of a presence client, while this is less likely to be
   sufficient for RPID.

   The namespace URI for these elements defined by this specification is
   a URN [2], using the namespace identifier 'ietf' defined by [4] and
   extended by [6]:


      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:cipid


2.  Terminology and Conventions

   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT,
   RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be interpreted

   as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1].

3.  CIPID Elements

   Unless otherwise noted below, each element may only appear at most
   once.

3.1  Card Element

   The <card> element includes a URI pointing to a business card, e.g.,
   in LDIF [13] or vCard [12] format.

3.2  Display-Name Element

   The <display-name> element includes the name identifying the tuple or
   person that the presentity suggests should be shown by the watcher
   user interface.  It is left to the watcher user interface design to
   choose whether to heed this suggestion or use some other suitable
   string.  The CIPID information MAY contain multiple display names,
   but only if they are labeled with different 'xml:lang' attributes.
   This allows a Korean-speaking presentity to convey its display name
   in different Latin and Hangul, for example.

3.3  Homepage Element

   The <homepage> element provides a URI pointing to general information
   about the tuple or person, typically a web home page.

3.4  Icon Element

   The <icon> element provides a URI pointing to an image (icon)
   representing the tuple or person.  The watcher can use this
   information to represent the tuple or person in a graphical user
   interface.  Presentities SHOULD provide images of sizes and aspect
   ratios that are appropriate for rendering as an icon.  Support for
   JPEG, PNG and GIF formats is REQUIRED.

3.5  Map Element

   The <map> element provides a URI pointing to a map related to the
   tuple or person.  The watcher can use this information to represent
   the tuple or person in a graphical user interface.  The map may be
   either an image, an HTML client-side image map or a geographical
   information system (GIS) document, e.g., encoded as GML.  Support for
   images formatted as PNG and GIF is REQUIRED.

3.6  Sound Element

   The <sound> element provides a URI pointing to a sound related to the
   tuple or person.  The watcher MAY use the sound object, such as a
   MIDI or MP3 file, referenced by the URL to inform the watcher that
   the presentity has assumed the status OPEN.  Implementors are advised
   to create user interfaces that provide the watcher with the
   opportunity to choose whether to play such sounds.  Support for
   sounds coded as MPEG-2 Layer 3 (MP3) is RECOMMENDED.  The sound
   object might also be used to indicate how to pronounce the
   presentity's name.

6.2  Schema Registration for Schema urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:cipid'

   Registrant Contact: IESG
   XML: See Figure 1

7.  Internationalization Considerations

   CIPID delivers only URLs, except for the <displayname> element.  The
   resolution of the URLs can negotiate appropriate language and
   character sets within the URL-designated protocol.

   For the display name and to handle Internationalized Resource
   Identifiers (IRIs) [14], since CIPID is represented in XML, it
   provides native support for encoding information using the Unicode
   character set and its more compact representations including UTF-8.
   Conformant XML processors recognize both UTF-8 and UTF-16.  Though
   XML includes provisions to identify and use other character encodings
   through use of an "encoding" attribute in an <?xml?> declaration, use
   of UTF-8 is RECOMMENDED in environments where parser encoding support
   incompatibility exists.

   The XML 'xml:lang' attribute can be used to identify the language and
   script for the <displayname> element.  The specification allows
   multiple occurrences of this element so that the presentity can
   convey display names in multiple scripts and languages.  If no 'xml:

   lang' attribute is provided, the default value is "i-default" [3].

8.  Security Considerations

   The security issues are similar to those for RPID [9].  Watchers need
   to restrict which content types of content pointed to by <icon>,
   <homepage>, <map>, <sound>, and <vcard> elements they render.

   Also, when a watcher accesses these URIs, the presentity may deduce
   that the watcher is currently using the presence application.  Thus,
   a presence application concerned about leaking this information may
   want to cache these objects for later use.  (A presentity could
   easily customize the URLs for each watcher, so that it can tell who
   is referencing the objects.)  This caching behavior may cause the
   information to become stale, out-of-sync with the current data until
   the cache is refreshed.  Fortunately, the elements in CIPID are
   expected to retain the same content for periods measured in days, so
   that privacy-conscious applications may well decide to perform
   caching over durations that reveal little current activity
   information.  Presentities need to keep in mind that clients may
   cache the content referenced by URIs for long periods as they use
   their presence system to construct presence documents using this
   extension.  If the referenced content needs to change frequently, the
   presentity could, for example, update the presence document with a
   new URI to encourage clients to notice.

   Icons and other URIs in this document could be used as a covert
   channel to convey messages to the watcher, outside the content
   monitoring that might be in place for instant messages or other
   communications channels.  Thus, entities that worry about such
   channels may want to prohibit the usage of URLs pointing to resources
   outside their domain, for example.

   Implementors must take care to adhere to the mechanisms for verifying
   the identity in the referenced server's certificate against the URI.
   For instance, if the URI scheme is https, the requirements of RFC
   2818 [5], section 3.1, must be met.  In particular, the domain
   represented in the URI must match the subjectAltName in the
   certificate presented by the referenced server.  If this identity
   check fails, the referenced content SHOULD NOT be retrieved and MUST
   NOT be used.
