Internet-Draft      The GCM Mode of Camellia in IPsec         March 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the use of the Camellia block cipher
   algorithm in GCM Mode (Camellia-GCM) , as an IPsec ESP mechanism to
   provide confidentiality, and data origin authentication.  We refer to
   this method as Camellia-GCM-ESP.

   The algorithm specification and object identifiers are described in
   [5].

   GCM mode provides Counter mode (CTR) with data origin authentication.
   This document does not cover implementation details of GCM.  Those
   details can be found in [1].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [3].

3.  IKE Conventions

   This section describes the conventions used to generate keying
   material and salt values, for use with Camellia-GCM-ESP, using the
   Internet Key Exchange (IKE) [4] protocol.  The identifiers and
   attributes needed to negotiate a security association using Camellia-
   GCM-ESP are also defined.

3.1.   Keying Material and Salt Values

   IKE makes use of a pseudo-random function (PRF) to derive keying
   material.  The PRF is used iteratively to derive keying material of
   arbitrary size, called KEYMAT.  Keying material is extracted from the
   output string without regard to boundaries.

   The size of the KEYMAT for the Camellia-GCM-ESP MUST be four octets
   longer than is needed for the associated Camellia key.  The keying
   material is used as follows:

   Camellia-GCM-ESP with a 128 bit key
      The KEYMAT requested for each Camellia-GCM key is 20 octets.  The
      first 16 octets are the 128-bit Camellia key, and the remaining
      four octets are used as the salt value in the nonce.

    Camellia-GCM-ESP with a 192 bit key
      The KEYMAT requested for each Camellia-GCM key is 28 octets.  The
      first 24 octets are the 192-bit Camellia key, and the remaining
      four octets are used as the salt value in the nonce.

   Camellia-GCM-ESP with a 256 bit key
      The KEYMAT requested for each Camellia GCM key is 36 octets.  The
      first 32 octets are the 256-bit Camellia key, and the remaining
      four octets are used as the salt value in the nonce.

3.2.  Phase 1 Identifier

   This document does not specify the conventions for using Camellia-GCM
   for IKE Phase 1 negotiations.  For Camellia-GCM to be used in this
   manner, a separate specification is needed, and an Encryption
   Algorithm Identifier needs to be assigned.  Implementations SHOULD
   use an IKE Phase 1 cipher that is at least as strong as Camellia-GCM.
   The use of Camellia CBC [6] with the same key size used by Camellia-
   GCM-ESP is RECOMMENDED.

3.3.  Phase 2 Identifier

   For IKE Phase 2 negotiations, IANA has assigned three ESP Transform
   Identifiers for Camellia-GCM with an eight-byte explicit IV:

         <TBD1> for Camellia-GCM with an 8 octet ICV;
         <TBD2> for Camellia-GCM with a 12 octet ICV; and
         <TBD3> for Camellia-GCM with a 16 octet ICV.

3.4.  Key Length Attribute

   Because the Camellia supports three key lengths, the Key Length
   attribute MUST be specified in the IKE Phase 2 exchange [4].  The Key
   Length attribute MUST have a value of 128, 192, or 256.

5.  Security Considerations

   At the time of writing this document there are no known weak keys for
   Camellia.  And no security problem has been found on Camellia [7],
   [8]

   For other security considerations, please refer to the security
   considerations of the previous use of GMC mode document described in
   [2].

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned three ESP Transform Identifiers for Camellia-GCM
   with an eight-byte explicit IV:

         <TBD1> for Camellia-GCM with an 8 octet ICV;
         <TBD2> for Camellia-GCM with a 12 octet ICV; and
