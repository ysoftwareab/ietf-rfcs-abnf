Overview

   The IETF Integrated Directory Services (IDS) Working Group proposes to
   establish a specification for a simple Internet white pages service.
   To facilitate this effort it would be helpful to have a common schema
   used by the various white page servers.  This document is designed to
   specify the basic set of attributes to be used for a white page entry
   for a person.  This schema does not describe how to represent other
   objects in the White page service.  It does describe how new objects
   can be defined and registered.  This schema is independent of
   implementations of the White Page service.


1.0 Introduction

   The Internet community has stated that there is a need for the
   development and deployment of a White Page service.  This service
   would be used to locate information about people in the Internet.
   To facilitate interoperibility and a common user experience the
   Internet White Pages service needs to have a common set of information
   about each person.

   This Document will focus only on common information modeling issues
   to which all IWPS providers must conform. To insure a consistent User
   experience of this service we need to define a common User object.
   This will allow a User to go between different implementations of
   the service and have a consistent expectation as to what information
   can be found about people on the Internet.  Developers of this service
   need to have an unambiguous method of representing the Information

   objects managed by the service. This will help facilitate
   interoperability and data management.

2.0 Scope

   This document attempts to establish a simple set of information
   objects templates that should prove extensible and usable by developers
   of the IWPS. It will not attempt to be an exhaustive specification
   of all objects that will be stored in the IWPS.  It will provide a
   specification of how objects will be defined and registered as part
   of the IWPS.

3.0 IWPS Schema Considerations

   The information object description requirements for the IWPS consists
   of the following:

              1. Syntax for definition/representation of Information
                 Object Templates.
              2. Registration procedures for information object
                 Templates, etc.
              3. Database structure or schema.

   Items 1 and 2 will be covered in this Document. Database structure
   because, it will potentially restrict implementations (i.e. X.500
   schema based Vs DNS schema based) will not be defined in this
   document.  This area is a separate Research topic and will be covered
   in its own document.


3.1 Syntax for definition/representation of Information objects

   A clear, precise and consistent method must be used when information
   object Templates and their attributes are discussed within the
   context of IWPS.  There are two possible methods to do this. i.e.

              1.  BNF
              2.  ASN.1


   The Working Group recommends the use of ASN.1.  It provides us with
   a set of defined attributes and encoding syntax's. Also, it is well
   documented and widely available.

   The use of ASN.1 to specify the structure of the information objects
   does not imply the use of Basic Encoding Rules (BER) for any IWPS
   servers protocols.   The use of Object inheritance is not used or
   specified by this document.


3.2 Registration of IWPS Information object Templates.



Tony Genovese                                                   [Page 2]
Internet Draft           Common Schema for IWPS            November 1995


   The Working Group recommends the registration and publication of all
   information object Templates used for the IWPS.  We will use the IANA
   branch of the ISO OID tree for registration of the IWPS Object
   Templates.  This branch was used by the Object Templates listed in
   Appendix A.  To facilitate distribution of IWPS information object
   Templates they should be made available on the Internet information
   server (i.e. InterNIC).  At a minimum it is recommended that any new
   information object Template that will be made available via the IWPS
   will be published in a RFC and its OID registered with IANA.

   Individual organizations may define information object Templates that
   are only local in scope.  This may be needed to meet local
   organizational needs.  If these information object Templates are not
   registered with the IWPS, they may not be processable by the general
   IWPS UAs.  All information that the organization wishes to be part of
   the IWPS must use an IWPS registered information object Template.


4.0 Security Certificates

   Another feature that IWPS can provide us is the ability to store
   Security Certificates.   This capability  is needed by secure mail
   services such as PEM and PGP.  To facilitate the storage and
   management of these Certificates a new element is defined for the
   iwpPerson object.  This new element will allow multiple Certificates
   to be stored with the person record.  It also allows for the
   deprecation of certificates through the use of a validity field.
   This field is used to state the beginning and end dates the
   certificate is valid.  The element "certificates" is defined in
   Appendix A.


5.0 Data Integrity

   The question of Data Integrity was first addressed in RFC1107 [KS89].
   It basically states, that if the information is out of date it is
   useless and the service will not be used.  Therefore, a clear
   requirement is that any production IWPS provider must insure that all
   data is reasonably correct and current.

   To facilitate the User in determining the quality of the data that
   has been retrieved it is recommended that the optional Ancillary
   information attribute of the IWPperson Template be supported. This
   would require the IWPS UA to be able to retrieve and display this
   information. This may be done as a separate operation from the fetch
   of the information object. The Ancillary Information Attribute is
   defined in Appendix A. It is further recommended that any new
   information object Template include as a minimum the Ancillary
   information attribute as an optional attribute.  It would then be
   left to the IWPS servers to optionally support the storage and
   retrieval of this data.



Tony Genovese                                                   [Page 3]
Internet Draft           Common Schema for IWPS            November 1995


   The Ancillary Information attribute has been designed to provide the
   following information about the information object with which it is
   associated:

              1.  The date and time of the last modification.

              2.  Who performed the last modification.

              3.  Who owns or is responsible for the data stored
                  in the information object.

              4.  What is the official source of the data.

              5.  Which attributes in the information object have
                  been changed.

   As new information object Templates are defined for the IWPS a new
   changeRecord type will need to be defined for it and assigned to the
   changeRecord attribute.

   This attribute is not a part of the White Page Name (WPN).  Where
   WPN is an identifier for an instance of Information Object Template.
   The WPN is constructed from the attributes of the Object. The
   Ancillary Information attribute is not to be used as
   part of the Purported Name presented to the IWPS UA.


6.0 Unstructured Data

   There are a number of existing directory based systems that are
   currently providing White Pages style of information. These systems
   respond to queries by returning information without regard to any
   structure of the data. There is nothing in their protocol
   specifications that identify individual fields or attributes in the
   response that would allow it to be machine processable.

   To accommodate these systems and the way they return information, the
   element unstructureData has been added to the iwpPerson object. This
   element consists of a 1k block of data without any structure or
   content requirements. It can be used to represent/store any of the
   current sets of White Pages information.

   It should be noted that this element is added for backward
   compatibility of the existing systems only. It should not be used for
   the development of any new white page service.
