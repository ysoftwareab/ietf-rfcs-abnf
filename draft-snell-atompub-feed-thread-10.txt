Internet-Draft                 Feed Thread                      May 2006


1.  Introduction

   This document defines an extension for expressing threaded
   discussions within the Atom Syndication Format [RFC4287].


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119], as
   scoped to those conformance targets.

   The XML Namespaces URI [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114] for the XML
   elements and attributes described in this specification is:
     http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0

   In this document, the namespace prefix "thr:" is used for the above
   Namespace URI.  Note that the choice of namespace prefix is arbitrary
   and not semantically significant.

   This specification uses a shorthand form of terms from the XML
   Infoset [W3C.REC-xml-infoset-20040204].  The phrase "Information
   Item" is omitted when naming Element and Attribute Information Items.
   Therefore, when this specification uses the term "element," it is
   referring to an Element Information Item in Infoset terms.  Likewise,
   when this specification uses the term "attribute," it is referring to
   an Attribute Information Item.

   Some sections of this specification are illustrated with a non-
   normative RELAX NG Compact schema [RELAXNG].  In those sections this
   specification uses the atomCommonAttributes, atomMediaType and
   atomURI patterns defined in [RFC4287].

   However, the text of this specification provides the sole definition
   of conformance.


3.  The 'in-reply-to' extension element

   The "in-reply-to" element is used to indicate that an entry is a
   response to another resource and MUST contain either or both the
   "ref" and "href" attributes.

Internet-Draft                 Feed Thread                      May 2006


     in-reply-to =
       element thr:in-reply-to {
         atomCommonAttributes,
        ( ref, source?
        | href, type?
        | ref, source?, href, type? )
       }

     ref = attribute ref { atomURI }
     href = attribute href { atomURI }
     type = attribute type { atomMediaType }
     source = attribute source { atomURI }


   The "ref" attribute specifies the universally unique identifier of
   the resource being responded to.  The value MUST conform to the same
   construction and comparison rules as the value of the atom:id
   element.  The "source" attribute MAY be used to specify the IRI
   [RFC3987] of an Atom Feed or Entry Document containing an atom:entry
   with an atom:id value equal to the "ref" attribute.

   The "href" attribute specifies the IRI that may be used to retrieve a
   representation of the resource being responded to.  The "type"
   attribute MAY be used to identify the media type [RFC4288] of the
   resource identified by the "href" attribute.

   Atom entries MAY contain any number of "in-reply-to" extension
   elements.

   An example entry with a response,

     <feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
           xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">
       <id>http://www.example.org/myfeed</id>

       <updated>2005-07-28T12:00:00Z</updated>
       <link href="http://www.example.org/myfeed" />
       <author><name>James</name></author>
       <entry>
         <id>tag:example.org,2005:1</id>

         <updated>2006-03-01T12:12:12Z</updated>
         <link
           type="application/xhtml+xml"
           href="http://www.example.org/entries/1" />
         <summary>This is my original entry</summary>
       </entry>
       <entry>
         <id>tag:example.org,2005:1,1</id>
         <title>A response to the original</title>
         <updated>2006-03-01T12:12:12Z</updated>
         <link href="http://www.example.org/entries/1/1" />
         <thr:in-reply-to
           ref="tag:entries.com,2005:1"
           type="application/xhtml+xml"
           href="http://www.example.org/entries/1"/>
         <summary>This is a response to the original entry</summary>
       </entry>
     </feed>

   To allow Atom clients that are not familiar with the in-reply-to
   extension to know that a relationship exists between the entry and
   the resource being responded to, publishers are advised to consider
   including a "related" link referencing a representation of the
   resource identified by the in-reply-to element.

         <summary>This is a response to the original entry</summary>
       </entry>
     </feed>


4.  The 'replies' link relation

   An Atom link element with a rel attribute value of "replies" may be
   used to reference a resource where responses to an entry may be
   found.  If the type attribute of the atom:link is omitted, it's value
   is assumed to be "application/atom+xml".

   Atom feed, entry and source elements MAY contain any number of
   replies links.

   A "replies" link appearing as a child of the Atom feed or source
   element indicates that the linked resource may contain responses to
   any of that feeds entries.  A "replies" link appearing as a child of
   an Atom entry element indicates that the linked resource may contain
   responses specific to that entry.

   Atom links using the "replies" rel attribute value MAY contain a
   "thr:count" attribute whose value is a non-negative integer
   indicating the total number of replies contained by the linked
   resource.  The value is strictly advisory and may not accurately

Internet-Draft                 Feed Thread                      May 2006


   reflect the actual number of replies.

   Reply links MAY also contain a "thr:when" attribute whose value is a
   [RFC3339] date-time stamp conforming to the same construction rules
   as the Atom Date Construct defined in [RFC4287], and is used to
   indicate the date and time of the most recent reply contained by the
   linked resource.  The value is strictly advisory and may not
   accurately reflect the actual date and time of the most recent reply.

   For example,

     <feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
           xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">
       <id>http://www.example.org/myfeed</id>
       <title>My Example Feed</title>
       <updated>2005-07-28T12:00:00Z</updated>
       <link href="http://www.example.org/myfeed" />
       <author><name>James</name></author>
       <entry>
         <id>tag:entries.com,2005:1</id>
         <title>My original entry</title>
         <updated>2006-03-01T12:12:12Z</updated>
         <link href="http://www.example.org/entries/1" />
         <link rel="replies"
               type="application/atom+xml"
               href="http://www.example.org/mycommentsfeed.xml"
               thr:count="10" thr:when="2005-07-28T12:10:00Z" />
         <summary>This is my original entry</summary>
       </entry>
     </feed>

   The use of "replies" link relations specifying any media type other
   than "application/atom+xml" is undefined.  Software written to
   conform to this version of the specification will not be guaranteed
   to process such links correctly.


5.  Security Considerations

   As this specification defines an extension to the Atom Syndication
   Format, it is subject to the same security considerations as defined
   in [RFC4287].

   Feeds using the mechanisms described here could be crafted in such a
   way as to cause a consumer to initiate excessive (or even an unending
   sequence of) network requests, causing denial of service (either to
   the consumer, the target server, and/or intervening networks).
   Consumers can mitigate this risk by requiring user intervention after

   a certain number of requests, or by limiting requests either
   according to a hard limit, or with heuristics.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines one new Atom link relation type to be
   registered in the IANA Registry of Link Relation as defined by
   [RFC4287].
       Attribute Value: replies
       Description: (see section 4)
