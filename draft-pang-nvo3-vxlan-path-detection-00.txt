                Path Detection in VXLAN Overlay Network
                draft-pang-nvo3-vxlan-path-detection-00


Abstract

   In VXLAN overlay networks, Operation and Management(OAM)functions are
   important for fault management and performance monitoring. Path
   Detection(PD) is one critical OAM function which is applied to
   monitor and/or diagnose the potential paths between two VTEPs or
   between two Tenant System. In addition, it can assist to identify the
   locations of failures on data transmission paths. 

   This document specifies a method of PD method for VXLAN Overlay
   Networks by using a centralized controller. However,the method can be
   easily extended to support the overlay networks without a centrilized
   controller. It can also be generalized to other overlay technique
   such as NVGRE.

1.  Introduction

   In VXLAN overlay networks, OAM functions such as fault management
   should be implemented to prevent the path failure problem [NVO3-OAM-
   REQ]. Path Detection is one of OAM function which can be used to
   detect all available paths between two Tenant Systems or two VTEPs,
   and so it is widely used to assist the identify of the failure
   locations along a transmission path.

   In this memo, a PD mechanism is specified for VXLAN overlay networks.
   A centralized Controller is provided as a centralized unit to: 1)
   construct Path Detection(PD) packets, 2) inject them into the network
   devices to record information such as device's Ingress/Egress
   interface number, and 3) collect the PD packets from network devices
   for further analysis. Therefore, Path Detection such as monitoring
   and diagnose can be realized more efficient.   

   Figure 1 shows the architecture of this mechanism:

   This method can be extended to support the overlay network without
   fabric controller. In this case, it could be regarded as a
   traditional OAM fault management solution described in [NVO3-OAM-fm]
   . It can also be generalized to support other overlay technique such
   as NVGRE [NVGRE]. 

   The following of this document is organized as follows: Section 3
   describes the format of PD packets. Section 4 introduces the
   procedure of Path Detection between VTEPs. Section 5 describes the
   procedure of Path Detection between Tenant Systems.

3. Path Detection Under the Assistance of Fabric Controller  

   This section describes the format of PD packet. 

   To provide accurate monitoring and/or diagnostic services, a PD
   packet and the corresponding user packets should be transported over
   the same data path. In addition, PD packets SHOULD NOT be transferred
   to the outside of the overlay network.

   VXLAN Header (8 Octets): A fixed size field, used to carry NVO3
   specific information. This work complies with the VXLAN Header
   specified in Section 5 of [RFC 7348] but uses a reserve field as the
   flag to distinguish the packets for PD from the normal user packets.

   Pseudo-Header (128 Octets): A fixed size field, consists of the
   information of Ethernet MAC header, IPv4 header, and TCP/UDP header,
   which is used to identify the packets within the same flow.

   OAM PDU (Variable): A variable size field,used to carry the path
   detection information. An OAM PUB consists of OAM flag, OAM type and
   Extendable TLV as shown in Section 3.4. For a OAM PDU, 4 Octets
   alignment MUST be guaranteed.


3.2 Format of VXLAN Header

   In this work, the "PD" flag(as with the illustration in Figure 3)

               Figure 3  VXLAN header with the "PD" Flag


   PD (1 bit) - Indicates it is a PD packet and needs to be handled as
   specified in this document.

   All other fields comply with what are specified in Section 5 of [RFC
   7348].


3.3 Pseudo-Header

   The Pseudo-Header is used to ensure that the PD packets are
   transported along the paths that the service flows actually
   transported. In order to achieve this, the five-tuples identifying
   the service flow should be copied directly into associating fields in
   the Pseudo-header.

3.4 Format of OAM PDU   

   OAM PDU consists of an OAM flag field, an OAM type field and an
   Extendable TLV field. This structure is used to identify the type of
   Path Detection, and records the OAM information along the traverse
   path at each hop. The information will be report to fabric controller
   at each hop, in order to depict the complete path information.
   Following is the format of OAM PDU.

4. Path Detection between VTEPs 

   In VXLAN overlay networks, Equal Cost Multi-path(ECMP) may exist
   between two VTEPs, which may be leveraged to achieve load balance.
   Link failure and other reasons may lead to the broken of equal cost
   paths. In order to avoid delivering packets to the broken paths, it's
   necessary to detect all the potential paths between the VTEPs. The
   basic idea is to traversal these paths using the PD packets. 

   The process of path detection between VTEPs is:

   1. The Fabric Controller generates a series of Path Traversal packets
   targeting to the same Egress VTEP. The outer Source UDP port numbers
   of the Path Traversal packets keep increased by 1. For example,
   assume the outer Source UDP port number of a Path Traversal packet is
   set to 4000. Then the outer Source UDP port numbers of subsequent
   Path Traversal packets are set as 4001, 4002, 4003, etc. The 'PD bit'
   in VXLAN header is set to 1 . The content of Pseudo header is left to
   empty (default value is full-zero), and the OAM type field is set to
   0x01 to indicate that it is a Path Traversal packet. 

   2. After the Ingress VTEP receives the Path Traversal packets from 
   Controller, it then computes the corresponding egress port based on
   the outer header information and then delivers the packet to that
   port. By continuous increasing the Source UDP port number, these
   packets can be distributed to different equal cost paths. Therefore,
   these Path Traversal packets could go through all the equal cost
   paths between the two VTEPs.  

   3. The Extendable TLV field contains two TLVs. Both of them are set
   by the network devices along the transport path. The TLVs are used to
   record the identifier of device's Ingress/Egress interface the PD
   packet goes through. Each network device receives the Path Traversal
   packet from its upstream device, makes a copy of it and passes the
   copy to its CPU. After filling the extendable TLVs in this copy, the
   network device will deliver this copy to the Fabric Controller for

   further handling.   

   4. By gathering all the Path traversal packets from the network
   devices along the paths, the Controller is able to compute the number
   of available paths, which could be presented by graphical chart.



5. Path Detection between Tenant Systems

   In VXLAN overlay network, link failures are common and it may affect
   normal operations of up-layer applications. For example, it may lead
   to service flow interruptions which are unacceptable for most
   applications.

   Path Detection between two End Systems is essential for accurate
   monitoring and/or diagnostics. The basic idea is to transport the
   Path Tracking packets right along the path, that the service flow are
   transport through.

   The process of Path Detection between Tenant Systems is:

   1. The Fabric Controller generates one Path Tracking packet to
   Ingress VTEP. The 'PD bit' in the VXLAN header of the packet is set
   to 1. The content of Pseudo-header is set as the tuple information
   which are transported over the path being detected. The OAM type
   field is set to 0x02 to indicate it is a Path Tracking packet. 

   2. After the Ingress VTEP receives the Path Tracking packets from
   Fabric Controller, it will firstly compute the outer source UDP port
   number based on the information form in Pseudo-header. Then it
   deliveries these packets to the corresponding egress port based on
   the outer headers information. 

   3. Each network device receives the Path Tracking packet from its
   upstream device, makes a copy of it and passes the copy to its CPU.
   After filling the extendable TLVs in this copy, the network device
   will deliver this copy to the Controller for further handling. By
   doing this, each network device along the path will deliver a copy of
   Path Tracking packets back to Fabric Controller in a hop-by-hop
   manner.

   4. By gathering all the Path traversal packets from network devices
   along the paths, Fabric Controller is able to accurately monitor the
   status of each link on the data flow path and locate the point of
   failure. Fabric Controller may also present the path status using
   graphical chart.

6. Security Considerations

   VXLAN security consideration is discussed in Section 7 of RFC 7348.
   This document specifies a path failure detection mechanism by
   extending the VXLAN header. Thus it has the similar vulnerability as
   VXLAN. For example, attackers can inject spoofed path failure
   detection packets to the VXLAN overlay network. Administrative
   measures, ACL(Access Control List), authentication and encryption etc
   could be used to mitigate the attack.

   In addition, because the controller needs to collect and process the
   PD packets sent from the network devices. An attacker may perform
   DDoS attacks to the controller by generating a large amount of PD
   packets and sent them to a VXLAN overlay network. This issue will be
   well analyzed in our future work. 

7. IANA Considerations
   TBD.
