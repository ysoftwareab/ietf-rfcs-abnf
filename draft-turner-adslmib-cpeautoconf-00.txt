Abstract

   This document proposes a method for the automatic provisioning of
   ADSL Customer Premise Equipment (CPE). The term "automatic" in this
   context implies that no end-user or customer intervention is
   required to configure and provision the CPE for broadband service.
   Further, the model suggested by this proposal enables automatic
   configuration of access network equipment utilizing "flow-through"
   provisioning techniques already introduced in other standards
   bodies.

Internet-Draft      Model for Auto-Provisioning CPE         October 1999


1. Introduction

   The requirement for automatic provisioning exists because of
   potential scalability problems with manual, operator-assisted
   provisioning of mass-market DSL CPE. Critical to the success and
   economics of widespread deployment of DSL services is the ability
   for a particular network provider to easily install and maintain the
   broadband equipment for each customer, with little or no "hands-on"
   involvement by either the network provider or the customer. 

   Utilizing existing protocol familiarity, this document attempts to
   combine several enabling technologies for automatic provisioning of
   DSL CPE. The methods employed should provide a secure and extensible
   environment that will scale readily as the success of broadband DSL
   access evolves.

2. Scope

   This proposal is limited to the provisioning of broadband service
   connectivity only. Within the context of this document, the term
   "service" is meant to imply applications such as "video-on-demand",
   "audio-on-demand", or other applicaton layer services. The
   provisioning capability discussed in this document only covers
   layer-2 and layer-3 connection establishment. 

   This document does not address "service-specific" provisioning,
   wherein service-specific attributes are configured and managed. 	It
   is likely that individual applications will either be managed and
   configured using their own "in-band" techniques, or possibly through
   their own application-specific MIB. 

   This doucment also does not address traditional network management
   of DSL physical layer or MIB-II information. Given that there are
   existing networks of DSLAMs and DSL modems currently deployed, fault
   management of physical layer DSL information is not addressed, and
   interface management that would normally be handled by MIB-II is
   also not duplicated (or rehashed). However, the model suggested by
   this proposal reuses many of the same protocol mechanisms that are
   used by traditional network management, so low-level management of
   DSL CPE is not precluded by this model

3. Enabling Technologies

   The configuration and provisioning methodology described in this
   proposal makes use of the following existing enabling technologies: 

3.1 Integrated Local Management Interface (ILMI) 4.0

   The proposed method utilizes ILMI [4] messages during the CPE
   bootstrap process. Specifically, the proposal accesses the
   auto-provisioning extensions [6] of the ILMI 4.0 MIB. 

3.2 Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Version 3.0

   The proposed method utilizes SNMP Version 3 [5] as the primary
   network management protocol for both CPE and access network nodes.
   SNMP is widely deployed and understood by both CPE and
   telecommunications equipment vendors and customers. The SNMP
   capability is also leveraged by ILMI as well. Specifically, SNMP
   Version 3 contains robust security methods for both authentication
   of management clients, as well as support for confidentiality of the
   management information itself. SNMP Version 3 also updates earlier
   versions of SNMP with secure and reliable event notifications. This
   proposal uses the reliable notification capability to avoid
   burdensome polling rates by back-end network managment stations. 

3.3 UDP/IP

   UDP/IP is the dominant transport for SNMP in internets and
   intranets, ILMI being a notable exception. Unlike ILMI and
   preconfigured point-to-point virtual circuits, the proposal
   emphasizes network management via IP connectivity, which allows
   access providers across all potential business model boundaries, the
   maximum freedom in determining access network management topology. 

3.4 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)

   DHCP [9[ is a very popular and well understood technology for
   automatic configuration of IP-based hosts in internets and
   intranets. DHCP uses a very complete and extensible set of
   attributes for automated network configuration. DHCP is widely
   deployed by service providers as a flexible means of IP address
   space management, as well as generic configuration of a wide variety
   of both IP and non-IP parameters.

4. Provisioning Model

   The provisioning model is based on an SNMP manager/agent paradigm,
   involving two management entities, the CPE itself, and a remote
   provisioning server that exists within the network. The provisioning
   server can either be a standalone host within the network, or it may
   be co-resident on the same system with another management
   capability. The provisioning server is a software abstraction within
   the context of this document. 

   The relationship between CPE and provisioning server is not exactly
   client/server, since either CPE or provisioning server can
   temporarily serve as manager or agent. The manager and agent
   behavior between the two entities is context-sensitive. However, the
   nominal operating mode of the two entities is where the CPE acts in
   the role of SNMP manager, and the provisioning server contains an
   SNMP agent. The provisioning server contains all of the information
   related to CPE provisioning. The CPE accesses the provisioning
   server for it's service connectivity information.

5. Detailed Provisioning Procedure

   The following steps detail the proposed DSL CPE provisioning
   operations. 

5.1 CPE Power-up Initialization

   During CPE initialization, the CPE SNMP manager will access the ILMI
   auto-provisioning MIB extension [6] within the network. The CPE will
   index the ILMI auto-provisioning service table for a virtual circuit
   (VC) associated with the access provider's management network. 

5.2 Management Network Access

   Using the VC obtained via ILMI, the CPE will establish a PPP/LCP [7]
   connection to the network access server at the remote end of the VC.
   This network access server provides authenticated, secure access to
   the management network. The NAS may optionally employ RADIUS to
   enable this authentication step. Once an LCP session has
   successfully been established, an IPCP [8] session is then initiated
   over the PPP link to establish IP connectivity to the management
   network. Once IP has been successfully negotiated, the CPE will
   maintain this IP connectivity to the management network for as long
   as the CPE is powered up. 

   This capability requires a dedicated VC to be available for CPE-to
   management network. Alternatively, the model supports the idea of
   SVC-based access to the management network, wherein both
   provisioning server and CPE know each other's ATM end system address
   and the virtual circuit (and associated resources) do not have to be
   allocated continously. 

   Using IPCP, the CPE obtains an IP address that is valid within the
   management network domain. With IP connectivity established, the CPE
   subsequently issues DHCPINFORM requests to the management network
   attempting to locate a provisioning server on the management
   network. An administratively assigned DHCP server offers a set of
   available provisoning servers to the CPE. The CPE acknowledges the
   list of provisioning servers, and, through local policy, selects a
   particular provisioning server to use. 

   One of the ways in which the "correct" provisioning server can be
   selected is through the CPE's use of the DHCP client identifier
   and/or DHCP user class specification in the DHCPINFORM request. If a
   particular access network maintains a particular provisioning server
   for each vendor of CPE supported, then the DHCP client identifier
   value could be used to return the specific provisioning server to
   use for the requesting CPE.

Internet-Draft      Model for Auto-Provisioning CPE         October 1999


5.3 Provisioning MIB Access

   Using the IP address of the provisioning server, the CPE accesses
   the provisioning server MIB. The MIB is indexed according to a set
   of unique indices for the CPE (see MIB text in appendix A). The
   provisioning server MIB returns all services, and service-related
   connectivity parameters as part of the MIB access. All of the
   information necessary for the CPE to provision a network connection
   to the service provider is available within the CPE provisioning
   MIB. 

5.4 New or Modified Service Subscriptions

   DSL CPE should not be required to poll the provisioning server for
   new services or service parameters. Instead, whenever new service
   subscriptions for a particular customer are added, or existing
   service subscription profile is modified, the CPE is notified
   immediately by the provisioning server. The provisioning MIB
   includes an SNMP notification type that is automatically generated
   whenever subscription information is altered in any way. The SNMP
   notification is an SNMPv3 inform message sent to the CPE by the
   provisioning server, indicating to the CPE that it should revalidate
   it's service information cache. The SNMPv3 inform is more robust
   than a traditional SNMP trap in that the "inform" notification type
   is reliable, and must be explicitly acknowledged by the CPE.

6. Service Discovery and Selection

   In addition to customer subscription information, the Provisioning
   Server MIB contains a service table that describes all services that
   are available to customers served by this management domain (which
   could be partitioned by business entity or geographic region). By
   accessing the service table, the CPE can make available to the
   customer, information regarding additional incremental service
   offerings. The service table contains information that allows a
   customer to shop for these additional services at their convenience,
   and even order these services online

Internet-Draft      Model for Auto-Provisioning CPE         October 1999


7. Provisioning Server Replication

   It is strongly recommended that the network access provider maintain
   redundant provisioning servers within the network to prevent a
   single point of failure from impeding proper DSL service/CPE
   operation. Using multiple entries within the ILMI auto-discovery
   extensions MIB, an access provider can enable the DSL CPE to
   automatically switch provisioning servers during operation, should
   connectivity to an active server be in question. 

   Likewise, the access network provider may also optimize provisioning
   server capacity through load balancing of CPE across a number of
   provisioning servers within the network. This can be done through
   optimal automatic configuration of ILMI MIB information. Specific
   policies and mechanisms for instrumentation of load balancing are
   outside the scope of this document.

Internet-Draft      Model for Auto-Provisioning CPE         October 1999


8. Scalability Issues

   Where possible, it is recommended that bundles of PPP connections
   for management network connections be aggregated at a point early in
   the network (as close to the CPE as possible) in order to save
   switch resources in the allocation of permanent virtual circuits.
   The aggregation can utilize virtual path techniques or preferably
   Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP). With the advent of switched
   virtual circuits, this problem becomes less and less a priority.

9. Security Considerations

   There are several issues regarding security that must be addressed
   in order to provide sufficient implementation of the model. Most, if
   not all, of the actual secure instrumentation of the model is
   provided for in the SNMP version 3 protocol. However, the following
   sub-sections detail some other issues regarding the security aspects
   of the model. 

9.1 Subscriber authentication key(s)

   The subscriber authentication key is an opaque value used within the
   provisioning system to identify a CPE, and hence a particular
   subscriber premises. This authentication value should be made up of
   both CPE-derived information, as well as information derived by the
   network for the particular subscriber. The network-derived portion
   of the key should serve to prevent the overall authentication value
   from being "spoofed" 

9.2 Service Information Notifications

   Previously, an SNMPv3 notification mechanism was described for
   notifying DSL CPE when service information for a subscriber is
   modified. Because the notification may contain information that
   modifies service-related connection information, the CPE should
   apply strict authentication on the notification so as to avoid being
   redirected to an unauthorized service. SNMP version 3 provides
   sufficient authentication capabilities via the "user-based" security
   model.	Source IP addressing should not be used to authenticate the
   source of the notification since IP addresses can be spoofed. 

9.3 Service-Specific Configuration

   As stated previously, both the provisioning server, as well as the
   DSL CPE, can assume either an SNMP manager or agent role, depending
   upon the type and context of communication. The model proposed by
   this document is primarily concerned with provisioning of layer-2
   and layer-3 connectivity to specific service providers. However,
   once these circuits are established, one or more of these
   connections might be used by a service provider to manage their
   "service-specific" MIBs. Using SNMP version 3 user-based security,
   multiple service providers can independently manage their particular
   service- specific MIBs with a high degree of security. 

   The SNMPv3 agent within the CPE will protect each service provider's
   MIB data from being accessed or modified by another service provider
   or untrusted third party. There will typically be only one instance
   of the SNMP agent within the CPE, so it is important that
   independent provider's service information is appropriately
