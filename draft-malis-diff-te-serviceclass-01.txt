 1.     Overview  
      
    draft-ietf-tewg-diff-te-proto-00.txt [DS-MPLS-TE] defines protocol 
    additions for support of Diff-Serv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering.  
    Similarly, this document defines an RSVP-TE protocol addition to 
    support ATM Service Class-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering. 
     
 2.     ATM Service Class-Aware Traffic Engineering-related RSVP Message 
    Format  
         
    One new RSVP Object is defined in this document: the SERVICECLASS 
    Object. Detailed description of this Object is provided below. This 
    new Object is applicable to PATH messages. This specification only 
    defines the use of the SERVICECLASS Object in PATH messages used to 
    establish LSP Tunnels in accordance with [RSVP-TE] and thus 
    containing a Session Object with a C-Type equal to LSP_TUNNEL_IPv4 
    and containing a LABEL_REQUEST object. 
     
    Restrictions defined in [RSVP-TE] for support of establishment of 
    LSP Tunnels via RSVP are also applicable to the establishment of 
    LSP Tunnels supporting ATM Service Class-aware traffic engineering. 
    For instance, only unicast LSPs are supported and Multicast LSPs 
    are for further study. 
     
    This new SERVICECLASS object is optional with respect to RSVP so 
    that general RSVP implementations not concerned with ATM Service 
    Class-aware traffic engineering MPLS LSP setup do not have to 
    support this object. 
     
    An LSR supporting ATM Service Class-aware traffic engineering in 
    compliance with this specification MUST support the SERVICECLASS 
    Object. It MUST support Class-Type value 1, and MAY support other 
    Class-Type values. 
         
 2.1       PATH Message Format 
     
    The format of the PATH message is as follows: 
     
    <PATH Message> ::=      <Common Header> [ <INTEGRITY> ] 
                             <SESSION> <RSVP_HOP> 
                             <TIME_VALUES> 
                             [ <EXPLICIT_ROUTE> ] 
                             <LABEL_REQUEST> 
                             [ <SESSION_ATTRIBUTE> ] 
                             [ <DIFFSERV> ] 
                             [ <SERVICECLASS> ] 
                             [ <POLICY_DATA> ... ] 
                             [ <sender descriptor> ]

    <sender descriptor> ::=  <SENDER_TEMPLATE> [ <SENDER_TSPEC> ] 
                             [ <ADSPEC> ] 
                             [ <RECORD_ROUTE> ] 
     
 3.     SERVICECLASS Object 
     
    The SERVICECLASS object format is as follows: 
     
    Class Number = TBD, C_Type = 1 
    (This will use an official Class Number in the range 224-255, which 
    are assigned by IANA using FCFS allocation.  At the time of this 
    writing, the next available number in this range is 227.) 
     
     0                   1                   2                   3 
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    |                       Reserved                          | SC  | 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     
     
    Reserved : 29 bits 
         This field is reserved. It must be set to zero on transmission 
         and must be ignored on receipt. 
     
    SC : 3 bits 
         Indicates the ATM Service Class. Values currently allowed are: 
         0: UBR (Unspecified Bit Rate) 
         1: VBR-NRT (Variable Bit Rate, Non-Real Time) 
         2: VBR-RT (Variable Bit Rate, Real Time) 
         3: CBR (Constant Bit Rate) 
         4-7: reserved 
     
 4.     Handling the SERVICECLASS Object  
      
    To establish an LSP tunnel with RSVP, the sender LSR creates a PATH 
    message with a session type of LSP_Tunnel_IPv4 and with a 
    LABEL_REQUEST object as per [RSVP-TE]. The sender LSR may also 
    include the DIFFSERV object as per [DIFF-MPLS]. 
     
    If the LSP is associated with an ATM Service Class, the sender LSR 
    must include the SERVICECLASS object in the PATH message with the 
    Service-Class (SC) field set to signify the desired ATM Service 
    Class. 
     
    If a path message contains multiple SERVICECLASS objects, only the 
    first one is meaningful; subsequent SERVICECLASS object(s) must be 
    ignored and must not be forwarded.

    Each LSR along the path that is SERVICECLASS-aware records the 
    SERVICECLASS object, when present, in its path state block. 
     
    The destination LSR responds to the PATH message by sending a RESV 
    message without a SERVICECLASS object (whether the PATH message 
    contained a SERVICECLASS object or not). 
     
 5.     Non-support of the SERVICECLASS Object  
      
    An LSR that does not recognize the SERVICECLASS object Class Number 
    must behave in accordance with the procedures specified in [RSVP] 
    for an unknown Class Number with the binary format 11bbbbbb, where 
    b=0 or 1 (i.e. RSVP will ignore the object but forward it 
    unexamined and unmodified). 
     
    An LSR that recognizes the SERVICECLASS object Class Number but 
    does not recognize the SERVICECLASS object C-Type, must behave in 
    accordance with the procedures specified in [RSVP] for an unknown 
    C-type (i.e. it must send a PathErr with the error code 'Unknown 
    object C-Type' toward the sender). 
     
    In both situations, this causes the path setup to fail. The sender 
    should notify management that a LSP cannot be established and 
    possibly might take action to retry reservation establishment 
    without the SERVICECLASS object. 
       
 6.     Security Considerations  
      
    The solution is not expected to add specific security requirements 
    beyond those of Diff-Serv and existing TE. The security mechanisms  
    currently used with Diff-Serv and existing TE can be used with this  
    solution.
