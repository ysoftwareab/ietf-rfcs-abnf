         HyperText Markup Language Request For Comments Format
                      draft-hildebrand-html-rfc-10

Abstract

   In order to meet the evolving needs of the Internet community, the
   format for RFCs is changing from a plain-text, ASCII-only format to a
   canonical XML format that will in turn be rendered into several
   publication formats.  This document defines the HTML format that will
   be rendered for an RFC or Internet-Draft.

Status of This Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF).  Note that other groups may also distribute
   working documents as Internet-Drafts.  The list of current Internet-
   Drafts is at http://datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/current/.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
   time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

   This Internet-Draft will expire on February 25, 2016.

1.  Introduction

   As described in [I-D.flanagan-rfc-framework], the RFC Series is
   changing.  One of those changes includes the RFC Editor publishing a
   non-canonical HTML version of RFCs.

   This document describes the HTML format that will be used as one of
   the publication formats for the RFC Series.  It defines a strict
   subset of HTML appropriate for RFC Series documents.  The visual
   layout of the document will be defined through a cascading style
   sheet (CSS) [W3C.REC-CSS2-20110607].  The CSS will be included in the
   HTML file but will be described in a separate document.

   The details (particularly any vocabularies) described in this
   document are expected to change based on experience gained in
   implementing the RFC production center's toolset.  Revised documents
   will be published capturing those changes as the toolset is
   completed.  Other implementers must not expect those changes to
   remain backwards-compatible with the details described this document.

Internet-Draft                  HTML RFC                     August 2015


2.  Requirements for the HTML Format

   This section lists the design requirements used to create the HTML
   format described in this document.  These requirements build on those
   found in [RFC6949].  Many of these requirements are naturally
   fulfilled by using the output of the prep tool
   [I-D.hoffman-rfcv3-preptool].

   o  The HTML has to render correctly on a list of browser versions
      that the RFC Editor will keep up to date outside of this document.

   o  The format will consist of a subset of HTML deemed to be widely
      implemented by common browsers at the time the specification is
      created, likely to continue to be widely-implemented, and unlikely
      to cause security issues.  This will maximize the chances that
      future HTML renderers (such as new web browsers) will continue to
      produce readable text from the HTML format without the format
      needing to be changed frequently.

   o  These requirements are expected to change in the future to reflect
      the expectation that HTML rendering will be required for current
      versions of browsers and platforms, while ideally continuing to
      render correctly on recent versions of those browsers.

   o  The HTML documents from the RFC Editor or Internet-Drafts
      directory may be re-rendered from the canonical XML format in the
      future to ensure the ongoing readability of the documents.  The
      intent is that any re-rendering would be due to exceptional
      circumstances rather than for minor annoyances.

   o  The HTML must display adequately in at least one text-based
      browser.  Some consumers of the RFC series can only access the
      series on text-based terminals.

   o  The HTML document will be self-contained, without requiring
      external files for images, CSS, JavaScript, or the like.  This
      will allow the HTML file to be moved over various non-HTTP
      transports (such as e-mail, FTP, and rsync) without breakage.

   o  Any use of JavaScript in the HTML document must not be required
      for comprehensive reading of the document, because some consumers
      of the RFC series routinely disable JavaScript for security
      purposes.

   o  The HTML document will allow easy local override of the default
      CSS formatting.  This will allow users who have a different visual
      style that they prefer to make RFCs display with that style
      without having to alter the contents of the HTML document.  This

Internet-Draft                  HTML RFC                     August 2015


      might also be valuable for allowing people with specific
      accessibility needs to use a customized CSS.

   o  HTML tags in documents will rarely have attributes whose only
      purpose is to affect the rendered styling, and those will only be
      used if it would not be possible to specify that styling in CSS.
      No such attributes are known at this time.

   o  Both user-defined and auto-generated anchors must be supported and
      linkable, with user-defined anchors appearing in an "id"
      attribute.  Auto-generated anchors will be generated for every
      heading, paragraph, and so on, not just those that do not have
      user-defined anchors.  User-defined anchors may, and auto-
      generated anchors will, appear next to paragraphs, figures,
      tables, blockquotes, and section titles.

   o  All section, subsections, figures, and paragraphs should have
      stable numbered link anchors.  Additionally, anchors expressed in
      the source XML should be exposed as anchors in the HTML output as
      well.

   o  The HTML must make it easy to separate sections along with all of
      their subsections into separate files.  This will make creating
      EPUB documents easier in the future.

   o  The HTML produced for Internet-Drafts will differ fromt that
      produced by the RFC Editor due to differences in the output from
      the prep tool.

   o  The abstract must be marked up or tagged in a way that popular
      search engines will extract it as a summary.

2.1.  Requirements for Accessibility

   o  Normative information must be easily accessible to the following
      consumers:

      *  People with impaired vision, including those that use large
         fonts and those that use screen readers

      *  People with difficulty distinguishing between colors

      *  People who use devices with small screens, such as cell phones

      *  Other groups to be determined later

   o  Specific instances where goals for accessibility are important in
      the design choices of the format have been called out in the text.

   o  NOTE: designing for these consumers does not preclude the use of
      features they cannot use, but does require that key semantic data
      is not lost when read using the tools and settings that are
      required by a given constituency.

3.  HTML Version

   The RFC Editor will periodically determine which version of the HTML
   specification will be referenced for tools generating the format
   defined in this document.  The starting version will be that defined
   in [W3C.REC-html5-20141028], commonly known as "HTML5".  Although the
   HTML specification mandates several of the syntax and structure rules
   described in this document, they are called out here for emphasis.

4.  HTML Syntax

   The processor emitting HTML from the XML source will follow these
   rules:

   o  The HTML output is encoded as UTF-8, as specified in [RFC3629].

   o  The document is valid HTML.

   o  Double quotes (U+0022 QUOTATION MARK: ") are used to quote
      attribute values unless the HTML specification forbids quoting a
      particular attribute.

   o  Each logical line is terminated solely with a \n (U+000A: LINE
      FEED), otherwise known as "Unix-style" line endings.

   o  Other than \n (U+000A: LINE FEED), code points less than " "
      (U+0020: SPACE) (otherwise known as "control characters") are not
      used.  Any character references that would generate these code
      points (such as &#0009;) may not be used.  NOTE: this rule
      explicitly forbids \t (U+0009: CHARACTER TABULATION), \f (U+000C:
      FORM FEED), and \r (U+000D: CARRIAGE RETURN) from appearing in the
      output.

   o  Comments in the source XML, if any, will not be copied into the
      HTML.

   o  The HTML output will be pretty-printed, using whatever consistent
      rules deemed best in the HTML production tool.

   NOTE: none of these rules affect the rendered output of the HTML, but
   are intended to increase the chance that difference tools that
   operate on the HTML output easier to write.

Internet-Draft                  HTML RFC                     August 2015


5.  Common Items

   This section lists items that are common across multiple parts of the
   HTML document.

5.1.  IDs

   HTML elements that are generated from XML elements that include an
   "anchor" attribute will use the value of the "anchor" attribute as
   the value of the "id" attribute of the corresponding HTML element.
   The prep tool produces XML with "anchor" attributes in all elements
   that need them.  Some HTML constructs (such as <section>) will use
   multiple instances of these identifiers.

5.2.  Pilcrows

   Each paragraph, artwork, or sourcecode segment outside of a <figure>
   or <table> element will be appended with a space and a "pilcrow"
   (U+00B6: PILCROW SIGN), otherwise known as a "paragraph sign".  For
   the purposes of clarity, in this document pilcrows are rendered as
   "&para;".  The pilcrow will linked to the "id" attribute on the XML
   entity to which it is associated.

   The pilcrow will normally be invisible unless the element it is
   attached to is moused over.  The pilcrow will be surrounded by a link
   that points to the element it is attached to.

   Pilcrows are never included inside a <table> or <figure> elements,
   since the figure number or table number serve as adequate link
   targets.

   Elements that might otherwise contain a pilcrow do not get marked
   with a pilcrow if they contain one or more child elements that are
   marked with a pilcrow.  For example:

   <blockquote id="p-1.2-1">
     <p id="p-1.2-2">Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought
       forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and
       dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
       <a href="#p-1.2-2" class="pilcrow">&para;</a></p>
     <!-- NO pilcrow here -->
   </blockquote>

5.3.  ASCII Equivalents

   Many elements in the v3 schema in [I-D.hoffman-xml2rfc] contain
   attributes for ASCII equivalents of the Unicode text contained in the
   element or the Unicode attribute value.  These alternatives are



Hildebrand & Hoffman    Expires February 25, 2016               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                  HTML RFC                     August 2015


   included in the HTML as in a <span> tag with the class "ascii".  The
   <span> is included inside the tag that is showing the text to the
   user.  For example:

   <span class="surname">
     HILDEBRAND
     <span class="ascii">Hildebrand</span>
   </span>

5.4.  Syntactic Elements

   A few HTML elements are added to ensure particular syntax items can
   be styled appropriately using CSS.

   Commas that are not in running text (e.g., that might have white-
   space added before them by the HTML indentation step) are wrapped by
   an HTML <span> tag of CSS class "comma".

   Periods that are not in running text (e.g., that might have white-
   space added before them by the HTML indentation step) are wrapped by
   an HTML <span> tag of CSS class "fullStop".

   Open and close parentheses that are not running text (e.g., that
   might have white-space added before them by the HTML indentation
   step) are wrapped by an HTML <span> tag of CSS class "openParen" or
   "closeParen" respectively.

6.  Front Matter

   The front matter of the HTML format contains processing information,
   metadata of various types, and styling information that applies to
   the document as a whole.  This section describes HTML that is not
   necessarily a direct transform from the XML format.  For more details
   on each of the tags that generate content in this section, see
   Section 9.

6.1.  DOCTYPE

   The DOCTYPE of the document is "html", which declares that the
   document is compliant with HTML5.  The document will start with
   exactly this string:

   <!DOCTYPE html>

Internet-Draft                  HTML RFC                     August 2015


6.2.  Root Element

   The root element of the document is <html>.  This element includes a
   lang attribute, whose value is a [RFC5646] language tag describing
   the natural language of the document.  The language tag to be
   included is "en".  The class of the <html> element will be copied
   verbatim from the XML <rfc> element's "mode" attribute, allowing CSS
   to style RFCs and Internet-Drafts differently from one another (if
   needed):

   <html lang="en" class="RFC">

6.3.  Head Element

   The root <html> will contain a <head> element that contains the
   following elements, as needed.

6.3.1.  Charset Declaration

   In order to be correctly processed by browsers that load the HTML
   using a mechanism that does not provide a valid MIME content-type or
   charset (such as from a local file system using a "file:" URL), the
   HTML <head> element contains a <meta> element, with charset attribute
   with value "utf-8":

   <meta charset="utf-8"/>

6.3.2.  Document Title

   The contents of the <title> element from the XML source will be
   placed inside an HTML <title> element in the header.

6.3.3.  Document metadata

   The following <meta> elements will be included:

   o  author - comma-separated <fullname>s of all of the <author>s from
      the XML source

   o  description - the <abstract> from the XML source

   o  generator - the name and version number of the software used to
      create the HTML

   o  keywords - comma-separated <keyword>s from the XML source

   For example:

Internet-Draft                  HTML RFC                     August 2015


   <meta name="author" content="Joe Hildebrand,Heather Flanagan">
   <meta name="keywords" content="html,css,rfc">
   <meta name="description" content="This document defines...">
   <meta name="generator" content="xmljade v0.2.4">

6.3.4.  Style

   The <head> element contains an embedded CSS style sheet in a <style>
   element.  The styles in the style sheet are to be set consistently
   between documents by the RFC Editor, according to the best practices
   of the day.

   To ensure consistent formatting, individual style attributes are not
   used in the main portion of the document except in highly exceptional
   circumstances; each use of such attributes will be individually
   justified.

   Different readers of a specification will desire different formatting
   when reading the HTML versions of RFCs.  To facilitate this, the
   <head> element also includes a <link> to a style sheet in the same
   directory as the HTML file, named "rfc-local.css".  Any formatting in
   the linked style sheet will override the formatting in the included
   style sheet.  For example:

   <style>
     body {}
     ...
   </style>
   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="rfc-local.css">

6.3.5.  Links

   Each <link> element from the XML source is copied into the HTML
   header.

6.4.  Document Information

   Information about the document as a whole will appear as the first
   child of the HTML <body> element, embedded in an HTML <dl> element
   with id="identifiers".  The defined terms in the definition list are
   "Workgroup:", "Series:", "Status:", "Published:", and "Authors:".
   For example:

           (<span class="organization">RFC Editor</span>)</div>
       </dd>
   </dl>

6.5.  Table of Contents

   The table of contents will follow the boilerplate if the XML's <rfc>
   element's tocInclude attribute has the value "true".  An HTML <h2>
   heading containing the text "Table of Contents" will be followed by a
   <nav> element that contains a <ul> element for each depth of the
   section hierarchy.  Each section will be represented by a <li>
   element containing links by the section number (from the "pn"
   attribute) and by the name (from the "slugifiedName" attribute of the
   <name> child element).  Each <nav>, <ul>, and <li> element will have
   the class "toc".

   For example:

   <h2 id="toc">Table of Contents</h2>
   <nav class="toc">
     <ul class="toc">
       <li class="toc">
         <a href="s-1">1</a>. <a href="n-introduction">Introduction</a>
       </li>
       <ul class="toc">
         <li class="toc">
           <a href="s-1.1">1.1</a>. <a href="n-sub-intro">Sub Intro</a>
         </li>
   ...

7.  Main Body

   The main body of the HTML document is processed according to the
   rules in Section 9.

8.  Back Matter

   The back matter of the HTML document includes an index (if
   generated), information about the authors, and further information
   about the document itself.

8.1.  Index

   The index will be produced at the end of the document (before the
   author information) if and only if the XML document's <rfc> element
   has a indexInclude attribute with the value "true", and there is one
   or more <iref> elements in the document.

8.1.1.  Index Contents

   The index section will start with an <h2> heading containing the text
   "Index", followed by links to each of the lettered portions of the
   index.  Links are not generated for letters that do not occur as the
   first letter of an index item.

   For example:

   <h2>Index</h2>
   <div class="index">
     <div class="indexIndex">
       <a href="#rfc.index.C">C</a>
       <a href="#rfc.index.P">P</a>
     </div>
     ...

8.1.2.  Index Letters

   The index index is followed by a <ul> tag that contains a <li> tag
   for each first letter represented in the index.  This <li> tag has
   the class "indexChar", and contains an <a> tag with the id pointed to
   by the index index, as well as an href to itself.  The <li> tag also
   includes a <ul> tag that will contain the index items.

   For example:







Hildebrand & Hoffman    Expires February 25, 2016              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft                  HTML RFC                     August 2015


   <ul>
     <li class="indexChar">
       <a href="#rfc.index.C" id="rfc.index.C">C</a>
       <ul>
         <!-- items go here -->
       </ul>
     </li>
     ...

8.1.3.  Index Items

   Each index item can have multiple <iref> elements to point to, all
   with the same item attribute.  Each index item is represented by a
   <li> tag of class "indexItem" containing a <span> of class "irefItem"
   for the item text and one of class "irefRefs" for the generated
   references (if there is at least one reference to the item not having
   a subitem).  Each generated reference contains an <a> tag containing
   the section number where the <iref> was found, with an "href"
   attribute pointing to the "irefid" attribute of the <iref> element
   from the XML document.  If the primary attribute of the <iref>
   element has the value "true", the <a> element in the HTML document
   will have the class "indexPrimary".  Commas may be used to separate
   the generated references, surrounded by a <span> tag with class
   "comma".

   For example:

   <li class="indexItem">
     <span class="irefItem">Bullets</span>
     <span class="irefRefs">
       <a class="indexPrimary" href="#s-Bullets-1">2</a>
       <span class="comma">,</span>
       <a href="#s-Bullets-2">2</a>
     </span>
     <!-- subitems go here -->
   </li>
   ...

8.1.4.  Index Sub-items

   If an index item has at least one subitem, the <li> of that item will
   contain a <ul>, with one <li> for each subitem, of class
   "indexSubItem".  Each subitem is formatted similarly to items, except
   the class of the first <span> tag is "irefSubItem".

   For example:

Internet-Draft                  HTML RFC                     August 2015


   <ul>
     <li class="indexSubItem">
       <span class="irefSubItem">Ordered</span>
       <span class="irefRefs">
         <a href="#s-Bullets-Ordered-1">2</a>
       </span>
     </li>
   </ul>
   ...

8.2.  Authors' Addresses

   At the end of the document, author information will be included
   inside an HTML <section> element.  The class names have been chosen
   to match the class names in [HCARD].

   Note: The following example shows several ASCII equivalents that are
   the same as their nominal equivalents for clarity; normally the ASCII
   equivalents would not be included for these cases.

   <section id="author-addresses">
     <h2>

8.3.  Document Information

   A few bits of metadata about the document that are less important to
   most readers are included after the author information.  The style
   sheet might de-emphasize their display, or hide them altogether.
   These are gathered together into a <div> of class "docInfo".

   The finalized time is copied from the <rfc> element's prepTime
   attribute.  The rendered time is the time that this HTML was
   generated.

   For example:

8.4.  XML Source

   At the very end of the document, the XML source that was used to
   produce this document will be included within a comment.  This
   comment may be preceded by another comment that describes the source.

   Any instances of "--" in the XML will be modified to use U+002D
   characters: "--".  Note that if the dashes in the original XML were
   in a comment start- (<!--) or end-delimiter (-->), the XML will not
   parse correctly without reversing this transformation.

   <!-- XML SOURCE START (note: each instance of
        two '-' (U+002D: HYPHEN-MINUS) characters
        changed to "&#x2d;&#x2d;") -->

9.  Elements

   This section describes how each of the XML elements from
   [I-D.hoffman-xml2rfc] is rendered to HTML.  Many of the descriptions
   have examples to clarify how elements will be rendered.

9.1.  <abstract>

   The abstract is rendered similarly to a <section> with
   anchor="abstract" and <name>Abstract</name>, but without a section
   number.

   <section id="abstract">
     <h2><a href="#abstract" class="selfRef">Abstract</a></h2>
     <p id="p-abstract-1">This document defines...
       <a href="#p-abstract-1" class="pilcrow">&para;</a>

9.2.  <address>

   This element is used in Authors' Addresses (Section 8.2).

9.3.  <annotation>

   This element is rendered as a span of class "annotation" at the end
   of a <reference> element, the span containing appropriately-
   transformed elements from the children of the <annotation> tag.  A
   <span> of class "comma" is added before the annotation, containing
   ",".

   <span class="comma">,</span>
   <span class="annotation">
     You <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> read this annotation.
   </span>

9.4.  <area>

   Not currently rendered to HTML.

9.5.  <artwork>

   Artwork can either consist of inline text or SVG.  If the artwork is
   not inside a <figure> element, a pilcrow (Section 5.2) is included.
   Inside a <figure> element, the figure title serves the purpose of the
   pilcrow.  If the "align" attribute has the value "right", the CSS
   class "alignRight" will be added.  If the "align" attribute has the
   value "center", the CSS class "alignCenter" will be added.

9.5.1.  Text Artwork

   Text artwork is rendered inside an HTML <pre> element, which is
   contained by a <div> element for consistency with SVG artwork.  Note
   that CDATA blocks do not work consistently in HTML, so all <, >, and
   & must be escaped as &lt;, &gt;, and &amp;, respectively.

   The <div> element will have CSS classes of "artwork" and "art-"
   prepended to the value of the <artwork> element's "type" attribute,
   if it exists.

9.5.2.  SVG Artwork

   SVG artwork MUST be included inline.  The SVG is wrapped in a <div>
   element with CSS classes "artwork" and "art-svg".

9.7.1.  Authors of this document

   As seen in Authors' Addresses (Section 8.2), at the end of the
   document, each document author is rendered into an HTML <address>
   element with the CSS class "vcard".

   The HTML <address> element will contain an HTML <div> with CSS class
   "nameRole".  That div will contain an HTML <span> element with CSS
   class "fn" containing the value of the "fullname" attribute of the
   <author> XML element, and an HTML <span> element with CSS class
   "role" containing the value of the "role" attribute of the <author>
   XML element (if there is a role).  Parentheses will surround the
   <span class="role">, if it exists, each enclosed in a <span> with CSS
   class "openParen" or "closeParen" as appropriate.

   <address class="vcard">
     <div class="nameRole">
       <span class="fn">Joe Hildebrand</span>
       <span class="openParen">(</span>
       <span class="role">editor</span>
       <span class="closeParen">)</span>
     </div>
     ...

   The <author> element from the <front> of the document is also
   rendered into the Document Information (Section 6.4), the HTML meta
   headers (Section 6.3.3), and in <references>.  See each of those
   sections for details.

9.7.2.  Authors of references

   In the output generated from a reference element, author tags are
   rendered inside an HTML <span> element with CSS class "refAuthor".

9.8.  <back>

   This element does not add any direct output to HTML.

9.9.  <bcp14>

   This element marks up words like MUST and SHOULD with an HTML <span>
   element with the CSS class "bcp14".

   You <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> be joking.

9.10.  <blockquote>

   This element renders as the similar HTML <blockquote> element.  If
   there is a "cite" attribute, it is copied to the HTML cite attribute.
   If there is a "quoteFrom" attribute, it is placed inside a <cite>
   element at the end of the quote, with an <a> element surrounding it
   (if there is a "cite" attribute), linking to the "cite" URL.

   If the blockquote does not contain another element that get a pilcrow
   (Section 5.2), a pilcrow is added.

   Note that the "--" at the begining of the <cite> element should be a
   proper emdash, which is difficult to show in the current format of
   this format.

   <blockquote id="p-1.2-1"
     cite="http://...">
     <p id="p-1.2-2">Four score and seven years ago our fathers
       brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived

   This element is rendered in an HTML <pre> with a CSS class of
   "sourcecode".  Note that CDATA blocks do not work consistently in
   HTML, so all <, >, and & must be escaped as &lt;, &gt;, and &amp;,
   respectively.  If the input XML has a "type" attribute, another CSS
   class of "lang-" and the type is added.

   If the sourcecode is not inside a <figure> element, a pilcrow
   (Section 5.2) is included.  Inside a <figure> element, the figure
   title serves the purpose of the pilcrow.

   <pre class="sourcecode lang-c">
   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   int main(void)
   {
       printf(&quot;hello, world\n&quot;);
       return 0;
   }
   </pre>

9.49.  <street>

   This element renders as an HTML <div> with CSS class "street-
   address".

   <div class="street-address">1899 Wynkoop St, Suite 600</div>

9.50.  <strong>

   This element is directly rendered as its HTML counterpart.

9.51.  <sub>

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document contains no actions for IANA

11.  Security Considerations

   Since RFCs are sometimes exchanged outside the normal Web sandboxing
   mechanism (such as using the "rsync" program to a mirror site) then
   loaded from a local file, more care must be taken with the HTML than
   is ordinary on the web.
