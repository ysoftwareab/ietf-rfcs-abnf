1.  Introduction

   Most of the loop-free convergence mechanisms
   [I-D.bryant-shand-lf-conv-frmwk] require one or more convergence
   delay timers that MUST have a duration that is consistent throughout
   the routing domain.  This time is the worst case time that any router
   will take to calculate the new topology, and to make the necessary
   changes to the FIB.  The timer is used by the routers to know when it
   is safe to transition between the loop- free convergence states.

   The time taken by a router to complete each phase of the loop-free
   transition will be dependent on the size of the network and the
   design and implementation of the router.  It can therefore be
   expected that the optimum delay will need to be tuned from time to
   time as the network evolves.

   Manual configuration of the timer is fraught for two reasons, firstly
   it is always difficult to ensure that the correct value is installed
   in all of the routers, and secondly, if any change is introduced into
   the network that results in a need to change the timer, for example
   due to a change in hardware or software version, then all of the
   routers need to be reconfigured to use the new timer value.

   It is therefore desirable that a means be provided by which the
   convergence delay timer can be automatically synchronized throughout
   the network.


2.  Required Properties

   The timer synchronization mechanism MUST have the following
   properties:

      o The convergence delay time must be consistent amongst all
      routers that are converging on the new topology.

      o The convergence delay time must be the highest delay required by
      any router in the new topology.

      o The mechanism must increase the delay when a new router in
      introduced to the network that requires a higher delay than is
      currently in use.

      o When the router that had the longest delay requirements is
      removed from the topology, the convergence delay timer value must,
      within some reasonable time, be reduced to the longest delay
      required by the remaining routers.

      o It must be possible for a router to change the convergence delay
      timer value that it requires.

      o A router which is in multiple routing areas, or is running
      multiple routing protocols may signal a different loop-free
      convergence delay for each area, and for each protocol.

   How a router determines the time that it needs to execute each
   convergence phase is an implementation issue, and outside the scope
   of this specification.  However a router that dynamically determines
   its proposed timer value must do so in such a way that it does not
   cause the synchronized value to continually fluctuate.


3.  Mechanism

   The following mechanism is proposed.

   A new information element is introduced into the routing protocol
   that specifies the maximum time (in milliseconds) that the router
   will take to calculate the new topology and to update its FIB as a
   result of any topology change.

   When a topology change occurs, the largest convergence delay time
   required by any router in the new topology is used by the loop-free
   convergence mechanism.

   If a routing protocol message is issued that changes the convergence
   delay timer value, but does not change the topology, the new timer
   value MUST be taken into consideration during the next loop-free
   transition, but MUST NOT instigate a loop-free transition.

   If a routing protocol message is issued that changes the convergence
   timer value and changes the topology, a loop-free transition is
   instigated and the new timer value is taken into consideration.

   The loop-free convergence mechanism should specify the action to be
   taken if a timer change (only) message and a topology change message
   are independently generated during the hold-off time.  A suitable
   action would be to take the same action that would be taken if two
   uncorrelated topology changes occurred in the network.

   All routers that support loop-free convergence MUST advertise a loop-
   free convergence delay time.  The loop-free convergence mechanism
   MUST specify the action to be taken if a router does not advertise a
   convergence delay time.

4.  Protocol Details

   This section describes the protocol changes needed to implement the
   timer synchronization function.

4.1.  ISIS

   The controlled convergence timer value will be carried in a new Sub-
   TLV of the capability TLV as defined in [I-D.ietf-isis-caps] .

   This draft defines one such SUB-TLV where the type is for the worst-
   case FIB compute/install time, the value is 16 bits and is specified
   in milliseconds; this gives a max value of about 65s.

   The format of the Sub-TLV is as shown below.

      Sub-TLV FIB-Convergence Timer

      TYPE: <TBD>

      Length: 2 octets

      Value: <16-bit timer value expressed in milliseconds>

   This MUST be carried in a capability TLV with the S-bit set to zero
   (indicating that it MUST NOT be leaked between levels).

4.2.  OSPF

   A new type-10 opaque LSA (the controlled convergence LSA) will be
   defined as part of OSPF changed needed to define the loop-free
   convergence mechanism.  This will consist of one or more TLVs.  This
   draft defines one such TLV where the type is for the worst-case FIB
   compute/install time, the value is 16 bits and is specified in
   milliseconds; this gives a max value of about 65s.


5.  IANA considerations

   There will be IANA considerations that arise as a result of this
   draft, but they are not yet determined.


6.  Security Considerations

   If an abnormally large timer value is proposed by a router, the there
   is a danger that the loop-free convergence process will take an
   excessive time.  If during that time the routing protocol signals the

   need for another transition, the loop-free transition will be
   abandoned and the default best case (traditional) convergence
   mechanism used.

   It is still undesirable that the routers select a convergence delay
   time that has an excessive value.  The maximum value that can be
   specified in the LSP/LSA is limited through the use of a 16 bit field
   to about 65 seconds.  When sufficient implementation experience is
   gained, an architectural constant will be specified which sets the
   upper limit of the convergence delay timer.
