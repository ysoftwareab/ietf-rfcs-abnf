1.  Introduction and Scope

   This document updates RFC 2026 ([RFC2026], BCP 9) to remove a limit
   on the number of Area Directors who manage an Area in the definition
   of "IETF Area".  This document also updates RFC 2418 ([RFC2418], BCP
   25) to reflect this updated definition.

   The change described in this document is intended to allow the IESG
   additional flexibility in organizing the IETF's work.  It does not
   make any changes to the role of an Area, and does not argue that
   assigning more than two Area Directors to an Area is an optimal
   solution in the long run.  In particular, this change is not intended
   to increase the size of the IESG significantly.  If several Areas
   will require more than two Area Directors, the IESG should consider
   investigating alternative ways of organizing the IETF's work.

2.  Discussion

   In recent discussions, the IESG has explored splitting and combining
   Areas.  One proposal resulted in a single Area that would be managed
   by three Area Directors.

   An Area managed by three Area Directors conflicts with this
   definition in Section 14, "DEFINITIONS OF TERMS" of RFC 2026
   ([RFC2026]):

      IETF Area - A management division within the IETF.  An Area
      consists of Working Groups related to a general topic such as
      routing.  An Area is managed by one or two Area Directors.

   A similar statement appears in Section 1, "Introduction" of RFC 2418
   ([RFC2418]):

      Each IETF area is managed by one or two Area Directors (ADs).

Internet-Draft       More Area Directors in an Area        November 2014


   In the distant past, all IETF Areas had a single Area Director.  The
   movement from single Area Directors in an Area to pairs of Area
   Directors in most Areas happened over a period of years (for
   reference, see http://www.ietf.org/iesg/past-members.html), as part
   of the IESG organizing itself to do the work the IESG is chartered to
   do.

   The last time the IESG increased the number of Area Directors in an
   Area was when they provided a position description to the Nominating
   Committee for a second Area Director in the Routing Area in 1999.
   Although the number of Area Directors in an Area hasn't changed since
   then, the IESG continues to be responsible for specifying the
   positions that Nomcom would fill each year.

   It is consistent with the IESG's role in creating and dismantling
   entire Areas to allow the IESG flexibility in assigning enough Area
   Directors who have been selected by the Nominating Committee to
   effectively manage the working groups within an Area.

   Note that the requirement in RFC 3777 ([RFC3777], BCP 10) that the
   Nominating Committee review (approximately) half the positions for
   the IESG each year is unchanged.  The Nomcom may assign an
   appropriate term duration for each position to ensure the ideal
   application of this rule in the future, and this is also unchanged.

3.  Normative Text Change

   For this text (OLD) in Section 14, "DEFINITIONS OF TERMS" of RFC 2026
   ([RFC2026]):

      IETF Area - A management division within the IETF.  An Area
      consists of Working Groups related to a general topic such as
      routing.  An Area is managed by one or two Area Directors.

   Replace with this text (NEW):

      IETF Area - A management division within the IETF.  An Area
      consists of Working Groups related to a general topic such as
      routing.  An Area is managed by one or more Area Directors.

   For this text (OLD) in Section 1, "Introduction" of RFC 2418
   ([RFC2418]):

      Each IETF area is managed by one or two Area Directors (ADs).

   Replace with this text (NEW):

      Each IETF area is managed by one or more Area Directors (ADs).

Internet-Draft       More Area Directors in an Area        November 2014


   Informational RFCs such as RFC 3710 ([RFC3710]) and informal
   descriptions of IETF organizational structure which also describe
   IETF Areas as being managed by one or two Area Directors should be
   considered updated by this normative specification.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document updates an IETF process BCP and has no direct Internet
   security implications.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requests of IANA, and the RFC Editor can
   safely remove this section during publication.

6.  NOTE TO THE RFC Editor

   This document has a normative dependency on RFC 3777, and draft-
   kucherawy-rfc3777bis, which obsoletes RFC 3777, is already in IETF
   Last Call.  The dependency on RFC 3777 is perfectly well met by
   draft-kucherawy-rfc3777bis, if it's approved first, and the reference
   can safely be updated to draft-kucherawy-rfc3777bis.

   This section can safely be removed by the RFC Editor before
   publication.

7.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Barry Leiba and Jari Arkko for applying the giggle test to
   this document and to Brian Carpenter, David Harrington and Murray
   Kucherawy for providing comments.
