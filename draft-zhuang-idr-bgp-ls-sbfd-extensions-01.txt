               BGP Link-State Extensions for Seamless BFD
               draft-zhuang-idr-bgp-ls-sbfd-extensions-01

Abstract

   [I-D.ietf-bfd-seamless-base] defines a simplified mechanism to use
   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) with large portions of
   negotiation aspects eliminated, thus providing benefits such as quick
   provisioning as well as improved control and flexibility to network
   nodes initiating the path monitoring.  The link-state routing
   protocols (IS-IS, OSPF and OSPFv3) have been extended to advertise
   the Seamless BFD (S-BFD) Discriminators.

   This draft defines extensions to the BGP Link-state address-family to
   carry the S-BFD Discriminators information via BGP.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-bfd-seamless-base] defines a simplified mechanism to use
   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)[RFC5880] with large portions
   of negotiation aspects eliminated, thus providing benefits such as
   quick provisioning as well as improved control and flexibility to
   network nodes initiating the path monitoring.

   [I-D.ietf-isis-sbfd-discriminator] defines a mean of advertising one
   or more S-BFD Discriminators using the IS-IS Router Capability TLV.
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-sbfd-discriminator] defines a new OSPF Router
   Information (RI) TLV that allows OSPF routers to flood the S-BFD
   discriminator values associated with a target network identifier.
   This mechanism is applicable to both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.

   The link-state routing protocols (IS-IS, OSPF and OSPFv3) have been
   extended to advertise the S-BFD Discriminators.  But flooding based
   propagation of the S-BFD Discriminators using IGPs is limited by the

   perimeter of the IGP domain.  For advertising the S-BFD
   Discriminators which span across IGP domains (e.g. multiple ASes),
   the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is better suited as its propagation
   perimeter is not limited like the IGPs.

   This draft defines extensions to the BGP Link-state address-family to
   carry the S-BFD Discriminators information via BGP.

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-seamless-base].

3.  Problem and Requirement

   Seamless MPLS [I-D.ietf-mpls-seamless-mpls] extends the core domain
   and integrates aggregation and access domains into a single MPLS
   domain.  In a large network, the core and aggregation networks can be
   organized as different autonomous systems.  Although the core and
   aggregation networks are segmented into different autonomous systems,
   but an E2E LSP will be created using hierarchical-labeled BGP LSPs
   based on iBGP-labeled unicast within each AS, and eBGP-labeled
   unicast to extend the LSP across AS boundaries.  Meanwhile, the
   customer will see only two service-end points in the Seamless MPLS
   network.  In order to detect the possible failure quickly and protect
   the network/trigger re-routing, BFD MAY be used for the Service Layer
   (e.g.  for MPLS VPNs, PW ) and the Transport Layer, so the need
   arises that the BFD session has to span across AS domain.

   The link-state routing protocols (IS-IS, OSPF and OSPFv3) have been
   extended to advertise the S-BFD Discriminators.  But flooding based
   propagation of the S-BFD Discriminators using IGPs is limited by the
   perimeter of the IGP domain.  For advertising the S-BFD
   Discriminators which span across IGP domains (e.g. multiple ASes),
   the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is better suited as its propagation
   perimeter is not limited like the IGPs.  This draft defines
   extensions requirement to the BGP Link-state address-family to carry
   the S-BFD Discriminators information via BGP.

4.  BGP-LS Extensions for S-BFD Discriminators Exchanging

   The BGP-LS NLRI can be a node NLRI, a link NLRI or a prefix NLRI.
   The corresponding BGP-LS attribute is a node attribute, a link
   attribute or a prefix attribute.  BGP-LS
   [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution] defines the TLVs that map link-state
   information to BGP-LS NLRI and BGP-LS attribute.  This document adds
   additional BGP- LS attribute TLVs to encode the S-BFD Discriminators
   information.

   [I-D.ietf-isis-sbfd-discriminator] defines the following TLVs to
   encode the S-BFD Discriminators information.

   The ISIS Router CAPABILITY TLV as defined in [RFC4971] will be used
   to advertise S-BFD discriminators.  A new Sub-TLV is defined as
   described below.  S-BFD Discriminators Sub-TLV is formatted as
   specified in [RFC5305].

                                             No. of octets
            +-----------------------------+

            | Length (multiple of 4)      |     1
            +-----------------------------+
            | Discriminator Value(s)      |     4/Discriminator

            Figure 1: S-BFD Discriminators Sub-TLV for ISIS


   Inclusion of the S-BFD Discriminators sub-TLV in a Router Capability
   TLV is optional.  Multiple S-BFD Discriminators sub-TLVs MAY be
   advertised by an IS.

   [I-D.ietf-ospf-sbfd-discriminator] defines the following TLVs to
   encode the S-BFD Discriminators information.  The format of the S-BFD
   Discriminator TLV is as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3

   Length - Total length of the discriminator (Value field) in octets,
   not including the optional padding.  The Length is a multiple of 4
   octets, and consequently specifies how many Discriminators are
   included in the TLV.

   Value - S-BFD network target discriminator value or values.

   Routers that do not recognize the S-BFD Discriminator TLV Type MUST
   ignore the TLV.  S-BFD discriminator is associated with the BFD
   Target Identifier type, which allows de-multiplexing to a specific
   task or service.

   These TLVs are mapped to BGP-LS attribute TLVs in the following way.
   The new information in the Link-State NLRIs and attributes is encoded
   in Type/Length/Value triplets.

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

     |              Type             |             Length            |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     //                        Value (variable)                     //
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                     Figure 3: BGP-LS TLV format


   The 2 octet Type field values are defined in Table 1.  The next 2
   octet Length field encodes length of the rest of the TLV.  The Value
   portion of the TLV is variable and is equal to the corresponding
   Value portion of the TLV defined in
   [I-D.ietf-isis-sbfd-discriminator] and
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-sbfd-discriminator].

   The following 'Node Attribute' TLVs are defined:

   +---------------+-------------------------+----------+--------------+
   |    TLV Code   | Description             | Length   |    ISIS/OSPF |
   |     Point     |                         |          |  TLV/Sub-TLV |
   +---------------+-------------------------+----------+--------------+
   |      TBD      | S-BFD Discriminators    | variable |          TBD |
   |      ...      | ...                     | ...      |          ... |
   +---------------+-------------------------+----------+--------------+
                           Table 1: Node Attribute TLVs


   These TLVs can ONLY be added to the Node Attribute associated with
   the Node NLRI that originates the corresponding S-BFD Discriminator
   TLV.
