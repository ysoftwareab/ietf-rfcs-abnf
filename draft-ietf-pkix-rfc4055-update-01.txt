Abstract 

   This document updates RFC 4055.  It updates the conventions for using 
   the RSA Encryption Scheme - Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding 
   (RSAES-OAEP) key transport algorithm with the Public-Key Cryptography 
   Standards (PKCS) #1 version 1.5 signature algorithm in the Internet 
   X.509 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).  Specifically, it updates the 
   conventions for algorithm parameters in an X.509 certificate's 
   subjectPublicKeyInfo field.

Discussion 

   This draft is being discussed on the 'ietf-pkix' mailing list. To 
   subscribe, send a message to ietf-pkix-request@imc.org with the 
   single word subscribe in the body of the message. There is a Web site 
   for the mailing list at <http://www.imc.org/ietf-pkix/>. 

1. Introduction 

   RFC 4055 specifies conventions for using the RSA Encryption Scheme - 
   Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (RSAES-OAEP) key transport 
   algorithm with the Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #1 
   version 1.5 signature algorithm in the Internet X.509 Public Key 
   Infrastructure (PKI).  It provides algorithm identifiers and 
   parameters for RSAES-OAEP. 

   This document updates the conventions for RSAES-OAEP parameters in 
   the subjectPublicKeyInfo field of an X.509 certificate. The PKIX WG 
   Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) design team recommended that Key 
   Derivation Functions (KDFs) should not be constrained within a 
   certificate; rather, KDF constraints should be negotiated in 
   protocols that need to employ certificates. 

   Only two paragraphs in [RFC4055] discuss RSAES-OAEP parameters in 
   X.509 certificates: the second paragraph of section 4 and the first 
   paragraph of section 4.1.  This document only updates these two 
   paragraphs.  Section 3 updates the second paragraph in section 4 
   while section 3 updates the second paragraph in section 4.1.  "Old:" 
   prefaces the text to be replaced and "New:" prefaces the replacement 
   text. 

   This document also replaces incorrect references to the 
   publicKeyAlgorithms field in Section 3 with references to the 
   parameters field in the subjectPublicKeyInfo algorithm field. No 
   other changes are made to the RSASSA-PSS sections.

2. Changes to Section 3 2nd Paragraph 

   Old:  

   CAs that issue certificates with the id-RSASSA-PSS algorithm 
   identifier SHOULD require the presence of parameters in the 
   publicKeyAlgorithms field if the cA boolean flag is set in the basic 
   constraints certificate extension.  CAs MAY require that the 
   parameters be present in the publicKeyAlgorithms field for end-entity 
   certificates. 

   New: 

   CAs that issue certificates with the id-RSASSA-PSS algorithm 
   identifier SHOULD require the presence of parameters in the 
   subjectPublicKeyInfo algorithm field if the cA boolean flag is set in 
   the basic constraints certificate extension.  CAs MAY require that 
   the parameters be present in the subjectPublicKeyInfo algorithm field 
   for end-entity certificates. 

3. Changes to Section 4 2nd Paragraph 

   Old: 

   CAs that issue certificates with the id-RSAES-OAEP algorithm 
   identifier SHOULD require the presence of parameters in the 
   publicKeyAlgorithms field for all certificates.  Entities that use a 
   certificate with a publicKeyAlgorithm value of id-RSA-OAEP where the 
   parameters are absent SHOULD use the default set of parameters for 
   RSAES-OAEP-params.  Entities that use a certificate with a 
   publicKeyAlgorithm value of rsaEncryption SHOULD use the default set 
   of parameters for RSAES-OAEP-params. 

   New: 

   CAs that issue certificates with the id-RSAES-OAEP algorithm 
   identifier MUST NOT include parameters in the subjectPublicKeyInfo 
   algorithm field. 

4. Changes to Section 4.1 1st Paragraph 

   Old: 

   When id-RSAES-OAEP is used in an AlgorithmIdentifier, the parameters 
   MUST employ the RSAES-OAEP-params syntax.  The parameters may be 
   either absent or present when used as subject public key information.

   The parameters MUST be present when used in the algorithm identifier 
   associated with an encrypted value. 

   New: 

   When id-RSAES-OAEP is used in an AlgorithmIdentifier, the parameters 
   MUST employ the RSAES-OAEP-params syntax.  The parameters MUST be 
   absent when used in the subjectPublicKeyInfo field.  The parameters 
   MUST be present when used in the algorithm identifier associated with 
   an encrypted value. 

5. Security Considerations 

   The security considerations from [RFC4055] apply. No new security 
   considerations are introduced. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   None
