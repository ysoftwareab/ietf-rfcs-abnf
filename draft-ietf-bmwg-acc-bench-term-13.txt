1. Introduction

   Routers in an operational network are configured with multiple 
   protocols and security policies while simultaneously forwarding 
   traffic and being managed.  To accurately benchmark a router for 
   deployment, it is necessary to test that router under operational 
   conditions by simultaneously configuring and scaling network 
   protocols and security policies, forwarding traffic, and managing 
   the device in a lab environment.  It is useful to accelerate these 
   network operational conditions so that the router under test can 
   be benchmarked in a lab environment with a shorter test duration.  
   Testing a router in accelerated network conditions is known as 
   Accelerated Stress Benchmarking.  

   This document provides the Terminology for performing Stress 
   Benchmarking of networking devices.  The three phases of the Stress 
   Test: Startup, Instability and Recovery are defined along with the
   benchmark and configuration terms associated with the each phase.
   Benchmarks for stress testing are defined using the Aggregate 
   Forwarding Rate and control plane Session Count during each phase 
   of the test.  For each plane, the Configuration Set, Startup 
   Conditions, and Instability Conditions are defined.  Also defined are 
   the Benchmark Planes fundamental to stress testing configuration, 
   setup and measurement.  These are the Control Plane, Data Plane, 
   Management Plane and Security Plane. Multiple benchmarks are measured 
   for each Benchmark Plane during each Phase.  Benchmarks can be 
   compared across multiple planes for the same DUT or at the same 
   plane for 2 or more DUTS.  Benchmarks of internal DUT characteristics 
   such as memory and CPU utilization (also known as White Box 
   benchmarks) are described in Appendix 1, to allow additional 
   characterization of DUT behavior.  The terminology is to be used with 
   the companion methodology document [4].  The sequence of phases, 
   actions, and benchmarks are shown in Table 1.

2.  Existing definitions
   RFC 1242 [1] and RFC 2285 [2] should be consulted before 
   attempting to make use of this document. For the sake of clarity 
   and continuity this RFC adopts the template for definitions set 
   out in Section 2 of RFC 1242. Definitions are indexed and grouped 
   together in sections for ease of reference.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [5].  RFC 2119 defines the use of these key words to help make the
   intent of standards track documents as clear as possible.  While this
   document uses these keywords, it is not a standards track document.

     Definition: 
        Control Plane sessions that are intentionally brought
        down during the Stress test.

      Discussion:
        Discontinued Sessions is performed during the test in 
        order to stress the DUT by forcing it to tear down Control 
        Plane sessions while handling traffic. It is assumed that 
        the test equipment is able to control protocol session 
        state with the DUT and is therefore able to introduce 
        Discontinued Sessions.

        but were not intentionally brought down during the 
        Stress test.

      Discussion:
        The test equipment is able to control protocol 
        session state with the DUT.  The test equipment
        is also to monitor for sessions lost with the
        DUT which the test equipment itself did not 
        intentionally bring down.

      Discussion:
        A key component of the Accelerated Stress Benchmarking is the 
        Management Plane to assess manageability of the router 
        under stress.  The Management Plane defines the Configuration, 
        Startup Conditions, and Instability Conditions of the 
        management protocols and features.  The Management Plane 
        includes SNMP, Logging/Debug, Statistics Collection, and 
        management configuration sessions such as telnet, SSH, and 
        serial console.

   3.3 Startup

   3.3.1 Startup Phase

     Definition
        The step of the benchmarking test in which the
        Startup Conditions are generated with the DUT.  This 
        begins with the attempt to establish the first session 
        and ends when the last Control Plane session is 
        established.

     Discussion:
        The Startup Phase is the first Phase of the benchmarking 
        test preceding the Instability Phase and Recovery Phase.  
        It is specified by the Configuration Sets and Startup 
        Conditions for each Benchmark Plane.  The Startup Phase ends
        and Instability Phase MUST begin when the Configuration Sets 
        are achieved with the DUT.  The DUT MUST be stable and 
        without failure during the Startup Phase to continue to the 
        Instability Phase.  If there is failure during the Startup 
        Phase then the test MUST be restarted with new Startup 
        Conditions.

   3.3.2.1 Stable Aggregate Forwarding Rate

     Definition: 
        Sum of forwarding rates for all interfaces on the 
        DUT during the Startup Phase.

      Discussion:
        The Stable Aggregate Forwarding Rate is calculated from 
        measurement samples throughout the entire Startup Phase.
        Stable Aggregate Forwarding Rate is the calculated average 
        of the samples measured during the Startup Phase.  It is
        RECOMMENDED that the sample measurements be made on every
        DUT interface every 1 second. 
 
      Measurement units:
        pps

      Issues:
        The act of the DUT establishing the Startup Conditions
        could influence the forwarding rate in certain 
        implementations so that this "baseline" for the 
        remainder of the test is lowered.  The alternative is
        to change the definition of Stable Aggregate 
        Forwarding Rate so that it is measured after Startup 
        Conditions are achieved.  The disadvantage of that 
        definition would be that it loses measurement of any 
        impact that establishing Startup  Conditions would have 
        on forwarding rate. When comparing the Startup Aggregate 
        Forwarding Rate benchmark of two devices it is preferred 
        to know the impact establishing Startup Conditions has 
        on Forwarding Rate.

        established and maintained by the DUT during the Startup 
        Phase and prior to Instability Conditions being initiated.

      Discussion:
        This measurement SHOULD be made after the Control
        Plane Startup Conditions are applied to the DUT.

      Discussion:
        A key component of the Accelerated Stress Benchmark is the 
        Management Configuration Set to assess manageability of the 
        router under stress.  The Management Configuration Set defines 
        the management configuration of the DUT.  Features that are 
        part of the Management Configuration Set include access, SNMP, 
        Logging/Debug, and Statistics Collection, and services such as 
        FTP, as shown in Figure 3. These features SHOULD be enabled
        throughout the Stress test.

      Definition:
        The reduction in Aggregate Forwarding Rate during the

      Discussion:
        The Aggregate Forwarding Rate Degradation is calculated 
        for each measurement of the Unstable Aggregate Forwarding 
        Rate.  The Aggregate Forwarding Rate Degradation is 
        calculated by subtracting each measurement of the Unstable 
        Aggregate Forwarding Rate from the Stable Aggregate 
        Forwarding Rate, such that

        Aggregate Forwarding Rate Degradation= 
        Stable Aggregate Forwarding Rate - 
            Unstable Aggregate Forwarding Rate

      Definition:
        The average increase in measured packet latency during 
        the Instability Phase compared to the Startup Phase.  

      Discussion:
        Latency SHOULD be measured at a fixed interval during the
        Instability Phase.  Unstable Latency is the difference 
        between Stable Latency and the average Latency measured 
        during the Instability Phase.  It is expected that there
        be an increase in average latency from the Startup Phase
        to the Instability phase, but it is possible that the
        difference be zero.  The Unstable Latency cannot be a
        negative number.

   3.4.3.3 Management Plane Instability Conditions

      Definition: 
        Management Plane conditions that occur during the Accelerated 
        Stress Benchmark to produce instability and stress the DUT.  

      Discussion:
        Management Plane Instability Conditions are experienced by the 
        DUT after the Startup Conditions have completed.  Management 
        Plane Instability Conditions experienced by the DUT include 
        repeated FTP of large files.

   3.4.3.4 Security Plane Instability Conditions

     Definition: 
        Security Plane conditions that occur during the Accelerated 
        Stress Benchmark to produce instability and stress the DUT.  

     Discussion:
        Security Plane Instability Conditions are experienced by the DUT 
        after the Startup Conditions have completed.  Security Plane 
        Instability Conditions experienced by the DUT include session
        loss and uninitiated policy changes.

   3.5 Recovery
   3.5.1 Recovery Phase

     Definition:
        The step of the benchmarking test in which the
        Startup Conditions are generated with the DUT, but 
        the Instability Conditions are no longer offered to 
        the DUT.

     Discussion:
        The Recovery Phase is the final Phase of the
        benchmarking test following the Startup Phase and
        Instability Phase. Startup Conditions MUST NOT be 
        Restarted.

     Measurement Units: None

     Issues: None

   3.5.2 Benchmarks
   3.5.2.1 Recovered Aggregate Forwarding Rate
      Definition
        Rate of traffic forwarded by the DUT during the Recovery
        Phase.	

      Discussion:
        Recovered Aggregate Forwarding Rate is an instantaneous 
        measurement of the Aggregate Forwarding Rate during the 
        Recovery Phase.  Ideally, each measurement of the Recovered
        Aggregate Forwarding Rate equals the Stable Aggregate
        Forwarding Rate because the Instability Conditions
        do not exist in both the Startup and Recovery Phases.	

      Measurement Units:
        pps

      Issues: None

      See Also:

   3.5.2.2 Recovered Latency

      Definition:
        The average increase in measured packet latency during 
        the Recovery Phase compared to the Startup Phase.  

      Discussion:
        Latency SHOULD be measured at a fixed interval during the
        Recovery Phase.  Unstable Latency is the difference 
        between Stable Latency and the average Latency measured 
        during the Recovery Phase.  It is expected that there
        be no increase in average latency from the Startup Phase
        to the Recovery Phase.  The Recovered Latency cannot be a
        negative number.

      Measurement units:
        seconds

      Issues: None

      See Also:
        Recovery Phase	
        Stable Latency

   3.5.2.3 Recovery Time 

      Definition
        The amount of time for the Recovered Aggregate Forwarding 
        Rate to become equal to the Stable Aggregate Forwarding Rate.

      Discussion
        Recovery Time is measured beginning at the instant the 
        Instability Phase ends until the Recovered Aggregate 
        Forwarding Rate equals the Stable Aggregate Forwarding 
        Rate for a minimum duration of 180 consecutive seconds.

      Measurement Units:
        milliseconds

      Issues:
        None

        Recovered Aggregate Forwarding  Rate
        Stable Aggregate Forwarding Rate

   3.5.2.4  Recovered Uncontrolled Control Plane Sessions Lost

     Definition: 
        Control Plane sessions that are in the down state
        but were not intentionally brought down during the 
        Recovery Phase.

      Discussion:
        The test equipment is able to control protocol 
        session state with the DUT.  The test equipment
        is also to monitor for sessions lost with the
        DUT which the test equipment itself did not 
        intentionally bring down.

      Measurement units:
        sessions

      Issues:
        None

      See Also:
        Discontinued Sessions
        Uncontrolled Session Loss

   3.5.2.5 Variability Benchmarks

      Definition:
        The difference between the measured Benchmarks of the 
        same DUT over multiple iterations.

      Discussion:
        Ideally, the measured benchmarks should be the same for multiple 
        iterations with the same DUT.  Configuration Sets and 
        Instability Conditions MUST be held constant for this 
        benchmark.  Whether the DUT can exhibit such predictable and 
        repeatable behavior is an important benchmark in itself.  

      Measurement units:
        As applicable to each Benchmark. The results are to be 
        presented in a table format for successive Iterations. 
        Ideally, the differences should be zero.

      Issues:
        None

        Instability Period
