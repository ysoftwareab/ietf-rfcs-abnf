                     Actors in the ACE Architecture
                       draft-gerdes-ace-actors-00

Abstract

   Constrained nodes are small devices which are limited in terms of
   processing power, memory, non-volatile storage and transmission
   capacity.  Due to these constraints, commonly used security protocols
   are not easily applicable.  Nevertheless, an authentication and
   authorization solution is needed to ensure the security of these
   devices.

   This document defines actors in the security architecture for
   authentication and authorization, analyzes the relationships between
   them, and describes their respective tasks and characteristics.  This
   knowledge will then be used to derive requirements for the
   communication between the actors.

1.  Introduction

   Constrained nodes are small devices with limited abilities which in
   many cases are made to fulfill a single simple task.  They have
   limited system resources such as processing power, memory, non-
   volatile storage and transmission capacity and additionally in most
   cases do not have user interfaces and displays.  Due to these
   constraints, commonly used security protocols are not always easily
   applicable.

   Constrained nodes are expected to be integrated in all aspects of
   every day live and thus will be trusted with a lot of personal data.
   Without appropriate security mechanisms attackers might gain control
   over things relevant to our lives.  Authentication and authorization
   mechanisms are therefore prerequisites for a secure Internet of
   Things.

   The Authentication and Authorization in Constrained Environments
   (ACE) Working Group aims at defining a solution for authenticated and
   authorized access to resources.

   To achieve this, it is necessary to develop a deep understanding
   about the problem to be solved.  An essential part of this is to
   identify the various "players" in the scenario: What are the relevent
   actors in the archicture and which tasks do they fulfill?  How can
   the relationships between the actors be defined?

   This document defines actors, their relationships and resulting
   security requirements for authentication and authorization in
   constrained environments.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document uses the following terminology:

   Resource:  an item of interest.  It might contain sensor or actuator
      values or other information.  The author had resources in the
      sense of RFC2616 [RFC2616] in mind, but for the considerations in
      this document the kind of representation of the item is not
      relevant.

   Constrained node:  a constrained device in the sense of [RFC7228].

2.  Problem Statement

   The problem the ACE Working Group aims to solve can be summarized as
   follows:

   o  A Client (C) wants to access a Resource (R) on a Resource Server
      (RS).

   o  A priori, C and RS do not know each other and have no trust
      relationship.

   o  C and / or RS are constrained.

     -------      requests resource    --------
     |  C  |     ------------------>   |  RS  |
     -------                           --------

   There are some security requirements for this scenario including one
   or more of:

   o  No unauthorized entity must be able to access (or otherwise gain
      knowledge of) R.

   o  C must access the proper R.

   Therefore, RS needs to know if C is allowed to access R and if that
   is the case needs to make sure that it provides the resource only to
   C. C needs to know if R as offered by RS really is the resource it
   wants to access.

3.  Actors

   This section describes the various actors in the architecture.  An
   actor is identified by the tasks it has to fulfill.  Several actors
   might share a single device or even be combined in a single piece of
   software.  Interfaces between actors may be realized as protocols or
   be internal to such a piece of software.

3.1.  Constrained Level Actors

   As described above, either C or RS or both of them may be located on
   a constrained node.  Although they are not necessarily constrained
   they should be able to operate if they are.  We therefore derive from
   the problem description that C and RS must be able to perform their
   tasks even if they are located on a constrained node.  Thus, C and RS
   are considered to be Constrained Level Actors.

   RS is hosting a resource R.

   R is an item of interest such as a sensor or actuator value.  R is
   considered to be part of RS and is not a separate actor.  The device
   on which RS is located might contain several resources of different
   resource owners.  For simplicity of exposition, these resources are
   described as if they had separate RS.

   C attempts to access a resource on RS.

   As C and RS do not previously know each other they might belong to
   different security domains.

3.2.  Principal Level Actors

   Our objective is that C and RS are under control of principals in the
   physical world, the Client Owner (CO) and the Resource Owner (RO)
   respectively.  The owners decide about the security policies of their
   respective devices and belong to the same security domain.

   CO is in charge of C, i.e. CO specifies security policies for C, e.g.
   with whom C is allowed to communicate.  By definition, C and CO
   belong to the same security domain.

   RO is in charge of R and RS.  RO specifies authorization policies for
   R and decides with whom RS is allowed to communicate.  By definition,
   R, RS and RO belong to the same security domain.

      ------                            ------
      | CO |                            | RO | Principal Level
      ------                            ------
        |                                 |
   in charge of                      in charge of
        |                                 |
        V                                 V
     -------                            --------
     |  C  |  -- requests resource ---> |  RS  | Constrained Level
     -------  <-- provides resource---  --------


3.3.  Less-Constrained Level Actors

   Constrained level actors can only fulfill a limited number of tasks
   and may not have network connectivity all the time.  To relieve them
   from having to manage keys for numerous devices and conducting
   computationally intensive tasks, another complexity level for actors
   is introduced.  An actor on the less-constrained level belongs to the
   same security domain as its respective constrained level actor.  They
   also have the same principal.

   The Authentication Manager (AM) belongs to the same security domain
   as C and CO.  AM acts on behalf of CO.  It is aiding C in the
   authentication of RS and determining if RS is an authorized source
   for R.

   The Authorization Server (AS) belongs to the same security domain as
   R, RS and RO.  AS acts in behalf of RO.  It supports RS by
   authenticating C and determining C's permissions on R.

      ------                            ------
      | CO |                            | RO |   Principal Level

4.  Protocol Requirements

   Devices on the less-constrained level are more powerful than
   constrained level devices.  This results in different requirements
   for the protocols used on these levels.

4.1.  Constrained Level Protocols

   A protocol is considered to be on the constrained level if it is used
   between the actors C and RS which are considered to be constrained
   (see Section 3.1).  C and RS might not belong to the same security
   domain.  Therefore, constrained level protocols are required to work
   between different security domains.

   Commonly used Internet protocols can not in every case be applied to
   constrained environments.  In some cases, tweaking and profiling is
   required.  In other cases it is beneficial to define new protocols
   which were designed with the special characteristics of constrained
   environments in mind.

   On the constrained level, protocols must be used which address the
   specific requirements of constrained environments.  The Constrained
   Application Protocol (CoAP) [I-D.ietf-core-coap] should be used as
   transfer protocol if possible.  CoAP defines a security binding to
   Datagram Transport Layer Security Protocol (DTLS) [RFC6347].  Thus,
   DTLS should be used for channel security.

   Constrained devices have only limited storage space and thus cannot
   store large numbers of keys.  This is especially important because
   constrained networks are expected to consist of thousands of nodes.
   Protocols on the constrained level should keep this limitation in
   mind.

4.1.1.  Cross Level Support Protocols

   Protocols which operate between a constrained device on one side and
   the corresponding less constrained device on the other are considered
   to be (cross level) support protocols.  Protocols used between C and
   AM or RS and AS are therefore support protocols.

   Support protocols must consider the limitations of their constrained
   endpoint and therefore belong to the constrained level protocols.

4.2.  Less-Constrained Level Protocols

   A protocol is considered to be on the less-constrained level if it is
   used between the actors AM and AS.  AM and AS might belong to
   different security domains.

   On the less-constrained level, HTTP [RFC2616] and Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) [RFC5246] can be used instead of CoAP and DTLS.
   Moreover, existing security solutions for authentication and
   authorization such as the Web Authorization Protocol (OAuth)
   [RFC6749] and Kerberos [RFC4120] can likely be used without
   modifications and there are no limitations for the use of a Public
   Key Infrastructure (PKI).
