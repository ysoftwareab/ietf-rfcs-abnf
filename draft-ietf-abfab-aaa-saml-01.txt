Internet-Draft     An AAA Attribute for SAML Messages         March 2011


1.  Introduction

   The SAML-Message attribute has motivated by the requirements of the
   ABFAB architecture [I-D.lear-abfab-arch].  In this architecture, the
   attribute is used to convey Security Assertion Mark-up Language
   (SAML) messages between a SAML requester and responder.

   In the SAML model, the composition of such message exchanges with an
   underlying transport protocol is known as a SAML binding.  SAML
   already defines [OASIS.saml-bindings-2.0-os] a number of mainly HTTP-
   based bindings, principally (although by no means exclusively) for
   use with the SAML Web Browser Single Sign-On Profile
   [OASIS.saml-profiles-2.0-os].

   In the ABFAB architecture, AAA-based transport protocols are used to
   convey SAML messages.  This document defines a RADIUS attribute
   required for binding SAML to RADIUS [RFC2865] transport.  A draft
   document [1] exists that describes a proposed binding, but it has not
   yet been submitted to the OASIS Security Services Technical
   Committee.  This is pending conclusions on the following aspects of
   the ABFAB architecture:

   o  The use of the SAML attribute query at some arbitrary time after
      the initial EAP authentication exchange.

   o  The use of the SAML attribute query to obtain attributes for a
      principal from more than one attribute authority.

   o  Alignment with the Diameter ABFAB application
      [I-D.jones-diameter-abfab].

   This attribute is likely to be useful for other purposes besides
   ABFAB; an example of a potential application is SAML-based
   authorisation for network access.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  SAML Message Attribute

   This attribute contains a SAML [OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os] message.
   Where multiple SAML-Message attributes are included in a RADIUS
   message, the Message fields of these attributes are to be
   concatenated to form a single SAML message.

   A summary of the SAML-Message format is shown below.  The fields are
   transmitted from left to right.

                                    Figure 1

   Type:  TBD

   Length:  >=4

   Message:  The Message field is one or more octets containing a SAML
      message.  If larger than a single attribute, the SAML message data
      MUST be split on 253-octet boundaries over as many attributes as
      necessary.  The SAML message is reconstructed by concatenating the
      contents of all SAML-Message attributes.

4.  Security Considerations

   TODO

5.  IANA Considerations

   Assignments of additional enumerated values for the RADIUS attributes
   defined in this document are to be processed as described in
   [RFC3575], subject to the additional requirements of a published
   specification.
