               Resilient MPLS Rings using Segment Routing
                      draft-kompella-spring-rmr-01

Abstract

   This document describes the use of Segment Routing (SR) control plane
   to setup LSP(s) for resilient MPLS ring networks.  It specifies how
   clockwise and anti-clockwise ring LSP(s) are signaled using SR IGP
   protocol extensions, and how such ring LSP(s) are combined to achieve
   ring protection.

1.  Introduction

   Ring topologies are very common in transport networks, and are
   ubiquitous in access and aggregation networks.

   This draft introduces the necessary extensions to Segment Routing
   (SR) IGP signaling protocol(s) that are needed to establish Label
   Switched Paths (LSPs) for Resilient MPLS Rings (RMR).  An RMR LSP is
   a multipoint to point (MP2P) LSP that is signaled using SR control
   plane extensions to IGPs (e.g.  IS-IS or OSPF).

   SR as defined in [RFC8402] allows for a flexible definition of end-
   to-end paths within IGP topologies by encoding the SR path as a
   sequence of one or more topological sub-paths, or "segments".  Such

   segments can be advertised by link-state routing protocols such as
   IS-IS or OSPF.

   Rings are auto-discovered using the mechanisms described in the
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-rmr].  Signaling extensions for IS-IS and OSPF are
   introduced in [I-D.kompella-isis-ospf-rmr] to enable the auto-
   discovery of ring topologies.  After the ring topology is discovered,
   each node in the ring determines its Clockwise (CW) and Anti-
   clockwise (AC) ring neighbors and associated ring links.

   [I-D.ietf-teas-rsvp-rmr-extension] describes the necessary RSVP-TE
   [RFC3209] signaling protocol extensions that are needed to setup
   Resilient MPLS Ring (RMR) LSPs.  [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-rmr-extensions]
   describes extensions to LDP [RFC5036] signaling protocol that are
   needed for LDP setup RMR LSPs.

   This document describes how Segment Routing (SR) IGP control plane
   can be extended to allow for the setup of RMR LSPs and how a pair of
   CW and AC SR MPLS LSPs can provide the required protection for ring
   topologies.

   The first revisions of this document will focus on the simple most
   common ring topologies in access networks that do not include any
   "express links".  Future revisions of this document will expand on
   express link(s) for the more general rings.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.1.  Ring Taxonomy

   A ring consists of a subset of n nodes {R_i, 0 <= i < n}. The
   direction from node R_i to R_i+1 is defined as as "clockwise" (CW)
   and the reverse direction is defined as "anti-clockwise" (AC).  As
   there may be several rings in a graph, each ring is numbered with a
   distinct Ring ID (RID).

   The following terminology is used for rings:

   Ring ID (RID):
      A non-zero number that identifies a ring; this is unique in some
      scope of a Service Provider's network.  A node may belong to
      multiple rings, each identified by its unique RID

Internet-Draft                SR RMR Rings                     July 2019


   Ring Node:
      A member of a ring.  Note that a node may belong to several rings.

   Node Index:
      A logical numbering of nodes in a ring, from zero up to one less
      than the ring size.  Used purely for exposition in this document.

   Ring Master:
      The ring master initiates the ring identification process.
      Mastership is indicated in the IGP by a two-bit field.

   Ring Neighbors:
      Nodes whose indices differ by one (modulo ring size).

   Ring Size:
      The ring size for a given instantiation is N.  This can change as
      nodes are added or removed, or go up or down.

   Ring Links:
      Links that connect ring neighbors.

   Express Links:
      Links that connect non-neighboring ring nodes.

   Ring LSP:
      Each LSP in the ring is a multipoint to point LSP such that LSP
      can have multiple ingress nodes and one egress node.

   Ring Identification:
      The process of discovering ring nodes, ring links, link
      directions, and express links.

   Ring SID:
      Each ring node advertises 2 unique Ring Prefix Segment
      Identifiers(Ring SIDs).  CW ring SID is advertised by ring node to
      receive traffic in clockwise direction.  AC ring SID is advertised
      by ring node to receive traffic in anti-clockwise direction.

3.  Protocol extensions

   This section describes the necessary IGP protocol extensions to SR to
   allow signaling and establishing RMR LSP(s) to each node in a ring.

3.1.  SR Ring Capability

   A new sub-TLV is defined for SR RMR Ring Capability to advertise node
   support for signaling SR RMR LSP(s) using extensions in IS-IS and
   OSPF protocol(s).

   If the SR RMR Ring Capability is not advertised by a node, such node
   is considered not capable of establishing SR RMR LSP(s) using SR
   control plane extensions.

   The SR RMR Ring Capability sub-TLV has the following format:

    0                   1                   2                   3

3.1.1.  IS-IS SR RMR Ring Capabilities Sub-TLV

   In IS-IS, the Router Capability TLV TLV-242 defined in [RFC7981] is
   used to carry the SR RMR Ring Capability sub-TLV.

3.1.2.  OSPF SR RMR Ring Capabilities Sub-TLV

   In OSPF, a top-level TLV of the Router Information Opaque LSA
   (defined in [RFC7770]) is used to carry the SR RMR Ring Capability
   sub-TLV.

3.2.  SR Ring Prefix Segment Identifier (Ring-SID)

   In order to setup an SR RMR LSP(s) in CW and AC directions towards
   each node of the ring, this document defines a new Ring SR Prefix
   Segment Identifier (Ring-SID) sub-TLV.

   The Ring-SID sub-TLV carries the IGP Segment Routing Ring-SID that is
   associated with the advertised prefix by the node.  The Ring-SID is
   unique within a specific ring in an IGP domain.

   For IS-IS protocol, the Ring-SID MAY be present in any of the
   following TLVs:

      TLV-135 (Extended IPv4 reachability) defined in [RFC5305].

      TLV-236 (IPv6 IP Reachability) defined in [RFC5308].

      TLV-237 (Multitopology IPv6 IP Reachability) defined in [RFC5120].

   For OSPF protocol, the Ring-SID sub-TLV is carried as part of the
   OSPF Extended Prefix TLV defined in [RFC7684].

   The Ring-SID sub-TLV has the following format:

         Explicit-NULL label (0 for IPv4) before forwarding the packet.

      V-Flag:  Value/Index Flag.  If set, then the Prefix-SID carries an
         absolute value.  If not set, then the Ring-SID carries an
         index.

3.3.  Ring Segment Identifier (Ring-SID)

   An alternative means of propagating the CW and AC Ring SIDs is as a

   The rules for the propagation of a Ring-SID follow those dictated in
   [I-D.ietf-isis-segment-routing-extensions] and
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-segment-routing-extensions].

4.  Ring SR Signaling Procedures

4.1.  Ring SID Assignment

   As described in [I-D.ietf-mpls-rmr], a ring of RID r can be either
   configured on all nodes participating in ring r, or be configured on
   select master member ring node(s) while running other nodes in
   promiscuous mode.  All ring node(s) participating in a ring use the
   IGP extensions defined in [I-D.kompella-isis-ospf-rmr] to advertise
   their ring membership and to complete ring discovery and
   identification phase.

   A unique CW and AC Ring-SIDi(s) are assigned to a prefix on residing
   on each ring member node participating in the ring.

Internet-Draft                SR RMR Rings                     July 2019


4.1.1.  Static Ring-SID Assignment

   An operator can choose to statically assign and configure the unique
   CW and AC Ring-SID(s) associated with the prefixes residing on each
   member node of the ring.  In such case, it is expected that Ring-SID
   assignment and management becomes the responsibility of the network
   operator in order to ensure global uniqueness.

   When static provisioning of Ring-SID(s) on ring node(s) is
   implemented, the Ring-SID(s) sub-TLV(s) are explicitly advertised
   along with the prefix reachability advertisement.  Examples of such
   explicit advertisement(s) for prefix-SID(s) are given in
   [I-D.ietf-isis-segment-routing-extensions],
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-segment-routing-extensions], and
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-ospfv3-segment-routing-extensions].

4.1.2.  Ring-SID Assignment Using SRMS

   It is possible to leverage the Segment Routing Mapping Server (SRMS)
   functionality as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-ldp-interop] to assign, advertise,
   and manage Ring-SID(s) on behalf of all ring nodes in the network.
   This simplifies the burden on the operator to provision rings and
   Ring-SID(s) on network ring nodes, by restricting configuration to
   only select nodes in the ring (e.g. master node(s)).

   The SRMS functionality consists of two functional blocks: a Mapping
   Server (MS) and a Mapping Client (MC).  The SR MS functionality
   supports the advertisement of prefix-SID(s) to a prefix without the
   need to explicitly advertise such assignment within a prefix
   reachability advertisement.  This document extends the MS
   functionality to allow it to advertise the Ring-SID to prefix mapping
   in a similar fashion.

   The SR MC is any node that receives and uses the MS mapping
   advertisements.  The MC interprets the SR mapping Ring-SID
   advertisement as an assignment of a Ring-SID to a prefix.  Note that
   the SRMS node can serve as both an MS and an MC.

   To implement the SRMS for assigning and managing Ring-SID(s), the
   network operator reserves a block of SR Ring SID indices and
   delegates it to the SRMS.

   When a ring of RID r is configured/enabled on a ring master node, the
   SRMS learns of ring nodes participating in ring RID r using the ring
   node TLV defined in [I-D.kompella-isis-ospf-rmr].  Whenever the SRMS
   discovers a new ring node, it automatically assigns two unique Ring-

Internet-Draft                SR RMR Rings                     July 2019


   SID(s)- for CW and AC Ring-SID LSP(s) - from the available SID(s)
   within the Ring SID block available on the SRMS.

   After CW and AC Ring-SID(s) are assigned to a ring node prefix, the
   SRMS can advertises the Ring-SID sub-TLV in a SID/label binding TLV
   as described in [I-D.ietf-isis-segment-routing-extensions] and
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-segment-routing-extensions].

4.1.3.  Ring-SID Assignment Using DHCP

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is uniquely well-suited for
   handling node and ring SID assignments.  When ring directions have
   been established for all links in the ring, each node can request, as
   a DHCP client, a pair of ring SIDs.  The DHCP server responds with
   two unique values from the SID block(s) for Ring SIDs with which it
   has been configured.  The DHCP server SHOULD be configured with very
   long leases for such assignments, as well as "sticky" assignments;
   that is, should a lease expire, the pair of values assigned should
   not be offered to another client unless the server has run out of
   ring SID values; also, should the same client re-request ring SIDs,
   the server should return the same SIDs if at all possible.

   Further details are provided in [I-D.kompella-spring-dhcp].

4.2.  Ring SID LSP Setup

   Any ring node that receives a Ring-SID advertisement either part of
   an explicit prefix TLV advertisement or part of a SID/label binding
   TLV advertised by the SRMS will perform the following depending on
   ring node role.

4.2.1.  Egress Ring Node

   An node that is member of a ring RID r can advertise a Ring-SID sub-
   TLV associated with local prefix.  If the node learns of a Ring-SID
   sub-TLV associated to local prefix using the SID/label binding TLV
   advertised by the SRMS, the node first verify it is member of ring
   indicated in the Ring-SID sub-TLV.  If not, the node does not process
   the Ring-SID sub-TLV any further.

   Otherwise, when the node is member of the ring indicated in the Ring-
   SID sub-TLV it ensures that the corresponding local MPLS label from
   its SRGB is assigned and bound to the specific local prefix and RID.
   If no pen-ultimate hop popping is desired, an egress Incoming Label
   Map (ILM) entry corresponding for the corresponding local label is
   installed in the forwarding table as usual.

4.2.2.  Ingress and Transit Ring Nodes

   An ingress or transit node that receives a Ring-SID sub-TLV
   advertisement for a remote prefix through an explicit prefix TLV
   advertisement, or through a SID/label binding TLV for a remote prefix
   will first verify that it is member of the ring indicated in the
   Ring-SID sub-TLV advertisement before processing it any further.

   If the ingress or transit node are is not member of the Ring-SID's
   ring, the node MUST not process the Ring-SID any further.  Otherwise,
   if the ingress or transit node is member of the ring indicated in the
   Ring-SID, the ingress or transit node ensures that the corresponding
   local MPLS label in its SRGB is assigned and bound to the specific
   remote prefix and for the specific ring.

   As described in Section 3.2, the Ring-SID sub-TLV carries an
   Algorithm identifier that indicates the procedure to derive the set
   of next-hop(s) to reach a CW or AC neighbor.  The default algorithm
   (Algorithm 0) is to include all next-hop(s)/links between itself and
   the respective downstream neighbor.  The D-Flag in the Flags field
   within the Ring-SID sub-TLV indicates whether the CW or AC downstream
   neighbors are intended.

   An operator may make use of other user-defined Algorithms to allow a
   ingress or transit ring node to select specific link(s)/neighbors
   that connect to the downstream CW or AC neighbor.

   Once the CW and AC next-hop(s) are determined, the ingress or transit
   router(s) of the RMR ring LSP add the corresponding ILM entries for
   the CW and AC labels and map each to the set of CW and AC Next-hop
   Label Forwarding Entries (NHLFE)s.

4.2.3.  Protection and Fastreroute

   The ingress or a transit node that receives a Ring-SID advertisement
   from a remote ring node, in addition to assigning and programming the
   primary CW or AC next-hop(s) as described in the previous section,
   assigns the opposite direction AC or CW next-hop and its associated
   AC or CW Ring-SID as a backup path.

   Upon failure, the ingress or a transit router that detects a local
   link failure of the Ring-SID's primary next-hop, immediately diverts
   traffic on to the pre-programmed backup next-hop of the Ring-SID.
   Traffic originally flowing in a CW or AC direction will be diverted
   to flow on to flow in the AC or CW direction after the failure.

   In case of a failure at a transit ring node along the path of a Ring-
   SID, any upstream router that learns of the downstream link failure

   via IGP link updates, can locally reroute(s) the traffic towards the
   backup next-hop.  This optimizes the repair path and avoids packets
   from being unnecessarily forwarded to the ring node where local fault
   occurred, and the be looped back on the opposite Ring-SID due to the
   fault.

5.  IANA Considerations

   TODO.

6.  Security Considerations

   It is not anticipated the extensions to IGP SR protocols described in
   this document may introduce additional security risk(s).  Future
   revisions of this document will update this section with details
   about those risks.
