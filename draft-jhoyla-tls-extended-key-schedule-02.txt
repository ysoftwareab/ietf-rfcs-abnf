                     TLS 1.3 Extended Key Schedule
               draft-jhoyla-tls-extended-key-schedule-02

Abstract

   TLS 1.3 is sometimes used in situations where it is necessary to
   inject extra key material into the handshake.  This draft aims to
   describe methods for doing so securely.  This key material must be
   injected in such a way that both parties agree on what is being
   injected and why, and further, in what order.

1.  Introduction

   Introducing additional key material into the TLS handshake is a non-
   trivial process because both parties need to agree on the injection
   content and context.  If the two parties do not agree then an
   attacker may exploit the mismatch in so-called channel
   synchronization attacks, such as those described by [SLOTH].

   Injecting key material into the TLS handshake allows other protocols
   to be bound to the handshake.  For example, it may provide additional
   protections to the ClientHello message, which in the standard TLS
   handshake only receives protections after the server's Finished
   message has been received.  It may also permit the use of combined
   shared secrets, possibly from multiple key exchange algorithms, to be
   included in the key schedule.  This pattern is common for Post
   Quantum key exchange algorithms, as discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-tls-hybrid-design].

Internet-Draft        TLS 1.3 Extended Key Schedule       September 2020


   The goal of this document is to provide a standardised way for
   binding extra context into TLS 1.3 handshakes in a way that is easy
   to analyse from a security perspective, reducing the need for
   security analysis of extensions that affect the key schedule.  It
   separates the concerns of whether an extension achieves its goals
   from the concerns of whether an extension reduces the security of a
   TLS handshake, either directly or through some unforseen interaction
   with another extension.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Key Schedule Extension

   This section describes two places in which additional secrets can be
   injected into the TLS 1.3 key schedule.

3.1.  Handshake Secret Injection

   To inject extra key material into the Handshake Secret it is
   recommended to prefix it, inside an appropriate frame, to the
   "(EC)DHE" input, where "||" represents concatenation.

                                    |
                                    v
                              Derive-Secret(., "derived", "")
                                    |
                                    v
     KeyScheduleInput || (EC)DHE -> HKDF-Extract = Handshake Secret
                                    |
                                    v

3.2.  Main Secret Injection

   To inject key material into the Main Secret it is recommended to
   prefix it, inside an appropriate frame, to the "0" input.

                              |
                              v
                        Derive-Secret(., "derived", "")
                              |
                              v
     KeyScheduleInput || 0 -> HKDF-Extract = Main Secret
                              |
                              v

   This structure mirrors the Handshake Injection point.

4.  Key Schedule Injection Negotiation

   Applications which make use of additional key schedule inputs MUST
   define a mechanism for negotiating the content and type of that
   input.  This input MUST be framed in a KeyScheduleSecret struct, as
   defined in Section 5.  Applications must take care that any
   negotiation that takes place unambiguously agrees a secret.  It must
   be impossible, even under adversarial conditions, that a client and
   server agree on the transcript of the negotiation, but disagree on
   the secret that was negotiated.

5.  Key Schedule Extension Structure

   In some cases, protocols may require more than one secret to be
   injected at a particular stage in the key schedule.  Thus, we require
   a generic and extensible way of doing so.  To accomplish this, we use
   a structure - KeyScheduleInput - that encodes well-ordered sequences
   of secret material to inject into the key schedule.  KeyScheduleInput
   is defined as follows:

   struct {
       KeyScheduleSecretType type;
       opaque secret_data<0..2^16-1>;
   } KeyScheduleSecret;

   enum {
       (65535)
   } KeyScheduleSecretType;

   struct {
       KeyScheduleSecret secrets<0..2^16-1>;
   } KeyScheduleInput;

   Each secret included in a KeyScheduleInput structure has a type and
   corresponding secret data.  Each secret MUST have a unique
   KeyScheduleSecretType.  When encoding KeyScheduleInput as the key
   schedule Input value, the KeyScheduleSecret values MUST be in

   ascending sorted order.  This ensures that endpoints always encode
   the same KeyScheduleInput value when using the same secret keying
   material.

6.  Security Considerations

   [BINDEL] provides a proof that the concatenation approach in
   Section 3 is secure as long as either the concatenated secret is
   secure or the existing KDF input is secure.

   [[OPEN ISSUE: Is this guarantee sufficient?  Do we also need to
   guarantee that a malicious prefix can't weaken the resulting PRF
   output?]]

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the creation of a new IANA registry: TLS
   KeyScheduleInput Types.  This registry should be under the existing
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) Parameters heading.  It should be
   administered under a Specification Required policy [RFC8126].

   [[OPEN ISSUE: specify initial registry values]]

               | Value | Description | DTLS-OK | Reference |
