Abstract

   Mobile IPv6 does not allow a mobile node to hide its location from a
   correspondent node without compromising optimized routing.  Hence, a
   mobile node has the choice: it can either get location privacy
   support or short packet delay, but not both at the same time.  This
   document discusses the problem of achieving both simultaneously and
   specifies a solution.  The solution utilizes the Mobile IPv6
   bootstrapping mechanisms and does neither introduce new network
   entities nor changes to home agent or correspondent node
   implementations.

1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].

   General mobility terminology can be found in [5].  Terminology
   specific to Mobile IPv6 and Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping can be found in
   [2] and [6].  Additionally, the following terms are introduced:

   Correspondent node-targeted location privacy:  Hiding the mobile
      node's location from the correspondent node

   Eavesdropper-targeted location privacy:  Hiding the mobile node's
      location from nodes eavesdropping on the path between mobile node
      and correspondent node

   IP Reachability Home Agent (IRHA):  A Mobile IPv6 home agent as
      specified in [2] that provides IP reachability and global session
      continuity for the mobile node.

   Home Address for IP Reachability (HoA_IR):  A Mobile IPv6 home
      address used for IP reachability and session continuity and that
      is anchored at the IRHA.  This home address is independent of the
      location of the mobile node and is disclosed to potential
      correspondent nodes (e.g., by publishing the address in DNS).

   Optimized path:  A path between mobile node and correspondent node
      that is shorter than the path between mobile node and
      correspondent node when the mobile node uses bi-directional
      tunneling mode to the IRHA.  Note that the optimized path may be
      longer than the path between mobile node and correspondent node
      when the mobile node uses route optimization mode.

   Optimized routing:  Routing data packets over the optimized path

   Optimized Routing Home Agent (ORHA):  A Mobile IPv6 home agent as
      specified in [2] that is used for providing optimized routing and
      correspondent node-targeted location privacy.  It must support the
      bootstrapping mechanisms specified in [3] and should be located
      close to the correspondent node.

   Home Address for Optimized Routing (HoA_OR):  A Mobile IPv6 home
      address used for optimized routing and session continuity that is
      anchored at the ORHA.  This home address is typically not public
      (i.e., not published in DNS).

2.  Introduction and Problem Definition

   Location privacy is the ability to hide a user's location from other
   users.  This is considered to be an important feature, since
   disclosure of the location can have serious impacts on the user's
   life.  In general, location privacy can be achieved by hiding the
   relation between identity and location of a user.  In Mobile IPv6
   [2], the care-of address and the home address typically represent
   topological location and identity of a mobile node, respectively.
   Even though a dynamically assigned home address may not represent a
   permanent identity itself, a mapping to a mobile node's permanent
   identifiers is typically published for IP reachability reasons (e.g.,
   in DNS).  Consequently, in Mobile IPv6 at least either the care-of
   address or the home address must be hidden from anyone that is not
   authorized to obtain the location of the mobile node.  Two rather
   orthogonal sub-problems of location privacy for Mobile IPv6 can be
   identified: hiding the location from eavesdroppers on the path and
   hiding the location from the correspondent node [7], which we
   henceforth call eavesdropper-targeted and correspondent node-targeted
   location privacy, respectively.  This document is concerned with
   correspondent node-targeted location privacy only, especially with
   the problem of providing optimized routing at the same time.
   Eavesdropper-targeted location privacy is out of scope of this
   document.  However, it is expected that the mechanisms defined in
   this document can be combined with solutions for eavesdropper-
   targeted location privacy such as the pseudo home address mechanisms
   specified in [11].  Any location privacy issues not related to Mobile
   IPv6 are out of the scope of this document.

   An example scenario illustrating the problem addressed by this
   document is the following: A mobile node wants to hide its location
   from correspondent nodes and uses Mobile IPv6 with a public home
   address to be reachable.  The public home address is anchored at a
   home agent, which we henceforth call IRHA.  The mobile node requires
   strong location privacy, i.e., hiding only the mobility within an
   access network and revealing the access network prefix to the
   correspondent node is not acceptable.  An application on the
   correspondent node initiates a delay-sensitive session with the
   mobile node such as a VoIP call by sending packets to the mobile
   node's public home address (HoA_IR).  This requires that the
   correspondent node has obtained the mobile node's home address
   beforehand, e.g., from DNS.  The mobile node receives the packets in
   bi-directional tunneling mode from its home agent (IRHA) and then may
   decide to switch to route optimization mode for the session.  Let's
   assume the mobile node is located in the United States and the
   correspondent node is located in Canada, whereas the mobile node's
   home agent is located in Europe.  Since the mobile node is far away
   from home, the packet delay and hence the user experience is far from

   what could be achieved.  However, if the mobile node uses route
   optimization mode, it reveals its CoA and hence its location to the
   correspondent node (note that the correspondent node can also be an
   attacker that just initiates a session to find out the mobile node's
   location).  Consequently, the mobile node has the choice: it can
   either have good VoIP call quality without location privacy or
   location privacy with bad VoIP call quality.  Currently, there is no
   way to achieve both simultaneously with Mobile IPv6.

   This document proposes a mechanism that can provide both
   simultaneously, i.e., strong correspondent node-targeted location
   privacy and optimized routing.  Home agents and correspondent node
   are unchanged and no new entities or messages are introduced.  The
   basic idea is that the mobile node bootstraps with a home agent
   located topologically close to the correspondent node and which is
   used for optimized communication with this correspondent node.  Such
   home agent is henceforth called ORHA.  A home agent location close to
   the correspondent node ensures that the route in bi-directional
   tunneling mode is short and that no location information is contained
   in the home address, as opposed to a home address anchored at a local
   home agent.  For mobile node-initiated sessions, the mobile node uses
   the ORHA in bi-directional tunneling mode and HoA_OR on higher
   layers.  For correspondent node-initiated sessions, the public home
   address HoA_IR is used on higher layers and the mobile node registers
   the HoA_OR as care-of address at the correspondent node.

3.  Applicability Statement

   The solution described in this document relies on the assignment or
   discovery of an home agent in the vicinity of the correspondent node
   or at an appropriate location that is uncorrelated with the location
   of the point of attachment of the mobile node.  In deployment
   scenarios where such a home agent does not exist or if the
   establishment of security associations with such home agent is not
   feasible (e.g., because the mobile node's Mobility Service Authorizer
   does not have any relationship with the provider Mobility Service
   Provider of the home agent), this solution is not applicable.
   Furthermore, the mechanisms defined in this document should only be
   used in scenarios where the number of concurrent sessions that a
   mobile node runs and that require simultaneous optimized routing and
   correspondent node-targeted location privacy is low.

   The application of the HA discovery mechanisms as specified in the
   MIP6 bootstrapping documents [3] [8] to ORHA discovery may pose
   special requirements on deployment.  If the DNS-based HA discovery
   scheme shall be used for ORHA discovery, MSAs or MSPs should maintain
   DNS entries that allow the MN to discover a home agent at a specific
   location or in a specific domain.  There are different ways to
   achieve that.  For instance, the mobile node's MSA may maintain DNS
   entries per CN domain according to the scheme
   "_mip6._ipv6.CNdomain.MSAdomain.com" and the mobile node may be
   configured to construct the FQDN for ORHA discovery by appending the
   string "_mip6._ipv6.", CN's domain name, and MSA's domain name.  If
   the DHCP-based HA discovery scheme [9] shall be used for ORHA
   discovery, the mobile node should be able to request a home agent
   using DHCP once a session with a new CN begins, i.e., potentially
   long after completion of the network authentication.  Therefore, the
   ASP should support either storing the HA information received from
   the mobile node's MSA for as long as the mobile node is attached to
   the ASP or requesting HA information from the MSA for a specific
   target domain during the mobile node session (see section 4.2 of
   [9]).

4.  Related work

   Qui et. al. [11] propose a solution to the correspondent node-
   targeted location privacy problem.  The basic idea is to hide the
   home address from the correspondent node in route optimization mode
   by using a pseudo home address instead of the real home address.
   Although the care-of address is revealed to the correspondent node,
   location privacy is protected by hiding the identity (i.e., real home
   address) of the mobile node from the correspondent node.  This
   approach has also been proposed in [10].  However, if the
   correspondent node initiates the communication location privacy is
   compromised, since the public home address and hence the identity of
   the mobile node is typically already known by the correspondent node.
   And even if the real home address can be hidden from the
   correspondent node, location privacy is compromised if the
   correspondent node is able to figure out the mobile node's identity
   by any other means (e.g., during the conversation of a voice call or
   by higher layer identifiers).

   [3] and [8] specify the mechanisms for Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping in
   the split and the integrated scenario, respectively.  They allow a
   mobile node to bootstrap with any home agent, for which the necessary
   trust relationships are in place.  When bootstrapping with a local
   home agent, optimized routing can be achieved in bi-directional
   tunneling mode by using the home address pertaining to the local home
   agent for the session with the correspondent node.  However, since
   the home address obtained from a local home agent belongs to the
   network the mobile node is currently visiting, it contains location
   information.  Consequently, location privacy is compromised, if the
   correspondent node knows that the home agent is local to the mobile
   node (see security considerations of [3]).  Although in many cases
   the correspondent node will not know, there are cases where the
   correspondent node can find out whether the mobile node's home agent
   is local or remote.  For instance, a correspondent node may know that
   a mobile node's home agent is local because the mobile node's
   Mobility Service Provider (MSP) is known to always assign local home
   agents for routing efficiency reasons.

5.  Changes to Mobile Node Operation

   This section describes a mechanism that allows a Mobile IPv6 mobile
   node to achieve both correspondent node-targeted location privacy and
   optimized routing simultaneously.  The mobile node operation is split
   in two cases: route optimization for new sessions (i.e.,
   communication sessions that have not yet started) and route
   optimization for ongoing sessions.  The first case applies, e.g., if
   the mobile nodes wants to initiate a session with a correspondent
   node and decides to optimized the route before sending the first data
   packets.  The second case applies, e.g., if the correspondent node
   initiates a session with the mobile node or if the mobile node
   decides to optimize the route of an ongoing session.  A session is
   defined by an application or transport layer context bound to the IP
   addresses of the two endpoints, with one of the addresses being the
   mobile node's home address to achieve session continuity.

5.1.  Route Optimization for New Sessions

   The mobile node first tries to discover an ORHA as described in
   Section 6.  If the discovery is successful, the mobile node
   bootstraps with the ORHA, obtains a home address HoA_OR, and uses the
   ORHA in bi-directional tunneling mode for communication with the
   correspondent node.  Existing registrations with other home agents
   can be kept for communication with other correspondent nodes.  Since
   the mobile node can continue to use the public home address HoA_IR
   for IP reachability, the HoA_OR does not need to be published, i.e.,
   no DNS update needs to be triggered for this home address.  An
   exemplary signaling flow is shown in Figure 1.

   HoA_OR is the only address that is revealed to the correspondent
   node, strong correspondent node-targeted location privacy is ensured.

5.2.  Route Optimization for Ongoing Sessions

   After the mobile node has decided to optimize the route of a session
   (e.g., after receiving the first data packets from the correspondent
   node tunneled through the IRHA), the mobile node tries to discover an
   ORHA as described in Section 6.  If this is successful, it bootstraps
   with this ORHA and obtains HoA_OR.  Since the ongoing communication
   session is bound to HoA_IR, packets sent by the correspondent node
   are still routed through the IRHA.  To optimize the route without
   compromising location privacy, the mobile node moves the session to
   the ORHA.  Therefore, the mobile node switches to route optimization
   mode and sends care-of test messages, binding update messages, and
   later data packets destined for the correspondent node over the
   reverse tunnel to the ORHA.  The mobile node uses HoA_IR as home
   address and HoA_OR as care-of address in the context of this route
   optimization mode, i.e., headers of care-of test messages, binding
   update messages, and data packets are as follows (IPsec for signaling
   protection to ORHA assumed):


   Care-of Test Init:

         IPv6 header (source = care-of address,
                      destination = ORHA)
         ESP header in tunnel mode
         IPv6 header (source = HoA_OR,
                      destination = correspondent node address)
         Any protocol




   Data packets and binding updates:

         IPv6 header (source = care-of address,
                      destination = ORHA)
         ESP header in tunnel mode
         IPv6 header (source = HoA_OR,
                      destination = correspondent node address)
         Destination Options header
            Home Address option (HoA_IR)
         Any protocol

   Since HoA_OR is the mobile node's care-of address and the HoA_IR is
   the mobile node's home address from the correspondent node's point of
   view, data packets sent by the correspondent node contain the HoA_IR
   in the routing header and the HoA_OR in the destination address field
   of the IP header.  Consequently, data packets sent by the
   correspondent node are routed to the ORHA and tunneled to the mobile
   node.  An exemplary signaling flow is shown in Figure 2.

   Location privacy is provided, since the correspondent node only
   learns HoA_OR and HoA_IR, which both do not contain any information
   about the mobile node's location.  Optimized routing is provided as
   well, since all data packets exchanged between mobile node and
   correspondent node are routed over the ORHA, which is located close
   to the correspondent node.

   Note that upon changing the care-of address, the mobile node does not
   need to send a binding update message to the correspondent node over
   the reverse tunnel to the ORHA, because the mobile node's care-of
   address in this context is the HoA_OR.

5.3.  Route Optimization Mode Selection

   The mobile node has to decide for every correspondent node, whether
   it wants to use bi-directional tunneling mode, route optimization
   mode or the mechanisms described in this document.  How this decision
   is made and when route optimization according to this document is
   triggered is implementation specific and hence out of scope of this
   document.  Generally, bi-directional tunneling to the home agent
   achieves strong correspondent node-targeted location privacy and is
   sufficient for non-delay-sensitive services such as simple web
   browsing.  If no location privacy is required, Mobile IPv6 route
   optimization mode can be used.

   Since the number of simultaneous registrations at different home
   agents has impacts on the overall signaling overhead and resource
   consumption on the mobile node, the mobile node should try to
   minimize the number of simultaneously used ORHAs and only apply the
   mechanisms specified in this document for sessions that really
   require simultaneous optimized routing and correspondent node-
   targeted location privacy.

5.4.  Source Address Selection

   The mobile node may use different home addresses for communication
   with different correspondent nodes when using the route optimization
   mechanisms defined in this document.  Hence, the mobile node must be
   able to select the right home address as source address for packets
   to be sent to a specific destination address.  This can be achieved
   with the source address selection mechanisms defined in [4].  If the
   ORHA is located in the correspondent node's domain, the prefix of the
   home address anchored at the ORHA is similar to the prefix of the
   correspondent node and rule 9 (Use longest matching prefix) of the
   default source address selection [4] applies.  For other cases,
   dynamically adding entries for HoA_OR and correspondent node address
   with matching labels in the policy table [4] when route optimization
   according to this document is triggered would prefer a home address
   as source address for communication with a specific correspondent
   node.  However, since this is implementation specific, the details of
   the source address selection are out of the scope of this document.

6.  Location-dependent Home Agent Discovery

   The mechanisms defined in Section 5.1 and Section 5.2 require the
   discovery or assignment of a home agent (ORHA) located close to a
   correspondent node.  One option to achieve that is to pre-configure a
   list of home agent FQDNs and distances to various prefixes on the
   mobile node.  However, since the list of available home agents and
   the distances may change, a dynamic discovery of ORHAs is preferable.
   There are various ways for achieving this, some of them are described
   in the following.

   One option is to re-use the DNS-based home agent discovery specified
   in [3].  The mobile node would construct the FQDN based on the
   correspondent node's address, prefix or host name.  Some operator
   (e.g., MSA, ASP or MSP) should maintain DNS entries that allow the MN
   to discover a home agent at a specific location or in a specific
   domain.  For instance, the mobile node's MSA may maintain DNS entries
   per CN domain according to the scheme
   "_mip6._ipv6.CNdomain.MSAdomain.com" and the mobile node may be
   configured to construct the FQDN for ORHA discovery by appending the
   string "_mip6._ipv6.", CN's domain name, and MSA's domain name.

   Another option is to re-using DHCP-based HA assignment as defined in
   [8] and [9].  For instance, the MSA would send the home agent
   information for all the MSPs which the mobile node is authorized to
   use to the Network Access Server (NAS) during network authentication.
   Once the mobile node intends to initiate route optimization according
   to this document, it sends a DHCP Information Request and appends a
   Home Network Identifier Option [9] containing the correspondent
   node's domain as target domain.  The id-type can be set to 2 or to a
   new value specifically defined for ORHA discovery.  The NAS would
   then select a home agent from the set of authorized home agents that
   is close to the target domain.  How this selection is done is out of
   scope of this document.  Finally, the NAS would assign the selected
   home agent to the mobile node in the Home Network Information Option
   of the DHCP reply message.

   Anycast-based home agent discovery using IKEv2 [12] or DHAAD [2] is
   another possible solution.  The mobile node would construct the
   anycast destination address based on the correspondent node's prefix.
   A drawback of this method is that it cannot discover ORHAs located
   close to, but outside the correspondent node's network.

   Finally, the mobile node could query a dedicated server using some
   application-layer protocol like http.  The server would maintain the
   list of ORHAs and would reply with the name of an ORHA upon receiving
   a request with a correspondent node's prefix.  This server can, e.g.,
   be provided by the MSA or a third party in the public Internet.

7.  Security Considerations

   The solution specified in this document ensures that a correspondent
   node at most learns the home addresses HoA_OR and HoA_IR of the
   mobile node.  HoA_IR is used for IP reachability and is independent
   of the mobile node's movement.  Hence, it doesn't contain any
   information about the mobile node's current location.  HoA_OR is
   anchored at a home agent located close to the correspondent node and
   thus there is no relation between HoA_OR and the mobile node's
   current location.  Consequently, the correspondent node has no way to
   infer the mobile node's location or movement, i.e., correspondent
   node-targeted location privacy is guaranteed.  However, the
   correspondent node may wrongly believe that mobile node has moved
   close to himself once the mobile node bootstraps with an ORHA and
   moves the session from IRHA to ORHA as described in Section 5.2.
   However, since the decision to optimize an ongoing session is
   independent of the mobile node's movement, the correspondent node
   cannot infer anything about the mobile node's real movement patterns
   from this.

   An attacker could initiate many faked communication sessions with
   spoofed source addresses in order to trigger the mobile node to
   discover and bootstrap with many different ORHAs.  This could consume
   significant resources on the mobile node and in the network and may
   cause a DoS.  As a countermeasure, the mobile node should not start
   bootstrapping with a new ORHA just because it receives packets from a
   new correspondent node or it should limit the number of
   simultaneously used ORHAs.  Faked sessions should be identified as
   such as quickly as possible and the mobile node should de-register
   immediately from ORHAs once a session is identified as a fake
   session.

   The ORHA knows the location of the mobile node and could distribute
   it to third parties without authorization from the mobile node.
   Hence, the mobile node must be sure that the ORHA is trusted before
   the mobile node reveals its location to the ORHA.  How the trust
   verification is done depends on the ORHA discovery mechanism in use.
   One option is that the MSA knows which home agents are trusted with
   respect to location privacy and only assigns such home agents to the
   mobile node.  The MSA could also deny the authorization request if
   the MN tries to bootstrap with an untrusted home agent.  Another
   option is that the mobile node verifies the trust by itself, e.g., by
   pre-configuring a list of trusted home agent addresses on the mobile
   node or by using certificates.  Note that the fact that the ORHA and
   the correspondent node may be in the same administrative domain
   doesn't imply that the ORHA reveals the mobile node's location to the
   correspondent node.  This is also true in today's cellular networks,
   where it is ensured that users of a service provided by a particular

   mobile operator don't know the location of other users using a
   service provided by the same operator.

   The return routability procedure over the reverse tunnel to the ORHA
   is not considered less secure than the standard return routability
   procedure as long as the ORHA is trusted and the ORHA link is not
   vulnerable to eavesdropping.
