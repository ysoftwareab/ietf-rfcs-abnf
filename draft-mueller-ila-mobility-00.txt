Mobility Management for 5G Network Architectures Using Identifier-locator Addressing
                     draft-mueller-ila-mobility-00


Abstract

   This specification describes Mobility Management Architecture for 5G
   Networks Using Identifier-Locator Addressing in IPv6 for virtualized
   mobile telecommunication networks. Identifier-locator addressing
   differentiates between location and identity of a network node. The
   approach presented in this draft enables mobility management on Layer
   3, and provides a simplified and more efficient architecture with
   less core network utilization compared to traditional architecture.

1  Introduction and Problem Statement

   Mobility has been a challenge for IP based network since the area of
   smartphones began. One challenge is to ensure seamless and
   transparent mobility for mobile devices among different locations and
   in between several Radio Access Technologies. More complexity has
   been added through Cloud computing and virtualization in which
   services might change their physical location within a virtualized
   architecture, too. In regards of current research and develpment on
   Mobile Edge Cloud and 5G, high availability, low delay and ultra high
   bandwidth requirements are required for a massive amount of
   communuicating instances ranging from cellulars, high-definition
   multimedia streaming, Internet-of-Things (IoT), critical
   infrastructures among others.

   IP has been overloaded and used at teh same time for locator and
   identifier. requirements: efficient routing, scalability, mobility,
   security lead changesin the design principles on decoupling Locator-
   Identifier wihtin IP.

   This specification describes Mobility Management Architecture for 5G
   Networks Using Identifier-Locator Addressing (ILA) ([nvo3]) in IPv6
   for virtualized mobile telecommunication networks. Identifier-locator
   ([nvo3]) addressing differentiates between location and identity of a
   network node. The approach presented in this draft enables mobility
   management on Layer 3, provides a simplified and more efficient
   architecture, less core network utilization.

   The concept of ILA extends the Identifier-Locator Network Protocol
   (ILNP) ([RFC6740], [RFC6741]) defines a protocol and operations model
   for   identifier-locator addressing in IPv6.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The following terminology will be referred to in the document.


   * ILA ID or only ID: unique identifier in ILA terms - not used public
     and only used for GUTI creation for each new attachment. The
     International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) can be used for ID
     generation.

   * ILA host: An end host that is capable of performing ILA
     translations for both sending and receiving. An ILA host uses the

     ILA resolver protocol to get identifier	to locator mappings for
     destinations in communication.	 		 		
   * ILA router: A network device that performs ILA translations. ILA
     routers participate	 		 in a mapping distribution protocol.

   * Globally Unique Temporary UE Identity (GUTI): temporary address
     considered as a temporary ILA ID.

   * ILA Locator (LOC): either International Mobile Equipment Identity
     (IMEI) or an IP address that has been assigned to a single UE.

   * User Equipment (UE): device with identifier such as a mobile phone
     or IoT gateway.

   * Access Point (AP): Base station, evolved-NodeB (eNB) in 4G.

   * Gateway (GW): Gateway, e.g. Serving-Gateway (SWG) or Packet-Data-
     Network-Gateway (PGW) in 4G.

   * Application Function (AF): refers to the 3GPP terminology and
     stands for any IP service.


2  Motivation There is increasing demand for improved connectivity for a
   growing number of devices including IoT,	mobile phones, cars, etc. 5G
   networking is intended to address access and core bottlenecks to
   provide for lower lower latency, higher throughput, and greater
   number of connected devices.	 		 There are several challenges in
   applying Mobile-Edge-Computing (MEC) concepts due to Layer 2
   tunneling and signaling overhead.	 		 The following architecture is
   based on a layer 3 design that obviates the need for layer 2
   tunneling and signaling overhead. The design decisions and call flow
   outline an approach using ILA for mobility management in 5G networks
   that overcomes challenges of legacy networks.	A flatter network
   architecture as well as optimizations in the data and control path
   are presented, which result in a shorter communication path and
   therefore lower delay. 		


3  Related Work, Protocols and Concepts This section provides an
   overview on of the state-of-the-art on related Work, protocols and
   concepts for mobility management on mobile networks. In particular
   the 4th Generation (4G) of mobile telecommunication networks has been
   taken into comparison for this draft. 


3.1 Mobile IPv6 The IETF specified Mobile IPv6 to ensure connectivity
   and reachability in case of client mobilty within an IPv6 network.
 


Mueller, Herbert        Expires January 7. 2017                 [Page 5]

INTERNET DRAFT        <draft-mueller-ila-mobility>                      


   Mobility is solved by assigning an additional IPv6 address - the
   Care-of-Address (CoA) - next to the current IPv6 address that as been
   assigned in the home network. Therefore a UE is equipped with a home
   address, plus primary CoA in case of foreign network attachment. IPv6
   is classified as host-based mobility protocol, due to the fact, that
   the UE is in charge of announcing its mobility to the network. In
   particular it is the clientresponsibility for signalling binding
   update signaling to HA. In order to ensure reachability, the UE
   communicates its new assigned CoA to the Home Agent, which acts as a
   router and registrar for UEs. Connection requests are intercepted and
   re-routed in case CoA entries for a UE exists. A tunnel is
   established between the UE at the CoA and the HA for securely
   exchanging packets. Per default, the first packet is routed from the
   correspondent UE towards CoA of the UE via the HA. All consecutive
   packets will follow on the same path, which might include a detour,
   but hides the new location of the UE for privacy reasons. The feature
   of route optimization allows the UE to directly contact the
   correspondent UE, therefore cuts out the HA from the communication
   path and forwards packets on a shorter route. Security of the Mobile
   IPv6 is enhanced through IPSec for binding updates to avoid spoofing
   of CoA for a UE.


3.2 Proxy MobileIPv6 The IETF specified Proxy Mobile IPv6 provides
   network-based mobility management for UE and extends the Mobile IPv6
   in the way, that host-based mobility management functionalities in
   Mobile IPv6 are excluded from the client into the network in Proxy
   Mobile IPv6. The Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) acts as topological
   anchor point and manages the UE's binding state. The Mobile Access
   Gateway (MAG) manages the mobility-related signaling on behalf of a
   UE at the access router. It is responsible for tracking the UE's
   movements to and from the access link for signaling the UE's local
   mobility anchor.


3.3 Host Identity Protocol (HIP) HIP ([hip]) is provising a secure
   solution for identifier/locator-split by adding a new host identity
   layer into protocol stack. A cryptographic namespace build upon a
   host identity as public key allows scalability and multi-homing
   within the network. An extensions of DNS supports rendezvous server
   functioanlity for secure host identity lookup. A secure channel is
   establishment over Diffie-Hellmann-key exchange between two
   communicating entities. The communication setup is considered as
   robust against DOS, due to a riddle solved at the requestor side. On
   the other side a high overheaed for the secure communication
   establishment due to key exchange has to be taken into
   consideration.

3.4 Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP)
   https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6830 network-layer-based protocol that
   enables separation of IP addresses into two new numbering spaces:
   Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) and Routing Locators (RLOCs) tunnel
   router encapsulates and decapsulates packets

3.5 ILNP

3.6 Identifier-Locator Addressing (ILA) * reduced header size * MN -
   Network Virtualization Edge * NVE creates and maintains local state
   about each Virtual Network for which it is providing service on
   behalf of a Tenant System.


3.7 Comparison of ILA to alternative approaches

   This section compares the ILA approach to some alternatives that have
   been discussed in 5gangip list.

3.7.1 ILNP

   Identifier Locator Network Protocol (ILNP [RFCXXXX]) is an
   experimental protocol that splits and IPv6 address into a locator and
   identfier. ILA is fundamentally based on ILNP.

   The key differences between ILA and ILNP are:

      * ILNP requires changes to the transport layer. This limits ILNP
        to be used only on hosts and every transport protocol
        implementation would need to be modified to use ILNP. Presumably
        to overcome the limitation above, some sort of ILNP proxy could
        be defined to perform ILNP in a middlebox.

      * ILA does not require changes to the transport layer.

      * Checksum neutral translation means that transport layer does not
        need to be parsed to perform ILA. This also ensures that
        existing device offloads (like checksum offload) work
        seamlessly.

      * ILNP employs IPv6 extension headers which are mostly considered
        non-deployable. ILA does not use these.

      * Core support for ILA is in upstream Linux, to date there is no
        publically available source code for ILNP.

      * ILNP involves DNS to distribute mapping information, ILA assumes
        mapping information is not part of naming.

INTERNET DRAFT        <draft-mueller-ila-mobility>                      


3.7.2 LISP

   Locator Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP [RFCXXXX) is an IP
   encapsulation protocol where the destination address in the outer IP
   header is a locator and the destination address in the inner header
   is an idnetifier.

   The key differences between ILA and LISP are:

      * ILA is not encpasulation so there is not associate encapsulaiton
        overhead. For instance IPv6/IPv6 in LISP would have 52 bytes of
        overhead whereas ILA translation has zero.

      * LISP may not work with some network device offloads whereas ILA
        works with all stateless offloads (ILA is transparent to the
        network so that it would just see TCP/IP packets for instance).

      * ILA has been accpeted into Linux, LISP has not been accepted.

      * ILA can run either on end hosts (ILA hosts) or in the network
        (ILA routers). In ILA hosts the mapping database is a cache to
        optimize communications.

      * ILA defines locators and identifiers to be 64 bits whereas LISP
        allows them to be full 128 bit address making for for memory
        needed in mapping table.

      * ILA is not encpasulation so there is not associate encapsulaiton
        overhead. For instance IPv6/IPv6 in LISP would have fifty-six
        bytes of overhead whereas ILA translation has zero.

      * The process of ILA translation is much more efficient than
        performing LISP. The translation path is:

        1) Parse IP header and extract the destination address

        2) Lookup destination in a hash table (obviated with cached
           route for ILA hosts)

        3) Write new destination address (16 byte copy)

        4) Forward to new destination (or receive at final destination).

        LISP processing is more involved. To do encapsulation an outer
        IP header, UDP header and LISP header need to be inserted.
        Tunnel fragmentation and MTU need to be considered [RFCXXXX]
        (i.e. increasing the size of a packet may exceed tunnel MTU). At
        the remote tunnel end point, the outer IP header must be

INTERNET DRAFT        <draft-mueller-ila-mobility>                      


        validated and aa lookup done on the destination address to see
        if it is a local address . A lookup must be done on the
        destination UDP port to find that it is a LISP port. If the UDP
        checksum is not zero that must also be validated. The LISP
        header must also be processed. Once the encapsulation is
        verfied, the headers are removed and the inner packet is either
        forwarded or received.

        compare them using the following parameters:

        * multi-homing? * multi-path? * IP-session continuity: all three
        * seamless handover or transparent handover? Attached with same
        or different interface * state - number and positions * overhead
        through tunneling or header extension * client mobility support
        and efficient update of location information in the network *

4 Mobility Management Architectures for 5G Network Using ILA This
        section outlines the architecture supporting ILA in mobile
        networks. The main functional blocks for connectivity, mobility
        support, security and charging are presented. Message flows for
        basic use cases executed by the mobile UE such as attachment,
        data transport with session handover and detachment are
        outlined.

4.1 Address format for ILA mobile

        The address format is derived out of the ILA draft in ([nvo3]).

              /* IPv6 canonical address format */      |            64
        bits             |             64 bits           |      +-------

        The presented architecture is aligned on the 3GPP Evolved Packet
        System ([23.401], [23.402]) following the separation of control
        plane and data plane. Whereas 3GPP EPS addresses mobility
        through Layer 2 tunneling with GTP, this approach provides a
        Layer 3 mobility approach utilizing the ILA concepts for
        mobility.

        TODO: architecture bootstrapping: which entity assigns ILA
        address space for LOC and ID?


4.3  Functional Elements


        * The User Equipment (UE) is the mobile device (cellular or
        laptop) executing services such as apps on the device, binding
        apps to the ID as communication endpoints, handling the bindings
        of all associated LOC/ID's and performing mobility as described
        below. The UE performs security related functions via its
        (Embedded) SIM handing at least one or multiple identifiers
        provisioned by one or multiple network operators. Security
        related functions include authentication of the UE towards the
        network (more specifically the AP) and certificate management
        for establishing secure transport connections. Either the UE
        supports IPv6 or ILA for handling locator and ID bindings and
        updates or the etwork is handling ILA functionality on behalf of
        the UE. Storage and management of multiple locators for multi-
        path and multi-homing is supported by the UE support.


        * The Access Point (AP) is the first point of contact from the
        UE when attaching over radio to the network. Its main purpose is
        routing, gating and forwarding data and control packets. The
        Radio Access Technology (RAT) is independent of the proposed
        concept and therefore out of scope of this document. 3G, 4G, 5G
        or WiFi are applicable RATs. The AP is also capable of caching
        for Content-Centric-Networks (CCN) TODO:LINK like apps, in order
        to store content or host service instances close to the user at
        the edge of the network. Another aspect of the cache is to
        support transparent handovers, during which buffering of packets
        at the target AP is required. Therefore a X2-like connection
        between APs is required. The AP supports a support a policy
        enforcement function (PEF) as well as a Event Reporting Function
        (ERF) aligned on the 3GPP defined Policy Control and Charging
        (PCC) functionality for the EPS in ([23.203], [29.212]). Uplink
        QoS management is handled by the AP, too. In order to
        differentiate between multiple types of data traffic, signaling,
        high-priority, real-time and non-real-time connections can be

INTERNET DRAFT        <draft-mueller-ila-mobility>                      


        distinguished and the order of packet processing in the AP can
        be influenced for uplink. The same concept applies for downlink
        in the GW. Forward Error Correction (FEC), IP header
        compression, encryption of user data stream are supported by the
        AP, too.

        * The Gateway (GW) encompasses management and policy enforcement
        functions as well. Its main purpose is routing, gating and
        forwarding data and control packets. Therefore functionalities
        such as downlink QoS enforcement, APN management and charging is
        performed by each GW.


        * The Mobility Management Entity (MME) handles the initial
        authentication, authorization and mobility management of UE's
        over the control plane. The MME is responsible for tracking the
        UE's mobility and is in charge for updating the registries with
        near real-time status updates for LOC/ID mapping. ID and LOC
        assignment are performed by the MME.



        * The Home Subscriber Server (HSS) stores and manages user
        profile information. These include the static information such
        as the assigned ID, security credentials as well as dynamic
        information LOC and the current Tracking Area.


        * The Policy Charging Rules Function (PCRF) controls data flows
        in the network architecture according to pre-defined rules. Such
        rules can be created by the network operator such as an upper
        limited for the data rate or total bytes transferred given a
        time interval (e.g. 2GB per month data plane with unlimited
        speed and a reduction of bandwidth after reaching the limit of
        2G). Other rules differentiate between class of services for
        various traffic flow types identified on their Traffic Flow
        Template (TFT) characteristics such as source, destination, port
        and protocol information. The PCRF is handling charging for
        traffic flows using online (pre-paid) and offline (post-paid)
        charging. Both charging modes include a charging based on
        metrics such as service invocations, online time, data
        transferred, or no-charging. Out of credit events may influence
        the current connectivity for online charging, whereas offline
        charging is accumulating charging records which are usually
        processed in a monthly period.


        * The Access Network Discovery and Selection Function (ANDSF) is

        a database used for mapping the user location with available
        access networks. With this information, the ANDSF is capable of
        signaling suggestions for handovers to UE's. A UE is therefore
        able to operate only on one interface at a time to save
        resources. In case of the availability of adjacent RAT and after
        reception of a handover suggestion from the ANDSF, the UE is
        able to enable the suggested interface, perform a scan and
        finally decide whether or not to attach to the new targeted RAT.
        The database can be filled using device monitoring/telemetry
        statistics signaled from the UE to the network or by active
        measurements of the environment.

        traversing the GW.


4.4  Signaling and data flow

4.5.1 Provisioning A Subscriber Identity Module (SIM)-card is
        provisioned by the network operator with a unique ID, that is
        comparable to the IMSI in 3GPP telco architectures (2G, 3G and
        4G). This draft is no differentiating between a physical or an
        embedded SIM. The ID unambiguous identifies the UE within the
        global network, is used for identification, authentication,
        authorization and charging purposes. In addition, security
        credentials and preferred network identifier are provisioned for
        authentication as well as network selection are provisioned. The
        matching information to the SIM card is stored in the HSS. 


4.5.2 Attachment After powering on the device, a scan for available
        networks is performed on the device, which selects the network
        with the strongest signal and performs a network attachment
        procedure aligned with ([23.401], [23.401]) towards the Access
        Point (AP) using security parameters, ID, last MME associated
        with (GUMMEI) and last GUTI assigned by MME with ID GUMMEI - the
        Packet Temporary International Mobile Subscriber Identity (M-
        TSMI).

        For each network attachment and due to privacy concerns for not
        revealing the identify of the UE towards the public, a creation
        of a Globally Unique Temporary UE Identity (GUTI) is performed.

        The AP derives the last MME association out of the network
        attachment request sent by the UE and queries the last or a new

INTERNET DRAFT        <draft-mueller-ila-mobility>                      


        MME based on availability of information for UE authentication.
        The MME performs a lookup in the user database of the network
        operator, which is the Home Subscriber Server (HSS) and/or Home
        Location Register (HLR) and receives a profile in return.

        In the following, the MME selects and configures the AP and GW
        according to the profile received and signals the profile
        including the GUTI towards the AP and GW.

        The AP allocates a LOC for the UE, binds the GUTI-LOC
        combination locally in a cache, publishes its binding in the MME
        and signals the GUTI-LOC towards the client.

        Quality of Service (QoS) and charging related policies are
        installed in the AP and GW. The AP handled uplink and the GW
        downlink related traffic shaping functions. Charging can be
        performed in both functional elements (AP or GW), whereas a
        centralized charging in case of multi-path streaming is
        preferred.


4.5.3 Communication scenarios for data transport for an End-to-End
        session After the successful attachment, a service can be
        invoked. There are three main data path to be considered, to
        address all use cases. The use cases can be distinguished
        between a UE accessing a service in the AF. A UE is
        communicating with another UE. The example use cases below
        outline the details and point out the differences compared to
        today's networks. 

        TODO: Include schema as in nvo3 - 5.3 Reference network for
        scenarios



        1) UE to AF through the complete network

        Considering a communication scenario in which a UE queries a
        website ("http://about.att.com/innovation/foundry") in a
        browser. An ID is retrieved in return from the DNS.

        UE[Task UE_T1] -> DNS // request ID for URL DNS -> UE[Task
        UE_T1] // ID for URI

        The sequence for traversing the network looks as follows.

        UE(GUTI/LOC):[Task UE_T1] <-> AP <-> GW <-> AF[Task AF_T1]

INTERNET DRAFT        <draft-mueller-ila-mobility>                      


        The request is forwards to the AP, which performs ILA router
        functionality and a lookup in a local lookup table. Depending on
        finding an entry in the local lookup table, the routing is
        influenced and the packet is redirected. Otherwise routing on
        the initial destination LOC/ID is fulfilled.


        2) UE_1 to UE_2 attached to distinct APs

        UE1[Task UE1_T1] <-> AP_1 <-> GW <-> AP_2 <-> UE2[Task UE2_T1] 

        Considering a communication scenario in which one mobile device
        (UE1) is contacting a second mobile device (UE2). ILA routing is
        done in the AP. TODO: Classic signaling and data flow similar to
        legacy networks.


        3) UE_1 to UE_2 attached to the same AP 

        UE_1[Task UE1_Tx] <-> AP <-> UE_2[Task UE2_Ty]

        Considering a communication scenario in which two communicating
        entities are attached to the same AP and therefore are in close
        proximity. The solution for routing traffic in todays network is
        the establishment of the datapath from the UE over the access
        network (e.g. eNB) into the core network (e.g. EPC) and back to
        the access network and finally to the UE. Charging needs to be
        performed in the AP for this data flow. This communication
        pattern creates a delay caused by the bearer concept of 3GPP
        network, which encapsulate and de-apsulate data in Layer 2
        tunnels between the eNB and the PGW.


        4) UE to Mobile Edge Cloud (MEC) UE[Task UE_T1] <-> DNS
        Considering a communication scenario in which a Virtual Reality
        (VR) application on a smartphone is accessing a low-delay
        service in the network e.g. an image recognition service. In
        order to provide a high quality of experience for the user, the
        delay between the mobile device and the service should be
        reduced.

        Firstly, a DNS lookup resolves the URL into a ID to identify the
        closest service instance. The lookup process may be resolve to a
        service co-located at the AP or trigger the deployment of that
        service instance within a datacenter co-located or attached to
        the AP. 

        A request is created and addressed with the source LOC/ID and

        targeted towards the destination LOC/ID.

        The sequence for traversing the network looks as follows.

        UE[Task UE_T1] <-> AP <-> AF[Task AF_T1]

        5) Summarizing, the use of ILA for mobile reduces allows
        multiple improvements compared to legacy telecommunication
        networks. Firstly, the improved datapath has less hops to
        traverse between UE and AF or UE_1 and UE_2 due to the flatter
        architecture. Secondly, the less overhead is created due to the
        reduction of GTP tunnels between network elements. Thirdly, the
        more efficient routing reduces the core network traffic by
        routing traffic particularly locally and avoiding re-routing and
        traffic forwarding through the complete core network, even in
        scenarios, in which the communication partner are in close
        proximity and attached to the same AP. lower delay, which is one
        critical requirement for 5G networks.


4.5.4 Homogeneous Handover Client mobility using the same access network
        technology due to location changes is referred to as homogeneous
        handover. Triggers for homogeneous handover may be changes in
        signal strength at the UE or network based handover due to
        network policies such as load balancing.

        The status information (the list of signals received from
        adjacent APs including their signal strength) signaled from the
        UE towards the AP indicates its position via triangulation as
        well as the alternative AP's to which the UE may connect to.

        Reasons for handovers may be evacuation/preemption of resources
        on the AP due to emergency scenarios or higher priority calls,
        UE/AP/service load balancing or physical mobility of the UE
        among the network. The current resource utilization (e.g. data
        rates) of the UE or historical traffic pattern may influence the
        handover and the AP selection process.

        The MME selects a new AP (AP_new) as target for the handover of
        the UE away from the current AP (AP_current). The decision is
        signaled to related AP's and the UE. AP_current starts de-
        allocating resource blocked by the UE and AP_new blocks
        resources required by the UE. Since most UE's are considered to
        have only a single RAT of each type (one WLAN or one LTE
        interface) an interruption in the connection while handover is
        to be expected. In order to avoid packet loss at the UE,
        buffering at the AP_new as well as packet forwarding from
        AP_current to AP_new are supported. Only after UE successfully

INTERNET DRAFT        <draft-mueller-ila-mobility>                      


        establishes connectivity at the AP_new, previously blocked
        resources at AP_current are freed up, which are used as handover
        role-back in case of failure. Finally the MME announces the new
        LOC(AP_new)/ID for the UE as an update at GW and in the DNS.

        New incoming connections are forwards directly towards the UE
        over AP_new using the proclaimed LOC/ID.


4.5.5 Heterogeneous Handover Client mobility may involve various Radio
        Access Technologies (RAT), in which the client is handed off
        from RAT_1 to RAT_2. The client is not required to move
        physically for heterogeneous mobility. Instead measurements on
        the UE or suggestion from the network over the ANDSF may trigger
        handovers even when the UE is physically not moving.

        Heterogeneous handover may be motivated for optimizing
        connectivity between UE and a service to move a multimedia
        connection with high bandwidth requirements from cellular
        towards WLAN or a security sensitive bank transaction from WLAN
        towards cellular.

        Heterogeneous (compared to homogenous) handovers may be
        performed seamless with establishing a second alternative
        connection in parallel to the existing and tearing down the old
        connection, after successfully establishing the new connection.
        In order to provide higher bandwidth over multi-path, both
        connections may be kept open in parallel. In this regard, the
        MME adds another LOC'/ID as update to the existing entry LOC/ID
        in the registry on the gateways and DNS.


4.5.6 Detachment A detachment from the network can happen gracefully by
        shutting down the phone and de-registering it from the AP or
        suddenly due to a loss of connection. In both situations, a de-
        registration from the UE out of the list of active users
        attached to the AP is done directly or indirectly (after
        inactivity for a predefined timeframe). Resource reservations
        are freed up again after detachment.
