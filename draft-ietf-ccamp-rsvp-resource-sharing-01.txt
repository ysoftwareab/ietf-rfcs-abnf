        RSVP Resource Sharing Remote Identification Association
             draft-ietf-ccamp-rsvp-resource-sharing-01.txt

Abstract

   The Resource reSerVation Protocol (RSVP) ASSOCIATION object allows to
   create association across RSVP path states or across Resv states.
   Two association types are currently defined: recovery and resource
   sharing.  This document defines a new association type called
   "Resource Sharing Remote Identification".  It can be used by the
   sender to convey to the receiver the information that can then be
   used by the receiver to identify a downstream initiated resource
   sharing association.

1.  Introduction

   The notion of association as well as the corresponding RSVP
   ASSOCIATION object are defined in [RFC4872] and [RFC4873] in the
   context of GMPLS (Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching)
   controlled label switched paths (LSPs).  In this context, the object
   is used to associate recovery LSPs with the LSP they are protecting.
   This object also has broader applicability as a mechanism to
   associate RSVP state, and [I-D.ietf-ccamp-assoc-info] defines how the
   ASSOCIATION object can be more generally applied.
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-assoc-info] also reviews how the association is to be
   provided in the context of GMPLS recovery.

   [RFC4872] defines the IPv4 ASSOCIATION object and the IPv6
   ASSOCIATION object.  In addition, [I-D.ietf-ccamp-assoc-info] defines
   the Extended IPv4 ASSOCIATION object and the Extended IPv6
   ASSOCIATION object.  These four forms of the ASSOCIATION object
   contain an Association Type field that indicates the type of
   association being identified by the ASSOCIATION object.  For example,
   Figure 1 illustrates the format of the IPv4 ASSOCIATION object.

   [RFC4872] and [RFC4873] define two association types: recovery and
   resource sharing.  Recovery type association is only applicable
   within the context of recovery ( [RFC4872] and [RFC4873]).  Resource
   sharing is useful in multiple contexts and its general use is defined
   in section 4.3.1 of [I-D.ietf-ccamp-assoc-info].  For non-recovery
   usage (for example for resource sharing), [I-D.ietf-ccamp-assoc-info]
   defines, in section 4, the notion of upstream initiated association
   and downstream initiated association.  Upstream initiated association
   is represented in ASSOCIATION objects carried in Path messages and
   can be used to associate RSVP Path state across MPLS Tunnels or RSVP
   sessions.  Downstream initiated association is represented in
   ASSOCIATION objects carried in Resv messages and can be used to
   associate RSVP Resv state across MPLS Tunnels or RSVP sessions.

   This document defines a new association type called "Resource Sharing
   Remote Identification".

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Resource Sharing Remote Identification Association

   We define here a new association type called the Resource Sharing
   Remote Identification.

   The Resource Sharing Remote Identification association type can be
   used with the IPv4 ASSOCIATION object and the IPv6 ASSOCIATION object
   defined in [RFC4872] as well as with the Extended IPv4 ASSOCIATION
   object and the Extended IPv6 ASSOCIATION object defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-assoc-info].

   The Resource Sharing Remote Identification association is only
   defined for use in upstream initiated association.  Thus it can only
   appear in ASSOCIATION objects signaled in Path messages.

   The Resource Sharing Remote Identification association can be used by
   the sender to convey to the receiver (inside the Association Source
   and Association ID fields), information that can then be used by the
   receiver to identify an upstream initiated resource sharing
   association.  This is useful in upstream initiated resource sharing
   applications where the identification of the resource sharing
   association is not known a priori by the receiver, and instead is
   known by the sender (for example because the sender is in a better
   position to assign the association identification necessary to
   implement the desired resource sharing across RSVP sessions).

   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-assoc-info] discusses the rules associated with the
   processing of ASSOCIATION objects in RSVP messages.  In addition to
   generic rules applicable to all association types, a given
   association type may define type-specific processing rules.  The
   following type-specific association rule is defined for the Resource
   Sharing Remote Identification association type:

   o  The Resource Sharing Remote Identification association does not
      create any association across Path states.

   This is because the purpose of signaling an Resource Sharing Remote
   Identification association in the downstream direction is purely to
   convey identification information from the sender to the receiver
   that can be used by the receiver to establish an upstream initiated
   resource sharing association.

   Any implementation of the present specification MUST support the
   Resource Sharing Remote Identification association.

   On receipt of an ASSOCIATION object whose association type is
   Resource Sharing Remote Identification, the receiver MAY use the
   association identification information contained in the received

Internet-Draft         Resource Sharing Remote Id             March 2011


   ASSOCIATION object as the association identification information in
   an upstream initiated resource sharing association.

   On receipt of an ASSOCIATION object whose association type is
   Resource Sharing Remote Identification, an RSVP receiver proxy as
   defined in [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-rsvp-proxy-approaches], SHOULD initiate an
   upstream initiated Resource Sharing association whose association
   identification information is copied from the received ASSOCIATION
   object.  This behavior MAY be overridden by local policy on the
   receiver proxy.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to administer assignment of new values for
   namespaces in accordance with codepoints defined in this document and
   summarized in this section.

4.1.  Resource Sharing Remote Identification Association Type

   This document defines, in Section 2, a new association type.  Thus,
   IANA is requested to allocate the following entry in the Association
   Type registry found at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/gmpls-sig-parameters/ :

      3 Resource Sharing Remote Identification (I) [this-document]

   There are no other IANA considerations introduced by this document.
