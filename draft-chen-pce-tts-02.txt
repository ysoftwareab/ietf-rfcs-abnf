                  Extensions to PCEP for Temporal LSP
                       draft-chen-pce-tts-02.txt

Abstract

   For existing MPLS LSP tunnel services, it is hard for LSP tunnels to
   be booked in advance.  In addition, once an LSP tunnel is set up, it
   is assumed to consume a certain amount of resources such as link
   bandwidth forever.

   Temporal LSP tunnel services (TTS) provides an easy way for us to
   book temporal LSP tunnels in advance.  More importantly, a temporal
   LSP is an LSP with one or more time intervals and it is assumed to
   consume the resources and carry traffic only in these time intervals.

   This document specifies extensions to PCEP for computing a path for a
   temporal LSP, initiating and maintaining a temporal LSP with a
   sequence of time intervals, during each of which the LSP carries
   traffic.

1.  Introduction

   Once an existing multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) traffic
   engineering (TE) label switched path (LSP) is set up, it is assumed
   to carry traffic forever until it is down.  When an MPLS TE LSP
   tunnel is up, it is assumed that the LSP consumes its reserved
   network resources forever even though the LSP may only use network
   resources during some period of time.  As a result, the network
   resources are not used efficiently.  Moreover, a tunnel service can
   not be reserved or booked in advance for a period of time or a
   sequence of time periods.

   Temporal LSP tunnel services (TTS) provides an easy way for us to
   book temporal LSP tunnels in advance.  More importantly, a temporal
   LSP is an LSP with one or more time intervals and it is assumed to
   consume the resources and carry traffic only in each of these time
   intervals.

   This document specifies extensions to PCEP for computing a path for a
   temporal LSP, initiating and maintaining a temporal LSP with a period
   of time called a time interval or a sequence of time intervals.  It
   is assumed that the LSP carries traffic during this time interval or
   each of these time intervals.  Thus the network resources are
   efficiently used.  More importantly, some new services can be
   provided.  For example, a consumer can book a tunnel service in
   advance for a given time interval or a sequence of time intervals.
   Tunnel services may be scheduled.

4.  Operations Overview

   This section briefly describes some operations on a temporal LSP.

4.1.  Simple Time Interval

   For a temporal LSP, a user configures it with a time interval or a
   sequence of time intervals.  A simple time interval is a time period
   from time Ta to time Tb, which may be represented as [Ta, Tb].

   When an LSP is configured with time interval [Ta, Tb], a path
   satisfying the constraints for the LSP in the time interval is
   computed and the LSP along the path is set up to carry traffic from
   time Ta to time Tb.

   In addition to simple time intervals, there are recurrent time
   intervals and elastic time intervals.  Sometimes a simple time
   interval is called a time interval.

4.2.  Recurrent Time Interval

   A recurrent time interval represents a series of repeated simple time
   intervals.  It has a simple time interval such as [Ta, Tb], a number
   of repeats such as 10 (repeats 10 times), and a repeat cycle/time
   such as a week (repeats every week).  The recurrent time interval:
   "[Ta, Tb] repeats n times with repeat cycle C" represents n+1 simple
   time intervals as follows:

     [Ta, Tb], [Ta+C, Tb+C], [Ta+2C, Tb+2C], ..., [Ta+nC, Tb+nC]


   When an LSP is configured with a recurrent time interval such as
   "[Ta, Tb] repeats 10 times with a repeat cycle a week" (representing
   11 simple time intervals), a path satisfying the constraints for the
   LSP in each of the simple time intervals represented by the recurrent
   time interval is computed and the LSP along the path is set up to

Internet-Draft              PCE Temporal LSP                October 2015


   carry traffic in each of the simple time intervals.

4.3.  Elastic Time Interval

   An elastic time interval is a time interval with an elastic range,
   which is represented as within -P and Q, where P and Q is an amount
   of time such as 300 seconds.  P is called elastic range lower bound
   and Q is called elastic range upper bound.

   For a simple time interval such as [Ta, Tb] with an elastic range,
   elastic time interval: "[Ta, Tb] within -P and Q" means a time period
   from (Ta+X) to (Tb+X), where -P <= X <= Q. Note that both Ta and Tb
   may be shifted the same X.

   When an LSP is configured with elastic time interval "[Ta, Tb] within
   -P and Q", a path is computed such that the path satisfies the
   constraints for the LSP in the time period from (Ta+X) to (Tb+X) and
   |X| is the minimum value from 0 to max(P, Q).  That is that [Ta+X,
   Tb+X] is the time interval closest to time interval [Ta, Tb] within
   the elastic range.  The LSP along the path is set up to carry traffic
   in the time period from (Ta+X) to (Tb+X).

   Similarly, for a recurrent time interval with an elastic range,
   elastic time interval: "[Ta, Tb] repeats n times with repeat cycle C
   within -P and Q" represents n+1 simple elastic time intervals as
   follows:

     [Ta+X0, Tb+X0], [Ta+C+X1, Tb+C+X1], ..., [Ta+nC+Xn, Tb+nC+Xn]


   where -P <= Xi <= Q, i = 0, 1, 2, ..., n.

   If a user wants to keep the same repeat cycle between any two
   adjacent time intervals, elastic time interval: "[Ta, Tb] repeats n
   times with repeat cycle C within -P and Q SYNC" may be used, which
   represents n+1 simple elastic time intervals as follows:

     [Ta+X, Tb+X], [Ta+C+X, Tb+C+X], ..., [Ta+nC+X, Tb+nC+X]


   where -P <= X <= Q.

4.4.  Changes to Time Interval

   After a temporal LSP is configured, a user may change its parameters
   including some of the time intervals configured.  A new time interval
   may be added, an existing time interval may be removed or changed.

Internet-Draft              PCE Temporal LSP                October 2015


   When a new time interval is added to an existing LSP, a path
   satisfying the constraints for the LSP in the time interval is
   computed and the LSP along the path is set up to carry traffic in the
   time interval.

   When an existing time interval is removed from an existing LSP, the
   time interval is deleted from the lifetime of the LSP.  If the
   lifetime is over, the LSP is deleted.

   A change to an existing time interval may generate some of four
   possible results:

   1.  The existing time interval is extended for a time period EA after
       the existing time period;

   2.  The existing time interval is extended for a time period EB
       before the existing time period;

   3.  The existing time interval is shrunk for a time period SA from
       the end of the existing time period; and

   4.  The existing time interval is shrunk for a time period SB from
       the beginning of the existing time period.

   When an existing time interval for an LSP is extended, a path
   satisfying the constraints for the LSP in the extended time interval
   is computed and the LSP along the path is set up to carry traffic in
   the extended time interval.  If the LSP is already up to carry
   traffic in the existing time interval, the lifetime of the LSP is
   extended for time period EA following the existing time interval.

   When an existing time interval for an LSP is shrunk, the shrunk time
   periods are removed from the lifetime of the LSP.

4.5.  Graceful Periods

   For a temporal LSP, a user may want to have some graceful periods for
   each or some of the time intervals for the LSP.  Two graceful periods
   may be configured for a time interval.  One is the graceful period
   before the time interval, called grace-before, which extends the
   lifetime of the LSP for grace-before (such as 30 seconds) before the
   time interval.  The other is the one after the time interval, called
   grace-after, which extends the lifetime of the LSP for grace-after
   (such as 60 seconds) after the time interval.

   When an LSP is configured with a simple time interval such as [Ta,
   Tb] with graceful periods such as grace-before GB and grace-after GA,
   a path is computed such that the path satisfies the constraints for

   the LSP in the time period from Ta to Tb.  The LSP along the path is
   set up to carry traffic in the time period from (Ta-GB) to (Tb+GA).
   During graceful periods from (Ta-GB) to Ta and from Tb to (Tb+GA),
   the LSP is up to carry traffic (maybe in best effort).


5.  Extensions to PCEP

   This section describes the extensions to PCEP for computing paths for
   temporal LSP, initiating and maintaining temporal LSPs.

5.1.  Capability TLV in Existing PCE Discovery Protocol

   There are a couple of options for advertising a PCE capability for
   computing paths for temporal LSP, initiating and maintaining temporal
   LSPs.

   The first option is to define a new flag in the OSPF and ISIS PCE
   Capability Flags to indicate the capability that a PCE is capable to
   compute paths for temporal LSPs, initiate and maintain temporal LSPs.
   This includes the capability of computing both a path for a temporal
   P2MP LSP and a path for a temporal P2P LSP.

   The second option is to define three new flags.  The first new flag
   in the OSPF and ISIS PCE Capability Flags indicates the capability
   that a PCE is capable to compute a path for a temporal P2MP LSP; the
   second new flag indicates the capability that a PCE is capable to
   compute a path for a temporal P2P LSP; and the third new flag
   indicates the capability that a PCE is capable to initiate and
   maintain a temporal LSP.

   The format of the PCE-CAP-FLAGS sub-TLV is as follows:

         Type:     5
         Length:   Multiple of 4 octets
         Value:    This contains an array of units of 32-bit flags
                   numbered from the most significant as bit zero, where
                   each bit represents one PCE capability.

   The following capability bits have been assigned by IANA:

         Bit       Capabilities
          0        Path computation with GMPLS link constraints
          1        Bidirectional path computation
          2        Diverse path computation
          3        Load-balanced path computation
          4        Synchronized path computation
          5        Support for multiple objective functions
          6        Support for additive path constraints
                   (max hop count, etc.)
          7        Support for request prioritization
          8        Support for multiple requests per message
          9        Global Concurrent Optimization (GCO)
          10       P2MP path computation
          ...


   Reserved bits SHOULD be set to zero on transmission and MUST be
   ignored on receipt.

   For the second option, one bit such as bit 16 may be assigned to
   indicate that a PCE is capable to compute a path for a temporal P2MP
   LSP; another bit such as bit 17 may be assigned to indicate that a
   PCE is capable to compute a path for a temporal P2P LSP; and yet
   another bit such as bit 18 may be assigned to indicate that a PCE is
   capable to initiate and maintain temporal LSPs.

         Bit       Capabilities
          16       Path computation for temporal P2MP LSP
          17       Path computation for temporal P2P LSP
          18       Initiation and maintenance of temporal LSP
         19-31     Reserved for future assignments by IANA.

5.2.  Open Message Extension

   If a PCE does not advertise its capability related to computation of
   paths for a temporal LSP, initiation and maintenance of a temporal
   LSP during discovery, PCEP should be used to allow a PCC to discover,
   during the Open Message Exchange, which PCEs are capable of
   supporting computation of a path for a temporal LSP, initiation and
   maintenance of a temporal LSP.

   To achieve this, we extend the PCEP OPEN object by defining a new
   optional TLV to indicate the PCE's capability to compute paths for a
   temporal LSP, initiate and maintain a temporal LSP.

   We request IANA to allocate a value such as 10 from the "PCEP TLV
   Type Indicators" subregistry, as documented in Section below
   ("Temporal LSP Capability TLV").  The description is "temporal LSP
   capable", and the length value is 2 bytes.  The value field is set to
   indicate the capability of a PCE for computation of paths for a
   temporal LSP, initiation and maintenance of a temporal LSP in
   details.

   We can use flag bits in the value field in the same way as the PCE
   Capability Flags described in the previous section.

   The inclusion of this TLV in an OPEN object indicates that the sender
   can compute paths for a temporal LSP, initiate and maintain a
   temporal LSP.

   The capability TLV is meaningful only for a PCE, so it will typically
   appear only in one of the two Open messages during PCE session
   establishment.  However, in case of PCE cooperation (e.g., inter-
   domain), when a PCE behaving as a PCC initiates a PCE session it
   SHOULD also indicate its capabilities.

5.3.  RP Object Extension

   The following flags are added into the RP Object:

   A T bit is added in the flag bits field of the RP object to tell a
   receiver of a message that the message is for (computing paths for a
   temporal LSP, initiating and maintaining) a temporal LSP.

       o T (Temporal LSP bit - 1 bit):

           0: This indicates that this is not a message
              for a temporal LSP.

           1: This indicates that this is a message

              for a temporal LSP.


   The IANA request is referenced in Section below (Request Parameter
   Bit Flags) of this document.

   This T bit with the N bit defined in RFC6006 can indicate whether the
   message is for a temporal P2P LSP or P2MP LSP.

     o T = 1 and N = 0: This indicates that this is a message
                        for a temporal P2P LSP
     o T = 1 and N = 1: This indicates that this is a message
                        for a temporal P2MP LSP


5.4.  TIME INTERVAL Object

   For a TIME-INTERVAL object, its Class is to be assigned by IANA, here
   we use 18, which may be changed late.  Its OT is 1, exact number to
   be assigned by IANA.  The format of a TIME-INTERVAL object body is
   illustrated below, which comprises a number of time interval TLVs.

   A time interval TLV may be a relative time interval TLV or an
   absolute time interval TLV, which are two different representations
   of a time interval.  Their advantages and disadvantages are discussed
   below.

5.4.1.  Absolute Time Interval TLV

   The format of an absolute time interval TLV (Type = 1) for an LSP is
   illustrated below.  It mainly contains a Start-time and an End-time,
   representing time interval [Start-time, End-time].  Both of these two
   times are the times that are synchronized among all the elements
   involved.  Thus the clocks on all the elements MUST be synchronized
   if an absolute time interval TLV is used.  The time period
   represented in an absolute time interval TLV is more accurate.

   In addition, it contains an non zero grace-before and grace-after if

   graceful periods are configured.  It includes an non zero elastic
   range lower bound and upper bound if there is an elastic range
   configured.

    o Start-time:   The time LSP starts to carry traffic.

    o End-time:   The time LSP stops carrying traffic.

    o GrB (Grace-Before):   The graceful period time length in seconds
      before time interval [Start-time, End-time].

    o GrA (Grace-After):   The graceful period time length in seconds
      after time interval [Start-time, End-time].

    o Elastic-Lower-Bound:   The maximum amount of time in seconds that
      time interval [Start-time, End-time] can shift to lower/left.

    o Elastic-Upper-Bound:   The maximum amount of time in seconds that
      time interval [Start-time, End-time] can shift to upper/right.

   Discussions: Optionally, we may define three TLVs below:

   1.  an absolute time interval TLV containing only a Start-time and an
       End-time;

   2.  an elastic range TLV containing just an elastic range lower bound
       and upper bound; and

   3.  a graceful period TLV containing only a grace-before and a grace-
       after.

   If a time interval is with an elastic range, an absolute time
   interval TLV followed by an elastic range TLV is used.  If a time

   interval is with graceful periods, an absolute time interval TLV
   followed by a graceful period TLV is used.

5.4.2.  Relative Time Interval TLV

   The format of a relative time interval TLV (Type = 2) for an LSP is
   shown below.  It mainly contains a Start-time-length and an End-time-
   length, representing the time interval below for the LSP:

    [current-time + Start-time-length, current-time + End-time-length]


   where current-time is a current local time.  When a time interval
   from time Ta to time Tb is configured on a node/element, these two
   time lengths are the time lengths that are computed on the node using
   a current local time as follows.

     Start-time-length = Ta - current-time;
     End-time-length   = Tb - current-time;


   For a relative time interval TLV, the clocks/times on all the
   elements involved can be different.  But the time period represented
   in a relative time interval TLV on one element/node may be shifted a
   little bit from another element's point of view since transmitting
   the TLV from one element to another takes a little time, which is
   hard to be considered accurately.

   The TLV also includes an non zero grace-before and grace-after if
   graceful periods are configured.  It contains an non zero elastic
   range lower bound and upper bound if there is an elastic range
   configured.

    o Start-time-length:   The time length in seconds from a current
      local time to the time LSP starts to carry traffic.

    o End-time-length:   The time length in seconds from a current local
      time to the time LSP ends carrying traffic.

    o GrB (Grace-Before):   The graceful period time length in seconds
      before the time interval above for the LSP.

    o GrA (Grace-After):   The graceful period time length in seconds
      after the time interval above for the LSP.

    o Elastic-Lower-Bound:   The maximum amount of time in seconds that
      the time interval above for the LSP can shift to lower/left.

    o Elastic-Upper-Bound:   The maximum amount of time in seconds that
      the time interval above can shift to upper/right.

5.4.3.  Recurrent Absolute Time Interval TLV

   The format of a recurrent absolute time interval TLV (Type = 3) for
   an LSP is illustrated below.  It mainly contains a Start-time, an
   End-time, a Repeat-time-length, a Options field and a Number-repeats.

   The Start-time and End-time represents time interval [Start-time,
   End-time].  The Repeat-time-length represents a repeat cycle/time,
   which is valid if the Options field is set to indicate the way to
   repeat is "repeat every Repeat-time-length".  The Options field
   indicates a way to repeat.  The Number-repeats indicates the number
   of repeats of time interval [Start-time, End-time].

   In addition, the TLV includes an non zero grace-before and grace-
   after if graceful periods are configured.  It contains an non zero
   elastic range lower bound and upper bound if there is an elastic
   range configured.

   an LSP is shown below.  It mainly contains a Start-time-length, an
   End-time-length, a Repeat-time-length, a Options field and a Number-
   repeats.

   The Start-time-length and End-time-length represents time interval

     [current-time + Start-time-length, current-time + End-time-length]


   where current-time is a current local time.  The Repeat-time-length

5.5.  Messages for Temporal LSP

   This section presents and discusses two classes of messages.  One
   class is the messages between a PCE and a PCC on the ingress of a
   temporal LSP for initiating and maintaining the LSP.  The other is
   the messages between two PCEs, one of which acts as a PCC.

Internet-Draft              PCE Temporal LSP                October 2015


5.5.1.  Messages between PCE and PCC on Ingress

   From function's point of view, there are four groups of messages:

   1.  LSP creation request messages,

   2.  LSP deletion request messages,

   3.  LSP creation response messages, and

   4.  LSP deletion response messages.

   A message for an LSP in the first two groups is sent from a PCE to
   the PCC on the ingress of the LSP.  A message for an LSP in the last
   two groups is sent from the PCC on the ingress of the LSP to a PCE.

   A Path Computation LSP Initiate Request (PCInitiate) message with
   some extensions can be used for a message in the first two groups.  A
   Path Computation LSP State Report (PCRpt) message with some
   extensions can be used for a message in the last two groups.

   For an LSP creation request, a PCInitiate message includes objects:
   SRP, LSP, END-POINTS, ERO and TIME-INTERVAL.  SRP (Stateful PCE
   Request Parameters) object comprises an SRP-ID-number.  LSP object
   comprises PLSP-ID of 0, and SYMBOLIC-PATH-NAME TLV with path name.
   END-POINTS object comprises the source and destination addresses of
   the LSP.  ERO object comprise the path (i.e., ERO) for the LSP.
   TIME-INTERVAL object comprises the time intervals for the LSP (the
   path satisfies constraints for the LSP in each of the time
   intervals).

   For an LSP creation response, a PCRpt message includes objects: SRP,
   LSP, ERO and TIME-INTERVAL.  SRP object comprises the SRP-ID-number
   in the corresponding LSP creation request message.  LSP object
   comprises a PLSP-ID assigned to the LSP by the PCC, SYMBOLIC-PATH-
   NAME TLV with path name, C Flag set to 1 indicates that this LSP is
   created by the LSP creation request.  ERO object comprise the path
   (i.e., ERO) for the LSP.  TIME-INTERVAL object comprises the time
   intervals for the LSP.

   For an LSP deletion request, a PCInitiate message includes objects:
   SRP, LSP, and TIME-INTERVAL.  SRP object comprises an SRP-ID-number
   and R (remove) flag set to 1.  LSP object comprises the PLSP-ID for
   the LSP created.  TIME-INTERVAL object comprises the time intervals
   for the LSP.

   For an LSP deletion response, a PCRpt message includes objects: SRP,
   LSP, and TIME-INTERVAL.  SRP object comprises the SRP-ID-number in

   the corresponding LSP deletion request message.  LSP object comprises
   R(Remove) flag set to 1 indicating that the LSP has been removed from
   the PCC, and LSP Identifiers TLV.

   Note: The PCC on the ingress of an LSP does not use any time
   intervals in the TIME-INTERVAL object received for signaling the LSP.
   For just creating and deleting LSPs, we do not need to include any
   TIME-INTERVAL object in a message if the PCE creates the LSP with a
   sequence of time intervals at the beginning of each of the time
   intervals and deletes the LSP at the end of each of the time
   intervals.

   Discussions: For an LSP having a time interval TLV with graceful
   periods, we may create the LSP in the time period including the
   graceful periods and the LSP has the reserved bandwidth during that
   period (including the graceful periods).

   Another option is that we create the LSP in the time period including
   the graceful periods, but do not reserve any bandwidth for the LSP in
   the beginning.  The desired bandwidth for the LSP is reserved in the
   time period without graceful periods.

   After the graceful period before the time interval, the bandwidth for
   the LSP is reserved through a update message from the PCE to the PCC
   on the ingress of the LSP.  After the time interval (i.e., just
   before the graceful period after the time interval), the bandwidth
   for the LSP is released through another update message from the PCE
   to the PCC on the ingress of the LSP.

5.5.2.  Messages between two PCEs

   Figure below illustrates the format of a request message with a
   optional TIME-INTERVAL object for computing paths for a temporal LSP
   with a sequence of time intervals:

           <PCReq Message>::= <Common Header>
                              [<svec-list>]

6.  Procedures

   This section focuses on the procedures for creating and deleting a
   temporal LSP.  When a PCE receives a request for an LSP with a
   sequence of time intervals from a user or application, it computes a
   path satisfying the constraints for the LSP in each of the time
   intervals and reserved the bandwidth for the LSP along the path in
   each of the time intervals.  And then it initiates the creation of
   the LSP in the network to carry traffic in each of the time
   intervals.

   There are a couple of ways for a PCE to create an LSP with a sequence
   of time intervals.  One way is that the PCE initiates the creation of
   the LSP at the beginning of each of the time intervals.  At the end
   of each of the time intervals or when a deletion request for the LSP
   received, the PCE initiates the deletion of the LSP.

   Another way is that the PCE initiates the creation of the LSP at or
   before the beginning of the first time interval and the deletion of
   the LSP at the end of the last time interval.  At the start of each
   time interval, the PCE initiates the update of the LSP with the
   reserved resource such as link bandwidth.  At the end of the each
   time interval, the PCE initiates the update of the LSP with zero
   resource.

   We will focus on the first way below.

6.1.  Creating a Temporal LSP

   A procedure for creating a temporal LSP is as follows:

Internet-Draft              PCE Temporal LSP                October 2015


    Step 1:   A PCE receives a request for creating a temporal LSP from
      a user or application.

    Step 2:   The PCE computes a shortest path satisfying constraints
      for the LSP in each of the time intervals given.  It reserves the
      bandwidth in TED on each of the links the LSP traverses for each
      of the time intervals and stores the information about the LSP
      into an LSP database.

    Step 3:   At the beginning of each of the time intervals, the PCE
      initiates the setup of the LSP in a network through sending an LSP
      creation request (e.g., a PCInitiate with LSP object with PLSP-
      ID=0) with the path for the LSP to the PCC on the ingress of the
      LSP, which triggers RSVP-TE to signal the LSP along the path in
      the network (Note that the RSVP-TE is not aware of any time
      interval for the LSP and just sets up the LSP in a normal way).
      The PCC sends an LSP creation response (e.g., a PCRpt) to the PCE
      after the LSP is up.

    Step 4:   The PCE receives the LSP creation response (e.g., the
      PCRpt) from the PCC corresponding to the request and updates the
      status of the LSP accordingly.

6.2.  Deleting a Temporal LSP

   Suppose that a temporal LSP has been created to carry traffic in a
   sequence of time intervals.  A procedure for deleting this temporal
   LSP is as follows:

    Step 1:   A PCE receives a request for deleting the temporal LSP
      from an client, or the lifetime for the LSP in a time interval is
      over and the LSP needs to be deleted.

    Step 2:   The PCE finds the LSP in the LSP database and gets the
      information about the LSP.

    Step 3:   The PCE initiates the deletion of the LSP in the network
      through sending an LSP deletion request (e.g., a PCInitiate with R
      flag set and PLSP ID for the LSP) to the PCC on the ingress of the
      LSP, which triggers the RSVP-TE to tear down the LSP in the
      network (Note that the RSVP-TE is not aware of any time interval
      for the LSP and just tears down the LSP in a normal way).  The PCC
      generates an LSP deletion response (e.g., a PCRpt with R flag set)
      and sends it to the PCE after the LSP is torn down.

Internet-Draft              PCE Temporal LSP                October 2015


    Step 4:   The PCE receives the LSP deletion response (e.g., the
      PCRpt) from the PCC corresponding to the request and updates the
      status of the LSP accordingly.  For deleting the LSP completely as
      requested, it releases the bandwidth reserved for the LSP in TED
      for each of the time intervals and removes the information about
      the LSP from the LSP database after the LSP is deleted.


7.  Considerations on TED

   The existing Traffic Engineering (TE) information in a TEDB
   represents an unreserved bandwidth Bi at each of eight priority
   levels for a link at one point of time, for example, at the current
   time.

     Bandwidth
       ^
       |
     Bi|______________________________________________________
       |
       |
      -+------------------------------------------------------> Time
       |


   This means that the link has bandwidth Bi at a priority level from
   now to forever until there is a change to it.  Thus, a TE Label
   Switching Path (LSP) tunnel for a given time interval cannot be set
   up in advance using the information in the TED and the bandwidth
   cannot be reserved in advance for the LSP in the time interval given.

   TED needs to be enhanced for supporting temporal LSPs.  Two options
   for enhancing TED are presented below.

7.1.  TE Representation in Absolute Time

   Suppose that the amount of the unreserved bandwidth at a priority
   level for a link is Bj in a time interval from time Tj to Tk (k =
   j+1), where j = 0, 1, 2, ....  The unreserved bandwidth for the link
   can be represented as

       [T0, B0], [T1, B1], [T2, B2], [T3, B3], ....


   This is an absolute time representation of bandwidths for a link.
   Time Tj (j = 0, 1, 2, ...)  MUST be a synchronized time among all the
   elements involved.

     Bandwidth
       ^
       |                                    B3
       |          B1                        ___________
       |          __________
       |B0                                             B4
       |__________          B2                         _________
       |                    ________________
       |
      -+-------------------------------------------------------> Time
       |T0        T1        T2              T3         T4


   If an LSP is completely deleted at time T and uses bandwidth B, then
   for every time interval/period (after time T) during which bandwidth
   B is reserved for the LSP on a link, B is added to the link for that
   interval/period.

   If an LSP is to be up at time T and uses bandwidth B, then for every
   time interval/period (after time T) during which bandwidth B is
   reserved for the LSP on a link, B is subtracted from the link for
   that interval/period.

7.2.  TE Representation in Relative Time

   Alternatively, a relative time representation of bandwidths for a
   link can be used.  For example, the amount of the unreserved
   bandwidth at a priority level for a link is Bj during a series of
   time intervals/periods can be expressed as

       [P0, B0], [P1, B1], [P2, B2], [P3, B3], ..., where
       Pj = Tk - Tj, k = (j+1) and j = 0, 1, 2, 3, ....


   In this representation, every time Tj (j = 0, 1, 2, ...) can be a
   local time.  A timer may expire for every unit of time (e.g., every
   second) and may trigger --P0, which decrements P0.  When P0 = 0, P1
   becomes P0, P2 becomes P1, and so on.

   If an LSP is completely deleted at time T and uses bandwidth B, then
   for every time interval/period (after time T) during which bandwidth
   B is reserved for the LSP on a link, B is added to the link for that
   interval/period.

   If an LSP is to be up at time T and uses bandwidth B, then for every
   time interval/period (after time T) during which bandwidth B is
   reserved for the LSP on a link, B is subtracted from the link for
   that interval/period.

   An advantage of using relative time representation is that the times
   or clocks on all the elements involved can be different.
