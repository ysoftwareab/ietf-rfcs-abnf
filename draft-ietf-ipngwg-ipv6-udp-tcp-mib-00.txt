     This document is one in the series of  documents  that  define
     various MIB object groups for IPv6.  Specifically, the UDP and
     TCP groups are defined in this document.

     Internet-Draft   IPv6 MIB: UDP and TCP Groups    February 1997


     Information   Base  (MIB)  for  use  with  network  management
     protocols in the IPv6-based internets.

     This document specifies a MIB module in a manner that is  both
     compliant to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the
     peer SNMPv1 definitions.

     1.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

     The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework presently consists  of
     three major components.  They are:

     o    the SMI, described in RFC 1902 [1] - the mechanisms  used
          for  describing  and  naming  objects  for the purpose of
          management.

     o    the MIB-II, described in  RFC 1213/STD 17 [3] - the  core
          set   of  managed  objects  for  the  Internet  suite  of
          protocols.

     o    RFC 1157 [4] and RFC 1905 [5] which define  two  versions
          of  the  protocol  used  for  network  access  to managed
          objects.

     The Framework permits  new  objects  to  be  defined  for  the
     purpose of experimentation and evaluation.



     1.1.  Object Definitions

     Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information  store,
     termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
     MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract  Syntax  Notation
     One  (ASN.1)  defined  in the SMI.  In particular, each object
     object  type  is   named   by   an   OBJECT   IDENTIFIER,   an
     administratively assigned name.  The object type together with
     an object instance serves  to  uniquely  identify  a  specific
     instantiation  of the object.  For human convenience, we often
     use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer  to  the
     object type.

     Internet-Draft   IPv6 MIB: UDP and TCP Groups    February 1997


     2.  Overview

     This document is the one  in  the  series  of  documents  that
     define  various  MIB  object groups for IPv6. These groups are
     the basic unit of conformance: if the semantics of a group  is
     applicable  to  an  implementation, then it must implement all
     objects in that group.  For example,  an  implementation  must
     implement  the  TCP group if and only if it implements the TCP
     over IPv6 protocol.

     This document defines the UDP and TCP groups of the IPv6 MIB.

     7.  Security Considerations

     Certain management information defined  in  this  MIB  may  be
     considered sensitive in some network environments.

     Therefore,  authentication  of  received  SNMP  requests   and
     controlled access to management information should be employed
     in such environments.
