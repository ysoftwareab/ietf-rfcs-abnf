Introduction</h3>

<p>Designing a routing protocol for Low power and Lossy link Networks
      (LLNs) imposes great challenges, mainly due to low data rates, high
      probability of packet delivery failure, and strict energy constraint in
      nodes. The IETF ROLL Working Group took on this task and specified the
      Routing Protocol for Low power and Lossy Networks (RPL) in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-rpl'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;rpl]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Winter, T., Thubert, P., et al., &ldquo;RPL: Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks,           draft-ietf-roll-rpl-04 (work in progress),&rdquo; November 2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>RPL is designed to meet the core requirements specified in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-home-routing-reqs'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;home&#8209;routing&#8209;reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Brandt, A., Buron, J., and G.

</p>
<p>This document’s contribution is to provide a performance evaluation
      of RPL with respect to several metrics of interest. This is acomplished
      using real data and topologies in a discrete event simulator, developed
      to reproduce the protocol behavior in detail.
</p>
<p>The following metrics are evaluated:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Path quality metrics;
</li>
<li>Control plane overhead;
</li>
<li>End to End delay between nodes;
</li>
<li>Ability to cope with unstable situations (link churns, node
          dying);
</li>
<li>Required resource constraints on nodes (routing table size,
          etc.).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
</p>
<p>Although simulation cannot prove formally that a protocol operates
      properly in all situations, it can give a good level of confidence in
      protocol behavior in highly stressful conditions, if and only if real
      life data are used. Simulation is particularly useful when theoretical
      model assumptions may not be applicable to such networks and scenarios.
      In this document, real deployed network data traces have been used to
      model link behaviors and network topology.

Methodology and Simulation Setup</h3>

<p>RPL is simulated using OMNET++ <a class='info' href='#OMNETpp'>[OMNETpp]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Varga, &ldquo;The OMNeT++ Discrete Event Simulation System, in Proceedings           of the European Simulation Multiconference (ESM'2001),&rdquo; June 2001.</span><span>)</span></a>, a
      well-known discrete event based simulator written in C++ and NED.
      Castalia-2.2 <a class='info' href='#Castalia-2.2'>[Castalia&#8209;2.2]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Boulis, A., &ldquo;Castalia: Revealing pitfalls in designing distributed           algorithms in WSN, in Proceedings of the 5th international           conference on Embedded networked sensor systems (SenSys'07),&rdquo; 2007.</span><span>)</span></a> has been used as
      Wireless Sensor Network Simulator framework within OMNET++. The output
      and events in the simulating are visualized with the help of the Network
      AniMator or NAM, which is distributed with NS (Network Simulator)<a class='info' href='#NS-2'>.<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;The Network Simulator-2, http://www.isi.edu/nsnam/ns/,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> [NS&#8209;2]
</p>
<p>Note that NS or any of its versions are not used in this simulation
      study. Only the visualization tool was borrowed for verification
      purposes.
</p>
<p>In contrast with theoretical models, which as stated before may have
      assumptions not applicable to lossy links, real-life data has been used
      for two aspects of the simulations:
</p>
<p>* Link failure model: Time varying real network traces containing
      packet delivery probability for each link, over all channels for both
      indoor network deployment and outdoor network deployment.
</p>
<p>* Topology: Gathered from real-life deployment (traces mentioned
      above) as opposed to random topology simulations.
</p>
<p>A 45 node topology, deployed as an outdoor network, shown in Figure
      1, and a 2442 node topology, gathered from a deployment of smart meter
      network, was used in the simulations.
</p>
<p>
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>Figure 1</pre></div>
<p>Figure 1: 45 nodes outdoor network topology.
</p>
<p>Note that this is just a start to validate the simulation before
      using large scale networks.
</p>
<p>A database of time varying link quality data, gathered from real
      network deployment, was created. Each link in the topology randomly
      'picks up' a link model from the database. Each link has a Packet
      Delivery Ratio (PDR) that varies with time (in the simulation, a new PDR
      is read from the database every 10 minutes) according to the gathered
      data. Packets are dropped randomly from that link with probability (1 -
      PDR). Each time a packet is about to be sent, the module generates a
      random number using the Mersenne Twister Random number generation
      method. The random number is compared to the PDR to determine whether
      the packet should be dropped. Note that each link uses a different
      random number generator to maintain true randomness in the simulator,
      and to avoid correlation between links. Also, the packet drop applies to
      all kinds of data and control packets (RPL) such as the DIO, DAO, DIS
      packets defined in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-rpl'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;rpl]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Winter, T., Thubert, P., et al., &ldquo;RPL: Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks,           draft-ietf-roll-rpl-04 (work in progress),&rdquo; November 2009.</span><span>)</span></a>. Figure 2
      shows typical temporal characteristics of some links in the network for
      the indoor network trace used in the simulations.

<p>Figure 2: Example of link characteristics.
</p>
<p>In the RPL simulator, the LBR first initiates sending out DIO
      messages, and the DAG is gradually constructed. RPL makes use of trickle
      timers: I_min is initially set to 1 second and I_doubling is equal to
      16, so that maximum time between two consecutive DIO emissions by a node
      (under a steady network condition) is 18.2 hours. The trickle time
      interval for emitting DIO message assumes the initial value of 1 second,
      and then changes over simulation time as mentioned in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-rpl'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;rpl]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Winter, T., Thubert, P., et al., &ldquo;RPL: Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks,           draft-ietf-roll-rpl-04 (work in progress),&rdquo; November 2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.

      populate the routing tables with the prefixes received from children via
      the DAO messages to support Point to Point (P2P) and Point to Multipoint
      traffic (P2MP) in the "down" direction. In this revision of the
      document, it is assumed that each node is capable of storing route
      information for other nodes in the network. In further revisions, nodes
      without storage capability will be added to the network to see the
      influence of extra states on the nodes and the additional control plane
      overhead to propagate the route records given by Reverse Route Stacks in
      the DAO messages.
</p>
<p>For nodes implementing RPL, as expected, the routing table memory
      requirement varies according to the position in the DAG. The worst-case
      assumption that there is no route summarization in the network is made.
      Thus a node closer to the DAG will have to store more routing entries.
      Further revision of this document will explore the influence of
      performing route summarization along the DAG, which could be performed
      thanks to a newly defined Objective Function or new address provisioning
      techniques. It is also assumed that all nodes have equal memory capacity
      to store the routing states, therefore no source routing is
      required.
</p>
<p>For Simulation of the indoor network, each node sends traffic
      according to a Constant Bit Rate (CBR) to all other nodes in the
      network, over the simulation period. To simulate a more realistic
      scenario, 20% of the generated packets by each node are destined to the
      root, and the remaining 80% of the packets are uniformly assigned as
      destined to nodes other than the root. Therefore the root receives a
      considerably larger amount of data than other nodes. These values may be
      revised when studying P2P traffic so as to have a majority of traffic
      going to all nodes as opposed to the root. In the later part of the
      simulation, a typical home/building routing scenario was also simulated
      and different path quality metrics were computed for that traffic
      pattern.
</p>
<p>The packets are routed through the DAG built by RPL according to the
      mechanisms specified in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-rpl'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;rpl]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Winter, T., Thubert, P., et al., &ldquo;RPL: Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks,           draft-ietf-roll-rpl-04 (work in progress),&rdquo; November 2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>A number of RPL parameters are studied (such as Packet Rate from each
      source, Time Period of the LBR emitting new DAG Sequence Number) to
      observe their effect on the performance metric of interest.

Common Assumptions</h3>

<p>As the DAO messages are used to feed the routing tables in the

        constraint was not imposed on the size of this table nor on how much
        information the node can store. Currently, the routing table size is
        not expressed in terms of Kbyte of memory usage but measured in terms
        of number of entries for each node. Each entry has the next hop node
        and path cost associated with the destination node. In further
        revision of this document, a single full 128-bit address per leaf plus
        a few bits to store other information and flags will be used.

Path Quality</h3>

<p>Number of Hops: For each source-destination pair, the average
        number of hops for both RPL and shortest path routing is computed.
        Shortest path routing refers to a hypothetical ideal routing protocol
        that would always provide the shortest path in term of path cost ETX
        (or whichever metric is used) in the network. The Cumulative
        Distribution Function (CDF) of hop distance for all paths (n*(n-1) in
        an n-node network) in the network with respect to the number of hops
        is plotted in Figure 3 for both RPL and shortest path routing. One can
        observe that the CDF corresponding to 4 hops is around 80% for RPL and
        90% for shortest path routing. In other words, for the given topology,
        90% of paths have a path length of 4 hops or less with an ideal
        shortest path routing methodology, whereas in RPL Point-to-Point (P2P)
        routing, 90% of the paths will have a length of no more than 5 hops.
        This result indicates that despite having a non-optimized P2P routing
        scheme, the path quality of RPL is not much worse than an optimized
        one for the topology in consideration. Another reason for this may
        relate to the fact that the sink is at the center of the network,
        thus routing through the sink is often close to an optimal (shortest
        path) routing. This result may be different in a topology where the
        sink is located at one end of the network.

<p>Figure 3: CDF: hop distance versus number of
          hops.
</p>
<p>Path Cost ETX: The path cost ETX along the path is computed for
        each source-destination pair. Figure 4 shows the CDF of the total
        number of ETX to deliver a packet from a source to any destination
        node with respect to path cost ETX of the path from each source to
        each destination in the network, for both RPL and shortest path
        routing. Here also one observes that the path cost ETX along the path
        from all source to all destination is close to that of a shortest path
        routing for the network in the simulation.

<p>Path Stretch: In this simulation, the path stretch is also
        calculated for each packet that traversed the network. The path
        stretch is determined as the difference between the number of hops
        taken by a packet while following a route built via RPL and the number
        of hops taken by shortest path routing (using link ETX as the metric).
        Once again, the CDF of path stretch is plotted against the value of
        path stretch for different packets in Figures 5 and 6 for hop count
        stretch and ETX metric stretch, respectively.

        Figure 8 shows the upper bound and distributions of delay in Point to

        for different hop counts between source and destination. Here, the hop

        path distance between two nodes. Each packet has a length of 127

Control Packet Overhead</h3>

<p>The control plane overhead is an important routing metric in LLNs.
        It is imperative to bound the control plane overhead. One of the
        distinctive characteristics of RPL is that it makes use of trickle
        timers so as to reduce the number of control plane packets by
        eliminating redundant messages. The aim of this metric is thus to
        analyse the control plane overhead in stable condition (no network
        element failure overhead) and in the presence of failures.
</p>
<p>Data and control plane traffic comparison for each node: Figure 9
        shows the comparison of the amount of data packets transmitted
        (including forwarded) and control packets (DIO and DAO messages)
        transmitted for each node when minimizing ETX is used by the OCP along
        the DAG. Here one can observe that considerable amount of traffic is
        routed through the sink itself. This result also reinforces the fact
        that the amount of control traffic in the protocol is negligible. As
        expected, the nodes closer to sink and that act as forwarders handle
        much more data traffic than other nodes. The leaf nodes have
        comparable amount of data and control packet transmission, as they do
        not take part in routing data.
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>Figure 9</pre></div>
<p>Figure 9: Amount of data and control packets transmitted
          for each node when minimizing ETX is used OCP along the
          DAG.
</p>
<p>Data and Control Packet Transmission with Respect to Time: In
        Figures 10, 11 and 12, the amount of data and control packets
        transmitted for node 12 (low rank in DAG, closer to the root), node 43
        (in the middle) and node 31 (leaf node) are shown, respectively. These
        values stand for number of packets transmitted for each 10 minute
        intervals, to help understand what is the density of data and control
        packet exchange in the network. One can observe that nodes closer to
        the sink have larger amount of data, and the amount of control traffic
        is negligible in comparison to the data traffic. Also, the variation
        in data traffic is much larger for a node closer to sink, because the
        destination of the packets varies over time, and 20% of the packets
        are destined to the sink. For the nodes that are farther away from
        sink, the variation in data traffic becomes smaller, and the amount of
        data traffic is also smaller.
</p>
<p>The control traffic exhibits a wave-like pattern. The amount of
        control packets for each node drops quickly as the DAG stabilizes due
        to the effect of trickle timer. However, as a new DAG Sequence is
        advertised, the trickle timers are reset and the nodes start emitting
        DIOs frequently again to stabilize the DAG. In a node closer to sink,
        the amount of data packets is much larger than that of control
        packets, and somewhat oscillatory around a mean value. The amount of
        control packets exhibits a 'saw-tooth' behavior, mainly because the
        ETX link metric was used, and because when the PDR changes, the ETX
        path cost for a child node to its parent changes, which results in
        changing the DAG rank of the child. This event resets the trickle
        timer and triggers the emission of new DIO. Also, issue of a new DAG
        Sequence Number triggers DAG recomputation and resets the trickle
        timers. Therefore, one can observe that the number of control packets
        attains a high value for one interval, and comes down to lower values
        for subsequent intervals. For leaf nodes, the amount of control
        packets is larger than that of data packets, as leaf nodes are more
        prone to face changes in their DAG rank as opposed to nodes closer to
        sink when the link ETX value in the topology changes dynamically.

Loss of connectivity</h3>

<p>Upon link failures, a node may lose his parents: preferred and
        backup (if any) and its sibling (if any). In this case, if a packet
        has to be sent and the routing table does not contain an entry for the
        corresponding destination, the packet is dropped. RPL proposes two
        mechanism for DAG repairs, known as global repair and local repair. In
        this version of the document, simulation results are presented to
        evaluate the amount of time packets are lost because of loss of
        connectivity for two cases: a) when only global repair mechanism is
        implemented (i.e., periodic emission of new DAG Sequence Numbers by
        the DODAG root), and b) when poisoning the sub-DAG is used in case of
        unreachability of any parent or sibling node to forward data along
        with global repair mechanism. The idea is to tune the frequency at
        which new DAG Sequence Numbers are generated by the DAG root that are
        used for global repair, and also to observe the effect of the same
        when local repair is used in conjunction. It is expected that a higher
        frequency will lead to shorter duration of connectivity loss at a
        price of a higher rate of control packet in the network. For local
        repair, the simulation results show the trade-off in amount of time
        that a node may remain without service and total number of control
        packets for extra bit of signalling.
</p>
<p>Figure 13 shows the CDF of time spent by any node without service,
        when the packet rate from the sources is a packet each 10 seconds, and
        new DAG Sequence Number is issued every 10 minutes. This plot reflects
        the property of global repair without any local repair scheme. When
        all the parents (and siblings) are temporarily unreachable from a
        node, the time before it hears a DIO from another node is recorded,
        which gives the time without service. In some cases, this value might
        go up to the DAG Repair Timer value, because until a DIO is heard,
        there is a lack of connectivity.
</p>
<p>The effect of the DAG Repair Timer on time without service is
        plotted in Figure 14, where the source rate is 20 seconds/packet and
        in Figure 15, where the source sends a packet every 10 seconds.

</p>
<p>Figure 16 shows the effect of DAG global repair timer period on
        control traffic. As expected, as the frequency at which new DAG
        Sequence Numbers are generated increases, the amount of control
        traffic also decreases because the trickle interval gets larger for
        each node, which is pretty intuitive. However this smaller amount of
        control traffic comes at a price of increased time for loss of
        connectivity.

RPL in a building routing scenario</h3>

<p>Unlike the previous traffic pattern, where a majority of the total
      traffic generated by any node is destined to the root, this section
      considers a different traffic pattern, which is more prominent in home
      or building routing scenario. A node sends 60% of its total generated
      traffic to its physically 1-hop distant nodes, 20% of traffic to its
      2-hop distant nodes. The rest of the traffic is once again distributed
      among all other nodes in the network. The CDF of average hop distance
      path stretch in terms of hop distance, ETX path cost and delay for P2P
      routing for all pair of nodes is calculated. Maintaining low delay bound
      for P2P traffic is of high importance in this traffic scenario, as the
      applications in home and building routing has typically low delay
      tolerance.

        RPL is considered. Figure 25 shows how the end-to-end packet latency
        is distributed for different packets with different hop counts in the

RPL in a Large Scale Network</h3>

<p>In this section we focus on analyzing how RPL operates in a large
      network by focusing on a few metrics: the latency and path cost stretch
      for performance; and the amount of control packets for scalability. RPL
      is simulated in a 2442 node smart meter network to observe the effect of
      these metrics as the network size grow larger. We also use the
      corresponding gathered link traces to simulate the packet drop pattern
      in the network. To simulate a more realistic scenario for a smart meter
      network, 100% of the generated packets by each node are destined to the
      root, and no traffic is generated for nodes other than the root.

Path Quality</h3>

<p>To investigate whether RPL scales well with the size of the
        network, the CDF of ETX path cost in the large scale smart meter
        network is compared to a hypothetical ideal shortest path routing
        protocol which minimizes the total ETX count over the path (Figure
        26). In this simulation, the path stretch is also calculated for each
        packet that traversed the network. The path stretch is determined as
        the difference between the number of Expected Transmission (ETX
        Metric) taken by a packet while following a route built via RPL and
        the same metric taken by shortest path routing (by using link ETX as
        the metric). Here, the CDF of fractional path stretch, which is
        determined as the path stretch value over the path cost of an ideal
        shortest path, is plotted in Figure 27. The same fractional path
        stretch value for hop distance is shown in Figure 28.

Control Packet Overhead</h3>

<p>Figure 30 shows the comparison of the amount of data packets
        transmitted (including forwarded) and control packets (DIO and DAO
        messages) transmitted for each node when minimizing ETX is used as the
        link metric to optimize the DAG. Here one can observe that in spite of
        the large scale of the network, the amount of control traffic in the
        protocol is negligible in comparison to data packet transmission.
        Also, as expected, we can observe from Figures 31, 32, 33 that the
        nodes closer to sink and that act as routers have much more data
        packet transmission than other nodes. The leaf nodes have comparable
        amount of data and control packet transmission, as they do not take
        part in routing the data. As seen before, the data traffic for a child
        node has much less variation than the nodes which are closer to the
        sink. This variation decreases with increase in DAG depth.

Scaling Property and Routing Stability</h3>

<p>An important metric of interest in low power devices is the maximum 
      load experienced by any sensor node CPU in terms of number of control 
      packets transmitted by the node. Also, to get an idea of scaling 
      property of the network, it is also crucial to analyze the amount of 
      packets handled by the nodes in different sizes of network. In the 
      simulation, at any given interval, the node with maximum control overhead
      load is identified. The amount of maximum control overhead processed by 
      that node is plotted against time for three different network under study. 
      The first one is Network 'A', which has 45 nodes and is shown in figure 
      1 in section 3; Network 'B', which is another deployed outdoor network
      with 86 nodes; and finally, Network 'C', which is the large deployed
      smart meter network being considered in this draft. In figure 35, the
      comparison of maximum control load is demonstrated for different
      network scale.
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>Figure 35</pre></div>
<p>Figure 35: Scaling property of maximum control packets
        processed by any node over time.
</p>
<p>For a network built with low power devices with lossy links, it is
      important that the routing information is not flooded to the entire 
      network, and that the routing structure is kept as stable as possible. 
      Any change in routing information, specially parent-child relationship,
      would reset the timer to emit new DIOs, and hence, change the node's 
      path metric to reach the root. This change will trigger a large number 
      of control information broadcasts in the sub-DAG, and would multiply 
      its way to the leaves of the network. Therefore, it is important to 
      consider the correct moment for triggering new DIO control packets, and 
      accordingly define a threshold to control when it should be inevitable 
      to release new RA-DIOs with reset timers.
</p>
<p>In this study, the effect of the tolerance value befored emitting new
      RA-DIO with new metric value to root is analyzed to help answer the 
      question, "How much change should the protocol ignore?". Four cases are 
      considered in this study to compare the path stretch factor and change 
      in routing path.
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>No change in DAG depth of a node is ignored.
</li>
<li>The implementation ignores 10% of change, so that if the change in
        depth due to DIO reception from a parent is less than $10\%$, the node 
	will not advertise the new metric to the root,
</li>
<li>The implementation ignores 20% change in the DAG depth of a node
	before deciding to advertise a new depth, and
</li>
<li>The implementation ignores 30% change in the DAG depth of a node
	before deciding to advertise a new depth.
</li>
</ul>

<p>This decision does affect the optimum path quality to the root. As 
      observed in Figure 36, for 0% tolerance, 95% of paths used have a
      stretch factor less than 5%. Similarly, for 10% and 20% tolerance
      level, 95% of paths will have a 15% and 20% fractional path stretch.
      However, the increased routing stability and decreased control overhead 
      is the profit we gain from the 10% extra increase in path length or ETX,
      whichever is used as the metric to optimize DAG.

<p>Figure 36: Fractional stretch factor for different
	tolerance level.
</p>
<p>As the abovementioned threshold also affects the path taken by a 
      packet, this study also demonstrate the effect of the threshold on 
      number of times P2P paths are changed between source and destinaton 
      pair. For Network 'A' shown and discussed in figure 1 in section 3
      and the large Smart meter nework, the CDF of path change is plotted 
      against fraction of path change for different threshold of emitting a 
      new DIO when the metric  cost to LBR changes. For figure 37 and figure 
      38, we plot the fraction of times a path was changed (for each source 
      destination pair) in X axis. If there have been X packets transferred 
      from source A, to destination B, and out of X times, Y times the path 
      between this source Destination pair is changed , then x axis indicates 
      Y/X * 100% . In vertical Axis , CDF is plotted.

</p>
<p>This draft also compares the CDF of fraction of path change for 
      three different networks; Network 'A' with 45 nodes, Network 'B' with 
      86 nodes, and the smart meter network with 2442 nodes as Network 'C'.
      Figure 39 demonstrates how the three networks exhibit change of P2P
      routing path when 30% change in metric  cost to the root is ignored 
      before shifting to a new parent.
