1.  Introduction

   RFC 6761 [RFC6761] specified mechanisms for reserving a top level
   name in the DNS.

   This reversed a prior decision documented by RFC 2860 [RFC2860] to
   close off mechanisms for name assignment in the IETF, the function
   being recognized as vesting with ICANN.

   There is explicit language in RFC2860 which reserved a technical
   function role in domain names:

      4.3.  Two particular assigned spaces present policy issues in
      addition to the technical considerations specified by the IETF:
      the assignment of domain names, and the assignment of IP address
      blocks.  These policy issues are outside the scope of this MOU.

      Note that (a) assignments of domain names for technical uses (such
      as domain names for inverse DNS lookup), (b) assignments of
      specialised address blocks (such as multicast or anycast blocks),
      and (c) experimental assignments are not considered to be policy
      issues, and shall remain subject to the provisions of this
      Section 4.

   In hindsight, re-opening a registry for special cases of technical
   merit inside IETF process has turned out to be a mistake, and
   introduces procedural issues which cannot be adequately addressed
   solely inside a technical process, instead instantiating mechanisms
   which bypass ICANN process.

   The apparent absence of an appropriate technology driven admission
   process inside ICANN methods to assign top level domain names is
   regrettable, but the solution does not lie in vesting the IETF with
   an admissions process.  This has invited (and led to) domain
   squatting, spurious technical arguments, and has destroyed any
   functional vision of an architecture, replacing it with unrelated

   competing requests for more and more names.  This is simply not
   appropriate use of the IETF process.

   Accordingly, this document formally closes the RFC6761 process.  No
   more requests will be entertained in this process and all existing
   names are grandfathered in, but will be relinquished gracefully
   should the technical requirement be demonstrated not to apply any
   more at scale.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Acknowledgements

   This document was written hurredly.  But the intent should be clear.

3.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is directed to close the Special Use Domain Name registry,
   and MUST NOT admit any further entries in this registry.

4.  Security Considerations

   No new security considerations are introduced by this document.  All
   existing security considerations from prior names in the special-use
   names registry are assumed to continue to exist.
