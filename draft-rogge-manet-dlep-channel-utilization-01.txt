1.  Introduction

   The Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) is defined in [RFC8175].
   It provides the exchange of link-related control information between
   DLEP peers.  DLEP peers are comprised of a modem and a router.  DLEP
   defines a base set of mechanisms as well as support for possible
   extensions.  This document defines one such extension.  Radio channel
   utilization provides a packet/frame independent measurement how a
   radio channel is used and how much resources are still available.
   This allows a router to calculate a better routing metric or allows
   management agents to detect a channel being unusable for
   communication because of external jamming.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   In many IETF documents, several words, when they are in all capitals
   as shown below, are used to signify the requirements in the
   specification.  These capitalized words can bring significant clarity
   and consistency to documents because their meanings are well defined.
   This document defines how those words are interpreted in IETF
   documents when the words are in all capitals.

   *  These words can be used as defined here, but using them is not
      required.  Specifically, normative text does not require the use
      of these key words.  They are used for clarity and consistency
      when that is what's wanted, but a lot of normative text does not
      use them and is still normative.

   *  The words have the meanings specified herein only when they are in
      all capitals.

   *  When these words are not capitalized, they have their normal
      English meanings and are not affected by this document.

   Authors who follow these guidelines should incorporate this phrase
   near the beginning of their document: The key words "MUST", "MUST
   NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119]
   [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown
   here.

2.  Extension Usage and Identification

   The use of the Channel Utilization Extension SHOULD be configurable.
   To indicate that the Channel Utilization Extension is to be used, an
   implementation MUST include the Radio Channel Utilization Extension
   ID in the Extensions Supported Data Item.  The Extensions Supported
   Data Item is sent and processed according to [RFC8175].

   All four Data Items are time measurements in nanoseconds since an
   arbitrary starting point, e.g. the radio bootup.  They are never
   reseted and will just increase monotonic.

   The first Data Item (Radio Channel Active) announces the channels
   livetime of the radio channel while the other three provide the
   amount of time the channel has been used in different ways.  Radio
   Channel Rx provides the time the radio is receiving data, Radio
   Channel Tx the time the radio is sending data and Radio Channel Busy
   the time the radio channel is blocked for any unknown reason.

   A radio that doesn't track the time for receiving and transmitting
   data explicitly can just add all times the radio channel is not free
   into the Radio Channel Busy Data Item.

   The time the radio channel has been free can be calculated by
   substracting the values of Busy, Rx and Tx from the value provided by
   the Radio Active Channel Data Item.

3.  Data Items

   All four Data Items of this extension can be used both as Session
   specific and Destination specific metrics.  If the radio is only
   tracking channel usage on interface level, the Data Items are used in
   SessionInitResponse and SessionUpdate messages.  If the radio also is
   tracking channel usage for each Destination, they are also used in
   DestinationUp, DestinationUpdate and DestinationAnnounceResponse
   messages.

3.1.  Radio Channel Active Data Item

   Radio Channel Active Item contains information how long the radio
   channel has been active.  This provides the router with a reference
   to interpret the values provided by the other three Data Items.
   Because of this the value in this item must be larger than the values
   in the other three Data Items this extensions defines together.

   This Data Item is mandatory for SessionInitResponse and SessionUpdate
   messages.

   The format of the Radio Channel Active Data Item is:

   0                   1                   2                   3

   Active Time:  Time in nanoseconds since the channel has been active.

3.2.  Radio Channel Busy Data Item

   Radio Channel Busy Item contains information how much time the radio
   channel has been busy, not including the time provided in the Channel
   Rx and Chanel Tx Data Item.

   This Data Item is mandatory for SessionInitResponse and SessionUpdate
   messages.

   The format of the Radio Channel Busy Data Item is:

   Tx Time:  Time in nanoseconds the local radio was transmitting data
      to other radios during its active time.

4.  Security Considerations

   The extension introduces a new Data Item for DLEP.  The extension
   does not inherently introduce any additional vulnerabilities above
   those documented in [RFC8175].  The approach taken to security in
   that document applies equally when running the extension defined in
   this document.

5.  IANA Considerations

   As described below, IANA has assigned two values per this document.
   Both assignments are to registries defined by [RFC8175].

5.1.  Extension Type Value

   IANA has assigned the following value in the "Extension Type Values"
   registry within the "Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP)
   Parameters" registry.  The new value is in the range with the
   "Specification Required" [RFC8126] policy:
