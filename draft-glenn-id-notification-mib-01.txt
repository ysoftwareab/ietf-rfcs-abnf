Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines the contents of messages that will be
   exchanged among intrusion detection systems when an intrusion is
   detetcted. It also allows the message exchange system to be
   configured.

1.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC
        1215 [RFC1215]. The second version, called SMIv2, is described
        in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and RFC 2580
        [RFC2580].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second version of the
        SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901]
        and RFC 1906 [RFC1906]. The third version of the message
        protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906],
        RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second set of
        protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
        RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
        in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine

Internet Draft                                           October 23 1999

   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

2.  The Intrusion detection Message Exchange model.

       An Intrusion Detection system (ID1) generally comprises an
       Analyzer which scans Data Sources for signs of intrusions. When
       it detects a sign or a signature an event occurs and the analyzer
       then sends a Message or Alert to the Manager(s). Managers in turn
       may exchange Messages or Alerts for cooperative or collaborative
       purposes.

   3.  MIB Model for ID Message Exchanges.

   In Intrusion detection and management, the communication between the
   different components of the system will essentially be event based.
   Presumably, some components (analysers or agents) will be assigned
   the tasks for watching some data-sources and looking out for signs of
   (attepmpted) intrusions or attacks. In case any such sign is detected
   it is brought to the notice of the Manager. The Manager will then
   take the appropriate action which may involve relaying the
   notification and/or carrying out further investigation by talking to
   peers, higher level managers and/or the entity that originated the
   notification.

   The investigation carried out by the manager will possibly involve
   getting
       o more information on some of the fields that are
         present in the messages from the agents. [Maybe using Http,
         ftp ]
       o more host-related information on the circumstances under which
         the intrusion/attack was detected - this may involve fetching
         further information from the various MIBs of the entity that
         originated the notification.
       o more network-related information on the circumstances under
         which the intrusion/attack was detected - this may involve
         fetching further information from the various MIBs of the
         relevant network entities in the network

   The notification to the manager will take the form of an inform-
   request.  There may be several types of notifications. The constraint
   on a notification is its size. It is desirable that the packet
   carrying the notification  is not fragmented at the IP level.

The MIB defined in this document covers the  portion  which is  specific
to the Intrusion Detection Message itself. The other components of
information that may be of relevance to the investigation will probably
be found in the various MIBs defined. If they are absent then newer MIBs
will have to be defined.

4.  MIB design.

The basic principle has been to keep the MIB as simple as  possible.
The generic requirements on the message are
       o ID messages should contain the minimum information required

Internet Draft                                           October 23 1999

         by the manager to assess the situation correctly and to take
         appropriate defensive or investigative steps.
       o ID messages, if carried in UDP datagrams, should not be
         too large as to require IP fragmentation. Moreover if the SNMP
         protocol is being used, some managers may not accept SNMP-PDUs
         that are larger than 484 bytes. Over other transports this
         problem may not be encountered.

      The MIB comprises of two parts, the idMesageObjects and idMessages
      described below.
      - The idMessageObjects subtree defines the objects that are used
        in the notifications

      - The idMessages subtree defines the actual messages.

Security Considerations

   There are management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX-
   ACCESS clause of read-write and read-create. There is the risk that
   an intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   via direct SNMP SET operations. So, care must be taken to put in place
   the security provisions of SNMP for authentication and access control.
   Not all versions of SNMP provide features for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the
   network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET (read) and SET (write) the objects in this MIB.

   It is strongly recommended that the implementors consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2274 [RFC2274] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2275 [RFC2275] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to those objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.
