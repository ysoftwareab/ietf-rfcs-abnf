Abstract

   This document provides an overview of attribute types and object 
   classes defined by the ISO/IEC JTC1 and ITU-T committees in the 
   IS0/IEC 9594 and X.500 documents, in particular those intended for 
   use by directory clients.  This is the most widely used schema for 
   LDAP/X.500 directories.  It is used as a basis for many other white 
   pages objects schema definitions.  This document does not cover 
   attributes used for the administration of X.500 directory servers, 
   nor does it include attributes defined by other ISO/ITU-T documents.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.  General Issues

   This document references Syntaxes given in Section 3 of [Syntaxes] 
   and Matching Rules specified in Section 4 of [Syntaxes].

   The definitions of Attribute Types and Object Classes are written 
   using the ABNF form of AttributeTypeDescription and 
   ObjectClassDescription given in [Models].  Lines have been folded 
   for readability.


2.  Source

   The schema definitions in this document are based on those found in 
   the X.500-series [X.509], [X.520], and [X.521], specifically:

        Sections             Source
        ============         =============
        3.1  - 3.42          X.520 [X.520]
        3.43                 X.509 [X.509]
        3.44 - 3.45          X.520 [X.520]
        4.1  - 4.14          X.521 [X.521]


3. Attribute Types

   The Attribute Types contained in this section hold user information.

   There is no requirement that servers implement the following 
   Attribute Types: 

       knowledgeInformation
       searchGuide
       teletexTerminalIdentifier

   In fact, their use is greatly discouraged.

   An LDAP server implementation SHOULD recognize the rest of the 
   Attribute Types described in this section.

3.1  businessCategory

   This Attribute Type describes the kind of business performed by 
   an organization.

   ( 2.5.4.15 NAME 'businessCategory' 
      EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
      SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
      SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15{128} ) 

   The SYNTAX oid indicates the Directory String syntax.

3.2  c

   This is the X.520 [X.520] countryName Attribute Type, which contains 
   a two-letter ISO 3166 [ISO3166]country code.

   ( 2.5.4.6 NAME 'c' 
      SUP name 
      SINGLE-VALUE )

3.3  cn

   This is the X.520 [X.520] commonName Attribute Type, which contains 
   a name of an object.  If the object corresponds to a person, it is 
   typically the person's full name.

   ( 2.5.4.3 NAME 'cn' 
      SUP name )

3.4  description

   This Attribute Type contains a human-readable description of 
   the object. 

   ( 2.5.4.13 NAME 'description' 
      EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
      SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
      SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15{1024} ) 

   The SYNTAX oid indicates the Directory String syntax.

3.5  destinationIndicator

   This attribute is used for the telegram service.

   ( 2.5.4.27 NAME 'destinationIndicator' 
      EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
      SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
      SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.44{128} ) 

   The SYNTAX oid indicates the Printable String syntax.

3.6  distinguishedName

   This Attribute Type is not used as the name of the object itself, 
   but it is instead a base type from which attributes with DN syntax 
   inherit.

   It is unlikely that values of this type itself will occur in an 
   entry.  LDAP server implementations which do not support attribute 
   subtyping need not recognize this attribute in requests.  Client 
   implementations MUST NOT assume that LDAP servers are capable of 
   performing attribute subtyping.

   ( 2.5.4.49 NAME 'distinguishedName' 
      EQUALITY distinguishedNameMatch
      SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.12 )

   The SYNTAX oid indicates the DN syntax.

3.7  dnQualifier

   The dnQualifier Attribute Type specifies disambiguating information 
   to add to the relative distinguished name of an entry.  It is 
   intended for use when merging data from multiple sources in order to 
   prevent conflicts between entries which would otherwise have the same
   name.  It is recommended that the value of the dnQualifier attribute 
   be the same for all entries from a particular source.

   ( 2.5.4.46 NAME 'dnQualifier' 
      EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
      ORDERING caseIgnoreOrderingMatch 
      SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
      SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.44 ) 

   The SYNTAX oid indicates the Printable String syntax.

3.8  enhancedSearchGuide

   This attribute is for use by X.500 clients in constructing search 
   filters.

   ( 2.5.4.47 NAME 'enhancedSearchGuide'
      SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.21 ) 

   The SYNTAX oid indicates the Enhanced Guide syntax.

3.9  facsimileTelephoneNumber

   A value of this Attribute Type is a telephone number for a facsimile 
   terminal (and, optionally, its parameters).

   ( 2.5.4.23 NAME 'facsimileTelephoneNumber'
     SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.22 ) 

   The SYNTAX oid indicates the Facsimile Telephone Number syntax.

3.10  generationQualifier

   The generationQualifier Attribute Type contains the part of a 
   person's name which typically is the suffix, as in "IIIrd".

   ( 2.5.4.44 NAME 'generationQualifier' 
      SUP name )

3.11 givenName

   The givenName Attribute Type is used to hold the part of a person's 
   name which is not their surname nor middle name.

   ( 2.5.4.42 NAME 'givenName' 
      SUP name )

3.12  houseIdentifier

   This Attribute Type is used to identify a building within a location.

   Transfer of cleartext passwords is strongly discouraged where the 
   underlying transport service cannot guarantee confidentiality and may
   result in disclosure of the password to unauthorized parties.

   It is required that strong authentication be performed in order to 
   modify directory entries using LDAP.

   Several X.500 Attribute Types and Object Classes, such as, the 
   userCertificate Attribute Type or the certificationAuthority Object 
   Class, are used to include key-based security information in 
   directory entries.  The Attribute Types are:  

      authorityRevocationList
      cACertificate
      certificateRevocationList
      crossCertificatePair
      deltaRevocationList
      supportedAlgorithms
      userCertificate

   The Object Classes are:

      certificationAuthority
      certificationAuthority-V2
      cRLDistributionPoint
      strongAuthenticationUser
      userSecurityInformation

   These Attribute Types and Object Classes are specified for LDAP by 
   the PKIX Working Group, and so, are not included in this document.

   It is recommended that the BNF notation in RFC 1778 [Syn String] not 
   be used for User Certificate, Authority Revocation List, and 
   Certificate Pair.

                          Annex A  Change Log


   This annex lists the changes that have been made from RFC 2256 to 
   this I-D.  

   Changes to RFC 2256 resulting in 
   draft-ietf-ldapbis-user-schema-00.txt:

      1.  Revision of the Status of this Memo.

      2.  Dependencies on RFC 1274 have been eliminated.

      3.  The references to X.500(96) have been expressed in terms of 
          the "edition", rather than the standard date.  Note that the 
          version of X.500 which is the basis for this document, is the 
          third edition, which was finalized in 1996, but approved in 
          1997.

      4.  The "teletexTerminalNumber" attribute and syntax are marked 
          as obsolete.

      5.  Removed "The syntax definitions are based on the ISODE "QUIPU"
          implementation of X.500." from section 6.

      6.  Added text to 6.1, the octetString syntax, in accordance 
          with X.520.

      7.  Some of the attribute types MUST be recognized by servers.  
          Also, several attributes are obsolete.  Therefore, the 
          various kinds of attribute types have been placed in separate 
          sections:

            - necessary for the directory to operate (section 3.1) 

            - for holding user information (section 3.2) 

            - superseded or withdrawn (section 3.3).  

      8.  Since "top" may be implicitly specified and  "alias" is not 
          abstract, the last sentence in the description of the 
          "objectClass" attribute type, section 3.1.1, has been deleted.
          The clause that preceded the deleted sentence has been 
          removed, also.

      9.  Add a description to the definition of the "telephoneNumber" 
          attribute type, section 3.2.17.

      10. Add text to mark the "teletexTerminalIdentifier" attribute 
          type as obsolete.

      11. Add a security consideration requiring strong authentication 
          in order to modify directory entries.

INTERNET-DRAFT     draft-ietf-ldapbis-user-schema-03     4 November 2002


   Changes to draft-ietf-ldapbis-user-schema-00.txt, resulting in draft-
   ietf-ldapbis-user-schema-01.txt:
 
      12. Delete the conformance requirement for subschema object 
          classes in favor of a statement in [SYNTAX].

      13. Add a Table of Contents

      14. Replace the term "obsolete" with "superseded or withdrawn" 

      15. Added explanations to many attributes.

      16. In the title, correct the X.500 reference to have the second 
          edition as the basis.

      17. Throughout this I-D, cleaned up whitespace in the BNF 
          definitions.

      18. Removed Section 4, Syntaxes, and Section 6, Matching Rules, 
          (moved to draft-ietf-ldapbis-syntaxes-01.txt).

      19. Reorganized Section 3, Attributes, to eliminate grouping 
          attributes according to conformance requirements.  Reordered 
          Section 3, Attributes, and Section 4, Object Classes, 
          alphabetically.

      20. Added an explanation for each object class.

   Changes to draft-ietf-ldapbis-user-schema-01.txt, resulting in draft-
   ietf-ldapbis-user-schema-02.txt:
 
      21. Removed the certificate-related Attribute Types:  
             authorityRevocationList, 
             cACertificate, 
             certificateRevocationList, 
             crossCertificatePair, 
             deltaRevocationList, 
             supportedAlgorithms, and 
             userCertificate.

          Removed the certificate-related Object Classes:  
             certificationAuthority,
             certificationAuthority-V2,
             cRLDistributionPoint,
             strongAuthenticationUser, and
             userSecurityInformation

          Noted in the Security Considerations (Section 7) that they 
          are covered in PKIX WG documents.

      22. Removed the dmdName Attribute Type and dmd Object Class 
          because they are not in the version of X.500 which 
          is referenced.

      23. Removed embedded comments from the ABNF productions 
          throughout the document.

      24. Cleaned up the references;  adopted word instead of number 
          tags;  split Section 7 into normative and informative 
          subsections.

   Changes to draft-ietf-ldapbis-user-schema-02.txt, resulting in draft-
   ietf-ldapbis-user-schema-03.txt:

......25. Deleted the 'aliasedObjectName' and 'objectClass' attribute 
          type definitions.  They are included in [Models].

          are included in [Models].

      27. Replaced the document title.

      28. Changed reference citations to be consistent with the rest of 
          the LDAPbis documents.
