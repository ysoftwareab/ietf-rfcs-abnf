1. Introduction 

    

   Internet Protocol based Television services (IPTV) are gaining 
   popularity in telecom business circle specially telecom vendors and 
   telecom operators. This service gives high revenue to telecom 
   operators, in turn to telecom vendors, which lose revenue in the 
   traditional voice services. In user point of view, they are able to 
   access high quality video easily using IPTV. High penetration of 
   broadband connectivity, improvement of multimedia codecs, and 
   deployment of flexible triple play service delivery architecture by 
   the operators contribute to the success of IPTV. This growth imposes 
   challenging new requirements for converged media services in terms 
   of flexibility and efficiency.  

   In order to realize the IPTV services based on IP Multimedia 
   Subsystem (IMS), IMS user deploys minimum four protocols such as 
   HTTP, RTP, RTSP and SIP. One of the hurdles today to deliver the SIP 
   services over corporate networks is firewall and NAT traversal. 
   Opening the network other than HTTP/HTTPS still is a question for a 
   network administrator. In some cases, opening the network for RTP 
   and SIP is achieved using SIP and RTP aware firewall or session 
   border controller. Rather than creating one opening for RTSP, it is 
   desirable to have one unified session control protocol. In the 
   client side, having separate persistent connectivity for RTSP, SIP 
   and RTP is not advisable in terms of performance. Therefore, 
   reducing the number of protocol is a right option. At last in the 
   context of IMS based IPTV architecture, SIP is used to manage the 
   session. Extending SIP to manage the media control is a viable 
   solution than deploying other protocol for media control.   

   This document proposes rational for using SIP for a signaling 
   protocol for streaming media applications. 

    

   Note: The purpose of this document is to propose in detail one 
   specific approach, using SIP for streaming-media applications. And, 
   our intent is to stimulate discussion within the IETF community and 
   catalyze future work in this area. To this end, our strategy has 
   been to  

   - develop the rationale for using SIP

              Framework of media control for IPTV services    March 2010 
    

   - evaluate, at a high-level, SIP in the context of converged media 
     services, and  
   - identify, if appropriate, the future developments. 

2. Use Cases for IPTV services 

2.1. Classification of IPTV services  

   Live TV 

   Live TV comprises a one-way transmission of content from one point 
   (the source) to two or more points (the receivers), whereas the end-
   user has no control over the content or timing of what he receives, 
   apart from the ability to select a particular channel. 

   Time-shifted TV 

   Time shifted service provides TV contents to the user which are 
   already been broadcasted. Some contents such as news, weather 
   forecast or popular shows used to be popular and users want to watch 
   them on their feasible time. Service providers store them along the 
   network and serve up on getting the request.   

   VoD 

   Content is prepared and delivered by the content provider for 
   retrieval, which is received and stored in VoD server. If necessary, 
   trans-coding can also be performed to accommodate content with 
   storage device characteristics. End-user can then select and 
   retrieve such contents from this storage at any time, according to 
   the constraints provided by the content protection metadata. 

    

2.2. Use cases and service scenarios for IPTV services 

   Live TV 

   Home users can watch digital TV with the help of IP network which 
   carries TV traffic from service provider to home and digital Set-
   top-box (STB) which converts IP packets into viewable TV format. 
   Multicast channel is used to serve TV channel from proxy server to 
   customer end. Service providers should be tactful to handle bunches 
   of linear TV requests from many users with minimum service delivery 
   latency. Multicast supports many users with single channel. When 
   users want to watch TV, they perform multicast join operation to the 
   stream which is currently serving in proxy server. If the multicast 
 
 
Siva, et al.          Expires September 8, 2010                [Page 6] 
    
              Framework of media control for IPTV services    March 2010 
    

   channel is not available in the current proxy it is required to 
   retrieved from other proxy servers or from head end server at top. 
   Most of the popular channels are static i.e., current proxy has 
   stream of them in advance. However, it is not feasible to make all 
   the channels static on one proxy from resource point of view. Thus, 
   channels other than static are dynamic and take some time before 
   starting playing in user end.  

   Time-shifted TV 

   Users can watch time-shifted TV content through television set or 
   small hand held devices such as Smartphones. People want to watch 
   news while they are in home or outside. In home they can watch live 
   news via television set using STB. However, when they are outside 
   somewhere far from home they should watch using different means. 
   They can watch using Smartphones or other handheld devices. 
   Processing capability and content display format may be different in 
   those devices. Therefore, it is required to adapt content as per the 
   capability of requesting devices. Proxy server may need to perform 
   content adaptation. 

   VoD 

   VoD service acquires video contents in head end server. Users can 
   access VoD service using their TV set in their home or using 
   handheld devices when they are in mobility. A user who is in home 
   watching live TV channel can request some interesting video. Some 
   users who are travelling in car or public transportation can also 
   request the same service. VoD service can be resource intensive when 
   many users access the service at the same time. Therefore, proxy 
   server should use some resource scheduling technique to serve large 
   number of users with limited VoD bandwidth. Batching can be 
   performed to group multiple requests in to a single one. Such 
   scheduling techniques optimize available resource to accommodate 
   many service requesters. 

    

3. Requirements for media control to support IPTV service operation 

3.1. Basic concept of media control for IPTV services  

   The linear TV with trick mode enables the end-user to pause linear 
   TV. For the ability to skip content and for other capabilities (e.g., 
   instant replay), the use of Personal Video Recorder (PVR) is 
   required. PVR provides capability of end-user-controlled electronic 

 
 
Siva, et al.          Expires September 8, 2010                [Page 7] 
    
              Framework of media control for IPTV services    March 2010 
    

   device that records linear TV and stores it in a digital storage 
   facility, either in standalone set-top boxes or in the network.  

   When the end-user's IPTV terminal has its own storage capability and 
   the end-user requests any trick mode function, the programmed 
   content is recorded by the storage function and may be displayed 
   later according to the end-user's selection or the constraints 
   provided by the content protection metadata. If the end-user 
   requests the trick mode service without any local storage capability 
   (e.g., embedded in his or her IPTV terminal), then the programmed 
   content is recorded in the storage facility managed by the service 
   provider. The selected content can then be displayed later by the 
   end-user, according to the constraints provided by the content 
   protection metadata. 

   This capability can support "time-shifting", "trick modes". IPTV 
   terminal device should have the following capabilities: 

   - provide the interface for user to access the contents without time 
     limitation, including pause, rewind, fast forward, etc  
   - provide the interface for user to enable or disable the service of 
     TV with trick mode provide the interface to set the expiration 
     time 
    

3.2. Requirements for media control  

    

   Main requirements of media control in IPTV trick mode operation are 
   associated with media storage. 

   Three explicit situations have been investigated for media storage 
   for more interactive and asynchronous viewing in the IPTV 
   architecture. 

       1. Telco's TV setup boxes or Home gateways. 
       2. Regional server near to DSLAM, which terminates multicast and 
          unicast.  
       3. TV Head End Servers which stores one copy of the content 
          while delivering the live TV.     

   In addition, media delivery method has changed from multicast to P2P 
   distribution or cooperative P2P and multicast system. 


 
 
Siva, et al.          Expires September 8, 2010                [Page 8] 
    
              Framework of media control for IPTV services    March 2010 
    

   These two requirements should be addressed when designing the media 
   control protocol for IPTV services in the context of asynchronous 
   viewing.  

       

4. Protocol solutions for media control to support IPTV services 

4.1. Overview of protocol solutions 

   The following protocol solutions are useful for trick mode 
   operation. . 

       1. RTSP: It is basic solution for Trick mode operation in VoD 
          Services, because end-to-end nature is preserved in most of 
          cases. It means that client and server remains same during 
          the trick mode operation. RTSP protocol generally supports 
          following trick mode operation: playback, stop, pause, fast 
          forward and rewind at different speeds.   
      
        
       2. SIP: SIP is used for controlling multimedia communication 
          sessions, for example in IMS-based IPTV services.  
           
       3. IGMP: Live TV environment works on multicast content delivery. 
          Therefore, IGMP messages(join and leave) are used for trick 
          mode operation. 

    

4.2. New solutions for trick mode operation 

    

   The media control in Time-shift TV gets benefits from P2P SIP. Basic 
   idea is to use the SIP for session and media control. 

   In this section, we mainly focus on Time-shifted TV, where storage 
   facility can be in different places, we consider that regional 
   server keeps the content of the each channel. Each Regional servers 
   and head-ends forms P2P network in order to deliver efficiently. 
   Each client request has Time and Channel parameters for video 
   content.         

   SIP is used to setup or modify or terminating a session. In addition, 
   SIP UPDATE allows a client to update parameters of session.    

 
 
Siva, et al.          Expires September 8, 2010                [Page 9] 
    
              Framework of media control for IPTV services    March 2010 
    

   The solution needs to satisfy the requirements for session setup, 
   media setup and media control. Session setup and media setup are 
   carried out using INVITE message. Trick plays and media control 
   features are mapped to the SIP message, which is UPDATE method. 
   Media control message such as play, pause is transferred from UE 
   using UPDATE message. Therefore, the semantics of SIP session is not 
   changed. 

   In order to differentiate many media control messages, SIP-MEX - new 
   header is defined and included into UPDATE message. 

   Even though, trick plays and media control features has to be 
   handled by SIP, some information has to be passed back to UE from 
   network when some events happen such as pause. Therefore, new header 
   (SIP-MEX) in UPDATE method with new XML body is used in our proposed 
   solution for tricks plays and media control features. This criterion 
   is used to select the UPDATE method. SIP-MEX is not standardized and 
   is used for carrying the media event information.  

   SIP session typically follows the cycle of many session-media states. 
   Session-media states are started, paused, restarted, and end. 
   Restarted happens after media pauses. Mostly, UPDATE is used to 
   change session media state. It means when session is started, 
   issuing an UPDATE command can trigger the state from started to 
   paused. Likewise, paused state can be trigged to restarted state by 
   UPDATE command. These UPDATE will not change the session parameters 
   instead change session-media state of a session. 

   UPDATE will contain SIP-MEX header with value: pause/restart. One 
   important change is that content-type is application/XML not SDP. 
   When UPDATE message is sent from UAC to UAS, it will carry new SIP 
   header called as SIP-MEX. The content type of the response message 
   is XML, which is simple and flexible enough to change.  

   Main difficulty is how to identify that both ends support UPDATE 
   message and understand session-media state. According to RFC 3261, 
   Allow header in the initial invite message and its response can be 
   used to verify that both end supports UPDATE message. Session-media 
   state is understandable by UAS if UAS insert SIP-MEX header into the 
   response of UPDATE message which has SIP-MEX initially.   

   The fast forward and fast backward can be added into session-media 
   states. Parameters, which describe the fast forward and fast 
   backward, can be sent in XML via UPDATE message. In this document, 
   efforts are not devoted to discuss about these cases.

4.3. Demonstration 

   The proposed solution is demonstrated in IPTV context, whose 
   architecture is defined in [TS182027].Our mechanisms mainly work 
   within UE and SCF in the IPTV services. When UE sends the UPDATE 
   message with Pause details, SCF replies with information, which is 
   going to be displayed. Information of trick functions is sent in SIP 
   body. In reply, XML information is sent back to the UE. Based on the 
   unified session control protocol, IPTV architecture will have one 
   modification, which is removing the Xc interface between UE and IPTV 
   media control function. It is not focus of this document.  

   Based on the design, SCF behaves in UA mode and coordinates the MCF 
   via y2 interface. Details of the interface between SCF and MCF are 
   not discussed here. Optionally, SCF can perform in B2BUA mode 
   between user and MCF. In this case, MCF should be SIP aware. These 
   two options are used; because connectivity to MCF and MDF depends on 
   content provider's ability.  

   SCF implements the function, which is responsible to send 
   information (advertisement/recommendation) to the UE when Pause 
   event arrived. Moreover, way the SCF finds the information or 
   advertisement is beyond the scope; SCF may use semantic web services 
   and context enabler services. In the trick function, for example 
   Pause event, UE will send the UPDATE message with SIP-MEX header, 
   which contains of PAUSE event. In response, OK message will carry 
   relevant information in XML format to UE. 

    

4.4. Detailed procedures of Session and media control 

   In the context of on demand service, scenario can be explained as 
   follows. User selects the corresponding the media content from UE, 
   which is identified by URI. Let assume that address of the media 
   content is movie1@vod.ims.eu. 

   Once SCF receives the INVITE message, SCF instructs the media 
   content delivery function to deliver the media. SCF may have one or 
   two different interfaces to the media content delivery function. 

   In Figure 1, SCF is connected to MCF using non-SIP protocol. When 
   Pause happens in UE, UE directly send UPDATE message to SCF. OK 
   message is sent to directly to UE with XML information. Since Figure 
   1 does not show full description of message flow, important messages 
   are shown in the dotted line.

   Alternatively, connectivity between SCF and MCF can be SIP enabled. 
   In this case, SCF can behave like B2BUA or proxy mode, but we choose 
   B2BUA. Because SCF needs to send some information as response to UE 
   when pause event happened. In the proxy mode, MCF will generate the 
   OK response and SCF cannot modify the SDP of the OK message. This 
   model can be used when MCF is responsible to deliver advertisement 
   or information to UE. Alternative scenario, where SCF is in B2BUA 
   and SCF is connected to MCF via SIP interface, is clearly shown in 
   Figure 2.

5. Alternative solution spaces for proposed use-cases 

   - In ordinary case, media control event can be passed to IMS 
     provider by the content provider and then IPTV application 
     triggers the SIP Push to send the information to UE. 
   - Second solution is that SIP is for session management and RTSP is 
     for media signaling. When user pause the VOD service, client can 
     pull information from web server according to currently watching 
     video information. But on the other hand, using proposed unified 
     session control protocol, one advantage is that both ends can send 
     the information to each other compared to HTTP. It means that 
     network enabled pause is possible. Even if network enabled pause 
     takes place, server can send information to client in UPDATE 
     message.  

6. Advantages 

   The approach proposed in section 4 gives the following advantages:  

   - IMS based Telco becomes an efficient context provider who may 
     know the media control. 
   - Easy to implement: Our solution tries to push information to 
     screen where already existing TV is displaying the video. 
     Therefore, we use same dialog (UPDATE/OK) to carry this push 
     information. 
   - This method is relatively simple and easy to adopt in the SIP 
     environment.
