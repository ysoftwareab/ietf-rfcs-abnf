Internet-Draft            Power Consumption MIB            February 2010


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols.  In particular it defines
   objects for monitoring power consumption with IP network element that
   has a function of dynamic performance control.

   The goal of this MIB is the realization of effective reducing power
   consumption for the network element.  Currently, routers and switches
   are able to manage dynamic performance.

   Modern network devices can reduce power consumption by the
   performance control.  This MIB is used to optimize performance.  Some
   routers with a dynamic performance control lowers the operation clock
   frequency when the amount of traffic decreases and suppresses a
   surplus performance.  The performance control is carried out in each
   entity of the device, and it becomes necessary to measure the
   electricity information every entity.

   This MIB is used to know the situation of power consumption and peak
   power.  This makes it possible to know the effect of the power saving
   of the performance control.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   The purpose of this MIB is to provide monitoring power consumption
   information.

Internet-Draft            Power Consumption MIB            February 2010


   The Power Consumption MIB module (POWER-CONSUMPTION-MIB) is designed
   to:

   o  Support monitoring of modules' measured power consumption
      information.

4.1.  The module constitution of the network device

   In order to understand the current power consumption of the entire
   router, you can accomplish with a simple configuration of MIB
   objects.  But if you try to reduce the power consumption of the
   router, you need to get more detailed information.

   This MIB assumes that the router is composed of control plane,
   forwarding plane and network interface.  It thinks about these three
   pieces as an element to control the electric power.  Individual
   information is collected from these modules, and the operational
   condition of each module is understood.

   The judgment whether an appropriate setting can be achieved becomes
   possible by knowing operation information, and it is possible to
   reflect it in the policy decision in the future.  As a result, the
   engine control of three modules achieves reduction of the consumption
   electricity.

4.2.  The peak and minimum power consumption

   The range of power consumption based on the performance setting of
   entity can be understood by acquiring the maximum and minimum amount
   of power consumption, and the effect of the performance setting can
   be confirmed.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This section presents the structure of the POWER CONSUMPTION MIB
   module.  The objects are arranged into the following groups:

   o  pconObjects - defines the objects forming the basis for the POWER
      CONSUMPTION MIB.  These objects are divided up by function into
      the following groups:

      *  Power Consumption Group - This group contains the objects which
         describe power consumption to network device.

   o  pconConformance - defines minimal and full conformance of
      implementations to this POWER CONSUMPTION MIB.

5.1.  Textual Conventions

   o  PowerConUnit:

       Attributes with this syntax are configuration parameters that
       reference the power consumption measurement data unit.

       other(1)    - a measure other than those listed below
       wattSec(2)  - Watt Second[Wsec]
       wattMin(3)  - Watt minute[Wmin]
       wattHour(4) - Watt hour[Wh]

5.2.  The pconPowerCon Group

   The pconPowerCon Subtree reports power consumption information.

        +-- PowerConsUnit         pconPowerConUnit(2)
        +-- ZeroBasedCounter64    pconPowerConValue(3)

   o  pconPowerConScale - This object identifies the scaling factor
      associated with the power consumption value.

   o  pconPowerConUnit - This object identifies the unit associated with
      the power consumption value.

   o  pconPowerConValue - This object identifies the number of power
      consumption.

   o  pconPowerConPeakValue - This object identifies the maximum value
      of power consumption."

   o  pconPowerConPeakTime - This object identifies the time that the
      power consumption at the peak was updated.

   o  pconPowerConPeakReset - This object is used to reset the peak
      value and peak time of power consumption.

   o  pconPowerConMinimumValue - This object identifies the minimum
      value of power consumption."

   o  pconPowerConMinimumTime - This object identifies the time that the
      power consumption at the minimum was updated.

   o  pconPowerConMinimumReset - This object is used to reset the
      minimum value and minimum time of power consumption.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

6.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] is defined as being
   mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a
   whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the management
   entity and certain other system-wide data.  The POWER CONSUMPTION MIB
   does not duplicate those objects.

6.2.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The POWER CONSUMPTION MIB module requires following MIB modules for
   IMPORTS:

   o  SNMPv2-SMI defined in [RFC2578]

   o  SNMPv2-TC defined in [RFC2579]

   o  SNMPv2-CONF defined in [RFC2580]

   o  HCNUM-TC defined in [RFC2856]

   o  ENTITY-MIB defined in [RFC4133]

   o  ENTITY-SENSOR-MIB defined in [RFC3433]

8.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  The value of pconPowerConPeakValue and pconPowerConPeakTime may be
      reset by setting pconPowerConPeakReset = true(1).

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  IANA Considerations


        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------

        pconMIB  { mib-2 XXX }
