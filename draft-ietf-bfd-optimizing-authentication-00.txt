1.  Introduction

   Authenticating every BFD [RFC5880] packet with a Simple Password, or
   with a MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm [RFC1321] , or Secure Hash
   Algorithm (SHA-1) algorithms is computationally intensive process,
   making it difficult if not impossible to authenticate every packet -
   particularly at faster rates.  Also, the recent escalating series of
   attacks on MD5 and SHA-1 [SHA-1-attack1] [SHA-1-attack2] raise
   concerns about their remaining useful lifetime as outlined in Updated
   Security Considerations for the MD5 Message-Digest and the HMAC-MD5
   Algorithm [RFC6151] and Security Considerations for the SHA-0 and
   SHA-1 Message-Digest Algorithm [RFC6194].  If replaced by stronger
   algorithms, the computational overhead, will make the task of
   authenticating every packet even more difficult to achieve.

   This document proposes that only BFD frames that signal a state
   change in BFD be authenticated.  Rest of the frames can be
   transmitted and received without authentication enabled.  Most frames
   that are transmitted and received have no state change associated
   with them.  Limiting authentication to frames that affect a BFD
   session state allows more sessions to be supported for
   authentication.  Moreover, most BFD frames that signal a state change
   are generally transmitted at a slower interval of 1s leaving enough
   time to compute the hash.

Internet-Draft             BFD Authentication              December 2015


   Section 2 talks about the changes to authentication mode as described
   in BFD [RFC5880].

2.  Authentication Mode

   The cryptographic authentication mechanisms specified in BFD
   [RFC5880] describes enabling and disabling of authentication as a one
   time operation.  As a security precaution, it mentions that
   authentication state be allowed to change at most once.  Once
   enabled, every packet must have Authentication Bit set and the
   associated Authentication TLV appended.  In addition, it states that
   an implementation SHOULD NOT allow the authentication state to be
   changed based on the receipt of a BFD Control packet.

   This document proposes that the authentication mode be modified to be
   enabled on demand.  Instead of authenticating every packet, BFD peers
   decide which frames need to be authenticated, and authenticate only
   those frames.  For example, the two ends can decide that BFD frames
   that indicate a state change should be authenticated and enable
   authentication on those frames only.  If the two ends have not
   previously negotiated which frames they will transmit or receive with
   authentication enabled, then the BFD session will fail to come up,
   because at least one end will expect every frame to be authenticated.
   The state changes for which authentication is being suggested
   include:

      Poll Sequence

      Demand Mode

      BFD packet with the Diag flag set

   Authenticated frames already carry the sequence number.  The rest of
   the frames MUST contain the TLV specified in Section 3.  This enables
   a monotonically increasing sequence number to be carried in each
   frame, and prevents man-in-the-middle from capturing and replaying
   the same frame again.

3.  NULL Auth TLV

   This section describes a new Authentication TLV as:

                               NULL Auth TLV

   where:

   TLV Type: The TLV Type.  This field MUST be set to <IANA assigned>.

   TLV Length: The length of the NULL Auth TLV, in bytes i.e. 8 bytes

   Sequence Number: is a monotonically increasing number while the
   session state is UP.  Once the session goes down the Sequence number
   SHOULD be set to 0.

   Sender timestamp: is not used by authentication, and is documented to
   be compatible with BFD Stability [I-D.ashesh-bfd-stability].  It
   should be set to 0, and should be ignored by the receiver.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a new Auth Type for the NULL Auth TLV.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.

5.  Security Considerations

   The approach described in this document enhances the ability to
   authentication a BFD session by taking away the onerous requirement
   that every frame be authenticated.  By authenticating frames that
   affect the state of the session, the security of the BFD session is
   maintained.  As such this document does not change the security
   considerations for BFD.
