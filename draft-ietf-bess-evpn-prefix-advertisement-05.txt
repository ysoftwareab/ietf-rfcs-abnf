                    IP Prefix Advertisement in EVPN
              draft-ietf-bess-evpn-prefix-advertisement-05


Abstract

   EVPN provides a flexible control plane that allows intra-subnet
   connectivity in an IP/MPLS and/or an NVO-based network. In some
   networks, there is also a need for a dynamic and efficient inter-
   subnet connectivity across Tenant Systems and End Devices that can be
   physical or virtual and do not necessarily participate in dynamic
   routing protocols. This document defines a new EVPN route type for
   the advertisement of IP Prefixes and explains some use-case examples
   where this new route-type is used.

      to a BT. In order to simplify the explanation, this document
      assumes a single BT and subnet per MAC-VRF. If the EVI consisted
      of multiple BDs (a subnet per BD) using inter-subnet-forwarding,
      each BT in the MAC-VRF would need a separate IRB. The same
      procedures would apply.


2. Introduction and problem statement

   Inter-subnet connectivity is used for certain tenants within the Data
   Center. [EVPN-INTERSUBNET] defines some fairly common inter-subnet
   forwarding scenarios where TSes can exchange packets with TSes
   located in remote subnets. In order to achieve this,
   [EVPN-INTERSUBNET] describes how MAC/IPs encoded in TS RT-2 routes
   are not only used to populate MAC-VRF and overlay ARP tables, but
   also IP-VRF tables with the encoded TS host routes (/32 or /128). In
   some cases, EVPN may advertise IP Prefixes and therefore provide
   aggregation in the IP-VRF tables, as opposed to program individual
   host routes. This document complements the scenarios described in
   [EVPN-INTERSUBNET] and defines how EVPN may be used to advertise IP
   Prefixes. Interoperability between EVPN and L3VPN [RFC4364] IP Prefix
   routes is out of the scope of this document.  

   Section 2.1 describes the inter-subnet connectivity requirements in
   Data Centers. Section 2.2 explains why a new EVPN route type is
   required for IP Prefix advertisements. Once the need for a new EVPN
   route type is justified, sections 3, 4 and 5 will describe this route
   type and how it is used in some specific use cases.  

2.1 Inter-subnet connectivity requirements in Data Centers

   [RFC7432] is used as the control plane for a Network Virtualization
   Overlay (NVO3) solution in Data Centers (DC), where Network
   Virtualization Edge (NVE) devices can be located in Hypervisors or
   TORs, as described in [EVPN-OVERLAY].

   If we use the term Tenant System (TS) to designate a physical or
   virtual system identified by MAC and IP addresses, and connected to a
   MAC-VRF by an Attachment Circuit, the following considerations apply:

   o The Tenant Systems may be Virtual Machines (VMs) that generate
     traffic from their own MAC and IP.

   o The Tenant Systems may be Virtual Appliance entities (VAs) that
     forward traffic to/from IP addresses of different End Devices
     sitting behind them.

        o These VAs can be firewalls, load balancers, NAT devices, other
 


Rabadan et al.          Expires January 19, 2018                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft         EVPN Prefix Advertisement           July 18, 2017


          appliances or virtual gateways with virtual routing instances.

        o These VAs do not necessarily participate in dynamic routing
          protocols and hence rely on the EVPN NVEs to advertise the
          routes on their behalf.

        o In all these cases, the VA will forward traffic to other TSes
          using its own source MAC but the source IP will be the one
          associated to the End Device sitting behind or a translated IP
          address (part of a public NAT pool) if the VA is performing
          NAT.

        o Note that the same IP address could exist behind two of these
          TS. One example of this would be certain appliance resiliency
          mechanisms, where a virtual IP or floating IP can be owned by
          one of the two VAs running the resiliency protocol (the master
          VA). Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), RFC5798, is
          one particular example of this. Another example is multi-homed
          subnets, i.e. the same subnet is connected to two VAs.

        o Although these VAs provide IP connectivity to VMs and subnets
          behind them, they do not always have their own IP interface
          connected to the EVPN NVE, e.g. layer-2 firewalls are examples
          of VAs not supporting IP interfaces.

   Figure 1 illustrates some of the examples described above.

   Where:

   NVE1, NVE2, NVE3, NVE4, NVE5, DGW1 and DGW2 share the same EVI for a
   particular tenant. EVI-10 is comprised of the collection of MAC-VRF10
   instances defined in all the NVEs. All the hosts connected to EVI-10
   belong to the same IP subnet. The hosts connected to EVI-10 are
   listed below:

   o TS1 is a VM that generates/receives traffic from/to IP1, where IP1
     belongs to the EVI-10 subnet.

   o TS2 and TS3 are Virtual Appliances (VA) that generate/receive
     traffic from/to the subnets and hosts sitting behind them (SN1,
     SN2, SN3, IP4 and IP5). Their IP addresses (IP2 and IP3) belong to
     the EVI-10 subnet and they can also generate/receive traffic. When
     these VAs receive packets destined to their own MAC addresses (M2
     and M3) they will route the packets to the proper subnet or host.

Internet-Draft         EVPN Prefix Advertisement           July 18, 2017


     These VAs do not support routing protocols to advertise the subnets
     connected to them and can move to a different server and NVE when
     the Cloud Management System decides to do so. These VAs may also
     support redundancy mechanisms for some subnets, similar to VRRP,
     where a floating IP is owned by the master VA and only the master
     VA forwards traffic to a given subnet. E.g.: vIP23 in figure 1 is a
     floating IP that can be owned by TS2 or TS3 depending on who the
     master is. Only the master will forward traffic to SN1.  

   o Integrated Routing and Bridging interfaces IRB1, IRB2 and IRB3 have
     their own IP addresses that belong to the EVI-10 subnet too. These
     IRB interfaces connect the EVI-10 subnet to Virtual Routing and
     Forwarding (IP-VRF) instances that can route the traffic to other
     connected subnets for the same tenant (within the DC or at the
     other end of the WAN).

   o TS4 is a layer-2 VA that provides connectivity to subnets SN5, SN6
     and SN7, but does not have an IP address itself in the EVI-10. TS4
     is connected to a physical port on NVE5 assigned to Ethernet
     Segment Identifier 4.

   All the above DC use cases require inter-subnet forwarding and
   therefore the individual host routes and subnets: 

   a) MUST be advertised from the NVEs (since VAs and VMs do not
      participate in dynamic routing protocols) and
   b) MAY be associated to an Overlay Index that can be a VA IP address,
      a floating IP address, a MAC address or an ESI. An Overlay Index
      is a next-hop that requires a recursive resolution and it is
      described in section 3.2.  


2.2 The requirement for a new EVPN route type   

   [RFC7432] defines a MAC/IP route (also referred as RT-2) where a MAC
   address can be advertised together with an IP address length (IPL)
   and IP address (IP). While a variable IPL might have been used to
   indicate the presence of an IP prefix in a route type 2, there are
   several specific use cases in which using this route type to deliver
   IP Prefixes is not suitable.

   One example of such use cases is the "floating IP" example described
   in section 2.1. In this example we need to decouple the advertisement
   of the prefixes from the advertisement of the floating IP (vIP23 in
   Figure 1) and MAC associated to it, otherwise the solution gets
   highly inefficient and does not scale. 

   E.g.: if we are advertising 1k prefixes from M2 (using RT-2) and the
 


Rabadan et al.          Expires January 19, 2018                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft         EVPN Prefix Advertisement           July 18, 2017


   floating IP owner changes from M2 to M3, we would need to withdraw 1k
   routes from M2 and re-advertise 1k routes from M3. However if we use
   a separate route type, we can advertise the 1k routes associated to
   the floating IP address (vIP23) and only one RT-2 for advertising the
   ownership of the floating IP, i.e. vIP23 and M2 in the route type 2.
   When the floating IP owner changes from M2 to M3, a single RT-2
   withdraw/update is required to indicate the change. The remote DGW
   will not change any of the 1k prefixes associated to vIP23, but will
   only update the ARP resolution entry for vIP23 (now pointing at M3).

   Other reasons to decouple the IP Prefix advertisement from the MAC/IP
   route are listed below:

   o Clean identification, operation and troubleshooting of IP Prefixes,
     independent of and not subject to the interpretation of the IPL and
     the IP value. E.g.: a default IP route 0.0.0.0/0 must always be
     easily and clearly distinguished from the absence of IP
     information.

   o In MAC/IP routes, the MAC information is part of the NLRI, so if IP
     Prefixes were to be advertised using MAC/IP routes, the MAC
     information would always be present and part of the route key. 

   The following sections describe how EVPN is extended with a new route
   type for the advertisement of IP prefixes and how this route is used
   to address the current and future inter-subnet connectivity
   requirements existing in the Data Center.


3. The BGP EVPN IP Prefix route

   The current BGP EVPN NLRI as defined in [RFC7432] is shown below:

    +-----------------------------------+
    |    Route Type (1 octet)           |
    +-----------------------------------+
    |     Length (1 octet)              |
    +-----------------------------------+
    | Route Type specific (variable)    |
    +-----------------------------------+

   Where the route type field can contain one of the following specific
   values (refer to the IANA "EVPN Route Types registry):

   + 1 - Ethernet Auto-Discovery (A-D) route

   + 2 - MAC/IP advertisement route

Internet-Draft         EVPN Prefix Advertisement           July 18, 2017


   + 3 - Inclusive Multicast Route

   + 4 - Ethernet Segment Route

   This document defines an additional route type that IANA has added to
   the registry, and will be used for the advertisement of IP Prefixes:

   + 5 - IP Prefix Route

   The support for this new route type is OPTIONAL. 

   Since this new route type is OPTIONAL, an implementation not
   supporting it MUST ignore the route, based on the unknown route type
   value, as specified by Section 5.4 in [RFC7606]. 

   The detailed encoding of this route and associated procedures are
   described in the following sections.


3.1 IP Prefix Route encoding

   An IP Prefix advertisement route NLRI consists of the following
   fields:

    +---------------------------------------+
    |      RD   (8 octets)                  |
    +---------------------------------------+
    |Ethernet Segment Identifier (10 octets)|
    +---------------------------------------+
    |  Ethernet Tag ID (4 octets)           |
    +---------------------------------------+
    |  IP Prefix Length (1 octet)           |
    +---------------------------------------+
    |  IP Prefix (4 or 16 octets)           |

     identifier if the ESI is used as an Overlay Index (see the
     definition of Overlay Index in section 3.2). It will be zero

     otherwise.

   o The IP Prefix Length can be set to a value between 0 and 32 (bits)
     for ipv4 and between 0 and 128 for ipv6, and specifies the number
     of bits in the Prefix.

   o The IP Prefix will be a 32 or 128-bit field (ipv4 or ipv6). The
     size of this field does not depend on the value of the IP Prefix
     Length field.

   o The GW IP (Gateway IP Address) will be a 32 or 128-bit field (ipv4
     or ipv6), and will encode an overlay IP index for the IP Prefixes.
     The GW IP field SHOULD be zero if it is not used as an Overlay
     Index. Refer to section 3.2 for the definition and use of the
     Overlay Index.

   o The MPLS Label field is encoded as 3 octets, where the high-order
     20 bits contain the label value. When sending, the label value
     SHOULD be zero to indicate that recursive resolution is needed. If
     the received MPLS Label value is zero, the route MUST contain an
     Overlay Index and the ingress NVE/PE MUST do recursive resolution
     to find the egress NVE/PE. If the received Label value is non-zero,
     the route will not be used for recursive resolution unless a local
     policy says so. 

   o The total route length will indicate the type of prefix (ipv4 or
     ipv6) and the type of GW IP address (ipv4 or ipv6). Note that the
     IP Prefix + the GW IP should have a length of either 64 or 256
     bits, but never 160 bits (ipv4 and ipv6 mixed values are not
     allowed).

   The RD, Eth-Tag ID, IP Prefix Length and IP Prefix will be part of
   the route key used by BGP to compare routes. The rest of the fields
   will not be part of the route key.


3.2 Overlay Indexes and Recursive Lookup Resolution

   RT-5 routes support recursive lookup resolution through the use of
   Overlay Indexes as follows: 

   o An Overlay Index can be an ESI, IP address in the address space of
     the tenant or MAC address and it is used by an NVE as the next-hop
     for a given IP Prefix. An Overlay Index always needs a recursive
     route resolution on the NVE/PE that installs the RT-5 into one of
     its IP-VRFs, so that the NVE knows to which egress NVE/PE it needs
     to forward the packets. It is important to note that recursive
     resolution of the Overlay Index applies upon installation into an
 


Rabadan et al.          Expires January 19, 2018               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft         EVPN Prefix Advertisement           July 18, 2017


     IP-VRF, and not upon BGP propagation. Also, as a result of the
     recursive resolution, the egress NVE/PE is not necessarily the same
     NVE that originated the RT-5.

   o The Overlay Index is indicated along with the RT-5 in the ESI
     field, GW IP field or Router's MAC Extended Community, depending on
     whether the IP Prefix next-hop is an ESI, IP address or MAC address
     in the tenant space. The Overlay Index for a given IP Prefix is set
     by local policy at the NVE that originates an RT-5 for that IP
     Prefix (typically managed by the Cloud Management System).   

   o In order to enable the recursive lookup resolution at the ingress
     NVE, an NVE that is a possible egress NVE for a given Overlay Index
     must originate a route advertising itself as the BGP next hop on
     the path to the system denoted by the Overlay Index. For instance: 

     . If an NVE receives an RT-5 that specifies an Overlay Index, the
       NVE cannot use the RT-5 in its IP-VRF unless (or until) it can
       recursively resolve the Overlay Index. 
     . If the RT-5 specifies an ESI as the Overlay Index, recursive
       resolution can only be done if the NVE has received and installed
       an RT-1 (Auto-Discovery per-EVI) route specifying that ESI. 
     . If the RT-5 specifies a GW IP address as the Overlay Index,
       recursive resolution can only be done if the NVE has received and
       installed an RT-2 (MAC/IP route) specifying that IP address in
       the IP address field of its NLRI. 
     . If the RT-5 specifies a MAC address as the Overlay Index,
       recursive resolution can only be done if the NVE has received and
       installed an RT-2 (MAC/IP route) specifying that MAC address in
       the MAC address field of its NLRI.

     Note that the RT-1 or RT-2 routes needed for the recursive
     resolution may arrive before or after the given RT-5 route.

   o Irrespective of the recursive resolution, if there is no IGP or BGP
     route to the BGP next-hop of an RT-5, BGP may fail to install the
     RT-5 even if the Overlay Index can be resolved.

   o The ESI and GW IP fields MAY both be zero, however they MUST NOT
     both be non-zero at the same time. A route containing a non-zero GW
     IP and a non-zero ESI (at the same time) will be treated as-
     withdraw.

   The indirection provided by the Overlay Index and its recursive
   lookup resolution is required to achieve fast convergence in case of
   a failure of the object represented by the Overlay Index. For
   instance: in Figure 1, let's assume NVE2/NVE3 advertise 1k RT-5
   routes associated to the floating IP address (GWIP=vIP23) and NVE2
 


Rabadan et al.          Expires January 19, 2018               [Page 11]

   advertises an RT-2 claiming the ownership of the floating IP, i.e.
   NVE2 encodes vIP23 and M2 in the RT-2. When the floating IP owner
   changes from M2 to M3, a single RT-2 withdraw/update is required to
   indicate the change. The remote DGW will not change any of the 1k
   prefixes associated to vIP23, but will only update the ARP resolution
   entry for vIP23 (now pointing at M3).

   Table 1 shows the different RT-5 field combinations allowed by this
   specification and what Overlay Index must be used by the receiving
   NVE/PE in each case. When the Overlay Index is "None" in Table 1, the
   receiving NVE/PE will not perform any recursive resolution, and the
   actual next-hop is given by the RT-5's BGP next-hop.

   *   MAC with Zero value means no Router's MAC extended community is
       present along with the RT-5. Non-Zero indicates that the extended
       community is present and carries a valid MAC address. Examples of
       invalid MAC addresses are broadcast or multicast MAC addresses. 

   **  In this case, the Overlay Index may be the RT-5's MAC address or
       None, depending on the local policy of the receiving NVE/PE.

   *** The Overlay Index is None. This is a special case used for IP-
       VRF-to-IP-VRF where the NVE/PEs are connected by IP NVO tunnels
       as opposed to Ethernet NVO tunnels.

   This section describes some use-cases for the Overlay Index types.

   forwarding for subnets sitting behind Virtual Appliances (on TS2 and
   TS3).

   IP5---+                                     +-------------+

                  Figure 2 TS IP address use-case

   An example of inter-subnet forwarding between subnet SN1/24 and a
   subnet sitting in the WAN is described below. NVE2, NVE3, DGW1 and
   DGW2 are running BGP EVPN. TS2 and TS3 do not participate in dynamic
   routing protocols, and they only have a static route to forward the

Internet-Draft         EVPN Prefix Advertisement           July 18, 2017


   traffic to the WAN. 

   In this case, a GW IP is used as an Overlay Index. Although a
   different Overlay Index type could have been used, this use-case
   assumes that the operator knows the VA's IP addresses beforehand,
   whereas the VA's MAC address is unknown and the VA's ESI is zero.
   Because of this, the GW IP is the suitable Overlay Index to be used
   with the RT-5s. The NVEs know the GW IP to be used for a given Prefix
   by policy.  

   (1) NVE2 advertises the following BGP routes on behalf of TS2:

        o Route type 2 (MAC/IP route) containing: ML=48, M=M2, IPL=32,
          IP=IP2 and [RFC5512] BGP Encapsulation Extended Community with
          the corresponding Tunnel-type. The MAC and IP addresses may be
          learned via ARP-snooping (ND-snooping if IPv6). 

        o Route type 5 (IP Prefix route) containing: IPL=24, IP=SN1,
          ESI=0, GW IP address=IP2. The prefix and GW IP are learned by
          policy.

   (2) Similarly, NVE3 advertises the following BGP routes on behalf of
       TS3:

        o Route type 2 (MAC/IP route) containing: ML=48, M=M3, IPL=32,
          IP=IP3 (and BGP Encapsulation Extended Community).

        o Route type 5 (IP Prefix route) containing: IPL=24, IP=SN1,
          ESI=0, GW IP address=IP3.

   (3) DGW1 and DGW2 import both received routes based on the
       route-targets:

        o Based on the MAC-VRF10 route-target in DGW1 and DGW2, the
          MAC/IP route is imported and M2 is added to the MAC-VRF10
          along with its corresponding tunnel information. For instance,
          if VXLAN is used, the VTEP will be derived from the MAC/IP
          route BGP next-hop and VNI from the MPLS Label1 field. IP2 -
          M2 is added to the ARP table. Similarly, M3 is added to MAC-
          VRF10 and IP3 - M3 to the ARP table.

        o Based on the MAC-VRF10 route-target in DGW1 and DGW2, the IP
          Prefix route is also imported and SN1/24 is added to the IP-
          VRF with Overlay Index IP2 pointing at the local MAC-VRF10. We
          assume the RT-5 from NVE2 is preferred over the RT-5 from
          NVE3. Should ECMP be enabled in the IP-VRF and both routes
          equally preferable, SN1/24 would also be added to the routing
          table with Overlay Index IP3.

Internet-Draft         EVPN Prefix Advertisement           July 18, 2017


   (4) When DGW1 receives a packet from the WAN with destination IPx,
       where IPx belongs to SN1/24:

        o A destination IP lookup is performed on the DGW1 IP-VRF
          routing table and Overlay Index=IP2 is found. Since IP2 is an
          Overlay Index a recursive route resolution is required for
          IP2.

        o IP2 is resolved to M2 in the ARP table, and M2 is resolved to
          the tunnel information given by the MAC-VRF FIB (e.g. remote
          VTEP and VNI for the VXLAN case).

        o The IP packet destined to IPx is encapsulated with:

             . Source inner MAC = IRB1 MAC.

             . Destination inner MAC = M2.

             . Tunnel information provided by the MAC-VRF (VNI, VTEP IPs
               and MACs for the VXLAN case).

   (5) When the packet arrives at NVE2:

        o Based on the tunnel information (VNI for the VXLAN case), the
          MAC-VRF10 context is identified for a MAC lookup.

        o Encapsulation is stripped-off and based on a MAC lookup
          (assuming MAC forwarding on the egress NVE), the packet is
          forwarded to TS2, where it will be properly routed.

   (6) Should TS2 move from NVE2 to NVE3, MAC Mobility procedures will
       be applied to the MAC route IP2/M2, as defined in [RFC7432].
       Route type 5 prefixes are not subject to MAC mobility procedures,
       hence no changes in the DGW IP-VRF routing table will occur for
       TS2 mobility, i.e. all the prefixes will still be pointing at IP2
       as Overlay Index. There is an indirection for e.g. SN1/24, which
       still points at Overlay Index IP2 in the routing table, but IP2
       will be simply resolved to a different tunnel, based on the
       outcome of the MAC mobility procedures for the MAC/IP route
       IP2/M2.

   Note that in the opposite direction, TS2 will send traffic based on
   its static-route next-hop information (IRB1 and/or IRB2), and regular
   EVPN procedures will be applied.

4.2 Floating IP Overlay Index use-case 

   Sometimes Tenant Systems (TS) work in active/standby mode where an

   Overlay Index to get to some subnets behind. This redundancy mode,

            Figure 3 Floating IP Overlay Index for redundant TS

   In this use-case, a GW IP is used as an Overlay Index for the same
   reasons as in 4.1. However, this GW IP is a floating IP that belongs
   to the active TS. Assuming TS2 is the active TS and owns IP23:

   (1) NVE2 advertises the following BGP routes for TS2:

        o Route type 2 (MAC/IP route) containing: ML=48, M=M2, IPL=32,
          IP=IP23 (and BGP Encapsulation Extended Community). The MAC
          and IP addresses may be learned via ARP-snooping.

        o Route type 5 (IP Prefix route) containing: IPL=24, IP=SN1,
          ESI=0, GW IP address=IP23. The prefix and GW IP are learned by
          policy.

   (2) NVE3 advertises the following BGP route for TS3 (it does not
       advertise an RT-2 for IP23/M3):

        o Route type 5 (IP Prefix route) containing: IPL=24, IP=SN1,
          ESI=0, GW IP address=IP23. The prefix and GW IP are learned by
          policy.

   (3) DGW1 and DGW2 import both received routes based on the route-
       target:

        o M2 is added to the MAC-VRF10 FIB along with its corresponding
          tunnel information. For the VXLAN use case, the VTEP will be
          derived from the MAC/IP route BGP next-hop and VNI from the

          VNI/VSID field. IP23 - M2 is added to the ARP table.

        o SN1/24 is added to the IP-VRF in DGW1 and DGW2 with Overlay
          index IP23 pointing at M2 in the local MAC-VRF10.

   (4) When DGW1 receives a packet from the WAN with destination IPx,
       where IPx belongs to SN1/24:

        o A destination IP lookup is performed on the DGW1 IP-VRF
          routing table and Overlay Index=IP23 is found. Since IP23 is
          an Overlay Index, a recursive route resolution for IP23 is
          required.

        o IP23 is resolved to M2 in the ARP table, and M2 is resolved to
          the tunnel information given by the MAC-VRF (remote VTEP and
          VNI for the VXLAN case).

        o The IP packet destined to IPx is encapsulated with:

             . Source inner MAC = IRB1 MAC.

             . Destination inner MAC = M2.

             . Tunnel information provided by the MAC-VRF FIB (VNI, VTEP
               IPs and MACs for the VXLAN case).

   (5) When the packet arrives at NVE2:

        o Based on the tunnel information (VNI for the VXLAN case), the
          MAC-VRF10 context is identified for a MAC lookup.

        o Encapsulation is stripped-off and based on a MAC lookup
          (assuming MAC forwarding on the egress NVE), the packet is
          forwarded to TS2, where it will be properly routed.

   (6) When the redundancy protocol running between TS2 and TS3 appoints
       TS3 as the new active TS for SN1, TS3 will now own the floating
       IP23 and will signal this new ownership (GARP message or
       similar). Upon receiving the new owner's notification, NVE3 will
       issue a route type 2 for M3-IP23 and NVE2 will withdraw the RT-2
       for M2-IP23. DGW1 and DGW2 will update their ARP tables with the
       new MAC resolving the floating IP. No changes are made in the IP-
       VRF routing table.

   Prefix route that carries a subnet SN1. In this use-case, TS2 and TS3
   are layer-2 VA devices without any IP address that can be included as
   an Overlay Index in the GW IP field of the IP Prefix route. Their MAC
   addresses are M2 and M3 respectively and are connected to EVI-10.
   Note that IRB1 and IRB2 (in DGW1 and DGW2 respectively) have IP
   addresses in a subnet different than SN1.

                    Figure 5 Bump-in-the-wire use-case

   Since neither TS2 nor TS3 can participate in any dynamic routing
   protocol and have no IP address assigned, there are two potential
   Overlay Index types that can be used when advertising SN1: 

   a) an ESI, i.e. ESI23, that can be provisioned on the attachment
      ports of NVE2 and NVE3, as shown in Figure 5. 
   b) or the VA's MAC address, that can be added to NVE2 and NVE3 by
      policy.

   The advantage of using an ESI as Overlay Index as opposed to the VA's
   MAC address, is that the forwarding to the egress NVE can be done
   purely based on the state of the AC in the ES (notified by the AD
   per-EVI route) and all the EVPN multi-homing redundancy mechanisms
   can be re-used. For instance, the [RFC7432] mass-withdrawal mechanism
   for fast failure detection and propagation can be used. This section
   assumes that an ESI Overlay Index is used in this use-case but it
   does not prevent the use of the VA's MAC address as an Overlay Index.
   If a MAC is used as Overlay Index, the control plane must follow the
   procedures described in section 4.4.3. 

   The model supports VA redundancy in a similar way as the one
   described in section 4.2 for the floating IP Overlay Index use-case,
   except that it uses the EVPN Ethernet A-D per-EVI route instead of
   the MAC advertisement route to advertise the location of the Overlay

   Index. The procedure is explained below:

   (1) Assuming TS2 is the active TS in ESI23, NVE2 advertises the
   following BGP routes:

        o Route type 1 (Ethernet A-D route for EVI-10) containing:
          ESI=ESI23 and the corresponding tunnel information (VNI/VSID
          field), as well as the BGP Encapsulation Extended Community as
          per [EVPN-OVERLAY]. 

        o Route type 5 (IP Prefix route) containing: IPL=24, IP=SN1,
          ESI=ESI23, GW IP address=0. The Router's MAC Extended
          Community defined in [EVPN-INTERSUBNET] is added and carries
          the MAC address (M2) associated to the TS behind which SN1
          sits. M2 may be learned by policy. 

   (2) NVE3 advertises the following BGP route for TS3 (no AD per-EVI
          route is advertised): 

        o Route type 5 (IP Prefix route) containing: IPL=24, IP=SN1,
          ESI=23, GW IP address=0. The Router's MAC Extended Community
          is added and carries the MAC address (M3) associated to the TS
          behind which SN1 sits. M3 may be learned by policy.

   (3) DGW1 and DGW2 import the received routes based on the route-
       target:

        o The tunnel information to get to ESI23 is installed in DGW1
          and DGW2. For the VXLAN use case, the VTEP will be derived
          from the Ethernet A-D route BGP next-hop and VNI from the
          VNI/VSID field (see [EVPN-OVERLAY]). 

        o The RT-5 coming from the NVE that advertised the RT-1 is
          selected and SN1/24 is added to the IP-VRF in DGW1 and DGW2
          with Overlay Index ESI23 and MAC = M2.

   (4) When DGW1 receives a packet from the WAN with destination IPx,
       where IPx belongs to SN1/24:

        o A destination IP lookup is performed on the DGW1 IP-VRF
          routing table and Overlay Index=ESI23 is found. Since ESI23 is
          an Overlay Index, a recursive route resolution is required to
          find the egress NVE where ESI23 resides.

        o The IP packet destined to IPx is encapsulated with:

             . Source inner MAC = IRB1 MAC.

 


Rabadan et al.          Expires January 19, 2018               [Page 19]

Internet-Draft         EVPN Prefix Advertisement           July 18, 2017


             . Destination inner MAC = M2 (this MAC will be obtained
               from the Router's MAC Extended Community received along
               with the RT-5 for SN1).

             . Tunnel information for the NVO tunnel is provided by the
               Ethernet A-D route per-EVI for ESI23 (VNI and VTEP IP for
               the VXLAN case).

   (5) When the packet arrives at NVE2:

        o Based on the tunnel demultiplexer information (VNI for the
          VXLAN case), the MAC-VRF10 context is identified for a MAC
          lookup (assuming MAC disposition model) or the VNI MAY
          directly identify the egress interface (for a label or VNI
          disposition model).

        o Encapsulation is stripped-off and based on a MAC lookup
          (assuming MAC forwarding on the egress NVE) or a VNI lookup
          (in case of VNI forwarding), the packet is forwarded to TS2,
          where it will be forwarded to SN1.

   (6) If the redundancy protocol running between TS2 and TS3 follows an
       active/standby model and there is a failure, appointing TS3 as
       the new active TS for SN1, TS3 will now own the connectivity to
       SN1 and will signal this new ownership. Upon receiving the new
       owner's notification, NVE3's AC will become active and issue a
       route type 1 for ESI23, whereas NVE2 will withdraw its Ethernet
       A-D route for ESI23. DGW1 and DGW2 will update their tunnel
       information to resolve ESI23. The destination inner MAC will be
       changed to M3.

4.4 IP-VRF-to-IP-VRF model

   This use-case is similar to the scenario described in "IRB forwarding
   on NVEs for Tenant Systems" in [EVPN-INTERSUBNET], however the new
   requirement here is the advertisement of IP Prefixes as opposed to
   only host routes. 

   In the examples described in sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, the MAC-VRF
   instance can connect IRB interfaces and any other Tenant Systems
   connected to it. EVPN provides connectivity for:

   1. Traffic destined to the IRB or TS IP interfaces as well as

   2. Traffic destined to IP subnets sitting behind the TS, e.g. SN1 or
      SN2.

   In order to provide connectivity for (1), MAC/IP routes (RT-2) are
 


Rabadan et al.          Expires January 19, 2018               [Page 20]

Internet-Draft         EVPN Prefix Advertisement           July 18, 2017


   needed so that IRB or TS MACs and IPs can be distributed.
   Connectivity type (2) is accomplished by the exchange of IP Prefix
   routes (RT-5) for IPs and subnets sitting behind certain Overlay
   Indexes, e.g. GW IP or ESI.

   In some cases, IP Prefix routes may be advertised for subnets and IPs
   sitting behind an IRB. We refer to this use-case as the "IP-VRF-to-
   IP-VRF" model. 

   [EVPN-INTERSUBNET] defines an asymmetric IRB model and a symmetric
   IRB model, based on the required lookups at the ingress and egress
   NVE: the asymmetric model requires an ip-lookup and a mac-lookup at
   the ingress NVE, whereas only a mac-lookup is needed at the egress
   NVE; the symmetric model requires ip and mac lookups at both, ingress
   and egress NVE. From that perspective, the IP-VRF-to-IP-VRF use-case
   described in this section is a symmetric IRB model. 

   Note that, in an IP-VRF-to-IP-VRF scenario, out of the many subnets
   that a tenant may have, it may be the case that only a few are
   attached to a given NVE/PE's IP-VRF. In order to provide inter-subnet
   connectivity among the set of NVE/PEs where the tenant is connected,
   a new inter-subnet or core EVI is created on all of them. This core
   EVI is instantiated as a core MAC-VRF in each NVE/PE and has a core-
   facing IRB interface that connects the core MAC-VRF to the IP-VRF. If
   no recursive resolution is needed, the core EVI may not be needed and
   the IP-VRFs may be connected directly by Ethernet or IP NVO tunnels.
   Depending on the existence and characteristics of the core-facing IRB
   interface in the core EVI, there are three different IP-VRF-to-IP-VRF
   scenarios identified and described in this document:

   1) Interface-less model
   2) Interface-ful with core-facing IRB model
   3) Interface-ful with unnumbered core-facing IRB model

   Inter-subnet IP multicast is outside the scope of this document.

         Figure 6 Interface-less IP-VRF-to-IP-VRF model

   In this case:

   a) The NVEs and DGWs must provide connectivity between hosts in SN1,
      SN2, IP1 and hosts sitting at the other end of the WAN, for
      example, H1. We assume the DGWs import/export IP and/or VPN-IP
      routes from/to the WAN.

   b) The IP-VRF instances in the NVE/DGWs are directly connected
      through NVO tunnels, and no IRBs and/or MAC-VRF instances are
      instantiated to connect the IP-VRFs.

   c) The solution must provide layer-3 connectivity among the IP-VRFs
      for Ethernet NVO tunnels, for instance, VXLAN or nvGRE.

   d) The solution may provide layer-3 connectivity among the IP-VRFs
      for IP NVO tunnels, for example, VXLAN GPE (with IP payload).

   In order to meet the above requirements, the EVPN route type 5 will
   be used to advertise the IP Prefixes, along with the Router's MAC
   Extended Community as defined in [EVPN-INTERSUBNET] if the
   advertising NVE/DGW uses Ethernet NVO tunnels. Each NVE/DGW will
   advertise an RT-5 for each of its prefixes with the following fields:

        o RD as per [RFC7432].

Internet-Draft         EVPN Prefix Advertisement           July 18, 2017


        o Eth-Tag ID=0.

        o IP address length and IP address, as explained in the previous
          sections.

        o GW IP address=0.

        o ESI=0

        o MPLS label or VNI corresponding to the IP-VRF.

   Each RT-5 will be sent with a route-target identifying the tenant
   (IP-VRF) and two BGP extended communities:

        o The first one is the BGP Encapsulation Extended Community, as
          per [RFC5512], identifying the tunnel type.

        o The second one is the Router's MAC Extended Community as per
          [EVPN-INTERSUBNET] containing the MAC address associated to
          the NVE advertising the route. This MAC address identifies the
          NVE/DGW and MAY be re-used for all the IP-VRFs in the NVE. The
          Router's MAC Extended Community MUST be sent if the route is
          associated to an Ethernet NVO tunnel, for instance, VXLAN. If
          the route is associated to an IP NVO tunnel, for instance
          VXLAN GPE with IP payload, the Router's MAC Extended Community
          SHOULD NOT be sent.

   The following example illustrates the procedure to advertise and
   forward packets to SN1/24 (ipv4 prefix advertised from NVE1):

   (1) NVE1 advertises the following BGP route:

        o Route type 5 (IP Prefix route) containing:

          . IPL=24, IP=SN1, Label=10.

          . GW IP= SHOULD be set to 0.

          . [RFC5512] BGP Encapsulation Extended Community.

          . Router's MAC Extended Community that contains M1.

          . Route-target identifying the tenant (IP-VRF).

   (2) DGW1 imports the received routes from NVE1:

        o DGW1 installs SN1/24 in the IP-VRF identified by the RT-5
          route-target.

Internet-Draft         EVPN Prefix Advertisement           July 18, 2017


        o Since GW IP=ESI=0, the Label is a non-zero value and the local
          policy indicates this interface-less model, DGW1 will use the
          Label and next-hop of the RT-5, as well as the MAC address
          conveyed in the Router's MAC Extended Community (as inner
          destination MAC address) to set up the forwarding state and
          later encapsulate the routed IP packets.

   (3) When DGW1 receives a packet from the WAN with destination IPx,
       where IPx belongs to SN1/24:

        o A destination IP lookup is performed on the DGW1 IP-VRF
          routing table. The lookup yields SN1/24.

        o Since the RT-5 for SN1/24 had a GW IP=ESI=0, a non-zero Label
          and next-hop and the model is interface-less, DGW1 will not
          need a recursive lookup to resolve the route.

        o The IP packet destined to IPx is encapsulated with: Source
          inner MAC = DGW1 MAC, Destination inner MAC = M1, Source outer
          IP (tunnel source IP) = DGW1 IP, Destination outer IP (tunnel
          destination IP) = NVE1 IP. The Source and Destination inner
          MAC addresses are not needed if IP NVO tunnels are used.

   (4) When the packet arrives at NVE1:

        o NVE1 will identify the IP-VRF for an IP-lookup based on the
          Label (the Destination inner MAC is not needed to identify the
          IP-VRF).

        o An IP lookup is performed in the routing context, where SN1
          turns out to be a local subnet associated to MAC-VRF2. A
          subsequent lookup in the ARP table and the MAC-VRF FIB will
          provide the forwarding information for the packet in MAC-VRF2.

   The model described above is called Interface-less model since the
   IP-VRFs are connected directly through tunnels and they don't require
   those tunnels to be terminated in core MAC-VRFs instead, like in
   sections 4.4.2 or 4.4.3. An EVPN IP-VRF-to-IP-VRF implementation is
   REQUIRED to support the ingress and egress procedures described in
   this section.

         Figure 7 Interface-ful with core-facing IRB model

   In this model: 

   a) As in section 4.4.1, the NVEs and DGWs must provide connectivity
      between hosts in SN1, SN2, IP1 and hosts sitting at the other end
      of the WAN.

   b) However, the NVE/DGWs are now connected through Ethernet NVO
      tunnels terminated in core-MAC-VRF instances. The IP-VRFs use IRB
      interfaces for their connectivity to the core MAC-VRFs.

   c) Each core-facing IRB has an IP and a MAC address, where the IP
      address must be reachable from other NVEs or DGWs. 

   d) The core EVI is composed of the NVE/DGW MAC-VRFs and may contain
      other MAC-VRFs without IRB interfaces. Those non-IRB MAC-VRFs will
      typically connect TSes that need layer-3 connectivity to remote
      subnets.

   e) The solution must provide layer-3 connectivity for Ethernet NVO
      tunnels, for instance, VXLAN or nvGRE.

   EVPN type 5 routes will be used to advertise the IP Prefixes, whereas
   EVPN RT-2 routes will advertise the MAC/IP addresses of each core-
   facing IRB interface. Each NVE/DGW will advertise an RT-5 for each of
   its prefixes with the following fields:

        o RD as per [RFC7432].

        o Eth-Tag ID=0.

        o IP address length and IP address, as explained in the previous
          sections.

        o GW IP address=IRB-IP (this is the Overlay Index that will be
          used for the recursive route resolution).

        o ESI=0

        o Label value SHOULD be zero since the RT-5 route requires a
          recursive lookup resolution to an RT-2 route. The MPLS label
          or VNI to be used when forwarding packets will be derived from
          the RT-2's MPLS Label1 field. The RT-5's Label field will be
          ignored on reception.

   Each RT-5 will be sent with a route-target identifying the tenant
   (IP-VRF). The Router's MAC Extended Community SHOULD NOT be sent in
   this case.

   The following example illustrates the procedure to advertise and
   forward packets to SN1/24 (ipv4 prefix advertised from NVE1):

   (1) NVE1 advertises the following BGP routes:

        o Route type 5 (IP Prefix route) containing:

          . IPL=24, IP=SN1, Label= SHOULD be set to 0.

          . GW IP=IP1 (core-facing IRB's IP)

          . Route-target identifying the tenant (IP-VRF).

        o Route type 2 (MAC/IP route for the core-facing IRB)
          containing:

          . ML=48, M=M1, IPL=32, IP=IP1, Label=10.

          . A [RFC5512] BGP Encapsulation Extended Community.

          . Route-target identifying the core MAC-VRF. This route-target
            MAY be the same as the one used with the RT-5.

   (2) DGW1 imports the received routes from NVE1:

        o DGW1 installs SN1/24 in the IP-VRF identified by the RT-5
          route-target.

          . Since GW IP is different from zero, the GW IP (IP1) will be
            used as the Overlay Index for the recursive route resolution
            to the RT-2 carrying IP1.

   (3) When DGW1 receives a packet from the WAN with destination IPx,
       where IPx belongs to SN1/24:

        o A destination IP lookup is performed on the DGW1 IP-VRF
          routing table. The lookup yields SN1/24, which is associated
          to the Overlay Index IP1. The forwarding information is
          derived from the RT-2 received for IP1.

        o The IP packet destined to IPx is encapsulated with: Source
          inner MAC = M3, Destination inner MAC = M1, Source outer IP
          (source VTEP) = DGW1 IP, Destination outer IP (destination
          VTEP) = NVE1 IP.

   (4) When the packet arrives at NVE1:

        o NVE1 will identify the IP-VRF for an IP-lookup based on the
          Label and the inner MAC DA.

        o An IP lookup is performed in the routing context, where SN1
          turns out to be a local subnet associated to MAC-VRF2. A
          subsequent lookup in the ARP table and the MAC-VRF FIB will
          provide the forwarding information for the packet in MAC-VRF2.

   The model described above is called 'Interface-ful with core-facing
   IRB model' since the tunnels connecting the DGWs and NVEs need to be
   terminated into the core MAC-VRFs. Those MAC-VRFs are connected to
   the IP-VRFs via core-facing IRB interfaces, and that allows the
   recursive resolution of RT-5s to GW IP addresses. An EVPN IP-VRF-to-
   IP-VRF implementation is REQUIRED to support the ingress and egress
   procedures described in this section.

4.4.3 Interface-ful IP-VRF-to-IP-VRF with unnumbered core-facing IRB

   Figure 8 will be used for the description of this model. Note that
   this model is similar to the one described in section 4.4.2, only
   without IP addresses on the core-facing IRB interfaces.

         Figure 8 Interface-ful with unnumbered core-facing IRB model

   In this model: 

   a) As in section 4.4.1 and 4.4.2, the NVEs and DGWs must provide
      connectivity between hosts in SN1, SN2, IP1 and hosts sitting at
      the other end of the WAN.

   b) As in section 4.4.2, the NVE/DGWs are connected through Ethernet
      NVO tunnels terminated in core-MAC-VRF instances. The IP-VRFs use
      IRB interfaces for their connectivity to the core MAC-VRFs.

   c) However, each core-facing IRB has a MAC address only, and no IP
      address (that is why the model refers to an 'unnumbered' core-
      facing IRB). In this model, there is no need to have IP
      reachability to the core-facing IRB interfaces themselves and
      there is a requirement to save IP addresses on those interfaces.

   d) As in section 4.4.2, the core EVI is composed of the NVE/DGW MAC-
      VRFs and may contain other MAC-VRFs. 

   e) As in section 4.4.2, the solution must provide layer-3
      connectivity for Ethernet NVO tunnels, for instance, VXLAN or
      nvGRE.

   This model will also make use of the RT-5 recursive resolution. EVPN
   type 5 routes will advertise the IP Prefixes along with the Router's
   MAC Extended Community used for the recursive lookup, whereas EVPN
   RT-2 routes will advertise the MAC addresses of each core-facing IRB

   interface (this time without an IP). 

   Each NVE/DGW will advertise an RT-5 for each of its prefixes with the
   same fields as described in 4.4.2 except for:

        o GW IP address= SHOULD be set to 0.

   Each RT-5 will be sent with a route-target identifying the tenant
   (IP-VRF) and the Router's MAC Extended Community containing the MAC
   address associated to core-facing IRB interface. This MAC address MAY
   be re-used for all the IP-VRFs in the NVE.

   The example is similar to the one in section 4.4.2:

   (1) NVE1 advertises the following BGP routes:

        o Route type 5 (IP Prefix route) containing the same values as
          in the example in section 4.4.2, except for:

          . GW IP= SHOULD be set to 0.

          . Router's MAC Extended Community containing M1 (this will be
            used for the recursive lookup to a RT-2).

        o Route type 2 (MAC route for the core-facing IRB) with the same
          values as in section 4.4.2 except for: 

          . ML=48, M=M1, IPL=0, Label=10.

   (2) DGW1 imports the received routes from NVE1:

        o DGW1 installs SN1/24 in the IP-VRF identified by the RT-5
          route-target.

          . The MAC contained in the Router's MAC Extended Community
            sent along with the RT-5 (M1) will be used as the Overlay
            Index for the recursive route resolution to the RT-2
            carrying M1.

   (3) When DGW1 receives a packet from the WAN with destination IPx,
       where IPx belongs to SN1/24:

        o A destination IP lookup is performed on the DGW1 IP-VRF
          routing table. The lookup yields SN1/24, which is associated
          to the Overlay Index M1. The forwarding information is derived
          from the RT-2 received for M1.

        o The IP packet destined to IPx is encapsulated with: Source

          inner MAC = M3, Destination inner MAC = M1, Source outer IP
          (source VTEP) = DGW1 IP, Destination outer IP (destination
          VTEP) = NVE1 IP.

   (4) When the packet arrives at NVE1:

        o NVE1 will identify the IP-VRF for an IP-lookup based on the
          Label and the inner MAC DA.

        o An IP lookup is performed in the routing context, where SN1
          turns out to be a local subnet associated to MAC-VRF2. A
          subsequent lookup in the ARP table and the MAC-VRF FIB will
          provide the forwarding information for the packet in MAC-VRF2.

   The model described above is called Interface-ful with core-facing
   IRB model (as in section 4.4.2), only this time the core-facing IRB
   does not have an IP address. This model is OPTIONAL for an EVPN IP-
   VRF-to-IP-VRF implementation.

5. Conclusions

   An EVPN route (type 5) for the advertisement of IP Prefixes is
   described in this document. This new route type has a differentiated
   role from the RT-2 route and addresses the Data Center (or NVO-based
   networks in general) inter-subnet connectivity scenarios described in
   this document. Using this new RT-5, an IP Prefix may be advertised
   along with an Overlay Index that can be a GW IP address, a MAC or an
   ESI, or without an Overlay Index, in which case the BGP next-hop will
   point at the egress NVE/ASBR/ABR and the MAC in the Router's MAC
   Extended Community will provide the inner MAC destination address to
   be used. As discussed throughout the document, the EVPN RT-2 does not
   meet the requirements for all the DC use cases, therefore this EVPN
   route type 5 is required.

   The EVPN route type 5 decouples the IP Prefix advertisements from the
   MAC/IP route advertisements in EVPN, hence:

   a) Allows the clean and clear advertisements of ipv4 or ipv6 prefixes
      in an NLRI with no MAC addresses.

   b) Since the route type is different from the MAC/IP Advertisement
      route, the current [RFC7432] procedures do not need to be
      modified.

   c) Allows a flexible implementation where the prefix can be linked to
      different types of Overlay Indexes: overlay IP address, overlay
      MAC addresses, overlay ESI, underlay BGP next-hops, etc.

   d) An EVPN implementation not requiring IP Prefixes can simply
      discard them by looking at the route type value.
