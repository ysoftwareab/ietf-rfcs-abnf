Abstract 

   RBridges are link layer (L2) devices that use routing protocols as a 
   control plane. They combine the link layer ability to allow hosts to 
   reattach without renumbering with network layer routing benefits. 
   RBridges use existing link state routing to provide higher internal

   cross-section bandwidth, faster convergence under reconfiguration, 
   and more robustness to link interruption than an equivalent set of 
   conventional bridges using existing spanning tree forwarding. They 
   are intended to apply to similar L2 network sizes as conventional 
   bridges and are intended to be backward compatible with those bridges 
   as both ingress/egress and transit. They also attempt to retain as 
   much 'plug and play' as is already available in existing bridges. 
   This document proposes the RBridge system as a solution to the TRILL 
   problem. It also defines the RBridge architecture, presents its 
   terminology, and describes its basic components and desired behavior. 
   A separate document specifies the protocols and mechanisms that 
   satisfy the architecture presented herein.

1. Introduction 

   This document describes an architecture that addresses the TRILL 
   problem and applicability statement [3]. This architecture is 
   composed of a set of devices called RBridges that coordinate together 
   inside an Ethernet link subnet to create a single, virtual device 
   composed of an overlay of tunnels using link state routing. RBridges 
   thus support increased internal bandwidth and fault tolerance, when 
   compared to conventional Ethernet bridges which forward frames via a 
   single spanning tree, while still being compatible with bridges and 
   hubs. 

   The remainder of this document outlines the architecture of RBridges 
   and describes their components and functions. Note that this document 
   is not intended to represent the only solution to the problem 
   statement, nor does it specify the protocols that instantiate this 
   architecture - or that only one such set of protocols is proscribed. 
   The former would be contained in other architecture documents and the 
   latter would be contained in separate specification documents. 

2. Background 

   The RBridge architecture is based on the system described in the 
   Infocom paper of the same name [2]. This paper describes the rbridge 
   system as a specific instance; this document abstracts the 
   architectural features only. The remainder of this section describes 
   the terminology of this document, which may differ from that of the 
   original paper. 

   [NOTE: terminology needs to be checked as being consistent 
   throughout]

2.1. Existing Terminology 

   o  802.1: IEEE Specification for Ethernet, i.e., including hubs and 
      switches. 

   o  802.1D: IEEE Specification for bridged Ethernet, including the 
      BPDUs that manage the spanning tree protocol. 

   o  Bridge: an Ethernet (L2, 802.1D) device with multiple point-to-
      point ports that receives incoming frames on a port and repeats 
      them on some or all of the other ports; bridges support both port 
      learning and BSTP. 

   o  Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU): the frame that bridges exchange 
      to coordinate their configuration; used primarily [QUESTION: 
      exclusively?] for BSTP. 

   o  Bridge Spanning Tree (BST): an Ethernet (L2, 802.1D) forwarding 
      protocol based on the topology of a spanning tree. 

   o  Bridge Spanning Tree Protocol (BSTP): an Ethernet (802.1D) 
      protocol for establishing and maintaining a single spanning tree 
      among all the bridges on a logical segment. 

   o  Frame: here refers to an Ethernet (L2) unit of transmission, 
      including the header, data, and trailer. 

   o  Hub: an Ethernet (L2, 802.1) device with multiple point-to-point 
      ports which transparently repeats frames that arrive on a port to 
      all other ports 

   o  Node: a device with an L2 address that sources and/or sinks L2 
      packets; nodes can occur outside the RBridge campus or be used as 
      transits within the campus. 

   o  Packet: here refers to an IP (L3, RFC791) unit of transmission, 
      including header and data. 

   o  Port learning: the process by which a switch or bridge determines 
      on which single outgoing port to copy an incoming frame. 

   o  Router: an IP (L3) forwarding device; RBridges cannot span 
      routers. 

   o  Segment: an Ethernet link, either a single physical link or 
      emulation thereof (e.g., via hubs) or a logical link or emulation 
      thereof (e.g., via bridges).

   o  Subnet, Ethernet: a single segment, or a set of segments 
      interconnected by an rbridge campus; in the latter case, the 
      subnet may or may not be equivalent to a single segment. 

   o  Switch: an Ethernet (L2, 802.1) device with multiple point-to-
      point ports which repeats frames that arrive on a port to all or 
      some of other ports; switches include port learning 

2.2. RBridge Terminology 

   o  Campus (RBridge Campus): a set of rbridges acting in unison 

   o  Campus Forwarding Table (CFT): the per-hop forwarding table 
      populated by the rbridge IGP based on lookups of the CTH inside 
      the outermost received L2 header, rather than that L2 header. 

   o  Campus Transit Header (CTH): a 'shim' header that encapsulates the 
      ingress L2 frame and persists throughout the transit of a campus, 
      which is further encapsulated a hop-by-hop L2 header/trailer. 

   o  Campus Transit Table (CTT): a table that maps ingress L2 
      destinations to egress RBridge addresses, used to encapsulate 
      ingress frames for transit of the campus. 

   o  Designated RBridge: the rbridge associated with ingress and egress 
      traffic to a particular Ethernet link; that rbridge is such a 
      link's 'designated rbridge'. 

   o  Edge (of a campus): describes rbridges that transit traffic from 
      outside the campus to inside, and vice-versa. 

   o  Egress rbridge: relative to traffic transiting an rbridge campus, 
      the egress rbridge is the rbridge where that external traffic is 
      decapsulated and exits the campus. 

   o  External (to a campus): describes communication on the non-rbridge 
      components of an Ethernet link subnet, notably not between 
      rbridges or between non-rbridges and rbridges. 

   o  Ingress rbridge: relative to traffic transiting an rbridge campus, 
      the ingress rbridge is the rbridge where that external traffic 
      entered the campus and was encapsulated. 

   o  Internal (to a campus): describes communication between rbridge 
      devices; this communication may traverse external devices, but is 
      still considered internal.

   o  Outside (to a campus): see External. 

   o  Rbridge: a single rbridge device which can aggregate with other 
      rbridge devices to create a campus

      LINK SUBNET IN WHICH THE RBRIDGE RESIDES?] 

3. Components 

   An RBridge campus is composed of rbridge devices; all other Ethernet 
   link subnet devices, such as bridges, hubs, and nodes, operate 
   conventionally in the presence of an rbridge. 

3.1. RBridge Device 

   An rbridge is a bridge-like device that forwards frames on an 
   Ethernet link subnet. It has one or more Ethernet ports which may be 
   wired or wireless; the particular physical layer is not relevant. An 
   rbridge is defined more by its behavior than its structure, although 
   it contains two tables which distinguish it from conventional 
   bridges. 

   Conventional bridges contain a learned port table (LPT) and a 
   spanning tree table (STT). The LPT allows a bridge to avoid 
   broadcasting all received frames, as is required for a hub. The 
   bridge learns which nodes are accessible from a particular port by 
   assuming bidirectionality: the source addresses of incoming frames 
   indicate that the incoming port is to be used as output for frames 
   destined to that address. Incoming frames are checked against the LPT 
   and forwarded to the particular port if a match occurs, otherwise 
   they are broadcast out all ports except the incoming port. 

   The STT indicates the ports used in the spanning tree. [TO BE 
   COMPLETED] 

   [what are the actual names of LPT and STT?] 

   RBridges, by comparison, have a Campus Forwarding Table (CFT) and a 
   Campus Transit Table (CTT), described in the following sections. 

3.2. CFT 

   The CFT is a forwarding table for internal traffic, allowing tunneled 
   traffic to transit the campus from ingress to egress. The size of a

Internet-Draft           RBridge Architecture             November 2005 
    

   fully-populated CFT is bounded by the number of egress rbridges. 
   Rbridges may have separate CFTs for each VLAN, if separate VLANs are 
   supported by manual configuration. The CFT is continually maintained 
   by the internal routing protocol (see Section ??). 

3.3. CTT 

   The CTT determines how incoming external traffic will be 
   encapsulated, and indicates the Ethernet link address of the egress 
   of the rbridge campus. The CTT can be considered a version of the LPT 
   that operates across the rbridge campus as a whole. It is configured 
   in much the same way as the LPT: by snooping incoming traffic, and 
   assuming bidirectionality (see Section 4.8.2). The information is 
   learned at the egress rbridge and propagated to all possible 
   ingresses using an internal routing protocol (also Section 4.8.2). 
   The CTT may be populated on-demand or a-priori, and may be as large 
   as the number of nodes on the Ethernet subnet. Rbridges may have 
   separate CTTs for each VLAN, if separate VLANs are supported by 
   manual configuration. 

4. Functional Description 

   The architecture of an rbridge is largely defined by its behavior; 
   the physical components are minimal, as outlined in Section 3. The 
   following setions  

4.1. RBridge Campus Autoconfiguration 

   RBridges self-organize to compose a single RBridge campus system. 
   Consider first a set of bridges on a single Ethernet link subnet 
   (Figure 1). Here bridges are shown as 'b', hubs as 'h', and nodes as 
   'N'; bridges and hubs are numbered. Note that the figure does not 
   distinguish between types of nodes, i.e., hosts and routers; both are 
   just nodes at the link layer, and are otherwise indistinguishable. 
   The bridges organize into a single spanning tree, as shown by double 
   lines ('=', '||', and '//') in the figure.

           Figure 1 Conventionally bridged Ethernet link subnet 

   It is useful to notice that hubs are transparent to bridges, both for 
   traffic from nodes to bridges (h1) and for traffic between bridges 
   (h2). Also note that the same hub can support traffic between bridges 
   and from a host to a bridge (h2), but that the spanning tree is 
   exclusively between bridges. Bridges are thus compatible with hubs, 
   both as transits and ingress/egress. 

   An RBridge campus has a similar spirit, and can be viewed as a 
   variant of the way bridges self-organize. Figure 2 shows the same 
   topology where some of the rbridges are replaced by rbridges. In this 
   figure, stars ('*') represent the paths the rbridge is capable of 
   utilizing, due to the use of link state routing. Rbridges can tunnel 
   directly to each other (r4-r5), or through hubs (h2) or bridges (b8).

                  Figure 2 RBridged Ethernet link subnet 

   Every node in an rbridge is considered to have a primary point of 
   attachment to the rbridge campus, as defined by the designated 
   rbridge. Each Ethernet link segment attached to an rbridge campus has 
   a single designated rbridge; that rbridge is where all traffic that 
   transits the rbridge enters and exits. In Figure 2, it is easy to see

   that the nodes off of h1 must attach at r4; the nodes off of b3, 
   however, attach at either r5 or r6, depending on which is the 
   designated rbridge. 

   Without loss of generality, an rbridge topology can be reorganized 
   (ignoring link length) such that all nodes, hubs, and bridges are 
   arranged around the periphery, and all rbridges are considered 
   directly connected by their tunnels (Figure 3). Note that this does 
   ignore the ways in which hubs and bridges may serve both on the 
   ingress/egress and for transit, so it is not used for traffic 
   analysis. This is a more convenient functional view because it is 
   easier to see the 'inside' and 'outside' of the campus clearly. The 
   devices can easily distinguish between inside and outside traffic on 
   shared devices, such as h2 and b8, because internal traffic content 
   is hidden from these devices by the tunnel encapsulation header.

4.3. Tunneling 

   Rbridges exchange internal traffic with each other over tunnels. 
   These tunnels use an Ethernet link layer header, together with a shim

   header; it is the combination of these headers that distinguishes 
   interior traffic from exterior. The link header includes source and 
   destination addresses, which typically identify the ingress and 
   egress rbridges. For incoming multicast and broadcast traffic, one of 
   these addresses may represent the multicast group or broadcast 
   address. Additionally, these addresses may be VLAN-specific, i.e., 
   such that each ingress and egress address have per-VLAN addresses. 

   The additional shim header is required to support loop prevention for 
   internal traffic; external traffic loops are prohibited by the 
   spanning trees that remain on the ingress/egress links. This shim 
   header may record the rbridge transit route, a hopcount, or a 
   timestamp to prevent indefinite looping of a frame. This shim header 
   should clearly identify the traffic as rbridge, i.e., the outer 
   Ethernet header should use a protocol number unique to rbridges.

4.9. External Protocols 

   The rbridge campus may participate in Ethernet link protocols, 
   notably the spanning tree protocol (STP) on the ingress/egress links. 
   There are three variants; it is anticipated that only one of these 
   variants would be supported by an instance of the rbridge 
   architecture. All rbridges within a single campus must use the same 
   protocol for interacting with external protocols. 

4.9.1. Outgoing BPDU Interactions 

   All three protocols describe reactions of an rbridge campus to 
   incoming BPDUs, but do not preclude preemptive emission of a campus 
   of BPDUs to the external segments. Such BPDUs might indicate that the 
   each designated rbridge is the root of its corresponding external

   segment's spanning tree, which may be necessary for proper overall 
   configuration. 

4.9.2. Incoming BPDU Interactions 

   There are three ways in which an rbridge campus may interact with 
   incoming BPDUs. The first two of these, Transparent-STP and 
   Participate-STP, cause the rbridge campus to emulate the behavior of 
   known Ethernet devices. In the last variant, Block-STP, the campus 
   does not emulate a known Ethernet device. Block-STP may have 
   substantial benefits on the stability of the spanning trees on 
   external links, but may also require that rbridge be the only 
   Ethernet device system permitted this privilege - as enforced at the 
   protocol level. 

4.9.2.1. Transparent-STP 

   An rbridge campus may internally broadcast spanning tree messages 
   (BPDUs) arriving at designated rbridges, emitting one copy on each 
   egress link. Such an rbridge campus is said to support 'Transparent-
   STP', and that campus emulates a single hub connected to each link at 
   the designated rbridge. Because hubs are compatible with bridges 
   running STP, a transparent-STP campus is similarly compatible. 

   Transparent-STP reduces the complexity of the spanning tree in an 
   Ethernet link subnet because rbridges do not directly participate in 
   the spanning tree. It still requires that BPDUs be broadcast 
   throughout the rbridge campus, which can cause the external spanning 
   tree protocol to be delayed until the rbridge campus is configured. 
   The cost of these broadcasts can be reduced by use of an efficient 
   internal routing protocol (e.g., supporting broadcast), but the cost 
   is higher than in unicast (e.g., Participate-STP) and blocking (e.g., 
   Block-STP) schemes. 

4.9.2.2. Participate-STP 

   An rbridge campus may interpret BPDUs received at its ingress 
   rbridges and emit new BPDUs at its egress rbridges to reflect its 
   internal default spanning tree. A campus is expected to have one or 
   more internal spanning trees, e.g., to use for broadcast traffic, but 
   these trees are computed by the internal routing protocol rather than 
   STP. Participate-STP allows this internal spanning tree to be spliced 
   to the spanning trees on external segments. 

   A participate-STP campus emulates a single bridge device, just as 
   transparent-STP emulates a single hub device. Participate-STP is 
   similarly compatible with existing bridges and hubs, although the

   resulting Ethernet subnet spanning tree may be different. Here too, 
   as with transparent-STP, the benefit to spanning tree scalability 
   lies in the (presumably) more efficient and stable computation of the 
   internal spanning tree using the internal routing protocol. Here too, 
   the external spanning trees are affected by waiting for the internal 
   spanning tree to be computed. 

   In this case, there are concerns about the 'chicken and egg' problem; 
   the external spanning trees need to configure before they can transit 
   traffic, notably traffic between rbridges used to exchange the 
   internal routing protocol - which itself is used to determine the 
   internal spanning tree. This case must be addressed in the protocol 
   if this variant is selected. 

4.9.2.3. Block-STP 

   An bridge campus may completely block BPDUs received at its ingress

8. IANA Considerations 

   This document has no direct IANA considerations. It does suggest, in 
   Section ??, that protocols that instantiate the rbridge architecture 
   use a shim header as a wrapper on the payload to internal traffic. 
   This shim header should be identified by a new protocol type in the 
   tunneled Ethernet link header. This protocol, as an identifier in an 
   802 header, should probably be allocated by the IEEE and coordinated 
   with IANA.
