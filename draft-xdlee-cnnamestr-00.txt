1. Abstract
There are many requirements of developing internationalized and 
human-readable Internet identifiers/names now, thereby there are many 
systems based on DNS technology to meet such requirements. John C. 
Klensin has proposed a three-layer search-based access model for the DNS 
[DNSSEARCH]; this paper is only to explain some related problems 
mentioned in John C. Klensin's proposal. Especially it focuses on 
Traditional and Simplified Chinese problems and some other special 
Chinese requirements. 

The ultimate goal for any kinds of search-based access system is to help 
users to access network resources in more natural ways, which have 
different meaning for different user groups. On the premise of respecting 
Chinese user's language convention, it is very important for a valuable 
and human-friendly system to deal with traditional and simplified Chinese 
equivalence problems.

2. Terminology
The key words "SHALL", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "RECOMMENDED", "MUST", and 
"MAY" in this paper are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

In order to describe the problem simply, we define these terminologies 
first. 

"TC" is an abbreviation for Traditional Chinese.

"SC" is an abbreviation for Simplified Chinese.

"CNS" is defined as an acronym of Chinese Name String that is the most 
important facet, name string mentioned in [DNSSEARCH], which contains at 
least one Chinese character. As to the scope of Chinese character, please 
refer to ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000(E) [second edition 2000-09-15], if one 
character is marked "C and G-Hanzi-T", it MUST be a Chinese character, 
such definition does not mean it is not the character of other countries 
that use HAN ideograph.

"TC-only CNS" is a CNS that all characters of it are TC characters.

"SC-only CNS" is a CNS that all characters of it are SC characters.

"Mixed-use TC and SC CNS" is a CNS of which at least one traditional and 
one simplified Chinese character appear in all characters.

3.	CNS equivalence
The TC/SC equivalence problem is very complex and difficult to solve 
perfectly, please refer to [CTCC], nevertheless, there are mainly three 
categories of single TC/SC character equivalence, so we should solve 
these problems respectively and one by one, after solving these three 
kinds of problems, most of the TC/SC problems will be solved, and the 
result will be acceptable for most Chinese users.
a)	One to one 
E.g. U+98A8 (TC, "the wind") can be mapped to U+98CE (SC, the wind)
U+5099 (TC, to prepare) can be mapped to U+5907 (SC, to prepare)
U+908A (TC, a side) can be mapped to U+8FB9 (SC, a side)
b)	One to many
E.g. U+6FF1 (TC, the shore) can be mapped to U+6EE8,U+6D5C (SC, the 
shore)
U+53C3 (TC, three, to take part in) can be mapped to U+53C2 (SC, to take 
part in) U+53C1 (SC, three)
U+58DF (TC, a ridge or walkway in a field) can be mapped to U+5784,U+5785 
(SC, a ridge or walkway in a field)
c)	Many to one
E.g. U+85F9,U+8B6A (TC, friendly) can be mapped to U+853C (SC, friendly)
U+5225 (TC, to leave), U+5F46 (TC, to awkward) can be mapped to U+522B 
(SC, to leave, to awkward)
U+93DF (TC, a shovel), U+5277 (TC, a shovel) can be mapped to U+94F2 (SC, 
a shovel)
But as to the equivalent problem of CNS, it is a combination of above 
three categories, so it is more complex than single character, but we 
could process it one character by one character.

4.	Requirements
These requirements SHOULD be considered for any system supported Chinese 
name string.
a)	TC and SC CNS equivalent matching
SC is derived from TC, and Chinese people use both SC and TC. So Chinese 
people think that TC CNS is equivalent with its corresponding SC forms, 
so any implementation should meet such requirement.
b)	Mixed TC and SC CNS cause an exponential problem
If we want to ensure a CNS in both TC/SC forms to be resolved correctly, 
we could register all its forms, but along with the length of label, an 
exponential problem will occur. Most of Chinese character variants are 
daily used. An ordinary Chinese Name String may have dozens of, hundreds 
of, even thousands of TC/SC variants. That is unreasonable for users to 
register, and uneasy for administrators to manage, and complex for system 
to resolve. No matter which kind of search-based access system, flat or 
hierarchy, or central-controlled, and so on, it is not reasonable for any 
administration to process these thousands of name strings 
un-automatically.
c)	Some other special requirement
As you know, there are many conventional differences between Chinese and 
English. Such as of name string sequence. English people could write 
"Minneapolis, Minnesota" to represent a location, but Chinese people 
would like to write as "Minnesota, Minneapolis". So if we permit 
search-based access system to use sequence attributes to represent 
delegation or hierarchy, such kind of special requirement should be 
satisfied.

5.  Solution suggested 
As mentioned in [DNSSEARCH], there are many challenges in doing 
traditional and simplified Chinese equivalence, because HAN character is 
not only used in China, but also in other countries, mostly in Asia. To 
be emphasized firstly, no method could solve traditional and simplified 
Chinese equivalence perfectly and correctly, and up to now, the best 
algorithm is only able to achieve about 99%, rather than 100%. So maybe 
that is the reason why no consensus has been made in IDN WG.

Because we have two facets in search layer two, language and country 
code/ geographical location, which will be very useful to solve most of 
the problems. Based on these two facets, system with certain language and 
country code could pick appropriate rules to do traditional and 
simplified Chinese equivalence without any impact on other languages and 
countries.

In Mainland China, as to "One to One" and "Many to One", we could convert 
all these TC character into SC character, and then save SC-only CNS into 
database for Chinese name string resolving. But as to "One to Many", it 
maybe based on context, the system may handle this in artificial 
intelligent method, it is a pity that even the best artificial 
intelligent algorithm cannot solve this conversion completely. As in my 
opinion, this kind of artificial conversion shouldn't be completed in 
layer two, which should have affirmative result with some simple facets; 
these artificial process should be completed in layer three or get user's 
feedback to make sure which name string he want. User's feedback may be 
added when doing conversion, or using result cached by last conversion.

E.g. 
a)	One to one
{[CN] + [zh-cn] + TC} --> {[CN] + [zh-cn] + SC}
b)	Many to one
{[CN] + [zh-cn] + TC1/TC2/í¡/TCn}  --> {[CN] + [zh-cn] + SC}
c)	One to many
                       User feedback
{[CN] + [zh-cn] + TC} -------------------> {[CN] + [zh-cn] + SC1/í¡/SCn}

Finally, all Mixed-use TC and SC CNS should be converted into SC-only CNS 
before resolving, and only SC-only CNS are stored in resolving database 
in server. What's more, if we do want to implement "One to Many" 
conversion in layer two, we could bind the TC CNS with one of its 
corresponding SC forms with "first come, first use" based on reasonable 
principle, that is, the binding process should avoid binding two 
irrelevant CNS and cause meaningless equivalent resolving.

As shown above, Mainland of China could select conversion rules from TC 
to SC, for TC area, they could select contrary rules from SC to TC. In 
this suggestion, user feedback is very important for One to Many 
conversion, we just provide a mechanism to resolve CNS correctly, it 
permit user to input unconventional Mixed-use TC and SC CNS in certain 
language and country or area, but actually it doesn't happened very 
often. 

Some people suggest to use fuzziness level to determine matching 
precision, they want user to select which kind of conversion they want, 
it is not useful to solve TC/SC equivalence problem, I think, traditional 
and simplified Chinese equivalence problem is not a fuzziness problem as 
other fuzzy matching problems in search-based access system. Providing 
fuzziness level Chinese matching will mislead end users, and will cause 
questionable namespace in layer two. Chinese name string should have same 
process rules in system level, which should not be based on user 
intention completely. 

6.	Phonetic input of Chinese name string
Phonetic input is very useful for users to surf the Internet in an easy 
way, especially for some application in mobile device without convenient 
input device, thus many vendors have developed many applications, but 
this method should be employed carefully in search layer two. 

Any language has its pronunciation manner, Chinese doesn't make any 
exception, PINYIN is the official standard to mark the pronunciation of 
certain Chinese word, and some people once suggest using such roman 
manner to substitute Chinese glyph, which is actually only advocated by 
some academic scholar, because no one want to lost the beautiful Chinese 
glyph forever, even though someone has developed a method using roman 
PINYIN with certain number to represent any Chinese character. 

Although the simplified Chinese character has the same pronunciation and 
PINYIN with its traditional Chinese form, PINYIN is not very useful to 
solve traditional and simplified Chinese equivalence problems in layer 
two. Name string is to denote the consentient label, name or identifier 
or something else of network resource itself, but PINYIN cannot be used 
as name string. 

7. Encoding 
In layer two and layer three or above, as to the encoding of Chinese 
character, we suggest using UNICODE directly, any additional encoding 
will increase the system complexity, and it is unreasonable for a long 
term solution.

8. Security Considerations
This paper is just a complement document for [DNSSEARCH], so it has same 
security considerations. TC/SC CNS equivalence problem will not bring any 
additional security problems into this search-based access model.
