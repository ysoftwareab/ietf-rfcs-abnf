Abstract

   This document contains an early draft of a "road map" for the
   Requests for Comment (RFC) documents relating to TCP (Transmission
   Control Protocol), STD 7.  This roadmap is intended to provide a
   brief summary of the RFC documents that define the current "state" of
   TCP standardization and documentation, as a guide to new and old
   implementors.

1.  Introduction

   The correct and efficient implementation of TCP (Transmission Control
   Protocol), STD 7, is a critical part of Internet host software.  As
   TCP has evolved over the years, more and more distinct documents have
   become part of the accepted standard for TCP.  At the same time, a
   large number of proposed modifications to TCP have been published in
   RFCs.

   As an introduction to newcomers and an attempt to organize the
   information for old hands, this document contains a "roadmap" to the
   TCP-related RFCs.  It provides a brief summary of the relevant RFC
   documents that summarize the "state" of TCP, for the guidance of all
   implementors.

   This roadmap includes a very brief description of the contents and
   relevance of each TCP-related RFC.  In some cases, we simply supply
   the Abstract or some key summary sentence from the text as the best
   terse description (ideally, an RFC Abstract would ALWAYS be the best
   summary!).  In addition, a letter code after each RFC number
   indicates its category in the RFC series:

           S - Standards Track (Proposed Standard, Draft Standard,
                                or Standard)
           E - Experimental
           B - Best Current Practice
           I - Informational

   Note that the category of each RFC does not necessarily reflect its
   current relevance.  For instance, RFC 2581 is nearly universally
   deployed although it is only a "Proposed Standard".  Similarly, some
   "Informational" RFCs actually technical contain proposals for
   changing TCP.

   This is a very preliminary version of the TCP roadmap, published in

DRAFT                         TCP Roadmap                  February 2004


   hopes that others will refine and deepen its contents.   It needs a
   great deal of work, with much additional discussion of the relevance
   and currency of the various RFCs.  On the other hand, we believe that
   this document already presents a useful model for surveys in many
   other areas of Internet technology.

   Section 2 lists the RFCs that form the core TCP specification.
   Section 3 lists some RFCs that provide suggestions for implementers
   or concern issues raised by particular network environments. Section
   4 lists RFCs that are experimental and may one day become standards,
   Section 5 lists deprecated extensions, Section 6 contains case
   studies and analysis, and Section 7 provides tips and tools for
   implementers.  Within each section, RFCs are listed in chronological
   order.

   systems and the TCP options that they support is at:

2. CORE SPECIFICATION

   RFC 0793 S: "Transmission Control Protocol", STD 7 (Sep 81)

      This is the fundamental specification of TCP.  Written by Jon
      Postel as part of the core Internet protocol suite, it describes
      TCP packet formats and its semantics for data transmission,
      reliability, flow control, multiplexing, acknowledgement,
      precedence, and security.

   RFC 1122 S: "Requirements for Internet Hosts - Communication Layers"
      (Oct 89)

      This document updates and clarifies RFC 793; it is a must-read for
      any TCP implementor.

   RFC 1213 S: "Management Information Base for Network Management of
      TCP/IP-based Internets: MIB-II" (Mar 91)

      This document defines the management data that a TCP
      implementation is required support.

   RFC 1323 S:  "TCP Extensions for High Performance" (May 92)

      This document introduces window scaling, timestamps, and
      protection against wrapped sequence numbers for efficient and safe
      operation over paths with large bandwidth-delay products.  It is
      implemented in Linux and BSD but is a non-default option in
      Windows.

DRAFT                         TCP Roadmap                  February 2004


      There are some corner cases in this specification that are still
      under discussion.

   RFC 2012 S: "SNMPv2 Management Information Base for the Transmission
      Control Protocol using SMIv2" (Nov 96)

      This document defines the TCP MIB.  See also RFC 2452.

   RFC 2018 S: "TCP Selective Acknowledgement Options" (Oct 96)

      This document defines the sective acknowledgements (SACK)
      mechanism, a fundamental TCP enhancement.  SACK is currently
      implemented in Windows, Linux, and BSD.

   RFC 2452 S: "IP Version 6 Management Information Base for the
      Transmission Control Protocol"  (Dec 98)

      This document augments RFC 2012 by adding an IPv6-specific
      connection table. The rest of 2012 holds for any IP version.
      ((Shouldn't 2452 "Update" 2012 ?))

   RFC 2581 S: "TCP Congestion Control" (Apr 99)

      This document defines the current versions of Van Jacobson's
      congestion avoidance and control mechanisms for TCP, based on his
      1988 SIGCOMM paper.

   RFC 2873 S: "TCP Processing of the IPv4 Precendence Field" (Jun 00)

      This document removes from the TCP spec all processing of the
      precedence bits of the TOS byte of the IP header.  This resolves a
      conflict between RFC 793 and Diff-serv.

   RFC 2883 S: "An Extension to the Selective Acknowledgement (SACK)
      Option for TCP" (Jul 00)

      This document extends RFC 2018 to cover the case of acknowledging
      duplicate packets. ((Shouldn't 2883 "Update" 2018??))

   RFC 2988 S: "Computing TCP's Retransmission Timer" (Nov 00)

      Abstract: "This document defines the standard algorithm that
      Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) senders are required to use to
      compute and manage their retransmission timer.  It expands on the
      discussion in section 4.2.3.1 of RFC 1122 and upgrades the
      requirement of supporting the algorithm from a SHOULD to a MUST."

   RFC 3042 S: "Enhancing TCP's Loss Recovery Using Limited Transmit"

DRAFT                         TCP Roadmap                  February 2004


      (Jan 01)

      Abstract: "This document proposes a new Transmission Control
      Protocol (TCP) mechanism that can be used to more effectively
      recover lost segments when a connection's congestion window is
      small, or when a large number of segments are lost in a single
      transmission window."

   RFC 3168 S: "The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
      to IP" (Sep 01):

      This document defines a means of detecting congestion without
      resorting to loss.  Although congestion notification takes place
      at the IP level, support is required at the transport level.  This
      document specifies the changes in TCP in particular. It updates
      RFC 793 to define two previously-unused flag bits in the TCP
      header.

   RFC 3390 S: "Increasing TCP'S Initial Window" (Oct 02)

      This docuemnt permits a TCP to use an initial window larger that
      one packet during in the slowstart phase. Updates RFC 2581.

   RFC 3517 S: "A Conservative Selective Acknowledgement (SACK)-based
      Loss Recovery Algorithm for TCP" (Apr 03)

      From text: "The algorithm presented in this document conforms to
      the spirit of the current congestion control specification (RFC
      2581), but allows TCP senders to recover more effectively when
      multiple segments are lost from a single flight of data."

3. SPECIAL CASES AND IMPLEMENTATION HINTS

   RFC 1144 S: "Compressing TCP/IP headers for low-speed serial links"
      (Feb 90)

      This document contains Van Jacobson's classic specification of
      TCP/IP header compression.  It is notable for its elegance and
      clarity.

   RFC 2140 I: "TCP Control Block Interdependence" (Apr 97)

      This document suggests how TCP connections might share
      information.  Partially implemented in Linux.

   RFC 2488 B: "Enhancing TCP Over Satellite Channels using Standard
      Mechanisms" (Jan 99)

DRAFT                         TCP Roadmap                  February 2004


   RFC 2525 I: "Known TCP Implementation Problems" (Mar 99)

   RFC 3360 B: "Inappropriate TCP Resets Considered Harmful" (Aug 02)

      This document is a plea to firewall vendors, not to send
      gratuitous TCP RST (Reset) packets for unassigned TCP header bits.
      This practice prevents desirable extension and evolution of the
      protocol and hence is inimical to the future of the Internet.

   RFC 3449 B: "TCP Performance Implications of Network Path Asymmetry"
      (Dec 02)

   RFC 3481 B: "TCP over Second (2.5G) and Third (3G) Generation
      Wireless Networks" (Feb 03)

   RFC 3493 I: "Basic Socket Interface Extensions for IPv6" (Feb 03)

4. EXPERIMENTAL TCP EXTENSIONS

   These documents may one day join the standards track, but they are
   currently not recommended for implementation.

   RFC 2582 E: "The NewReno Modification to TCP's Fast Recovery
      Algorithm" (Apr 99)

      Tweaks to congestion control.

   RFC 2861 E: "TCP Congestion Window Validation" (Jun 00)

      Decaying the congestion window if it hasn't been recently
      utilized.

   RFC 3465 E: "TCP Congestion Control with Appropriate Byte Counting
      (ABC)" (Feb 03)

      Congestion control using number of bytes acknowledged rather than
      number of acknowledgements received.  Implemented in Linux.

   RFC 3522 E: "The Eifel Detection Algorithm for TCP" (Apr 03)

      Use of timestamps to detect spurious timeouts.

   RFC 3540 E: "Robust Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) signaling
      with Nonces" (Jun 03)

      Modified ECN to address security concerns.

5. DEPRECATED TCP EXTENSIONS

DRAFT                         TCP Roadmap                  February 2004


   The RFCs listed here define extensions that failed to arouse
   substantial interest, or were found to be defective.

   RFC 1146 E "TCP alternate Checksum Options" (Mar 90)

      Defined more robust alternatives to TCP checksum.

   RFC 1379 I "Extending TCP for Transactions -- Concepts" (Nov 92)

      See RFC 1644.

   RFC 1644 E "T/TCP -- TCP Extensions for Transactions Functional
      Specification" (Jul 94)

      The inventors of TCP believed that cached connection state could
      be used to eliminate TCP's 3-way handshake, to support single-
      packet request/response exchanges.  RFCs 1379 and 1644 show that
      it is far from simple.  Furthermore, T/TCP foundered on the ease
      of denial-of-service attacks that can result.

   RFC 1693 E "An Extension to TCP: Partial Order Service" (Nov 94)

      This document defines a TCP extension for applications where total
      reliability isn't necessary.

6. CASE STUDIES AND PROTOCOL ANALYSIS

   RFC 1337 I: "TIME-WAIT Assassination Hazards in TCP" (May 92):

      This document pointed out some bad "corner cases" at connection
      close.

   RFC 2357 I: "IETF Criteria for Evaluating Reliable Multicast
      Transport and Application Protocols" (Jun 98)

   RFC 2415 I: "Simulation Studies of Increased Initial TCP Window Size"
      (Sep 98)

   RFC 2416 I: "When TCP Starts Up With Four Packets Into Only Three
      Buffers" (Sep 98)

   RFC 2760 I: "Ongoing TCP Research Related to Satellites" (Feb 00)

   RFC 2884 I: "Performance Evaluation of Explicit Congestion
      Notification (ECN) in IP Networks"  (Jul 00)

   RFC 2914 B: "Congestion Control Principles" (Sep 00).

      Optimizing TCP performance in the presence of a DiffServ scheme.

   RFC 3135 I: "Performance Enhancing Proxies Intended to Mitigate
      Link-Related Degradations"  (Jun 01)

      Monitoring and Debugging TCP/IP Internets and Interconnected
      Devices" (Jun 93)

   RFC 2151 I: "A Primer on Internet and TCP/IP Tools and Utilities"
      (Jun 97)

   RFC 2398 I: "Some Testing Tools for TCP Implementors" (Aug 98)
