Abstract

   The IMAP4rev1 protocol has powerful search facilities as part of the
   core protocol, but lacks the ability to create live, updated results
   which can be easily handled.  This memo provides such an extension,
   and shows how it can be used to provide a facility similar to virtual
   mailboxes.

1.  Conventions used in this document

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client
   messaging user agent and IMAP4rev1 ([IMAP]) server respectively.  The
   examples show a server which supports [ESEARCH] and [IDLE], neither
   extension is required for this specification.  The IDLE command is
   used to denote an extended period of time during which any response
   may be sent to the client.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

   Other capitalised words are typically names of IMAP extensions or
   commands - these are uppercased for clarity only, and are case-
   insensitive.

   draft-cridland-imap-contexts.xml ]]


2.  Introduction

   Although the basic SEARCH command defined in [IMAP], as enhanced by
   [ESEARCH], is relatively compact in its representation, this
   reduction only saves a certain amount of data, and huge mailboxes can
   overwhelm the storage available for results on even relatively high-
   end desktop machines.

   This memo borrows concepts from [ACAP], providing a windowed view
   onto search results, as well as bandwidth and round-trip efficient
   updates.

   It is intended that the protocol may be easily adapted onto the SORT
   command specified in [SORT].


3.  Protocol Changes

3.1.  Overview

   This extension is present in any IMAP4rev1 server which includes the
   string "CONTEXT", or any string beginning "CONTEXT=", within its
   advertised capabilities.

   Such servers also accept three additional return options, and provide
   three new result data items, and no new responses.  The first search



Cridland & King         Expires October 27, 2007                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                IMAP CONTEXT                    April 2007


   return option is CONTEXT, an optional hint that the criteria will be
   used repeatedly, and is defined in Section 3.2.

   The second is UPDATE, which causes the server to provide efficient
   notifications of changes to the results.  This is defined in
   Section 3.3.

   Finally, the PARTIAL return specifier causes the server to return a
   subset of the results in set-syntax.  This allows for "virtual
   scrollbars" and other UI conveniences to be achieved without having
   to preload the entire result set, and is described in Section 3.4.

   All of the return specifiers have no interaction with either each
   other or any return specifiers defined in [ESEARCH].

3.2.  Context Hint

   The return option CONTEXT SHOULD be used by a client to indicate that
   subsequent use of the criteria are likely.  Servers MAY ignore this
   return option, or use it as a hint to maintain a full result set, or
   index.

   A client might choose to obtain a count of matching messages prior to
   obtaining actual results.  Here, the client signifies its intention
   to fetch the results themselves:

       C: A01 SEARCH RETURN (CONTEXT COUNT) UNDELETED
          UNKEYWORD $Junk
       S: * ESEARCH (TAG "A01") COUNT 23765
       S: A01 OK Search completed.

3.3.  Notifications of changes

   The search return option UPDATE, if used by a client, causes the
   server to issue unsolicited notifications containing updates to the
   SEARCH results which would be returned by an unmodified SEARCH.
   These results are carried in ADDTO and REMOVEFROM data items in
   ESEARCH/ESORT responses.

   Both ADDTO and REMOVEFROM data items SHOULD be delivered to clients
   in a timely manner, as and when results changes, whether by new
   messages arriving in the mailbox, metadata such as flags being
   changed, or messages being expunged.

   Typically, this would occur at the same time as the FETCH, EXISTS or
   EXPUNGE responses carrying the source of the change.

   Unlike [ACAP], there is no requirement that a context need be created



Cridland & King         Expires October 27, 2007                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                IMAP CONTEXT                    April 2007


   with CONTEXT to use UPDATE, and in addition, the lack of UPDATE with
   a CONTEXT does not affect the results caused by later SEARCH commands
   - there is no snapshot facility.

   There is no interaction between UPDATE and any other return options,
   therefore use of RETURN (UPDATE MIN), for example, does not notify
   about the minimum UID or sequence number, but notifies instead about
   all changes to the set of matching messages.

   In particular, this means that a client using UPDATE and PARTIAL on
   the same search program MAY receive notifications about messages
   which do not interest it currently.

   This time, the client will require notifications of updates, and
   chooses to obtain a count:

       C: B01 UID SEARCH RETURN (UPDATE COUNT) DELETED
          KEYWORD $Junk
       S: * ESEARCH (TAG "B01") COUNT 74
       S: B01 OK Search completed, will notify.

3.3.1.  ADDTO Return Data Item

   The ADDTO return data item contains, as payload, a list containing
   pairs of a position and a set of results to be inserted at the
   position.  For ESEARCH responses, the position MAY be zero, and MAY
   be ignored by clients.

   The results are specified as UIDs or message numbers, depending on
   how the UPDATE was specified.  If the UPDATE was present in a SEARCH
   command, the results will be message numbers; in a UID SEARCH
   command, they will be UIDs.


       C: B02 IDLE
       S: + Idle
       [...]
       S: * 23762 FETCH (FLAGS (\Deleted \Seen))
       S: * ESEARCH (TAG "B01") UID ADDTO (0 32768)
       C: DONE
       S: B02 OK Not Idle.

   Note that this example assumes message 23762 with UID 32768
   previously had neither \Deleted nor $Junk set.  Also note that only
   the ADDTO is included, and not the COUNT.

Internet-Draft                IMAP CONTEXT                    April 2007


3.3.2.  REMOVEFROM Return Data Item

   The REMOVEFROM return data item contains a set of results to be
   removed.  The results to be removed are referenced by message number
   or UID, as appropriate, and need not be in the same order as the
   results.  Servers SHOULD sort the results in order to use the
   sequence-set syntax as efficiently as possible.

   There is no requirement on servers to avoid issuing REMOVEFROM return
   data at any particular moment, in particular this is distinct from
   EXPUNGE responses.

   The results are specified as UIDs or message numbers, depending on
   how the UPDATE was specified.  If the UPDATE was present in a SEARCH
   command, the results will be message numbers; in a UID SEARCH
   command, they will be UIDs.

   Command B03 here is purely an example of a command which prohibits
   EXPUNGE messages.  The REMOVEFROM could have been sent without any
   command in progress.

       C: B03 SEARCH RETURN () 1:* ALL
       S: * ESEARCH (TAG "B03") ALL 1:49152
       S: * ESEARCH (TAG "B01") UID REMOVEFROM 32768
       S: B03 OK Search completed.
       C: B04 IDLE
       S: + Idle
       S: * EXPUNGE 23762
       [...]
       C: DONE
       S: B04 OK Not Idle.

3.4.  Partial results

   The PARTIAL search return option causes the server to provide in an
   ESEARCH response the range from the results denoted by the sequence
   range given as the mandatory argument.  The first result is 1, thus
   the first 500 results would be obtained by a return option of
   "PARTIAL 1:500", and the second 500 by "PARTIAL 501:1000".  This
   intentionally mirrors message sequence numbers.

   Where a PARTIAL search return option references results which do not
   exist, by using a range which starts or ends higher than the COUNT of
   results, then the server returns those results which are in the set.
   This yields a PARTIAL return data item which has, as payload, the
   original range and a potentially missing set of results which may be
   shorter than the extent of the range.

Internet-Draft                IMAP CONTEXT                    April 2007


   The subset of results are returned in sequence-set syntax, and
   servers SHOULD order results from a SEARCH for maximum efficiency.

   Clients need not request PARTIAL results in any particular order.


       // Recall from A01 that there are 23764 results.
       C: A02 UID SEARCH RETURN (PARTIAL 23500:24000) UNDELETED
          UNKEYWORD $Junk
       C: A03 UID SEARCH RETURN (PARTIAL 1:500) UNDELETED
          UNKEYWORD $Junk
       C: A04 UID SEARCH RETURN (PARTIAL 24000:24500) UNDELETED
          UNKEYWORD $Junk
       S: * ESEARCH (TAG "A02") UID PARTIAL (23500:24000 ...)
       // 264 results in set syntax elided,
       // this spans the end of the results.
       S: A02 OK Completed.
       S: * ESEARCH (TAG "A03") UID PARTIAL (1:500 ...)
       // 500 results in set syntax elided.
       S: A03 OK Completed.
       S: * ESEARCH (TAG "A04") UID PARTIAL (24000:24500 NIL)
       // No results are present, this is beyond the end of the results.
       S: A04 OK Completed.

3.5.  Caching results

   Server implementations MAY cache results from a search or sort,
   whether or not hinted to by CONTEXT, in order to make subsequent
   searches more efficient, perhaps by recommencing a subsequent PARTIAL
   search where a previous search left off.  However servers MUST behave
   identically whether or not internal caching is taking place,
   therefore any such cache is required to be updated as changes to the
   mailbox occur.  An alternate strategy would be to discard results
   when any change occurs to the mailbox.

5.  Security Considerations

   It is believed that this specification introduces no serious new
   security considerations.  However, implementors are advised to refer
   to [IMAP].

   Creation of contexts, both for UPDATE and PARTIAL, can benefit from
   storing potentially large result sets on the server.  Implementors
   are advised to take care not to provide a method for denial of
   service (DoS) attacks based on this; the notes in Appendix B may aid
   in implementation decisions.  Note that a server avoiding storing the
   results will have much increased I/O, which may also be an avenue for
   DoS attacks.


6.  IANA Considerations

   IMAP4 capabilities are registered by publishing a standards track or
   IESG approved experimental RFC.  The registry is currently located
   at:

         http://www.iana.org/assignments/imap4-capabilities

   This document defines the CONTEXT IMAP capability.  IANA is requested
   to add it to the registry accordingly.


7.  Acknowledgements

   Much of the design of this extension can be found in ACAP.  Valuable
   comments, both in agreement and in dissent, were received from Alexey
   Melnikov, Arnt Gulbrandsen, Randall Gellens, Cyrus Daboo, and others,
   and many of these comments have had significant influence on the
   design or the text.  The authors are grateful to all those involved,
   including those not mentioned here.

Appendix A.  Cookbook

A.1.  Virtual Mailboxes

   It is possible to use the facilities described within this memo to
   create a facility largely similar to a virtual mailbox, but handled
   on the client side.

   Initially, the client SELECTs the real "backing" mailbox.  Next, it
   can switch to a filtered view at any time by issuing a SEARCH RETURN
   (COUNT UPDATE CONTEXT), and using SEARCH RETURN (PARTIAL x:y) as the
   user scrolls, feeding the results into a FETCH as required to
   populate summary views.

A.2.  Trash Mailboxes

   Certain contexts are particularly useful for client developers
   wishing to present something similar to the common trash mailbox
   metaphor in limited bandwidth.  The simple criteria of UNDELETED only
   matches undeleted messages, and the corresponding DELETED search key
   can be used to display a per-mailbox trash-like virtual mailbox.

Internet-Draft                IMAP CONTEXT                    April 2007


A.3.  Other uses

   It is entirely possible to simultaneously have two or more UPDATE
   searches in operation.  This can be used to build a grouped message
   display in some cases, and also allows for monitoring counts of
   messages matching certain complex criteria.

A.4.  Resynchronizing Contexts

   The creation of a context, and immediate access to it, can all be
   accomplished in a single round-trip.  Therefore, whilst it is
   possible to elide resynchronization if no changes have occurred, it
   is simpler in most cases to resynchronize by simply recreating the
   context.


Appendix B.  Server Implementation Notes

   Although a server may cache the results, this is not mandated nor
   required.  UPDATE processing, for example, can be achieved by
   comparison of the old flag state (if any) and the new, and PARTIAL
   can be achieved by re-running the search until the suitable window is
   required.  This is a result of there being no snapshot facility.

   For example, on a new message, the server can simply test for matches
   against all current UPDATE context search programs, and for any that
   match, send the ADDTO return data.

   Similarly, for a flag change on an existing message, the server can
   check whether the message matched with its old flags, whether it
   matches with new flags, and provide ADDTO or REMOVEFROM return data
   accordingly if these results differ.

   For PARTIAL requests, the server can perform a full search,
   discarding results until the lower bound is hit, and stopping the
   search when sufficient results have been obtained.

   With some additional state, it is possible to restart PARTIAL
   searches, thus avoiding performing the initial discard phase.

   For the best performance, however, caching the full search results is
   needed, which can allow for faster responses at the expense of
   memory.  One reasonable strategy would be to balance this trade-off
   at run-time, discarding search results after a suitable timeout, and
   regenerating them as required.

   This yields state requirements of storing the search program for any
   UPDATE contexts, and optionally storing both search program and
