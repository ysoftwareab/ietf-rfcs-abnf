   encryption algorithm as a block cipher.  This document describes
   sixteen new cipher suites for TLS that specify HMAC-SHA1 and HMAC-
   SHA2.


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies a set of elliptic curve cipher suites for the
   Transport Security Layer (TLS) protocol to support the Camellia
   encryption algorithm as a block cipher.  This document describes
   sixteen new cipher suites for TLS that specify HMAC-SHA1 and HMAC-
   SHA2.

   The algorithm specification and object identifiers are described in
   [RFC3713].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Cipher Suites

   This document defines sixteen new cipher suites to be added to TLS.
   All use Elliptic Curve Cryptography for key exchange and digital
   signature, as defined in [RFC4492].

   The sixteen cipher suites use Camellia [RFC3713] in Cipher Block
   Chaining (CBC) mode with HMAC-based MAC.

   The cipher suites defined here have the following identifiers:

4.  Security Considerations

   At the time of writing this document, there are no known weak keys
   for Camellia.
