                  NSEC(3) TTLs and NSEC Aggressive Use
                      draft-ietf-dnsop-nsec-ttl-02

Abstract

   Due to a combination of unfortunate wording in earlier documents,
   aggressive use of NSEC(3) records may deny names far beyond the
   intended lifetime of a denial.  This document changes the definition
   of the NSEC(3) TTL to correct that situation.  This document updates
   RFC 4034, RFC 4035, and RFC 5155.

   [RFC2308] defines that the SOA TTL to be used in negative answers
   (NXDOMAIN or NODATA) is

Internet-Draft                  nsec-ttl                    January 2021


   |  the minimum of the MINIMUM field of the SOA record and the TTL of
   |  the SOA itself

   Thus, if the TTL of the SOA in the zone is lower than the SOA MINIMUM
   value (the last number in a SOA record), the negative TTL for that
   zone is lower than the SOA MINIMUM value.

   However, [RFC4034] section 4 has this unfortunate text:

   |  The NSEC RR SHOULD have the same TTL value as the SOA minimum TTL
   |  field.  This is in the spirit of negative caching ([RFC2308]).

   This text, while referring to RFC2308, can cause NSEC records to have
   much higher TTLs than the appropriate negative TTL for a zone.
   [RFC5155] contains equivalent text.

   [RFC8198] section 5.4 tries to correct this:

   |  Section 5 of [RFC2308] also states that a negative cache entry TTL
   |  is taken from the minimum of the SOA.MINIMUM field and SOA's TTL.
   |  This can be less than the TTL of an NSEC or NSEC3 record, since
   |  their TTL is equal to the SOA.MINIMUM field (see [RFC4035],
   |  Section 2.3 and [RFC5155], Section 3).
   |  
   |  A resolver that supports aggressive use of NSEC and NSEC3 SHOULD
   |  reduce the TTL of NSEC and NSEC3 records to match the SOA.MINIMUM
   |  field in the authority section of a negative response, if
   |  SOA.MINIMUM is smaller.

   But the NSEC(3) RRs should, per RFC4034, already be at the MINIMUM
   TTL, which means this advice would never actually change the TTL used
   for the NSEC(3) RRs.

   As a theoretical exercise, consider a TLD named ".example" with a SOA
   record like this:

   "example.  900 IN SOA primary.example. hostmaster.example. 1 1800 900
   604800 86400"

   The SOA record has a 900 second TTL, and a 86400 MINIMUM TTL.
   Negative responses from this zone have a 900 second TTL, but the
   NSEC(3) records in those negative responses have a 86400 TTL.  If a
   resolver were to use those NSEC(3)s aggressively, they would be
   considered valid for a day, instead of the intended 15 minutes.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  NSEC(3) TTL changes

3.1.  Updates to RFC4034

   Where [RFC4034] says:

   |  The NSEC RR SHOULD have the same TTL value as the SOA minimum TTL
   |  field.  This is in the spirit of negative caching ([RFC2308]).

   This is updated to say:

   |  The NSEC RR SHOULD have the same TTL value as the lesser of the
   |  MINIMUM field of the SOA record and the TTL of the SOA itself.
   |  This matches the definition of the TTL for negative responses in
   |  [RFC2308].

3.2.  Updates to RFC4035

   Where [RFC4035] says:

   |  The TTL value for any NSEC RR SHOULD be the same as the minimum
   |  TTL value field in the zone SOA RR.

   This is updated to say:

   |  The TTL value for any NSEC RR SHOULD be the same TTL value as the
   |  lesser of the MINIMUM field of the SOA record and the TTL of the
   |  SOA itself.  This matches the definition of the TTL for negative
   |  responses in [RFC2308].

3.3.  Updates to RFC5155

   Where [RFC5155] says:

   |  The NSEC3 RR SHOULD have the same TTL value as the SOA minimum TTL
   |  field.  This is in the spirit of negative caching [RFC2308].

   This is updated to say:

Internet-Draft                  nsec-ttl                    January 2021


   |  The NSEC3 RR SHOULD have the same TTL value as the lesser of the
   |  MINIMUM field of the SOA record and the TTL of the SOA itself.
   |  This matches the definition of the TTL for negative responses in
   |  [RFC2308].

   Where [RFC5155] says:

   |  o The TTL value for any NSEC3 RR SHOULD be the same as the minimum
   |  TTL value field in the zone SOA RR.

   This is updated to say:

   |  o The TTL value for any NSEC3 RR SHOULD be the same as the lesser
   |  of the MINIMUM field of the zone SOA RR and the TTL of the zone
   |  SOA RR itself.

3.4.  No updates to RFC8198

   Instead of updating three documents, it would have been preferable to
   update one.  [RFC8198] says:

   |  With DNSSEC and aggressive use of DNSSEC-validated cache, the TTL
   |  of the NSEC/NSEC3 record and the SOA.MINIMUM field are the
   |  authoritative statement of how quickly a name can start working
   |  within a zone.

   Here, the SOA.MINIMUM field cannot be changed to "the minimum/lesser
   of the SOA.MINIMUM field and the SOA TTL" because the resolver may
   not have the SOA RRset in cache.  Because of that, this document
   cannot get away with updating just [RFC8198].  However, if
   authoritative servers follow the updates from this document, this
   should not make a difference, as the TTL of the NSEC/NSEC3 record is
   already set to the minimum value.

4.  Zone Operator Considerations

   If signers & DNS servers for a zone cannot immediately be updated to
   conform to this document, zone operators are encouraged to consider
   setting their SOA record TTL and the SOA MINIMUM field to the same
   value.  That way, the TTL used for aggressive NSEC use matches the
   SOA TTL for negative responses.

4.1.  A Note On Wildcards

   Validating resolvers consider an expanded wildcard valid for the
   wildcard's TTL, capped by the TTLs of the NSEC(3) proof that shows
   that the wildcard expansion is legal.  Thus, changing the TTL of
   NSEC(3) records (explicitly, or by implementation of this document,
   implicitly) might affect (shorten) the lifetime of wildcards.

5.  Security Considerations

   An attacker can prevent future records from appearing in a cache by
   seeding the cache with queries that cause NSEC(3) responses to be
   cached, for aggressive use purposes.  This document reduces the
   impact of that attack in cases where the NSEC(3) TTL is higher than
   the zone operator intended.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add a reference to this document in the
   "Resource Record (RR) TYPEs" subregistry of the "Domain Name System
   (DNS) Parameters" registry, for the NSEC and NSEC3 types.

Acknowledgements

   Ralph Dolmans helpfully pointed out that fixing this in RFC8198 is
   only possible for negative (NXDOMAIN/NODATA) responses, and not for
   wildcard responses.  Warren Kumari gracefully acknowledged that the
   current behaviour of RFC8198, in context of the NSEC TTL defined in
   RFC4034, is not the intended behaviour.  Matthijs Mekking provided
   additional text explaining why this document cannot simply update
   RFC8198.  Vladimir Cunat pointed out that the effect on wildcards
   should be made explicit.  Paul Hoffman, Matt Nordhoff, and Josh Soref
   provided helpful corrections as native speakers.
