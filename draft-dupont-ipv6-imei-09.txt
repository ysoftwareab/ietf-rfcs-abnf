Abstract

   The IPv6 addressing architecture defines a modified EUI-64 format for
   interface identifiers.  These interface identifiers may have global
   scope when a global token is available (e.g., IEEE 802 48-bit MAC or
   IEEE EUI-64 identifiers).  Such a global token, the IMEI
   (International Mobile station Equipment Identity), is defined for GSM
   and UMTS terminals and has the same properties than identifiers based
   on IEEE standards.

Internet-Draft          IMEI-based interface IDs              April 2005


   This document explains the construction of a global IPv6 interface
   identifier from an IMEI.

1.  Modified EUI-64 Interface Identifiers

   The modified EUI-64 format defined by [1] is required for all unicast
   addresses, except those that start with binary value 000.  Two bits
   have a special role in IEEE EUI-64 and in modified EUI-64: the "u"
   bit, one means global scope, zero local scope, and the "g" bit which
   is the "individual/group" in IEEE standards and is always set to zero
   for any modified EUI-64 identifier derived from an IEEE 802
   identifier.

   So when both the "u" and "g" bits are set to one, a modified EUI-64
   identifier has a global scope (i.e. is universal) and is not derived
   from an IEEE identifier.

2.  IMEIs

   The IMEI (International Mobile station Equipment Identities) is 14
   decimal digit number attached to the hardware of any GSM [2], [3] or
   UMTS [4] terminal.  It is usually written on a label in the battery
   compartment of the handset, displayed when dialing the code *#06# (it
   can come with a spare digit and/or the software version number),
   returned by the AT+CGSN command [6] , etc.  The Mobile Station
   Equipment is uniquely defined by the IMEI.

   The EIR (Equipment Identity Register) is the database of all IMEIs,
   it can be used in order to block or trace stolen terminals even only
   some operators currently check IMEIs.

   The IMEI has been divided into a Type Approval Code (which begins by
   a country code) on 6 decimal digits followed by a Final Assembly Code
   on 2 decimal digits and the Serial Number on 6 decimal digits since
   1/1/2003, and is now divided into a Type Allocation Code and the
   Serial Number, both on 6 decimal digits [7].  The IMEI has the same
   properties than an IEEE MAC-48 address, it is attached to the
   hardware and reveals only basic information like the producer and the
   model of the hardware (this is not always true for ESN (Electronic
   Serial Numbers) which are used in some USA mobile phone networks).

   IMEIs are globally unique, two different equipments can be assumed to
   have different IMEIs and when this is not true (manufacturer error,
   hardware problem, cloning) the problem can cause damage at a higher
   level than interface identifier collision, exactly as a MAC address
   collision is a very serous incident which has nothing in common with
   an interface identifier collision.

3.  MEIDs

   CDMA2000 is adopting 3G Mobile Equipment Identifiers (MEIDs) [8]
   which are syntactically consistent with IMEIs.  Both IMEIs and MEIDs
   use 56 bit identifier structure.  MEIDs consist of a manufacturer
   code of 8 hexadecimal digits and a serial number of 6 hexadecimal
   digits.

   This document can be directly applied to MEIDs as proposed in [9].

4.  IMEI/MEID-based Interface Identifiers

   This document defines a method to create an interface identifier in
   the modified EUI-64 format from an IMEI or a MEID.

   The first octet is 03 in hexadecimal ("u" and "g" bits set to one,
   others to zero) followed by the 14 decimal digits of the IMEI in BCD
   (Binary Coded Decimal), i.e. with each decimal digit mapped to its
   value on 4 bits.
   Or 03 in hexadecimal followed by the 14 hexadecimal digits of the
   MEID.

   The IMEI 330001 53 007826 gives the 0333:0001:5300:7826 (usually
   written 333:1:5300:7826) interface identifier.

5.  IMEI/MEID-based DHCPv6 Unique Identifiers

   DHCPv6 specifications [5] define unique and stable identifiers
   (DUIDs) for clients and servers.  When a device has no other network
   interface than the mobile phone one, the IMEI/MEID seems to be the
   best choice for a hardware attached identifier.

   Unfortunately there is currently no provision for DUIDs derived from
   this kind of hardware attached identifiers, so our proposal is to use
   vendor-based DUIDs (DUID-EN, section 9.3, type 2) with the enterprise
   number assigned to the vendor or manufacturer of the device, or, when
   there is none, with by default the ETSI enterprise number (13019
   [10]).

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of IMEI-based interface identifiers are
   exactly the same than for IEEE EUI-64, EUI-48 or MAC-48 based
   interface identifiers.  The concerns about traceability and/or
   privacy are addressed in [11] and its current revision [12].

   The IMEI is supposedly used to report stolen terminals to telecom
   operators.  It seems common sense that these operators are to perform

   some additional owner's identity verification before accepting such
   kind of report.  Somebody capable of intercepting the IMEI of a
   terminal cannot easily report it as stolen.

7.  Acknowledgments

   The idea came during an E-mail exchange about Marcelo Bagnulo's draft
   [13] on random generation of interface identifiers.  Our GSM expert,
   Xavier Lagrange, provides in some seconds all the GSM and 3GPP
   references and the (real) IMEI of the example.  The same idea was
   developed in the EU project "Moby Dick" [14] (signaled by Michelle
   Wetterwald).  Pierre Dupont from Motorola warned about the format
   change.  Bruno Stevant from Cyberte project gave the AT command to
   retrieve the IMEI.  Wassim Haddad from Ericsson Canada proposed to
   extend the document to new 3GPP2's MEIDs.  Thanks to Lila Madour for
   supporting the idea [15] and to Ultan Mulligan for discussion about
   the possible usage in DHCPv6 DUIDs of the ETSI enterprise number.

8.  Changes from Previous Drafts

   The Security Considerations section was updated to answer to a
   concern raised at the 53th IETF at Minneapolis in March 2002.

   A reference to a conference paper which includes this idea was added
   in the Informative References section.

   The document was updated to take the IMEI format change into account.
   The AT command was added.

   Some suggested presentation changes [15] were integrated but more is
   scheduled for the next version near the end of year.
