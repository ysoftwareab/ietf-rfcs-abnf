Abstract

  This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
  for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
  In particular, it describes management objects used for describing
  alarms using the ITU Alarm Model, defined in X.733 and X.736.

1.The SNMP Management Framework

  The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
  components:

   o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

   o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
       purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
       Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
       STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC
       1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described
       in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and
       STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

   o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
       first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of
       the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
       track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
       [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the
       message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906
       [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

   o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
       first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of
       protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
       RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

   o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
       [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
       in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

  A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
  can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
  the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
  defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

  This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
  MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
  translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
  equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
  translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
  information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
  SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
  readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
  MIB.

2. Introduction

  This MIB module defines alarms specific to the model defined in ITU
  X.733[X.733] and X.736[X.736].  This MIB module follows the modular
  architecture defined by the Alarm MIB[ALARM-MIB], in which the
  model-neutral Alarm MIB can be augmented by other alarm information
  defined according to more specific models that determine their
  behaviour and characteristics.


3. ITU Alarm Architecture

3.1 Relation to Alarm MIB

  This MIB will be used in conjunction with the Alarm MIB [ALARM-MIB].

  The relationship between the Alarm MIB and the ITU Alarm MIB is
  expressed by the following:

  The alarmDetailsTable has a corresponding table in the ITU Alarms MIB
  - the ituAlarmTable - with similar indexing. For each row in the
  ituAlarmTable there is one row in the alarmDetailsTable.

  The alarmActiveTable has a corresponding table in the ITU Alarms MIBs
  - the ituAlarmActiveTable - with similar indexing. For each row in the
  ituAlarmTable there is one row in the alarmActiveTable

  Also, the alarmDetailsModelPointer object in the alarmDetailsTable
  points to the ituAlarm module, identifying alarms that comply to the
  ITU alarm model.


3.2 Alarm States

  The raise and clear relationship is defined in the Alarm MIB. The ITU
  alarm model allows for more alarm states.  These states are indicated
  using ituAlarmPerceivedSeverity object.


3.3 ITU-T X.733, X.736 Trap Content

  Mandatory Alarm information from ITU-T X.733, X.736 alarm documents
  has been included in the itAlarmTable and the ituAlarmActiveTable,
  depending on the variability of this information.

4. MIB Overview

  The ituAlarmTable contains information from the ITU Alarm Model about
  possible alarms in the system.

  The ituAlarmActiveTable contains information from the ITU Alarm Model
  about alarms which are currently occurring on the system.

6. Example

  The following example shows a maping of linkUp and linkDown traps
  into the model-neutral MIB [ALARM-MIB] and ITU Alarm MIB.

    alarmDetailsIndex                 3
    alarmDetailsNotificationId        1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.3
    alarmDetailsClearNotificationId   1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.4
    alarmDetailsType                  raise (3)
    alarmDetailsModelPointer          ituAlarmEntry.3
    alarmDetailsRowStatus             active (1)
    ituAlarmEventType                 communicationsAlarm (2)
    ituAlarmProbableCause             cableTamper(61)
    ituAlarmPerceivedSeverity         critical(3)
    ituAlarmAdditionalText            ""
    ituAlarmDetector                  0.0
    ituAlarmServiceProvider           0.0
    ituAlarmServiceUser               0.0


    alarmDetailsIndex                 4
    alarmDetailsNotificationId        1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.4
    alarmDetailsClearNotificationId   1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.3
    alarmDetailsType                  clear (2)
    alarmDetailsModelPointer          ituAlarmEntry.4
    alarmDetailsRowStatus             active (1)
    ituAlarmEventType                 communicationsAlarm (2)
    ituAlarmProbableCause             cableTamper(61)
    ituAlarmPerceivedSeverity         cleared(1)
    ituAlarmAdditionalText            ""

7. Security Considerations


  There are no management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX-
  ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this MIB is
  implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder can
  alter or create any management objects of this MIB via direct SNMP
  SET operations.


Chisholm & Romascanu        Standards Track                    [Page 11]
                             ITU Alarm MIB                  January 2001



  The security related managed objects in this MIB are sensitive since
  they provide information regarding operational condition and quality
  of server, pertaining to security.

  It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
  possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them
  over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features
  for such a secure environment

  SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
  itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
  control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
  GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

  It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
  features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
  of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-
  based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.

  It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
  entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
  configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
  (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
  (change/create/delete) them.
