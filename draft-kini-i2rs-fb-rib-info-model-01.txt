                   Filter-Based RIB Information Model
                  draft-kini-i2rs-fb-rib-info-model-01

Abstract

   This document defines an information model and a data model for the
   I2RS Filter-based Routing Information Base (RIB) Yang model.  A
   routing system uses the Filter-based RIBto program FIB entries that
   process incoming packets by matching on multiple fields within the
   packet and then performing a specified action on it.  The FB-RIB can
   also specify an action to forward the packet according to the FIB
   entries programmed using the RIBs of its routing instance.

1.  Introduction

   The Interface to the Routing System (I2RS)
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture] architecture provides dynamic read and
   write access to the information and state within the routing
   elements.  The I2RS client interacts with the I2RS agent in one or
   more network routing systems.

   This document provides a yang module for the I2RS filter Based
   Routing Information Base (FB-RIB) and describes the I2RS interaction
   with routing filters within a routing element.

   Filter-based routing is a technique used to make packet forwarding
   decisions based on a filter that is matched to the incoming packets
   and the specified action.  It should be noted that that this is

   distinct from the static routes in the RIB
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-info-model] where the routing is destination
   address based.  A Filter-based RIB entry specifies matches on fields
   in a packet (which may include layer 2 fields, IP header fields,
   transport or application fields) or size of the packet or interface
   received on.  The matches are contained in an ordered list of filters
   which contain pairs of match condition-action (aka event-condition-
   action).

   (Note: Filter-based RIBs (FB-RIBs) operate only on the interface the
   FB-RIB are configured on.)

   If all matches fail, default action is to forward the packet using
   FIB entries that were programmed by the Routing Informational Base
   (RIB) manager described in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-info-model].

   Actions in the condition-action pair may impact forwarding or set
   something in the packet that will impact forwarding.  Policy actions
   are typically applied before applying QoS constraints since policy
   actions may override QoS constraint.

   The Filter-Based RIB resides in ephemeral state as does the I2RS RIB
   and I2RS topology models.

   A Filter-Based RIB (Routing Information Base) is contained in a
   routing instance (defined in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-info-model]).  It
   contains a list of filters (match-action conditions), a list of
   interface the filter-based forwarding operates on.

   The filter based-RIB will event-condition-action policy (ECA) rules
   based a set of policies specified by the I2RS FB-RIB.  The filter-
   based RIB may utilize policies defined by common IETF policy modules
   or customer specific policies.  The following policies are used in
   this version of the yang module:

   o  Access lists (ACLs) [I-D.ietf-netmod-acl-model] (Note: The ACL
      Filters do not provide enough depth to support all use cases for
      filter-based FIBS.  These filters are included for cases where
      this limited filters will work.  In early deployments of the FB-
      FIB, these filters may be the only filters provided. ),

   o  Basic network filters [I-D.hares-i2rs-bnp-info-model]

   The Filter-Based routing may provide many benefits, including better
   resource allocation, load balancing and QoS.

   The I2RS use cases which benefit from Filter-Based Routing are:

      RIB Informational Model (RIB IM) [I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-info-model]

   Routing instance

      A routing instance, in the context of the FB-FIB is a collection
      of RIBs, interfaces, and routing parameters.  A routing instance
      creates a logical slice of the router and allows different logical
      slices; across a set of routers; to communicate with each other.

3.  Filter-Based-RIB module

   A Filter-Based RIB (FB-RIB)contains an ordered set of filter routes
   where each filter-route is a match condition followed by an action.
   An FB-RIB is contained in a routing-instance that is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-info-model] and whose data modelling is done in
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-data-model].  An FB-RIB has a list of interfaces
   that is a subset of the list of interfaces in the routing-instance
   that it is contained in.  An incoming packet on an interface
   belonging to a FB-RIB is first handled by the FIB programmed using
   that FB-RIB.  If no match action succeeds, then the packet is
   forwarded using the FIB programmed using the RIB of that routing
   instance.

   An ordered set of filters implies that the insertion of a filter
   route into a FB-RIB MUST provide the ability to insert a filter route
   at any specific position and delete of a filter-based route at a
   specific position.  The ability to change a filter route at a
   specific position combines these two functions (delete an existing
   filter route rule and add a new policy rule).

   Each FB-RIB is contained within a routing instance, but one routing
   instance (named by an INSTANCE_NAME) can contain multiple FB-RIBs.
   Each routing instance is associated with a set of interfaces, a
   router-id, and list of FB-RIBs.  Each interface can be associated
   with at most one FB RIB.

   The processing within the FB-RIB process within the routing system is
   expected to do the following:

   o  When a packet successfully matches match term/entry in a filter-
      route, the corresponding rule-actions are applied.

   o  If a packet does not match the match term/entry in the filter
      route, the filter route processing goes to the next term/entry in
      the order, and looks for a match, within the current filter or
      goes to the next filter in the list.  This continues until either
      a filter route match term/entry is successfully matched, or no
      more filters in the list exists.

   o  If no match has been found within list of filters in FB-RIB list,
      then the packet will be forwarded using the I2RS RIB specified by
      the FB-RIB if one exists.  If no I2RS RIB is specified, the packet
      will be discarded.

3.2.  Relationship between RB-RIB Rule Model and RIB Information Model

   The I2RS RIB module is described in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-info-model]
   and [I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-data-model].  The I2RS RIB contains a
   collection of RIBs with the following information per instance:

   o  The set of interfaces indicates which interfaces are associated
      with this routing instance.

   o  The RIBs specify how incoming traffic is to be forwarded based on
      destination (E.g.  RIB and FB-RIB).

   o  The routing parameters control the information in the RIBs.

   A routing instance may have both an I2RS RIB modules and I2RS FB-FIB
   modules associated with it.

   FB-RIB and RIB can not be used at the same time, which means:

   o  If a router doesn't support filter-based routing, a router MUST
      use RIB and MUST not use FB-RIB.

   o  If a router supports filter-based routing:

      *  FB-RIB is used

      *  Multiple FB-RIBs may exist within a routing instance

      *  An interface can be associated with at most one FB-RIB

      *  The Default RIB for a FB-RIB is used if several criteria beyond
         destination address is not matched.
