1.  Introduction

   This document analyse those kind of services which allow user to
   allocate its extention address which can be used as indications to
   route to its currently associated UA.  Different from GRUU, this
   requirment is in service level and is controlled by the user himself

3.  Analyse

   This is the typical user experience requirements for these kind of
   servicec:

      Req 1: One user have multiple SIP UAs which share the same AOR.

      Req 2: The user can dynamically allocate its prefered extention id
      for each UA which are all associated with the same AOR.

      Req 3: The other caller can make use fo the AOR and extention id
      to route to the associated UA.

      Req 4: The extention id is allocated by User itself, not controled
      by the network.
