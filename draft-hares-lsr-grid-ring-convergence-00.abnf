X = Grid node
G  = Grid node G, Area Leader
GSn = Grid Square n (1-8)

CT-Node = Td + To + Tf + Tspf + Trib + Tdd

CT-Node = Node convergence time
Td = link failure detection time
                 (or link up detection time)
To = time to originate LSP
                     describing the new topology

Tf = Time to flood the change
                     from this node to other nodes
                         that must perform a flood update

Tspf = Time for shortest path calculation

Trib = Time to update the RIB and FIB

Tdd = time to distribute the FIB to line cards

j = nodes on path (1..n)

CTnetwork = maximum (CT-path(i))
                            where i = 0..n paths

CT-network = (Tspf + constant) * maximum path-length

CT-network = (Tspf + constant) * 3

CT-network = (Tf + constant) * 3
