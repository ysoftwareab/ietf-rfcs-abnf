     Abstract 
         
        This document defines an experimental protocol called the Server Load 
        Balancing Registration Protocol (SLBRP).  This protocol permits 
        servers to register and coordinate services with a service load 
        balancing (SLB) application.  Coordination between real servers and 
        the SLB application will include service definition(s), Virtual IP 
        (VIP) address support, server application health monitoring, as well 
        as, optional support for automatic Domain Name System (DNS) and DNS-
        based Global Server Load Balancer (GSLB) updates.  This document also 
        describes Anycast Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) implementations 
        that can operate with an SLB and GSLB based enterprise 
        infrastructure.

     1.        Introduction 
         
            The Server Load Balancing Registration Protocol (SLBRP) permits 
        servers to register services with a server load balancer (SLB) 
        application.  To support server registration the SLB must provide an 
        application that accepts registration messages and based upon these 
        messages, permits the SLB to automatically configure to support 
        server load balancing.  The protocol permits the SLB to accept 
        Virtual IP (VIP) addresses from servers or assign/lease VIP addresses 
        to servers.  Optionally, the SLB can register unique server addresses 
        with a Domain Name System (DNS), support VIP address route injection, 
        and provide service health statistics and server registration with 
        DNS-based Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB) applications.  SLBRP 
        allows servers to gracefully deregister services from the SLB prior 
        to shutdown or prior to leaving the SLB network.  The SLB shall also 
        monitor the health of services registering for load balancing.  As 
        part of this, the SLB can detect servers and service failures and 
        automatically remove servers from service after failure.  The SLB 
        shall also notify the DNS-based GSLB about server and service state 
        changes. 
      
         
     2.        Terminology 
         
        This specification uses a number of terms that may not be familiar to 
        the reader.  This section defines some of these terms and refers to 
        other documents for definitions of others. 
         
        Real Server or Server (RS) 
         
        A real server provides the services being balanced and monitored by 
        the SLB. 
         
        Virtual IP (VIP) Address 
         
        A VIP address permits clients to communicate with one or more real 
        servers using a single address.  The VIP address can be used by 
        clients to connect to a server in lieu of using any of the server∆s 
        real IP addresses.  The server may or may not have the VIP address 
        configured as a loopback address.  If the server does not maintain 
        the VIP address as a loopback address, the server load balancing 
        application will support client connections to the server by Network 
        Address Translation (NAT).  If the server does maintain the VIP as a 
        loopback address, the server can support a concept called Direct 
        Server Return (DSR) and the SLB application does not have to support 
        NAT for client connections.  In support of DSR, the SLB application

        must be able to map VIP connections to servers∆ Ethernet MAC 
        addresses. 
         
        Server Load Balancer (SLB) 
         
        The SLB is an application or set of applications that permits client 
        connections to a service to be distributed across one or more 
        servers.  A service is often distinguished by the application 
        protocol (e.g., HTTP, FTP, etc.), transport protocol used (e.g., TCP, 
        UDP, or SCTP), the application∆s unique TCP, UDP, or SCTP port 
        number, as well as the Virtual IP (VIP) address used by the service.  
        A service can also be distinguished by a unique name or URL [iii]. 
         
        Server Farm 
         
        A server farm is a group of servers that provide the same or similar 
        services.   A real server can participate in separate unique server 
        farms. 
         
        Virtual Server (VS) 
         
        A virtual server represents one or more real servers.  Multiple real 
        servers or a server farm can be represented as one virtual server 
        with one VIP address. 
         
        Route Health Injection 
         
        A SLB application/appliance can advertise a route to the VIP address 
        by injecting the VIP into an IP routing protocol.  If the health of 
        the service fails, the VIP route can be removed.  A VIP address can 
        be a 32 bit route.  In lieu of advertising 32 bit routes within an 
        Intranet, the SLB can be assigned a pool of addresses with clear IP 
        subnet boundaries.  The SLB can then advertise reachability to this 
        IP address pool via an IP routing protocol. 
      
        Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB) 
         
        GSLB provides the ability to direct clients to one or more servers 
        when a server/service is available at multiple geographic locations.  
        DNS-based GSLB permits DNS responses to be based upon the 
        availability of server farms, the approximate location of the client 
        relative to the server farms, and the performance of the networks 
        between the client and server farms.  The specifications about the 
        decision processing associated with directing a client to one or more 
        geographically distributed servers is not part of this specification.

        A set of services, typically making up a logical administrative 
        group.  This protocol leverages the same definition as defined within 
        RFC 2608. 
         
      
     3.        Motivation and Protocol Requirements 
         
        Server Load Balancing (SLB) technology has provided a fundamental 
        cornerstone necessary to the success of the Internet.  Automating SLB 
        configuration will decrease the time, cost, and management required 
        to deploy SLB server farms.  Automating SLB configurations will also 
        decrease the complexity associated with network infrastructure 
        configuration management.  These productivity enhancements have the 
        potential to permit greater use of SLB technology throughout 
        enterprise networks.   
         
        In addition, the proliferation of the local area wireless networks, 
        powerful laptop servers, and mobile systems require that SLB 
        technology evolve to support this new environment.  In particular, a 
        server should have the ability to roam between and among wireless 
        cells and register its services with a SLB application within the 
        area of responsibility for each cell.  This capability allows mobile 
        servers to easily leverage an existing SLB infrastructure without 
        introducing new software and systems that require special management 
        and monitoring. 
         
         
        Requirements for a protocol that permits server load balancing 
        registration include: 
         
        The real server must be able to locate a SLB application that 
        supports server and service registration. 
      
        Messages between the real servers and the SLB device should be 
        authenticated and verified as trustworthy. 
         
        The network load used to maintain communications between the real 
        server and the SLB device must be minimal. 
         
        The computer processing requirements needed to support registration 
        of services by the real server must be minimal. 
         
        The real server should be able to detect failure of the SLB device. 
         
        The real server should be able to report failure of a service to a 
        SLB device and de-register that service from the SLB device. 
         
        The SLB device should be able detect failure of the real server 
        and/or failure of the service(s) supported by the real server.

        After failure detection, the SLB should be able to automatically 
        remove the real server from the server farm. 
         
        Requirements for a protocol that permit VIP address allocation 
        include: 
         
        Ability to maintain a VIP address pool for assignment to real servers 
         
        Ability to identify assigned addresses 
         
        Ability to identify addresses within an address pool that have not 
        been assigned. 
         
        Ability to maintain a lease history for recently assigned VIP 
        addresses. 
         
        Ability to support pre-defined static VIP address assignment for 
        particular servers.  These assignments can be based upon predefined 
        tables or authentication techniques.  In this case, the goal is to 
        help ensure that separate server farm groups not be identified by the 
        same VIP address unless the services offered are easily 
        differentiated. 
         
        Ability to release VIP addresses after server farm failure 
         
        Ability for a real server to request a recently assigned VIP whenever 
        necessary 
         
        For DNS registration of VIP, adhere to the DNS registration standard 
        as defined in RFC 2136 [iv] and RFC 3007 [v]. 
         
        The definition and syntax associated with the scope of a service will 
        adhere to the same definition as defined in RFC 2165, Service 
        Location Protocol Version 2 [vi]. 
         
     4.        Protocol Description 
         
     4.1         Overview 
                                                                              
        The SLB Registration Protocol is a client-server protocol that 
        leverages the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to support 
        communications between the real server and the SLB device.  This TCP 
        connection is expected to remain open as long as the server would 
        like to use the SLB services.  Our initial implementation maintains 
        the real server∆s default router as the local SLB device.  Other 
        possibilities that will permit a server to locate a local SLB device 
        include using an option field within the Dynamic Host Configuration 
        Protocol (DHCP).

        layer reachability to the service. 
         
        In addition, once a VIP instantiation and service registration 
        process has been completed, the SLB device will register the new VIP 
        address with the GSLB application.  Since there can be more than one 
        GSLB application within the enterprise, this registration message 
        generated by the SLB device can be a multicast UDP datagram.  The SLB 
        device will continually monitor the state of all real servers within 
        a server farm.  Based upon the SLB∆s interpretation about the health

        that represents the health of the SLB device∆s directly attached

        The health of a service shall be represented by a number from 0 to 
        100.  That is, if the score is 100, this service is at its maximum 
        capacity and should not be accessed by new clients.  A value of 0 
        indicates the service is completely available.  The algorithms used 
        to calculate this value are left up to the implementation.  The 
        actual scoring mechanism used to itemize the health of the server is 
        beyond the scope of this specification.  Some items that may be 
        considered as part of the health score from either the real server or 
        the SLB include overall service availability, number of active 
        connections, WAN access bandwidth availability, health of the SLB, 
        capability of real servers within the server farm, and any security 
        considerations. 
         
     4.2         SLBRP Message Details 
         
        The SLB Registration Protocol is a client-server protocol.  Real 
        servers will register the services that require support with the SLB 
        device.  The SLB device will load balance the services described by 
        the real server and represent the real server(s) to the network via a 
        VIP address.  The SLB device has an option to register the service 
        with GSLB devices within the enterprise.  Once a service is 
        registered with the GSLB, the GSLB expects periodic updates about the 
        service health.  After three or more update failures, the GSLB device 
        will poll the SLB via UDP unicast to obtain the status about the 
        particular service.  If there is no response, the GSLB will remove 
        the entry about the service from its database. 
         
        Suggested UDP and TCP port numbers used by the SLBRP are provided in 
        Table 2.  Real servers must use the TCP SLBRP port number to register 
        with the SLB.  When the SLB device responds to the real server, it 
        must use a destination port number that matches the source port 
        number provided by the client in the registration message. In 
        addition, port numbers are allocated for UDP-based SLB to GSLB 
        communication and two different Anycast Address Resolution Protocols 
        (AARPs). These operate with the SLB and GSLB.  The following table 
        identifies suggested port numbers.  Except for DNS-based 
        communications, these ports are considered configurable.

     5.        Formal Message Syntax 
         
        This section describes all the messages used to implement the SLB 
        Registration Protocol.  Each message consists of a header and a data 
        section.  Messages shall be sent to the network using network byte 
        order. 
         
     5.1         General Format 
         
        All messages will begin with the following header: 
         
        0               1               2               3

        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
         
         
        The first two characters are used to simplify start of message 
        recognition.  The CRC-16 checksum shall be calculated to include the 
        version, message type, data length, and all data.  The message types 
        are defined in section 5.2.  This document defines Version 1 of the 
        SLBRP. 
         
        The data length shall indicate the number of data bytes following 
        this field.  The range of this length shall be 0 to 65535.  The data 
        string shall contain binary information as defined in the succeeding 
        sections.

        The Null message shall not be used in the network.  This value shall 
        be used as an internal place holder for decoding or encoding actual 
        messages.  Any Null messages receives shall be ignored.  This message 
        shall only contain a data length (0) with no data. 
      
     5.4         Acknowledgement Message 
         
        The Acknowledgement message shall be used to indicate the execution 
        status of certain requests.  Not all requests shall be answered by 
        this message.  Refer to each particular request message to determine 
        the appropriate response. 
         
        The Message Type field indicates which message this acknowledgement 
        pertains to and shall have one of the values defined in section 5.2. 
         
        The Success field shall indicate if the request was successful, where 
        0 indicates success.  All other values indicate a failure and may be 
        used to specify the error.  Values for error codes depend on the 
        message being acknowledged.

     5.5         Shutdown Notification Message 
         
        The Shutdown Request Message shall be sent by a RS, SLB, or GSLB to 
        indicate a planned shutdown.  Each entity shall send the shutdown 
        request to entities that it is currently directly communicating with, 
        except for the GSLB. For example:

        No acknowledgement is required for this message.  If an 
        acknowledgement is sent, it may be ignored.  The message shall 
        contain the IP address of the entity shutting down.   
         
        The SLB shall send this message via TCP to all registered RSs and via 
        UDP to other SLB and GSLB devices.  A RS will only send this message 
        via TCP to any SLBs supporting its registered services.

     5.6         Real Server Heartbeat Update Message 
         
        The Real Server Heartbeat Update is sent from the real server to the 
        SLB.  The intent is for the real server to provide information on the 
        Ùhealthˆ of a particular service.  Each service supported by the real 
        server shall send its own message.  The service health is a score 
        that ranges between 0 and 100.  See section 4.1 for the definition of 
        the health score.  The SLB shall respond back to the real server with 
        an acknowledgement message.  This provides a mechanism for the real 
        server to determine if the SLB has failed.   
         
        The value of the service ID is determined by the RS when it registers 
        the service with the SLB.  The only requirement is that this ID be 
        unique between the RS and its parent SLB. 
         
        This message interval shall default to sixty seconds.  A 5 second 
        jitter timer can be implemented.

     5.7         Real Server Registration Request Message 
         
        The Real Server Registration Request message permits the real server 
        to notify the SLB of its existence.  When the real server begins

        to register its services.  The SLB shall respond with a Real Server 
        Registration Response message.  SLB support for RS services can only 
        be activated by the SLB after it receives and processes separate 
        service registration messages.

        The message shall contain the unique IP address of the registering 
        real server, its host name, and a flag indicating whether the RS 
        should be registered with the local DNS by the SLB.  The flag

        should be registered by the SLB.  The host name field is variable and 
        shall contain Host Name Length characters.  If the host name is not a 
        fully qualified domain name, the SLB shall append its domain name to 
        the server provided host name prior to registering the server with a 
        local DNS.  If the server provides a fully qualified domain name to 
        the SLB, the SLB will register the fully qualified domain name with 
        its local DNS if and only if the RS domain name matches one of the 
        SLB∆s domain names.  If the DNS does not accept the update or if 
        there is a domain name mismatch, the RS will be notified of the DNS 
        registration failure.  Up to 255 ASCII characters may be provided by 
        the real server for its host name.

        The Real Server Registration Response message is sent by the SLB in 
        response to a real server registration.  It supplies the real server 
        with information about the SLB.  This information may be used to help 
        configure the real server to support the SLB∆s capabilities.  The IP 
        Address supplied in this message represents the registering real 
        server∆s address.  The SLB Method indicates the current server load 
        balancing method used by the SLB.  Current values are:

     5.9         Service Address Request Message 
         
        The Service Address Request message allows the real server to request 
        a VIP address from the SLB.  The SLB shall use a configurable pool of 
        IP addresses to allocate VIP addresses to the servers.  The SLB 
        responds to this message with a Service Address Response message. 
         
        A VIP address may be statically allocated to correspond to a specific 
        URL name or one may be dynamically allocated from the VIP address 
        pool.  The static URL/VIP combinations and dynamic ranges shall be 
        user configurable.  An SLB shall return the same dynamic address for 
        a specific URL name for up to a default time of 1200 seconds.  This 
        time shall be configurable.

        The URL Name is the text commonly used to reference a specific 
        service.  An example URL is http://www.mitre.org.  This name is 
        defined when a service is registered.  Up to 255 ASCII characters may 
        be provided. 
         
     5.10          Service Address Response Message 
         
        The Service Address Response allows the SLB to provide a real server 
        with a VIP address.  The real server will then use this VIP address 
        to register at least one service with the SLB.  The URL name 
        originally requested shall also be returned.  If no service is 
        registered by the real server after a VIP address has been allocated, 
        the SLB maintains the option of terminating the VIP lease and 
        unregistering the real server.  Up to 255 ASCII characters may be 
        specified.

     5.11          Service Registration Request Message 
         
        The Service Registration Request message describes the service that 
        the real server would like the SLB to support.  The SLB shall respond 
        to the real server with an acknowledgement message indicating success 
        or failure of the registration.  If the message provides information 
        to the SLB that the particular SLB does not support or does not 
        require, the extra information should be ignored by the SLB. 
         
        The VIP Address is the IP address being used by the server farm for 
        the service being registered.  It may be specified explicitly by the 
        RS or it may be obtained from the SLB using a Service Address Request 
        Message.  If a specific VIP has not been provided or leased by the 
        SLB, separate authentication and security controls can be provided 
        prior to accepting the registration of the server. 
         
        The Port Number is used by the SLB to support requests for a 
        particular virtual service.  This port number shall be configured on 
        the SLB device to provide a port for clients for a given service.  
        This port number is directly associated with the transport protocol 
        being used (e.g., UDP, TCP, or SCTP).  This information also allows 
        the SLB to perform health checks on the service if requested by the 
        real server or required based upon policy configured on the SLB. 
         
        The Transport Protocol corresponds to the value specified by Internet 
        Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).  The information is necessary for 
        the SLB to properly perform health checks when requested and to 
        configure the proper interface.  The following is an example. 
         
                 Transport Protocol         Value 
                 TCP                            6 
                 UDP                           17 
                 SCTP                         132 
         
        The Application Protocol defines the protocol used by the VIP and 
        port number.  The actual value to be used in the field shall be the 
        port number being used by the application protocol.  Additional 
        values may be defined and implemented as desired.  Some examples of 
        the application protocol values include: 
         
                 Application Protocol       Value 
                 HTTP                          80

        The Health Check field indicates whether the real server would like 
        the SLB to perform health checks on a service.  Additional values may 
        be defined and implemented as needed.  A Layer3 health check is 
        performed by the SLB through implementation of the ICMP echo 
        request/echo reply protocol.  The required values shall be as 
        follows: 
         
                 Health Check Type        Value 
                 None                         0

                 HTTP                         2 
         
        The Health Check Frequency provides the interval between health 
        checks.  This indicates the period of health checks performed by the 
        SLB only and not the checks performed by the RS on its own service.  
        Valid values shall be between 1 and 65,535 inclusive. A value of 0 
        indicates no health check is performed.  The default time metric is 
        seconds.   
         
        The Persistence Type determines if the connections between the 
        clients and any real server should remain the same across multiple 
        connections.  Additional values may be defined.  The required values 
        shall be: 
         
                 Persistence Type             Value 
                 None                             0 
                 Client Source IP                 1  
                 SSL ID                           2 
               
         
        The Persistence Time is the time the SLB should maintain persistence 
        data for a particular connection.  The default time metric is 
        minutes.  The range of values shall be 0 to 255.  The use of this 
        field will depend upon the type of persistence being maintained 
        between the real server, SLB, and client. For instance, if cookies 
        are used for persistence this field may not be used. 
         
        The Scheduling parameter defines the type of scheduling algorithm 
        that should be used by the SLB to support the service.  The first 
        real server that defines a unique service not already supported by 
        the SLB defines the scheduling algorithm.  Additional real servers 
        supporting the existing service shall use the existing algorithm.  
        Additional values may be added.  The required values shall be: 
         
                 Scheduling Option           Value 
                 Round Robin                     1

        The Weight parameter defines the weight used by the SLB to distribute 
        the server load within a particular scheduling algorithm.  For 
        instance, this field is used to support weighted round robin 
        scheduling.  The valid range of weights shall be 1 to 255.  If this 
        value is not supported by the SLB, it may scale the value to an 
        appropriate range. 
         
        The Connection Capacity field defines the maximum connections support 
        by the real server.  Once the number of connections for a real server 
        increases beyond the requested connection capacity, the SLB will not 
        balance any more connections to the server until the number of 
        current connections fall below this value.  The valid range shall be 
        0 to 65535.  A value of 0 shall indicate that this metric is ignored 
        by the SLB. 
         
        The Service ID is a unique integer generated by the real server that 
        identifies the service.  This value is used within messages to 
        communicate state changes about the service.  This value is tracked 
        by the SLB.  The service ID must be unique for a given RS and SLB 
        pair.  The valid range shall be 0 to 255.  This message shall define 
        the ID of the service and shall be used in other messages to identify 
        the particular service. 
         
        The URL name uniquely qualifies a service∆s URL.  This information 
        can be used to populate the GSLB database.  This name shall be used 
        by the client to obtain the service.  It shall be a well-known name 
        that is provided by the real server.  Up to 255 ASCII characters may 
        be specified. 
         
        The scope list is borrowed from Service Location Protocol Version 2, 
        RFC 2608.  This is an optional field that provides a list of scope 
        names that defines an administrative group that the service is 
        expecting to support.  Network performance monitor agents that have 
        been configured with any of the scopes will monitor the performance 
        of the services.  The SLB appliance will forward the service's scope 
        list to these agents as part of the SLB Service Information Response 
        Message.  If this field is not part of the message, the scope is 
        considered to be the "DEFAULT" scope.  All network performance agents 
        will monitor services with a "DEFAULT" scope, unless otherwise 
        configured.

     5.13          Real Server DNS Update Message 
         
        The Real Server DNS Update message shall be used by the SLB to notify 
        any locally registered DNS server of a new real server or deleted 
        real server.  The purpose of the update is to make the real server∆s 
        host name and unique IP address available to external hosts.  The SLB 
        may update the DNS directly using the Dynamic DNS Update protocol as 
        defined in RFC 2136.  This is preferred as it eliminates the need for 
        a separate DNS update message.  The SLB shall register a fully 
        qualified domain name with the local DNS as described in Section 5.7. 
         
        Alternatively, a DNS server that has registered with the SLB can be 
        notified of a new real server via its TCP connection to the SLB.  The 
        message described below provides this capability.  The local DNS 
        server shall then update its database via standard∆s based DNS update 
        messages (e.g., defined by RFC 2136) with information about the 
        server.  The locally SLB registered DNS server shall respond with an 
        acknowledgement message to the SLB. 
         
        The IP address indicates the new real server address and the host 
        name indicates the name of the new real server.  The host name may be 
        1 to 255 characters in length as specified by the Host Name Length 
        field.  The Host Active field indicates if the host should be added 
        or deleted from the local DNS.

        The Service Information Request message shall be sent by the GSLB to 
        the SLB requesting the status of one or more services.  The request 
        contains the name of the service or URL.  A value of Ù*ˆ indicates an 
        information request for all services currently supported by the SLB.

        This message may be unicast to a specific SLB or multicast to all 
        SLBs.  When the GSLB initially executes, this message shall be 
        multicast to gather the current SLB configuration and status and 
        allow the GSLB to initially populate its database.

     5.15          SLB Service Information Response Message 
         
        The Service Information Response message is originated by the SLB to 
        notify the GSLB and other SLBs of new servers that arrive or are 
        removed.  This response shall also be used to notify the GSLB of a 
        new SLB joining the network. 
         
        This message shall be sent in response to the GSLB Service 
        Information Request, periodically at a pre-configured interval (or by

        default every 300 seconds), or when the SLB has detected a change in 
        service status.  For the periodic update, a jitter timer of 5% of the 
        periodic update time shall be used.  Since the periodic message is 
        multicast, other SLB devices and infrastructure devices can register 
        to receive this message.  When responding to a Service Information 
        Request from a GSLB, this response shall be unicast to the GSLB.  The 
        SLB can be optionally configured to only respond to predefined GSLB 
        devices.  When responding to a multicast request, the response shall 
        be multicast.  The periodic update shall also be multicast.  The 
        periodic multicast update is used to coordinate services between the 
        SLBs and GSLBs. 
         
        The SLB IP Address specifies the IP address of the sending SLB.  This 
        address is used by the GSLB to uniquely identify each SLB.  This 
        could be a loopback address on the SLB or a particular interface 
        address.   
         
        The SLB Score is the score assigned to just the SLB itself and does 
        not include any supported services.  The score ranges from 0 to 100, 
        where 0 indicates a completely available SLB and 100 a completely 
        loaded SLB.  The purpose is to allow the GSLB to estimate the 
        availability of the SLB itself. 
         
        The extra 16 bits of filler is not defined and may be used as needed.  
        Its purpose is to increase the efficiency of message parsing.  For 
        instance, it could be used to support a password or hashing value to 
        allow authentication of the reporting SLB. 
         
        The Service Count specifies the number of services/URLs returned by 
        this response. 
         
        Each service is described by its URL name, VIP address, application 
        protocol, transport protocol, port number, connection type and its 
        score.  These fields shall be repeated for each service returned.   
         
        The VIP Address is the virtual address used to access the service. 
         
        The Port Number specifies the port number used by the service. 
         
        The application protocol is defined in Section 5.11. 
         
        The Transport Protocol corresponds to the value specified by Internet 
        Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).  The information is necessary for 
        the SLB to properly perform health checks when requested and to 
        configure the proper interface.  The following is an example.

        The Connection Type specifies if the connection between the RS and 
        SLB is wired or wireless. 
         
                 Connection Type      Value 
                 Wired                    0

        The Service Score is calculated by the SLB for each supported 
        service.  The precise method used to calculate the score is left to 
        the implementation.  The range is 0 to 100.  See section 4.1 for a 
        description of the service score. 
         
        The URL Name is the text used to reference a specific service.  This 
        name is defined when the service registers.  Up to 255 ASCII 
        characters may be provided. 
         
        Each URL name can contain up to 255 characters. 
         
        The scope list is borrowed from Service Location Protocol Version 2, 
        RFC 2608.  This is an optional field that provides a list of scope 
        names that defines an administrative group that the service is 
        expecting to support.  Network and server performance monitor agents 
        that have been configured with any of the scopes will monitor the 
        performance of the services.  The service's scope list was provided 
        to the SLB appliance by the real server as part of the Service 
        Registration Request Message.  If this field is not part of the 
        message, the scope is considered to be the "DEFAULT" scope.  All 
        network and server performance agents will monitor services with a 
        "DEFAULT" scope, unless otherwise configured.  The scope list can 
        contain up to 255 characters.

        The New DNS Notification message shall be used to notify any locally 
        registered real servers that a new DNS server has attached to the 
        SLB.  This message is also used to notify locally registered users 
        when a local DNS has failed or removed itself from the network.  This

     5.17         GSLB DNS Notification Message 
         
        The GSLB DNS Notification Message informs the global server load 
        balancer of the existence of a DNS and allows the GSLB to associate 
        the DNS with specific network/server performance monitoring agents.  
        If the message is originated by the SLB, the Registered field shall 
        be set to one.  Also, this indicates that the second 4 bytes of the 
        message contains the VIP address of the DNS server.  In this case, 
        the message shall provide the GSLB with the VIP and real address of a 
        DNS that is registered to the SLB.   
         
        The message can be generated by a local DNS server that has not 
        registered with a SLB.  In this case, the Registered field shall be 
        set to zero.  The value of zero in this field indicates that the 
        second four bytes of the message is the IP address of the DNS∆s local 
        SLB and/or local network performance monitoring device. 
         
        The Active field specifies if the DNS is currently active and should 
        be added to the GSLB or if it should be removed.  A value of one 
        indicates active and zero indicates inactive.  
      
        This message is used by the GSLB to provide intelligent service 
        selection for clients.  The local SLB or network performance 
        monitoring device will be providing performance statistics to the 
        GSLB.  When a DNS request is received by the GSLB, this message 
        associates the DNS with network performance monitoring device.  For a 
        particular DNS, the GSLB will be able to map which SLB or local 
        network performance monitoring device statistics to use to provide an 
        intelligent server selection option.

     5.18          Anycast ARP (AARP) Request Message 
         
        The AARP Request Message shall be used to request address resolution 
        for a VIP address from an SLB.  The message can be addressed directly 
        to the SLB or to the VIP address being probed.  This message shall 
        request a list of unique IP addresses that identify real servers 
        supporting the requested VIP address, port, transport protocol, and 
        application protocol.  The port number helps to identify the service 
        provided.  The port number, transport protocol, and application 
        protocol identity are used as filters for this request.  A value of 0 
        within any of these fields indicates a wildcard request. 
         
        The Transport Protocol corresponds to the value specified by Internet 
        Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).  The following is an example. 
         
                 Transport Protocol         Value 
                 TCP                            6

        The Application Protocol defines the protocol being requested.  The 
        actual value to be used in the field shall be the port number being 
        used by the application protocol.  Some examples of the application 
        protocol values include 
         
                 Application Protocol       Value

     5.19          Anycast ARP Response Message 
         
        The AARP Response Message shall be sent by the SLB in response to an 
        address resolution request for a VIP.  This message shall contain a 
        list of real servers supporting the VIP/port/transport 
        protocol/application protocol and the service∆s score.   
         
        The Number of VIPs is equal to the number of VIPs reported within the 
        AARP response.  The VIP Address is the VIP supported by the SLB.  The 
        Service Count indicates the number of services supporting the 
        request.  For each service supported by a VIP, the application 
        protocol, port number and transport protocol is provided.  Following 
        this information will be the SLB score and the real server∆s unique 
        IP address. 
      
        The Score specifies the health score for the real server/service.  
        See section 4.1 for a discussion on the health score.  An example of 
        this message is illustrated below

        This section describes the operation of the protocol and its support 
        for GSLB.  The following diagram represents a simplified network 
        using the SLB and GSLB system.  The system contains two SLBs, each 
        managing two real servers.  In addition, each SLB has a local DNS.  
        The DNS functionality at each SLB improves reliability of the system. 
        The SLBs are attached to a Wide Area Network (WAN) that contains one 
        GSLB.  The GSLB is configured as authoritative for one or more unique 
        DNS zones.  Within the network there is a client and its local DNS 
        looking for a service within a GSLB zone.  Physically near the 
        client∆s DNS is a network/server performance monitoring device.  This 
        capability could be a separate appliance or an agent residing on a 
        computer or IP router.  The DNS will register with the GSLB and 
        provide the GSLB with the IP address of this local network/server 
        performance monitoring device.  This allows the GSLB to associate 
        measurement data from this performance monitoring station with 
        request from the client∆s DNS. 
         
        When a client requires a particular service, it asks the local DNS to 
        resolve the URL to a particular IP address.  If the service requested 
        is within GSLB DNS zone, the local DNS is configured to forward the 
        DNS request to the GSLB.  The GSLB is a DNS server that returns a 
        response that provides an IP address to the Ùbestˆ server available 
        for that particular client.  The definition of Ùbestˆ is determined 
        by the GSLB implementation.  It may be based on shortest distance, 
        lowest round trip time between the client network and server, least 
        connections, etc.

        The GSLB shall maintain a database of statistics that describes each 
        service in its domain.  There may be more than one GSLB within a 
        network.  The information is gathered by the GSLB(s) from each SLB 
        that has registered.  Local network and server performance monitoring 
        agents may be installed to gather information about the network 
        paths, link utilization, round trip times between local networks and 
        key server.  By subscribing to receive the SLB Service Information 
        Response the agents can dynamically learn what services can be 
        monitored.  Pre-configured scope-lists on network and server 
        performance monitoring agents will permit control over which service 
        an agent should monitor.  Access Control Lists can also be defined on 
        the agents to provide additional fine-tuned control of what services 
        are monitored.  The agents or devices shall report their service 
        monitoring and measurement findings to the GSLB.  The GSLB will 
        record this information and associate the information with the 
        appropriate local DNS servers. 
         
        Each SLB maintains the responsibility for monitoring its registered 
        real servers.  The SLB shall monitor the services provided by each 
        real server and generate a score for each service.  This score shall 
        be periodically sent to GSLB and other SLBs using an IP multicast 
        transmission.  The GSLB shall use this message to add, delete, or 
        update the service status in its database. In addition, the GSLB may 
        perform a unicast poll to obtain that latest information available 
        for a service from a SLB.  Since each SLB informs the GSLB of its 
        presence via a multicast message, a dynamically configuring system is 
        created.  As SLB appear within the network, it automatically 
        advertises its services to any GSLB that has connectivity to it.  If 
        an SLB gracefully shuts down, it shall inform the GSLB that it is no 
        longer in service and the GSLB shall remove all services supported by 
        the SLB from its database.  The GSLB shall also maintain staleness 
        statistics on services and SLBs.  If an entry for an SLB is 
        determined to be stale, the GSLB may poll the SLB to obtain the 
        latest information.  If the SLB does not respond, the SLB and any

        information provided by the SLB shall be removed from the GSLB 
        database. 
         
        When a real server joins the network, it shall register with an SLB.  
        This registration includes the URL name, VIP address, port number, 
        transport protocol, application protocol, and service scope list.  
        This combination of information uniquely defines the service.  The 
        VIP address may be obtained from a pool of addresses maintained by 
        the SLB or specified as a standard IP address.  The URL name is a 
        text string up to 255 characters.  If the URL is specified as an IP 
        address, the real server shall not participate in global balancing.  
        The service scope list helps to identify which network and server 
        monitoring agents should monitor the particular service.  In 
        addition, the registration process shall specify the type of 
        scheduling to use, type of health check to be performed by the SLB, 
        persistence, and connection capacity for this server.  To participate 
        in global server load balancing, the VIP address at each SLB for a 
        distributed service must be unique.  If the same VIP address is 
        allocated, the client will be provided one VIP address and it shall 
        be up to the network routers to determine the SLB selected. 
         
        After successfully registering its service, the RS shall begin 
        periodically transmitting a heartbeat to its SLB.  This message shall 
        be used to send the results of the RS health check to the SLB and for 
        the SLB to verify the operation of RS.  The SLB shall respond with an 
        acknowledgement to verify the operation of the SLB.  If there is no 
        acknowledgement, the RS shall drop the current connection and try to 
        establish a new connection with SLB.  After successful registration, 
        the SLB shall advertise the new VIP route to the rest of the network.  
        If the VIP is removed from the SLB, it shall also remove the route 
        from the network.  The service shall be advertised to the GSLB along 
        with its score.  The service shall be removed from the GSLB when 
        there are no longer any real servers providing the service. 
         
        To support the operation of the real servers that have local DNS 
        capability, the SLB shall notify each real server it manages when a 
        local DNS has attached.  This provides a method to dynamically 
        maintain the real server∆s DNS configuration, thus adding to the 
        plug-and-play capability. 
         
        In addition to managing SLBs and real servers, this protocol also 
        supports address resolution using the Anycast ARP (AARP) to obtain 
        the unique IP address of a real server for a particular service.  Two 
        types of AARPs are supported.  The first provides a method to request 
        the real servers supporting a service at a particular SLB.  A request 
        can be sent to an SLB∆s WAN address or VIP address to obtain a list 
        of servers that support a VIP, port number, transport protocol and 
        application protocol.  Wild cards for the port number and transport 
        protocol may be provided to return a list of all real servers.  The

        SLB shall send an AARP response message containing the list of real 
        servers meeting the requested criteria.  Each real server is 
        described by the IP address, port number, transport protocol, 
        application protocol and service score.  The second AARP request can 
        be sent to the GSLB.  This AARP requests a list of SLBs that support 
        a particular service/URL.  The response shall contain the SLB WAN 
        address, VIP address, and service score.  Based on this response, the 
        client shall select an SLB and then issue the previous reference AARP 
        request to obtain a list of real servers.  The destination of this 
        AARP can be the SLB IP address. 
         
     6.1         Real Server Registration Process 
         
        The real server announces its presence via the registration process.  
        After successful registration, the SLB shall initiate management of 
        the real server.  This must be the first operation performed by the 
        real server.  The RS shall issue a Real Server Registration Request 
        to its selected SLB, which is usually its default router, and waits 
        for the Real Server Registration Response.  The response shall 
        provide information about the SLB∆s configuration and status of the 
        request.  If successful, the real server shall continue.  If not, the 
        real server may try again. 
      
      
      
     6.2         VIP Address Request  
         
        Each service shall be known via a name and a VIP address.    This 
        information can be supplied by the SLB to the GSLB.  Based on this 
        information the GSLB can provide a user with one or more suppliers of 
        a service.  Each SLB maintains a database of static and dynamic VIP 
        addresses.  The VIP address pool and any static entries shall be 
        configurable.  The VIP addresses and names provided by to the GSLB 
        should be unique within the zone supported by the GSLB. The real 
        server shall obtain a VIP for a service using this VIP request.  The 
        VIP response shall provide the VIP to the real server.  If the real 
        server is providing a service that is associated with a static IP 
        address, the real server should not request a VIP address.   
         
     6.3         Service Registration 
         
        After obtaining a VIP address, or using a static VIP address supplied 
        by the real server, the real server shall register the service with 
        the SLB.  Each real server may register one or more services. The 
        service registration supplies all the information to configure the 
        SLB.  The success of this operation shall be returned via an 
        acknowledgement.  Upon successful registration, the SLB shall 
        advertise the VIP by injecting the VIP address into a routing 
        protocol (e.g. OSPF).  The SLB shall then route users to this real

        server based on the service∆s configuration and health.  Users can 
        then access the real server using the VIP address.   The VIP address 
        and URL are advertised to the Global Server Load Balancer after 
        successful registration.  Subsequent registrations by additional real 
        servers for the same service shall use the same VIP address for the 
        service. 
         
     6.4         Service Deletion 
         
        To delete a service from the SLB, a real server shall send the 
        Service Delete message.  The SLB shall remove the real server from 
        its supervision.  If no more real servers are supporting the VIP, the 
        SLB shall remove the VIP address from its management and informs the 
        GSLB that the service is no longer available from this SLB. 
         
     6.5         Shutdown 
         
        This process informs the SLB, GSLB, or RS that an entity that it is 
        connected to is terminating.  For example, if an RS terminates it 
        shall send a shutdown message to its parent SLB.  All services 
        supported by this real server shall be removed from the SLB.  If no 
        more real servers are supporting the VIP, the SLB shall remove the 
        VIP from its management and informs the GSLB that the service is no 
        longer available from this SLB. 
         
        If an SLB is terminating, it shall send shutdown messages to its RSs 
        and GSLBs. This provides an orderly shutdown of the system.  No 
        responses are required. 
         
     6.6         Real Server DNS Update 
         
        Update the DNS registered with the SLB with information describing a 
        real server also attached to this SLB.  This shall provide access to 
        the real servers from other points in the network.  When this real 
        server is removed the DNS entry shall also be removed.  This may be 
        done using the Dynamic DNS Update Protocol document in RFC 2136. 
         
     6.7         DNS Update 
         
        Inform a real server connected to the SLB that a new DNS service has 
        been added to this SLB.  Since the real server∆s DNS entry has been 
        supplied by DHCP, the real server should renew its IP configuration 
        upon receipt of this message.  The real server shall receive a DNS 
        Update Request to initiate the processing.  No acknowledgement shall 
        be required.

     Draft                           SLBRP                   November 2003 
      
      
        Inform the GSLB and other SLBs that a new service has been added to 
        an SLB.  This shall be a periodic multicast message.  As long as the 
        service exists, the SLB shall send the message.  If it is no longer 
        supported, the SLB shall send one last message informing the network 
        that the service is no longer provided by the SLB. 
         
     6.9 Scope List 
      
        The scope list is identical to the scope list defined within the 
        Service Location Protocol, Version 2.  User defined scopes can be 
        phased into existence based upon the requirements of the network.  
        The scope list is optional.  All services that are not configured 
        with a scope are automatically made part of the network's "DEFAULT" 
        scope.  All network and server performance monitor agents will 
        monitor servers and services with a default scope unless specifically 
        configured not to.  A service can be configured with multiple scopes. 
        Server and network monitor agents can also be configured with 
        multiple scopes.  These configured scopes do not have to include the 
        "DEFAULT" scope. 
      
      
      
     7.0  Protocol Timers 
      
       The configuration of the protocol timers used will impact the ability 
       to provide the best value.  The following timers can be configured by 
       the administrator to optimize performance.  Default values are 
       provided to permit a starting point for system optimization.  The 
       configuration of these timers must consider the number of SLBs, 
       GSLBs, and services active within the enterprise network. 
        
        
       Description                       Default Timer Value   Configurable 
       --------------------------------  -------------------   ------------ 
       Real Server Heartbeat Timer            60 Seconds       Yes 
       SLB RS Service Health Check           300 Seconds       Yes 
       RS SLB Health Detection               300 Seconds       Yes 
       GSLB Service Update Notification      300 Seconds       Yes 
       GSLB SLB Health Detection             900 Seconds       Yes 
       GSLB Stale Database                    60 Seconds       Yes 
       VIP Address and Service Hold Time    1200 Seconds       Yes

     8.0  IPv6 Support 
         
        To support IPv6 the address fields within the messages exchanged 
        between the RS, SLB, and GSLB must be updated to support the longer

        length of these fields.  To support IPv6 anycast, the protocol 
        implementation should adhere to the anycast addressing restrictions 
        defined in RFC 3513.  IPv6 Anycast addresses used by the protocol 
        must adhere to those reserved by RFC 2526.  The DNS servers and GSLB 
        must support IPV6 DNS requirements as documented in RFC 2874 and 
        discussed in RFC 3363. 
      
      
     9.0  Security Considerations 
         
        Since the system described within this document provides automatic 
        configuration and update of the network infrastructure and 
        environment it is critical to provide a level of security that is 
        equal to the environment being supported.  Security constraints 
        include those associated with Dynamic DNS updates and support for 
        anycast services. 
         
        SLB applications can provide additional security by controlling who 
        can access servers and by monitoring the types of requests delivered 
        to servers.  For instance, SLB devices have the potential to detect 
        and help prevent HTTP-based worm proliferation and generic TCP and 
        HTTPS denial of service attacks.  Security can be also enhanced 
        through implementation of a variety of well known techniques and best 
        practices.  This includes the use of authentication protocols and 
        access control lists to help ensure that only well known trusted 
        servers are allowed to register with the system.  Message Digests can 
        be used to help with authentication of messages exchanged between 
        SLBs and GSLBs. 
         
        The protocol timer configurations must be configured to allow 
        efficient operation without consuming an over abundance of network 
        bandwidth.
