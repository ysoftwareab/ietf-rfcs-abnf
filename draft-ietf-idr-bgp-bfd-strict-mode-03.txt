                 draft-ietf-idr-bgp-bfd-strict-mode-03

Abstract

   This document specifies extensions to RFC4271 BGP-4 that enable a BGP
   speaker to negotiate additional Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
   (BFD) extensions using a BGP capability.  This BFD capability enables
   a BGP speaker to prevent a BGP session from being established until a
   BFD session is established.  It is referred to as BGP BFD "strict-
   mode".  BGP BFD strict-mode will be supported when both the local
   speaker and its remote peer are BFD strict-mode capable.

1.  Introduction

   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection BFD [RFC5882] enables routers to
   monitor data plane connectivity and to detect faults in the
   bidirectional forwarding path between them.  This capability is
   leveraged by routing protocols such as BGP [RFC4271] to rapidly react
   to topology changes in the face of path failures.

   The BFD interaction with BGP is specified in Section 10.2 of
   [RFC5882].  When BFD is enabled for a BGP neighbor, faults in the
   bidirectional forwarding detected by BFD result in session
   termination.  It is possible in some failure scenarios for the
   network to be in a state such that a BGP session may be established
   but a BFD session cannot be established.  In some other scenarios, it
   may be possible to establish a BGP session, but a degraded or poor-
   quality link may result in the corresponding BFD session going up and
   down frequently.

   To avoid situations which result in routing churn and to minimize the
   impact of network interruptions, it will be beneficial to disallow
   BGP to establish a session until BFD session is successfully
   established and has stabilized.  We refer to this mode of operation
   as BGP BFD "strict-mode".  However, always using "strict-mode" would
   preclude BGP operation in an environment where not all routers
   support BFD strict-mode or have BFD enabled.  This document defines
   BGP "strict-mode" operation as preventing BGP session establishment
   until both the local and remove speakers have a stable BFD session.

   The document also specifies the BGP protocol extensions for BGP
   capability [RFC5492] for announcing BFD parameters including a BGP
   speaker's support for "strict-mode", i.e., requiring a BFD session
   for BGP session establishment.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  BFD Strict-Mode Capability

   The BGP Strict-Mode Capability [RFC5492] will allow a BGP speaker's
   to advertise this capability.  The capability is defined as follows:

   Capability code: TBD

   Capability length: 0 octets

4.  Operation

   A BGP speaker which supports capabilities advertisement and has BFD
   strict-mode enabled MUST include the BFD strict-mode capability.

   A BGP speaker which supports the BFD Strict-Mode capability, examines
   the list of capabilities present in the capabilities that the speaker
   receives from its peer.  If both the local and remote BGP speakers
   include the BFD strict-mode capability, the BGP finite state machine
   does not transition to the Established state from OpenSent or
   OpenConfirm state [RFC4271] until the BFD session is in the Up state
   (see below for AdminDown state).  This means that a KEEPALIVE message
   is not sent nor is the KeepaliveTimer set.

   If the BFD session does not transition to the Up state, and the
   HoldTimer has been negotiated to a non-zero value, the BGP FSM will
   close the session appropriately.  If the HoldTimer has been
   negotiated to a zero value, the session should be closed after a time
   of X.  This time X is referred as "BGP BFD Hold time".  The proposed
   default BGP BFD Hold time value is 30 seconds.  The BGP BFD Hold time
   value is configurable.

   If BFD session is in the AdminDown state, then the BGP finite state
   machine will proceed normally without input from BFD.  This means
   that BFD session "AdminDown" state WILL NOT prevent the BGP state
   transition to Established state from OpenConfirm.

   Once the BFD session has transitioned to the Up state, the BGP FSM
   may proceed to transition to the Established state from the OpenSent
   or OpenConfirm state appropriately.  I.e. a KEEPALIVE message is
   sent, and the KeepaliveTimer is started.

   If either BGP peer has not advertised the BFD Strict-Mode Capability,
   then a BFD session WILL NOT be required for the BGP session to reach
   Established state.  This does not preclude usage of BFD after BGP
   session establishment [RFC5882].

   If BFD is disabled for a BGP peer and the BGP session state is being
   held in OpenSent or OpenConfirm state, then the BGP will close
   session, and start a new TCP connect.

5.  Manageability Considerations

   Auto-configuration is possible for the enabling BGP BFD Strict-Mode.
   However, the configuration automation is out of the scope of this
   document.

   A BGP NOTIFICATION message Subcode indicating BFD Hold timer
   expiration may be required for network management.  (To be discussed
   in the next revision of this document.)

6.  Security Considerations

   The mechanism defined in this document interacts with the BGP finite
   state machine when so configured.  The security considerations of BFD
   thus, become considerations for BGP-4 [RFC4271] so used.  Given that
   a BFD session is required for a BGP session, a Denial-of-Service
   (DoS) attack on BGP can now be mounted by preventing a BFD session
   between the BGP peers from being established or interrupting an
   existing BFD session.  The use of the BFD Authentication mechanism
   defined in [RFC5880] is thus RECOMMENDED when used to protect BGP-4
   [RFC4271].

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new BGP capability - BFD Capability.  The
   Capability Code for BFD Capability is TBD.
