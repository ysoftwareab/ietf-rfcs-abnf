                BGP Extended Community Registries Update
                 draft-ietf-idr-bgp-ext-com-registry-01

Abstract

   This document updates several BGP Extended Community registries in
   order to replace the "Experimental Use" registration procedure in
   some entries, since their use is clearly not experimental and thus
   misleading.

   This document updates RFC7153.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7153] reorganizes the IANA registries for the type values and
   sub-type values of the BGP Extended Communities attribute.  As a
   result the IANA maintained registry entitled "BGP Transitive Extended
   Community Types" includes a range of Type Values (0x80-0x8F) with
   Experimental Use registration procedure.  Out of this experimental
   range the types 0x80, 0x81, 0x82 have been assigned via [RFC5575] and
   [RFC7674].  The primary use for those types and sub-type registries
   is non experimental.

   Section 2 of this document requests the registry cleanup to reflect
   the actual use of those code-points (removing "Experimental Use" from
   the sub-type registry names) and changes the registration procedure
   of the types 0x80, 0x81, 0x82 to first come first serve.

Internet-Draft       BGP Ext. Com. Registries Update        January 2021


2.1.  Registry: BGP Transitive Extended Community Types

   IANA maintains a registry entitled "BGP Transitive Extended Community
   Types".  IANA is requested to update the Name of the Type Values
   according to Table 1 and append a reference to this document to the
   existing references.

   +=======+==============================================+===========+
   | Type  | Name                                         | Reference |
   | Value |                                              |           |
   +=======+==============================================+===========+
   | 0x80  | Generic Transitive Extended Community (Sub-  | [add this |
   |       | Types are defined in the "Generic Transitive | document] |
   |       | Extended Community Sub-Types" Registry)      |           |
   +-------+----------------------------------------------+-----------+
   | 0x81  | Generic Transitive Extended Community Part 2 | [add this |
   |       | (Sub-Types are defined in the "Generic       | document] |
   |       | Transitive Extended Community Part 2 Sub-    |           |
   |       | Types" Registry)                             |           |
   +-------+----------------------------------------------+-----------+
   | 0x82  | Generic Transitive Extended Community Part 3 | [add this |
   |       | (Sub-Types are defined in the "Generic       | document] |
   |       | Transitive Extended Community Part 3 Sub-    |           |
   |       | Types" Registry)                             |           |
   +-------+----------------------------------------------+-----------+

        Table 1: Registry: BGP Transitive Extended Community Types

   Furthermore IANA is requested to change the registration procedures
   of this registry of Type Values 0x80 thru 0x82 to First Come First
   Serve.  The resulting Registration Procedures should read as in
   Table 2.

       +===========+===============================================+
       | Range     | Registration Procedures                       |
       +===========+===============================================+
       | 0x00-0x3f | First Come First Served                       |
       +-----------+-----------------------------------------------+
       | 0x80-0x82 | First Come First Served (see [this document]) |
       +-----------+-----------------------------------------------+
       | 0x83-0x8f | Reserved for Experimental Use (see [RFC3692]) |
       +-----------+-----------------------------------------------+
       | 0x90-0xbf | Standards Action                              |
       +-----------+-----------------------------------------------+

2.2.  Registry: Generic Transitive Experimental Use Extended Community
      Sub-Types
