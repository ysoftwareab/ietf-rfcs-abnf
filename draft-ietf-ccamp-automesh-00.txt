         The set up of a full mesh of MPLS TE LSPs among a set of Label Switch 
         Router (LSR) is common deployment scenario of MPLS Traffic 
         Engineering either for bandwidth optimization, bandwidth guarantees

         or fast rerouting with MPLS Fast Reroute. Such deployment requires 
         the configuration of potentially a large number of TE LSPs (on the 
         order of the square of the number LSRs). This document specifies IGP 
         (OSPF and IS-IS) traffic engineering extensions so as to provide an 
         automatic discovery of the set of LSRs members of a mesh, leading to 
         an automatic mechanism to set up TE LSP mesh(es) (also referred to as 
         a mesh-group in this document).

      3. Introduction 
       
         As of today, there are different approaches in deploying MPLS Traffic  
         Engineering:  
          
         (1) The 'systematic' approach consisting of setting up a full  
             mesh of TE LSPs between a set of LSRs,  
          
         (2) The 'by exception' approach whereby a set of TE LSPs are  
             provisioned on hot spots to alleviate a congestion resulting  
             for instance from an unexpected traffic growth in some part  
             of the network.   
          
         The set up of a full mesh of MPLS TE LSPs among a set of LSRs is a 
         common deployment scenario of MPLS Traffic Engineering either for 
         bandwidth optimization, bandwidth guarantees or fast rerouting with 
         MPLS Fast Reroute ([FRR]). Setting up a full mesh of TE LSPs between 
         a set of LSRs requires the configuration of a potentially large 
       
      Vasseur, Le Roux et al.                                       [Page 3] 
        

      Internet Draft     draft-ietf-ccamp-automesh-00      November 2005 


         number of TE LSPs on every head-end LSR. The resulting total number 
         of TE LSP in a full TE mesh of n LSRs is O(n^2). Furthermore, the 
         addition of any new LSR in the mesh requires the configuration of n 
         additional TE LSPs on the new LSR and one new TE LSP on every LSR of 
         the existing mesh terminating to this new LSR, which gives a total of 
         2*n TE LSPs. Such operation is not only time consuming but also a 
         risky operation for Service Providers. Hence, a more automatic 
         mechanism to setting up one or more full meshes of TE LSPs is 
         desirable and requires the ability to automatically discover the LSRs 
         that belong to the mesh. 
          
         MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) routing ([IS-IS-TE], [OSPF-TE]) 
         relies on extensions to link state IGP routing protocols ([OSPF], 
         [IS-IS]) in order to carry Traffic Engineering link information used 
         for constraint based routing. Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) related 
         routing extensions are defined in [IS-IS-G] and [OSPF-G].  
          
         Further routing extensions have been defined in [OSPF-CAPS] and [IS-
         IS-CAPS] so as to advertise router capabilities. This document 
         specifies IGP (OSPF and IS-IS) traffic engineering capability TLVs in 
         order to provide a mechanism to automatically discover the LSR 
         members of a mesh, leading to an automatic mechanism to set up TE LSP 
         mesh (also referred to as a mesh-group in this document) in a 
         network. The routing extensions specified in this document provide 
         the ability to signal multiple TE meshes whereby an LSR can belong to 
         one or more TE meshes. 
          
      4. TE mesh-group  
       
         4.1. Description 
       
         A TE mesh-group is defined as a group of LSRs that are connected by a 
         full mesh of TE LSPs. It is useful to dynamically advertise the 
         desire of a node to join/leave a particular TE mesh-group. This 
         allows for an automatic provisioning of a full mesh of TE LSPs, and 
         thus drastically reduces the configuration overhead and risk of mis-
         configuration. 
       
         4.2. Required Information 
          
         This document specifies a TE-MESH-GROUP TLV that indicates the set of 
         TE mesh-group(s) an LSR belongs to. For each TE mesh group announced 
         by the LSR, the TE-MESH-GROUP TLV carries the following information: 
              -A mesh-group number identifying the TE mesh-group, 
              -A Tail-end address (address used as a tail end address by other 
              LSRs belonging to the same mesh-group), 
              -A Tail-end name: string used to ease the TE-LSP naming (e.g. 
              'head-name->tail-name').

         5.1. OSPF TE-MESH-GROUP TLV format 
          
         The OSPF TE-MESH-GROUP TLV (carried in an OSPF router information LSA 
         as defined in [OSPF-CAP]) has the following format:   
              
           0                   1                   2                   3

           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
           |                                                               |  
           //                            Value                            //         
           |                                                               |  
           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
              
                              OSPF TE-MESH-GROUP TLV format 
         Where   
            Type: identifies the TLV type  
            Length: length of the value field in octets  
              
         The format of the OSPF TE-MESH-GROUP TLV is the same as the TLV 
         format used by the Traffic Engineering Extensions to OSPF [OSPF-TE]. 
         The TLV is padded to four-octet alignment; padding is not included in 
         the length field (so a three octet value would have a length of 
         three, but the total size of the TLV would be eight octets).  Nested 
         TLVs are also 32-bit aligned.  Unrecognized types are ignored.  All 
         types between 32768 and 65535 are reserved for vendor-specific 
         extensions.  All other undefined type codes are reserved for future 
         assignment by IANA.  
              
         The TE-MESH-GROUP TLV is used to advertise the desire to  
         join/leave a given MPLS TE mesh group. No sub-TLV is currently 
         defined for the TE-mesh-group TLV.   
          
         The TE-MESH-GROUP TLV has the following format:  
              
            CODE: 3  
            LENGTH: Variable (N*12 octets)

            N is the number of mesh-groups.  
              
         For each TE mesh group announced by the LSR, the TE-MESH-GROUP TLV 
         contains:  
            - A mesh-group-number: identifies the mesh-group number,  
            - A Tail-end address: user configurable IP address to be used as a  
            tail-end address by other LSRs belonging to the same mesh-group.  
            - A Tail-end name: 32-bits string which facilitates the TE LSP  
            identification which can be very useful in some environments such   
            as inter-area/AS MPLS TE environments.  
          
         5.2. IS-IS TE-MESH-GROUP TLV format 
          
         The IS-IS TE-MESH-GROUP TLV is composed of 1 octet for the type, 1 
         octet specifying the TLV length and a value field.  
              
         The format of the TE-MESH-GROUP TLV is identical to the TLV format 
         used by the Traffic Engineering Extensions to IS-IS [IS-IS-TE].  
          
         The TE-MESH-GROUP TLV is used to advertise the desire to join/leave a 
         given TE mesh group. No sub-TLV is currently defined for the TE-MESH-
         GROUP TLV. 
          
         The TE-MESH-GROUP TLV has the following format:  
              
            CODE: 2  
            LENGTH: Variable (N*12 octets)

                                    TE-MESH-GROUP TLV format  
              
            N is the number of mesh-groups.  
              
         For each Mesh-group announced by an LSR, the TLV contains:  
            - A mesh-group-number: identifies the mesh-group number,  
            - A Tail-end address: user configurable IP address to be used as a  
            tail-end address by other LSRs belonging to the same mesh-group.  
            - A Tail-end name: 32-bits string which facilitates the TE LSP  
            identification which can be very useful in inter-area/AS MPLS TE  
            environments.

      Internet Draft     draft-ietf-ccamp-automesh-00      November 2005 


      6. Elements of procedure 
          
         The TE-MESH-GROUP TLV is carried in Link State Advertisements (LSA) 
         and Router capability TLV (carried itself within a Link State Packet 
         (LSP)) for OSPF and ISIS respectively. As such, elements of 
         procedures are inherited from those defined in [OSPF-CAPS] and [IS-
         IS-CAPS]. Specifically, a router MUST originate a new LSA/LSP 
         whenever the content of this information changes, or whenever 
         required by regular routing procedure (e.g. refresh).  
          
         The TE-MESH-GROUP TLV is OPTIONAL. 
          
         6.1. OSPF 
          
         The TE-MESH-GROUP TLV is carried within an OSPF router information 
         opaque LSA (opaque type of 4, opaque ID of 0) as defined in [OSPF-
         CAP].  
              
         A router MUST originate a new OSPF router information LSA whenever  
         the content of the any of the carried TLV changes or whenever  
         required by the regular OSPF procedure (LSA refresh (every  
         LSRefreshTime)).  
              
         As defined in RFC2370, an opaque LSA has a flooding scope determined  
         by its LSA type:  
               - link-local (type 9),   
               - area-local (type 10)   
               - entire OSPF routing domain (type 11). In this case, the  
               flooding scope is equivalent to the Type 5 LSA flooding scope.  
              
         A router may generate multiple OSPF router information LSAs with  
         different flooding scopes. 
          
         The TE-MESH-GROUP TLV may be carried within a type 10 or 11 router  
         information LSA depending on the MPLS TE mesh group profile:  
              
             - If the MPLS TE mesh-group is contained within a single area  
               (all the LSRs have their head-end and tail-end LSR within the  
               same OSPF area), the TE-MESH-GROUP TLV MUST be generated    
               within a Type 10 router information LSA,  
             - If the MPLS TE mesh-group spans multiple OSPF areas, the TE 
               mesh-group TLV MUST be generated within a Type 11 router  
               information LSA,  
          
         6.2. IS-IS 
          
         The TE-MESH-GROUP TLV is carried within the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY 
         TLV defined in [IS-IS-CAP].  
              
         An IS-IS router MUST originate a new IS-IS LSP whenever the content  
         of the any of the carried sub-TLV changes or whenever required by the  
         regular IS-IS procedure (LSP refresh).  
       
      Vasseur, Le Roux et al.                                       [Page 7] 
        

      Internet Draft     draft-ietf-ccamp-automesh-00      November 2005 


              
         If the flooding scope of an MPLS Traffic Engineering capability is  
         limited to an IS-IS level/area, the TLV MUST not be leaked across 
         level/area and the S flag of the Router CAPABILITY TLV MUST be 
         cleared. Conversely, if the flooding scope of an MPLS Traffic 
         Engineering capability is the entire routing domain, the TLV MUST be 
         leaked across levels for IS-IS the S flag of the CAPABILITY TLV MUST 
         be set.  
              
         In both cases the flooding rules as specified in [IS-IS-CAP] apply.  
              
         As specified in [IS-IS-CAP], a router may generate multiple IS-IS  
         CAPABILITY TLVs within an IS-IS LSP with different flooding scopes.  
           
      7. Backward compatibility 
          
         The TE-MESH-GROUP TLVs defined in this document do not introduce any  
         interoperability issue. For OSPF, a router not supporting the TE-
         MESH-GROUP TLV SHOULD just silently ignore the TLV as specified in 
         RFC2370. For IS-IS a router not supporting the TE-MESH-GROUP TLV 
         SHOULD just silently ignore the TLV. 
          
      8. Security Considerations 
       
         No new security issues are raised in this document. 
          
      9. Intellectual Property Statement

         Intellectual Property Rights or other rights that might be claimed to
