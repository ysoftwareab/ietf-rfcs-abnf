Abstract

    This document proposes the addition of new cipher suites to the
    Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to support the Camellia
    encryption algorithm as a bulk cipher algorithm.


1. Introduction

    This document proposes the addition of new cipher suites to the TLS
    protocol [TLS] to support the Camellia encryption algorithm as a bulk
    cipher algorithm.  This proposal provides a new option for fast,
    efficient, and royalty-free bulk cipher algorithms.

    Camellia is a 128-bit block cipher with 128-, 192-, and 256-bit key
    sizes, i.e. it supports the same block and key sizes as the Advanced
    Encryption Standard (AES).  A description of the Camellia cipher
    algorithm is in [CamelliaSpec][CamelliaTech].

    Efficiency on both software and hardware platforms is a remarkable
    characteristic of Camellia.  In particular, Camellia's small
    hardware design is suitable for mobile, portable and low power
    applications.  Furthermore, Camellia has withstood extensive
    cryptanalytic efforts in several open, worldwide cryptographic
    evaluation projects.


2. Proposed Cipher Suites

    The new ciphersuites proposed here have the following definitions:

    CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA      = { 0x00,0x41 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA   = { 0x00,0x42 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA   = { 0x00,0x43 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA  = { 0x00,0x44 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA  = { 0x00,0x45 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA  = { 0x00,0x46 };

    CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA      = { 0x00,0x47 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA   = { 0x00,0x48 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA   = { 0x00,0x49 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA  = { 0x00,0x4A };
    CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA  = { 0x00,0x4B };
    CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA  = { 0x00,0x4C };

    Note: The above numeric definitions for Cipher Suites have not yet
    been registered.  


3. CipherSuite Definitions

3.1 Cipher

    All the ciphersuites described here use Camellia in cipher block
    chaining (CBC) mode as a bulk cipher algorithm.  Camellia is a
    128-bit block cipher with 128-, 192-, and 256-bit key sizes, i.e. it
    supports the same block and key sizes as the Advanced Encryption
    Standard (AES).  However, this document only defines ciphersuites
    for 128- and 256-bit keys as well as AES ciphersuites for TLS [AES].
    They are enough for use in efficient and practical cases as well as
    high-security applications.

    Cipher           Type  Material Key Material  Key Bits  Size  Size

    CAMELLIA_128_CBC Block   16         16         128       16    16
    CAMELLIA_256_CBC Block   32         32         256       16    16

3.2 Hash

    All the ciphersuites described here use SHA-1 in an HMAC
    construction as described in section 5 of [TLS], a modified SHA-1
    version of the algorithm.

3.3 Key exchange

    The ciphersuites defined here differ in the type of certificate and
    key exchange method.  They use the following options:

    CipherSuite                               Key Exchange Algorithm
             
    TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA         RSA      
    TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA      DH_DSS   
    TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA      DH_RSA   
    TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA     DHE_DSS  
    TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA     DHE_RSA  
    TLS_DH_anon_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA     DH_anon  

    TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA         RSA      
    TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA      DH_DSS   
    TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA      DH_RSA   
    TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA     DHE_DSS  
    TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA     DHE_RSA  
    TLS_DH_anon_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA     DH_anon  

    For the meanings of the terms RSA, DH_DSS, DH_RSA, DHE_DSS, DHE_RSA
    and DH_anon, please refer to sections 7.4.2 and 7.4.3 of [TLS].


4. Security Considerations 

    It is not believed that the new ciphersuites are ever less secure
    than the corresponding older ones.  Camellia is believed to be
    secure, and it has withstood extensive cryptanalytic efforts in
    several open, worldwide cryptographic evaluation projects.

    For other security considerations, please refer to the security
    considerations of the corresponding older ciphersuites described
    in [TLS] and [AES].


5. Intellectual Property 

    Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (Mitsubishi Electric) and Nippon
    Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) have pending applications
    or filed patents which are essential to Camellia.  License policy
    for these essential patents declared formally by NTT and Mitsubishi
    Electric is available on the IETF page of Intellectual Property
    Rights Notices.
