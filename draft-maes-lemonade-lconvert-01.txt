Abstract 
    
   LCONVERT defines extensions to the IMAPv4 Rev1 protocol [RFC3501] for 
   optimization in a mobile setting, aimed at allowing adaptation and 
   transcoding of attachments as needed by the client. Conversion 
   (adaptation, transcoding) may be requested by the client and 
   performed by the server on a best effort basis or decided by the 
   server based on its knowledge of the client capabilities, user or 
   administrator preferences or its settings.

1.    Introduction 
    
   LCONVERT is based on IMAPv4 Rev1 [RFC3501]. It defines additional 
   enhancements for optimization in a mobile setting: extensions to the 
   IMAPv4 Rev1 protocol [RFC3501] that allows adaptation and transcoding

   of body parts as needed by the client. Conversion (adaptation, 
   transcoding) may be requested by the client and performed by the 
   server on a best effort basis or decided by the server based on its 
   knowledge of the client capabilities, user or administrator 
   preferences or its settings.  
    
   These are important features required in particular to support mobile 
   email use cases [MEMAIL], [OMA-ME-RD]. 
    
   A server that supports LCONVERT can convert leaf body parts to other 
   formats to be viewed on a mobile device. The client can explicitly 
   request a particular conversion. The server complies on a best effort 
   basis. When not possible, the server determines based on its own 
   strategy (e.g. based on knowledge of the client as discussed 
   hereafter) how to convert. If the server knows the characteristics of 
   the device or can determine them (out of scope of LCONVERT), the 
   attachments can also be optimized for the capabilities of the devices 
   (e.g. form factor of pictures). See discussion in Appendix B. This is 
   a recommended server behavior. 
      
2.   Relation with other E-mail specifications 
    
   The Lemonade Profile [LEMONADEPROFILE] specifies the Lemonade Pull 
   Model that governs the exchanges among mail servers or between 
   desktop mail client and mail servers. Lemonade investigates adding 
   mobile optimizations for the next version of the profile. 
    
   LCONVERT should be seen as a way to address the issues of mobile 
   optimization and an input to the Lemonade Profile work. It addresses 
   the topic of attachment conversions identified by the Lemonade work 
   as critical for mobile email.  
    
   LCONVERT does not address conversion and streaming of media as also 
   identified of interest by lemonade. This has not been identified as 
   relevant to mobile e-mail [MEMAIL] and [OMA-ME-RD]. 
    
   Clients and servers MAY support other Lemonade extensions and 
   behaviors. 
    
   This document assumes that clients MUST be compliant to LCONVERT when 
   it decides to use this extension. The server that claims support of 
   LCONVERT MUST be compliant to LCONVERT for its exchanges with the 
   mobile client.  
    
3.   Interactions between the Client and Server when supporting LCONVERT 
    
   A compliant server must support all IMAPv4Rev1 commands from client 
   devices following the syntax defined in [RFC3501].  Thus, a client 
   may issue any existing IMAP commands to the server, and both the

   server and client must behave as specified in [RFC3501].  In 
   addition, the client and server SHOULD support the IMAP Binary 
   specification [RFC3516]. 
 
4.   The CAPABILITY Command 
    
   The CAPABILITY command is defined in RFC3501, section 6.1.1.  The 
   client sends a CAPABILITY command so it can query the server to find 
   out what commands it supports.  In RFC3501, the IMAP server is 
   allowed to specify additional capabilities not included in that 
   specification.  A server that supports LCONVERT and its requirements 
   MUST list that it supports LCONVERT.   
 
   A server can also enumerate individually the other commands that it 
   supports.  
    
   capability_cmd =  tag SP "CAPABILITY"  
   Valid States:  NOT AUTHENTICATED, AUTHENTICATED, SELECTED, or LOGOUT 
   Responses:  REQUIRED untagged response: CAPABILITY 
   Result:  OK - capability completed 
      BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid 
    
   Example: A server that implements LDELIVER.  
      C: a001 CAPABILITY 
      S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 AUTH=LOGIN IDLE LCONVERT BINARY 
      S: a001 OK CAPABILITY completed 
 
5.   LCONVERT BODY and BINARY data item extension 
    
   LCONVERT is a FETCH extension used to transcode the media type of a 
   leaf MIME part into another media type, and/or the same media type, 
   with different encoding parameters. It adds new options to the 
   section-spec part of the BODY data item, a new FETCH response data 
   item BODYPARTSTRUCTURE, and new response codes. It is also expected 
   to work with IMAP BINARY data item extension, whose grammar is 
   modified as well. 
    
   LCONVERTÆs syntax is modeled after the HEADER.FIELDS syntax in 
   RFC3501, and is generally structured as: 
    
   BODY[section-part.LCONVERT (ômedia typeö ôsubtypeö (parameters))] 
    
   BODY.PEEK[section-part.LCONVERT (ômedia typeö ôsubtypeö 
   (parameters))]<partial> 
    
   BINARY[section-part.LCONVERT (ômedia typeö ôsubtypeö 
   (parameters))]<partial>

                              <LCONVERT>                     July 2005 
 
 
   BINARY.PEEK[section-part.LCONVERT (ômedia typeö ôsubtypeö 
   (parameters))]<partial> 
    
   BINARY.SIZE[section-part.LCONVERT (ômedia typeö ôsubtypeö 
   (parameters))]<partial> 
    
    
   Example:  The client fetches body part section 3 in the message with 
   the message sequence number of 2 and asks to have that attachment 
   converted to pdf format.   
    
      C: a001 FETCH 2 BODY[3.LCONVERT (ôAPPLICATIONö ôPDFö)] 
      S: * 2 FETCH (BODYPARTSTRUCTURE[3] ("APPLICATION" "PDF" () NIL  
         NIL "Base64" 2135 NIL NIL NIL) BODY[3] {2135} 
         <the document in .pdf format> 
         ) 
      S: a001 OK FETCH COMPLETED 
 
   Example:  The client requests for conversion of a text/html section 
   as text/plain and asks for a charset of us-ascii.  The server cannot 
   respect the charset request because there are non-us-ascii characters 
   in the html code.  Thus, in the untagged response, the server returns 
   the charset of UTF-8 and utilizes a content transfer encoding capable 
   of representing the full 8-bit range, along with the converted text. 
    
      C: a001 FETCH 2 BODY[3.LCONVERT (ôtextö ôplainö (ôcharsetö ôus-
   asciiö))] 
      S: * 2 FETCH (BODYPARTSTRUCTURE[3] ("TEXT" "PLAIN" () NIL  
         NIL "Base64" 2135 181 NIL NIL NIL) BODY[3] {2135} 
           the document in text/plain format 
           ) 
      S: a001 OK FETCH COMPLETED 
 
 
   Example:  The client requests for conversion of a text/html section 
   as text/plain, but only wants 1000 bytes, starting from byte 2001.  
      C: a001 FETCH 2 BODY[3.LCONVERT (ôTEXTö ôPLAINö (ôCHARSETö ôus-
   asciiö))]<2001.1000>  
      S: * 2 FETCH (BODYPARTSTRUCTURE[3] ("TEXT" "PLAIN" () NIL  
         NIL "7bit" 2135 181 NIL NIL NIL) BODY[3]<2001> {135} 
           bytes 2001 - 2135 of the document in text/plain format 
           ) 
      S: a001 OK FETCH COMPLETED 
    
   The server is not required to respect a particular transcoding 
   request or its request parameters, although it MAY try to make a best 
   effort to fulfill that request. Indeed, the server may know a priori 
   information about the client obtained through a different mechanism 
   outside the scope of LCONVERT (e.g. dynamically through device

   description mechanisms or when the device was associated to the 
   account). These preferences may be used to predefine what conversions 
   are possible. Ideally the client should request the same conversions. 
   In addition, this information may also allow attachment adaptation 
   (e.g. picture form factor) instead of solely format conversion. 
    
6.   FETCH response extensions 
    
   The BODYPARTSTRUCTURE data item is introduced when using the LCONVERT 
   extension.  It follows the exact syntax specified in the [RFC3501] 
   BODYSTRUCTURE data item, but contains information for only the 
   converted part.  All information contained in BODYPARTSTRUCTURE 
   pertains to the state of the part after it is converted, such as the 
   converted mime-type, sub-type, size, or charset.  The client must 
   respect the return values and not assume the conversion request 
   succeeds.  
    
7.   Status responses, Response code extensions 
    
   Some transcodings may require parameters. If a transcoding request is 
   sent for a format which requires parameters, the server can reply 
   with a BAD response. Likewise, malformed mime types may also generate 
   BAD responses.  
    
   If the server is unable to perform the requested conversion because a 
   resource is unavailable (internal error, transcoding service down) 
   than a BAD response should be returned. 
    
   If a request is denied because of an operational error, such as lack 
   of disk space, or because the requested conversion for some reason 
   cannot be performed, and there is no fallback for this particular 
   device (such as the case where a proprietary document format has no 
   existing transcoding implementation, and the server recognizes that 
   the client has no default viewer for it), the server SHOULD return a 
   NO response. 
    
   Otherwise, the server should return an OK response. The client in 
   general can tell from the BODYPARTSTRUCTURE response whether or not 
   its request was honored exactly, but may not know exactly why it 
   different. 
    
   The following extension response codes are provided for OK and NO 
   responses to disambiguate those situations, or warn about possible 
   important data loss. 
    
   INFORMATIONLOSS û the conversion was satisfied for conversion 
   request, but it may have resulted in the loss of important data 
   (primarily of use for loss of text data, since richmedia is often 
   compressed with loss)

   device capability knowledge, or server policy. 
    
8.   Formal Syntax 
    
   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur 
   Form (ABNF) notation as used in [ABNF], and incorporates by reference 
   the Core Rules defined in that document. 
    
      This syntax augments the grammar specified in [RFC3501] and 
   [RFC3516]. 
    
   In the ABNF section-msgtext grammar in section 9 of [RFC3501]. 
   Section-msgtext is hereby amended to read: 
    
   section-msgtext = "HEADER" / "HEADER.FIELDS" [".NOT"] SP header-list 
   / "TEXT" / ôXCONVERTö SP xconvert-params 
    
      lconvert-params = "(" (media-basic / default-conversion)  [SP "(" 
      transcoding-params ")"] ")" 
    
      transcoding-params  = transcoding-param-name SP transcoding-param-
   value 
      *(SP transcoding-param-name SP transcoding-param-value) 
    
      transcoding-param-name = string 
    
      transcoding-param-value = string 
    
      default-conversion = "NIL" "NIL" 
    
   In the ABNF syntax ôsection-binaryö of [RFC3516], is amended to: 
    
          section-binary =   "[" [section-part [ô.XCONVERTö SP xconvert-
   params] "]" 
    
Security Considerations 
    
   When an implementation is proxy-based, this may create new security 
   issues.  These issues are discussed in detail in Appendix C, because 
   the issues are dependent on the implementation of this protocol 
   rather than inherent to the protocol itself.

   On bandwidth limited mobile networks where users pay per data 
   volumes, spam may become an important issue. It can be mitigated with 
   appropriate filters and server-side spam prevention tools. These are 
   of course outside the scope of LCONVERT. 
 
   It is also recommended that clients be explicitly registered with the 
   server through separate channels / application. Exchanges should then 
   be paired.

Normative Appendices  
 
A.   Security Issues for Proxy-Based Implementations  
    
   In some implementations, the client may connect to a proxy that sits 
   in an operator network, but the backend email storage server sits in 
   a separate enterprise network.  The enterprise network is assumed to 
   be secure, but the operator network may not be trusted.  If 
   unencrypted information lies in the operator network, that 
   information is vulnerable to attacks. 
    
   If the LCONVERT extensions are all implemented in the enterprise 
   network, then the proxy on the carrier should be an encrypted SSL 
   pass-through proxy.  SSL ensures confidentiality and integrity of the 
   proxied datastream, ensuring that the proxy cannot monitor the 
   content of messages, nor inject commands to modify or corrupt the 
   enterprise email server to corrupt the user's mailbox.  The 
   additional cost for this design is that the backend enterprise email 
   server and the client devices must have additional processing to 
   handle the overhead of SSL. 
    
   If the LCONVERT compliant server is implemented as a backend IMAP 
   server with additional command processing done on the proxy, there 
   are more complex security issues.  This proxy must be able to send 
   commands to the backend server to accomplish its tasks, as well as 
   read information coming from the backend server.  An attacker who 
   compromises the proxy thus can send commands to the backend to change 
   the state of the mail storage, possibly corrupting it.  In addition, 
   it can read responses from the mail server that might contain 
   confidential email information.  This proxy may also send bogus 
   responses back to the client.  Clearly, this setup is not an ideal 
   issue and many complications that make this problem complex to solve.  
   The suggestion recommended is to remedy the problem of unencrypted, 
   untagged FETCH responses that may contain confidential information.  
   Encrypted responses should be used in place of any untagged FETCH 
   responses, which contain encrypted message information to be passed 
   through the proxy on the operator network.  The key exchange for 
   encryption should not occur through the proxy.  It has to be done 
   through another channel: manually entered by user (e.g. password), or 
   via an HTTP SSL request to the enterprise server.  Any other 
   additional server responses containing sensitive information 
   (passwords, etc.) should be encrypted. 
    
   It is beyond the scope of this document to define the implementation 
   of transcoding services. In general, it is recommended that they 
   reside within the same domain as the IMAP server, and are not 
   performed by third party services, which may compromise the privacy 
   of the data being transcoded.

B.   LCONVERT transcoding parameters 
     
   LCONVERT servers MAY support additional transcoding parameters for 
   each media type. All LCONVERT compliant servers MUST minimally 
   support recognition of charset for text/* mime types, although they 
   may decline to honor some requests. For media types other than text, 
   it is beyond the scope of this document to define conversion 
   parameters. In general however, LCONVERT compliant servers MAY choose 
   to support additional parameters, and if so, they SHOULD follow the 
   OMA STI 1.0 spec [OMA-STI] adopting the same parameter names as 
   defined in second 5.2.4 and above for the most popular image/*, 
   video/*, and audio/* codecs 
    
   As an example, in section 5.2.6.2 of [OMA-STI], the parameters 
   "width" and "height" are defined. The following example illustrates 
   how these OMA STI parameters MUST be used with LCONVERT. 
    
         C: a001 UID FETCH 100 BINARY[2.LCONVERT (ôIMAGEö ôJPGö (ôWIDTHö 
   ô128ö ôHEIGHTö ô96ö))]  
         S: * 2 FETCH (UID 100 BODYPARTSTRUCTURE[2] ("IMAGE" "JPG"   
            () NIL NIL "8bit" 4182 NIL NIL NIL) BINARY[2] {4182}   
            <this part of a document is a rescaled image in JPG format 
   with width=128, height=96.>  
            )  
         S: a001 OK UID FETCH COMPLETED
