INTERNET-DRAFT Framework for GMPLS implementation in ECPN   January 2005


Abstract

     In this draft we propose a framework for implementation of (G)MPLS
     technology in Ethernet based Customer Premise Network (ECPN). Major
     goals of this framework are improving QoS capability of Ethernet
     using (G)MPLS technology and facilitating secure access of
     commercial service, such as IP-TV or videophone, in local area
     network. Key solution to achieve the goal is MAC address swapping
     which uses 48bits of Ethernet address in MAC header as labels.
     Ethernet switches supporting this technique identify flows of
     different applications according to MAC addresses. ARP or ICMPv6 is
     used for terminal-to-terminal label negotiation and path
     establishment. Policy can be imposed in controlling user
     connection. Unauthorized user flows are filtered in MAC level.
     Compatibility with legacy Ethernet is provided best because it does
     not require modification in Ethernet format nor relies on VLAN tag.
     This architecture and technology will be aligned with architectural
     framework for Ethernet based Access Network and Core Network.

1. Definition and Requirements for ECPN

     In the requirement draft for GMPLS implementation over Ethernet
     [JAIHYUNG], it was proposed to separate the solutions of GMPLS
     implementation for Ethernet in three level of hierarchy, Ethernet
     based Customer Premise Network  (ECPN), Ethernet based Access
     Network (EAN) and Ethernet based Core Network (ECN). This document
     focuses on solution for ECPN.

     In this document, ECPN is defined as customer network of diverse
     capability and scale, from residential network to enterprise
     network. Terminal users locate in ECPN and produce various requests
     for network service, such as call request for high-quality
     videophone or channel request for HD movie. Providers must supply
     transmission service of satisfactory quality if the contents are
     charged by usage. Assuming that the provider is capable of service
     differentiation in certain granularity, important issues in ECPN
     are how to keep the original quality of traffic flow in customer
     network as consistent in provider network, and how to protect
     valuable contents from internal abuser. Reliability and security of
     individual communication are prime concern in network of open,

     shared community, such as University campus.

     For example in campus network, a user may want a high-quality
     videophone communication using his laptop while others simply want
     besteffort VoIP for free. If the high-quality service is provided
     using a commercial service, there must be a way to secure the user
     flow and to provide preferential service than other flows in local
     network. A stateless approach such as [DiffServe] is inappropriate
     in this situation because it is easy to masquerade identity or
     manipulate service class. An explicit signaling and per-flow policy
     control will offer better protection and service guarantee.

     Other requirements as listed below must be satisfied in ECPN.

     - Evolutional deployment: GMPLS implementation must be operational
     even when the deployment is partial in a local network.
     Communication path of improved quality must be provided though the
     destination terminal is not GMPLS capable and some switches are not
     conforming to new implementation.

     - Low operational overhead: most residential users will not have
     professional knowledge of network. Hence the implementation must
     minimize manual configuration. Auto-discovery of network resources
     and ability for self-configuration are required.

     - Simple class of service: congestion is not a prime concern in
     ECPN because local network is usually over-provisioned. In such
     network, difference between multiple service classes will be
     negligible. Aggregation of upper layer classes into a few
     fundamental classes will be sufficient.

     - Support for coexistence of IPv4 and IPv6: the GMPLS
     implementation must support users of both versions. In particular,
     it must be able to provide data paths of satisfactory quality to
     IPv4 routers and IPv6 routers respectively.

     - Support for multicast of streaming media: Internet broadcasting
     of TV is already in service in some country. Streaming media will
     be one of dominant traffic in residential network. Reliability and
     quality of service are crucial factors in competing with cable TV.
     Fast channel zapping is an issue in IP multicasting. IGMP is too
     slow and vulnerable to DoS attack. Intrinsic solution for Ethernet
     multicast will be necessary.

     - Support for wireless LAN: support for mobility is one of
     important requirements in NGN.


     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
     "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
     this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].

2. Label Switched Ethernet (LSE) Technique

     In the requirements draft of [JAIHYUNG], three candidate methods
     for label encoding in Ethernet were discussed. The three methods
     have their own merits, however, MAC address swapping method as
     proposed in [ETHREAL1] and [SRINIVASAN], shows several good
     properties in providing protection and service guarantee. In this
     section, Label Switched Ethernet (LSE) technology that employs the
     idea of MAC address swapping is presented. Key improvement of LSE
     to the two prior works is use of ARP/ICMPv6 for lightweight LAN
     signaling and LSP setup. Figure 1 below describes MAC address
     swapping compared to typical Ethernet switching.

     Figure 1 Comparison of best-effort forwarding and real-time
     forwarding


     In the upper part of Figure 1, typical procedure for transmitting
     IP packet over Ethernet media is described. In the example, IP
     terminal Ea query Ethernet address of Eb using broadcast of ARP
     (Address Resolution Protocol) message. Upon receiving the broadcast
     message, Eb replies its MAC address in ARP reply message, as a
     result, terminal Ea obtains destination MAC address and transmits
     IP packets encapsulated in Ethernet frames. This is typical
     procedure for IP terminals resolving hardware address of underlying
     layer.

     Note that MAC addresses in Ethernet header are not changed when
     Ethernet switches forward frames. In legacy LAN, Ethernet addresses
     designate physical location of Ethernet device in the network. This
     context is slightly changed in LSE because LSE switches assign new
     addresses on each local link for GMPLS label when an LSP is
     established. Figure 2 below shows proposed format of GMPLS label




Jaihyung Cho                Expires June 2005                   [Page 4]

     used in LSE.



            +------------------+--------------------+
            |  OUI Prefix (24) |      Label (24)    |
            +------------------+--------------------+

     Figure 2:  Proposed Label Format for GMPLS on LAN Media.



     According to MAC address format defined in ISO/IEC 8802, IEEE
     assigns the first 24 bits of OUI part for manufacturers. Ethernet
     manufacturer uses the address block of lower 24 bits to assign a
     global unique number on their products. In the same way, an OUI
     number is necessary for exclusive use of GMPLS protocol in order to
     avoid possible collision with physical addresses of terminals. LSE
     switches use the lower 24bits for labels. This ensures legacy
     terminals and switches coexist with new implementation.

     Using the labeling scheme, LSE switches allocate MAC addresses when
     they receive label request/mapping messages. RSVP can be used for
     this purpose, however, this requires RSVP implementation in all
     terminals and LSE switches. Furthermore, it may require pre-
     knowledge of routes in large-scale network in order to prevent
     surplus flood of RSVP messages.

     In LSE, ARP or Neighbor Discovery (ND) messages in ICMPv6 is used
     for passing information of MAC label between LSE switches. ARP has
     some desirable features to exploit it for GMPLS signaling.

     Firstly, ARP and ND are designed to carry MAC information. Using
     the role, it is suitable to pass MAC label information between
     terminals and switches. This also minimizes impact to terminals
     because it uses existing ARP mechanism for receiving label
     information.  Detail of ARP procedure for LSP setup will be
     explained in separate draft.

     Secondly, the receiving party does not need to understand LSE in
     order to establish LSP between source and destination terminals.
     ARP is common protocol that any IP terminal must support. Although
     a destination terminal is not LSE capable, the terminal will at
     least respond to ARP request as with typical ARP procedure. This
     reaction is sufficient for LSE switches to establish LSP between
     two terminals. This is the strength of LSE over RFC2816 where
     implementation of RSVP in every terminal is pre-requisite.

     Thirdly, there is some correspondence between new application
     session and ARP action. Most network applications try to contact
     with unknown destination first when new session is launching. This
     triggers ARP transmission if subnet setting in user terminal is

     proper. Hence ARP can be a sign to announce new application session
     in Ethernet layer. It is noted that connection-oriented feature can
     be brought in IP network if we utilize this property.

     The procedure for LSP setup and swapping of MAC address is
     described in the lower part of Figure 1. Detail of ARP procedure
     for negotiating labels is not shown in the diagram.

     In the ARP procedure, source terminal Ea transmits ARP to resolve
     Ethernet address of destination terminal Eb. LSE switches, S1 and
     S2, intercept this ARP request message and manipulate MAC
     information contained in the message. The information includes
     parameters necessary for establishing LSP, and it is only meaningul
     to LSE switches. Most terminals ignore the information.

     When the destination Eb responds with ARP reply, S1 and S2 allocate
     labels (i.e., new MAC addresses) and configure swapping entries of
     MAC addresses in MAC table. The label information is passed using
     ARP reply. In the example, S1 assigned 'La' for this flow and put
     this value in ARP reply message. Source terminal Ea believes that
     'La' is the Ethernet address of Eb and transmits data frames using
     the label.

     When S1 receives this frame, S1 performs normal MAC table lookup
     using the destination address 'La' and identifies that 'La' is the
     label that S1 assigned for this flow and the frame requires real-
     time service. Note that information necessary for service
     classification, flow control and forwarding decision can all be
     obtain from simple MAC table lookup. This greatly simplifies
     hardware structure in implementing functions for per-flow service
     differentiation. Otherwise, a switch might need to check additional
     fields, such as VLAN tag, MPLS labels, IP header and TCP header, in
     order to classify type of service and application in fine grain.

     S1 swaps MAC addresses in the header from (DA=La, SA=Ea) to (DA=Lc,
     SA=Lb) when it forwards the frame. 'Lb' is the address S1 assigned
     on output interface and 'Lc' is the address S2 assigned on input
     interface for this flow.

     LSPs in ECPN are bi-directional that frames transmitted from S1 to
     S2 will have MAC addresses of (DA=Lc, SA=Lb), however in reverse
     direction, the addresses in the MAC header will be (DA=Lb, SA=Lc)
     (see Figure 1). There can be many legacy Ethernet switches locating
     between LSE switches or terminals, and the Ethernet switches will
     correctly learn the MAC addresses at both directions.

     Conceptually, LSE switches take the role of proxy terminals that
     other users listening the traffic would believe that 'Lb' is the
     address of Ea and 'Lc' is the address of Eb. This gives an effect
     of concealing actual addresses of terminals and provides some
     protection from malicious attack. This feature is useful in access
     network as well as military network where security for private

INTERNET-DRAFT Framework for GMPLS implementation in ECPN   January 2005


     communication is important.

     Finally, S2 swaps MAC addresses from (DA=Lc, SA=Lb) to (DA=Eb,
     SA=Ld) when it forwards the frame to Eb. 'Ld' is the label that S2
     assigned on output interface for this flow. Although a terminal may
     establish multiple LSPs, the terminal does not need to install
     multiple MAC addresses on interface card because LSE switch will
     faithfully change different labels in destination address field to
     actual hardware address before passing frames to final destination.
     The procedure for frame transmission of reverse direction is
     similar to above. This will not be explained in detail in this
     document.

     The LSE technique explained above is somewhat complex than typical
     Ethernet switching. However, added complexity is minimal because it
     only requires marginal increase in MAC entries and latency for
     header swapping. The tradeoff is improved protection and service
     guarantee of fine granularity comparable to MPLS routers. In
     essence, the swapping operation of MAC addresses has same effect as
     swapping of shim headers in MPLS router. However, LSE works in the
     context of Ethernet layer, not in IP realm. The implication is
     that, LSE does not require heavy protocol stacks, such as IP
     routing and MPLS signaling, nor heavy hardware implementation other
     than typical MAC table lookup, yet it brings advantage and
     capability of MPLS routers into Ethernet switches.

     LSE is new technique evolving Ethernet toward next generation.
     There are lots of potential areas of further sophistication. For
     example in backbone or access network, Ethernet switches may
     provide backup paths and protection service of carrier class using
     the technique. This will greatly enhance reliability of Ethernet
     switches that high-performance Ethernet switches may replace some
     core routers in future. It also offers versatile tool to operators
     that Ethernet operators may control traffic flows precisely. LSE
     makes Ethernet switch no longer a dumb machine but smart peer to
     interoperate with IP routers.



3. Examples of Service Scenario

     A major goal of LSE in ECPN is providing reliable platform for
     commercial service in private network. ARP/ICMPv6 is proposed for
     explicit method of accessing commercial service of provider
     network. Using the protocols, user applications establish lower
     layer connection with corresponding server or gateway, and proceed
     with high-level admission procedure, such as user authentication
     and billing, etc. Detail of service architecture and access
     procedure is out of scope. This section only deals with
     interconnection issue with provider network. While there can be
     many different types of access network, this document only focuses
     on the case that ECPN is connected via Ethernet based Access

     Network (EAN).

     Figure 3 below shows an example that residential users request
     guaranteed service for commercial applications via premium service
     network. It is assumed that the premium service network is IPv6 and
     the network is dedicated for delivering value-added traffic, such
     as IP-TV streams or videophone flows. Server groups for user
     authentication, billing, application service, locate in this
     network. User terminals, H1~H4, are directly attached to Ethernet
     switch or DSLAM of LSE function, and receive most besteffort
     Internet service from IPv4 network. This example is selected in
     order to demonstrate capability for supporting both versions of IP
     networks.

       xDSL
     Subscribers

     Figure 3  A service scenario for residential users


     When user terminals, H1~H4, are initiated and obtain IPv4 address
     of default gateway, terminals issue ARP request to resolve Ethernet
     address of the default gateway. The LSE switch in Figure 3 assigns
     new MAC addresses and configures swapping entries for each
     besteffort flow of the terminals as the switch relays ARP messages.
     The LSE switch informs different MAC addresses to each terminal
     using ARP reply, hence establishes point-to-point LSPs for
     besteffort service. Access speed of Internet connection of each
     subscriber can be controlled according to MAC information. Ability
     for point-to-point service and bandwidth limiting for each
     subscriber are similar to PPP, however, much powerful and flexible.
     The besteffort LSPs will receive low priority service than LSPs
     established for premium service. Note that besteffort users are not
     aware of LSE service at all.

     When a user requests premium service, such as videophone
     communication, IPv6 application in user terminal will try to
     contact with corresponding application server or gateway locating
     in IPv6 network. This triggers transmission of Neighbor
     Solicitation (NS), and the LSE switch relays NS to the IPv6
     network. Since ICMPv6 has rich set of optional fields, additional




Jaihyung Cho                Expires June 2005                   [Page 8]


INTERNET-DRAFT Framework for GMPLS implementation in ECPN   January 2005


     information, such as authentication and encryption keys, traffic
     descriptors, can be piggybacked in NS. This reinforces security and
     reliability of LSE.

     When the application server admits the request, and responds with
     Neighbor Advertisement (NA), LSE switch assigns MAC addresses and
     configures swapping entries for both directions, hence establishes
     a bi-directional LSP for premium service. The MAC address is passed
     to terminal using NA. Ethernet frames that use this MAC address
     will receive high-priority service than other besteffort frames.

     Since LSE switch allocated different MAC addresses for each
     besteffort terminal as well as for each premium flow, service
     classes of the flows are identified from simple MAC table lookup.

     The strength of LSE over VLAN in access network is improved
     security and flexibility in policy control. In typical Ethernet,
     switches frequently broadcast frames and it can be security hazard
     because user data and physical addresses are exposed to other
     users. Malicious user may infiltrate into machines of other home
     user if MAC address is known. Some ISP configures port-based VLAN
     for each subscriber line in order to prevent user broadcast,
     however, this also blocks legitimate connection between users.
     Furthermore, this limits application of VLAN for other purpose,
     such as user tagging of VLAN.

     In contrast, LSE offers good protection because LSE switch may
     block broadcast of user frames and allows frame forwarding only
     when MAC entry is set using ARP. Physical addresses of user
     terminals are never exposed. It will be difficult for intruder to
     track down MAC address reaching a target machine if it is
     dynamically changed. Direct communication between users is allowed
     only when operator sets permission for exchanging ARP on LSE
     switch. Various types of policy can be imposed to control ARP
     negotiation between terminals. For this property, LSE provides
     better service and protection than legacy Ethernet in application
     to public network and military network.

     Figure 4 below shows other example of LSE application to enterprise
     network. In figure 4, it is assumed that a company wants to
     introduce integrated service of data and videophone communication
     using its Ethernet infrastructure. LSE switches are deployed
     gradually as the company upgrades old switches, 'L2' in the figure.
     Internet connection and data communication between users must be
     uninterrupted, while quality of video communication is improved as
     the ratio of LSE deployment is increased. The videophone can either
     be stand-alone type plugged in LSE switch or integrated in PC. IPv6
     is assumed for videophone application, thus IPv4 and IPv6 terminals
     coexist in this case.

     Figure 4  A service scenario for enterprise network


     In the example above, IPv4 terminals, H1 and H2, obtain Ethernet
     address of gateway using ARP. When there are no LSE switches in the
     path of ARP negotiation, the terminal uses physical address of
     default gateway. However, when an LSE switch locates between a
     terminal and the gateway, the LSE switch intercepts ARP, allocates
     MAC addresses and configures swapping entries for besteffort
     frames. As a result, traffic flows passing LSE switches are
     properly managed, however the part of network that LSE is not
     deployed may experience unexpected traffic disturbance.

     Videophone applications use NS to resolve hardware address of
     target videophone. LSE switches establish point-to-point LSP of
     premium service, prior to connection procedure of application
     protocols. When the communicating party is an external user
     (public), NS must be relayed outside the enterprise network toward
     premium service network. The gateway of the company can be replaced
     to an amphibian switch that has both capability of IPv4 routing and
     LSE switching. However in the example, it is assumed that a
     dedicated LSE switch for premium service is deployed at the border
     of the enterprise network.

     NS and NA for external communication are exchanged via the border
     LSE switch, as a result, LSP of required resource is established.
     Strict policy can be imposed in the border LSE switch to prevent
     illegal access from public. Data frames of public network are
     relayed only when corresponding MAC entry exists during the
     application session. Contrast to typical Ethernet switch, internal
     data frames and physical addresses of terminals are not exposed to
     public because border LSE switch blocks unnecessary broadcast
     frames.

4. Conclusion


     In this draft, an LSE technique improving service and protection of
     Ethernet based Customer Premise Network is presented. ARP or ND is
     proposed for explicit signal of establishing LSP between terminals.
     Effectiveness of MAC address swapping in providing real-time
     service is proven in experimental results of S.Varadarajan
     [ETHREAL1] [ETHREAL2] [ETHREAL3]. Integrated service for data and
     real-time communication can be supported using cost-effective
     Ethernet hardware. ISPs are able to provide commercial services
     that are charged by usage per application using the architecture.
     Features of policy enforcement and MAC hiding improve security, and
     extend area of potential application to public network and military
     network. Similar technique and architecture will be employed in
     proposals for Ethernet based Access Network (EAN) and Ethernet
     based Core Network (ECN) in future.
