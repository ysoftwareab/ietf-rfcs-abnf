Abstract

   This document defines the PCEP extension for PCE application in
   Native IP network. The scenario and architecture of PCE in native IP
   is described in [I-D.draft-wang-teas-pce-native-ip-01.txt]. This
   draft describes the key information that is transferred between PCE
   and PCC to accomplish the end2end traffic assurance in Native IP
   network under central control mode.

1. Introduction

   Traditionally, MPLS-TE traffic assurance requires the corresponding
   network devices support MPLS or the complex RSVP/LDP/Segment Routing
   etc. technologies to assure the end-to-end traffic performance. But
   in native IP network, there will be no such signaling protocol to
   synchronize the action among different network devices. It is

   necessary to use the central control mode that described in [I-
   D.draft-zhao-teas-pce-control-function] to correlate the forwarding
   behavior among different network devices. Draft [I-D.draft-wang-
   teas-pce-native-ip-00.txt] describes the architecture and solution
   philosophy for the end2end traffic assurance in Native IP network
   via Dual/Multi BGP solution. This draft describes the corresponding
   PCEP extension to transfer the key information about BGP peer
   relationship, BGP Prefix advertised and the static route on on-path
   router.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3. New Objects Extension

   Three new objects are defined in this draft, they are BGP PEER
   object, BGP PREFIX object and STATICROUTE object.

   BGP PEER object is used to tell the network device which peer it
   should be peered with dynamically, BGP PREFIX object is used to tell
   which prefixes should be advertised via the corresponding BGP peer
   and STATICROUTE object is used to point out which route should be to
   taken to arrive to the bgp peer.

4. Object Formats.

   Each extension object takes the similar format, that is to say, it
   began with the common object header defined in [RFC5440] as the
   following:

       0                   1                   2                   3

   Different object-class, object type and the corresponding object
   body is defined separated in the following section.

4.1. BGP PEER Object.

   The BGP PEER object is used in a PCE Initiate message [draft-ietf-
   pce-pce-initiated-lsp] to specify the ip address of BGP peer that
   the received network device should establish the BGP relationship
   with.

   This Object should only be sent to the head and end router of the
   end2end path in case there is no RR involved. If the RR is used
   between the head end routers, then such information should be sent
   to head router/RR and end router/RR respectively.

   BGP PEER Object Object-Class is **

   BGP PEER Object Object-Type is **

    0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Peer-Id(8 bits): To distinguish the different BGP Peer, will be
      referenced in BGP PREFIX object, if the PCE use multiBGP solution
      for different QoS assurance requirement.

   AT(8 bits): Address Type. To indicate the address type of BGP Peer.
      Equal to 4, if the following IP address of BGP peer is belong to
      IPv4; Equal to 6 if the following IP address of BGP peer is belong
      to IPv6.

   Resv(16 bits): Reserved for future use.

      when AT equal to 4, length is 32bit; IPv6 address of the BGP peer
      when AT equal to 16, length is 128bit;



4.2. BGP PREFIX Object

   THE BGP PREFIX object is carried within in a PCE Initiate message
   [draft-ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] to specify the IP prefixes that
   should be advertised by the corresponding BGP Peer.

   This Object should only be sent to the head and end router of the
   end2end path in case there is no RR involved. If the RR is used
   between the head end routers, then such information should be sent
   to head router/RR and end router/RR respectively.

   Peer-Id(8 bits): To indicate which BGP peer should be used to
      advertise the following IP Prefix TLV. This value is assigned in
      the BGP PEER object and is referred in this object.

   AT(8 bits): Address Type. To indicate the address type of BGP Peer.
      Equal to 4, if the following IP address of BGP peer is belong to
      IPv4; Equal to 6 if the following IP address of BGP peer is belong

   THE STATICROUTE Object is carried in a PCE Initiate message [draft-
   ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] to specify the static route to the
   corresponding BGP peer address on each device that is on the end2end
   assurance path.

   This Object should be sent to all the devices that locates on the
