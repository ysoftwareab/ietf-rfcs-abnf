<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
This document defines the forwarding element (FE) model used in the 
Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) protocol.  The 
model represents the capabilities, state and configuration of 
forwarding elements within the context of the ForCES protocol, so 
that control elements (CEs) can control the FEs accordingly.  More 
specifically, the model describes the logical functions that are 
present in an FE, what capabilities these functions support, and how 
these functions are or can be interconnected.  This FE model is 
intended to satisfy the model requirements specified in the ForCES 
requirements draft,<a class='info' href='#RFC3654'>RFC3654<span> (</span><span class='info'>Khosravi, H. and T. Anderson, &ldquo;Requirements for Separation of IP Control and Forwarding,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> [2].

<p>

<p>
The use of compliance terminology (MUST, SHOULD, MAY) is used in accordance
with <a class='info' href='#RFC2119'>RFC2119<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bradner, S., &ldquo;Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels,&rdquo; March&nbsp;1997.</span><span>)</span></a> [1].  Such terminology is used in
describing the required behavior of ForCES forwarding elements or control
elements in supporting or manipulating information described in this model.

</p>

<p>
Terminology associated with the ForCES requirements is defined in 
<a class='info' href='#RFC3654'>RFC3654<span> (</span><span class='info'>Khosravi, H. and T. Anderson, &ldquo;Requirements for Separation of IP Control and Forwarding,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> [2] and is not copied here.  
The following list of terminology relevant to the FE model is defined 
in this section. 

</p>

<p>
FE Model -- The FE model is designed to model the logical processing 
functions of an FE.  The FE model proposed in this document includes 
three components: the modeling of individual logical functional 
blocks (LFB model), the logical interconnection between LFBs (LFB 
topology) and the FE level attributes, including FE capabilities.  
The FE model provides the basis to define the information elements 
exchanged between the CE and the FE in the ForCES protocol.  

</p>

<p>
Datapath -- A conceptual path taken by packets within the forwarding 
plane inside an FE.  Note that more than one datapath can exist 
within an FE. 

</p>

<p>
LFB (Logical Functional Block) Class (or type) -- A template that 
representing a fine-grained, logically separable aspect of FE 
processing.  Most LFBs relate to packet processing in the data path. 
LFB classes are the basic building blocks of the FE model. 

</p>

LFB Instance -- As a packet flows through an FE along a datapath, it 
flows through one or multiple LFB instances, where each LFB is an 
instance of a specific LFB class.  Multiple instances of the same 
LFB class can be present in an FE's datapath.  Note that we often 
refer to LFBs without distinguishing between an LFB class and LFB 
instance when we believe the implied reference is obvious for the 
given context. 

</p>

<p>
LFB Model -- The LFB model describes the content and structures in 
an LFB, plus the associated data definition.  Four types of 
information are defined in the LFB model.  The core part of the LFB 
model is the LFB class definitions; the other three types define the 
associated data including common data types, supported frame formats 
and metadata. 

</p>

<p>
LFB Metadata -- Metadata is used to communicate per-packet state 
from one LFB to another, but is not sent across the network.  The FE 
model defines how such metadata is identified, produced and consumed 
by the LFBs, but not how the per-packet state is implemented within 
actual hardware.  Metadata is sent between the FE and the CE on 
redirect packets. 

</p>

<p>
LFB Component -- Operational parameters of the LFBs that must be 
visible to the CEs are conceptualized in the FE model as the LFB 
components.  The LFB components include: flags, single parameter 
arguments, complex arguments, and tables that the CE can read or/and 
write via the ForCES protocol. 

</p>

<p>
Structure Component -- Forces allows for complex data structures to
be used in its data definitions.  Generally, these include tables and 
Structures.  The individual parts which make up a structured set of data
are referred to as Structure Components.  These can themselves be of any
valid data type, including tables and structures.

</p>

<p>
Component -- Often in describing the forces model and its operational,
it is useful to refer to the parts of an LFB or structure, without
regard to what they are part of.  The term component by itself will be 
used to refer to these parts.  If the context is unclear, but it is
necessary to refer explicitly to either LFB Components or Structure 
Components, then the modifying word will be present.  When the 
correct prefix is clear from context, or when no differentiation is 
needed, no modifier will be used.

</p>

<p>
Element -- Element is generally used in this document in accordance with
the XML usage of the term.  It refers to an XML tagged part of an XML document.
For a precise definition, please see the full set of XML specifications
from the W3C.  This term is included in this list for completeness, and
because earlier versions of this document used the term element
inconsistently.  The other use of the term element is in terms of the FE
and CE (Forwarding Element and Control Element.)  As those are not textual
or data structure items, context provides sufficient clarity for this usage.

</p>

<p>Attribute -- Attribute is used in the XML sense of attribute information
include in an XML tag.

</p>

<p>
LFB Topology -- A representation of the logical interconnection and 
the placement of LFB instances along the datapath within one FE.  
Sometimes this representation is called intra-FE topology, to be 
distinguished from inter-FE topology.  LFB topology is outside of 
the LFB model, but is part of the FE model. 

</p>

<p>
FE Topology -- A representation of how multiple FEs within a single 
NE are interconnected.  Sometimes this is called inter-FE topology, 
to be distinguished from intra-FE topology (i.e., LFB topology).  An 
individual FE might not have the global knowledge of the full FE 
topology, but the local view of its connectivity with other FEs is 
considered to be part of the FE model.  The FE topology is 
discovered by the ForCES base protocol or by some other means. 

</p>

<p>
Inter-FE Topology -- See FE Topology. 

</p>

<p>
Intra-FE Topology -- See LFB Topology.  

</p>

<p>
LFB class library -- A set of LFB classes that has been identified 
as the most common functions found in most FEs and hence should be 
      defined first by the ForCES Working Group.

Introduction</h3>

<p>

<p>
<a class='info' href='#RFC3746'>RFC3746<span> (</span><span class='info'>Yang, L., Dantu, R., Anderson, T., and R. Gopal, &ldquo;Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) Framework,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> [3] specifies a framework by which 
control elements (CEs) can configure and manage one or more separate 
forwarding elements (FEs) within a networking element (NE) using the 
ForCES protocol.  
The ForCES architecture allows Forwarding Elements of varying 
functionality to participate in a ForCES network element.  The 
implication of this varying functionality is that CEs can make only 
minimal assumptions about the functionality provided by FEs in an 
NE.  Before CEs can configure and control the forwarding behavior of 
FEs, CEs need to query and discover the capabilities and states of 
their FEs.<a class='info' href='#RFC3654'>RFC3654<span> (</span><span class='info'>Khosravi, H. and T. Anderson, &ldquo;Requirements for Separation of IP Control and Forwarding,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> [2] mandates that the 
capabilities, states and configuration information be expressed in the 
form of an FE model. 

</p>

<p>
<a class='info' href='#RFC3444'>RFC3444<span> (</span><span class='info'>Pras, A. and J. Schoenwaelder, &ldquo;On the Difference between Information Models and Data Models,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> [8] observed that information models 
(IMs) and data models (DMs) are different because they serve different 
purposes.  
"The main purpose of an IM is to model managed objects at a conceptual 
level, independent of any specific implementations or protocols 
used".  "DMs, conversely, are defined at a lower level of 
abstraction and include many details.  They are intended for 
implementors and include protocol-specific constructs."  Sometimes 
it is difficult to draw a clear line between the two.  The FE model 
described in this document is primarily an information model, but 
also includes some aspects of a data model, such as explicit 
definitions of the LFB class schema and FE schema.  It is expected 
that this FE model will be used as the basis to define the payload 
for information exchange between the CE and FE in the ForCES 
protocol.

be satisfied by a ForCES FE model.  To summarize, an FE model must define: 

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
Logically separable and distinct packet forwarding operations 
in an FE datapath (logical functional blocks or LFBs); 

</li>
<li>
The possible topological relationships (and hence the sequence 
of packet forwarding operations) between the various LFBs; 

</li>
<li>
The possible operational capabilities (e.g., capacity limits, 
constraints, optional features, granularity of configuration) 
of each type of LFB; 

</li>
<li>
The possible configurable parameters (i.e., attributes) of each 
type of LFB; 

</li>
<li>
Metadata that may be exchanged between LFBs.

<a name="rfc.section.2.2"></a><h3>2.2.&nbsp;
The FE Model in Relation to FE Implementations </h3>

<p>
The FE model proposed here is based on an abstraction of distinct 
logical functional blocks (LFBs), which are interconnected in a 
directed graph, and receive, process, modify, and transmit packets 
along with metadata.  The FE model should be designed such that 
different implementations of the forwarding datapath can be 
logically mapped onto the model with the functionality and sequence 
of operations correctly captured.  However, the model is not 
intended to directly address how a particular implementation maps to 
an LFB topology.  It is left to the forwarding plane vendors to 
define how the FE functionality is represented using the FE model.   
Our goal is to design the FE model such that it is flexible enough 
to accommodate most common implementations.  

</p>
<p>
The LFB topology model for a particular datapath implementation must 
correctly capture the sequence of operations on the packet.  
Metadata generation by certain LFBs MUST always precede any use of 
that metadata by subsequent LFBs in the topology graph; this is 
required for logically consistent operation.  Further, modification 
of packet fields that are subsequently used as inputs for further 
processing MUST occur in the order specified in the model for that 
particular implementation to ensure correctness.

<a name="rfc.section.2.3"></a><h3>2.3.&nbsp;
The FE Model in Relation to the ForCES Protocol </h3>

<p>
The ForCES base protocol is used by the CEs and FEs to maintain the 
communication channel between the CEs and FEs.  The ForCES protocol 
may be used to query and discover the inter-FE topology.  The 
details of a particular datapath implementation inside an FE, 
including the LFB topology, along with the operational capabilities 
and attributes of each individual LFB, are conveyed to the CE within 
information elements in the ForCES protocol.  The model of an LFB 
class should define all of the information that needs to be 
exchanged between an FE and a CE for the proper configuration and 
management of that LFB.   

</p>
<p>
Specifying the various payloads of the ForCES messages in a 
systematic fashion is difficult without a formal definition of the 
objects being configured and managed (the FE and the LFBs within).  
The FE Model document defines a set of classes and components for 
describing and manipulating the state of the LFBs within an FE.  
These class definitions themselves will generally not appear in the 
ForCES protocol.  Rather, ForCES protocol operations will reference 
classes defined in this model, including relevant components and the 
defined operations.

</p>
<p>
<a class='info' href='#Section7'>Section&nbsp;7<span> (</span><span class='info'>Using the FE model in the ForCES Protocol</span><span>)</span></a> provides more detailed discussion on how 
the FE model should be used by the ForCES protocol.

<a name="rfc.section.2.4"></a><h3>2.4.&nbsp;
Modeling Language for the FE Model </h3>

<p>
Even though not absolutely required, it is beneficial to use a 
formal data modeling language to represent the conceptual FE model 
described in this document.  Use of a formal language can help to 
enforce consistency and logical compatibility among LFBs.  A full 
specification will be written using such a data modeling language. 
The formal definition of the LFB classes may facilitate the eventual 
automation of some of the code generation process and the functional 
validation of arbitrary LFB topologies.  These class definitions 
form the LFB Library.  Documents which describe LFB Classes are 
therefore referred to as LFB Library documents. 

</p>
<p>
Human readability was the most important factor considered when 
selecting the specification language, whereas encoding, decoding and 
transmission performance was not a selection factor. The encoding 
method for over the wire transport is not dependent on the 
specification language chosen and is outside the scope of this 
document and up to the ForCES protocol to define.   

</p>
<p>
XML was chosen as the specification language in this document, 
because XML has the advantage of being both human and machine 
readable with widely available tools support. This document uses XML 
Schema to define the structure of the LFB Library documents, as 
defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC3470'>[9]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hollenbeck, S., Rose, M., and L.

While 
these LFB Class definitions are not sent in the Forces protocol, these 
definitions comply with the recommendations in <a class='info' href='#RFC3470'>RFC3470<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hollenbeck, S., Rose, M., and L.

discusses the logical inter-connection and ordering between LFB instances 
within an FE, that is, the LFB topology.  

</p>
<p>
The FE model proposed in this document has two major aspects:
the LFB model and FE Object defintion whose components include FE capability
information and LFB topology information. 
 The LFB model provides the content 
and data structures to define each individual LFB class.  The FE Object class
defines the components to 
provide information at the FE level, particularly the 
capabilities of the FE at a coarse level.  Part of the FE level 
information is the LFB topology, which expresses the logical inter-
connection between the LFB instances along the datapath(s) within 
the FE.  Details of these aspects are described in 
<a class='info' href='#Section4'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'> Model and Schema for LFB Classes</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#Section5'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>FE Components and Capabilities</span><span>)</span></a>.  
The intent of this section is to discuss these concepts at the 
high level and lay the foundation for the detailed description in 
the following sections.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1"></a><h3>3.1.&nbsp;
FE Capability Model and State Model </h3>

<p>

The ForCES FE model includes both a capability and a state model.  
The FE capability model describes the capabilities and capacities of 
an FE by specifying the variation in functions supported and any 
limitations.  The FE state model describes the current state of the 
FE, that is, the instantaneous values or operational behavior of the 
FE.  Equally, this concept applies to LFB classes, where the capability 
information indicates what this FE is capable of providing using the
specific LFB Class, or even the specific component (such as the table
size limits.)  Capability information is always read-only, as it
describes what the FE / LFB can provide, not what the CE has requested. 

</p>
<p>
Conceptually, the FE capability model tells the CE which states are 
allowed on an FE, with capacity information indicating certain 
quantitative limits or constraints.  Thus, the CE has general 
knowledge about configurations that are applicable to a particular 
FE.  For example, an FE capability model may describe the FE at a 
coarse level such as: 

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
this FE can handle IPv4 and IPv6 forwarding; 

</li>
<li>
this FE can perform classification on the following fields: 
source IP address, destination IP address, source port number, 
destination port number, etc; 

</li>
<li>
this FE can perform metering; 

</li>
<li>
this FE can handle up to N queues (capacity); 

</li>
<li>
this FE can add and remove encapsulating headers of types 
including IPSec, GRE, L2TP. 

</li>
</ul>
<p>
While one could try and build an object model to fully represent the 
FE capabilities, other efforts found this to be a significant 
undertaking.  The main difficulty arises in describing detailed 
limits, such as the maximum number of classifiers, queues, buffer 
pools, and meters the FE can provide.  We believe that a good 
balance between simplicity and flexibility can be achieved for the 
FE model by combining coarse level capability reporting with an 
error reporting mechanism.  That is, if the CE attempts to instruct 
the FE to set up some specific behavior it cannot support, the FE 
will return an error indicating the problem.  Examples of similar 
approaches include DiffServ PIB <a class='info' href='#RFC3317'>RFC3317<span> (</span><span class='info'>Chan, K., Sahita, R., Hahn, S., and K. McCloghrie, &ldquo;Differentiated Services Quality of Service Policy Information Base,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> [4]
and Framework PIB <a class='info' href='#RFC3318'>RFC3318<span> (</span><span class='info'>Sahita, R., Hahn, S., Chan, K., and K. McCloghrie, &ldquo;Framework Policy Information Base,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> [5]. 

</p>
<p>
There is one common and shared aspect of capability that will be 
handled in a separate fashion.  For all components (i.e. LFB components
and Structure components), 
certain property information is needed.  All components need to provide 
information as to whether they are supported and if so whether the 
components is readable or writeable.  Based on their type, many 
components have additional common properties (for example, arrays have 
their current size.)  There is a specific model and protocol 
mechanism for referencing this form of property information about 
components of the model. 

</p>
<p>
The FE state model presents the snapshot view of the FE to the CE.  
For example, using an FE state model, an FE may be described to its 
corresponding CE as the following:  

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
on a given port, the packets are classified using a given 
classification filter; 

</li>
<li>
the given classifier results in packets being metered in a 
certain way, and then marked in a certain way; 

</li>
<li>
the packets coming from specific markers are delivered into a 
shared queue for handling, while other packets are delivered to 
a different queue; 

</li>
<li>
a specific scheduler with specific behavior and parameters will 
service these collected queues. 

</li>
</ul>

<p>
The concepts relating to LFBs, particularly capability at the LFB 
level and LFB topology will be discussed in the rest of this 
section. 

</p>
<p>
Capability information at the LFB level is an integral part of the 
LFB model, and is modeled the same way as the other operational 
parameters inside an LFB.  For example, when certain features of an 
LFB class are optional, the CE MUST be able to determine whether 
those optional features are supported by a given LFB instance.  Such 
capability information is modeled as either property information, or 
for LFB information not provided by the defined properties, as capability
components which are inherently read-only.  The schema for the definition
of LFB classes provides for identifying such components.

</p>
<p>
Capability information at the FE level may describe the LFB classes 
that the FE can instantiate; the number of instances of each that 
can be created; the topological (linkage) limitations between these 
LFB instances, etc.  <a class='info' href='#Section5'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>FE Components and Capabilities</span><span>)</span></a> defines the FE level 
components including capability information.  Since all information is
represented as LFBs, this is provided by a single instance of the FE Object
LFB Class.   By using a single instance with a known LFB Class and a known
instance identification,  the Forces Protocol can allow a CE to access this
information whenever it needs to, including as part of establishing the
control of the FE by the CE.

</p>
<p>
Once the FE capability is described to the CE, the FE state 
information can be represented by two levels.  The first level is 
the logically separable and distinct packet processing functions, 
called Logical Functional Blocks (LFBs).  The second level of 
information describes how these individual LFBs are ordered and 
placed along the datapath to deliver a complete forwarding plane 
service.  The interconnection and ordering of the LFBs is called LFB 
Topology. <a class='info' href='#Section32'>Section&nbsp;3.2<span> (</span><span class='info'> LFB (Logical Functional Block) Modeling </span><span>)</span></a> discusses high level concepts 
around LFBs, whereas <a class='info' href='#Section33'>Section&nbsp;3.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>FE Datapath Modeling </span><span>)</span></a> discusses LFB topology 
issues.  This topology information is represented as components of the
FE Object LFB instance, to allow the CE to fetch and manipulate this.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2"></a><h3>3.2.&nbsp;
 LFB (Logical Functional Block) Modeling </h3>

<p>
Each LFB performs a well-defined action or computation on the 
packets passing through it.  Upon completion of its prescribed 
function, either the packets are modified in certain ways (e.g., 
decapsulator, marker), or some results are generated and stored, 
often in the form of metadata (e.g., classifier).  Each LFB 
typically performs a single action.  Classifiers, shapers and meters 
are all examples of such LFBs.  Modeling LFBs at such a fine 
granularity allows us to use a small number of LFBs to express the 
higher-order FE functions (such as an IPv4 forwarder) precisely, 
which in turn can describe more complex networking functions and 
vendor implementations of software and hardware.  These LFBs will be 
defined in detail in one or more documents. 

</p>
<p>
An LFB has one or more inputs, each of which takes a packet P, and 
optionally metadata M; and produces one or more outputs, each of 
which carries a packet P', and optionally metadata M'.  Metadata is 
data associated with the packet in the network processing device 
(router, switch, etc.) and is passed from one LFB to the next, but 
is not sent across the network.  In general, multiple LFBs are 
contained in one FE, as shown in <a class='info' href='#Figure2'>Figure&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Generic LFB Diagram</span><span>)</span></a>, and all 
the LFBs share the same ForCES protocol termination point that implements 
the ForCES protocol logic and maintains the communication channel to and 
from the CE.

<p>
An LFB, as shown in <a class='info' href='#Figure2'>Figure&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Generic LFB Diagram</span><span>)</span></a>, has inputs, outputs and 
components that can be queried and manipulated by the CE via an 
Fp reference point (defined in RFC 3746 [2]) and the ForCES protocol 
termination point.  The horizontal axis is in the forwarding plane 
for connecting the inputs and outputs of LFBs within the same FE. 
The vertical axis between the CE and the FE denotes the Fp reference 
point where bidirectional communication between the CE and FE 
occurs: the CE to FE communication is for configuration, control and 
packet injection while FE to CE communication is used for packet re-
direction to the control plane, monitoring and accounting 
information, errors, etc.  Note that the interaction between the CE 
and the LFB is only abstract and indirect.  The result of such an 
interaction is for the CE to manipulate the components of 
the LFB instances.   

</p>
<p>

A namespace is used to associate a unique name or ID with each LFB 
class.  The namespace MUST be extensible so that a new LFB class can 
be added later to accommodate future innovation in the forwarding 
plane.     

</p>
<p>
LFB operation is specified in the model to allow the CE to 
understand the behavior of the forwarding datapath.  For instance, 
the CE must understand at what point in the datapath the IPv4 header 
TTL is decremented.  That is, the CE needs to know if a control 
packet could be delivered to it either before or after this point in 
the datapath.  In addition, the CE MUST understand where and what 
type of header modifications (e.g., tunnel header append or strip) 
are performed by the FEs.  Further, the CE MUST verify that the 
various LFBs along a datapath within an FE are compatible to link 
together. 

</p>
<p>
There is value to vendors if the operation of LFB classes can be 
expressed in sufficient detail so that physical devices implementing 
different LFB functions can be integrated easily into an FE design.  
Therefore, a semi-formal specification is needed; that is, a text 
description of the LFB operation (human readable), but sufficiently 
specific and unambiguous to allow conformance testing and efficient 
design, so that interoperability between different CEs and FEs can 
be achieved.  

</p>
<p>
The LFB class model specifies information such as: 

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
number of inputs and outputs (and whether they are 
configurable) 

</li>
<li>
metadata read/consumed from inputs; 

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
packet type(s) accepted at the inputs and emitted at the

LFB Outputs</h3>

<p>
An LFB output is a conceptual port on an LFB that can send 
information to another LFB.  The information is typically a packet 
and its associated metadata, although in some cases it might consist 
of only metadata, i.e., with no packet data.

<p>
A single LFB output can be connected to only one LFB input.  This is 
required to make the packet flow through the LFB topology

</pre></div><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" align="center"><tr><td align="center"><font face="monaco, MS Sans Serif" size="1"><b>&nbsp;Figure&nbsp;3: Examples of LFBs with various output combinations.&nbsp;</b></font><br /></td></tr></table><hr class="insert" />

<p>
To accommodate a non-trivial LFB topology, multiple LFB outputs are 
needed so that an LFB class can fork the datapath.  Two mechanisms 
are provided for forking: multiple singleton outputs and output 
groups, which can be combined in the same LFB class. 

</p>
<p>
Multiple separate singleton outputs are defined in an LFB class to 
model a pre-determined number of semantically different outputs. 
That is, the LFB class definition MUST include the number of 
outputs, implying the number of outputs is known when the LFB class 
is defined. Additional singleton outputs cannot be created at LFB 
instantiation time, nor can they be created on the fly after the LFB 
is instantiated. 

</p>
<p>
For example, an IPv4 LPM (Longest-Prefix-Matching) LFB may have one 
output(OUT) to send those packets for which the LPM look-up was 
successful, passing a META_ROUTEID as metadata; and have another 
output (EXCEPTIONOUT) for sending exception packets when the LPM 
look-up failed.  This example is depicted in <a class='info' href='#Figure3'>Figure&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Examples of LFBs with various output combinations.</span><span>)</span></a>.b.  
Packets emitted by these two outputs not only require different downstream 
treatment, but they are a result of two different conditions in the 
LFB and each output carries different metadata.  This concept 
assumes the number of distinct outputs is known when the LFB class 
is defined. For each singleton output, the LFB class definition 
defines the types of frames and metadata the output emits. 

</p>
<p>
An output group, on the other hand, is used to model the case where 
a flow of similar packets with an identical set of metadata needs to 
be split into multiple paths. In this case, the number of such paths 
is not known when the LFB class is defined because it is not an 
inherent property of the LFB class.  An output group consists of a 
number of outputs, called the output instances of the group, where 
all output instances share the same frame and metadata emission 
definitions (see <a class='info' href='#Figure3'>Figure&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Examples of LFBs with various output combinations.</span><span>)</span></a>.c).  Each output 
instance can connect to a different downstream LFB, just as if they 
were separate singleton outputs, but the number of output instances can 
differ between LFB instances of the same LFB class.  The class definition 
may include a lower and/or an upper limit on the number of outputs.  In 
addition, for configurable FEs, the FE capability information may define 
further limits on the number of instances in specific output groups 
for certain LFBs.  The actual number of output instances in a group 
is an attribute of the LFB instance, which is read-only for static 
topologies, and read-write for dynamic topologies.  The output 
instances in a group are numbered sequentially, from 0 to N-1, and 
are addressable from within the LFB.  The LFB has a built-in 
mechanism to select one specific output instance for each packet.  
This mechanism is described in the textual definition of the class 
and is typically configurable via some attributes of the LFB. 

</p>
<p>
For example, consider a re-director LFB, whose sole purpose is to 
direct packets to one of N downstream paths based on one of the 
metadata associated with each arriving packet.  Such an LFB is 
fairly versatile and can be used in many different places in a 
topology.  For example, a redirector can be used to divide the data 
path into an IPv4 and an IPv6 path based on a FRAMETYPE metadata 
(N=2), or to fork into color specific paths after metering using the 
COLOR metadata (red, yellow, green; N=3), etc. 

</p>
<p>
Using an output group in the above LFB class provides the desired 
flexibility to adapt each instance of this class to the required 
operation.  The metadata to be used as a selector for the output 
instance is a property of the LFB.  For each packet, the value of 
the specified metadata may be used as a direct index to the output 
instance.  Alternatively, the LFB may have a configurable selector 
table that maps a metadata value to output instance. 

</p>
<p>
Note that other LFBs may also use the output group concept to build 
in similar adaptive forking capability.  For example, a classifier 
LFB with one input and N outputs can be defined easily by using the 
output group concept.  Alternatively, a classifier LFB with one 
singleton output in combination with an explicit N-output re-
director LFB models the same processing behavior.  The decision of 
whether to use the output group model for a certain LFB class is 
left to the LFB class designers. 

</p>
<p>
The model allows the output group to be combined with other 
singleton output(s) in the same class, as demonstrated in 
<a class='info' href='#Figure3'>Figure&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Examples of LFBs with various output combinations.</span><span>)</span></a>.d. 
The LFB here has two types of outputs, OUT, for normal packet 
output, and EXCEPTIONOUT for packets that triggered some exception.  
The normal OUT has multiple instances, thus, it is an output group. 

</p>
<p>
In summary, the LFB class may define one output, multiple singleton 
outputs, one or more output groups, or a combination thereof. 
Multiple singleton outputs should be used when the LFB must provide 
for forking the datapath, and at least one of the following 
conditions hold: 

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li> 
the number of downstream directions are inherent from the 
definition of the class and hence fixed; 

</li>
<li>
the frame type and set of metadata emitted on any of the 
outputs are substantially different from what is emitted on  
the other  outputs (i.e., they cannot share frame-type and 
metadata definitions); 

</li>
</ul>
<p>
An output group is appropriate when the LFB must provide for forking 
the datapath, and at least one of the following conditions hold: 

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
the number of downstream directions is not known when the LFB 
class is defined; 

</li>
<li>
the frame type and set of metadata emitted on these outputs are 
sufficiently similar or ideally identical, such they can share 
the same output definition.

LFB Inputs</h3>

<p>
An LFB input is a conceptual port on an LFB where the LFB can 
receive information from other LFBs.  The information is typically a 
packet and associated metadata, although in some cases it might 
consist of only metadata, without any packet data. 

</p>
<p>
For LFB instances that receive packets from more than one other LFB 
instance (fan-in). There are three ways to model fan-in, all 
supported by the LFB model and can be combined in the same LFB: 

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
Implicit multiplexing via a single input 

</li>
<li>
Explicit multiplexing via multiple singleton inputs 

</li>
<li>
Explicit multiplexing via a group of inputs (input group) 

</li>
</ul>
<p>
The simplest form of multiplexing uses a singleton input 
(<a class='info' href='#Figure4'>Figure&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Input modeling concepts (examples).</span><span>)</span></a> .a).  Most LFBs will have only one singleton 
input.  Multiplexing into a single input is possible because the model 
allows more than one LFB output to connect to the same LFB input.  
This property applies to any LFB input without any special provisions 
in the LFB class.  Multiplexing into a single input is applicable when the 
packets from the upstream LFBs are similar in frame-type and 
accompanying metadata, and require similar processing.  Note that 
this model does not address how potential contention is handled when 
multiple packets arrive simultaneously.  If contention handling 
needs to be explicitly modeled, one of the other two modeling 
solutions must be used. 

</p>
<p>
The second method to model fan-in uses individually defined 
singleton inputs (<a class='info' href='#Figure4'>Figure&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Input modeling concepts (examples).</span><span>)</span></a>.b).  This model is meant 
for situations where the LFB needs to handle distinct types of packet 
streams, requiring input-specific handling inside the LFB, and where the 
number of such distinct cases is known when the LFB class is 
defined.  For example, a Layer 2 Decapsulation/Encapsulation LFB may 
have two inputs, one for receiving Layer 2 frames for decapsulation, 
and one for receiving Layer 3 frames for encapsulation.  This LFB 
type expects different frames (L2 vs. L3) at its inputs, each with 
different sets of metadata, and would thus apply different 
processing on frames arriving at these inputs.  This model is 
capable of explicitly addressing packet contention by defining how 
the LFB class handles the contending packets.

<p>
The third method to model fan-in uses the concept of an input group.  
The concept is similar to the output group introduced in the 
previous section, and is depicted in <a class='info' href='#Figure4'>Figure&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Input modeling concepts (examples).</span><span>)</span></a>.c.  
An input group consists of a number of input instances, all sharing 
the properties (same frame and metadata expectations).  
The input instances are numbered from 0 to N-1.  From the outside, 
these inputs appear as normal inputs, i.e., any compatible upstream 
LFB can connect its output to one of these inputs.  When a packet is 
presented to the LFB at a particular input instance, the index of the 
input where the packet arrived is known to the LFB and this information 
may be used in the internal processing.  For example, the input index can be 
used as a table selector, or as an explicit precedence selector to 
resolve contention.  As with output groups, the number of input 
instances in an input group is not defined in the LFB class.  
However, the class definition may include restrictions on the range 
of possible values.  In addition, if an FE supports configurable 
topologies, it may impose further limitations on the number of 
instances for a particular port group(s) of a particular LFB class.  
Within these limitations, different instances of the same class may 
have a different number of input instances.  The number of actual 
input instances in the group is an component defined in the LFB class, which 

</p>
<p>
is read-only for static topologies, and is read-write for 
configurable topologies. 

</p>
<p>
As an example for the input group, consider the Scheduler LFB 
depicted in <a class='info' href='#Figure3'>Figure&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Examples of LFBs with various output combinations.</span><span>)</span></a>.c.  Such an LFB receives packets 
from a number of Queue LFBs via a number of input instances, and uses 
the input index information to control contention resolution and scheduling. 

</p>
<p>
In summary, the LFB class may define one input, multiple singleton 
inputs, one or more input groups, or a combination thereof.  Any 
input allows for implicit multiplexing of similar packet streams via 
connecting multiple outputs to the same input.  Explicit multiple 
singleton inputs are useful when either the contention handling must 
be handled explicitly, or when the LFB class must receive and 
process a known number of distinct types of packet streams.  An 
input group is suitable when contention handling must be modeled 
explicitly, but the number of inputs are not inherent from the class 
(and hence is not known when the class is defined), or when it is 
critical for LFB operation to know exactly on which input the packet 
was received.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2.3"></a><h3>3.2.3.&nbsp;
Packet Type</h3>

<p>
When LFB classes are defined, the input and output packet formats 
(e.g., IPv4, IPv6, Ethernet, etc.) MUST be specified.  These are the 
types of packets a given LFB input is capable of receiving and 
processing, or a given LFB output is capable of producing.  This 
requires distinct packet types be uniquely labeled with a symbolic 
name and/or ID. 

</p>
<p>
Note that each LFB has a set of packet types that it operates on, 
but does not care whether the underlying implementation is passing a 
greater portion of the packets.  For example, an IPv4 LFB might only 
operate on IPv4 packets, but the underlying implementation may or 
may not be stripping the L2 header before handing it over -- whether 
that is happening or not is opaque to the CE.

Metadata</h3>

<p>
Metadata is the per-packet state that is passed from one LFB to 
another. The metadata is passed with the packet to assist subsequent 
LFBs to process that packet.  The ForCES model captures how the per-
packet state information is propagated from one LFB to other LFBs.  
Practically, such metadata propagation can happen within one FE, or 
cross the FE boundary between two interconnected FEs.  We believe 
that the same metadata model can be used for either situation; 
however, our focus here is for intra-FE metadata.

Metadata Vocabulary</h3>

<p>
Metadata has historically been understood to mean "data about data".  
While this definition is a start, it is inadequate to describe the 
multiple forms of metadata, which may appear within a complex 
network element.  The discussion here categorizes forms of metadata 
by two orthogonal axes. 

</p>
<p>	
The first axis is "internal" versus "external", which describes 
where the metadata exists in the network model or implementation.  
For example, a particular vendor implementation of an IPv4 forwarder 
may make decisions inside of a chip that are not visible externally.  
Those decisions are metadata for the packet that is "internal" to 
the chip.  When a packet is forwarded out of the chip, it may be 
marked with a traffic management header.  That header, which is 
metadata for the packet, is visible outside of the chip, and is 
therefore called "external" metadata. 

</p>
<p>
The second axis is "implicit" versus "expressed", which specifies 
whether or not the metadata has a visible physical representation. 
For example, the traffic management header described in the previous 
paragraph may be represented as a series of bits in some format, and 
that header is associated with the packet.  Those bits have physical 
representation, and are therefore "expressed" metadata.  If the 
metadata does not have a physical representation, it is called 
"implicit" metadata.  This situation occurs, for example, when a 
particular path through a network device is intended to be traversed 
only by particular kinds of packets, such as an IPv4 router.  An 
implementation may not mark every packet along this path as being of 
type "IPv4", but the intention of the designers is that every packet 
is of that type.  This understanding can be thought of as metadata 
about the packet, which is implicitly attached to the packet through 
the intent of the designers. 

</p>
<p>
In the ForCES model, we do not discuss or represent metadata 
"internal" to vendor implementations of LFBs.  Our focus is solely 
on metadata "external" to the LFBs, and therefore visible in the 
ForCES model.  The metadata discussed within this model may, or may 
not be visible outside of the particular FE implementing the LFB 
model.  In this regard, the scope of the metadata within ForCES is 
very narrowly defined. 

</p>
<p>
Note also that while we define metadata within this model, it is 
only a model.  There is no requirement that vendor implementations 
of ForCES use the exact metadata representations described in this 
document.  The only implementation requirement is that vendors 
implement the ForCES protocol, not the model.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2.4.2"></a><h3>3.2.4.2.&nbsp;
Metadata lifecycle within the ForCES model</h3>

<p>	
Each metadata can be conveniently modeled as a &#x3c;label, value&#x3e; pair, 
where the label identifies the type of information, (e.g., "color"), 
and its value holds the actual information (e.g., "red").  The tag 
here is shown as a textual label, but it can be replaced or 
associated with a unique numeric value (identifier).   

</p>
<p>
The metadata life-cycle is defined in this model using three types 
of events: "write", "read" and "consume".  The first "write" 
implicitly creates and initializes the value of the metadata, and 
hence starts the life-cycle.  The explicit "consume" event 
terminates the life-cycle.  Within the life-cycle, that is, after a 
"write" event, but before the next "consume" event, there can be an 
arbitrary number of "write" and "read" events.  These "read" and 
"write" events can be mixed in an arbitrary order within the life-
cycle.  Outside of the life-cycle of the metadata, that is, before 
the first "write" event, or between a "consume" event and the next 
"write" event, the metadata should be regarded non-existent or non-
initialized.  Thus, reading a metadata outside of its life-cycle is 
considered an error.  

</p>
<p>
To ensure inter-operability between LFBs, the LFB class 
specification must define what metadata the LFB class "reads" or 
"consumes" on its input(s) and what metadata it "produces" on its 
output(s).  For maximum extensibility, this definition should 
neither specify which LFBs the metadata is expected to come from for 
a consumer LFB, nor which LFBs are expected to consume metadata for 
a given producer LFB. 

</p>
<p>
While it is important to define the metadata types passing between 
LFBs, it is not appropriate to define the exact encoding mechanism 
used by LFBs for that metadata.  Different implementations are 
allowed to use different encoding mechanisms for metadata.  For 
example, one implementation may store metadata in registers or 
shared memory, while another implementation may encode metadata in-
band as a preamble in the packets.  In order to allow the CE to 
understand and control the meta-data related operations, the model 
represents each metadata tag as a 32-bit integer.  Each LFB 
definition indicates in its metadata declarations the 32-bit value 
associated with a given metadata tag.  Ensuring consistency of usage 
of tags is important, and outside the scope of the model. 

</p>
<p>

At any link between two LFBs, the packet is marked with a finite set 
of active metadata, where active means the metadata is within its 
life-cycle.  There are two corollaries of this model: 

</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>
No un-initialized metadata exists in the model. 

</li>
<li>
No more than one occurrence of each metadata tag can be 
associated with a packet at any given time. 

</li>
</ol>

<a name="rfc.section.3.2.4.3"></a><h3>3.2.4.3.&nbsp;
LFB Operations on Metadata</h3>

<p>
When the packet is processed by an LFB (i.e., between the time it is 
received and forwarded by the LFB), the LFB may perform read, write 
and/or consume operations on any active metadata associated with the 
packet.  If the LFB is considered to be a black box, one of the 
following operations is performed on each active metadata. 

</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<ul class="text">
<li>
IGNORE:           ignores and forwards the metadata 

</li>
<li>
READ:             reads and forwards the metadata 

</li>
<li>
READ/RE-WRITE:    reads, over-writes and forwards the metadata 

</li>
<li>
WRITE:            writes and forwards the metadata 
(can also be used to create new metadata) 

</li>
<li>
READ-AND-CONSUME: reads and consumes the metadata 

</li>
<li>
CONSUME           consumes metadata without reading 

</li>
</ul>
</dl></blockquote>
<p>
The last two operations terminate the life-cycle of the metadata, 
meaning that the metadata is not forwarded with the packet when the 
packet is sent to the next LFB. 

</p>
<p>
In our model, a new metadata is generated by an LFB when the LFB 
applies a WRITE operation to a metadata type that was not present 
when the packet was received by the LFB.  Such implicit creation may 
be unintentional by the LFB, that is, the LFB may apply the WRITE 
operation without knowing or caring if the given metadata existed or 
not.  If it existed, the metadata gets over-written; if it did not 
exist, the metadata is created. 

</p>
<p>	
For LFBs that insert packets into the model, WRITE is the only 
meaningful metadata operation. 

</p>
<p>
For LFBs that remove the packet from the model, they may either 
READ-AND-CONSUME (read) or CONSUME (ignore) each active metadata 
associated with the packet.

Metadata Production and Consumption </h3>

<p>
For a given metadata on a given packet path, there MUST be at least 
one producer LFB that creates that metadata and SHOULD be at least 
one consumer LFB that needs that metadata.  In this model, the 
producer and consumer LFBs of a metadata are not required to be 
adjacent.  In addition, there may be multiple producers and 
consumers for the same metadata.  When a packet path involves 
multiple producers of the same metadata, then subsequent producers 
overwrite that metadata value. 

</p>
<p>	
The metadata that is produced by an LFB is specified by the LFB 
class definition on a per output port group basis.  A producer may 
always generate the metadata on the port group, or may generate it 
only under certain conditions.  We call the former an 
"unconditional" metadata, whereas the latter is a "conditional" 
metadata.  In the case of conditional metadata, it should be 
possible to determine from the definition of the LFB when a 
"conditional" metadata is produced. 
The consumer behavior of an LFB, that is, the metadata that the LFB 
needs for its operation, is defined in the LFB class definition on a 
per input port group basis.  An input port group may "require" a 
given metadata, or may treat it as "optional" information.  In the 
latter case, the LFB class definition MUST explicitly define what 
happens if an optional metadata is not provided.  One approach is to 
specify a default value for each optional metadata, and assume that 
the default value is used if the metadata is not provided with the 
packet. 

</p>
<p>	
When a consumer LFB requires a given metadata, it has dependencies 
on its up-stream LFBs.  That is, the consumer LFB can only function 
if there is at least one producer of that metadata and no 
intermediate LFB consumes the metadata. 

</p>
<p>
The model should expose these inter-dependencies.  Furthermore, it 
should be possible to take inter-dependencies into consideration 
when constructing LFB topologies, and also that the dependencies can 
be verified when validating topologies. 

</p>
<p>
For extensibility reasons, the LFB specification SHOULD define what 
metadata the LFB requires without specifying which LFB(s) it expects 
a certain metadata to come from.  Similarly, LFBs SHOULD specify 
what metadata they produce without specifying which LFBs the 
metadata is meant for. 

</p>
<p>
When specifying the metadata tags, some harmonization effort must be 
made so that the producer LFB class uses the same tag as its 
intended consumer(s), or vice versa.

Fixed, Variable and Configurable Tag  </h3>

<p>
When the produced metadata is defined for a given LFB class, most 
metadata will be specified with a fixed tag.  For example, a Rate 
Meter LFB will always produce the "Color" metadata. 

</p>
<p>
A small subset of LFBs need the capability to produce one or more of 
their metadata with tags that are not fixed in the LFB class 
definition, but instead can be selected per LFB instance.  An 
example of such an LFB class is a Generic Classifier LFB.  We call 
this capability "variable tag metadata production".  If an LFB 

</p>
<p>
produces metadata with a variable tag, the corresponding LFB 
attribute, called the tag selector, specifies the tag for each such 
metadata.  This mechanism improves the versatility of certain multi-
purpose LFB classes, since it allows the same LFB class to be used 
in different topologies, producing the right metadata tags according 
to the needs of the topology.  This selection of tags is variable in 
that the produced output may have any number of different tags.  The 
meaning of the various tags is still defined by the metadata 
declaration associated with the LFB class definition.  This also 
allows the CE to correctly set the tag values in the table to match 
the declared meanings of the metadata tag values. 

</p>
<p>
Depending on the capability of the FE, the tag selector can be 
either a read-only or a read-write attribute.  If the selector is 
read-only, the tag cannot be modified by the CE.  If the selector is 
read-write, the tag can be configured by the CE, hence we call this 
"configurable tag metadata production."  Note that using this 
definition, configurable tag metadata production is a subset of 
variable tag metadata production. 

</p>
<p>
Similar concepts can be introduced for the consumer LFBs to satisfy 
different metadata needs.  Most LFB classes will specify their 
metadata needs using fixed metadata tags.  For example, a Next Hop 
LFB may always require a "NextHopId" metadata; but the Redirector 
LFB may need a "ClassID" metadata in one instance, and a 
"ProtocolType" metadata in another instance as a basis for selecting 
the right output port.  In this case, an LFB attribute is used to 
provide the required metadata tag at run-time.  This metadata tag 
selector attribute may be read-only or read-write, depending on the 
capabilities of the LFB instance and the FE.

Metadata Usage Categories </h3>

<p>
Depending on the role and usage of a metadata, various amounts of 
encoding information MUST be provided when the metadata is defined, 
where some cases offer less flexibility in the value selection than 
others. 

</p>
<p>
	There are three types of metadata related to metadata usage: 

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
Relational (or binding) metadata 

</li>
<li>
Enumerated metadata 

</li>
<li>
Explicit/external value metadata 

</li>
</ul>
<p>
The purpose of the relational metadata is to refer in one LFB 
instance (producer LFB) to a "thing" in another downstream LFB 
instance (consumer LFB), where the "thing" is typically an entry in 
a table attribute of the consumer LFB. 

</p>
<p>	
	
For example, the Prefix Lookup LFB executes an LPM search using its 
prefix table and resolves to a next-hop reference.  This reference 
needs to be passed as metadata by the Prefix Lookup LFB (producer) 
to the Next Hop LFB (consumer), and must refer to a specific entry 
in the next-hop table within the consumer. 

</p>
<p>
Expressing and propagating such a binding relationship is probably 
the most common usage of metadata.  One or more objects in the 
producer LFB are bound to a specific object in the consumer LFB.  
Such a relationship is established by the CE explicitly by properly 
configuring the attributes in both LFBs.  Available methods include 
the following: 

</p>
<p>
The binding may be expressed by tagging the involved objects in both 
LFBs with the same unique, but otherwise arbitrary, identifier.  The 
value of the tag is explicitly configured by the CE by writing the 
value into both LFBs, and this value is also carried by the metadata 
between the LFBs. 

</p>
<p>
Another way of setting up binding relations is to use a naturally 
occurring unique identifier of the consumer's object as a reference 
and as a value of the metadata (e.g., the array index of a table 
entry).  In this case, the index is either read or inferred by the 
CE by communicating with the consumer LFB.  Once the CE obtains the 
index, it needs to write it into the producer LFB to establish the 
binding. 

</p>
<p>
Important characteristics of the binding usage of metadata are: 

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
The value of the metadata shows up in the CE-FE communication 
for both the consumer and the producer.  That is, the metadata 
value MUST be carried over the ForCES protocol.  Using the 
tagging technique, the value is written to both LFBs.  Using 
the other technique, the value is written to only the producer 
LFB and may be READ from the consumer LFB. 

</li>
<li>
The metadata value is irrelevant to the CE, the binding is 
simply expressed by using the same value at the consumer and 
producer LFBs. 

</li>
<li>
Hence the metadata definition is not required to include value 
assignments.  The only exception is when some special value(s) 
of the metadata must be reserved to convey special events.  
Even though these special cases must be defined with the 
metadata specification, their encoded values can be selected 
arbitrarily.  For example, for the Prefix Lookup LFB example, a 
special value may be reserved to signal the NO-MATCH case, and 
the value of zero may be assigned for this purpose. 

</li>
</ul>
<p>	
The second class of metadata is the enumerated type.  An example is 
the "Color" metadata that is produced by a Meter LFB. As the name 
suggests, enumerated metadata has a relatively small number of 
possible values, each with a specific meaning.  All possible cases 
must be enumerated when defining this class of metadata.  Although a 
value encoding must be included in the specification, the actual 
values can be selected arbitrarily (e.g., &#x3c;Red=0, Yellow=1, Green=2&#x3e; 
and &#x3c;Red=3, Yellow=2, Green 1&#x3e; would be both valid encodings, what 
is important is that an encoding is specified). 

</p>
<p>	
The value of the enumerated metadata may or may not be conveyed via 
the ForCES protocol between the CE and FE. 

</p>
<p>
The third class of metadata is the explicit type.  This refers to 
cases where the metadata value is explicitly used by the consumer 
LFB to change some packet header fields.  In other words, the value 
has a direct and explicit impact on some field and will be visible 
externally when the packet leaves the NE.  Examples are: TTL 
increment given to a Header Modifier LFB, and DSCP value for a 
Remarker LFB.  For explicit metadata, the value encoding MUST be 
explicitly provided in the metadata definition.  The values cannot 
be selected arbitrarily and should conform to what is commonly 
expected.  For example, a TTL increment metadata should be encoded 
as zero for the no increment case, one for the single increment 
case, etc.  A DSCP metadata should use 0 to encode DSCP=0, 1 to 
encode DSCP=1, etc.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2.5"></a><h3>3.2.5.&nbsp;
LFB Events</h3>

<p>
During operation, various conditions may occur that can be detected 
by LFBs.  Examples range from link failure or restart to timer 
expiration in special purpose LFBs.  The CE may wish to be notified 
of the occurrence of such events.  The PL protocol provides for such 
notifications.  The LFB definition includes the necessary 
declarations of events.  The declarations include identifiers 
necessary for subscribing to events (so that the CE can indicate to 
the FE which events it wishes to receive) and to indicate in event 
notification messages which event is being reported. 

</p>
<p>
The declaration of an event defines a condition that an FE can 
detect, and may report.  From a conceptual point of view, event 
processing is split into triggering (the detection of the condition) 
and reporting (the generation of the notification of the event.)  In 
between these two conceptual points there is event filtering.  
Properties associated with the event in the LFB instance can define 
filtering conditions to suppress the reporting of that event.  The 
model thus describes event processing as if events always occur, and 
filtering may suppress reporting.  Implementations may function in 
this manner, or may have more complex logic that eliminates some 
event processing if the reporting would be suppressed.  Any 
implementation producing an effect equivalent to the model 
description is valid

</p>
<p>
The reports with events are designed to allow for the common, 
closely related information that the CE can be strongly expected to 
need to react to the event.  It is not intended to carry information 
the CE already has, nor large volumes of information, nor 
information related in complex fashions.

 LFB Component Properties </h3>

<p>
LFBs are made up of components, containing the information that the CE 
needs to see and / or change about the functioning of the LFB.  
These components, as described in detail elsewhere, may be basic 
values, complex structures (containing multiple components themselves,
each of which can be values, structures, or tables), or tables (which contain 
values, structures or tables.)  Some of these components are optional.  Some 
components may be readable or writeable at the discretion of the FE 
implementation.  The CE needs to know these properties.  
Additionally, certain kinds of components (arrays / tables, aliases,
and events as of this writing) have additional property information
that the CE 
may need to read or write.  This model defines the structure of the 
property information for all defined data types.

LFB Versioning</h3>

<p>
LFB class versioning is a method to enable incremental evolution of 
LFB classes. In general, an FE is not allowed to contain an LFB 
instance for more than one version of a particular class.  
Inheritance (discussed next in <a class='info' href='#Section326'>Section&nbsp;3.2.6<span> (</span><span class='info'> LFB Component Properties </span><span>)</span></a>) has special 
rules. If an FE datapath model containing an LFB instance of a particular 
class C also simultaneously contains an LFB instance of a class C' 
inherited from class C; C could have a different version than C'. 

</p>
<p>
LFB class versioning is supported by requiring a version string in 
the class definition.  CEs may support multiple versions of a 
particular LFB class to provide backward compatibility, but FEs MUST 
NOT support more than one version of a particular class. 

</p>
<p>
Versioning is not restricted to making backwards compatible changes.  
It is specifically expected to be used to make changes that cannot 
be represented by inheritance.  Often this will be to correct 
errors, and hence may not be backwards compatible.  It may also be 
used to remove components which are not considered useful 
(particularly if they were previously mandatory, and hence were an 
implementation impediment.)

<a name="rfc.section.3.2.8"></a><h3>3.2.8.&nbsp;
LFB Inheritance </h3>

<p>
LFB class inheritance is supported in the FE model as a method to 
define new LFB classes.  This also allows FE vendors to add vendor-
specific extensions to standardized LFBs.  An LFB class 
specification MUST specify the base class and version number it 
inherits from (the default is the base LFB class).  Multiple-
inheritance is not allowed, however, to avoid unnecessary 
complexity.  

</p>
<p>
Inheritance should be used only when there is significant reuse of 
the base LFB class definition.  A separate LFB class should be 
defined if little or no reuse is possible between the derived and 
the base LFB class. 

</p>
<p>
An interesting issue related to class inheritance is backward 
compatibility between a descendant and an ancestor class.   Consider 
the following hypothetical scenario where a standardized LFB class 
"L1" exists.  Vendor A builds an FE that implements LFB "L1" and 
vendor B builds a CE that can recognize and operate on LFB "L1".  
Suppose that a new LFB class, "L2", is defined based on the existing 
"L1" class by extending its capabilities incrementally. Let us 
examine the FE backward compatibility issue by considering what 
would happen if vendor B upgrades its FE from "L1" to "L2" and 
vendor C's CE is not changed.  The old L1-based CE can interoperate 
with the new L2-based FE if the derived LFB class "L2" is indeed 
backward compatible with the base class "L1".   

</p>
<p>
The reverse scenario is a much less problematic case, i.e., when CE 
vendor B upgrades to the new LFB class "L2", but the FE is not 
upgraded.  Note that as long as the CE is capable of working with 
older LFB classes, this problem does not affect the model; hence we 
will use the term "backward compatibility" to refer to the first 
scenario concerning FE backward compatibility. 

</p>
<p>
Backward compatibility can be designed into the inheritance model by 
constraining LFB inheritance to require the derived class be a 
functional superset of the base class (i.e. the derived class can 
only add functions to the base class, but not remove functions).  
Additionally, the following mechanisms are required to support FE 
backward compatibility: 

</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>
When detecting an LFB instance of an LFB type that is unknown 
to the CE, the CE MUST be able to query the base class of such 
an LFB from the FE. 

</li>
<li>
The LFB instance on the FE SHOULD support a backward 
compatibility mode (meaning the LFB instance reverts itself 
back to the base class instance), and the CE SHOULD be able to 
configure the LFB to run in such a mode.

FE Datapath Modeling </h3>

<p>
Packets coming into the FE from ingress ports generally flow through 
multiple LFBs before leaving out of the egress ports.  How an FE 
treats a packet depends on many factors, such as type of the packet 
(e.g., IPv4, IPv6 or MPLS), actual header values, time of arrival, 
etc.  The result of LFB processing may have an impact on how the 
packet is to be treated in downstream LFBs.  This differentiation of 
packet treatment downstream can be conceptualized as having 
alternative datapaths in the FE.  For example, the result of a 6-
tuple classification performed by a classifier LFB could control 
which rate meter is applied to the packet by a rate meter LFB in a 
later stage in the datapath.   

</p>
<p>
LFB topology is a directed graph representation of the logical 
datapaths within an FE, with the nodes representing the LFB 
instances and the directed link depicting the packet flow direction 
from one LFB to the next.  <a class='info' href='#Section331'>Section&nbsp;3.3.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Alternative Approaches for Modeling FE Datapaths </span><span>)</span></a> discusses how the FE

Alternative Approaches for Modeling FE Datapaths </h3>

<p>
There are two basic ways to express the differentiation in packet 
treatment within an FE, one represents the datapath directly and 
graphically (topological approach) and the other utilizes metadata 
(the encoded state approach).

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
Topological Approach 

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Using this approach, differential packet treatment is expressed by 
splitting the LFB topology into alternative paths.  In other 
words, if the result of an LFB operation controls how the packet 
is further processed, then such an LFB will have separate output 
ports, one for each alternative treatment, connected to separate 
sub-graphs, each expressing the respective treatment downstream. 

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>	
Encoded State Approach 

</li>
</ul>
<p>
An alternate way of expressing differential treatment is by using 
metadata.  The result of the operation of an LFB can be encoded in 
a metadata, which is passed along with the packet to downstream 
LFBs.  A downstream LFB, in turn, can use the metadata and its 
value (e.g., as an index into some table) to determine how to 
treat the packet. 

</p>
<p>
Theoretically, either approach could substitute for the other, so 
one could consider using a single pure approach to describe all 
datapaths in an FE.  However, neither model by itself results in the 
best representation for all practically relevant cases.  For a given 
FE with certain logical datapaths, applying the two different 
modeling approaches will result in very different looking LFB 
topology graphs.  A model using only the topological approach may 
require a very large graph with many links or paths, and nodes 
(i.e., LFB instances) to express all alternative datapaths.  On the 
other hand, a model using only the encoded state model would be 
restricted to a string of LFBs, which is not an intuitive way to 
describe different datapaths (such as MPLS and IPv4).  Therefore, a 
mix of these two approaches will likely be used for a practical 
model.  In fact, as we illustrate below, the two approaches can be 
mixed even within the same LFB.  

</p>
<p>
Using a simple example of a classifier with N classification outputs 
followed by other LFBs, <a class='info' href='#Figure5'>Figure&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>An example of how to model FE datapaths </span><span>)</span></a>(a) shows what 
the LFB topology looks like when using the pure topological approach.  
Each output from the classifier goes to one of the N LFBs where no 
metadata is needed.  The topological approach is simple, straightforward 
and graphically intuitive.  However, if N is large and the N nodes 
following the classifier (LFB#1, LFB#2, ..., LFB#N) all belong to 
the same LFB type (e.g., meter), but each has its own independent 
components, the encoded state approach gives a much simpler topology 
representation, as shown in <a class='info' href='#Figure5'>Figure&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>An example of how to model FE datapaths </span><span>)</span></a>(b).  The encoded 
state approach requires that a table of N rows of meter components is 
provided in the Meter node itself, with each row representing the 
attributes for one meter instance.  A metadata M is also needed to pass 
along with the packet P from the classifier to the meter, so that the 
meter can use M as a look-up key (index) to find the corresponding row 
of the attributes that should be used for any particular packet P. 

</p>
<p>
What if those N nodes (LFB#1, LFB#2, ..., LFB#N) are not of the same 
type? For example, if LFB#1 is a queue while the rest are all 
meters, what is the best way to represent such datapaths?  While it 
is still possible to use either the pure topological approach or the 
pure encoded state approach, the natural combination of the two 
appears to be the best option. <a class='info' href='#Figure5'>Figure&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>An example of how to model FE datapaths </span><span>)</span></a>(c) depicts 
two different 
functional datapaths using the topological approach while leaving 
the N-1 meter instances distinguished by metadata only, as shown in 
<a class='info' href='#Figure5'>Figure&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>An example of how to model FE datapaths </span><span>)</span></a>(c).

<p>
From this example, we demonstrate that each approach has a distinct 
advantage depending on the situation.  Using the encoded state 
approach, fewer connections are typically needed between a fan-out 
node and its next LFB instances of the same type because each packet 
carries metadata the following nodes can interpret and hence invoke 

</p>
<p>
a different packet treatment.  For those cases, a pure topological 
approach forces one to build elaborate graphs with many more 
connections and often results in an unwieldy graph.  On the other 
hand, a topological approach is the most intuitive for representing 
functionally different datapaths. 

</p>
<p>
For complex topologies, a combination of the two is the most 
flexible.  A general design guideline is provided to indicate which 
approach is best used for a particular situation.  The topological 
approach should primarily be used when the packet datapath forks to 
distinct LFB classes (not just distinct parameterizations of the 
same LFB class), and when the fan-outs do not require changes, such 
as adding/removing LFB outputs, or require only very infrequent 
changes.  Configuration information that needs to change frequently 
should be expressed by using the internal attributes of one or more 
LFBs (and hence using the encoded state approach).

<p>
It is important to point out that the LFB topology described here is 
the logical topology, not the physical topology of how the FE 
hardware is actually laid out.  Nevertheless, the actual 
implementation may still influence how the functionality is mapped 
to the LFB topology.  <a class='info' href='#Figure6'>Figure&nbsp;6<span> (</span><span class='info'>An LFB topology example.</span><span>)</span></a> shows one simple FE example.  
In this example, an IP-in-IP packet from an IPSec application like VPN may 
go to the classifier first and have the classification done based on 
the outer IP header; upon being classified as an IP-in-IP packet, 
the packet is then sent to a decapsulator to strip off the outer IP 

</p>
<p>
header, followed by a classifier again to perform classification on 
the inner IP header. If the same classifier hardware or software is 
used for both outer and inner IP header classification with the same 
set of filtering rules, a logical loop is naturally present in the 
LFB topology, as shown in <a class='info' href='#Figure6'>Figure&nbsp;6<span> (</span><span class='info'>An LFB topology example.</span><span>)</span></a>(a).  However, if the 
classification is implemented by two different pieces of hardware or 
software with different filters (i.e., one set of filters for the 
outer IP header and another set for the inner IP header), then it is 
more natural to model them as two different instances of classifier 
LFB, as shown in <a class='info' href='#Figure6'>Figure&nbsp;6<span> (</span><span class='info'>An LFB topology example.</span><span>)</span></a>(b). 

</p>
<p>
To distinguish between multiple instances of the same LFB class, 
each LFB instance has its own LFB instance ID.  One way to encode 
the LFB instance ID is to encode it as x.y where x is the LFB class 
ID and y is the instance ID within each LFB class.

 Configuring the LFB Topology </h3>

<p>
While there is little doubt that an individual LFB must be 
configurable, the configurability question is more complicated for 
LFB topology.  Since the LFB topology is really the graphic 
representation of the datapaths within an FE, configuring the LFB 
topology means dynamically changing the datapaths, including 
changing the LFBs along the datapaths on an FE (e.g., creating, 
instantiating or deleting LFBs) and setting up or deleting 
interconnections between outputs of upstream LFBs to inputs of 
downstream LFBs.   

</p>
<p>
Why would the datapaths on an FE ever change dynamically?  The 
datapaths on an FE are set up by the CE to provide certain data 
plane services (e.g., DiffServ, VPN, etc.) to the Network Element's 
(NE) customers.  The purpose of reconfiguring the datapaths is to 
enable the CE to customize the services the NE is delivering at run 
time.  The CE needs to change the datapaths when the service 
requirements change, such as adding a new customer or when an 
existing customer changes their service.  However, note that not all 
datapath changes result in changes in the LFB topology graph. 
Changes in the graph are dependent on the approach used to map the 
datapaths into LFB topology.  As discussed in 3.3.1, the topological 
approach and encoded state approach can result in very different 
looking LFB topologies for the same datapaths.  In general, an LFB 
topology based on a pure topological approach is likely to 
experience more frequent topology reconfiguration than one based on 
an encoded state approach.  However, even an LFB topology based 
entirely on an encoded state approach may have to change the 
topology at times, for example, to bypass some LFBs or insert new 
LFBs.  Since a mix of these two approaches is used to model the 
datapaths, LFB topology reconfiguration is considered an important 
aspect of the FE model.  

</p>
<p>
We want to point out that allowing a configurable LFB topology in 
the FE model does not mandate that all FEs are required to have this 
capability.  Even if an FE supports configurable LFB topology, the 
FE may impose limitations on what can actually be configured.  
Performance-optimized hardware implementations may have zero or very 
limited configurability, while FE implementations running on network 
processors may provide more flexibility and configurability.  It is 
entirely up to the FE designers to decide whether or not the FE 
actually implements reconfiguration and if so, how much.  Whether a 
simple runtime switch is used to enable or disable (i.e., bypass) 
certain LFBs, or more flexible software reconfiguration is used, is 
implementation detail internal to the FE and outside of the scope of 
FE model.  In either case, the CE(s) MUST be able to learn the FE's 
configuration capabilities.  Therefore, the FE model MUST provide a 
mechanism for describing the LFB topology configuration capabilities 
of an FE.  
These capabilities may include (see <a class='info' href='#Section5'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>FE Components and Capabilities</span><span>)</span></a> for full 
details): 

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
Which LFB classes the FE can instantiate 

</li>
<li>
Maximum number of instances of the same LFB class that can be 
created 

</li>
<li>
Any topological limitations, For example: 

</li>
<ul class="text">
<li>
    The maximum number of instances of the same class or any 
    class that can be created on any given branch of the graph 
    
</li>
<li>
    Ordering restrictions on LFBs (e.g., any instance of LFB 
    class A must be always downstream of any instance of LFB 
    class B).
    
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Note that even when the CE is allowed to configure LFB topology for 
the FE, the CE is not expected to be able to interpret an arbitrary 
LFB topology and determine which specific service or application 
(e.g. VPN, DiffServ, etc.) is supported by the FE.  However, once 
the CE understands the coarse capability of an FE, the CE MUST 
configure the LFB topology to implement the network service the NE 
is supposed to provide.  Thus, the mapping the CE has to understand 
is from the high level NE service to a specific LFB topology, not 
the other way around. The CE is not expected to have the ultimate 
intelligence to translate any high level service policy into the 
configuration data for the FEs.  However, it is conceivable that 
within a given network service domain, a certain amount of 
intelligence can be programmed into the CE to give the CE a general 
understanding of the LFBs involved to allow the translation from a 
high level service policy to the low level FE configuration to be 
done automatically.  Note that this is considered an implementation 
issue internal to the control plane and outside the scope of the FE 
model. Therefore, it is not discussed any further in this draft.

(c)  Another LFB topology as configured by the CE and

</pre></div><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" align="center"><tr><td align="center"><font face="monaco, MS Sans Serif" size="1"><b>&nbsp;Figure&nbsp;7: An example of configuring LFB topology&nbsp;</b></font><br /></td></tr></table><hr class="insert" />

<p>
<a class='info' href='#Figure7'>Figure&nbsp;7<span> (</span><span class='info'>An example of configuring LFB topology</span><span>)</span></a> shows an example where a QoS-enabled router 
has several line cards that have a few ingress ports and egress ports, a 
specialized classification chip, a network processor containing 
codes for FE blocks like meter, marker, dropper, counter, queue, 
scheduler and Ipv4 forwarder.  Some of the LFB topology is already 
fixed and has to remain static due to the physical layout of the 
line cards.  For example, all of the ingress ports might be hard-
wired into the classification chip so all packets flow from the 
ingress port into the classification engine.  On the other hand, the 
LFBs on the network processor and their execution order are 
programmable. However, certain capacity limits and linkage 
constraints could exist between these LFBs. Examples of the capacity 
limits might be: 8 meters; 16 queues in one FE; the scheduler can 
handle at most up to 16 queues; etc.  The linkage constraints might 
dictate that the classification engine may be followed by a meter, 
marker, dropper, counter, queue or IPv4 forwarder, but not a 
scheduler; queues can only be followed by a scheduler; a scheduler 
must be followed by the IPv4 forwarder; the last LFB in the datapath 
before going into the egress ports must be the IPv4 forwarder, etc.  

</p>
<p>
Once the FE reports these capabilities and capacity limits to the 
CE, it is now up to the CE to translate the QoS policy into a 
desirable configuration for the FE.  <a class='info' href='#Figure7'>Figure&nbsp;7<span> (</span><span class='info'>An example of configuring LFB topology</span><span>)</span></a>(a) depicts 
the FE capability while 7(b) and 7(c) depict two different topologies that 
the CE may request the FE to configure.  Note that both the ingress 
and egress are omitted in (b) and (c) to simplify the 
representation.  The topology in 7(c) is considerably more complex 
than 7(b) but both are feasible within the FE capabilities, and so 
the FE should accept either configuration request from the CE.

 Model and Schema for LFB Classes</h3>

<p>
The main goal of the FE model is to provide an abstract, generic, 
modular, implementation-independent representation of the FEs.  This 
is facilitated using the concept of LFBs, which are instantiated 
from LFB classes.  LFB classes and associated definitions will be 
provided in a collection of XML documents. The collection of these 
XML documents is called a LFB class library, and each document is 
called an LFB class library document (or library document, for 
short).  Each of the library documents will conform to the schema 
presented in this section.  The root element of the library document 
is the &#x3c;LFBLibrary&#x3e; element. 

</p>
<p>
It is not expected that library documents will be exchanged between 
FEs and CEs "over-the-wire".  But the model will serve as an 
important reference for the design and development of the CEs 
(software) and FEs (mostly the software part).  It will also serve 
as a design input when specifying the ForCES protocol elements for 
CE-FE communication.

<p>
A namespace is needed to uniquely identify the LFB type in the LFB

<a name="rfc.section.4.2"></a><h3>4.2.&nbsp;
<LFBLibrary> Element</h3>

<p>
The &#x3c;LFBLibrary&#x3e element serves as a root element of all library 
documents. It contains one or more of the following main XML elements: 

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
&#x3c;frameTypeDefs&#x3e; for the frame declarations; 

</li>
<li>
&#x3c;dataTypeDefs&#x3e; for defining common data types; 

</li>
<li>
&#x3c;metadataDefs&#x3e; for defining metadata, and 

</li>
<li>
&#x3c;LFBClassDefs&#x3e; for defining LFB classes. 

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Each element is optional, that is, one library document may contain 
only metadata definitions, another may contain only LFB class 
definitions, yet another may contain all of the above. 

</p>
<p>    
In addition to the above main elements, a library document can import 
other library documents if it needs to refer to definitions 
contained in the included document.  This concept is similar to the 
"#include" directive in C.  Importing is expressed by the use of
&#x3c;load&#x3e; 
elements, which must precede all the above elements in the document.  
For unique referencing, each LFBLibrary instance document has a 
unique label defined in the "provide" attribute of the LFBLibrary 
element. 

</p>
<p>
The &#x3c;LFBLibrary&#x3e; element also includes an optional
&#x3c;description&#x3e; 
element, which can be used to provide textual description about the 
library document. 

</p>
<p>
The following is a skeleton of a library document: 

</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

    &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

<load> Element</h3>

<p>
This element is used to refer to another LFB library document.   
Similar to the "#include" directive in C, this makes the objects 
(metadata types, data types, etc.) defined in the referred library 
document available for referencing in the current document. 

</p>
<p>
The load element MUST contain the label of the library document to 
be included and may contain a URL to specify where the library can 
be retrieved.  The load element can be repeated unlimited times.  
Three examples for the &#x3c;load&#x3e; elements: 

</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
&lt;load library="a_library"/&gt;

<frameDefs> Element for Frame Type Declarations </h3>

<p>
Frame names are used in the LFB definition to define the types of
frames the LFB expects at its input port(s) and emits at its output 
port(s).  The &#x3c;frameDefs&#x3e; optional element in the library document 
contains one or more &#x3c;frameDef&#x3e; elements, each declaring one frame 
type. 

</p>
<p>
Each frame definition MUST contain a unique name (NMTOKEN) and a 
brief synopsis.  In addition, an optional detailed description may 
be provided. 

</p>
<p>
Uniqueness of frame types MUST be ensured among frame types defined 
in the same library document and in all directly or indirectly 
included library documents.  		

</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
The following example defines two frame types:

&lt;frameDefs&gt;
  &lt;frameDef&gt;
   &lt;name&gt;ipv4&lt;/name&gt;
   &lt;synopsis&gt;IPv4 packet&lt;/synopsis&gt;
   &lt;description&gt;
    This frame type refers to an IPv4 packet.
  &lt;/description&gt;
 &lt;/frameDef&gt;
  &lt;frameDef&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;ipv6&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;synopsis&gt;IPv6 packet&lt;/synopsis&gt;

<dataTypeDefs> Element for Data Type Definitions</h3>

<p>
The (optional) &#x3C;dataTypeDefs&#x3e; element can be used to define commonly 
used data types. It contains one or more &#x3C;dataTypeDef&#x3e; elements, 
each defining a data type with a unique name. Such data types can be 
used in several places in the library documents, including: 

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
Defining other data types 

</li>
<li>
Defining attributes of LFB classes 

</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is similar to the concept of having a common header file for 
shared data types. 

</p>
<p>
Each &#x3C;dataTypeDef&#x3E; element MUST contain a unique name (NMTOKEN), a 
brief synopsis, an optional longer description, and a type 
definition element.  The name MUST be unique among all data types 
defined in the same library document and in any directly or 
indirectly included library documents. For example: 

</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
&lt;dataTypeDefs&gt;
  &lt;dataTypeDef&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;ieeemacaddr&lt;/name&gt;
     &lt;synopsis&gt;48-bit IEEE MAC address&lt;/synopsis&gt;
      ... type definition ...
  &lt;/dataTypeDef&gt;
  &lt;dataTypeDef&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;ipv4addr&lt;/name&gt;
     &lt;synopsis&gt;IPv4 address&lt;/synopsis&gt;
     ... type definition ...
  &lt;/dataTypeDef&gt;
  ...
&lt;/dataTypeDefs&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>
There are two kinds of data types: atomic and compound.  Atomic data 
types are appropriate for single-value variables (e.g. integer, 
string, byte array). 

</p>
<p>
The following built-in atomic data types are provided, but 
additional atomic data types can be defined with the &#x3C;typeRef&#x3E; and 
&#x3C;atomic&#x3E; elements: 

</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

       uint32                   32-bit unsigned integer
       int64                    64-bit signed integer

                                contain fewer than N octets.  Hence
                                the encoded value will always have
                                a length.

       float64                  64-bit IEEE floating point number
</pre></div>
<p>
These built-in data types can be readily used to define metadata or 
LFB attributes, but can also be used as building blocks when 
defining new data types.  The boolean data type is defined here 
because it is so common, even though it can be built by sub-ranging 
the uchar data type. 

</p>
<p>
       
Compound data types can build on atomic data types and other 
compound data types.  Compound data types can be defined in one of 
four ways.  They may be defined as an array of components of some 
compound or atomic data type.  They may be a structure of named 
components of compound or atomic data types (ala C structures).  They 
may be a union of named components of compound or atomic data types 
(ala C unions).  They may also be defined as augmentations 
(explained below in 4.5.6) of existing compound data types. 

</p>
<p>
Given that the FORCES protocol will be getting and setting component 
values, all atomic data types used here must be able to be conveyed 
in the FORCES protocol.  Further, the FORCES protocol will need a 
mechanism to convey compound data types.  However, the details of 
such representations are for the protocol document to define, not 
the model document.  Strings and octetstrings must be conveyed with 
their length, as they are not delimited, and are variable length. 

</p>
<p>
With regard to strings, this model defines a small set of 
restrictions and definitions on how they are structured.  String and 
octetstring length limits can be specified in the LFB Class 
definitions.  The component properties for string and octetstring 
components also contain actual lengths and length limits.  This 
duplication of limits is to allow for implementations with smaller 
limits than the maximum limits specified in the LFB Class 
definition.  In all cases, these lengths are specified in octets, 
not in characters.  In terms of protocol operation, as long as the 
specified length is within the FE's supported capabilities, the FE 
stores the contents of a string exactly as provided by the CE, and 
returns those contents when requested.  No canonicalization, 
transformations, or equivalences are performed by the FE.  components 
of type string (or string[n]) may be used to hold identifiers for 
correlation with components in other LFBs.  In such cases, an exact 
octet for octet match is used.  No equivalences are used by the FE 
or CE in performing that matching.  The ForCES protocol does not 
perform or require validation of the content of UTF-8 strings.  
However, UTF-8 strings SHOULD be encoded in the shortest form to 
avoid potential security issues described in <a class='info' href='#UNICODE'>[12]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Davis, M. and M. Suignard, &ldquo;UNICODE Security Considerations,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>.  
Any entity 
displaying such strings is expected to perform its own validation 
(for example for correct multi-byte characters, and for ensuring 
that the string does not end in the middle of a multi-byte 
sequence.)  Specific LFB class definitions may restrict the valid 
contents of a string as suited to the particular usage (for example, 
a component that holds a DNS name would be restricted to hold only 
octets valid in such a name.)  FEs should validate the contents of 
SET requests for such restricted components at the time the set is 
performed, just as range checks for range limited components are 
performed.  The ForCES protocol behavior defines the normative 
processing for requests using that protocol.   

</p>
<p>
For the definition of the actual type in the &#x3c;dataTypeDef&#x3e; element, 
the following elements are available: &#x3c;typeRef&#x3e;, &#x3c;atomic&#x3e;,
&#x3c;array&#x3e;, &#x3c;struct&#x3e;, and &#x3c;union&#x3e;. 

</p>
<p>
The predefined type alias is somewhere between the atomic and 
compound data types.  It behaves like a structure, one component of 
which has special behavior.  Given that the special behavior is tied 
to the other parts of the structure, the compound result is treated 
as a predefined construct.

The &#x3C;typeRef&#x3E; element refers to an existing data type by its name.

<array> Element to Define Arrays </h3>

<p>
The &#x3c;array&#x3e; element can be used to create a new compound data type 
as an array of a compound or an atomic data type. Depending upon context,
this document, and others, refer to such arrays as tables or arrays
interchangeably, without semantic or syntactic implication.  The type of the 
array entry can be specified either by referring to an existing type 
(using the &#x3c;typeRef&#x3e; element) or defining an unnamed type inside the 
&#x3c;array&#x3e; element using any of the &#x3c;atomic&#x3e;,
&#x3c;array&#x3e;, &#x3c;struct&#x3e;, or &#x3c;union&#x3e; elements. 

</p>
<p>
The array can be "fixed-size" or "variable-size", which is specified 
by the "type" attribute of the &#x3c;array&#x3e; element. The default is 
"variable-size".  For variable size arrays, an optional "max-length" 
attribute specifies the maximum allowed length. This attribute 
should be used to encode semantic limitations, not implementation 
limitations. The latter should be handled by capability attributes 
of LFB classes, and should never be included in data type 
array is regarded as of unlimited-size. 

</p>
<p>
For fixed-size arrays, a "length" attribute MUST be provided that 
specifies the constant size of the array.

</p>
<p>       
The result of this construct MUST always be a compound type, even if 
the array has a fixed size of 1. 

</p>
<p>
Arrays MUST only be subscripted by integers, and will be presumed to 
start with index 0. 

</p>
<p>
In addition to their subscripts, arrays may be declared to have 
content keys.  Such a declaration has several effects: 

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
Any declared key can be used in the ForCES protocol to select 
a component for operations (for details, see the protocol). 

</li>
<li>
In any instance of the array, each declared key must be unique 
within that instance.  No two components of an array may have the 
same values on all the fields which make up a key. 

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Each key is declared with a keyID for use in the protocol, where the 
unique key is formed by combining one or more specified key fields.  
To support the case where an array of an atomic type with unique 
values can be referenced by those values, the key field identifier 
may be "*" (i.e., the array entry is the key).  If the value type of 
the array is a structure or an array, then the key is one or more 
components of the value type, each identified by name. 
Since the field may be a component 
of the contained structure, a component of a component of a structure, or 
further nested, the field name is actually a concatenated sequence 
of component identifiers, separated by decimal points (".").  The syntax 
for key field identification is given following the array examples. 

</p>

The following example shows the definition of a fixed size array 
with a pre-defined data type as the array content type: 

</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
  &lt;dataTypeDef&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;dscp-mapping-table&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;synopsis&gt;
           A table of 64 DSCP values, used to re-map code space.
        &lt;/synopsis&gt;
        &lt;array type="fixed-size" length="64"&gt;
           &lt;typeRef&gt;dscp&lt;/typeRef&gt;
        &lt;/array&gt;
      &lt;/dataTypeDef&gt;

The following example defines a variable size array with an upper
limit on its size:

      &lt;dataTypeDef&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;mac-alias-table&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;synopsis&gt;A table with up to 8 IEEE MAC addresses&lt;/synopsis&gt;
        &lt;array type="variable-size" max-length="8"&gt;
            &lt;typeRef&gt;ieeemacaddr&lt;/typeRef&gt;
        &lt;/array&gt;
      &lt;/dataTypeDef&gt;

The following example shows the definition of an array with a local
(unnamed) content type definition:

      &lt;dataTypeDef&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;classification-table&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;synopsis&gt;
          A table of classification rules and result opcodes.
        &lt;/synopsis&gt;
        &lt;array type="variable-size"&gt;
          &lt;struct&gt;
            &lt;component componentID="1"&gt;
              &lt;name&gt;rule&lt;/name&gt;
              &lt;synopsis&gt;The rule to match&lt;/synopsis&gt;
              &lt;typeRef&gt;classrule&lt;/typeRef&gt;
            &lt;/component&gt;
            &lt;component componentID="2"&gt;
              &lt;name&gt;opcode&lt;/name&gt;
              &lt;synopsis&gt;The result code&lt;/synopsis&gt;
              &lt;typeRef&gt;opcode&lt;/typeRef&gt;
            &lt;/component&gt;
         &lt;/struct&gt;
        &lt;/array&gt;
      &lt;/dataTypeDef&gt;

In the above example, each entry of the array is a &lt;struct&gt; of two
components ("rule" and "opcode").

The following example shows a table of IP Prefix information that 
can be accessed by a multi-field content key on the IP Address and 
prefix length.  This means that in any instance of this table, no 
two entries can have the same IP address and prefix length.

        &lt;/array&gt;
      &lt;/dataTypeDef&gt;

Note that the keyField elements could also have been simply address-
prefix and source, since all of the fields of address-prefix are 
being used.

Key Field References </h3>

<p>
In order to use key declarations, one must refer to components that are 
potentially nested inside other components in the array.  If there are 
nested arrays, one might even use an array element as a key (but 
great care would be needed to ensure uniqueness.) 

</p>
<p>
The key is the combination of the values of each field declared in a 
keyField element. 

</p>
<p>
Therefore, the value of a keyField element MUST be a concatenated 
Sequence of field identifiers, separated by a "." (period) 
character.  Whitespace is permitted and ignored. 

</p>
<p>
A valid string for a single field identifier within a keyField 
depends upon the current context.  Initially, in an array key 
declaration, the context is the type of the array.  Progressively, 
the context is whatever type is selected by the field identifiers 
processed so far in the current key field declaration. 

</p>
<p>
When the current context is an array, (e.g., when declaring a key 
for an array whose content is an array) then the only valid value 
for the field identifier is an explicit number. 

</p>
<p>
When the current context is a structure, the valid values for the 
field identifiers are the names of the components of the structure.  
In the special case of declaring a key for an array containing an 
atomic type, where that content is unique and is to be used as a 
key, the value "*" can be used as the single key field identifier.

<struct> Element to Define Structures</h3>

<p>
A structure is comprised of a collection of data components.  Each 
data components has a data type (either an atomic type or an existing 
compound type) and is assigned a name unique within the scope of the 
compound data type being defined.  These serve the same function as 
"struct" in C, etc.   

</p>
<p>
The actual type of the component can be defined by referring to an 
existing type (using the &#x3c;typeDef&#x3e; element), or can be a locally 
defined (unnamed) type created by any of the &#x3c;atomic&#x3e;,
&#x3c;array&#x3e;, &#x3c;struct&#x3e;, or &#x3c;union&#x3e; elements.  

</p>
<p>						
A structure definition is a series of component declarations.  Each 
component carries a componentID for use by the ForCES protocol. In 
addition, the component declaration contains the name of the component, 
a synopsis, an optional 
description, an optional declaration that the component itself is 
optional, and the typeRef declaration that specifies the component 
type. 

</p>
<p>
For a dataTypeDef of a struct, the structure definition may be 
inherited from, and augment, a previously defined structured type.  
This is indicated by including the derivedFrom attribute on the 
struct declaration. 

</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
The result of this construct MUST be a compound type, even when the
&lt;struct&gt; contains only one field.

An example:

&lt;dataTypeDef&gt;
 &lt;name&gt;ipv4prefix&lt;/name&gt;
 &lt;synopsis&gt;
  IPv4 prefix defined by an address and a prefix length
 &lt;/synopsis&gt;
 &lt;struct&gt;
  &lt;component componentID="1"&gt;
   &lt;name&gt;address&lt;/name&gt;
   &lt;synopsis&gt;Address part&lt;/synopsis&gt;
   &lt;typeRef&gt;ipv4addr&lt;/typeRef&gt;
  &lt;/component&gt;
  &lt;component componentID="2"&gt;
   &lt;name&gt;prefixlen&lt;/name&gt;
   &lt;synopsis&gt;Prefix length part&lt;/synopsis&gt;
   &lt;atomic&gt;
    &lt;baseType&gt;uchar&lt;/baseType&gt;
    &lt;rangeRestriction&gt;
     &lt;allowedRange min="0" max="32"/&gt;

<union> Element to Define Union Types </h3>

<p>
Similar to the union declaration in C, this construct allows the 
definition of overlay types.  Its format is identical to the 
&#x3c;struct&#x3e; element. 

</p>
<p> 
The result of this construct MUST be a compound type, even when the 
union contains only one element.

<alias> Element </h3>

<p>
It is sometimes necessary to have a component in an LFB or structure 
refer to information (a component) in other LFBs.  
The &#x3c;alias&#x3e; declaration 
creates the constructs for this. The content of an &#x3c;alias&#x3e; 
element MUST be a named type.  Whatever component the alias references
(whcih is determined by the alias component properties, as described below)
that component must be of the same type as that declared for the alias.  Thus,
when the CE or FE dereferences the alias component, the type of the
information returned is known.  The type can be a base type or a derived type.
The actual value referenced by an alias is known as its target.  When a 
GET or SET operation references the alias element, the value of the target 
is returned or replaced.  Write access to an alias element is 
permitted if write access to both the alias and the target are 
permitted. 

</p>
<p>
The target of a component declared by an &#x3e;alias&#x3e; element is
determined by it the components properties.  
Like all components, the properties MUST include the support / read / 
write permission for the alias.  In addition, there are several 
fields (components) in the alias properties which define the
target of the alias.  
These components are the ID of the LFB class of the target, the ID of 
the LFB instance of the target, and a sequence of integers 
representing the path within the target LFB instance to the target 
component.  The type of the target element must match the declared 
type of the alias.  Details of the alias property structure are described
in the section of this document on properties. 

</p>
<p>
Note that the read / write property of the alias refers to the 
value.  The CE can only determine if it can write the target 
selection properties of the alias by attempting such a write 
operation.  (Property components do not themselves have properties.)

<a name="rfc.section.4.5.7"></a><h3>4.5.7.&nbsp;
Augmentationst </h3>

<p>
Compound types can also be defined as augmentations of existing 
compound types.  If the existing compound type is a structure, 
augmentation may add new elements to the type.  The type of an 
existing component can be replaced in the definition of an augmenting
structure, but only with an augmentation derived 
from the current type of the existing component.
An existing component cannot be deleted.  If 
the existing compound type is an array, augmentation means 
augmentation of the array element type. 

</p>
<p>
One consequence of this is that augmentations are backwards compatible with 
the compound type from which they are derived.  As such, 
augmentations are useful in defining components for LFB subclasses 
with backward compatibility.  In addition to adding new components 
to a class, the data type of an existing components may be replaced 
by an augmentation of that component, and still meet the 
compatibility rules for subclasses.   

</p>
<p>
For example, consider a simple base LFB class A that has only one 
component (comp1) of type X.  One way to derive class A1 from A can 
be by simply adding a second component (of any type).  Another way 
to derive a class A2 from A can be by replacing the original 
component (comp1) in A of type X with one of type Y, where Y is an 
augmentation of X.  Both classes A1 and A2 are backward compatible 
with class A. 

</p>
<p>
The syntax for augmentations is to include a &#x3c;derivedFrom&#x3e; element in 
a structure definition, indicating what structure type is being 
augmented.  Component names and component IDs within the augmentation 
must not be the same as those in the structure type being augmented.

 <metadataDefs> Element for Metadata Definitions</h3>

<p>
The (optional) &#x3c;metadataDefs&#x3e; element in the library document 
contains one or more &#x3c;metadataDef&#x3e; elements.  
Each &#x3c;metadataDef&#x3e; element defines a metadata. 

</p>
<p>				
Each &#x3c;metadataDef&#x3e; element MUST contain a unique name (NMTOKEN). 
Uniqueness is defined to be over all metadata defined in this 
library document and in all directly or indirectly included library 
documents. The &#x3c;metadataDef&#x3e; element MUST also contain a brief 
synopsis, the mandatory tag value to be used for this metadata, an 
optional detailed description, and a mandatory type definition 
information. Only atomic data types can be used as value types for 
metadata.  

</p>
<p>						
Two forms of type definitions are allowed. The first form uses the 
&#x3c;typeRef&#x3e; element to refer to an existing atomic data type defined 
in the &#x3c;dataTypeDefs&#x3e; element of the same library document or 
in one of the included library documents. The usage of the 
&#x3c;typeRef&#x3e; element is identical to how it is used in the 
&#x3c;dataTypeDef&#x3e; elements, except here it can only refer to 
atomic types. 
The latter restriction is not yet enforced by the XML schema. 

</p>
<p>			
The second form is an explicit type definition using the &#x3c;atomic&#x3e; 
element. This element is used here in the same way as in the 
&#x3c;dataTypeDef&#x3e; elements.

</p>
<p>.										
The following example shows both usages: 

</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
&lt;metadataDefs&gt;
 &lt;metadataDef&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;NEXTHOPID&lt;/name&gt;

<LFBClassDefs> Element for LFB Class Definitions </h3>

<p>
The (optional) &#x3c;LFBClassDefs&#x3e; element can be used to define 
one or more LFB classes using &#x3c;LFBClassDef&#x3e; elements.  
Each &#x3c;LFBClassDef&#x3e; element MUST define an LFB class and 
include the following elements: 

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
&#x3c;name&#x3e; provides the symbolic name of the LFB class.  Example: 
"ipv4lpm" 

</li>
<li>
&#x3c;synopsis&#x3e; provides a short synopsis of the LFB class. Example: 
"IPv4 Longest Prefix Match Lookup LFB" 

</li>
<li>
&#x3c;version&#x3e; is the version indicator 

</li>
<li>
&#x3c;derivedFrom&#x3e; is the inheritance indicator 

</li>
<li>
&#x3c;inputPorts&#x3e; lists the input ports and their specifications 

</li>
<li>
&#x3c;outputPorts&#x3e; lists the output ports and their specifications 

</li>
<li>
&#x3c;components&#x3e; defines the operational components of the LFB 

</li>
<li>
&#x3c;capabilities&#x3e; defines the capability components of the LFB 

</li>
<li>
&#x3c;description&#x3e; contains the operational specification of the LFB 

</li>
<li>
The LFBClassID attribute of the LFBClassDef element defines the 
ID for this class.  These must be globally unique. 

</li>
<li>
&#x3c;events&#x3e; defines the events that can be generated by instances 
of this LFB. 

</li>
</ul>
<p>
LFB Class Names must be unique, in order to enable other documents 
to reference the classes by name, and to enable human readers to 
understand references to class names.  While a complex naming 
structure could be created, simplicity is preferred.  As given in the 
IANA considerations section of this document, the IANA will maintain 
a registry of LFB Class names and Class identifiers, along with a 
reference to the document defining the class.   

</p>
<p>
Here is a skeleton of an example LFB class definition: 

</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
&lt;LFBClassDefs&gt;
 &lt;LFBClassDef LFBClassID="12345"&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;ipv4lpm&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;synopsis&gt;IPv4 Longest Prefix Match Lookup LFB&lt;/synopsis&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;1.0&lt;/version&gt;
  &lt;derivedFrom&gt;baseclass&lt;/derivedFrom&gt;

  &lt;inputPorts&gt;
   ...
  &lt;/inputPorts&gt;

  &lt;outputPorts&gt;
   ...
  &lt;/outputPorts&gt;

  &lt;components&gt;
   ...
  &lt;/components&gt;

  &lt;capabilities&gt;
   ...
  &lt;/capabilities&gt;

  &lt;description&gt;
   This LFB represents the IPv4 longest prefix match lookup
   operation.
   The modeled behavior is as follows:
   Blah-blah-blah.
  &lt;/description&gt;

 &lt;/LFBClassDef&gt;
 ...
&lt;/LFBClassDefs&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>
The individual components and capabilities will have componentIDs for 
use by the ForCES protocol.  These parallel the componentIDs used in 
structs, and are used the same way.  Component and capability 
componentIDs must be unique within the LFB class definition. 

</p>
<p>
Note that the &#x3c;name&#x3e;, &#x3c;synopsis&#x3e;, and &#x3c;
version&#x3e; elements are required, all other elements are optional 
in &#x3c;LFBClassDef&#x3c;. However, when they are present, they must 
occur in the above order.

<inputPorts> Element to Define LFB Inputs</h3>

<p>
The optional &#x3c;inputPorts&#x3e; element is used to define input ports.  
An LFB class may have zero, one, or more inputs.  If the LFB class has 
no input ports, the &#x3c;inputPorts&#x3e; element MUST be omitted.  The 
&#x3c;inputPorts&#x3e; element can contain one or more &#x3c;inputPort
&#x3e; elements, one for each port or port-group.  We assume that most 
LFBs will have exactly one input.  Multiple inputs with the same input 
type are modeled as one input group.  Input groups are defined the same 
way as input ports by the &#x3c;inputPort&#x3e; element, differentiated 
only by an optional "group" attribute. 

</p>
<p>						
Multiple inputs with different input types should be avoided if 
possible (see discussion in <a class='info' href='#Section473'>Section&nbsp;4.7.3<span> (</span><span class='info'><outputPorts> Element to Define LFB Outputs</span><span>)</span></a>).  Some 
special LFBs will have no inputs at all.  For example, a packet 
generator LFB does not need an input. 

</p>
<p>
Single input ports and input port groups are both defined by the 
&#x3c;inputPort&#x3e; element; they are differentiated by only an 
optional "group" attribute. 

</p>
<p>
The &#x3c;inputPort&#x3e; element MUST contain the following elements: 

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
&#x3c;name&#x3e; provides the symbolic name of the input.  Example: "in".  
Note that this symbolic name must be unique only within the scope 
of the LFB class. 

</li>
<li>
&#x3c;synopsis&#x3e; contains a brief description of the input.  Example: 
"Normal packet input". 

</li>
<li>
&#x3c;expectation&#x3e; lists all allowed frame formats.  Example: 
{"ipv4" and "ipv6"}.  Note that this list should refer to names 
specified in the &#x3c;frameDefs&#x3e; element of the same library 
document or in any included library documents.  The &#x3c;
expectation&#x3e; element can also provide a list of required metadata.  
Example: {"classid", "vifid"}.  This list should refer to names of 
metadata defined in the &#x3c;metadataDefs&#x3e; element in the same 
library document or in any included library documents.  For each 
metadata, it must be specified whether the metadata is required or 
optional.  For each optional metadata, a default value must be 
specified, which is used by the LFB if the metadata is not provided 
with a packet. 

</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition, the optional "group" attribute of the &#x3c;inputPort&#x3e; 
element can specify if the port can behave as a port group, i.e., it 
is allowed to be instantiated.  This is indicated by a "yes" value 
(the default value is "no"). 

</p>
<p>
An example &#x3c;inputPorts&#x3c; element, defining two input ports, the 
second one being an input port group: 

</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
&lt;inputPorts&gt;
 &lt;inputPort&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;in&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;synopsis&gt;Normal input&lt;/synopsis&gt;
  &lt;expectation&gt;
   &lt;frameExpected&gt;
    &lt;ref&gt;ipv4&lt;/ref&gt;
    &lt;ref&gt;ipv6&lt;/ref&gt;
   &lt;/frameExpected&gt;
   &lt;metadataExpected&gt;
    &lt;ref&gt;classid&lt;/ref&gt;
    &lt;ref&gt;vifid&lt;/ref&gt;
    &lt;ref dependency="optional" defaultValue="0"&gt;vrfid&lt;/ref&gt;
   &lt;/metadataExpected&gt;
  &lt;/expectation&gt;
 &lt;/inputPort&gt;
 &lt;inputPort group="yes"&gt;
  ... another input port ...
 &lt;/inputPort&gt;
&lt;/inputPorts&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>
For each &#x3c;inputPort&#x3e;, the frame type expectations are defined 
by the &#x3c;frameExpected&#x3e; element using one or more &#x3c;ref&#x3e; 
elements (see example above).  When multiple frame types are listed, 
it means that "one of these" frame types is expected.  A packet of any 
other frame type is regarded as incompatible with this input port of the LFB 
class.  The above example list two frames as expected frame types: 
"ipv4" and "ipv6". 

</p>
<p>
Metadata expectations are specified by the &#x3c;metadataExpected&#x3e; 
element.  In its simplest form, this element can contain a list of 
&#x3c;ref&#x3e; elements, each referring to a metadata.  When multiple 
instances of metadata are listed by &#x3c;ref&#x3e; elements, it means 
that "all of these" metadata must be received with each packet (except 
metadata that are marked as "optional" by the "dependency" attribute 
ot the corresponding &#x3c;ref&#x3e; element).  For a metadata that is 
specified "optional", a default value MUST be provided using the 
"defaultValue" attribute.  The above example lists three metadata as 
expected metadata, two of which are mandatory ("classid" and 
"vifid"), and one being optional ("vrfid"). 

</p>
<p>
The schema also allows for more complex definitions of metadata 
expectations.  For example, using the &#x3c;one-of&#x3e; element, a list of 
metadata can be specified to express that at least one of the 
specified metadata must be present with any packet. For example: 

</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
&lt;metadataExpected&gt;
 &lt;one-of&gt;
  &lt;ref&gt;prefixmask&lt;/ref&gt;
  &lt;ref&gt;prefixlen&lt;/ref&gt;
 &lt;/one-of&gt;
&lt;/metadataExpected&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>
The above example specifies that either the "prefixmask" or the 
"prefixlen" metadata must be provided with any packet. 

</p>
<p>
The two forms can also be combined, as it is shown in the following 
example: 

</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
&lt;metadataExpected&gt;
 &lt;ref&gt;classid&lt;/ref&gt;
 &lt;ref&gt;vifid&lt;/ref&gt;
 &lt;ref dependency="optional" defaultValue="0"&gt;vrfid&lt;/ref&gt;
 &lt;one-of&gt;
  &lt;ref&gt;prefixmask&lt;/ref&gt;
  &lt;ref&gt;prefixlen&lt;/ref&gt;
 &lt;/one-of&gt;
&lt;/metadataExpected&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>
Although the schema is constructed to allow even more complex 
definitions of metadata expectations, we do not discuss those here.

<outputPorts> Element to Define LFB Outputs</h3>

<p>		
The optional &#x3c;outputPorts&#x3e; element is used to define output ports.  
An LFB class may have zero, one, or more outputs.  If the LFB class 
has no output ports, the &#x3c;outputPorts&#x3e; element MUST be omitted.  The 
&#x3c;outputPorts&#x3e; element can contain one or more &#x3c;
outputPort&#x3e; elements, one for each port or port-group.  If there 
are multiple outputs with the same output type, we model them as an 
output port group.  Some special LFBs may have no outputs at 
all (e.g., Dropper). 

</p>
<p>
Single output ports and output port groups are both defined by the 
&#x3c;outputPort&#x3e; element; they are differentiated by only an optional 
"group" attribute. 

</p>
<p>
The &#x3c;outputPort&#x3e; element MUST contain the following elements: 

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
&#x3c;name&#x3e; provides the symbolic name of the output.  Example: "out". 
Note that the symbolic name must be unique only within the scope 
of the LFB class. 

</li>
<li>
&#x3c;synopsis&#x3e; contains a brief description of the output port. 
Example: "Normal packet output".

</li>
<li>
&#x3c;product&#x3e; lists the allowed frame formats.  Example: {"ipv4", 
"ipv6"}.  Note that this list should refer to symbols specified in 
the &#x3c;frameDefs&#x3e; element in the same library document or in any 
included library documents.  The &#x3c;product&#x3e; element may also 
contain the list of emitted (generated) metadata.  Example: 
{"classid", "color"}.  This list should refer to names of metadata 
specified in the &#x3c;metadataDefs&#x3e; element in the same library 
document or in any included library documents.  For each generated 
metadata, it should be specified whether the metadata is always 
generated or generated only in certain conditions. This 
information is important when assessing compatibility between 
LFBs. 

</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition, the optional "group" attribute of the &#x3c;outputPort&#x3e; 
element can specify if the port can behave as a port group, i.e., it 
is allowed to be instantiated. This is indicated by a "yes" value 
(the default value is "no"). 

</p>
<p>
The following example specifies two output ports, the second being 
an output port group: 

</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
&lt;outputPorts&gt;
 &lt;outputPort&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;out&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;synopsis&gt;Normal output&lt;/synopsis&gt;
  &lt;product&gt;
   &lt;frameProduced&gt;
    &lt;ref&gt;ipv4&lt;/ref&gt;
    &lt;ref&gt;ipv4bis&lt;/ref&gt;
   &lt;/frameProduced&gt;
   &lt;metadataProduced&gt;
    &lt;ref&gt;nhid&lt;/ref&gt;
    &lt;ref&gt;nhtabid&lt;/ref&gt;
   &lt;/metadataProduced&gt;
  &lt;/product&gt;
 &lt;/outputPort&gt;
 &lt;outputPort group="yes"&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;exc&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;synopsis&gt;Exception output port group&lt;/synopsis&gt;
  &lt;product&gt;
   &lt;frameProduced&gt;
    &lt;ref&gt;ipv4&lt;/ref&gt;
    &lt;ref&gt;ipv4bis&lt;/ref&gt;
   &lt;/frameProduced&gt;
   &lt;metadataProduced&gt;
    &lt;ref availability="conditional"&gt;errorid&lt;/ref&gt;
   &lt;/metadataProduced&gt;
  &lt;/product&gt;
 &lt;/outputPort&gt;
&lt;/outputPorts&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>
The types of frames and metadata the port produces are defined 
inside the &#x3c;product&#x3e; element in each &#x3c;outputPort&#x3e;.  
Within the &#x3c;product&#x3e; element, the list of frame types the port 
produces is listed in the &#x3c;frameProduced&#x3e; element.  
When more than one frame is listed, it means that "one of" these frames 
will be produced. 

</p>
<p>
The list of metadata that is produced with each packet is listed in 
the optional &#x3c;metadataProduced&#x3e; element of the &#x3c;product&#x3e;.  
In its simplest form, this element can contain a list of &#x3c;ref&#x3e; 
elements, each referring to a metadata type.  The meaning of such a list is 
that "all of" these metadata are provided with each packet, except 
those that are listed with the optional "availability" attribute set 
to "conditional".  Similar to the &#x3c;metadataExpected&#x3e; element of the 
&#x3c;inputPort&#x3e;, the &#x3c;metadataProduced&#x3e; element supports 
more complex forms, which we do not discuss here further.

 <components> Element to Define LFB Operational Components</h3>

<p>
Operational parameters of the LFBs that must be visible to the CEs 
are conceptualized in the model as the LFB components.  These 
include, for example, flags, single parameter arguments, complex 
arguments, and tables.  Note that the components here refer to only 
those operational parameters of the LFBs that must be visible to the 
CEs.  Other variables that are internal to LFB implementation are 
not regarded as LFB components and hence are not covered. 

</p>
<p>
Some examples for LFB components are: 

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
Configurable flags and switches selecting between operational 
modes of the LFB 

</li>
<li>
Number of inputs or outputs in a port group 

</li>
<li>
Metadata CONSUME vs.PROPAGATE mode selector 

</li>
<li>
Various configurable lookup tables, including interface tables, 
prefix tables, classification tables, DSCP mapping tables, MAC 
address tables, etc. 

</li>
<li>
Packet and byte counters 

</li>
<li>
Various event counters 

</li>
<li>
Number of current inputs or outputs for each input or output 
group 

</li>
</ul>
<p>
There may be various access permission restrictions on what the CE 
can do with an LFB component.  The following categories may be 
supported: 

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
No-access components.  This is useful when multiple access 
modes may be defined for a given component to allow some 
flexibility for different implementations. 

</li>
<li>
Read-only components. 

</li>
<li>
Read-write components. 

</li>
<li>
Write-only components.  This could be any configurable data for 
which read capability is not provided to the CEs.  (e.g., the 
security key information) 

</li>
<li>
Read-reset components.  The CE can read and reset this 
resource, but cannot set it to an arbitrary value.  Example: 
Counters. 

</li>
<li>
Firing-only components.  A write attempt to this resource will 
trigger some specific actions in the LFB, but the actual value 
written is ignored.   

</li>
</ul>
<p>
The LFB class may define more than one possible access mode for a 
given component (for example, "write-only" and "read-write"), in 
which case it is left to the actual implementation to pick one of 
the modes.  In such cases, a corresponding property component must 
inform the CE about the access mode the actual LFB instance supports. 

</p>
<p>
The components of the LFB class are listed in the &#x3c;components&#x3e; 
element.  Each component is defined by an &#x3c;component&#x3e; element.  An 
&#x3c;component&#x3e; element MUST contain the following elements: 

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
&#x3c;name&#x3e; defines the name of the component.This name must be 
unique among the components of the LFB class.  Example: 
"version".  

</li>
<li>
&#x3c;synopsis&#x3e; should provide a brief description of the purpose of 
the component. 

</li>
<li>
&#x3c;optional/&#x3e; indicates that this component is optional. 

</li>
<li>
The data type of the component can be defined either via a 
reference to a predefined data type or providing a local 
definition of the type.  The former is provided by using the 
&#x3c;typeRef&#x3e; element, which must refer to the unique name of an 
existing data type defined in the &#x3c;dataTypeDefs&#x3e; element in the 
same library document or in any of the included library 
documents.  When the data type is defined locally (unnamed 
type), one of the following elements can be used: &#x3c;atomic&#x3e;, 
&#x3c;array&#x3e;, &#x3c;struct&#x3e;, and &#x3c;union&#x3e;. Their usage 
is identical to how they are used inside &#x3c;dataTypeDef&#x3e; elements 
(see <a class='info' href='#Section45'>Section&nbsp;4.5<span> (</span><span class='info'><dataTypeDefs> Element for Data Type Definitions</span><span>)</span></a>). 

</li>
<li>
The optional &#x3c;defaultValue&#x3e; element can specify a default value 
for the component, which is applied when the LFB is initialized 
or reset.   

</li>
</ul>
<p>
The &#x3c;component&#x3e; element also MUST have an componentID attribute,
 which is a numeric value used by the ForCES protocol. 

</p>
<p>
In addition to the above elements, the &#x3c;component&#x3e; element 
includes an optional "access" attribute, which can take any of the 
following values or even a list of these values: "read-only", "read-write", 
"write-only", "read-reset", and "trigger-only". The default access 
mode is "read-write". 

</p>
<p>
Whether optional components are supported, and whether components 
defined as read-write can actually be written can be determined for 
a given LFB instance by the CE by reading the property information 
of that component. 

</p>
<p>
The following example defines two attributes for an LFB: 

</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
&lt;components&gt;
 &lt;component access="read-only" componentID=1&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;foo&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;synopsis&gt;number of things&lt;/synopsis&gt;
  &lt;typeRef&gt;uint32&lt;/typeRef&gt;
 &lt;/component&gt;
 &lt;component access="read-write write-only" componentID=2&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;bar&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;synopsis&gt;number of this other thing&lt;/synopsis&gt;
  &lt;atomic&gt;
   &lt;baseType&gt;uint32&lt;/baseType&gt;
   &lt;rangeRestriction&gt;
    &lt;allowedRange min="10" max="2000"/&gt;
   &lt;/rangeRestriction&gt;
  &lt;/atomic&gt;
  &lt;defaultValue&gt;10&lt;/defaultValue&gt;
 &lt;/component&gt;
&lt;/component&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>
The first component ("foo") is a read-only 32-bit unsigned integer, 
defined by referring to the built-in "uint32" atomic type.  The 
second component ("bar") is also an integer, but uses the &#x3c;atomic&#x3e; 
element to provide additional range restrictions. This attribute has 
two possible access modes, "read-write" or "write-only".  A default 
value of 10 is provided. 

</p>
<p>
Note that not all components are likely to exist at all times in a 
particular implementation.  While the capabilities will frequently 
indicate this non-existence, CEs may attempt to reference non-
existent or non-permitted attributes anyway.  The FORCES protocol 
mechanisms should include appropriate error indicators for this 
case. 

</p>
<p>
The mechanism defined above for non-supported component can also 
apply to attempts to reference non-existent array elements or to set 
read-only components.

<capabilities> Element to Define LFB Capability Components</h3>

<p>		
The LFB class specification provides some flexibility for the FE 
implementation regarding how the LFB class is implemented.  For 
example, the instance may have some limitations that are not 
inherent from the class definition, but rather the result of some 
implementation limitations.  Some of these limitations are captured by
the property information of the LFB components.  The model allows for 
the notion of additional capability information.

</p>
<p>
Such capability related information is expressed by the capability 
components of the LFB class.  The capability components are always 
read-only attributes, and they are listed in a separate 
&#x3c;capabilities&#x3e; element in the &#x3c;LFBClassDef&#x3e;.  
The &#x3c;capabilities&#x3e; 
element contains one or more &#X3C;capability&#x3e; elements, each 
defining one capability component.  The format of the 
&#X3C;capability&#X3E; element is almost the same as the 
&#X3C;component&#X3E; element, it differs in two 
aspects: it lacks the access mode attribute (because it is always 
read-only), and it lacks the &#X3C;defaultValue&#X3E; element 
(because default value is not applicable to read-only attributes).  

</p>
<p>
Some examples of capability components follow: 

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
The version of the LFB class that this LFB instance complies 
with; 

</li>
<li>
Supported optional features of the LFB class; 

</li>
<li>
Maximum number of configurable outputs for an output group; 

</li>
<li>
Metadata pass-through limitations of the LFB; 

</li>
<li>
Additional range restriction on operational components; 

</li>
</ul>
<p>
The following example lists two capability attributes: 

</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
&lt;capabilities&gt;
 &lt;capability componentID="3"&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;version&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;synopsis&gt;
   LFB class version this instance is compliant with.
  &lt;/synopsis&gt;
  &lt;typeRef&gt;version&lt;/typeRef&gt;
 &lt;/capability&gt;
 &lt;capability componentID="4"&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;limitBar&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;synopsis&gt;
   Maximum value of the "bar" attribute.
  &lt;/synopsis&gt;
  &lt;typeRef&gt;uint16&lt;/typeRef&gt;
 &lt;/capability&gt;
&lt;/capabilities&gt;

<events> Element for LFB Notification Generation </h3>

<p>
The &#x3C;events&#x3e; element contains the information about the occurrences 
for which instances of this LFB class can generate notifications to 
the CE. 

</p>
<p>
The &#x3C;events&#x3e; element has a baseID attribute value, which is 
normally &#x3C;events baseID="number"&#x3e;.  The value of the baseID is the 
starting componentID for the path which identifies events.  It must not 
be the same as the componentID of any top level components (including 
capabilities) of the LFB class.  In derived LFBs (i.e. ones with a 
&#x3C;derivedFrom&#x3e; element) where the parent LFB class has an events 
declaration, the baseID must not be present in the derived LFB 
&#x3c;events&#x3e; element.  Instead, the baseID value 
from the parent LFB class is used. 

</p>
<p>
The &#x3C;events&#x3e; element contains 0 or more &#x3C;event&#x3e; 
elements, each of which declares a single event.  The &#x3C;event&#x3e; 
element has an eventID attribute giving the unique ID of the event.  
The element will include: 

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
&#x3c;eventTarget&#x3e; element indicating which LFB field (component) is 
tested to generate the event; 

</li>
<li>
&#x3c;condition&#x3e; element indicating what condition on the field will 
generate the event from a list of defined conditions; 

</li>
<li>
&#x3c;eventReports&#x3e; element indicating what values are to be 
reported in the notification of the event. 

</li>

<a name="rfc.section.4.7.6.1"></a><h3>4.7.6.1.&nbsp;
<eventTarget> Element</h3>

<p>
The &#x3c;eventTarget&#x3e; element contains information identifying 
a field in the LFB.  Specifically, the &#x3c;target&#x3e; element 
contains one or more &#x3c;eventField&#x3e; or &#x3c;eventSubscript&#x3e; 
elements.  These elements represent the textual equivalent of a path 
select component of the LFB. The &#x3c;eventField&#x3e; element contains 
the name of a component in the LFB or a component nested in an array or
struct within the LFB.  The first element in a 
&#x3c;target&#x3e; MUST be an &#x3c;eventField&#x3e; element and MUST 
name a componet in the LFB.  
The following element MUST identify a valid component within the containing 
context.  If an &#x3c;eventField&#x3e; identifies an array, and is not 
the last element in the target, then the next element MUST be an &#x3c;
eventSubscript&#x3e; element.  &#x3c;eventSubscript&#x3e; elements MUST occur 
only after &#x3c;eventField&#x3e; names that identifies an array component.  
An &#x3c;eventSubscript&#x3e; may contain a numeric value to indicate 
that this event applies to a specific entry (by index) of 
the array.  More commonly, the event is being defined across all 
elements of the array.  In that case, &#x3c;eventSubscript&#x3e; will 
contain a name.  The name in an &#x3c;eventSubscript&#x3e; element is 
not a component name.  It is a variable name for use in the
&#x3c;report&#x3e; elements of this LFB definition.  This name MUST be 
distinct from any component name that can validly occur in the
&#x3c;eventReport&#x3e; clause.  Hence it SHOULD be distinct from any
component name used in the LFB or in structures used within the LFB.   

</p>
<p>
The &#x3c;eventTarget&#x3e; provides additional components for the path 
used to reference the event.  The path will be the baseID for events, 
followed by the ID for the specific event, followed by a value for 
each &#x3c;eventSubscript&#x3e; element in the &#x3c;eventTarget&#x3e;.  
This will identify a specific occurrence of the event.  So, for 
example, it will appear in the event notification LFB.  It is also used 
for the SET-PROPERTY operation to subscribe to a specific event.  A 
SET-PROPERTY of the subscription property (but not of any other 
writeable properties) may be sent by the CE with any prefix of the 
path of the event.  So, for an event defined on a table, a SET-
PROPERTY with a path of the baseID and the eventID will subscribe 
the CE to all occurrences of that event on any entry of the table.  
This is particularly useful for the &#x3c;eventCreated/&#x3e; and 
&#x3c;eventDestroyed/&#x3e; conditions.  Events using those conditions will 
generally be defined with a field / subscript sequence that 
identifies an array and ends with an &#x3c;eventSubscript&#x3e; element.  
Thus, the event notification will indicate which array entry has 
been created or destroyed.  A typical subscriber will subscribe for 
the array, as opposed to a specific entry in an array, so it will 
use a shorter path. 

</p>
<p>
Thus, if there is an LFB with an event baseID of 7, and a specific 
event with an event ID of 8, then one can subscribe to the event by 
referencing the properties of the LFB component with path 7.8.  If the 
event target has no subscripts (for example, it is a simple 
component of the LFB) then one can also reference the event 
threshold and filtering properties via the properties on element 
7.8.  If the event target is defined as a entry in an array, then 
the target definition will include an &#x3c;eventSubscript&#x3e; element.  
In that case, one can subscribe to the event for the entire array by 
referencing the properties of 7.8.  One can also subscribe to a 
specific element, x, of the array by referencing the subscription 
property of 7.8.x and also access the threshold and filtering 
properties of 7.8.x.  If the event is targeting an entry in an 
array within an array, then there will be two (or conceivably more) 
&#x3c;eventSubscript&#x3e; elements in the target description. 
If so, for the 
case of two elements, one would reference the properties of 7.8.x.y 
to get to the threshold and filtering properties of an individual event. 

</p>
<p>       
Threshold and filtering conditions can only be applied to individual 
events.  For events defined on elements of an array, this 
specification does not allow for defining a threshold or filtering 
condition on an event for all elements of an array.

      As described in the Event Properties section, event items have 
      properties associated with them.  These properties include the 
      subscription information (indicating whether the CE wishes the FE to 
      generate event reports for the event at all, thresholds for events 
      related to level crossing, and filtering conditions that may reduce 
      the set of event notifications generated by the FE.  Details of the 
      filtering conditions that can be applied are given in that section. 
      The filtering conditions allow the FE to suppress floods of events 
      that could result from oscillation around a condition value.  For FEs 
      that do not wish to support filtering, the filter properties can 
      either be read only or not supported.

<eventReports> Element </h3>

<p>
The &#x3c;eventReports&#x3e; element of an &#x3c;event&#x3e; describes 
the information to be delivered by the FE along with the notification 
of the occurrence of the event.  The &#x3c;reports&#x3e; element 
contains one or more &#x3c;eventReport&#x3e; elements.  Each
&#x3c;report&#x3e; element identifies a piece of data from the LFB to be 
reported.  The notification carries that data as if the collection of 
&#x3c;eventReport&#x3e; elements had been defined in a structure.  
Each &#x3c;eventReport&#x3e; element thus MUST identify a component in the
LFB.  
The syntax is exactly the same as used in the &#x3c;eventTarget&#x3e; 
element, using &#x3c;eventField&#x3e; and &#x3c;eventSubscript&#x3e;
elements.  &#x3c;eventSubcripts&#x3e; may contain integers.  If they 
contain names, they MUST be names from &#x3c;eventSubscript&#x3e; 
elements of the &#x3c;eventTarget&#x3e;.  The selection for the report 
will use the value for the subscript that identifies that specific 
element triggering the event.  This can be used to reference the 
Component causing the event, or to reference related 
information in parallel tables.  
This event reporting structure is designed to allow the LFB designer 
to specify information that is likely not known a priori by the CE 
and is likely needed by the CE to process the event.  While the 
structure allows for pointing at large blocks of information (full 
arrays or complex structures) this is not recommended.  Also, the 
variable reference / subscripting in reporting only captures a small 
portion of the kinds of related information.  Chaining through index 
fields stored in a table, for example, is not supported.  In 
general, the &#x3c;eventReports&#x3e; mechanism is an optimization for cases 
that have been found to be common, saving the CE from having to 
query for information it needs to understand the event.  It does not 
represent all possible information needs. 

</p>
<p>      
If any components referenced by the eventReport are optional, then the 
report MUST support optional elements.  Any components which do not 
exist are not reported.

Properties</h3>

<p>
      Components of LFBs have properties which are important to the CE.  The 
      most important property is the existence / readability / 
      writeability of the element.  Depending up the type of the component, 
      other information may be of importance. 

</p>
<p>
      The model provides the definition of the structure of property 
      information.  There is a base class of property information.  For 
      the array, alias, and event components there are subclasses of 
      property information providing additional fields.  This information 
      is accessed by the CE (and updated where applicable) via the PL 
      protocol.  While some property information is writeable, there is no 
      mechanism currently provided for checking the properties of a 
      property element.  Writeability can only be checked by attempting to 
      modify the value.

Event Properties</h3>

<p>
      The properties for an event add three (usually) writeable fields.  
      One is the subscription field.  0 means no notification is 
      generated.  Any non-zero value (typically 1 is used) means that a 
      notification is generated.  The hysteresis field is used to suppress 
      generation of notifications for oscillations around a condition 
      value, and is described in the text for events.  The threshold field 
      is used for the &#x3c;eventGreaterThan/&#x3e; and
      &#x3c;eventLessThan/&#x3e; conditions.  
      It indicates the value to compare the event target against.  Using 
      the properties allows the CE to set the level of interest.  FEs 
      which do not supporting setting the threshold for events will make 
      this field read-only.

Common Event Filtering </h3>

<p>
      The event properties have values for controlling several filter 
      conditions.  Support of these conditions is optional, but all 
      conditions SHOULD be supported.  Events which are reliably known not 
      to be subject to rapid occurrence or other concerns may not support 
      all filter conditions. 

</p>
<p>
      Currently, three different filter condition variables are defined.  
      These are eventCount, eventInterval, and eventHysteresis.  Setting 
      the condition variables to 0 (their default value) means that the 
      condition is not checked.  

</p>
<p>
      Conceptually, when an event is triggered, all configured conditions 
      are checked.  If no filter conditions are triggered, or if any 
      trigger conditions are met, the event notification is generated.  If 
      there are filter conditions, and no condition is met, then no event 
      notification is generated.  Event filter conditions have reset 
      behavior when an event notification is generated.  If any condition 
      is passed, and the notification is generated, the notification reset 
      behavior is performed on all conditions, even those which had not 
      passed.  This provides a clean definition of the interaction of the 
      various event conditions.   

</p>
<p>
      An example of the interaction of conditions is an event with an 
      eventCount property set to 5 and an eventInterval property set to 
      500 milliseconds.  Suppose that a burst of occurrences of this event 
      is detected by the FE.  The first occurrence will cause a 
      notification to be sent to the CE.  Then, if four more occurrences 
      are detected rapidly (less than 0.5 seconds) they will not result in 
      notifications.  If two more occurrences are detected, then the 
      second of those will result in a notification.  Alternatively, if 
      more than 500 milliseconds has passed since the notification and an 
      occurrence is detected, that will result in a notification.  In 
      either case, the count and time interval suppression is reset no 
      matter which condition actually caused the notification.

 Event Hysteresis Filtering</h3>

<p>
      Events with numeric conditions can have hysteresis filters applied 
      to them.  The hysteresis level is defined by a property of the 
      event.  This allows the FE to notify the CE of the hysteresis 
      applied, and if it chooses, the FE can allow the CE to modify the 
      hysteresis.  This applies to &#x3c;eventChanged/&#x3e; for a 
      numeric field, and to &#x3c;eventGreaterThan/&#x3e; and &#x3c;
      eventLessThan/&#x3e;.  The content of a &#x3c;variance&#x3e; 
      element is a numeric value.  When supporting hysteresis, 
      the FE MUST track the value of the element and make sure that the 
      condition has become untrue by at least the hysteresis from the 
      event property.  To be specific, if the hysteresis is V, then 

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
     For a &#x3c;eventChanged/&#x3e; condition, if the last notification was 
     for value X, then the &#x3c;changed/&#x3e; notification MUST NOT be 
     generated until the value reaches X +/- V. 
     
</li>
<li>
     For a &#x3c;eventGreaterThan/&#x3e; condition with threshold T, once 
     the event has been generated at least once it MUST NOT be generated 
     again until the field first becomes less than or equal to T -
     -V, and then exceeds T. 
     
</li>
<li>
     For a &#x3c;eventLessThan/&#x3e; condition with threshold T, once the 
     event has been generate at least once it MUST NOT be generated 
     again until the field first becomes greater than or equal to T 
     + V, and then becomes less than T.

Event Count Filtering</h3>

<p>
      Events may have a count filtering condition.  This property, if set 
      to a non-zero value, indicates the number of occurrences of the event 
      that should be considered redundant and not result in a notification.  
      Thus, if this property is set to 1, and no other conditions apply, 
      then every other detected occurrence of the event will result in a 
      notification.  This particular meaning is chosen so that the value 1 
      has a distinct meaning from the value 0. 

</p>
<p>
      A conceptual implementation (not required) for this might be an 
      internal suppression counter.  Whenever an event is triggered, the 
      counter is checked.  If the counter is 0, a notification is 
      generated.  Whether a notification is generated or not, the counter 
      is incremented.  If the counter exceeds the configured value, it is 
      reset to 0.  In this conceptual implementation the reset behavior 
      when a notification is generated can be thought of as setting the 
      counter to 1.

Event Time Filtering</h3>

<p>
      Events may have a time filtering condition.  This property 
      represents the minimum time interval (in the absence of some other 
      filtering condition being passed) between generating notifications of 
      detected events.  This condition MUST only be passed if the time 
      since the last notification of the event is longer than the 
      configured interval in milliseconds. 

</p>
<p>
      Conceptually, this can be thought of as a stored timestamp which is 
      compared with the detection time, or as a timer that is running that 
      resets a suppression flag.  In either case, if a notification is 
      generated due to passing any condition then the time interval 
      detection MUST be restarted.

Alias Properties</h3>

<p>  
      The properties for an alias add three (usually) writeable fields.  
      These combine to identify the target component the subject alias

FE Components and Capabilities</h3>

<p>
      A ForCES forwarding element handles traffic on behalf of a ForCES 
      control element.  While the standards will describe the protocol and 
      mechanisms for this control, different implementations and different 
      instances will have different capabilities.  The CE MUST be able to 
      determine what each instance it is responsible for is actually 
      capable of doing.  As stated previously, this is an approximation.  
      The CE is expected to be prepared to cope with errors in requests 
      and variations in detail not captured by the capabilities 
      information about an FE. 
      
</p>
<p>
      In addition to its capabilities, an FE will have 
      information that can be used in understanding and controlling the 
      forwarding operations. Some of this information will be read only, 
      while others parts may also be writeable. 
      
</p>
<p>
      In order to make the FE information easily accessible, the 
      information is represented in an LFB.  This LFB has  a class, 
      FEObject.  The LFBClassID for this class is 1.  Only one instance of 
      this class will ever be present, and the instance ID of that 
      instance in the protocol is 1.  Thus, by referencing the components of 
      class:1, instance:1 a CE can get the general information about the FE.  
      The FEObject LFB Class is described in this section. 
      
</p>
<p>
      There will also be an FEProtocol LFB Class.  LFBClassID 2 is 
      reserved for that class.  There will be only one instance of that 
      class as well.  Details of that class are defined in the ForCES 
      protocol document.

 SupportedLFBs and SupportedLFBType</h3>

<p>
      One capability that the FE should include is the list of supported

      the information about each supported LFB Class.  The array structure 
      type is defined as the SupportedLFBType dataTypeDef. 
      
</p>
<p>
      Each entry in the SupportedLFBs array describes an LFB 
      class that the FE supports.  In addition to indicating that the FE 
      supports the class, FEs with modifiable LFB topology SHOULD include 
      information about how LFBs of the specified class may be connected 
      to other LFBs.  This information SHOULD describe which LFB classes 
      the specified LFB class may succeed or precede in the LFB topology.  
      The FE SHOULD include information as to which port groups may be 
      connected to the given adjacent LFB class.  If port group 
      information is omitted, it is assumed that all port groups may be 
      used.  This capability information on the acceptable ordering and
      connection of LFBs MAY
      be omitted if the implementor concludes that the actual constraints
      are such that the information would be misleading for the CE.

     The CanOccurAfters component is an array that contains the list of

     defined in the LFBAdjacencyLimitType dataTypeDef. 
     
</p>
<p>
     The array entries describe a permissible positioning of the 
     described LFB class, referred to here as the SupportedLFB.  
     Specifically, each array entry names an LFB that can topologically 
     precede that LFB class.  That is, the SupportedLFB can have an input 
     port connected to an output port of an LFB that appears in the 
     CanOccurAfters array.  The LFB class that the SupportedLFB can 
     follow is identified by the NeighborLFB component (of the 
     LFBAdjacencyLimitType dataTypeDef) of the CanOccurAfters array entry.
     If this neighbor can only be 
     connected to a specific set of input port groups, then the viaPort 
     component is included.  This component is an array, with one entry
     for each input port group of the SupportedLFB that can be
     connected to an output port of the NeighborLFB. 
     
</p>
<p>
     [e.g., Within a SupportedLFBs entry, each array entry of the 
     CanOccurAfters array must have a unique NeighborLFB, and within each

     port group of the SupportedLFB.  The LFB Class definition schema 
     does not yet support these uniqueness constraints.]

      parallels CanOccurAfters, and uses the same type definition for the 
      array entries.

<p>
      The array entries list those LFB classes that the SupportedLFB may

 LFBClassCapabilitiese</h3>

<p>
      While it would be desirable to include class capability level 
      information, this is not included in the model.  While such 
      information belongs in the FE Object in the supported class table, 
      the contents of that information would be class specific.  The 
      currently expected encoding structures for transferring information 
      between the CE and FE are such that allowing completely unspecified 
      information would be likely to induce parse errors.  We could 
      specify that the information is encoded in an octetstring, but then 
      we would have to define the internal format of that octet string. 
      
</p>
<p>
      As there also are not currently any defined LFB Class level 
      Capabilities that the FE needs to report, this information is not 
      present now, but may be added in a future version of the FE  
      Object.  (This is an example of a case where versioning, rather than 
      inheritance, would be needed, since the FE Object must have class ID 
      1 and instance ID 1 so that the protocol behavior can start by 
      finding this object.)

      of the array is defined by the FEConfiguredNeighborType dataTypeDef. 
      
</p>
<p>
      This array is intended to capture information that may be configured 
      on the FE and is needed by the CE, where one array entry corresponds 
      to each configured neighbor.  Note that this array is not intended 
      to represent the results of any discovery protocols, as those will 
      have their own LFBs.   
      
</p>
<p>
      While there may be many ways to configure neighbors, the FE-ID is 
      the best way for the CE to correlate entities.  And the interface 
      identifier (name string) is the best correlator.  The CE will be 
      able to determine the IP address and media level information about 
      the neighbor from the neighbor directly.  Omitting that information 
      from this table avoids the risk of incorrect double configuration.

Satisfying the Requirements on FE Model </h3>

<p>
      This section describes how the proposed FE model meets the 
      requirements outlined in <a class='info' href='#Section5'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>FE Components and Capabilities</span><span>)</span></a> of 
      <a class='info' href='#RFC3654'>[2]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Khosravi, H. and T. Anderson, &ldquo;Requirements for Separation of IP Control and Forwarding,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>.  The requirements can be separated into 
      general requirements (<a class='info' href='#Section5'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>FE Components and Capabilities</span><span>)</span></a>, 
      5.1 - 5.4) and the specification of the minimal set of logical 
      functions that the FE model must support (Section 5.5).
      
</p>
<p>
      The general requirement on the FE model is that it be able to 
      express the logical packet processing capability of the FE, through 
      both a capability and a state model.  In addition, the FE model is 
      expected to allow flexible implementations and be extensible to 
      allow defining new logical functions. 
      
</p>
<p>
      A major component of the proposed FE model is the Logical Function 
      Block (LFB) model.  Each distinct logical function in an FE is 
      modeled as an LFB.  Operational parameters of the LFB that must be 
      visible to the CE are conceptualized as LFB attributes.  These 
      attributes express the capability of the FE and support flexible 
      implementations by allowing an FE to specify which optional features 
      are supported. The attributes also indicate whether they are 
      configurable by the CE for an LFB class.  Configurable attributes 
      provide the CE some flexibility in specifying the behavior of an 
      LFB.  When multiple LFBs belonging to the same LFB class are 
      instantiated on an FE, each of those LFBs could be configured with 
      different attribute settings.  By querying the settings of the 
      attributes for an instantiated LFB, the CE can determine the state 
      of that LFB.  
      
</p>
<p>
      Instantiated LFBs are interconnected in a directed graph that 
      describes the ordering of the functions within an FE.  This directed 
      graph is described by the topology model.  The combination of the 
      attributes of the instantiated LFBs and the topology describe the 
      packet processing functions available on the FE (current state). 
      
</p>
<p>
      Another key component of the FE model is the FE attributes. The FE 
      attributes are used mainly to describe the capabilities of the FE, 
      but they also convey information about the FE state. 
      
</p>
<p>
      The FE model includes only the definition of the FE Object LFB 
      itself.  Meeting the full set of working group requirements requires 
      other LFBs.  The class definitions for those LFBs will be provided 
      in other documents.

      the CE must learn and control by communicating with the FEs (or by 
      other means).  Most of this communication will happen in the post-
      association phase using the ForCES protocol.  The following types of 
      information must be exchanged between CEs and FEs via the ForCES 
      protocol: 
      
</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>FE topology query; 
</li>
<li>FE capability declaration; 
</li>
<li>LFB topology (per FE) and configuration capabilities query; 
</li>
<li>LFB capability declaration; 
</li>
<li>State query of LFB attributes; 
</li>
<li>Manipulation of LFB attributes; 
</li>
<li>LFB topology reconfiguration.
</li>
</ol>
<p> 
      Items 1) through 5) are query exchanges, where the main flow of 
      information is from the FEs to the CEs.  Items 1) through 4) are 
      typically queried by the CE(s) in the beginning of the post-
      association (PA) phase, though they may be repeatedly queried at any 
      time in the PA phase.  Item 5) (state query) will be used at the 
      beginning of the PA phase, and often frequently during the PA phase 
      (especially for the query of statistical counters). 
      
</p>
<p>
      Items 6) and 7) are "command" types of exchanges, where the main 
      flow of information is from the CEs to the FEs.  Messages in Item 6) 
      (the LFB re-configuration commands) are expected to be used 
      frequently.  Item 7) (LFB topology re-configuration) is needed only 
      if dynamic LFB topologies are supported by the FEs and it is 
      expected to be used infrequently.   
      
</p>
<p> 
      The inter-FE topology (item 1 above) can be determined by the CE in 
      many ways.  Neither this document nor the Forces protocol mandates a 
      specific mechanism.  The LFB Class definition does include the 
      capability for an FE to be configured with, and provides to the CE 
      in response to a query, the identity of its neighbors. There may 
      also be defined specific LFB classes and protocols for neighbor 
      discovery.  Routing protocols may be used by the CE for adjacency 
      determination.  The CE may be configured with the relevant 
      information.

      The actual encoding of these messages is defined by the ForCES 
      protocol and beyond the scope of the FE model.  Their discussion is 
      nevertheless important here for the following reasons: 
      
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
       These PA model components have considerable impact on the FE 
       model.  For example, some of the above information can be 
       represented as attributes of the LFBs, in which case such 
       attributes must be defined in the LFB classes. 
       
</li>
<li>
       The understanding of the type of information that must be 
       exchanged between the FEs and CEs can help to select the 
       appropriate protocol format and the actual encoding method 
       (such as XML, TLVs). 
       
</li>
<li>
       Understanding the frequency of these types of messages should 
       influence the selection of the protocol format (efficiency 
       considerations). 
       
</li>
</ul>
<p> 
      An important part of the FE model is the port the FE uses for its 
      message exchanges to and from the CE.  In the case that a dedicated 
      port is used for CE-FE communication, we propose to use a special 
      port LFB, called the CE-FE Port LFB (a subclass of the general Port 
      LFB in Section 6.1), to model this dedicated CE-FE port.  The CE-FE 
      Port LFB acts as both a source and sink for the traffic from and to 
      the CE.  Sometimes the CE-FE traffic does not have its own dedicated 
      port, instead the data fabric is shared for the data plane traffic 
      and the CE-FE traffic.  A special processing LFB can be used to 
      model the ForCES packet encapsulation and decapsulation in such 
      cases.

FE Topology Query</h3>

<p>
      An FE may contain zero, one or more external ingress ports. 
      Similarly, an FE may contain zero, one or more external egress 
      ports.  In other words, not every FE has to contain any external 
      ingress or egress interfaces.  For example, 
      <a class='info' href='#Figure10'>Figure&nbsp;9<span> (</span><span class='info'>An example of two FEs connected together</span><span>)</span></a> shows two 
      cascading FEs.  FE #1 contains one external ingress interface but no 
      external egress interface, while FE #2 contains one external egress 
      interface but no ingress interface.  It is possible to connect these 
      two FEs together via their internal interfaces to achieve the 
      complete ingress-to-egress packet processing function. This provides 
      the flexibility to spread the functions across multiple FEs and 
      interconnect them together later for certain applications.  
      
</p>
<p>
      While the inter-FE communication protocol is out of scope for 
      ForCES, it is up to the CE to query and understand how multiple FEs 
      are inter-connected to perform a complete ingress-egress packet 
      processing function, such as the one described in 
      <a class='info' href='#Figure10'>Figure&nbsp;9<span> (</span><span class='info'>An example of two FEs connected together</span><span>)</span></a>.  The 
      inter-FE topology information may be provided by FEs, may be hard-
      coded into CE, or may be provided by some other entity (e.g., a bus 
      manager) independent of the FEs.  So while the ForCES protocol 
      supports FE topology query from FEs, it is optional for the CE to 
      use it, assuming the CE has other means to gather such topology 
      information.

<p> 
      Once the inter-FE topology is discovered by the CE after this query, 
      it is assumed that the inter-FE topology remains static.  However, 
      it is possible that an FE may go down during the NE operation, or a 
      board may be inserted and a new FE activated, so the inter-FE 
      topology will be affected.  It is up to the ForCES protocol to 
      provide a mechanism for the CE to detect such events and deal with 
      the change in FE topology.  FE topology is outside the scope of the 
      FE model.

FE Capability Declarations</h3>

<p>
      FEs will have many types of limitations.  Some of the limitations 
      must be expressed to the CEs as part of the capability model.  The 
      CEs must be able to query these capabilities on a per-FE basis.

</p>
<ul class="text">

LFB Topology and Topology Configurability Query</h3>

<p>
      The ForCES protocol must provide the means for the CEs to discover 
      the current set of LFB instances in an FE and the interconnections 
      between the LFBs within the FE.  In addition, sufficient information 
      should be available to determine whether the FE supports any CE-
      initiated (dynamic) changes to the LFB topology, and if so, 
      determine the allowed topologies.  Topology configurability can also 
      be considered as part of the FE capability query as described in 
      Section 9.3.

<a name="rfc.section.7.4"></a><h3>7.4.&nbsp;
LFB Capability Declarations</h3>

<p>
      LFB class specifications define a generic set of capabilities. 
      When an LFB instance is implemented (instantiated) on a vendor's FE, 
      some additional limitations may be introduced.  Note that we discuss 
      only those limitations that are within the flexibility of the LFB 
      class specification.  That is, the LFB instance will remain 
      compliant with the LFB class specification despite these 
      limitations.  For example, certain features of an LFB class may be 
      optional, in which case it must be possible for the CE to determine 
      if an optional feature is supported by a given LFB instance or not. 
      Also, the LFB class definitions will probably contain very few 
      quantitative limits (e.g., size of tables), since these limits are 
      typically imposed by the implementation.  Therefore, quantitative 
      limitations should always be expressed by capability arguments. 
      
</p>
<p>
      LFB instances in the model of a particular FE implementation will 
      possess limitations on the capabilities defined in the corresponding 
      LFB class.  The LFB class specifications must define a set of 
      capability arguments, and the CE must be able to query the actual 
      capabilities of the LFB instance via querying the value of such 
      arguments.  The capability query will typically happen when the LFB 
      is first detected by the CE.  Capabilities need not be re-queried in 
      case of static limitations.  In some cases, however, some 
      capabilities may change in time (e.g., as a result of 
      adding/removing other LFBs, or configuring certain attributes of 
      some other LFB when the LFBs share physical resources), in which 
      case additional mechanisms must be implemented to inform the CE 
      about the changes. 
      
</p>
<p>
      The following two broad types of limitations will exist: 
      
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
      Qualitative restrictions.  For example, a standardized multi-
      field classifier LFB class may define a large number of 
      classification fields, but a given FE may support only a subset 
      of those fields. 
      
</li>
<li>
      Quantitative restrictions, such as the maximum size of tables, 
      etc. 
      
</li>
</ul>
<p>
      The capability parameters that can be queried on a given LFB class 
      will be part of the LFB class specification.  The capability 
      parameters should be regarded as special attributes of the LFB.  The 
      actual values of these arguments may be, therefore, obtained using 
      the same attribute query mechanisms as used for other LFB 
      attributes. 
      
</p>
<p>
      Capability attributes will typically be read-only arguments, but in 
      certain cases they may be configurable.  For example, the size of a 
      lookup table may be limited by the hardware (read-only), in other 
      cases it may be configurable (read-write, within some hard limits). 
      
</p>
<p>
      Assuming that capabilities will not change frequently, the 
      efficiency of the protocol/schema/encoding is of secondary concern. 
      
</p>
<p>
      Much of this restrictive information is captured by the component
      property information, and so can be access uniformly for all information
      within the model.

      LFB attributes:

This section contains an example LFB definition.  While some 
properties of LFBs are shown by the FE Object LFB, this endeavors to 
show how a data plain LFB might be build.  This example is a 
fictional case of an interface supporting a coarse WDM optical 
interface carry Frame Relay traffic.  The statistical information 
(including error statistics) is omitted.

</p>
<p>
Later portions of this example include references to protocol operations.
The operations described are operations the protocol needs to support.
The exact format and fields are purely informational here, as the protocol
document defines the precise syntax and symantics of its operations.

Data Handling</h3>

<p>
      This LFB is designed to handle data packets coming in from or going 
      out to the external world.  It is not a full port, and it lacks many 
      useful statistics.  But it serves to show many of the relevant 
      behaviors. 
      
</p>
<p> 
      Packets arriving without error from the physical interface come in 
      on a Frame Relay DLCI on a laser channel.  These two values are used 
      by the LFB too look up the handling for the packet.  If the handling 
      indicates that the packet is LMI, then the output index is used to 
      select an LFB port from the LMItoFE port group.  The packet is sent 
      as a full Frame Relay frame (without any bit or byte stuffing) on 
      the selected port.  The laser channel and DLCI are sent as meta-
      data, even though the DLCI is also still in the packet. 
      
</p>
<p>
      Good packets that arrive and are not LMI and have a frame relay type 
      indicator of IP are sent as IP packets on the port in the DatatoFE 
      port group, using the same index field from the table based on the 
      laser channel and DLCI.  The channel and DLCI are attached as meta-
      data for other use (classifiers, for example.) 
      
</p>
<p>
      The current definition does not specify what to do if the Frame 
      Relay type information is not IP. 
      
</p>
<p>
      Packets arriving on input ports arrive with the Laser Channel and 
      Frame Relay DLCI as meta-data.  As such, a single input port could 
      have been used.  With the structure that is defined (which parallels 
      the output structure), the selection of channel and DLCI could be 
      restricted by the arriving input port group (LMI vs. data) and port 
      index.  As an alternative LFB design, the structures could require a 
      1-1 relationship between DLCI and LFB port, in which case no meta-
      data would be needed.  This would however be quite complex and 
      noisy.  The intermediate level of structure here allows parallelism 
      between input and output, without requiring excessive ports.

Setting up a DLCI</h3>

<p>
      When a CE chooses to establish a DLCI on a specific laser channel, 
      it sends a SET request directed to this LFB.  The request might look 
      like 
     
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
      T = SET-OPERATION
        T = PATH-DATA
          Path: flags = none, length = 4, path = 2, channel, 4, entryIdx
          DataRaw: DLCI, Enable(1), false, out-idx
</pre></div>
<p>
      Which would establish the DLCI as enabled, with traffic going to a 
      specific entry of the output port group DatatoFE.  (The CE would 
      ensure that output port is connected to the right place before 
      issuing this request.) 
      
</p>
<p>
      The response would confirm the creation of the specified entry.
      This table is structured to 
      use separate internal indices and DLCIs.  An alternative design 
      could have used the DLCI as index, trading off complexities. 
      
</p>
<p>
      One could also imagine that the FE has an LMI LFB.  Such an LFB 
      would be connected to the LMItoFE and LMIfromFE port groups.  It 
      would process LMI information.  It might be the LFBs job to set up 
      the frame relay circuits.  The LMI LFB would have an alias entry 
      that points to the Frame Relay circuits table it manages, so that it 
      can manipulate those entities.

<a name="rfc.section.8.1.2"></a><h3>8.1.2.&nbsp;
Error Handling </h3>

<p>
      The LFB will receive invalid packets over the wire.  Many of these 
      will simply result in incrementing counters.  The LFB designer might 
      also specify some error rate measures.  This puts more work on the 
      FE, but allows for more meaningful alarms. 
      
</p>
<p>
      There may be some error conditions that should cause parts of the 
      packet to be sent to the CE.  The error itself is not something that 
      can cause an event in the LFB.  There are two ways this can be 
      handled. 
      
</p>
<p>
      One way is to define a specific component to count the error, and a 
      component in the LFB to hold the required portion of the packet.  The 
      component could be defined to hold the portion of the packet from the 
      most recent error.  One could then define an event that occurs 
      whenever the error count changes, and declare that reporting the 
      event includes the LFB field with the packet portion.  For rare but 
      extremely critical errors, this is an effective solution.  It 
      ensures reliable delivery of the notification.  And it allows the CE 
      to control if it wants the notification.  
      
</p>
<p>
      Another approach is for the LFB to have a port that connects to a 
      redirect sink.  The LFB would attach the laser channel, the DLCI, 
      and the error indication as meta-data, and ship the packet to the 
      CE. 
      
</p>
<p>
      Other aspects of error handling are discussed under events below.

LFB Components</h3>

<p>
      This LFB is defined to have two top level components.  One reflects 
      the administrative state of the LFB.  This allows the CE to disable 
      the LFB completely. 
      
</p>
<p>
      The other attribute is the table of information about the laser 
      channels.  It is a variable sized array.  Each array entry contains 
      an identifier for what laser frequency this entry is associated 
      with, whether that frequency is operational, the power of the laser 
      at that frequency, and a table of information about frame relay 
      circuits on this frequency.  There is no administrative status since 
      a CE can disable an entry simply by removing it.  (Frequency and 
      laser power of a non-operational channel are not particularly 
      useful.  Knowledge about what frequencies can be supported would be 
      a table in the capabilities section.) 
      
</p>
<p>
      The Frame Relay circuit information contains the DLCI, the 
      operational circuit status, whether this circuit is to be treated as 
      carrying LMI information, and which port in the output port group of 
      the LFB traffic is to be sent to.  As mentioned above, the circuit 
      index could, in some designs, be combined with the DLCI.

<a name="rfc.section.8.3"></a><h3>8.3.&nbsp;
Capabilities</h3>

<p>
The capability information for this LFB includes whether the 
underlying interface is operational, how many frequencies are 
supported, and how many total circuits, across all channels, are 
permitted.  The maximum number for a given laser channel can be 
determined from the properties of the FrameRelayCircuits table.  A 
GET-Properties on path 2.channel.4 will give the CE the properties 
of the array which include the number of entries used, the first 
available entry, and the maximum number of entries permitted.

<a name="rfc.section.8.4"></a><h3>8.4.&nbsp;
Events</h3>

<p>
      This LFB is defined to be able to generate several events that the 
      CE may be interested in.  There are events to report changes in 
      operational state of frequencies, and the creation and deletion of 
      frequency entries.  There is an event for changes in status of 
      individual frame relay circuits.  So an event notification of 
      61.5.3.11 would indicate that there had been a circuit status change 
      on subscript 11 of the circuit table in subscript 3 of the frequency 
      table.  The event report would include the new status of the circuit 
      and the DLCI of the circuit.  Arguably, the DLCI is redundant, since 
      the CE presumably knows the DLCI based on the circuit index.  It is 
      included here to show including two pieces of information in an 
      event report. 
      
</p>
<p>
      As described above, the event declaration defines the event target, 
      the event condition, and the event report content.  The event 
      properties indicate whether the CE is subscribed to the event, the 
      specific threshold for the event, and any filter conditions for the 
      event. 
      
</p>
<p>
      Another event shown is a laser power problem.  This event is 
      generated whenever the laser falls below the specified threshold.  
      Thus, a CE can register for the event of laser power loss on all 
      circuits.  It would do this by: 
      
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
      T = SET-Properties
        Path-TLV: flags=0, length = 2, path = 61.4
          Path-TLV: flags = property-field, length = 1, path = 2
            Content = 1 (register)
          Path-TLV: flags = property-field, length = 1, path = 3
            Content = 15 (threshold)
</pre></div>
<p>
      This would set the registration for the event on all entries in the 
      table.  It would also set the threshold for the event, causing 
      reporting if the power falls below 15.  (Presumably, the CE knows 
      what the scale is for power, and has chosen 15 as a meaningful 
      problem level.) 
      
</p>
<p>
      If a laser oscillates in power near the 15 mark, one could get a lot 
      of notifications.  (If it flips back and forth between 9 and 10, 
      each flip down will generate an event.)  Suppose that the CE decides 
      to suppress this oscillation somewhat on laser channel 5.  It can do 
      this by setting the variance property on that event.  The request 
      would look like: 
      
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
      T = SET-Properties
        Path-TLV: flags=0, length = 3, path = 61.4.5
          Path-TLV: flags = property-field, length = 1, path = 4
            Content = 2 (hysteresis)
</pre></div>
<p>
      Setting the hysteresis to 2 suppress a lot of spurious 
      notifications.  When the level first falls below 10, a notification 
      is generated.  If the power level increases to 10 or 11, and then 
      falls back below 10, an event will not be generated.  The power has 
      to recover to at least 12 and fall back below 10 to generate another 
      event.  Once common cause of this form of oscillation is when the 
      actual value is right near the border.  If it is really 9.5, tiny 
      changes might flip it back and forth between 9 and 10.  A variance 
      level of 1 will suppress this sort of condition.  Many other events 
      have oscillations that are somewhat wider, so larger variance 
      settings can be used with those.

 IANA Considerations</h3>

<p>
      This model creates the need for unique class names and numeric class 
      identifiers.  To meet that goal, IANA will maintain a registry of 
      LFB Class names, corresponding class identifiers, and the document 
      which defines the LFB Class.  The registry policy is simply first 
      come first served with regard to LFB Class names.  With regard to 
      LFB Class identifiers, identifiers less than 65536 are reserved for 
      assignment by RFCs.  Identifiers above 65536 are available for 
      assignment on a first come, first served basis.  Registry entries 
      must be documented in a stable, publicly available form. 
      
</p>
<p>
      The LFBLibrary element and all of its sub-elements are defined in 
      the following namespace:

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>
      The FE model describes the representation and organization of data 
      sets and components in the FEs.  The ForCES framework document [2] 
      provides a comprehensive security analysis for the overall ForCES 
      architecture.  For example, the ForCES protocol entities must be 
      authenticated per the ForCES requirements before they can access the 
      information elements described in this document via ForCES.  Access 
      to the information contained in the FE model is accomplished via the 
      ForCES protocol, which will be defined in separate documents, and 
      thus the security issues will be addressed there.
