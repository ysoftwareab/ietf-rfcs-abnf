                  Appliance Class Identifier Option      January 2001 
                                    
1. Abstract 
    
   The Appliance Class Identifier option is used by a Dynamic Host 
   Configuration Protocol (DHCP) client to identify the type of 
   appliance it belongs to.  The information contained in this option is 
   an opaque field that represents the appliance class of which 
   identifies the type of client.  Based on this class, a DHCP server 
   selects the appropriate address pool to assign an address to the 
   client and the appropriate configuration parameters.  This option 
   should be selected by the appliance manufacturer and included in the 
   DHCP Discover/Request messages. 
 
2. Conventions used in this document 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1]. 
    
3. DHCP Terminology  
        
   - "DHCP client"  
      
   A DHCP client or "client" is an Internet host using DHCP to obtain 
   configuration parameters such as a network address.      
    
   - "DHCP server" 
    
   A DHCP server is an Internet host that returns configuration 
   parameters to DHCP clients. 
    
   - "Appliance" 
    
   An appliance is a DHCP client that not what is a special function 
   device such as an IP phone. 
    
   - "Appliance manufacturer" 
    
   The entity who manufacturers the appliance or has it manufactured in 
   their name. 
    
    
4. Overview 
    
   New and emerging IP based appliances (devices) may need to be 
   identified by DHCP servers differently than other DHCP clients.  
   These new appliances may require IP addresses and DHCP supplied 
   options different than other DHCP clients.  Network devices such as 
   routers and firewalls will require special handling of some 
   appliances.  For example, an IP phone (appliance) may require an IP 
   address that will not be translated by the router and may require 
   unique options such as a Call Agent server IP address or a DNS

                  Appliance Class Identifier Option      January 2001 
                                    
   server IP address used exclusively for Voice over IP networks.  
   These appliances may need to have separate IP address pools 
   allocated just for the various appliances.  The client identifies 
   itself as a specific appliance class, by this new option, to the 
   DHCP Server.  The DHCP shall issue an IP address allocated for that 
   appliance type from the DHCP server.  This ensures no computer, 
   printer, etc. receives an IP address allocated for a specific  
   appliance type.  The DHCP server should support multiple Appliance 
   Classes. 
 
    
5. The Appliance Class Identifier Option 
    
   The code for this option is TBD. 
    
   The Appliance Class Identifier is used by the DHCP Client to 
   optionally identify the appliance class it represents.  A DHCP 
   server uses the Appliance Class Identifier to choose the IP address 
   pool it allocates an IP address from and to select any other 
   appliance specific configuration option(s). 
    
   This option carries only one Appliance Class Identifier. 
    
   The DHCP server MUST return the Appliance Class Identifier in the 
   DHCP offer-s. 
    
   The DHCP client must reject the DHCP offer if it does not contain 
   the Appliance Class Identifier. 
    
   The format of this option is as follows: 
    
            Code   Len   Value 
           +-----+-----+-------------------------------------+ 
           | TBD |  N  | Appliance Class Data                | 
           +-----+-----+-------------------------------------+ 
    
   A server not equipped to interpret the appliance class should ignore 
   it.  The server should report the unmatched class event. 
 
 
6. IANA Considerations 
 
   Option TBD has been assigned by IANA for this option. 
 
 
7. Security Considerations 
 
   DHCP currently provides no authentication or security mechanisms.  
   Potential exposures to attack are discussed is section 7 of the 
   protocol specification. 
    
   This lack of authentication mechanism means that a DHCP server cannot 
   check if a client or user is authorized to use a given appliance

   class. This introduces an obvious vulnerability when using the 
   appliance class option.  For example, if the appliance class is used 
   to give out a special parameter (e.g., a particular call agent 
   server), there is no way to authenticate a client and it is therefore 
   impossible to check if a client is authorized to use this parameter.
