 IANA registration of SDP 'proto' attribute for transporting RTP Media
                  over TCP under various RTP profiles.
           draft-nandakumar-mmusic-proto-iana-registration-00

Abstract

   RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for
   applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or
   simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services.  The
   data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow
   monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large
   multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification
   functionality.

   This document describes how to express RTP media transport over TCP
   in SDP (Session Description Protocol) under various configurations.
   This document defines 'TCP/RTP/AVPF', 'TCP/RTP/SAVP', 'TCP/RTP/
   SAVPF', 'TCP/TLS/RTP/SAVP', 'TCP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF' protocol identifiers
   for SDP.

1.  Overview

   SDP (Session Description Protocol) [RFC4566] provides a general-
   purpose format for describing multimedia sessions in announcements or
   invitations.  [RFC4145] specifies a general mechanism for describing
   and establishing TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) streams with
   [RFC4571] defining a method for framing Real-time Transport Protocol
   (RTP) and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) packets onto a connection-
   oriented transport (such as TCP) .  [RFC4572] extends [RFC4145] for
   describing TCP-based media streams that are protected using TLS
   (Transport Layer Security).

   The RTP specification [RFC3550] establishes a registry of profile
   names for use by higher-level control protocols, such as the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP), to refer to transport methods.  This
   document describes the following new SDP transport protocol
   identifiers for transporting RTP Media over TCP.

   TCP/RTP/AVPF: to describe RTP Media with RTCP-based Feedback
   [RFC4585] over TCP.

   TCP/RTP/SAVP: to describe Secure RTP Media [RFC3711] over TCP.

   TCP/RTP/SAVPF: to describe Secure RTP Media with RTCP-based Feedback
   [RFC5124] over TCP.

   TCP/TLS/RTP/SAVP: to describe Secure RTP Media [RFC3711] on top of
   TLS [RFC5246] over TCP.

   TCP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF: to describe Secure RTP Media with RTCP-based
   Feedback [RFC5124] on top of TLS over TCP.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Protocol Identifier

   The 'm' line in SDP specifies, among other items, the transport
   protocol to be used for the media in the session.  See the "Media
   Descriptions" section of SDP [RFC4566] for a discussion on transport
   protocol identifiers.

   This specification defines new protocol identifiers 'TCP/RTP/AVPF',
   'TCP/RTP/SAVP', 'TCP/RTP/SAVPF', 'TCP/TLS/RTP/SAVP', 'TCP/TLS/RTP/
   SAVPF' which indicates that the media described will use TCP as the
   transport protocol.

      When a RTP/AVPF stream is transported over the TCP transport, the
      proto identifier SHALL be 'TCP/RTP/AVPF'.

      When a RTP/SAVP stream is transported over the TCP transport, the
      proto identifier SHALL be 'TCP/RTP/SAVP'.

      When a RTP/SAVPF stream is transported over the TCP transport, the
      proto identifier SHALL be 'TCP/RTP/SAVPF'.

      When RTP/SAVP stream is transport over TLS with TCP transport, the
      proto identifier SHALL be 'TCP/TLS/RTP/SAVP'.

      When RTP/SAVPF stream is transport over TLS with TCP transport,
      the proto identifier SHALL be 'TCP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF'.

   An 'm' line that specifies these new proto identifiers MUST further
   qualify the application-layer protocol using an fmt identifier.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document describes five new proto values: 'TCP/RTP/AVPF',
   'TCP/RTP/SAVP', 'TCP/RTP/SAVPF', 'TCP/TLS/RTP/SAVP', 'TCP/TLS/RTP/
   SAVPF' as defined in the section Section 3.  These proto values
   should be registered by the IANA under "Session Description Protocol
   (SDP) Parameters" under "proto".

5.  Security Considerations

   The new "proto" identifiers registered by this document in the SDP
   parameters registry maintained by IANA is primarily for use by the
   offer/answer model of the Session Description Protocol [RFC3264] for
   the negotiation and establishment of RTP based Media over the TCP
   transport.  These additional SDP "proto" identifiers does not
   introduce any security considerations beyond those detailed in
   Section 7 of [RFC4566].
