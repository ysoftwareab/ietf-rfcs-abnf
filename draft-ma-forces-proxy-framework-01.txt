1. Introduction 

   ForCES is intended to separate control planes and forwarding planes 
   through defining a standard communication protocol between CE 
   (Control Element) and FE (Forwarding Element) such that CEs and FEs 
   can communicate with each other seamlessly as long as they follow the 
   protocol even if they are made by different equipment manufacturers.

   Thus, from this point of perspective, CEs and FEs can be separated 
   really. This will accelerate the innovation of technologies greatly. 

   In order to integrate traditional routers into ForCES-based NEs to 
   reduce CAPex and OPex, this document presents a framework in which, 
   to fulfill this goal, different restrictions on traditional routers 
   are discussed and corresponding solutions are suggested.    

    

2. Motivation 

2.1.  Traditional CE limit 

   In traditional routers there exists a kind of CEs which use ASIC to 
   implement certain control functionalities. These control 
   functionalities include device management, which is responsible for 
   the switchover of switch fabric and control plane, alarming when 
   environment temperature or humidity exceeds specified threshold value 
   or voltage is abnormal, resetting main board or IO card, launching 
   instructions to load code etc. However, ForCES protocol is rather 
   complex for such CEs compared with such functionalities as described 
   above, and ASIC is incapable of implementing ForCES protocol.  

   In the second case, to support ForCES protocol inside a traditional 
   router needs a large mount of modifications to already existing 
   private communication protocols and other functionality code 
   consequently, which will take a high risk.  

    

2.2. Traditional FE limit 

    

   In the third case, now many different forwarding models are employed 
   in industry, but none of them is perfect. One model may be preferable 
   over other models regarding one or many aspects, for instance, 
   resource consumption, forwarding performance, bandwidth requirement 
   or stability etc. However, it may still have some inherent defects 
   with regard to some other metrics. Now the fact that different 
   manufacturers implement different forwarding models in their FEs will 
   certainly lead to the inconsistency of data formats when a packet is 
   forwarded from ingress FE to an egress FE. Consequently an ingress FE 
   implementing one forwarding model cannot interoperate with an egress 
   FE implementing another forwarding model.

   Last but not least, the same problem happens to the switch fabric. 
   Now many different interface specifications of switch fabric have 
   been defined. System packet Interface (SPI) and Common Switch 
   Interface (CSIX) are these examples. However, in reality, not all FEs 
   support many different kinds of interface at the same time. A 
   consequent problem is how to guarantee that a FE with just one kind 
   of interfaces (SPI or CSIX etc) can interoperate with a switch fabric 
   with some other incompatible interface.   

    

3. ForCES proxy 

3.1. CE proxy 

    

   With regard to the first two limits in traditional CEs in last 
   section, a proxy CE can be used to terminate the Fp reference point 
   instead of the physical CE. This allows the FE to communicate to the 
   physical CE via the proxy CE by using ForCES protocol. A proxy CE can 
   communicate to the corresponding physical CE by using private 
   communication protocols rather than ForCES protocol. In such an 
   implementation, the combination of the CE proxy and physical CE 
   becomes one logical CE entity as shown in Figure 1. 

   A CE proxy must implement ForCES protocol itself. At the same time, 
   it can function as a translator of different message formats between 
   ForCES protocol and original private communication protocols being 
   used between physical CE and FE. With regard to the first limit 
   described in the section 2, a CE proxy must work as a sole physical 
   entity. Or a CE proxy can function as a logical entity which exists in 
   some ForCES-based CE. In this case, it must differentiate a message 
   destined to itself from one destined to the deputized physical CE. A 
   CE proxy also can deputize multiple physical CEs at the same time. In 
   this situation, the CE proxy can discover the functionalities of 
   physical CEs through configurations or some kind of automatic 
   discovery mechanism, and they must reach a consensus on the way used 
   to differentiate messages from different physical CEs such that 
   different messages from FEs can be delivered to the correct physical 
   CEs and vice versa.  

   A CE proxy can connect to CE manager. During the pre-association 
   phrase, CE manager can decide if a CE proxy can join a NE.

3.2. FE proxy 

    

   In the case where an ingress FE implementing one kind of forwarding 
   model cannot communicate with an egress FE implementing another 
   forwarding model, a FE proxy can be used to convert different message 
   formats of different forwarding models. Alternately, ForCES protocol 
   must be extended to define a forwarding-model-conversion LFB that can 
   do the same work. In particular, a FE proxy (forwarding-model-
   conversion LFB) is responsible for converting the formats of head 
   part of packets. In the case where the interface specifications of FE

   and switch fabric are incompatible, a physical FE proxy must be used 
   to perform format conversion. At the same time, FE proxy must implement 
   ForCES protocol so that it can communicate with its corresponding CE. 
   And CE can configure FE proxy dynamically through ForCES protocol. 

   A FE proxy either can only have the functionality of format 
   conversion as a sole physical entity or it can function as a logical entity and 
   coexist with some ForCES-based FE. A FE proxy can deputize one or many FEs 
   at the same time. The combination of a FE proxy and its deputized FE 
   can be thought of a logical FE to join a ForCES-based NE as shown in 
   Figure 2.  

   During the pre-association phrase, a FE proxy can contact a FE 
   manager to determine which NE it should belong to and which CEs it 
   should communicate with. FE proxy must have the knowledge of what 
   forwarding model is used by its deputized FEs through negotiation. It 
   is necessary for FE proxy to enable or disable some functionality 
   according to the configuration specified by FE manager in a real-time 
   fashion.

3.3. Interoperation 

   In order to guarantee the interoperation between traditional routers 
   and CE/FE proxy, it is required that private communication protocol 
   inside traditional routers must be public. 

    

4. Security Considerations 

    

   A CE proxy and its corresponding physical CE can be located in two 
   different physical boxes. In this situation, some security 
   implications must be considered seriously, and corresponding security 
   mechanisms must be applied to prevent malicious attacks. Candidate 
   security mechanisms include all current available authorization and 
   authentication mechanisms. Which mechanism will be applied eventually 
   depends on the kind of attack and physical CE's potential supporting 
   authorization and authentication.  

   In the case where a FE proxy and its corresponding FEs also can be 
   located in different physical boxes, security implication must be 
   considered too. Some security authentication and authorization 
   mechanism can be applied to the private communication mechanism to 
   achieve dependability. All current available authentication 
   mechanisms can be candidates to be chosen carefully, which security 
   mechanism is fit for our purpose depends on the kind of attack and 
   FE's potential supporting authorization and authentication.
