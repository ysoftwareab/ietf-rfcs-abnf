2.  Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP- based internets.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing Frame Relay Switched
   Permanent Virtual Circuits (SPVCs).  This memo does not specify a
   standard for the Internet community.

3.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

   The major components of the SNMPv2 Network Management framework are
   described in the documents listed below.

   o    RFC 1902 [2] defines the Structure of Management

        Information (SMI), the mechanisms used for describing and
        naming objects for the purpose of management.

   o    STD 17, RFC 1213 [3] defines MIB-II, the core set of
        managed objects (MO) for the Internet suite of protocols.

   o    RFC 1905 [4] defines the protocol used for network access
        to managed objects.

   o    RFC 1604 [1] defines the protocol used for managing
        Frame Relay services.

   The framework is adaptable/extensible by defining new MIBs to suit
   the requirements of specific applications/protocols/situations.

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, the
   MIB.  Objects  in  the  MIB  are  defined  using the subset of
   Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI. In
   particular, each object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, which
   is an administratively assigned name. The object  type  together
   with  an  object  instance  serves  to uniquely  identify  a
   specific  instantiation  of the object.  For human convenience, often
   a textual string, termed the descriptor, is  used  to refer to the
   object type.

4.  Overview

   This MIB addresses the instances needed to manage the Frame Relay
   Forum's Implementation Agreement for SPVCs (FRF.10).  These instances
   are based on the ATM Forum Soft PVC MIB [5] objects to provide a
   consistent Switched PVC management model for both ATM and Frame Relay
   SPVCs.

   A Switched PVC (SPVC) is a virtual circuit that appears to the user
   to be a PVC but spans multiple networks as an SVC.  The originating
   network "ingress" endpoint is configured as one PVC endpoint and is
   configured with information (including a destination address)
   required to signal and establish an SVC across the NNI interfaces
   between networks.  The destination network "egress" endpoint is
   configured as the second PVC endpoint and is configured with the
   destination address.  The originating endpoint has the responsibility
   for establishing, releasing, and re-establishing the SPVC.

4.1. Originating Endpoint

   In order to configure the originating endpoint SPVC parameters, an
   entry in the PVC End-Point table and an entry in the Switched PVC
   table must be defined.  The PVC End-Point table entry (see the PVC



Coutts                    Expires May 13, 1999                  [Page 2]

INTERNET DRAFT            FR Switched PVC MIB          November 13, 1998


   End-Point Group in RFC 1604 [1]) identifies the bi-directional
   traffic parameters for the originating endpoint of the SPVC.  The
   Switched PVC table entry (defined in this SPVC MIB) identifies the
   destination address information (e.g., E.164 address) of the SPVC.
   Together these two entries provide the information required (by the
   network originating the SPVC) to signal an SVC across the NNI.

   A row in the PVC End-Point table must be created prior to creating a
   row in the Switched PVC table.  And the corresponding row in the PVC
   End-Point table must be active prior to activating the Switched PVC
   table row.  When the Switched PVC table row is made active, an
   attempt is made to set up a switched connection to an interface at
   the destination switch.

   Presently, the Frame Relay Service MIB (RFC 1604 [1]) does not
   include an SVC cross-connect table.  Once such a table is defined, an
   SVC cross-connect table entry should be created at the time the SPVC
   table row is made active;  and deleted at the time the SPVC table row
   is made inactive.

4.2. Terminating Endpoint

   The Switched PVC Address Table (defined in this SPVC MIB) is used to
   configure one or more addresses for each SPVC terminating endpoint
   interface.

   In order to configure the terminating endpoint PVC parameters (e.g.,
   terminating endpoint DLCI), an entry in the PVC End-Point table (see
   the PVC End-Point Group in RFC 1604 [1]) may be defined prior to the
   arrival of the Setup request.

4.3. Asymmetric and Symmetric SPVC Establishment

   The configuration of an originating SPVC endpoint and a terminating
   SPVC endpoint defines an "asymmetric" SPVC:  only one of the two SPVC
   endpoints has the capability to originate the SPVC.  FRF.10 also
   requires the capability to originate the SPVC from both of the SPVC
   endpoints ("symmetric" SPVC establishment).

   Configuration of the symmetric SPVC establishment case is
   accomplished by provisioning two asymmetric configurations (with the
   roles of originating endpoint and terminating endpoint reversed for
   one of the configurations).  The MIB defined herein will highlight
   differences between the asymmetric and symmetric cases where
   necessary.

   See FRF.10 for symmetric establishment procedures including handling
   of "call collisions".  For instance, FRF.10 indicates that only the

   "specificDlci" or "specificSpvcCorrelator" target select type may be
   used for symmetric establishment.  (This is because the call
   collision would not be detectable for the "anyDlci" target select
   type.)

4.4. FR/ATM SPVC Interworking

   This SPVC MIB also includes objects for performing FR/ATM service
   interworking.  The originating network "ingress" FR endpoint defined
   in this MIB can select an ATM VPI/VCI for the target destination.
   The originating endpoint can also select whether multiprotocol
   encapsulation translation between RFC 1490 and RFC 1483 is required.

   -- The PVC End-Point table entry (see the PVC End-Point Group in RFC 1604)
   -- identifies the bi-directional traffic parameters for the originating endpoint
   -- of the SPVC;  and the Switched PVC table entry (of this Switched PVC MIB)

   -- of the SPVC.  Together these two entries provide the information required
   -- (by the network originating the SPVC) to signal an SVC across the NNI.
   --
   -- To create and activate an SPVC at the originating endpoint, the following
   -- procedures shall be followed:
   -- 1).  Create an entry in the frPVCEndptTable (see RFC 1604).
   -- 2).  Create an entry in the frSwitchedPvcTable (in this MIB).
   -- 3).  Activate the frPVCEndptTable entry.
   -- 4).  When the corresponding row in the frSwitchedPvcTable (i.e., the rows with
   --      matching UNI/NNI logical port and matching DLCI index values) is set to
   --      'active', an attempt is made to set up a switched connection to an
   --      interface at the destination switch.

   -- The Switched PVC Address table (frSwitchedPvcAddressTable defined in this

   -- terminating endpoints).  Prior to creating and activating an SPVC at the
   -- originating endpoint (in the originating network), an entry must be created
   -- in the Switched PVC Address table in the network that terminates the SPVC.
   -- This terminating address corresponds to the target address configured in the

   -- End-Point table entry may be defined.  As a result, the PVC's inactive
   -- status can be signaled across the UNI/NNI prior to the arrival of the Setup

                    Virtual Connection (SPVC) originating at a switch interface.
                    An SPVC is a VC that is :
                    - provisioned at the originating (source) interface of the
                      connection.
                    - established by signalling procedures across a network to a
                      destination interface.

                    A row in the frPVCEndptTable must be created, defining a PVC
                    endpoint on the source interface, prior to creating an
                    frSwitchedPvcEntry row.  The row in the frPVCEndptTable must
                    be active prior to activating the frSwitchedPvcEntry row. The
                    contents of this table reflect only the characteristics unique
                    to a Switched PVC. The traffic and signalling parameters are
                    defined in the PVC endpoint row for the source interface.
                    Since the Low Layer Compatibility, Called Party Subaddress,
                    and Calling Party Subaddress information elements are used to
                    carry end-to-end information, they are not used in the
                    configuration of Switched PVC. Note that the User-User
                    Information information element is used to contain the
                    frSwitchedPvcTargetIdentifier if 'specificSpvcCorrelator' is
                    selected in the frSwitchedPvcTargetSelectType.

                    When a row is made active, an attempt is made to set up a
                    switched connection to an interface at the destination switch.
                    No objects (other that frSwitchedPvcAdminStatus and
                    frSwitchedPvcRowStatus) can be set while the row is active.

                    The combination of the frSwitchedPvcIfIndex and
                    frSwitchedPvcDlciIndex specified in the index clause of this entry
                    serves to identify the PVC endpoint on the source interface.

                    specified, the destination switch will choose the DLCI value.
                    In such a case, once the SPVC frSwitchedPvcOperStatus value is
                    'connected', the value of this object changes to 'specificDlci'

                    The DLCI value chosen will be available for reading in

                    supplied for object frSwitchedPvcTargetIdentifier
