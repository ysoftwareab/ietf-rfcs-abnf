1.  Introduction

   HTTP server push is a feature of HTTP/2 [RFC7540] and HTTP/QUIC
   [QUIC-HTTP] that allows a server to pre-emptively send HTTP resources
   to a client in association with a previous client-initiated request.
   Server push broke ground for new HTTP semantics that offer new HTTP
   application use cases; this has kicked the door down for additional
   semantics.

Internet-Draft              HTTP Server *ush                  March 2018


   Much of the success of HTTP Server Push can be attributed to its
   syllable count and structure.  The phrase rolls off the tongue with
   clear and concise meaning.  To capitalise on this, the document
   defines a suite of HTTP semantic extensions with identical syllabic
   structure: the *ush family (pronounced aster-ush).  Members of the
   *ush family enhance Server Push in various ways.

   For each member of the *ush family, this document adds a new HTTP/2
   SETTINGS Parameter (to those defined by [RFC7540] Section X.Y.Z), and
   a new HTTP/QUIC SETTINGS Parameter to those defined by [QUIC-HTTP]
   Section 5.2.5.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  The SETTINGS_ENABLE_CUSH Parameter

   The new parameter is SETTINGS_ENABLE_CUSH (type = 0xfab01).  This
   setting can be used to enable Server Cush, a more luxurious (cushy)
   form of Server Push.  The value of the parameter is an integer that
   MUST be 0 or 1.  Any value other than 0 or 1 MUST be treated as a
   connection error of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   The initial value is 0, which indicates that "cattle class" Server
   Push is preferred.

3.  The SETTINGS_ENABLE_DUSH Parameter

   The new parameter is SETTINGS_ENABLE_DUSH (type = 0xfab02).  This
   setting can be used to enable Server Dush, a more violent form of
   Server Push.  The value of the parameter is an integer that MUST be 0
   or 1.  Any value other than 0 or 1 MUST be treated as a connection
   error of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   The initial value is 0, which indicates that "care bear" Server Push
   is preferred.

4.  The SETTINGS_ENABLE_GUSH Parameter

   The new parameter is SETTINGS_ENABLE_GUSH (type = 0xfab03).  This
   setting can be used to enable Server Gush, a mode of Server Push that
   supports sudden overflows.  The value of the parameter is an integer

   that MUST be 0 or 1.  Any value other than 0 or 1 MUST be treated as
   a connection error of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   The initial value is 0, which indicates that "emotionally reserved"
   Server Push is preferred.

5.  The SETTINGS_ENABLE_HUSH Parameter

   The new parameter is SETTINGS_ENABLE_HUSH (type = 0xfab04).  This
   setting can be used to enable Server Hush, semantically equivalent to
   SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH but more polite.  The value of the parameter is
   an integer that MUST be 0 or 1.  Any value other than 0 or 1 MUST be
   treated as a connection error of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   The initial value is 0, which indicates that Server Push is not
   permitted.

6.  The SETTINGS_ENABLE_KUSH Parameter

   The new parameter is SETTINGS_ENABLE_KUSH (type = 0xfab05).  This
   setting can be used to enable Server Kush, a more mellow form of
   Server Push whose legality varies across territories.  The value of
   the parameter is an integer that MUST be 0 or 1.  Any value other
   than 0 or 1 MUST be treated as a connection error of type
   PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   The initial value is 0, which indicates that "legal" Server Push is
   preferred.

7.  The SETTINGS_ENABLE_LUSH Parameter

   The new parameter is SETTINGS_ENABLE_LUSH (type = 0xfab06).  This
   setting can be used to enable Server Lush, which permits only the
   push of resources related to vegetation.  The value of the parameter
   is an integer that MUST be 0 or 1.  Any value other than 0 or 1 MUST
   be treated as a connection error of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   The initial value is 0, which indicates that "eco-broad" Server Push
   is preferred.

8.  The SETTINGS_ENABLE_MUSH Parameter

   The new parameter is SETTINGS_ENABLE_MUSH (type = 0xfab07).  Mush has
   negative connotations so this setting is reserved and MUST NOT be
   used.

9.  The SETTINGS_ENABLE_RUSH Parameter

   The new parameter is SETTINGS_ENABLE_RUSH (type = 0xfab08).  This
   setting can be used to enable Server Rush, a mode that enables a
   server to push resources more quickly.  The value of the parameter is
   an integer that MUST be 0 or 1.  Any value other than 0 or 1 MUST be
   treated as a connection error of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   The initial value is 0, which indicates that "lazy" Server Rush is
   preferred.

10.  The SETTINGS_ENABLE_TUSH Parameter

   The new parameter is SETTINGS_ENABLE_TUSH (type = 0xfab09).  This
   setting can be used to enable Server Tush, a mode where the client
   will express dissaproval if the server takes too long to fulfill push
   promises.  The value of the parameter is an integer that MUST be 0 or
   1.  Any value other than 0 or 1 MUST be treated as a connection error
   of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   The initial value is 0, which indicates that "polite to the point"
   Server Push is preferred.

11.  The SETTINGS_ENABLE_BLUSH Parameter

   The new parameter is SETTINGS_ENABLE_BLUSH (type = 0xfab0a).  This
   setting can be used to enable Server Blush, a mode where the server
   should feel extra shame if it pushes resources that the client did
   not want.  The value of the parameter is an integer that MUST be 0 or
   1.  Any value other than 0 or 1 MUST be treated as a connection error
   of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   The initial value is 0, which indicates that "shameless" Server Push
   is preferred.

12.  The SETTINGS_ENABLE_FLUSH Parameter

   The new parameter is SETTINGS_ENABLE_FLUSH (type = 0xfab0b).  This
   setting can be used to enable Server Flush, a mode that respects the
   Coriolis effect across Northen and Southern hemispheres.  The value
   of the parameter is an integer that MUST be 0 or 1.  Any value other
   than 0 or 1 MUST be treated as a connection error of type
   PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   The initial value is 0, which indicates that "universal frame of
   reference" Server Push is preferred.

13.  The SETTINGS_ENABLE_PLUSH Parameter

   The new parameter is SETTINGS_ENABLE_PLUSH (type = 0xfab0c).  This
   setting is a synonym of SETTINGS_ENABLE_CUSH (Section 2).

14.  The SETTINGS_ENABLE_SLUSH Parameter

   The new parameter is SETTINGS_ENABLE_SLUSH (type = 0xfab0d).  This
   setting can be used to enable Server Slush, a mode that is overly
   sentimental.  This is most appropriate when re-establishing
   connections to servers.  The value of the parameter is an integer
   that MUST be 0 or 1.  Any value other than 0 or 1 MUST be treated as
   a connection error of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   The initial value is 0, which indicates that "cold hearted" Server
   Push is preferred.

15.  The SETTINGS_ENABLE_SMUSH Parameter

   The new parameter is SETTINGS_ENABLE_SMUSH (type = 0xfab0e).  This
   setting can be used to enable Server Mush, a logical union between
   SETTINGS_ENABLE_GUSH and SETTINGS_ENABLE_SLUSH.  The value of the
   parameter is an integer that MUST be 0 or 1.  Any value other than 0
   or 1 MUST be treated as a connection error of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   The initial value is 0, which indicates that "emotionally reserved
   and cold hearted" Server Push is preferred.
