Abstract

   This document describes the registration of the MIME sub-type
   application/xhtml+voice+xml.  This sub-type is intended for use as a
   media descriptor for XHTML+Voice multimodal language documents.  The
   XHTML+Voice 1.2 language specification is maintained by the VoiceXML
   Forum at <http://www.voicexml.org/specs/multimodal/x+v/12/>.

Internet-Draft   XHTML+Voice - application/xhtml+voice+xml Nov. 15, 2004


2. Introduction

   XHTML+VOice is a member of the XHTML family of document types, as
   specified by XHTML Modularization.  XHTML+Voice extends XHTML 1.1
   [XHTML11] with a modularized subset of VoiceXML 2.0 [VXML20], XML
   Events [XMLEVNTS], and a few extensions to both XHTML and VoiceXML
   2.0.  XHTML 1.1, VoiceXML 2.0 and XML Events are W3C Recommendations.

   The language integration defined by XHTML+Voice supports all modules
   defined by XHTML Modularization, and adds voice interaction to XHTML
   elements to enable multimodal applications.  The defined document
   type for XHTML+VOice is XHTML Host language document type conformant.

   XHTML+Voice 1.2 [XPLUSV12] is maintained by the VoiceXML Forum, at
   URI location <http://www.voicexml.org/specs/multimodal/x+v/12/>.

2.1 application/xhtml+voice+xml Usage

   The application/xhtml+voice+xml media type is intended to be a media
   descriptor for XHTML+Voice documents.

   This media type registration is not intended for email usage.

3. IANA Registration

      To: ietf-types@iana.org
      Subject: Registration of Standard MIME media type 
               application/xhtml+voice+xml

      MIME media type name: application

      MIME subtype name: xhtml+voice+xml

      Required parameters: none

      Optional parameters:
   version:  refers to the XHTML+Voice language version in the document.
             Acceptable values are 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 (default).

   charset:  has the same meaning as the text/html media type.  See
   section 2 of [RFC 2854].

      Encoding considerations: 7bit.  See section 4 of [RFC 2854].

      Security considerations:
 
   XHTML+Voice is an extension of XHTML and has the same security issues
   as XHTML.  These include interpreting anchors and forms in HTML

   documents, and scripting languages and other dynamic interactive
   capabilities.  See section 7 of [RFC 2854].

      Interoperability considerations :

   Because XHTML+Voice is built upon W3C standard recommendations, it is
   designed to be interoperable across a wide range of platforms and
   client devices.  Because the extensions to XHTML are identified by
   their namespaces, all browsers that have namespace support can run an
   XHTML+Voice document as an XHTML document without voice interaction.
      
     Published specification:

         The latest published version of XHTML+Voice is [XPLUSV12].

      Applications which use this media type:

         XHTML+Voice documents are intended to be deployed on the World
         Wide Web and rendered by multimodal browsers that support the
         visual and voice modes of interaction.  See section 2 of
         [RFC 2854].         

      Additional information:

         Magic number(s):  There is no single string that is always
             present.
         File extension(s): html, htm, mxml, xvml
         Macintosh File Type Code(s): TEXT

      Person & email address to contact for further information:

      Intended usage: COMMON

      Author/Change controller: Gerald McCobb

4. Fragment Identifiers

   See section 3 of [RFC 2854].

5. Recognizing XHTML+Voice files

   Because XHTML+Voice is XML, an XHTML+Voice document [optionally]
   starts with an XML declaration which begins with "<?xml" and has a
   DOCTYPE declaration "<!DOCTYPE html".  XHTML+Voice 1.2 has the


Mccobb                   Expires May 15, 2005                   [Page 3]

Internet-Draft   XHTML+Voice - application/xhtml+voice+xml Nov. 15, 2004


   following DOCTYPE declaration:
 
   <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//VoiceXML Forum//DTD XHTML+Voice 1.2//EN"
"http://www.voicexml.org/specs/multimodal/x+v/12/dtd/xhtml+voice12.dtd">
   
   Because XHTML+Voice is in the XHTML family of languages, the root
   element of an XHTML+Voice document is 'html' and '<html' can be found
   near the top of the document.  

6. Security Considerations

   Security considerations for this media type are discussed in the MIME
   type registration that appears in section 4.
