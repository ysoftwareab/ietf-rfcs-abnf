             YANG Groupings for TCP Clients and TCP Servers
                draft-ietf-netconf-tcp-client-server-06

Abstract

   This document defines three YANG modules: the first defines a
   grouping for configuring a generic TCP client, the second defines a
   grouping for configuring a generic TCP server, and the third defines
   a grouping common to the TCP clients and TCP servers.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines three YANG 1.1 [RFC7950] modules: the first
   defines a grouping for configuring a generic TCP client, the second
   defines a grouping for configuring a generic TCP server, and the
   third defines a grouping common to the TCP clients and TCP servers.

   It is intended that these groupings will be used either standalone,
   for TCP-based protocols, as part of a stack of protocol-specific
   configuration models.  For instance, these groupings could help
   define the configuration module for SSH, TLS, or HTTP based
   applications.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  The TCP Common Model

3.1.  Model Scope

   This document defines a common "grouping" statement for basic TCP
   connection parameters that matter to applications.  In some TCP
   stacks, such parameters can also directly be set by an application
   using system calls, such as the socket API.  The base YANG model in

Internet-Draft    Groupings for TCP Clients and Servers        June 2020


   this document focuses on modeling TCP keep-alives.  This base model
   can be extended as needed.

3.2.  Usage Guidelines for Configuring TCP Keep-Alives

   Network stacks may include "keep-alives" in their TCP
   implementations, although this practice is not universally accepted.
   If keep-alives are included, [RFC1122] [RFC793bis] mandates that the
   application MUST be able to turn them on or off for each TCP
   connection, and that they MUST default to off.

   Keep-alive mechanisms exist in many protocols.  Depending on the
   protocol stack, TCP keep-alives may only be one out of several
   alternatives.  Which mechanism(s) to use depends on the use case and
   application requirements.  If keep-alives are needed by an
   application, it is RECOMMENDED that the aliveness check happens only
   at the protocol layers that are meaningful to the application.

   A TCP keep-alive mechanism SHOULD only be invoked in server
   applications that might otherwise hang indefinitely and consume
   resources unnecessarily if a client crashes or aborts a connection
   during a network failure [RFC1122].  TCP keep-alives may consume
   significant resources both in the network and in endpoints (e.g.,
   battery power).  In addition, frequent keep-alives risk network
   congestion.  The higher the frequency of keep-alives, the higher the
   overhead.

   Given the cost of keep-alives, parameters have to be configured
   carefully:

   o  The default idle interval (leaf "idle-time") MUST default to no
      less than two hours, i.e., 7200 seconds [RFC1122].  A lower value
      MAY be configured, but keep-alive messages SHOULD NOT be
      transmitted more frequently than once every 15 seconds.  Longer
      intervals SHOULD be used when possible.

   o  The maximum number of sequential keep-alive probes that can fail
      (leaf "max-probes") trades off responsiveness and robustness
      against packet loss.  ACK segments that contain no data are not
      reliably transmitted by TCP.  Consequently, if a keep-alive
      mechanism is implemented it MUST NOT interpret failure to respond
      to any specific probe as a dead connection [RFC1122].  Typically a
      single-digit number should suffice.

   o  TCP implementations may include a parameter for the number of
      seconds between TCP keep-alive probes (leaf "probe-interval").  In
      order to avoid congestion, the time interval between probes MUST
      NOT be smaller than one second.  Significantly longer intervals

Internet-Draft    Groupings for TCP Clients and Servers        June 2020


      SHOULD be used.  It is important to note that keep-alive probes
      (or replies) can get dropped due to network congestion.  Sending
      further probe messages into a congested path after a short
      interval, without backing off timers, could cause harm and result
      in a congestion collapse.  Therefore it is essential to pick a
      large, conservative value for this interval.

3.3.  Tree Diagram

   This section provides a tree diagram [RFC8340] for the "ietf-tcp-
   common" module.

   module: ietf-tcp-common

       +-- keepalives! {keepalives-supported}?
          +-- idle-time         uint16
          +-- max-probes        uint16
          +-- probe-interval    uint16
     grouping tcp-connection-grouping
       +-- keepalives! {keepalives-supported}?
          +-- idle-time         uint16
          +-- max-probes        uint16
          +-- probe-interval    uint16

3.4.  Example Usage

   This section presents an example showing the "tcp-common-grouping"
   populated with some data.

   <tcp-common xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-tcp-common">
     <keepalives>
       <idle-time>15</idle-time>
       <max-probes>3</max-probes>
       <probe-interval>30</probe-interval>
     </keepalives>
   </tcp-common>

3.5.  YANG Module

   The ietf-tcp-common YANG module references [RFC6991].

   server" module.

       +-- local-address    inet:ip-address

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules defined in this document are designed to be accessed
   via YANG based management protocols, such as NETCONF [RFC6241] and
   RESTCONF [RFC8040].  Both of these protocols have mandatory-to-
   implement secure transport layers (e.g., SSH, TCP) with mutual
   authentication.

   The NETCONF access control model (NACM) [RFC8341] provides the means
   to restrict access for particular users to a pre-configured subset of
   all available protocol operations and content.

   Since the modules defined in this document only define groupings,
   these considerations are primarily for the designers of other modules
   that use these groupings.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG modules that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      None of the writable/creatable/deletable data nodes             in
    the YANG modules defined in this document are considered more
                sensitive or vulnerable then standard configuration.

   Some of the readable data nodes in the YANG modules may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      None of the readable data nodes in the YANG modules
   defined in this document are considered more sensitive or vulnerable
                then standard configuration.

   This document does not define any RPC actions and hence this section
   does not consider the security of RPCs.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  The IETF XML Registry

   This document registers two URIs in the "ns" subregistry of the IETF
   XML Registry [RFC3688].  Following the format in [RFC3688], the
   following registrations are requested:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-tcp-client
      Registrant Contact: The NETCONF WG of the IETF.
      XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-tcp-server
      Registrant Contact: The NETCONF WG of the IETF.
      XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

7.2.  The YANG Module Names Registry

   This document registers two YANG modules in the YANG Module Names
   registry [RFC6020].  Following the format in [RFC6020], the following
   registrations are requested:

      name:         ietf-tcp-common
      namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-tcp-common
      prefix:       tcpcmn
      reference:    RFC DDDD

      name:         ietf-tcp-client
      namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-tcp-client
      prefix:       tcpc
      reference:    RFC DDDD

      name:         ietf-tcp-server
      namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-tcp-server
      prefix:       tcps
