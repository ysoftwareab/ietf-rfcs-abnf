The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extension to Support Server Redirect
                   draft-zhou-tls-server-redirect-00

Abstract

   In some applications, e.g., Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure
   (HTTPS) visit, a client request needs to be redireted to the
   operator's web server for authentication or overdue processing.  This
   specification defines a new extension of TLS handshake protocol
   [RFC5246] to transmit the redirect Uniform/Universal Resource Locator
   (URL) for HTTPS applications.

1.  Introduction

   With the rapid growing of HTTPS applications (e.g., Google), the
   redirect problems need to be solved in the scenarios which support
   HTTPS visit.  One example scenario is web authentication (in most
   wifi accesses): when the user wants to visit the web page after
   acquiring the address, it will be redirected to the operator's
   authentication page to authenticate.  Another scenario is overdue:
   when the user wants to visit the web page but it is overdue, it will
   be redirected to the operator's overdue reminding page.

   In the HTTPS redirect scenarios, the first server, e.g., Broadband
   Remote Access Server(BRAS), will receive the HTTPS visit request on
   behalf of the website.  It communicates with the client using the web
   server's certificate for TLS negotiation before redirecting the
   request to the web server.  However, the client (e.g., personal
   computer) will print warnings after checking that the certificate
   does not match the domain name it visited.  The user usually turns
   off the page in this case.  Therefore, the redirect process fails
   because the user will have no access to the authentication or overdue
   redirect page.

   In [RFC5246], the client sends the ClientHello message to initiate
   the TLS handshake process.  To support the web server redirect, an
   indication needs to carried in the ClientHello message.  The first
   server, e.g., BRAS, will then send the redirect URL to the client
   before sending the certificate response or with the certificate
   response message.  This document describes a new extension to the TLS
   handshake packet to support such redirection in HTTPS applications.

Internet-Draft        TLS Server Redirect Extension         October 2015


2.  Terminology

3.  TLS Handshake Message Extension

   This document defines a TLS extension in the "Hello Extensions"
   message to carry the "redirect_url_enable" for indicating redirect
   URL, and defines a new handshake message "Server Redirect" to
   transmit the redirect URL string.

3.1.  The Extended Hello Extensions

   The "Hello Extensions" message is extended to support the redirect
   URL:

          enum {
          redirect_url_enable(TBA), (65535)
          } ExtensionType;

   The length value is zero, carrying no data.

3.2.  The Extended Server Redirect

   A new TLS handshake packet, Server Redirect, is defined to transmit
   the redirect URL string.  The structure is specified as:

   struct {
                 uint8 urllength; /*redirect_url_length*/
                opaque string<0-255>; /*redirect_url*/
    } ServerRedirect;

   Accordingly, a new handshake type is defined as below:

                 select (HandshakeType) {
                 case hello_request:       HelloRequest;
                 case client_hello:        ClientHello;
                 case server_hello:        ServerHello;
                 case certificate:         Certificate;
                 case server_key_exchange: ServerKeyExchange;
                 case certificate_request: CertificateRequest;
                 case server_hello_done:   ServerHelloDone;
                 case certificate_verify:  CertificateVerify;
                 case client_key_exchange: ClientKeyExchange;
                 case finished:            Finished;
                 case  server_redirect:  Server Redirect
             } body;

   always sent.

   An example packet processing for HTTPS redirect is illustrated in
   Figure 1:

   1.  The client sends a ClientHello packet, carrying the extended
       redirect_url_enable option, to indicate that the client supports
       the new HTTPS redirect function.

   2.  When the first server, which is on behalf of the operator (e.g.,
       BRAS), receives the request, it sends the Server Redirect packet
       to the client after sending the ServerHello.  The URL of the web
       server is contained in the Server Redirect packet and the
       certificate of the web server is contained in the Server
       Certificate packet.

   3.  The client will check whether the certificate and the URL match
       after receiving the ServerRedirect.  It generates the redirect

       reminder page if they match.  Otherwise, it will generate the
       fault warning page.  In this case, the client continues the TLS
       handshake with the first server if it selects to continue
       visiting.

   4.  After the TLS handshake message finishes between the client and
       the first server, and after receiving the Get packet, the client
       responds with the Redirect HTTPS packet, which carries the
       redirect URL and some other information related to web page,
       e.g., Media Access Control (MAC) address, option 82.

   5.  The client will turn off the connection when it does not receive
       the Redirect HTTPS or the URL in the Redirect HTTPS is different
       with the former URL in the Server Redirect.
