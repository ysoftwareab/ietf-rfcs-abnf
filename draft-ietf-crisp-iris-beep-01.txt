1. Introduction and Motivations

   The proposal in this document describes the IRIS [8] application
   transport binding using BEEP [2].  Requirements for IRIS and the
   specification in this document are outlined in CRISP [14].

   The choice of BEEP as the transport substrate is primarily driven by
   the need to re-use an existing, well-understood protocol with all the
   necessary features to support the requirements.  This gives
   implementers a wealth of toolkits and debugging gear for use in
   constructing both servers and clients and allows operators to apply
   existing experience in issues of deployment.  It is also felt that
   the construction of a simple application transport for the specific
   purpose of IRIS would yield a similar, though likely smaller and
   probably less complete, standard after taking into consideration such
   matters as framing, authentication, etc.

   Precedents for using other transport mechanisms in layered
   applications do not seem to fit with the design goals of IRIS.  HTTP
   [5] offers many features employed for use by similar applications.
   However, it is not the intention of IRIS to be put to such uses as
   by-passing fire-walls, co-mingling URI schemes, or any other such
   methods which might lead to confusion between IRIS and traditional
   World Wide Webb applications.  Beyond adhering to the guidelines
   spelled out in RFC3205 [6], the use of HTTP also offers many other
   challenges that quickly erode its appeal.  For example, the
   appropriate use of TLS [4] with HTTP is defined by RFC2817 [3], but
   the common use as described in RFC2818 [10] is usually the only
   method in most implementations.

   Finally, the straight use of TCP such as that specified by EPP-TCP
   [9] does not offer the client negotiation characteristics needed by a
   referral application where a single client, in the act of processing
   a query, may traverse multiple servers operating with different
   parameters.

2. Document Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [7].

3. BEEP Profile Identification

   The BEEP profile identifier for IRIS is a URI composed of the IRIS
   schema URN, followed by a slash, followed by an IRIS registry id
   (which is a URN).  Since the IRIS schema URN is compliant with
   XML_URN, it may be abbreviated according to the rules of IRIS.  To
   simplify matters, it MUST be abbreviated in the use of this profile
   identifier.  The registry ID maybe abbreviated according to the rules
   of IRIS if it qualifies for abbreviation under the rules of IRIS.

   The following is an example of an IRIS profile identifier for BEEP.
   It identifies the version of IRIS to match that specified by
   "urn:iana:params:xml:ns:iris1" with a registry ID for the registry
   type identified by "urn:iana:params:xml:ns:dreg1".


     http://iana.org/beep/transient/crisp/iris1/dreg1

   The full ABNF [12] with certain values included from IRIS [8]
   follows.

     profile            = profile-uri "/" iris-urn "/" registry-id
     profile-uri        = "http://iana.org/beep/transient/crisp/"
     iris-urn           = // as specified by IRIS
     registry-id        = // as specified by IRIS

   This URI is used in the "profile" element in BEEP during channel
   creation.  According to the rules of BEEP, multiple "profile"
   elements may be offered thus allowing for a negotiation of the
   version of IRIS to be used for every registry type being served.

   Once this profile is accepted and the channel is created, the state
   of the channel is considered ready to exchange IRIS messages.

4. IRIS Message Packages

   The BEEP profile for IRIS transmits XML [1] containing the requests
   and responses for IRIS registries.  These XML instances MUST be
   encoded as UTF-8 [13] using the media-type of "application/xml"
   according to RFC3023 [18].  A registry type MAY define other message
   packages that are not IRIS XML instances (e.g.  binary images
   referenced by an IRIS response).

5. IRIS Message Patterns

5.1 Registry Dependent Patterns

   Because each registry type is defined by a separate BEEP profile,
   each registry type MAY define a separate message pattern.  These
   patterns MUST be within the allowable scope of BEEP [2].  If a
   registry type does not explicitly define a message pattern, the
   default pattern is used (see Section 5.2

5.2 Default Pattern

   The default BEEP profile for IRIS only has a one-to-one request/
   response message pattern.  This exchange involves sending an IRIS XML
   instance, which results in a response of an IRIS XML instance.

   The request is sent by the client using an "MSG" message containing a
   valid IRIS XML instance.  The server responds with an "RPY" message
   containing a valid IRIS XML instance.  The "ERR" message is used for
   sending fault codes.  The list of allowable fault codes is listed in
   BEEP [2].

6. URI Definition

   An IRIS URI [11] has the following general syntax.

   iris://<authority>/<registry-id>/<entity-class>/<entity-name>

   The full ABNF [12] with certain values included from RFC2396 [11]
   follows.


     iris-uri           = "iris://" authority "/" registry-id [ "/"
                          entity-class "/" entity-name ]
     authority          = // as specified by RFC2396
     registry-id        = // as specified by IRIS
     entity-class       = *(unreserved | escaped)
     entity-name        = *(unreserved | escaped)
     reserved           = // as specified by RFC2396
     escaped            = "%" hex hex
     hex                = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" |
                          "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" | "A" | "B" |
                          "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "a" | "b" |
                          "c" | "d" | "e" | "f"

   An IRIS URI MUST NOT be a relative URI.  In addition, valid URI's
   with this scheme MUST always contain a registry ID (namespace
   identifier), an entity class, and an entity name.  In addition, the
   entity class and entity name MUST be of the UTF-8 [13] character set
   encoded with "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" as specified by
   URL_ENC [15].

   When the entity-class and entity-name components are not specified,
   the defaults "service-definition" and "id" MUST be implied.  For
   example, "iris://com/dreg" is to be interpreted "iris://com/dreg/
   service-definition/id".

   Definitions of registry types SHOULD attempt to make the names of
   entity classes transcribable.  Despite the fact that URI's are not
   friendly to all humans, they care should be taken in their definition
   to make them readable and transcribable.  One aspect of this is the
   use of dashes to separate meaningful words over the use of other
   styles such as camel back notation (e.g.  "service-definition"
   instead of "serviceDefinition").

7. URI Resolution

7.1 Registry Dependent Resolution

   The IRIS URI resolution process is dependent on the registry type
   used in the URI itself and keyed off of the registry ID that appears
   in it.  In other words, the way in which the authority component of
   the URI is processed is dependent on the registry ID.

   If a registry type does not explicitly define an IRIS URI resolution
   process, the default URI resolution process is used (see Section 7.2.
   In all cases, the authority component of the URI MUST be compliant
   with RFC2396 [11].

7.2 Default Resolution

   In the default resolution process, the authority component of an IRIS
   URI may only contain a domain name, a domain name accompanied by a
   port number, or an IP address accompanied by a port number.  The
   authority component of the scheme indicates the server or set of
   servers authoritatively responsible for a domain according to SRV
   [19] records in DNS if a domain is specified or indicates the
   specific server to be queried if an IP address is specified.

   The rules for resolution are:

   o  If the authority component is a domain name accompanied by a port
      number as specified by RFC2396, the domain name is converted to an
      IP address via an A record to the DNS.

   o  If the authority component is a domain name by itself, the SRV
      algorithm is used with a service parameter of "iris" and a
      protocol parameter of "tcp" to determine the IP/TCP addressing
      information.  If no appropriate SRV RRs are found (e.g., for
      "_iris._tcp.example.com"), then the DNS is queried for the A RRs
      corresponding to the domain name and the port number used is the
      well-known port assigned by the IANA for IRIS using BEEP.

   o  If the authority component is an IP address, then the DNS is not
      queried, and the IP address is used directly.  If the port number
      is present, it is used directly; otherwise, the port number used
      is the well-known port assigned by the IANA for IRIS over BEEP.

   The use of an IPv6 address in the authority component MUST conform to
   RFC2732 [17].

   Here are some examples of IRIS URI's and their meaning in the default
   resolution process:

8. Server Authentication Methods

8.1 Registry Dependent Methods

   When using the TLS [4] tuning profile in BEEP, it is possible to
   verify the authenticity of the server.  However, a convention is
   needed to conduct this authentication.  This convention dictates the
   name of the authority used by a client to ask for authentication
   credentials so that server knows which set of credentials to pass
   back.  Because this is dependent on the authority component of the
   URI, each registry type must define a server authentication method.

   If a registry type does not explicitly define a server authentication
   method, the default method is used (see Section 8.2.

8.2 Default Authentication Method

   The default server authentication method is as follows:

   1.  When connecting to a server, the client MUST present the name of
       the authority to the server using the BEEP [2] serverName
       mechanism.  For instance, if the URI "iris://com/dreg/domain/
       example.com" is being resolved, the client would use the
       serverName="com" attribute during the BEEP session instantiation.

   2.  During TLS negotiation, the server presents to the client a
       certificate for the authority given in serverName.  This
       certificate MUST be an X509 [16] certificate and contain a
       subjectAltName extension of the type dNSName.

   3.  The certificate MUST cryptographically verify according to the
       procedures of TLS.

   4.  The client then checks the content of the dNSName.  It must
       exactly match the authority given the server using serverName.

11. Internationalization Considerations

   URI's are not considered to be internationalized.  The topic of
   internationalized URI's is beyond the scope of this document and is
   not specific to the IRIS URI scheme defined here.  It is an issue to
   be addressed by a larger scope.

   The entity class and entity name components of an IRIS URI is
   specified using UTF-8.  This has been done for interoperability
   purposes.

12. IANA Considerations

   The IANA will need to be asked to register the IRIS URI scheme.  The
   IANA will need to assign a standard port number to IRIS over BEEP.

13. Security Considerations

   Implementers should be fully aware of the security considerations
   given by IRIS [8], BEEP [2], and TLS [4].  With respect to server
   authentication with the use of TLS, see .

   Clients SHOULD be prepared to use the following BEEP tuning profiles:

   o  http://iana.org/beep/SASL/DIGEST-MD5 - for user authentication
      without the need of session encryption.

   o  http://iaan.org/beep/SASL/OTP - for user authentication without
      the need of session encryption.

   o  http://iana.org/beep/TLS using the TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
      cipher - for encryption.

   o  http://iana.org/beep/TLS using the TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
      cipher with client-side certificates - for encryption and user
      authentication.

   IRIS contains a referral mechanism as a standard course of operation.
   However, care should be taken that user authentication mechanisms do
   not hand user credentials to untrusted servers.  Therefore, clients
   SHOULD NOT use the http://iana.org/beep/SASL/PLAIN tuning profile.
