Abstract

   Application Layer Gateway (ALG) has been widely implemented and used
   to support address and port translation in the payload for some well-
   known protocols.  Due to the lackness of standardization on
   addressing ALG related issues, a number of serious problems are faced
   by service deployments and upgrades.  This document specifies the
   common problems for ALG in various aspects.  In addition, some
   collected feedbacks are also listed as the next steps to tackle these
   problems.

Internet-Draft            ALG Problem Statement                July 2010


1.  Introduction

   Application Layer Gateway (ALG) has been widely used to support
   address and port translation in the payload for some well-known
   protocols, such as

   o  FTP (active mode)

   o  ICMP

   o  RTSP

   o  XMPP

   o  H323

   o  MGCP

   o  DNS

   ALG is a component which may be implemented along with or inside
   firewall or NAT.  Due to the need of address and port translation in
   the payload, many network devices support ALG functions for a large
   number of such protocols.

   Due to the lackness of standardization on addressing ALG related
   issues, a number of serious problems are faced by service deployments
   and upgrades.  For example, there are no commonly accepted
   requirements for network vendors to handle common ALG functions, such
   as out-of-order packets and TCP reassembly, which makes service
   integration and deployment very difficult.  There is no guideline or
   Best Current Practice (BCP) on ALG implementation and deployment to
   mitigate the risks introduced by ALG related issues.

   This document specifies the common problems for ALG in various
   perspectives.  In addition, some collected feedbacks are also listed
   as the proposed next steps to tackle these problems.


2.  Problems

   This section describes the common problems faced by ALG in various
   categories.  More details are provided inside each category to
   reflect current status.

Internet-Draft            ALG Problem Statement                July 2010


2.1.  Implementation inconsistencies among vendors

   Different vendors have their own interpretation on how ALG should
   behavior for certain protocols.  Due to the lackness of
   standardization, such ALG implementation inconsistencies have a big
   impact on evaluation and integration.

   To make things worse, different product lines belonging to the same
   network vendor may have inconsistent ALG implementations, which can
   introduce more confusions and troubles on its customers.

2.2.  High operation costs

   There are many ALG related factors that can easily increase operation
   costs, especially for large service providers.  First, some
   applications need different versions of different ALGs.  This can
   complicate the deployment on ALGs with respect to the associated
   applications which may or may not be in the control of the same
   service provider.

   ISP test time for updated ALG version will be influenced by new
   behaviors of updated ALG and the associated applications.  Note that
   there is no standardized document to follow on new behaviors of
   updated ALG.  In addition, network vendors' turnaround time to add
   new ALG may be an issue for desired new service deployment.  In some
   cases, the turnaround time for the fix or patch on existing ALGs
   cannot satisfy the urgent need of restore the desired services.

2.3.  Broken services in new deployment

   New services based on certain protocols are introduced to ISP or ASP
   networks by facing the challenges of compatible ALG.  Some of these
   new services had been broken down because of ALG related issues.

   For example, media streaming service provided by a big ASP in USA was
   broken down because of ALG's misbehavior.  Similarly, multimedia
   streaming service in another ISP in Asia found out the service
   disruptions to some customers due to ALG related issues.

2.4.  Emerging demand on ALG in IPv6 transition

   IPv6 has been gaining momentum for mitigating the issue of IPv4
   address exhausion.  With more trial-out and build-up of IPv6 networks
   and devices, the communications between IPv6 networks and IPv4
   networks will introduce more issues on ALG for proper address and
   port translations.

   For example, the scenario of IPv6 applications accessing IPv4 servers

   requires the correct address and port translation in the payload to
   set up the session for certain protocols.  In the future, more
   deployment scenarios may be introduced to enforce the evolutions of
   ALG in IPv6 translation.

2.5.  Conflict with encrypted or integrity protected protocols

   When the payload is encrypted, ALG cannot decrypt the payload and
   finish the replacement on the desired fields.

   When the payload is protected with integrity check, ALG cannot
   generate the new integrity check after the address and port
   translation.

2.6.  Interferance with NAT traversal

   ALG can interfere with evolution of protocols to handle NAT
   themselves.  For example, ICE can be used for NAT traversal, which
   can help a set of protocols to avoid ALG issues.  The pros and cons
   with ALG and without ALG need to be studied with respect to
   deployment scenarios.

2.7.  Regulation restriction

   When ISPs modify the payload of certain applications using ALGs, the
   changes may trigger regulation issues.

   For example, the address and port translation in ALG may break
   location awareness in a VoIP service provider, which is regulated on
   emergency call in USA.


3.  Conclusion and Recommendation

   These major problems faced by ALG have been paid attention to among
   ISPs, ASPs, and network vendors.  The conclusion is that
   standardization on ALG related issues will definitely benefit the
   community for addressing these problems.

   From the collected feedbacks, the next steps can be taken as follows:

   o  Identify the key general requirements for ALG

   o  Provide the recommendations and the common solutions to satisfying
      each of these requirements

   o  Standardize the ALG behavior on some major protocols for better
      inter-operations

   o  Recommendations or guidelines for deployment and updates of ALG

   o  Document the non-standard implementations and provide with an
      ongoing registry for such non-standard implementations for new
      ALGs
