Abstract

   The PMIPv6 protocol provides local mobility to a mobile node without
   its involvement in mobility management.  To provide session
   continuity without involvement of the mobile node, MAG and LMA
   maintain forwarding information for the mobile node's HNP.  If the
   mobile node is a mobile router and the PMIPv6 domain is a home
   network of it, the MAG and LMA should also have forwarding state for
   MNP.  This memo describes several NEMO related issues including this.

2.  Introduction

   The PMIPv6 protocol provides local mobility to a mobile node without
   requiring any involvement of a mobile node stack.  From the
   perspective of the mobile node the entire PMIPv6 domain looks like a
   single link.  This allows the mobile node in a PMIPv6 domain to
   operate as if it were still in home link while it roams in the PMIPv6
   domain.

   The PMIPv6 protocol has two principal functional entities which
   maintain forwarding information for the mobile node.  MAG (Mobile
   Access Gateway) and LMA (Local Mobility Anchor) are them.  The MAG
   maintains data path for the mobile node, and the LMA maintains a
   collection of routes for individual mobile node while the mobile node
   roams in the PMIPv6 domain.

   Those forwarding information, however, is for the traffic for mobile
   node.  It doesn't care about the traffic for LFN of the mobile
   router.  If a mobile node is a mobile router, MAG and LMA of current
   PMIPv6 protocol could not handle the traffic for LFN of mobile
   router.

   The goal of this memo is to provide short descriptions for NEMO
   related issues like this.

3.  Assumptions

3.1.  Local Mobility Management and Granularity of Mobility Management

   Mobility management can be broken down into localized mobility
   management and global mobility management.  Localized mobility
   involves movements across some administratively and geographically
   contiguous set of subnets, whereas the mobile node that implements a
   global mobility protocol is able to move across broad administrative,
   geographical, and topological domains.  The local subdomains of these
   domains could be domains implementing localized mobility management
   or not.

3.2.  The Requirements for NetLMM protocol

   [netlmm-goals] includes following goals for NetLMM protocol.

   o  The NetLMM protocol should be able to support unmodified mobile
      nodes (goal #7 of [netlmm-goals]).

   o  Localized mobility management is independent of global mobility
      management (goal #10 of [netlmm-goals]).

   Considering these two goals for NetLMM protocol, we can say that a
   mobile node in PMIPv6 domain could be a host or router (mobile
   router), and even if a mobile node is a mobile router the PMIPv6
   domain should support it without requiring any modification of it.

3.3.  A PMIPv6 domain as a Mobile Router's Home Network

   This memo deals with a PMIPv6 domain which is a mobile router's home
   network.

4.  Issues for NEMO in PMIPv6 domain

4.1.  MNP for mobile router

   [netlmm-goals] describes the goals (or requirements) for NetLMM.
   Section 3.7 "Support for Unmodified Mobile Nodes (Goal #7)" says that
   the NetLMM solution should be able to support any mobile node without
   requiring localized mobility management software on the mobile node.
   In this context, the mobile node can be an ordinary host or a node
   that has global mobility protocol.

   The entire PMIPv6 domain appears as a single link to the mobile node,
   so the mobile node that has a global mobility protocol will not
   trigger the global mobility protocol while roaming in the PMIPv6
   domain.  In this situation most of the mobile nodes that have a host-
   based global mobility protocol may work well, but if the mobile node
   is a mobile router there may be problems in forwarding packets from
   LFN.

   The PMIPv6 protocol has two principal functional entities which are
   called MAG (Mobile Access Gateway) and LMA (Local Mobility Anchor).
   The MAG maintains data path for the mobile node, and the LMA
   maintains a collection of routes for individual mobile node while the
   mobile node roams in the PMIPv6 domain.

   Those forwarding information, however, is for the traffic for mobile
   node.  It doesn't care about the traffic for LFN of the mobile
   router.  If a mobile node is a mobile router, MAG and LMA of current
   PMIPv6 protocol could not handle the traffic for LFN of mobile
   router.

   If the mobile router boots up in a normal home network and then moves
   into a PMIPv6 domain this problem would not occur, because the mobile
   router will make a tunnel to the home agent and forwards all packets
   from its mobile network via this tunnel to the home agent.  In this
   case the source address of packets is the CoA of the mobile router
   and the MAG and LMA can handle these packets.

4.2.  Ingress Filtering for MNP of Mobile Router

   If the MAG doesn't have any information about MNP, the packets from
   LFN might be filtered out at the MAG.

4.3.  LMA as HA of Mobile Router

   In PMIPv6 domain LMA is usually HA for a mobile router, and MAG
   advertises RA message on behalf of LMA (HA).  Therefore the RA
   message advertised by the MAG should not have 'H' bit because the HA

   and the mobile router are not on same link.

4.4.  Dynamic Routing Protocol at LMA

   [RFC3963] describes that intra-domain routing protocol like RIPng can
   be used as an alternative way to set up forwarding state for MNP at
   the home agent.  After bootstrapping of the mobile router, the mobile
   router and the home agent start to exchange routing updates messages
   periodically.  Normally a request message is sent as multicast from
   the routing protocol's specific port, but the mobile router couldn't
   receive this message because the LMA and the mobile router are not in
   the same link (the mobile router is not the tunnel's end point).  As
   part of normal routing protocol operation, the next hop information
   in routing entries is filled with the mobile router's link-local
   address with the outgoing interface set to the bi-directional tunnel,
   but link-local address can't be used because of same reason as
   before.

5.  Proposed Solution

5.1.  Using MNP option

   If we can know MNP for the mobile router it could be registered on a
   profile server in advance.  Once a mobile router enters PMIPv6 domain
   it performs access authentication.  During this procedure a MAG can
   get MNP together with HNP for the mobile router, and then the MAG
   sends BU including MNP and HNP to the LMA.  While the mobile router
   roams in the PMIPv6 domain, the MAG that the mobile router is
   attached to should always send BU containing HNP and MNP.
