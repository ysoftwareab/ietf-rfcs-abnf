Abstract

   RFC7575 defines Intent as an abstract high-level policy used to
   operate the network. Intent management system includes an interface
   for users to input requests and an engine to translate the intents
   into the network configuration and manage their lifecycle. Up to
   now, there is no commonly agreed definition, interface or model of
   intent.

   This document discusses what intent means to different stakeholders,
   describes different ways to classify intent, and an associated
   taxonomy of this classification. This is a foundation for discussion
   intent related topics.

1. Introduction

   Different SDOs, including IETF [ANIMA], ONF [ONF], ONOS [ONOS], have
   proposed intent as a declarative interface for defining a set of
   network operations to execute.

   Although there is no common definition or model of intent which are
   agreed by all SDOs, there are several shared principles:

      o intent should be declarative, using and depending on as few
   deployment details as possible and focusing on what and not how

      o intent should provide an easy-to-use interface, and use
   terminology and concepts familiar to its target audience

      o intent should be vendor-independent and portable across
   platforms

      o the intent framework should be able to detect and resolve
   conflicts between multiple intents.

   SDOs have different perspectives on what intent is, what set of
   actors it is intended to serve, and how it should be used.  This
   document provides several dimensions to classify intents.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3. Abstract intent requirements

   In order to understand the different intent requirements that would
   drive intent classification, we first need to understand what intent
   means for different intent users.

3.1. What is Intent?

   The term Intent has become very widely used in the industry for
   different purposes, sometimes it is not even in agreement with SDO
   shared principles mentioned in the Introduction. Different
   stakeholders consider an intent to be an ECA policy, a GBP policy, a
   business policy, a network service, a customer service, a network
   configuration, application / application group policy, any
   operator/administrator task, network troubleshooting / diagnostics /
   test, a new app, a marketing term for existing
   management/orchestration capabilities, etc. Their intent is
   sometimes technical, non-technical, abstract or technology specific.
   For some stakeholders, intent is a subset of these and for other
   stakeholders intent is all of these. It has in some cases become a
   term to replace a very generic 'service' or 'policy' terminology.

   While it is easier for those familiar with different standards to
   understand what service, CFS, RFS, resource, policy continuum, ECA
   policy, declarative policy, abstract policy or intent policy is, it
   may be more difficult for the wider audience. Intent is very often
   just a synonym for policy. Those familiar with policies understand
   the difference between a business, intent, declarative,  imperative
   and ECA policy. But maybe the wider audience does not understand the
   difference and sometimes equates the policy to an ECA policy.

   Therefore, it is important to start a discussion in the industry
   about what intent is for different solutions and intent users. It is
   also imperative to try to propose some intent categories /

   classifications that could be understood by a wider audience. This
   would help us define intent interfaces, DSLs and models.

3.2. Intent Solutions & Intent Users

   Different Solutions and Actors have different requirements,
   expectations and priorities for intent driven networking. They
   require different intent types and have different use cases. Some
   users are more technical and require intents that expose more
   technical information. Other users do not understand networks and
   require intents that shield them from different networking concepts
   and technologies. The following are the solutions and intent users
   that intent driven networking needs to support:

            +--------------------+------------------------------------+
            | Solutions          | Intent Users                       |
            +--------------------+------------------------------------+
            | Carrier Networks   | Network Operator                   |
            |                    | Service Designers                  |
            |                    | Service Operators                  |
            |                    | Customers/Subscribers              |
            +--------------------+------------------------------------+
            | DC Networks        | Cloud Administrator                |
            |                    | Underlay Network Administrator     |
            |                    | App Developers                     |
            |                    | End Users                          |
            +--------------------+------------------------------------+
            | Enterprise Networks| Enterprise Administrator           |
            |                    | App Developers                     |
            |                    | End Users                          |
            +--------------------+------------------------------------+



   o For carrier networks scenario, for example, if the end users
      wants to watch high-definition video, then the intent is to
      convert the video image to 1080p rate for the users.

   o For DC networks scenario, administrators have their own clear
      network intent such as load balancing. For all traffic flows that
      need NFV service chaining, restrict the maximum load of any VNF
      node/container below 50% and the maximum load of any network link
      below 70%.

   o For Enterprise Networks scenario, enterprise administrators
      express their intent from an external client(application service
      provider).For example, when hosting a video conference, multiple
      remote access is required. The intent expressed to the network
      operator: For any user of this application, the arrival time of
      hologram objects of all the remote tele-presenters should be
      synchronised within 50ms to reach the destination viewer for each
      conversation session.



3.3. Current Problems & Requirements

   Network APIs and CLIs are too complex due to the fact that they
   expose technologies & topologies. App developers and end-users do
   not want to set IP Addresses, VLANs, subnets, ports, etc. Operators
   and administrators would also benefit from the simpler interfaces,
   like:

   o Allow Customer Site A to be connected to Internet via Network B

   o Allow User A to access all internal resources, except the Server
      B

   o Allow User B to access Internet via Corporate Network A

   o Move all Users from Corporate Network A to the Corporate Network
      B

   o Request Gold VPN service between my sites A, B and C

   o Provide CE Redundancy for all Customer Sites

   o Add Access Rules to my Service

   Networks are complex, with many different protocols and
   encapsulations. Some basic questions are not easy to answer:

   o Can User A talk to User B?

   o Can Host A talk to Host B?

   o Are there any loops in my network?

   o Are Network A and Network B connected?

   o Can User A listen to communications between Users B & C?

Internet-Draft          Intent Classification            November 2019


   Operators and Administrators manually troubleshoot and fix their
   networks and services. They instead want:

   o a reliable network that is self-configured and self-assured based
      on the intent

   o to be notified about the problem before the user is aware

   o automation of network/service recovery based on intent (self-
      healing, self-optimization)

   o to get suggestions about correction/optimization steps based on
      experience (historical data & behaviour)

   Therefore, Operators and Administrators want to:

   o simplify and automate network operations

   o simplify definitions of network services

   o provide simple customer APIs for Value Added Services (operators)

   o be informed if the network or service is not behaving as
      requested

   o enable automatic optimization and correction for selected
      scenarios

   o have systems that learn from historic information and behaviour

   End-Users cannot build their own services and policies without
   becoming technical experts and they must perform manual maintenance
   actions. Application developers and end-users/subscribers want to be
   able to:

   o build their own network services with their own policies via
      simple interfaces, without becoming networking experts

   o have their network services up and running based on intent and
      automation only, without any manual actions or maintenance

3.4. Intent Types that need to be supported

   The following intent types need to be supported, in order to address
   the requirements from different solutions and intent users:

   o Customer network service intent

Internet-Draft          Intent Classification            November 2019


        o for customer self-service

        o for service operator orders

        o for intent driven network configuration, verification,
          correction and optimization

   o Network resource management

        o For network configuration

        o For automated lifecycle management of network configurations

        o For network resources (switches, routers, routing, policies,
          underlay)

   o Cloud and cloud resource management

        o For DC configuration, VMs, DB Servers, APP Servers

        o For communication between VMs

        o For cloud resource lifecycle management (policy driven self-
          configuration & auto-scaling & recovery/optimization)

   o Network Policy intent

        o For security, QoS, application policies, traffic steering, etc

        o For configuring & monitoring policies, alarms generation for
          non-compliance, auto-recovery

   o Task based intents

        o For network migration

        o For server replacements

        o For device replacements

        o For network software upgrades

        o To automate any tasks that operators/administrator often
          perform

   o System policies intents

Internet-Draft          Intent Classification            November 2019


        o For intent management system policies

        o For design models and policies for network service design

        o For design models and policies for network design

        o For design workflows, models and policies for task based
          intents

   o Intents that affect other intents

        o It may be task based intent that modifies many other intents.

        o The task itself is short-lived, but the modification of other
          intents has an impact on their lifecycle, so those changes
          must continue to be continuously monitored and self-
          corrected/self-optimized.

4. Functional Characteristics and Behavior

   Intent can be used to operate immediately on a target (much like
   issuing a command), or whenever it is appropriate (e.g., in response
   to an event).  In either case, intent has a number of behaviors that
   serve to further organize its purpose, as described by the following
   subsections.

4.1. Persistence

   Intents can be classified into transient/persistent intents:

   o If intent is transient, it has no lifecycle management.  As soon
      as the specified operation is successfully carried out, the
      intent is finished, and can no longer affect the target object.

   o If the intent is persistent, it has lifecycle management.  Once
      the intent is successfully activated and deployed, the system
      will keep all relevant intents active until they are deactivated
      or removed.

4.2. Feedback

   Intent can be classified by whether it is necessary to feedback the
   network information to the intended proponent after the intent is
   executed.





Li, et al.              Expires May 18, 2020                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft          Intent Classification            November 2019


   o For ordinary users, they don't care how the intent is executed,or
      the details of the network. As a result, they don't need to know
      the configuration information of the underlying network. They
      only focus on whether the intent execution result achieves the
      goal, and the execution effect such as the quality of completion
      and the length of execution.

   o For administrators, such as network administrators, they perform
      intents, such as allocating network resources, selecting
      transmission paths, handling network failures, etc. They require
      multiple feedback indicators for network resource conditions,
      congestion conditions, fault conditions, etc. after execution.



4.3. Hierarchy

   In different phases of the autonomous driving network[TMF-auto], the
   intents are different. A typical example of autonomous driving
   network Level 0 to 5 are listed as below.

   o Level 0 - Traditional manual network: O&M personnel manually
      control the network and obtain network alarms and logs. - No
      intent

   o Level 1 - Partially automated network: Automated scripts are used
      to automate service provisioning, network deployment, and
      maintenance. Shallow perception of network status and decision
      making suggestions of machine; - No intent

   o Level 2 - Automated network: Automation of most service
      provisioning, network deployment, and maintenance comprehensive
      perception of network status and local machine decision making;
      - simple intent on service provisioning

   o Level 3 - Self-optimization network: Deep awareness of network
      status and automatic network control, meeting users' network
      intentions. - Intent based on network status cognition

   o Level 4 - Partial autonomous network: In a limited environment,
      people do not need to participate in decision-making and adjust
      themselves. - Intent based on limited AI

   o Level 5 - Autonomous network: In different network environments
      and network conditions, the network can automatically adapt to
      and adjust to meet people's intentions. - Intent based on AI

4.4. Abstracting Intent Operation

   The modeling of Policies can be abstracting using the following
   three-tuple:

      {Context, Capabilities, Constraints}

   Context grounds the policy, and determines if it is relevant or not
   for the current situation.  Capabilities describe the functionality
   that the policy can perform.  Capabilities take different forms,
   depending on the expressivity of the policy as well as the
   programming paradigm(s) used.  Constraints define any restictions on
   the capabilities to be used for that particular context.  Metadata
   can be optionally attached to each of the elements of the three-
   tuple, and may be used to describe how the policy should be used and
   how it operates, as well as prescribe any operational dependencies
   that must be taken into account.  Put another way:

   o Context selects policies based on applicability

   o Capabilities describe the functionality provided by the policy

   o Constraints restrict the capabilities offered and/or the behavior
      of the policy

   Hence, the difference between imperative, declarative, and other
   types of policies lies in how the elements of this three-tuple are
   used according to that particular programming paradigm.  This is how
   [SUPA] was designed: a Policy is a container that aggregates a set
   of tatements.



4.5. Policy Subjects and Policy Targets

   Policy subject is the actor that performs the action specified in
   the policy.  It can be the intent management system which executes
   the policy.  Policy target is a set of managed objects which may be
   affected in the policy enforcement.

4.6. Policy Scope

   Policies used to manage the behavior of objects that they are
   applied to (e.g., the target of the policy).  It is useful to
   differentiate between the following categories of targets:


Li, et al.              Expires May 18, 2020                 [Page 11]

Internet-Draft          Intent Classification            November 2019


   o Policies defined for the Customer or End-User

   o Policies defined for the management system to act on objects in
      the domain that the management system controls

   o Policies defined for the management system to act on objects in
      one or more domains that the management system does not directly
      control

   The different origins and views of these three categories of actors
   lead to the following important differences:

   o Network Knowledge. This area is explored using three exemplary
      actors that have different knowledge of the network:

        o Customers and end-users do not necessarily know the functional
          and operational details of the network that they are using.
          Furthermore, most of the actors in this category lack skills
          to understand such details; in fact, such knowledge is
          typically not relevant to their job. In addition, the network
          may not expose these details to its users. This class of
          actor focuses on the applications that they run, and uses
          services offered by the network.  Hence, they want to specify
          policies that provide consistent behavior according to their
          business needs. They do not have to worry about how the
          policies are deployed onto the underlying network, and
          especially, whether the policies need to be translated to
          different forms to enable network elements to understand
          them.

        o Application developers work in a set of abstractions defined
          by their application and programming environment(s). For
          example, many   application developers think in terms of
          objects (e.g., a VPN).  While this makes sense to the
          application developer, most network devices do not have a VPN
          object per se; rather, the VPN is formed through a set of
          configuration statements for that device in  concert with
          configuration statements for the other devices that
          together make up the VPN. Hence, the view of application
          developers   matches the services provided by the network,
          but may not directly   correspond to other views of other
          actors.

        o Management personnel, such as network Administrators, may have
          the knowledge of the underlying network. However, they may
          not understand the details of the applications and services
          of Customers and End-Users.

   o Automation. Theoricaly, intents from both end-user and management
      system can be automated. In practice, most intents from end-user
      are created manually according to business request. End-users do
      not create or alter intents unless there is change in business.
      Intents from management systems can be created or altered to
      reflect with network policy change. For example, end-users create
      intents to set up paths between hosts, while the management
      system creates an intent to set a global link utilization limit.



5. Intent Classification Table Example

   This chapter proposes the intent classification table approach that
   may help to classify mainstream intent related demos / tools. The
   table was created based on the following:

   o Comments from Chairs that it would be better to have one table
      that would collect all classification info from the text in our
      draft, so that it could be used for easy classification of
      different tools / demos going forward, starting with the ones
      presented at the meeting

   o Categories were initially created solely based on info from this
      draft and expanded based on some discussions during the NMRG 56th
      meeting and some additional categories mentioned during demo
      presentations (e.g. Applications, VNFs, Network Scope)

   This document contains simplified table split into multiple tables.
   The full table would be shared on the web site.

   We first classify intents into intent types and describe each type
   based on the solution it belongs to and what intent user it is for.

   We than present different categories that these intent type can
   belong to, based on intent scope, network scope, intent abstraction
   and lifecycle.

6. The Policy Continuum

   The Policy Continuum defines the set of actors that will create,
   read, use, and manage policy.  Each set of actors has their own
   terminology and concepts that they are familiar with.  This captures
   the fact that business people do not want to use CLI, and network
   operations center personnel do not want to use non-technical
   languages.

7. Involvement of intent in the application of AI to Network Manage
   ment

   In the application of AI to NM, an intent is expected to be, on the
   one hand, a formal definitions of a goal or policy instructed to the
   decision system and, on the other hand, a formal definition of the
   specific actions that some network controller must perform. Goal
   intents and policy intents have different meanings. The former will
   establish an objective for the automated management system to
   accomplish, such as "avoiding latency to be higher than 10 ms".
   Meanwhile, policy intents set the overall regulations and possible
   actions that the AI system can use to achieve those goals. Both goal
   and policy intents are expected to be provided by humans, although
   they must be in some very formal language that can be easily
   understood by computers. All those relations make the degree of
   formality an important dimension to classify intents so that users,
   which here are AI-based agents, can be able to choose the proper
   solution to consume them.

   AI technology has played an important role in the different stages
   of the intent network implementation.

        o Help identify and prevent security threats: Classification
          algorithms can attempt to identify malware or other
          undesirable web content or usage;

        o Intentional translation: use AI algorithm to assist the
          translation module, split translation into the requirements
          contained in the semantics of the intention; automatic
          delivery and execution strategy;Automate tasks and
          appropriate network changes based on the existing network
          infrastructure configuration according to the policy model;

        o Adaptive adjustment: perceive the quality of the user
          experience and perform predictive analysis to proactively
          optimize performance, such as excessive access time;

   To enforce the resulting actions determined by AI-based control
   modules, action intents will have a format that avoids
   misconceptions as much as possible. This means that they will be
   closer to machine language structures than natural (human) language
   structures. This can sacrificing some degree of human
   understandability, so it forms another dimension in the
   classification of intents. This dimension allows automated systems
   to discern which format of intent to use in relation to the
   possibility and degree of humans to be involved in their exchanges.

   Finally, as intents can use different words and languages to refer
   to the same concepts, all intents related to AI will be required to
   follow a specific ontology. This way, input intents will be easily
   semantically translated to formal structures. Output intents will
   also be composed by following the ontology, so receivers of those
   intents will be able to easily understand them.



   For instance, in the intent classification, the machine learning
   algorithm can be utilized to extract the intent feature values and
   classify the intent according to the intent feature distribution.
   For example, using artificial intelligence clustering algorithm, a
   large number of intents proposed by different users are used as
   training data to extract multiple feature dimensions, such as
   vocabulary information intended to be used, related feature
   parameters, context proposed by the intent, and the like.Cluster
   analysis is performed in the same form as the coordinate system, and
   multiple categories are classified according to the characteristics
   of the sample point distribution. For the input intent later, the
   category of the intent is judged based on the  similarity with all
   categories.

        o For specific classification intents, such as safety or fault
          information, conditions can be preset in advance, and once a
          common error message occurs, it will automatically alarm.

        o For the network resource information, set the corresponding
          threshold information. When there is a certain number of link
          users or the network traffic is too large, the adjustment
          intention is started.

        o For users with higher priority, the resources can be
          configured preferentially.
