Internet-Draft       DHCP Geoelement Shapes Option           March 2009

1.  Introduction  

   This document defines the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
   Option [RFC2131] for downloading a location shape to a client, from 
   a server.  This is commonly called Location Configuration 
   Information (LCI).  Servers that provide this information to a 
   client are doing so by communicating via a Location Configuration 
   Protocol, or LCP.

   The DHCP server is assumed to have determined the location from the
   Circuit-ID Relay Agent Information Option (RAIO) defined (as SubOpt
   1) in [RFC3046].  In order to translate the circuit (switch port
   identifier) into a location, the DHCP server is assumed to have
   access to a service that maps the from circuit-ID to the location at
   which the circuit connected to that port terminates in the building,
   for example, the location of the wall jack.  

   Further, the local administrator can have the knowledge that a 
   certain attachment point, for example, is connected to an IEEE 
   802.11 Access Point (AP). Understanding this about the attachment 
   point allows certain location characteristics to be gleaned from 
   this knowledge, such as, by itself, a wireless client can be within 
   100 meters of the location of the AP, therefore a precise location 
   may not be possible, but informing the client it is within a 100 
   meter circle of a given point would be more appropriate.  

   Another example would be if the local administrator has the ability 
   to triangulate the location of the client, and lay this information 
   onto a building map or grid, the local administrator can inform the 
   client that it is in a particular room, instead of giving the client
   the exact coordinates for where it is at this time.  This room would
   most likely best be presented in the form of a polygon (i.e., many 
   sided and enclosed 2D or 3D container).

   This document creates 3 different location shapes, as follows,

   o  a single point - articulated by X and Y coordinates;

   o  a circle - which takes the point X and Y coordinates and extends
      a radius out from that spot;

   o  a polygon - which is a number of x/y coordinate points - greater 
      than 2 - that make up what OpenGIS defines as a Linear Ring
      Ring [OpenGIS].

   The use of the term "point" has been changed in GML from the version
   3.0 specification to the 3.1 specification [OpenGIS].  A point 
   (GML3.0) became a "position" (GML3.1).  For the remainder of this 
   document, we do not distinguish between the two terms. A reader of 
   this document needs to consider these two terms interchangeable 
   here.  



Polk, et al.           Expires September 4, 2009               [Page 3]
Internet-Draft       DHCP Geoelement Shapes Option           March 2009

   In both GML3.0 and GML3.1 (and more recently GML3.2) - a point or 
   position is contained within the feature.xsd schema, which relates 
   directly to what the Presence Information Data Format - Location 
   Object (PIDF-LO), defined in RFC 4119 [RFC4119], mandates support 
   of, but that is all RFC 4119 requires support of as far as GML 
   schemas are concerned.

   A circle is not defined within the feature.xsd schema, but rather 
   the geometryPrimitives.xsd schema in GML 3.1.1.  If this Option were
   used by implementers to place location information in a PIDF-LO, 
   additional support for the geometryPrimitives.xsd schema in GML 
   3.1.1 is necessary.  Section 6 of this document is dedicated to give
   guidance to implementers for just such a conversion from this DHCP 
   Option to a PIDF-LO.

   A polygon is also not defined within the feature.xsd schema, and is 
   also defined in the geometryPrimitives.xsd schema in GML 3.1.1. 
   Therefore, just as converting a circle from this Option into a 
   PIDF-LO requires the geometryPrimitives.xsd schema, so too does a 
   polygon representation in a PIDF-LO.

   Additional location shapes can be defined by extending this 
   Specification, and can require the geometryPrimitives.xsd schema be 
   implemented, or another GML schema.  

   This Option has limited applicability to certain environments, such 
   as cellular networks. 

   One shape defined in this document overlaps with [RFC3825], which 
   includes a mechanism for transporting a geo point.  In support of 
   backward compatibility, this document leaves [RFC3825] alone. 
   Implementers will have the choice to use this new option or continue
   to support [RFC3825].  By leaving [RFC3825] alone, implementations 
   based on [RFC3825] will not be affected by this new option.


2.  Format of the DHCP Geoelement Shapes Option

2.1 Overall Format of Shapes Option in IPv4

   This section defines this DHCP Option for use in IPv4.  The first 4 
   bytes of this Option has the same format, regardless of the shape 
   contained in the Option.  The fields that follow are where the 
   Option deviates based on the type of location shape being expressed 
   (i.e., a point, a circle or a polygon).  Figure 1, below, shows the 
   first 4 bytes of each shape for IPv4.  Each field is defined below 
   Figure 1 for any shape of this Option.  The 4-bit shape field in 
   this Option will be detailed in section 3, describing each of the 3 
   shapes introduced by this document.

3.  Geo-element Format for both IPv4 and IPv6

   The Geo-elements, in both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6, have the following 
   format:

    Figure 3. Geo-element Format for both IPv4 and IPv6


      Geotype:   A one-byte identifier of the data location value.

Internet-Draft       DHCP Geoelement Shapes Option           March 2009


      Geolength: The length, in bytes, of the Geovalue, not including 
                 the Geolength field itself, up to a maximum of 255 
                 bytes.

      Geovalue:  The location shape value, as described in detail 
                 below.  The Geovalue is always in UTP-8.

   The Geotypes this document defines (and IANA registers) for a point 
   are:

      Geotype=1  X-coordinate - this necessitates there be a 
                 Latitude Geovalue present.

      Geotype=2  Y-coordinate - this necessitates there be a 
                 Longitude Geovalue present.

      Geotype=3  Z-coordinate - this necessitates there be an
                 Altitude Geovalue present.

      Geotype=4  Unit of Measurement Altitude (UofMA) - this 
                 necessitates there be an Altitude unit of measurement 
                 Geovalue present.

   The first byte of the Geovalue for Geotypes =1 and =2 MUST be a 
   plus '+' or minus '-' sign byte, indicating:

      For Geotype=1 - whether the latitude is positive (above the 
                      equator) or negative (below the equator).

      For Geotype=2 - whether the longitude is positive (East of the 
                      prime meridian of the datum used) or negative 
                      (West of the prime meridian of the datum used).

   This document defines (and IANA registers) 2 Altitude units of 
   measurement (Geotype=4). 

     Geotype=4, Geovalue=1 - meters above or below the datum 0 plane.  

     Geotype=4, Geovalue=2 - building floor.  

   When Geotype=4 (UofMA) has a Geovalue=2 (building floor), the 
   Geovalue for Geotype=3 (Z-coordinate) is alpha characters, meaning 
   there is no need to include a plus '+' or minus '-' sign byte (more 
   on this below table 2).

   When Geotype=4 (UofMA) has a Geovalue=1 (meters), first byte of the 
   Geovalue=3 MUST be a plus '+' or minus '-' sign byte, indicating:

      For Geotype=3 - whether the altitude Geovalue is positive (above 
                      datum 0) or negative (below datum 0).

   +---------+--------------------------------------------------------+

   Table 2. Unit of Measurement for the Altitude value


   The Unit of Measurement Altitude (UofMA) field in this Option will 
   define what is considered the 3-Dimensional 0 (zero) altitude. For 
   example, it could be the ground, Mean-lowest-Low-tide or 
   Mean-Tide level at a given X/Y coordinate.

   The 'floor', Geovalue=2, SHOULD match the locally significant 
   description for identifying floors in a multi-floor building.  
   Values for this option would include '1' or '2' and could include 
   'basement' or 'mezzanine' or any other floor identifier determined 
   by local administration.

   For example, for a Geotype=4 (UofMA), the Geovalue in Geotype=3 
   (Z-Coordinate) would be 'basement' or 'mezzanine', either spelled 
   out.  

   For any point, there MUST be a Geotype=1 (X-coordinate) and
   Geotype=2 (Y-coordinate) present.  Geotype=3 (Z-coordinate) and 
   Geotype=4 (UofMA) MUST be implemented to comply with this 
   specification, but are OPTIONAL to use for any given communication. 
   That said, if there is an altitude provide (Geotype=3), there MUST 
   be a (Geotype=4) present as well.

   If the DHCP Option size becomes an issue (i.e., longer than 255

   bytes), it is allowed to use the long Options capability created in 
   RFC 3396 [RFC3396] to solve for this.

   New Geotypes and Geovalues MUST be defined in an RFC, following 
   expert review.


3.1 The Geoelement Shape for a 2D/3D Point

   The elements defined in Section 3 define how to communicate a 
   point (shape=1). These additional rules need to be followed for a 
   point:

   o  There MUST NOT be more than one Geotype=3 (Z-coordinate) or 
      more than one Geotype=4 (UofMA) within this Option when 
      shape=1.

   o  These are the Geotypes that MUST be present for a 2D point within
      this Option:

      o  Geotype=1  (X-Coordinate (Latitude))
      o  Geotype=2  (Y-Coordinate (Longitude))

   o  These are the Geotypes that MUST NOT be present for a 2D point 
      within this Option:

3.2 The Geoelement Shape for a 2D/3D Circle

   The elements defined in section 3.1 define how to communicate a 
   point (shape=1).  The additional element needed to communicate a 
   circle (shape=2) is a radius Geotype. The a unit of measurement of 
   for the radius (UofMR) is always meters, therefore, there does not 
   need to be a separate value for this - having only one to choose 
   from.

      Geotype=5  Radius - the straight line from the point at the 
                 center of the circle, extending out a given distance 
                 (this is the Geovalue of the Radius Geotype).

   +---------+----------------------------------+---------+
   | Geotype | Geoelement                       | PIDF-LO |

   +---------+----------------------------------+---------+

   Table 3. Required Radius Geoelement Information


   When the Option communicates a circle (shape=2), the following 
   Geotype MUST be present in the Option:

      Geotype=1 (the X-coordinate representing the center of the 
                 circle)
      Geotype=2 (the Y-coordinate representing the center of the 
                 circle)
      Geotype=5 (the Radius value from the center X/Y point of the 
                 circle)

   An altitude (Geotypes 3 & 4) coordinate is OPTIONAL, but both 
   Geotypes MUST appear in the Option if either appears for shape=2 (a 
   circle).

   Geotypes=7 through =10, which detail a Centerpoint (see Section 3.3 
   below) MUST NOT appear in a shape=2 (circle) Option.  There is 
   already an implicit centerpoint of the circle, and that is the one 
   X/Y point in the Option.

   The following additional rules need to be followed for a circle:

   o  There MUST NOT be more than one Geotype=3 (Z-coordinate) or

      more than one Geotype=4 (UofMA) within this Option when 
      shape=2.

      within this Option:

3.3 The Geoelement Shape for a 2D/3D Polygon  

   The elements defined in this section define how to communicate a 
   polygon (shape=3).  A polygon is a series of X/Y coordinate points, 
   or X/Y/Z coordinate groupings.  There MUST be at least 4 points to 
   shape a polygon (which would result in a triangle), to be consistent 


Polk, et al.           Expires September 4, 2009              [Page 11]
Internet-Draft       DHCP Geoelement Shapes Option           March 2009

   with the GML 3.1 specification [OpenGIS].  A minimum of 4 Points 
   make up a polygon in GML because the first and last point in a 
   polygon are the same, i.e., the first point is repeated to indicate 
   the representation has completed (or circled).  There can be more 
   points included in the polygon.

   There is one additional Geo-element that MUST be present in shape=3 
   (polygon) of this Option, and that is an indication of the number of
   points in the polygon.  Geotypes=1 and =2 create an X/Y 
   point. 

      Geotype=6  # of Points - each point, in 2D, is a point of X and
                              Y coordinates.

   If a 3rd dimension exists for a point, Geotype=3 (the Z-coordinate) 
   is added to Geotype=1 and =2.    

   +---------+----------------------------------+---------+
   | Geotype | Geoelement                       | PIDF-LO |
   +---------+----------------------------------+---------+
   |    6    |  # of Points                     |   N/A   |
   +---------+----------------------------------+---------+

   Table 4. Required Number of Points within "this" Polygon

   For shape=3 (polygon), the Geotype=6 MUST be the first element in 
   the Option -- as this will indicate how many points 
   (respectively) there are in the Option; thus giving the remaining 
   length of the Option from a number of Geo-elements point of view.

   When this Option indicates it contains a polygon (shape=3), 
   coordinate points or 3D combinations (X, Y and Z coordinates 
   describing a 3D point) MUST have a specific order or grouping of 
   Geotype elements. The order is this:

   For 2D points, this Option MUST have this point order:

      Geotype=6, Geotype=1, Geotype=2, Geotype=1, Geotype=2, Geotype=1,
      Geotype=2, etc...

   for however many coordinate points are in the polygon. In other 
   words, the "# of Points" indicator is indicated first, followed by 
   at least 3 sets of points:

      (# of Points), (x/y), (x/y), (x/y) (more if there are more 2D 
      points in the polygon)

   For 3D Points, this Option MUST have this point order:


      Geotype=6, Geotype=1, Geotype=2, Geotype=3, Geotype=4, 
      Geotype=1, Geotype=2, etc ...

Internet-Draft       DHCP Geoelement Shapes Option           March 2009


   for however many coordinate points are in the polygon. In other 
   words, the "# of Points" is indicated first, followed by at least 3
   sets of points:

      (# of Points), (x/y/z), (x/y/z), (x/y/z) (more if there are 
      more 3D points in the polygon)

   This Option does not repeat the first and last points as GML 
   mandates for a Linear Ring representation of a polygon in XML.  That
   function is part of the conversion from this Option to a PIDF-LO, 
   which is described in section 5 of this document. Thus, is not part 
   of DHCP operation/communication.

   Any polygon can contain an OPTIONAL Centerpoint Geo-element, which 
   is identified by the following Geotypes: 

      Geotype=7  Polygon Centerpoint X-Coordinate - server calculated
                 center point X-Coordinate within a supplied polygon.

      Geotype=8  Polygon Centerpoint Y-Coordinate - server calculated
                 center point X-Coordinate within a supplied polygon.

      Geotype=9 Polygon Centerpoint Z-Coordinate - server calculated
                 center point X-Coordinate within a supplied polygon.

      Geotype=10 Polygon Centerpoint Unit of Measurement Altitude - 
                 this is the same as the (UofMA) for Geotype=4 (from 
                 section 3.1).

   The DHCP server, or an application on another server, calculates 
   this point (in 2D or 3D), and provides this via this Option to the 
   client. The client does not perform this calculation or formatting 
   of this centerpoint information other than to pass it on whenever it
   wants. The Location Recipient MUST NOT assume the Location Target is
   at the centerpoint.  This information can be used by applications - 
   making it valuable in some situations.

   Geotypes=7 through =10 MUST NOT appear in a shape=2 (circle) Option.
   There is already an implicit centerpoint of the circle, and that is 
   the one X/Y(/Z) point provided to the client in the Option.

   Table 5. Centerpoint Geotypes


   If there is a centerpoint contained in the Option (of a polygon), it
   has its own order of Geotypes, which is as follows:

       Geotype=7, Geotype=8, Geotype=9, Geotype=10

   There are no additional Geotypes involved with centerpoint.  So this
   looks like the following:

      center-x, center-y (and optionally) center-z, center-UofMA

   This order above MUST NOT be altered, and MUST be the last 2D or 3D 
   point of (shape=3) polygon Geo-elements. It is its own separate 
   point.

   There MUST NOT be more than 1 altitude Geotype within this Option, 
   unless each coordinate point in the polygon is a 3D point.  In other
   words, if there is an altitude (Geotype=3) -- the rule is every 
   point is in 3D, or only one of them is in 3D.  If none of points are
   in 3D, then the centerpoint can have the only altitude (Geotype=3). 
   If one of the polygon points is in 3D, the centerpoint MUST NOT have
   an altitude (Geotype=3).

   It is RECOMMENDED that if there is a centerpoint within this Option,
   the centerpoint is the one point that includes the altitude for the 
   Option.  

      [EDITOR'S NOTE: do we want to allow both 2D & 3D points in the 
                      same polygon? Right now, the answer is "not 
                      allowed" - because this would make everything 
                      much more complicated.]

   The following additional rules need to be followed for a polygon:

   o  There MUST NOT be more than one Geotype=3 (Z-coordinate) or 
      more than one Geotype=4 (UofMA) within this Option when 
      shape=3.

   o  If the Centerpoint does not include altitude (Geotype=3), or if 
      there is no Centerpoint, and one point of a polygon is defined as
      3D - it is REQUIRED (with one exception) the remaining points are
      defined as 2D, it is assumed the remaining points are at the same
      altitude as the point that has the altitude (Geotype=3) for that 
      Option.

   The exception to the above rule is when all points include altitude

   (Geotype=3).  In other words, it is an 'only one has it (altitude), 
   or they all have it' rule.  

   o  These are the Geotypes that MUST be present for a 2D polygon 
      within this Option:

      o  Geotype=1  (X-Coordinate (Latitude))
      o  Geotype=2  (Y-Coordinate (Longitude))
      o  Geotype=6  (# of Points)

   The shape=3 (polygon) Option MUST contain at least 3 points to be a 
   Polygon in this Option (conversion from this Option to a PIDF-LO is 
   done by the client, and is described in section 5 of this document).
   See earlier in this section for the order rules around more than 
   one Geotype=1 and =2 (and the centerpoint, if present).

   o  These are the Geotypes that are OPTIONAL for a 2D polygon 
      within this Option:

      o  Geotype=7  (Centerpoint X-Coordinate (Lat))
      o  Geotype=8  (Centerpoint Y-Coordinate (Long))

   o  These are the Geotypes that MUST NOT be present for a 2D polygon 
      within this Option:

      o  Geotype=3  (Z-Coordinate (Altitude))
      o  Geotype=4  (Unit of Measurement Altitude)
      o  Geotype=5  (Radius)
      o  Geotype=9  (Centerpoint Z-Coordinate (Alt))
      o  Geotype=10 (Centerpoint Unit of Measurement Altitude)

      o  Geotype=3  (Z-Coordinate (Altitude))
      o  Geotype=4  (Unit of Measurement Altitude)

   or

      o  Geotype=9  (Centerpoint Z-Coordinate (Alt))
      o  Geotype=10 (Centerpoint Unit of Measurement Altitude)

   Each UofMA Geotype (=4 and =10) MUST be the same Geovalue,

   regardless of how many altitudes are in the Option for shape=3 
   (polygon). 

   Geotype=9 and =10 MUST NOT be present without the corresponding 
   Geotypes=7 and =8.  

   To reduce complexity, it is RECOMMENDED that all altitudes - when 
   all points are in 3D - be the same value (i.e., parallel to the 
   ground).

   The shape=3 (polygon) Option MUST contain at least 3 points to be a 
   polygon.  See earlier in this section for the order rules around 
   more than one Geotype=1, =2 and =3 point set.

      o  Geotype=9  (Centerpoint Z-Coordinate (Alt))
      o  Geotype=10 (Centerpoint Unit of Measurement Altitude)

   o  This Geotype MUST NOT be present for a 3D polygon within this 
      Option:

      o  Geotype=5  (Radius)

   Geotypes=11 (Datum) and =12 (Valid-for) are OPTIONAL in either a 2D 
   or 3D polygon, but MAY change in future extension(s) to this 
   document.


3.4 Additional Optional Geotypes

   The following Geotypes are OPTIONAL:

   Geotype=11 Datum - the base line of reference from which 
              measurements are taken out from (here both horizontally 
              and vertically).

   When not present, WGS84 2D or 3D (EPSG 4326 and 4979 respectively) 
   MUST be assumed.  This Geotype indicates another Datum is assigned 
   to all coordinate Geotypes in Option (meaning each X-coordinate, 
   Y-coordinate, Z-coordinate, including Centerpoint coordinates).  The
   WGS84 datum can be made explicit, but including this Geotype=11, 
   Geovalue=1; two other datum combinations are included here.

   This document establishes the following alternate (to WGS84) datums:




Polk, et al.           Expires September 4, 2009              [Page 16]
Internet-Draft       DHCP Geoelement Shapes Option           March 2009

   Datum = 1 denotes WGS84 (EPSG4326) for 2D, and (EPSG4979) for 3D 
           (depending on whether an altitude Geotype is present).

   Datum = 2 denotes the horizontal datum NAD83 as defined by the EPSG 
           as their CRS Code 4269; North American Vertical Datum of 
           1988 (NAVD88) is the associated vertical datum for NAD83

   Datum = 3 denotes the vertical datum NAD83 as defined by the EPSG as
           their CRS Code 4269; Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) is the
           associated vertical datum for NAD83

   Each of the above is IANA registered.

   Geotype=12 Valid-for - measured in seconds the location within this 
              Option is to be considered good, before needing a 
              refresh, which maps to PIDF.  

   If Valid-for is not present, the Geoelement shape Option is valid 
   until the whole Option lease has expired.


   This timer MUST start when the Option is received by the Client.

   Table 6. List of Additional non-grouped Geotypes

   Geotypes 14 - 255 are reserved.

   NOTE: the authors are open to including both the Confidence and/or 
         Uncertainty Geotypes if the WG can reasonably provide valid 
         use-cases, as well as industry accepted definitions.  
         Currently, the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), as 
         one source, is ambiguous about either of these fields, 
         including lacking a good definition for either.


4.  Versioning this Option

   It is RECOMMENDED that new shapes (until this Option exceeds 16) not
   necessitate a new version of this Option.  A new version SHOULD only
   be necessary if one of the shapes requires a change in the format of
   the fields within the Option.  If one or more shapes need altering, 
   the remaining shapes SHOULD carry forward into the new version of 
   this Option. This ensures backwards compatibility with as large an

   installed base as possible.


5.  Recommendations for Converting this Option into a PIDF-LO

   The following table is how this DHCP Geoelement shapes Option maps 
   into a PIDF-LO.  Currently, not every Geoelement maps properly into 
   the PIDF-LO.  Those mappings are for another effort.


5.1 X-, Y- and Z-Coordinate placement in the PIDF-LO

   The following 2D XML element is where the X-, Y-coordinates go into 
   the PIDF-LO:

      <gp:location-info>
         <gml:Point srsName="urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326">
            <gml:pos>32 -86</gml:pos>
         </gml:Point>
      </gp:location-info>

   The following 3D XML element is where the X-, Y-, Z-coordinates go 
   into the PIDF-LO:

      <gp:location-info>
         <gml:Point srsName="urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4979">
            <gml:pos>32 -86 10</gml:pos>
         </gml:Point>
      </gp:location-info>


5.2 Unit of Measurement Altitude (UofMA) in the PIDF-LO

   GML expects altitude (Geotype=3) to be in meters only.  This is not 
   possible today because the need express altitude in floors.  This 
   results in the following ways of expressing the Z-coordinate 
   (altitude):

   - if Z-coordinate (Geotype=3) is given in floors  (Geotype=4, 
     Geovalue=3), the client determines that the PIDF-LO needs place 
     the altitude value into the <cl:FLR> element.

   - if Z-coordinate (Geotype=3) is given in meters (Geotype=4, 
     Geovalue=1), the client has two options:

     Choice#1 - placing the altitude value into the same <gml:pos> 
                element that Lat and Long go;

     Choice#2 - shown this way

   [Editor's Note: if this solution is chosen, then one of the two 
                   Choices above for altitude placement needs to be
                   mandatory to implement, with the other being 
                   optional.]


5.3  A Circle expressed within the PIDF-LO

   The Shape=2 part of this DHCP Option is shown at the beginning of 
   the XML as <gml: Circle ...>. The schema for a circle is defined in 
   [GeoShape].

   The following is where Geotype=5 fits into the PIDF-LO, as described 
   in the GML3.1 specification here [OpenGIS]:

   <gml:Circle srsName="urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326" 
                xmlns:gml="http://www.opengis.net/gml"> 
      <gp:location-info>
        <gs:Circle srsName="urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326">
          <gml:pos>32.51 -86.51</gml:pos>
          <gs:radius uom="urn:ogc:def:uom:EPSG::9001">
            33
          </gs:radius>
        </gs:Circle>
      </gp:location-info>


5.4 A Polygon placement within a PIDF-LO

   The Shape=3 part of this DHCP Option is shown at the beginning of 
   the XML as <gml: polygon ...>. As stated earlier, a polygon has to 
   have at least 4 linear ring points within it.  Also stated earlier, 
   if there is a 3rd dimension, there can only be one altitude value, 
   or every point has to have the same altitude value. This is to 
   reduce complexity.

   The XML for a circle is defined in [GeoShape].

5.5 Centerpoint X-, Y- and Z-Coordinate placement in the PIDF-LO

   TBD

   GML does not specify XML for a centerpoint of a polygon.


5.6 Centerpoint Unit of Measurement Altitude (CUofMA) placement in the 
    PIDF-LO

   TBD

   GML does not specify XML for a centerpoint of a polygon.


5.7 Datum placement in the PIDF-LO

   At issue here is that GML specifically assumes WGS84 2D or 3D to be 
   the datum, therefore a datum element is not present for the PIDF-LO.
   For points, circles and polygons using the WGS84 datum, each 
   accomplishes this identification with the use of 

      srsName="urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326" for 2D representations, and

      srsName="urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4979" for 3D representations.

   Unfortunately, WGS84 is a goal for many (all?) systems; one in which
   some have not achieved yet.  Some systems believe it might be 
   decades before they are converted over to the WGS84 datum.  




Polk, et al.           Expires September 4, 2009              [Page 20]
Internet-Draft       DHCP Geoelement Shapes Option           March 2009

   For a 2D or 3D non-WGS84 datum, this is the XML schema from 
   [OpenGIS]:

   <element name="GeographicCRS" type="gml:GeographicCRSType"
    substitutionGroup="gml:_CoordinateReferenceSystem"/>

   <complexType name="GeographicCRSType">
      <complexContent>
         <extension base="gml:AbstractCoordinateReferenceSystemType">
            <sequence>
              <element ref="gml:usesEllipsoidalCS"/>
              <element ref="gml:usesGeodeticDatum"/>
            </sequence>
         </extension>
      </complexContent>
   </complexType>

   For 1D Vertical only coordinate reference system utilized for 
   heights and depths, where WGS84 2D is used horizontally, the 
   following schema from [OpenGIS] is this:

   <element name="VerticalCRS" type="gml:VerticalCRSType"
    substitutionGroup="gml:_CoordinateReferenceSystem"/>

   <complexType name="VerticalCRSType">
      <complexContent>
         <extension base="gml:AbstractCoordinateReferenceSystemType">
            <sequence>
               <element ref="gml:usesVerticalCS"/>
               <element ref="gml:usesVerticalDatum"/>
            </sequence>
         </extension>
      </complexContent>
   </complexType>


5.8 Valid-for placement in the PIDF-LO

   TBD

   (this is likely part of the PIDF specification)

7.7 Datums Registered by this Document

   This document IANA registers the following Datums to be used by the 
   Geotype=11 (Datum). If no Geotype=11 is present in this Option, it 
   the default datum will be either EPSG-4326 for 2D, and EPSG-4979 for 
   3D.

   Datum = 1 denotes WGS84 (EPSG4326) for 2D, and (EPSG4979) for 3D 
           (depending on whether an altitude Geotype is present).

   Datum = 2 denotes the horizontal datum NAD83 as defined by the EPSG 
           as their CRS Code 4269; North American Vertical Datum of 
           1988 (NAVD88) is the associated vertical datum for NAD83

   Datum = 3 denotes the vertical datum NAD83 as defined by the EPSG as
           their CRS Code 4269; Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) is the
           associated vertical datum for NAD83
