          2.  Abstract

          This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
          (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the
          Internet community.  In particular, it describes objects used
          for managing ATM-based interfaces, devices, networks and
          services in addition to those defined in the ATM MIB
          [RFC2515], to provide support for the management of on-demand
          ATM Loopback Tests.


          3.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

          The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
          components:

              o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571
                  [RFC2571].

              o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and
                  events for the purpose of management. The first
                  version of this Structure of Management Information
                  (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, RFC
                  1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC
                  1215 [RFC1215]. The second version, called SMIv2, is
                  described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], RFC 2579
                  [RFC2579] and RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

              o   Message protocols for transferring management
                  information. The first version of the SNMP message
                  protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC
                  1157 [RFC1157]. A second version of the SNMP message
                  protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
                  protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
                  [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906]. The third version of
                  the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in
                  RFC 1906 [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574
                  [RFC2574].

          Internet-Draft         ATM Test Objects      November 28, 1999


              o   Protocol operations for accessing management
                  information. The first set of protocol operations and
                  associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC
                  1157 [RFC1157]. A second set of protocol operations
                  and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
                  [RFC1905].

              o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC
                  2573 [RFC2573] and the view-based access control
                  mechanism described in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

                  A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP
                  Management Framework can be found in RFC 2570
                  [RFC2570].

                  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information
                  store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
                  Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms
                  defined in the SMI.

                  This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to
                  the SMIv2. A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be
                  produced through the appropriate translations. The
                  resulting translated MIB must be semantically
                  equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted
                  because no translation is possible (use of Counter64).
                  Some machine readable information in SMIv2 will be
                  converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during
                  the translation process. However, this loss of machine
                  readable information is not considered to change the
                  semantics of the MIB.

          4.  Overview

          The purpose of this memo is to provide additional
          capabilities, not found in the ATM MIB [RFC2515], which are
          needed to manage ATM interfaces.  This memo addresses ATM
          Testing Support and must be used in conjunction with the
          System/Interface Test MIB [TestMIB].


          4.1.  Background

          In addition to the MIB module defined in this memo, other MIB
          modules are necessary to manage ATM interfaces, links and
          cross-connects.  Examples include MIB II for general system
          [RFC1213] and interface management [RFC2233], the DS3 or
          SONET/SDH MIBs for management of SONET/SDH and DS3 physical
          interfaces, and, as appropriate, MIB modules for applications
          that make use of ATM, such as SMDS and LAN Emulation.  These
          MIB modules are outside the scope of this specification.

          This MIB module requires the use of the ATM MIB module defined
          in [RFC2515] and the System/Interface Test MIB module
          [TestMIB].

          This memo defines extensions to the ATM MIB in order to
          support ATM Loopback Tests. An ATM Loopback Test provides the
          ability to send out a loopback OAM (Operations and
          Maintenance) cell to verify the existence of connectivity for
          a particular connection.

          4.2.  Terminology

          The following terms are defined here and used throughout this
          MIB:
               - Virtual Path Link (VPL)
               - Virtual Path Connection (VPC)
               - Virtual Path Segment (VP Segment)
               - Virtual Channel Link (VCL)
               - Virtual Channel Connection (VCC)
               - Virtual Channel Segment (VC Segment).

          4.3.  Supported Functions

          The managed ATM objects are organized as follows:

                (1) ATM Loopback Testing
                (2) ATM End-Point Tables

          4.3.1.  ATM Loopback Testing

          The loopback test provides the ability to send out a loopback
          OAM cell to verify the existence of connectivity for a
          particular connection.  Loopback tests can be performed on
          either an entire connection (i.e., an end-to-end test), a
          segment of the connection (i.e., a segment test), a portion of
          a segment (i.e., a loopback location identifier test), or the
          network portion of a connection (i.e., a service internal
          test).

          The loopback test makes use of the Test Table defined in
          [TestMIB].  For a given interface, a loopback test can be
          invoked by obtaining ownership of a test and then by setting
          the value of testType equal to one of the ATM Loopback Test
          Types defined in Section 5. See procedures in [TestMIB] for

          using the Test Table.  After invoking a loopback test, the
          object testResult can be read to determine the outcome of the
          loopback test (e.g., 'success(2)' if the loopback cell made it
          back to the originator of the test or 'failed(7)' if the
          loopback cell did not make it back).

          The following types of loopback tests are defined:

               - End-to-end Loopback Test
               - Segment Loopback Test
               - Loopback Test Using Loopback Location Identifier
               - Network Loopback Test.


          1) End-to-end Loopback Test

          The end-to-end loopback (LB) is self-explanatory.  For a VP
          test, the cell is sent on the given VP, via VCI=4 specified in
          [UNI3.1].  For a VC test, the LB cell is sent on the VC under
          test, with the PTI (Payload Type Indicator) set to 5 as
          specified in [UNI3.1].  Figure 3 illustrates the end-to-end
          loopback test.

          See Section 5 for more details on how to use the End-to-end
          Loopback Test.


          2) Segment Loopback Test

          The segment LB test is explained in ITU-T I.610[I.610]. For a
          VP segment test, the LB cell is sent on the VP under test via
          VCI=3 as specified in [UNI3.1], and the Loopback Location ID
          field is set to all 1's.  For a VC segment test, the LB cell
          is sent on the VC under test, with the PTI set to 4 as





          Expires May 28, 2000                                  [Page 7]






          Internet-Draft         ATM Test Objects      November 28, 1999


          specified in [UNI3.1], and the Loopback Location ID field is
          set to all 1's.

          This test involves a LB cell being inserted at a pre-defined
          segment end-point, and looped back at the corresponding
          segment end-point encountered.  The pair of segment end-points
          define a segment (which is used for the segment loopback
          test).  A VP/VC connection can have multiple segments, but
          multiple segments cannot overlap.

          A UNI interface is by definition defined as a segment end-
          point (hence a UNI would be considered a segment).  A segment
          can also define:
               - a B-ICI
               - a public carrier's 'piece' of the connection
               - a private network's 'piece' of the connection.


          In order to support this functionality, the VP/VC link
          termination needs to be able to be defined as a segment.  This
          can be done using either the atmVplSegmentEndPoint or
          atmVclSegmentEndPoint object depending on whether it is for a
          VPC or VCC.  A segment loopback test is illustrated in Figure
          4.

          3) Loopback Test Using Loopback Location Identifier

          This loopback test is a special type of 2) where the Loopback
          Location ID field is set to a value that corresponds to a
          specific node in a given network (Note that the format of this
          field is not standardized, that is, the value is significant
          only within an administrative domain).  In this case, the
          device initiating the LB test inserts the appropriate Loop

          Back Location ID.  When the LB cell reaches the corresponding
          device, that device recognizes the Loopback Location ID as its
          own, and loops it back.  This test is useful for performing
          fault sectionalization without having to provision segment
          end-points.  An additional object, the atmIfLogicalLoopbackId,
          is defined to determine the loopback point.  Figure 5 shows a
          loopback test using a location identifier. Note that the
          loopback test using location identifier can be used to perform
          a loopback test over a portion of a defined segment.  See
          Figure 5.

          4) Network Loopback Test

          This is a loopback test that the manager requests an agent in
          a network to perform over the internal portion of a designated
          connection.  The Network then initiates the internal network
          loopback test by inserting an OAM loopback cell at one of the
          end-points of the internal network portion of the connection.
          When the loopback cell reaches the other end-point of the
          internal Network , the cell is looped back.  This test is
          useful for verifying connectivity through a particular

          4.3.2.  ATM End-Point Tables

          There are two ATM End-point tables: the ATM VP End-point Table
          and the ATM VC End-point Table. The ATM VP End-point Table
          augments the atmVplTable and defines the
          atmVplEndptSegmentEndPoint object to represent whether or not
          a specified VPL is a segment end-point. Similarly for Virtual
          Channels, the ATM VC End-point Table and the
          atmVclEndptSegmentEndPoint object are used to represent
          whether or not a specified VCL is a segment end-point.

                  if the loopback OAM cell returns to the originating
                  end-point within 5 seconds, otherwise, the test fails.

                  The manager-station performs a loopback test by making
                  use of the testTable defined in [TestMIB].  In order
                  to run this test the object testType in the testTable
                  shall be set to atmLoopbackVpE2e, and the object

                  [TestMIB] corresponding to the VP designated for the
                  test.

                  Before starting a test, a manager-station must first
                  obtain 'ownership' of the entry in the testTable for
                  the interface to be tested (follow procedure defined
                  in [TestMIB]).  Once the manager-station obtains
                  ownership, a loopback test for a given interface can
                  be invoked by first setting up parameters necessary
                  for the loopback test (e.g., set the testTarget), and
                  then setting the value of testType in the testTable
                  equal to 'atmLoopbackVpE2e'. The testRowStatus is used
                  to invoke the atmLoopbackVpE2e test on the VP with the
                  VPI corresponding to the testTarget.

                  After invoking a loopback test, wait for the test
                  completion by polling for the object testResult.  A
                  value of 'inProgress(3)' will result if the test is
                  still in progress.  Once the test is completed, the
                  object testResult will have a value of 'success(2)' if
                  the loopback OAM cell returned to the originator of
                  the test within 5 seconds, if not, a value of
                  'failed(7)' will result.  If the ATM system does not
                  support this type of loopback test, then a value of

               DESCRIPTION
                 "This is a loopback test performed on a designated
                 segment of a VP (Virtual Path).  To perform this test a
                 segment OAM cell is inserted at one of the segment
                 end-points of the designated VP connection (e.g., at a
                 host) via VCI=3 (the VCI used for VP OAM segment
                 cells), travels across the segment on the designated VP
                 to the device pre-configured as the corresponding
                 segment end-point, and then loops back to the
                 originating segment end-point on the designated VP.
                 Success is achieved if the loopback OAM cell returns to
                 the originating end-point within 5 seconds, otherwise,
                 the test fails.

                 In order to use the atmLoopbackVpSegment test, a
                 segment must be defined by setting up segment end-
                 points using the atmVplEndptSegmentEndPoint object from
                 the atmVplEndptTable.  The atmVplEndptSegmentEndPoint
                 is set to 'isaVpSegmentEndPoint(1)' for each segment
                 end-point.  Note that this object is by default set to
                 'isaVpSegmentEndPoint(1)' if the atmVplTable supports
                 one end of a UNI.  In such a case, a UNI VP loopback
                 test would be achieved when the atmLoopbackVpSegment
                 test was initiated over the UNI.

                 The manager-station performs a loopback test by making
                 use of the testTable defined in [TestMIB].  In order to

                 segment of a VC (Virtual Channel).  To perform this
                 test a segment OAM cell is inserted at one of the
                 segment end-points of the designated VC connection
                 (e.g., at a host) via PTI=4 (the PTI value used for VC
                 OAM segment cells), travels across the segment on the
                 designated VC to the device pre-configured as the
                 corresponding segment end-point, and then loops back to
                 the originating segment end-point on the designated VC.
                 Success is achieved if the loopback OAM cell returns to
                 the originating end-point within 5 seconds, otherwise,
                 the test fails.

                 In order to use the atmLoopbackVcSegment test, a
                 segment must be defined by setting up segment end-
                 points using the atmVclEndptSegmentEndPoint object from
                 the atmVclEndptTable.  The atmVclEndptSegmentEndPoint
                 is set to 'isaVcSegmentEndPoint(1)' for each segment
                 end-point.  Note that this object is by default set to
                 'isaVcSegmentEndPoint(1)' if the atmVclTable supports
                 one end of a UNI.  In such a case, a UNI VC loopback

                 OAM cell returns to the originating internal network
                 segment end-point within 5 seconds, otherwise, the test
                 fails.

                 The manager-station performs a loopback test by making
                 use of the testTable defined in [TestMIB].  In order to
                 run this test the object testType in the testTable
                 shall be set to atmLoopbackVcServiceInternal, and the
                 object testTarget points to the row in the
                 atmVcCrossConnectTable in [RFC2515] corresponding to
                 the VC designated for the test.

                 Before starting a test, a manager-station must first
                 obtain 'ownership' of the entry in the testTable for
                 the interface to be tested (follow procedure defined in
                 [TestMIB]).  Once the manager-station obtains
                 ownership, a loopback test for a given interface can be
                 invoked by first setting up parameters necessary for
                 the loopback test (e.g., set the testTarget), and then
                 setting the value of testType in the testTable equal to
                 'atmLoopbackVcServiceInternal'. The testRowStatus is
                 used to invoke the atmLoopbackVcServiceInternal test on
                 the VC crossconnect with the ingress and egress VPI/VCI
                 values corresponding to the testTarget.

                 After invoking a loopback test, wait for the test
                 completion by polling for the object testResult.  A
                 value of 'inProgress(3)' will result if the test is
                 still in progress.  Once the test is completed, the
                 object testResult will have a value of 'success(2)' if
                 the loopback OAM cell returned to the originator of the
                 test within 5 seconds, if not, a value of 'failed(7)'
                 will result.  If the ATM system does not support this
                 type of loopback test, then a value of
                 'notSupported(4)' will be provided.  Other possible
                 values for the testResult object are 'unAbleToRun(5)'
                 and 'aborted(6)'."

          6.  Security Considerations

          There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB
          that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-
          create.  Such objects may be considered sensitive or
          vulnerable in some network environments. The support for SET
          operations in a non-secure environment without proper
          protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

          The managed objects in this MIB contain sensitive information
          since, collectively, they allow the invocation of tests on the
          managed device.

          This MIB contains objects which allow an administrator to
          perform tests on ATM interfaces.  Tests can only be performed
          when using these objects in conjunction with [TestMIB].
          Unauthorized access to the associated objects could cause a
          denial of service, or in combination with other (e.g.,
          physical) security breaches, could cause unauthorized
          connectivity to a device. The tests defined in this document
          are not service interrupting.

          It is thus important to control even GET access to these
          objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these
          object when sending them over the network via SNMP. Not all
          versions of SNMP provide features for such a secure
          environment.

          SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the
          network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even
          then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
          allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the
          objects in this MIB.

          It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
          features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically,
          the use of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574]
          and the View-based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is
          recommended.

          It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the
          SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is
          properly configured to give access to the objects only to
          those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed
          GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
