Abstract

   This document defines extensions to iCalendar and iTIP that allow the
   expression of imprecise and multiple alternative events in calendar
   objects and scheduling messages.  Imprecise events can be used to
   imprecisely describe an event by specifying various ranked periods of
   time in which it could be scheduled.  Alternative events can be used
   to describe an event in terms of multiple ranked event descriptions,
   imprecise or not, that could alternatively be scheduled.

Internet-Draft      Imprecise and alternative events       December 2007


1.  Introduction

   Calendar users may want to express an event not by using a unique
   exact description, but in terms of several possible alternative event
   descriptions.  A possible event could, in turn, be described
   imprecisely, i.e., not with fixed start and end times, but in terms
   of one or more periods of time in which it could occur.
   Additionally, it should be possible to rank each of these alternative
   events and periods of time, so as to represent the suitability or
   likelihood of scheduling them in fact.

   These features would make possible the description of an event like
   the following: a 1 hour long business meeting taking place at office
   A on Monday between 8 am and 11 am - preferred -, or at office B on
   Thursday 2 pm or Friday after 4:30 pm.  Such flexible representation
   of an event allow users to communicate uncertainty and preferences
   that naturally occur [SL02].

   This is especially important during scheduling negotiation, when the
   "Attendees" have to agree about an event description.  Multiple
   alternative event descriptions and periods of time can help a group
   of "Attendees" to faster converge into a description that is
   acceptable for all [SD98].  In most situations, that means to reach
   consensus about an event time that satisfies a common feasible free
   time interval, but other event properties can be under negotiation as
   well (e.g., duration, location, summary).  In the worst case, if only
   the nth event proposal sent by the "Organizer" is acceptable by all
   "Attendees", offering one event description per proposal leads to n
   negotiation 'rounds'.  Conversely, in the best case, if the
   "Organizer" had proposed n alternative event descriptions, only one
   negotiation round would have been enough.

   However, iCalendar [I-D.ietf-calsify-rfc2445bis] does not provide a
   way to describe an event imprecisely or to represent multiple event
   alternatives.  This cannot be done by using several iTIP
   [I-D.ietf-calsify-2446bis] messages either.

   To accomplish these, this memo defines new types of iCalendar
   calendar components and specifies iTIP methods for their use in
   scheduling messages.


2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft      Imprecise and alternative events       December 2007


   "VEVENT" components defined by [I-D.ietf-calsify-rfc2445bis] are
   referred to as "regular events".  The term "event" is used as a
   general reference to regular events, imprecise events, and
   alternative events.


3.  iCalendar Extensions

   This specification adds the new "VIMPRECISEEVENT" and
   "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS" calendar components to iCalendar.  The
   "VIMPRECISEEVENT" component describes an imprecise event in terms of
   periods of time in which it could be scheduled.  These periods are
   expressed by "VFREEBUSY" and "VAVAILABILITY"
   [I-D.daboo-calendar-availability] components.  The
   "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS" component describes alternative events by
   grouping multiple "VEVENT" and "VIMPRECISEEVENT" event descriptions.

   Whereas the "VIMPRECISEEVENT" and "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS" components
   describe events, they are not intended to represent regular events
   that correspond to a scheduled amount of time, what is done by the
   "VEVENT" component.  Imprecise and alternative events components do
   not take up time on a calendar, since they just represent a
   schedulable amount of time whose description definition is in course.
   As such, these components MUST NOT be considered to generate results
   for an iTIP "VFREEBUSY" REQUEST, what includes CalDAV calendar-access
   [RFC4791] CALDAV:free-busy-query REPORT and CalDAV calendar-schedule
   [I-D.desruisseaux-caldav-sched] free-busy lookup.

   This specification also adds the new "RANK" property to the "VEVENT"
   and "VIMPRECISEEVENT" components, and to the "AVAILABLE" sub-
   components of the "VAVAILABILITY" component.  A new "RANK" property
   parameter is also defined for the "FREEBUSY" parameter of the
   "VFREEBUSY" component.  These extensions allow alternative events and
   periods of time used to describe imprecise events to be ranked.

   Moreover, the new "MIN-GRANULARITY" and "MAX-GRANULARITY" properties
   are introduced for the "VIMPRECISEEVENT" component.  If an imprecise
   event represents some kind of "liquid task" that can be scheduled in
   more than one regular event, these properties indicate, respectively,
   the minimum and maximum duration that each of such events should
   have.

   Component Name:  VIMPRECISEEVENT

   Purpose:  Provide an imprecise event description.

   Format Definition:  A "VIMPRECISEEVENT" calendar component is defined
      by the following notation:

          impreciseeventc     = "BEGIN" ":" "VIMPRECISEEVENT" CRLF
                                impreciseeventprop *availabilityc

                              ; if it occurs, 'duration' MUST occur

                              percent /

                              ; the following are OPTIONAL,
                              ; and MAY occur more than once

                              )

   Description:  A "VIMPRECISEEVENT" calendar component is a grouping of
      component properties, and possibly including "VFREEBUSY" and
      "VAVAILABILITY" components, that represents a schedulable amount
      of time, imprecisely described, for which exact start and end
      times are not specified.  As opposed to a regular event

Internet-Draft      Imprecise and alternative events       December 2007


      represented by a "VEVENT" component, a "VIMPRECISEEVENT" does not
      represent a scheduled amount of time on a calendar, but an
      imprecise event that, once having its temporal properties - start
      time and end time (or duration) - defined, can be represented by a
      "VEVENT" component.

      Included "VFREEBUSY" and "VAVAILABILITY" components represent
      available periods of time for effectively scheduling the event.
      The "VFREEBUSY" components MUST follow the same semantics used to
      publish busy time specified on [I-D.ietf-calsify-rfc2445bis].
      Typically, the "FBTYPE" parameter of "FREEBUSY" properties present
      on these "VFREEBUSY" components will have the "FREE" value, but
      "BUSY-TENTATIVE" and "BUSY" values MAY also be used so as to
      denote that events already scheduled on the interval represented
      by the "FREEBUSY" property could be rescheduled in favor of the
      imprecise event in question.  The "BUSY-UNAVAILABLE" value SHOULD
      NOT be used for this purpose.

      The resulting available time is the union of the periods of time
      represented by all "VFREEBUSY" and "VAVAILABILITY" components.
      Periods of time specified by the "VFREEBUSY" components MUST NOT
      overlap.  However, a period specified by a "VFREEBUSY" component
      MAY overlap those represented by "VAVAILABILITY" components.  In
      this case, the interval specified via "VFREEBUSY" overrides those
      defined by any "VAVAILABILITY" components.

      Besides the applicable properties from the "VEVENT" component, the
      "VIMPRECISEEVENT" component also allows for the "DUE" and
      "PERCENT" properties present on the iCalendar "VTODO" component.
      As in a to-do, the "DUE" property defines the date and time that
      the event is expected to be finished.  The "PERCENT" property
      specifies, in the case of a liquid task, how much of it has
      already been scheduled or accomplished into regular events, with
      respect to the "DURATION" property.  From that, the remaining
      duration that still must be scheduled can be inferred.

      In the context of an imprecise event, a "RRULE" is not intended to
      specify a concrete recurrence set of events, but to express a
      frequency of occurrence that the actual scheduled event may have.
      Within a "VIMPRECISEEVENT" component the UNTIL rule part of a
      recurrence rule MUST NOT be specified.

   Example:  The following is an example of a "VIMPRECISEEVENT" calendar
      component that describes a 2 hour long department meeting taking
      place whenever between 8:00 AM to 12:00 on April 1st, 2008:

      The following is an example of a "VIMPRECISEEVENT" calendar
      component that describes a dental treatment with total duration of
      10 hours, for which 20% have been completed.  The remaining 8
      hours can be scheduled on appointments of at least 1 hour and no
      more than 2 hours.  The "VAVAILABILITY" component specifies a 4:00
      PM to 6:00 PM recurring availability on Tuesdays and Thursdays,
      from March 15th to April 15th.  The "VFREEBUSY" component also
      overrides the "VAVAILABILITY" component between 4:00 PM and 5:00
      PM on April 1st and specifies an additional free interval from
      6:00 PM to 7:00 PM on April 3rd.

   Description:  A "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS" calendar component is a grouping
      of component properties, including at least two event components,
      that represents a schedulable amount of time, described in terms
      of alternative event descriptions, for which exact property values
      are not specified.  As opposed to a regular event represented by a
      "VEVENT" component, a "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS" does not represent a
      scheduled amount of time on a calendar, but an event with multiple
      possible alternatives that, once having its properties defined,
      can be represented by a "VEVENT" component.

      If specified on a "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS" component, OPTIONAL
      properties SHOULD also have their values interpreted as the
      default values for the properties of each grouped event component.
      In this case, if also present on a grouped event component, an
      OPTIONAL property overrides its default value.

   Example:  The following is an example of a "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS"
      calendar component used to represent an event that can take one of
      the descriptions represented by the "VEVENT" and "VIMPRECISEEVENT"
      components.  Note that the "COMMENT" property default value
      specified by the alternative events component is overridden within
      the regular event component.

3.3.  Minimum Granularity Component Property

   Property Name:  MIN-GRANULARITY

   Purpose:  This property is used to convey the minimum granularity of
      an imprecise event.

   Value Type:  DURATION

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified once in a
      "VIMPRECISEEVENT".

   Description:  This property defines the minimum duration that an
      event to be scheduled in order to accomplish a liquid task
      described by an imprecise event must have.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

           min-granularity  = "MIN-GRANULARITY" min-granulparam ":"
                              dur-value CRLF

           min-granulparam  = *(";" other-param)

           max-granulparam  = *(";" other-param)

   Example:  The following is an example of this property to show a
      maximum granularity of 2 hours.

           MAX-GRANULARITY:PT2H

3.5.  Rank Component Property

   Property Name:  RANK

   Purpose:  This property is used to convey the percent rank for
      regular and imprecise event components on the context of
      alternative events, and for availability components on the context
      of an imprecise event.

   Value Type:  INTEGER

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified once in a "VEVENT" or
      "VIMPRECISEEVENT" calendar component grouped by a
      "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS" calendar component.  This property can be
      specified once in an "AVAILABLE" sub-component of a
      "VAVAILABILITY" component.

   Description:  The property value is a positive integer between zero
      and one hundred.  A value of "0" indicates the lowest possible
      rank.  A value of "100" indicates the highest possible rank.  The
      rank may express the preference or relative availability of the
      calendar user regarding the event description or available periods
      of time it refers to.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

           rank       = "RANK" rankparam ":" integer CRLF

           rankparam  = *(";" other-param)

   Example:  The following is an example of this property to show a 40%
      rank.

           RANK:40

3.6.  Rank Property Parameter

   Parameter Name:  RANK

   Purpose:  To convey a percent rank for the property value.

   Format Definition:  This property parameter is defined by the
      following notation:

           rankpparam  = "RANK" "=" integer

   Description:  The parameter value is a positive integer between zero
      and one hundred.  A value of "0" indicates the lowest possible
      rank.  A value of "100" indicates the highest possible rank.  This
      parameter can be used on the "FREEBUSY" property to indicate the
      rank of the period of time described by it.

   Example:  The following is an example of this parameter to represent
      a 40% rank for an interval specified by a "FREEBUSY" property.

           FREEBUSY;FBTYPE=FREE;RANK=40:20080401T160000Z/PT1H

         +----------------+-----------------+--------------------+

   Implementations of this memo MUST support interchangeable use of
   VEVENT, VIMPRECISEEVENT and VALTERNATIVEEVENTS components that
   correspond to a same event.  This applies for the PUBLISH, REQUEST
   and COUNTER methods, as described below.

   PUBLISH:  Any of the event components can be interchangeably updated
      by an "Organizer" with a PUBLISH method.  For instance, a
      VIMPRECISEEVENT can be replaced by a VALTERNATIVEEVENTS
      description that corresponds to an updated version of the event.

   REQUEST:  Any of the event components can be interchangeably updated
      by an "Organizer" with a REQUEST method.  For instance, a REFRESH
      on an obsolete VIMPRECISEEVENT component can return a VEVENT
      component that corresponds to an updated version of the event.

   COUNTER:  Any of the event components can be interchangeably
      countered by an "Attendee" with a COUNTER method.  For instance, a
      VEVENT can be used to COUNTER a VIMPRECISEEVENT proposal.

   To be interpreted as different representations of the same event,
   VEVENT, VIMPRECISEEVENT and VALTERNATIVEEVENTS components MUST keep
   the original UID, updating the SEQUENCE property accordingly with the
   same rules described on [I-D.ietf-calsify-2446bis].

   The REPLY, CANCEL, REFRESH and DECLINECOUNTER methods MUST NOT be
   issued interchangeably, i.e., they can be used only with the same
   component type.  For instance, a VIMPRECISEEVENT cannot be cancelled
   by using a VEVENT CANCEL method with the same UID.

   Each method type is defined in terms of its associated components and
   properties.  Some components and properties are required, some are
   optional and others are excluded.  The restrictions are expressed in
   this document using a simple "restriction table", as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-calsify-2446bis].

4.1.  Methods for VIMPRECISEEEVENT Calendar Components

   This section defines the property set restrictions for the method
   types that are applicable to the "VIMPRECISEEEVENT" calendar
   component.  Each method is defined using a table that clarifies the
   property constraints that define the particular method.

   The following summarizes the methods that are defined for the
   "VIMPRECISEEEVENT" calendar component.

   | PUBLISH        | Post notification of an imprecise event.  Used   |
   |                | primarily as a method of advertising the         |
   |                | existence of an imprecise event.                 |
   |                |                                                  |
   | REQUEST        | Make a request for an imprecise event.  This is  |
   |                | an explicit invitation to one or more            |
   |                | "Attendees".  Imprecise event requests are also  |
   |                | used to update or change an existing event.      |
   |                | Clients that cannot handle REQUEST may degrade   |

   | REFRESH        | A request is sent to an "Organizer" by an        |

   |                | imprecise event to be resent to the requester.   |
   |                |                                                  |

   +----------------+--------------------------------------------------+

4.1.1.  PUBLISH

   The "PUBLISH" method in a "VIMPRECISEEEVENT" calendar component is an
   unsolicited posting of an iCalendar object.  Any CU may add published
   components to their calendar.  The "Organizer" MUST be present in a
   published iCalendar component.  "Attendees" MUST NOT be present.  Its
   expected usage is for encapsulating an arbitrary imprecise event as
   an iCalendar object.  The "Organizer" may subsequently update (with
   another "PUBLISH" method) or cancel (with a "CANCEL" method) a
   previously published "VIMPRECISEEVENT" calendar component.

   This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the
   following property constraints:

   Analogously to the "REQUEST" method in a "VEVENT" component, the use
   cases described in sections 3.2.2.2 to 3.2.2.7 of
   [I-D.ietf-calsify-2446bis] apply for the "VIMPRECISEEVENT" calendar
   component.

4.1.3.  REPLY

   The "REPLY" method in a "VIMPRECISEEEVENT" calendar component is used
   to respond (e.g., accept or decline) to a "REQUEST" or to reply to a
   delegation "REQUEST".  When used to provide a delegation response,
   the "Delegator" SHOULD include the calendar address of the "Delegate"
   on the "DELEGATED-TO" property parameter of the "Delegator's"
   "ATTENDEE" property.  The "Delegate" SHOULD include the calendar
   address of the "Delegator" on the "DELEGATED-FROM" property parameter
   of the "Delegate's" "ATTENDEE" property.

   The "REPLY" method may also be used to respond to an unsuccessful
   "REQUEST" method.

   The "Organizer" of an imprecise event may receive the "REPLY" method
   from a CU not in the original "REQUEST".  For example, a "REPLY" may
   be received from a "Delegate" to an event.  In addition, the "REPLY"
   method may be received from an unknown CU (a "Party Crasher").  This
   uninvited "Attendee" may be accepted, or the "Organizer" may cancel
   the event for the uninvited "Attendee" by sending a "CANCEL" method
   to the uninvited "Attendee".

   An "Attendee" can include a message to the "Organizer" using the
   "COMMENT" property.  For example, if the user indicates tentative
   acceptance and wants to let the "Organizer" know why, the reason can
   be expressed in the "COMMENT" property value.

   The "Organizer" may also receive a "REPLY" from one CU on behalf of
   another.  Like the scenario enumerated above for the "Organizer",
   "Attendees" may have another CU respond on their behalf.  This is
   done using the "SENT-BY" parameter.

   The optional properties listed in the table below (those listed as
   "0+" or "0 or 1") MUST NOT be changed from those of the original
   request.  If property changes are desired the COUNTER message must be
   used.

   This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the
   following property constraints:

4.1.4.  CANCEL

   The "CANCEL" method in a "VIMPRECISEEEVENT" calendar component is
   used to send a cancellation notice of an existing imprecise event
   request to the "Attendees".  The message is sent by the "Organizer"
   of the event.

   When a "VIMPRECISEEEVENT" is cancelled, the "SEQUENCE" property value

4.1.6.  COUNTER

   The "COUNTER" method in a "VIMPRECISEEEVENT" calendar component is
   used by an "Attendee" of an existing event (a regular event, an
   imprecise event, or an alternatives event) to submit to the
   "Organizer" a counter proposal to the event description.  The
   "Attendee" sends this message to the "Organizer" of the event.

   The counter proposal is an iCalendar object consisting of a
   VIMPRECISEEEVENT calendar component describing the complete
   description of the alternate event.

   The "Organizer" rejects the counter proposal by sending the
   "Attendee" a VIMPRECISEEEVENT "DECLINECOUNTER" method.  The
   "Organizer" accepts the counter proposal by rescheduling the event as
   described in section 3.2.2.1 of [I-D.ietf-calsify-2446bis].

   This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the
   following property constraints:

   The "DECLINECOUNTER" method in a "VIMPRECISEEEVENT" calendar
   component is used by the "Organizer" of an imprecise event to reject
   a counter proposal submitted by an "Attendee".  The "Organizer" must
   send the "DECLINECOUNTER" message to the "Attendee" that sent the

4.2.1.  PUBLISH

   The "PUBLISH" method in a "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS" calendar component is
   an unsolicited posting of an iCalendar object.  Any CU may add
   published components to their calendar.  The "Organizer" MUST be
   present in a published iCalendar component.  "Attendees" MUST NOT be
   present.  Its expected usage is for encapsulating an arbitrary
   alternatives event as an iCalendar object.  The "Organizer" may
   subsequently update (with another "PUBLISH" method) or cancel (with a
   "CANCEL" method) a previously published "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS" calendar
   component.

   This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the
   following property constraints:

4.2.2.  REQUEST

   The "REQUEST" method in a "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS" calendar component
   provides the following scheduling negotiation functions:

   o  Invite "Attendees" to an alternative events
   o  Response to a REFRESH request
   o  Update the details of an existing alternative events
   o  Update the status of "Attendees" of an existing alternative events
   o  Reconfirm an existing alternatives event
   o  Forward a "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS" to another uninvited CU
   o  For an existing "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS" calendar component, delegate
      the role of "Attendee" to another CU
   o  For an existing "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS" calendar component, changing
      the role of "Organizer" to another CU

   The "Organizer" originates the "REQUEST".  The recipients of the
   "REQUEST" method are the CUs invited to the event, the "Attendees".
   "Attendees" use the "REPLY" method to convey attendance status to the
   "Organizer".

   The "UID" and "SEQUENCE" properties are used to distinguish the
   various uses of the "REQUEST" method.  If the "UID" property value in
   the "REQUEST" is not found on the recipient's calendar, then the
   "REQUEST" is for a new "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS" calendar component.  If
   the "UID" property value is found on the recipient's calendar, then
   the "REQUEST" is for an update, or a reconfirm of the
   "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS" calendar component.

   This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the
   following property constraints:

   Analogously to the "REQUEST" method in a "VEVENT" component, the use
   cases described in sections 3.2.2.2 to 3.2.2.7 of
   [I-D.ietf-calsify-2446bis] apply for the "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS"
   calendar component.

4.2.3.  REPLY

   The "REPLY" method in a "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS" calendar component is
   used to respond (e.g., accept or decline) to a "REQUEST" or to reply
   to a delegation "REQUEST".  When used to provide a delegation
   response, the "Delegator" SHOULD include the calendar address of the
   "Delegate" on the "DELEGATED-TO" property parameter of the
   "Delegator's" "ATTENDEE" property.  The "Delegate" SHOULD include the
   calendar address of the "Delegator" on the "DELEGATED-FROM" property
   parameter of the "Delegate's" "ATTENDEE" property.

   The "REPLY" method may also be used to respond to an unsuccessful
   "REQUEST" method.

   The "Organizer" of an alternatives event may receive the "REPLY"
   method from a CU not in the original "REQUEST".  For example, a
   "REPLY" may be received from a "Delegate" to an event.  In addition,
   the "REPLY" method may be received from an unknown CU (a "Party
   Crasher").  This uninvited "Attendee" may be accepted, or the
   "Organizer" may cancel the event for the uninvited "Attendee" by
   sending a "CANCEL" method to the uninvited "Attendee".

   An "Attendee" can include a message to the "Organizer" using the
   "COMMENT" property.  For example, if the user indicates tentative
   acceptance and wants to let the "Organizer" know why, the reason can
   be expressed in the "COMMENT" property value.

   The "Organizer" may also receive a "REPLY" from one CU on behalf of
   another.  Like the scenario enumerated above for the "Organizer",
   "Attendees" may have another CU respond on their behalf.  This is
   done using the "SENT-BY" parameter.

   The optional properties listed in the table below (those listed as
   "0+" or "0 or 1") MUST NOT be changed from those of the original
   request.  If property changes are desired the COUNTER message must be
   used.

   This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the
   following property constraints:

   of the event.

   When a "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS" is cancelled, the "SEQUENCE" property
   value MUST be incremented.

4.2.6.  COUNTER

   The "COUNTER" method in a "VALTERNATIVEEVENTS" calendar component is
   used by an "Attendee" of an existing event (a regular event, an
   imprecise event, or an alternatives event) to submit to the
   "Organizer" a counter proposal to the event description.  The
   "Attendee" sends this message to the "Organizer" of the event.

   The counter proposal is an iCalendar object consisting of a
   VALTERNATIVEEVENTS calendar component describing the complete
   description of the alternate event.

   The "Organizer" rejects the counter proposal by sending the
   "Attendee" a VALTERNATIVEEVENTS "DECLINECOUNTER" method.  The
   "Organizer" accepts the counter proposal by rescheduling the event as
   described in section 3.2.2.1 of [I-D.ietf-calsify-2446bis].

   This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the
   following property constraints:

   These examples are complementary to those presented in
   [I-D.ietf-calsify-2446bis].

5.1.  Published Imprecise Event

   The iCalendar object below describes a published imprecise event,
   organized by a person "A", with the purpose to announce an event for
   which the exact start time is not defined yet.

Appendix A.  Design Considerations

   This section points out some protocol design issues concerning the
   described extensions.

   In particular, the need of new special "event" components to support
   imprecise and alternative events can be questioned.  They can
   represent an interoperability problem with current implementations,
   and may overload workflow scheduling requirements, making it more
   complex, as VIMPRECISEEVENT and VALTERNATIVEEVENTS are intended to be
   used interchangeably with VEVENT during scheduling negotiation.  When
   receiving a VEVENT / VIMPRECISEEVENT / VALTERNATIVEEVENTS scheduling
   message, it will be necessary to look for pre-existing components of
   these three types (and not only VEVENT components anymore).

   One may argue that a simpler solution for this would be an extension
   of the existing VEVENT component and method types to support
   imprecise and alternative descriptions.  Design choices that could be
   made to do so - and reasons for not adopting them - are presented
   here.

A.1.  Avoiding VALTERNATIVEEVENTS

   An extension of VEVENT to support alternative events descriptions
   could consist on using the RELATED-TO property to link multiple event
   components with each their own alternatives and creating a new
   property to denote that these components should be interpreted as
   alternative descriptions.  However, because only one UID is used for
   all VEVENT components, that wouldn't allow for this use case: user A



Silva & Drummond          Expires June 22, 2008                [Page 51]

Internet-Draft      Imprecise and alternative events       December 2007


   suggests an event with instance specific information, and user B
   wants to COUNTER with two alternatives - a new one (possibly with a
   high rank), and the original one, composed by several instances (with
   a lower rank).  In this case, both alternatives proposed by user B
   must be identified by the same original UID from A's invitation.
   This can be solved by a VALTERNATIVEEVENTS wrapper component which
   would have that UID.

   Using VEVENT components with different UIDs and grouping those which
   have the same UID as recurring events with instance specific
   information would not be a solution, because the reference to the UID
   of the original request is lost.  Using another new relationship
   parameter and RECURRENCE-ID as a secondary key to do this grouping is
   also limiting, because it would prohibit two alternatives starting at
   the same time but with different properties (e.g., location).  Thus,
   a solution without VALTERNATIVEEVENTS would not be really flexible.

A.2.  Avoiding VIMPRECISEEVENT

   Some alternatives for not creating a new VIMPRECISEEVENT component
   could also be considered.  Relax VEVENT and allow it to be a
   container for VFREEBUSY and VAVAILABILITY components would be a bad
   solution, as present implementations would have problems attempting
   to parse these (so far invalid) VEVENT components.  But a new
   property could be created to denote that the event should be
   interpreted as an imprecise description, and this event component
   could be linked with VFREEBUSY and VAVAILABILITY components via a new
   property or even RELATED-TO.

   But that would imply on ignoring the DTSTART and DTEND properties,
   because they do not make sense in an imprecise event.  Since they are
   always expected, their meaning could be changed by the presence of
   another property, which should also enforce the additional recurrence
   limitations described on this specification.  The drawback with this
   approach is that, by definition, an event takes up time on a
   calendar, what would demand workarounds (e.g., setting TRANSP:
   TRANSPARENT) so as to prevent these events in a calendar store to be
   accounted in free-busy queries by current implementations.

   Using 0+ VFREEBUSY and VAVAILABILITY components in a VEVENT iTIP
   message would not be a satisfactory option either: if two or more
   imprecise descriptions were used as alternative events, the available
   periods of time would refer to all descriptions, and not to a
   specific one, due to the single UID constraint for VEVENT methods.
   That can be a problem if the availability depends on properties of
   the event description (e.g., location), what makes of VIMPRECISEEVENT
   a simpler way to separate semantics between regular and imprecise
   events.

A.3.  Compatibility

   We definitely agree that creating the new components breaks
   compatibility with current implementations and can raise
   interoperability issues.  On the other hand, it should be considered
   that the purpose of these extensions is to add new semantics to
   scheduling negotiation, not only additional information to the
   concept of events as is.

   While adapting the VEVENT component could be a good fallback for CUAs
   not implementing the extensions, it would result in meaningless - or
   even incorrect - interpretation, what would not be useful and might
   cause problems.  CUAs without the capability to understand the
   concept of imprecise and alternative events should indeed complain
   about receiving an invalid iTIP message (maybe replying with a
   request-status error 3.12/3.13) and be out of scheduling negotiation
   rounds until only one VEVENT description comes into consideration.


Appendix B.  Change History (to be removed by RFC Editor prior to
             publication)

   Changes from -00:

   a.  Description of the methods for the new components revised and
       completed.

   b.  Added text to clarify relationship among regular, imprecise and
       alternative events, and a description on how their methods can be
       used interchangeably.

   c.  Changed intended status to experimental.

   d.  Added percent property to imprecise events.

   e.  New minimum and maximum granularity properties added to imprecise
       events.

   f.  Simplified restriction tables by referring to repeating
       restrictions on sub-components already presented.

   g.  Design Considerations on appendix A rewritten and made permanent.

   h.  Minor editorial changes.
