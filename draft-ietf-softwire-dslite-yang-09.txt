Internet-Draft            DS-Lite YANG Modules             November 2017


   DS-Lite deployment considerations are discussed in [RFC6908].

   This document follows the guidelines of [RFC6087], uses the common
   YANG types defined in [RFC6991], and adopts the Network Management
   Datastore Architecture (NMDA).

1.1.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the terms defined in Section 3 of
   [RFC6333].

   The terminology for describing YANG data modules is defined in
   [RFC7950].

   The meaning of the symbols in tree diagrams is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-tree-diagrams].

2.  DS-Lite YANG Modules: An Overview

   As shown in Figure 1:

   o  The AFTR element is a combination of an IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel and a
      NAPT function (Section 2.2 of [RFC3022]).

   o  The B4 element is an IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel.

   Therefore, the AFTR YANG module is designed to augment both the
   Interfaces YANG module [RFC7223] and the NAT YANG module
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-nat-yang] with DS-Lite specific features.  The B4
   YANG module augments the interfaces YANG module.

   Concretely, the AFTR YANG module (Figure 2) augments the Interfaces
   YANG module with the following:

   o  An IPv6 address used by the AFTR for sending and receiving IPv4-
      in-IPv6 packets (aftr-ipv6-address).

   o  An IPv4 address that is used by the AFTR for troubleshooting
      purposes (aftr-ipv4-address).

   o  The tunnel MTU, used to avoid fragmentation (tunnel-mtu).

   o  A policy to instruct the AFTR whether it must preserve DSCP
      marking when encapsulating/decapsulating packets (v6-v4-dscp-
      preservation).

   In addition, the AFTR YANG module augments the NAT YANG module
   (policy, in particular) with the following:



Boucadair, et al.         Expires May 17, 2018                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft            DS-Lite YANG Modules             November 2017


   o  A policy to limit the number of DS-Lite softwires per subscriber
      (max-softwire-per-subscriber).

   o  A policy to instruct the AFTR whether a state can be automatically
      migrated (state-migrate).

   o  Further, in order to prevent a denial-of-service by frequently
      changing the source IPv6 address, 'b4-address-change-limit' is
      used to rate-lmite such changes.

   o  An instruction to rewrite the TCP Maximum Segment Size (MSS)
      option (mss-clamping) to avoid TCP fragmentation.

   Given that the NAPT table of the AFTR element is extended to include
   the source IPv6 address of incoming packets, the AFTR YANG module
   augments the NAPT44 mapping-entry with the following:

   o  b4-ipv6-address which is used to record the source IPv6 address of
      a packet received from a B4 element.  This IPv6 address is
      required to disambiguate between the overlapping IPv4 address
      space of subscribers.

   o  The value of the Traffic Class field in the IPv6 header as
      received from a B4 element (v6-dscp): This information is used to
      preserve DSCP marking when encapsulating/decapsulationg at the
      AFTR.

   o  The IPv4 DSCP marking of the IPv4 packet received from a B4
      element (internal-v4-dscp): This information can be used by the
      AFTR for setting the DSCP of packets relayed to a B4 element.

   o  The IPv4 DSCP marking as set by the AFTR in its external interface
      (external-v4-dscp): An AFTR can be instructed to preserve the same
      marking or to set it to another value when forwarding an IPv4
      packet upstream.

   Access Control List (ACL) and Quality of Service (QoS) policies
   discussed in Section 2.5 of [RFC6908] are out of scope.  A YANG
   module for ACLs is documented in [I-D.ietf-netmod-acl-model].

   Likewise, PCP-related considerations discussed in Section 8.5 of
   [RFC6333] are out of scope.  A YANG module for PCP is documented in
   [I-D.boucadair-pcp-yang].

   The B4 YANG module (Figure 3) augments the Interfaces YANG module
   with the following:

   o  An IPv6 address used by a B4 element for sending and receiving
      IPv4-in-IPv6 packets (b4-ipv6-address).

   o  The IPv6 address of the AFTR to use by a B4 element (aftr-
      ipv6-addr).

   o  An IPv4 address that is used by a B4 element for troubleshooting
      purposes (b4-ipv4-address).

   o  The tunnel MTU at the B4 side to avoid fragmentation (tunnel-mtu).

        the previous B4's IPv6 address will be redirected to the newer
        B4's IPv6 address.  The destination IPv6 address for tunneling
        return traffic from the AFTR should be the last seen as the B4's
        IPv6 source address from the CPE.

        The AFTR uses the subscriber-mask to determine whether two
        IPv6 addresses belong to the same CPE (e.g., if the
        subscriber-mask is set to 56, the AFTR concludes that
        2001:db8:100:100::1 and 2001:db8:100:100::2 belong to the same
        CPE assigned with 2001:db8:100:100::/56).";

5.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this document is designed to be accessed
   via network management protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or
   RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport
   layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure
   Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the
   mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS [RFC5246].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC6536] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

Internet-Draft            DS-Lite YANG Modules             November 2017


   All data nodes defined in the YANG module which can be created,
   modified and deleted (i.e., config true, which is the default) are
   considered sensitive.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config) applied
   to these data nodes without proper protection can negatively affect
   network operations.  An attacker who is able to access to the B4/AFTR
   can undertake various attacks, such as:

   o  Set the value of 'aftr-ipv6-addr' on the B4 to point to an
      illegitimate AFTR so that it can intercept all the traffic sent by
      a B4.  Illegitimately intercepting users' traffic is a attack with
      severe implications on privacy.

   o  Set the MTU to a low value which may increase the number of
      fragments ('tunnel-mtu' for both B4 and AFTR).

   o  Set 'max-softwire-per-subscriber' to an arbitrary high value,
      which will be exploited by a misbehaving user to grab more
      resources (by mounting as many softwires as required to get more
      external IP addresses/ports) or to perform a Denial-of-Service on
      the AFTR by mounting a massive number of softwires.

   o  Set 'state-migrate' to 'false' on the AFTR.  This action may lead
      to a service degradation for the users.

   o  Set 'b4-address-change-limit" to an arbitrary low value can ease
      DoS attacks based on frequent change of B4 IPv6 address.

   o  Set 'v6-v4-dscp-preservation' to 'false" may lead to a service
      degradation if some policies are applied on the network based on
      the DSCP value.

   Additional security considerations are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-nat-yang].

   Security considerations related to DS-Lite are discussed in
   [RFC6333].

Internet-Draft            DS-Lite YANG Modules             November 2017


Appendix A.  B4 Example

   The following example shows a B4 element (2001:db8:0:1::1) that is
   configured with an AFTR element (2001:db8:0:2::1).  The B4 element is
   also instructed to preserve the DSCP marking.

   <interface>
      <name>myB4</name>
      <type>ianaift:tunnel</type>
      <enabled>true</enabled>
      <b4-ipv6-address>2001:db8:0:1::1</b4-ipv6-address>
      <aftr-ipv6-addr>2001:db8:0:2::1</aftr-ipv6-addr>
      <v6-v4-dscp-preservation>true</v6-v4-dscp-preservation>
   </interface>

Appendix B.  AFTR Examples

   The following example shows an AFTR that is reachable at
   2001:db8:0:2::1.  Also, this XML snippet indicates that the AFTR is
   provided with an IPv4 address (192.0.0.1) to be used for
   troubleshooting purposes such as reporting problems to B4s.

   Note that a subscriber is identified by a subscriber-mask ([RFC7785])
   that can be configured by means of [I-D.ietf-opsawg-nat-yang].

   <interface>
      <name>myAFTR</name>
      <type>ianaift:tunnel</type>
      <enabled>true</enabled>
      <aftr-ipv6-address>2001:db8:0:2::1</aftr-ipv6-address>
      <aftr-ipv4-address>192.0.0.1</aftr-ipv4-address>
   </interface>

   The following shows an XML excerpt depicting a dynamic UDP mapping
   entry maintained by a DS-Lite AFTR for a packet received from the B4
   element introduced in Appendix A.  Concretely, this UDP packet
   received with a source IPv6 address (2001:db8:0:1::1), a source IPv4
   address (192.0.2.1), and source port number (1568) is translated into
   a UDP packet having a source IPv4 address (198.51.100.1) and source
   port number (15000).  The remaining lifetime of this mapping is 300
   seconds.
