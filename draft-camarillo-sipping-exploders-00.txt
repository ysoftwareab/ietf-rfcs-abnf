Internet-Draft      Reqs for SIP Exploder Invocation      September 2003


1. Introduction

   Some applications require that, at a given moment, a SIP UA performs
   a similar transaction with a number of remote UAs. For example, an
   instant messaging application that needs to send a particular message
   (e.g., "Hello folks") to n receivers needs to send n MESSAGE
   requests; one to each receiver.

   When the transacton that needs to be repeated consists of a large
   request and/or the number of recipients is high, the access network
   of the UA needs to carry a considerable amount of traffic. Completing
   all the transactions on a low-bandwidth access would require a long
   time. This is unacceptable for some applications.

   A solution to this problem consists of introducing exploders in the
   network. The task of an exploder is to receive a request from a UA
   and send a number of similar requests to a number of destinations.
   Once the requests are sent, the exploder needs to inform the UA about
   their status. Effectively, the exploder behaves as a B2BUA.

   Note that resource lists, as described in [2], already use SIP
   exploders for SUBSCRIBE transactions. However, the set of
   destinations needs to be preconfigured using out-of-band mechanisms
   (e.g., XCAP).

   The Advanced Instant Messaging Requirements for SIP  [3] also
   mentions the need for exploders for MESSAGE transactions:

   "REQ-GROUP-3: It MUST be possible for a user to send to an ad-hoc
   group, where the identities of the recipients are carried in the
   message itself."

   The remainder of this document provides requirements for a potential
   mechanism that would allow UAs to invoke exploders in an efficient
   manner.

2. Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1] and indicate requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.

3. Requirements

   1.  The invocation mechanism MUST NOT be request specific.

   2.  The invocation mechanism SHOULD NOT require more than one RTT.

   3.  The exploder MUST be able to inform the invoking UA about the
       status of the transactions initiated by the exploder.

   4.  The UA MUST be able to provide credentials to the exploder so
       that the exploder can use them to prove to the destinations that
       it is sending requests on behalf of the UA.

   5.  The set of destinations provided to the exploder MAY consist of a
       single destination or multiple ones.

   6.  When handling requests that establish sessions (e.g., INVITE),
       the exploder MAY get involved in the session (e.g., perform media
       manipulations) acting as a B2BUA.


4. Security Considerations

   Requirements related to security are considered in Section 3.

5. Acknowledges

   Duncan Mills and Miguel A. Garcia-Martin supported the idea of 1 to n
   MESSAGEs.
