Internet-Draft        Sieve Notification using SIP             July 2007


1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [5].


2.  Background

   Sieve [1] is an email filtering language.  Individual rules in this
   language check for specific conditions, and then execute specific
   actions.  One supported action sends a Sieve notification [2], for
   example using email [9] or XMPP [10] (Extensible Messaging and
   Presence Protocol).

   SIP [3] is a protocol used for rendezvous, management of multimedia
   sessions, and relevant event notifications [4].  Messaging Waiting
   Indication is a common feature of telephone networks.  It typically
   involves an audible or visible indication that messages are waiting,
   such as playing a special dial tone, lighting a light or indicator on
   the phone, displaying icons or text, or some combination.  RFC 3842
   [7] defines a SIP event package to alert the subscriber when the
   types of messages available have changed.

   Using SIP-Specific Event Notification, A Subscriber User Agent
   (typically an IP phone or SIP software User Agent) subscribes to the
   status of their messages.  A SIP User Agent acting on behalf of the
   user's messaging system then notifies the Subscriber whenever the
   messaging account's messages have changed.  (This Notifier could be
   composed with a User Agent that provides a real-time media interface
   to send or receive messages, or it could be a standalone entitiy.)
   The Notifier sends a message summary in the body of a NOTIFY, encoded
   in a new MIME type defined later in this document.  A User Agent can
   also explicitly fetch the current status.

   This document describes how to use the existing SIP message-summary
   event package to convey only notifications specified by the Sieve
   filtering language.  Sieve notifications in the context of this event
   package are always explicitly authorized.  This avoids delivering
   notifications about possibly unwanted unsolicited events.

   The Email System Event Notification Model [12] describes sending
   notifications about several kinds of events which are relevant to
   email systems [11], and describes a model to convey those
   notifications.  This document is largely orthogonal in that it
   provides access to almost none of the mailbox events, and it
   explicitly defines a mechanism to dynamically setup a sieve filter
   and solicit notifications indirectly triggered by new incoming

   messages (which the model does not address).  The notifier for this
   package could be collocated with the "Publisher Notifications
   Aggregator (PNA)" role described in the model document.


3.  Use of Sieve filters in a message-summary subscription

   SIP event notification is designed to present consistent, reliable,
   synchronized state even when SIP user agents temporarily lose and re-
   establish network connectivity.  Because of this design requirement,
   a new subscription always contains an explicit initial state.  In the
   context of Sieve notifications, this initial state can contain
   notifications that the subscriber has not seen yet, even if those
   notifications where already sent using other notification methods or
   received by other SIP subscribers.  Since multiple Sieve
   notifications could be received in a single NOTIFY request, the
   notifications are enclosed in a simple container using XML, as
   described in the next section.

   To explicitly indicate the begining of time to use for notifications,
   the subscriber can include a new optional SIP Event header parameter
   'notify-counter'.  If this parameter is included, the notifier can
   provide notifications consistent with this "version" of the notify-
   counter.  If the notification contains the same notify-counter as the
   corresponding subscription, the subscriber knows that it did not miss
   any notifications.

   When a MIME body is included in a SIP SUBSCRIBE request, this body is
   treated as an event filter.  In this application, the filter is an
   "application/sieve" document, with a few specific requirements
   described below.

   The filter document used for filtering SHOULD NOT include Actions
   other than "notify", for example: keep, delete, or fileto.  The Sieve
   notify tag ":method" MUST NOT be included, and MUST be ignored if it
   present.  The notification method and URI are already specified more
   formally in the SIP SUBSCRIBE request.  Likewise the notify tag
   ":from" MUST be ignored.  The From header of the notification is
   already set in the SIP dialog used for the subscription.

   The ":message" notify tag is used to construct a (probably human-
   readable) string that appears in the 'message' element of the
   notification.  This document also defines a new notify option
   "headerlist" (used with the ":options" notify tag).  The value of the
   "headerlist" option is a comma-separated list of email headers, each
   of which will be included in its own 'header' element in the
   notification.  The usage of the headerlist is completely optional.

4.  New MIME Type for notification bodies

   This section defines a new MIME type "application/
   sieve-notification+xml".  This document format contains a top-level
   'sieve-notifications' element, which has a mandatory 'notify-counter'
   attribute.  This counter is an unsigned integer.  This element
   contains zero or more 'notification' elements.  Each 'notification'
   element contains exactly one 'message' element with the populated
   contents of the ":message" notify tag.  Each 'notification' element
   can also contain zero or more 'header' elements.  Each 'header'
   element has a mandatory 'name' attribute with the name of a header
   from the 'headerlist' ":options" notify tag.  The contents of the
   'header' element is the value of the named header.

   A relax NG schema for this body type is included in the Appendix.
   Below is a Sieve filter in a SUBSCRIBE body, and the corresponding
   notification body.  A full example is given in the next section.

   === SUBSCRIBE Body ===
   require ["enotify"];

   if header :contains "from" "example.com" {
        notify :message "Reminder to call about project foobar"
               :options "headerlist" "From,Subject";
   }

   === NOTIFY Body ===
   <?xml version="1.0"?>
   <sieve-notifications notify-counter="4589">
     <notification>
       <header name="From">alice@example.com</header>
       <header name="Subject">Foobar status report</header>
       <message>Reminder to call about project foobar</message>
     </notification>
   </sieve-notifications>


5.  Example Message Flow

   The examples shown below are for informational purposes only.

   In the example call flow below, Alice's IP phone subscribes to the
   status of Alice's messages.  Via headers are omitted for clarity.

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur

   Event header parameter with the name 'notify-counter'.  Its formal
   syntax is described below:

   notify-counter = "notify-counter" EQUAL 1*DIGIT

7.  Security Considerations

   The bulk of the relevant privacy and security considerations are
   discussed in Sieve [1] and Sieve notifications [2].  In addition, SIP
   [3] subscriptions SHOULD be authenticated and authorized to fetch
   notifications for the target SIP resource / mailbox.  (Digest
   authentication is mandatory to implement in all SIP nodes.)  In
   addition, the SIP Identity header [8] can be used to insure that
   notifications were not forged and were not modified in transit.  To
   prevent eavesdropping, the SIP subscriber could insist on using the
   sips: scheme which insures that SIP messages are only sent over TLS
   protected channels.  Finally, a truly paranoid user can use the SIP
   S/MIME mechanism for end-to-end encryption, authentication, and
   message integrity.
