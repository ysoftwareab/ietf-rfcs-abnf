   [MPLSArch]/Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Virtual Private Networks
   (VPNs) [RFC2547bis].
   

2.0  Introduction

   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   the Internet community.  In particular, it describes managed objects
   for modeling a Multi-Protocol Label Switching [MPLSArch,
   MPLSFW]/Border Gateway Protocol Virtual Private Networks.
   
   Comments should be made directly to the MPLS mailing list at
   mpls@uu.net and the Provider-Provisioned VPN (PPVPN) WG at
   ppvpn@ietf.org.
   
   This memo does not, in its draft form, specify a standard for the
   Internet community.
   
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119, reference
   [BCP14].
   

3.0  Terminology

   This document uses terminology from the document describing the MPLS
   architecture [MPLSArch] and from the document describing MPLS/BGP
   VPNs [MPLSBGPVPN].
   
   Throughout this document, the use of the terms "Provider Edge (PE)
   and Customer Edge (CE) or PE/CE" will be replaced by PE in all cases
   except when a network device is a CE when used in the carrier of
   carriers model.


4.0  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:
   
   -  An overall architecture, as described in RFC 2271 [SNMPArch].
   
   -  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
      purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in RFC
      1155 [SMIv1], RFC 1212 [SNMPv1MIBDef] and RFC 1215 [SNMPv1Traps].
      The second version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902
      [SMIv2], RFC 1903 [SNMPv2TC] and RFC 1904 [SNMPv2Conf].
   
   -  Message protocols for transferring management information. The
      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
      described in RFC 1157 [SNMPv1].  A second version of the SNMP
      message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
      protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [SNMPv2c]
      and RFC 1906 [SNMPv2TM].  The third version of the message
      protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [SNMPv2TM],
      RFC 2272 [SNMPv3MP] and RFC 2574 [SNMPv3USM].
   
   -  Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
      described in RFC 1157 [SNMPv1].  A second set of protocol
      operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
      [SNMPv2PO].
   
   -  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273
      [SNMPv3App] and the view-based access control mechanism described
      in RFC 2575 [SNMPv3VACM].
   
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed



PPVPN Working Group             Expires June 2002            [Page 3]

Internet Draft          PPVPN MPLS VPN MIB          November 13, 2001



   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.  This memo specifies
   a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A MIB conforming to the
   SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate translations.  The
   resulting translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except
   where objects or events are omitted because no translation is
   possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine-readable information in
   SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the
   translation process.  However, this loss of machine-readable
   information is not considered to change the semantics of the MIB.


5.0  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One  (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name. The object type
   together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to also refer to
   the object type.
   

6.0  Feature Checklist
   
   The MPLS/BGP Virtual Private Network MIB (MPLS-VPN-MIB) is designed
   to satisfy the following requirements and constraints:

     1.   The MIB must support the BGP/MPLS Virtual Private Networks as
          described in [RFC2547bis]. It does not support other
          generalized network-based VPN solutions such as IPSec VPNs 
          [RFC2547bis].
     
     2.   The MIB must support the operation of BGP/MPLS VPN based on 
          either an IP backbone that contains only routers/switches, 
          or a layer-2 backbone (e.g. Frame Relay, ATM).
     
     3.   The MIB must support BGP/MPLS VPN service as Enterprise VPN,
          Carrier's Carrier VPN, or Inter-provider Backbone VPN.
     
     4.   The MIB must support the configuration of BGP/MPLS VPNs under the
          scope listed above in 1, 2, and 3. It can be used for
          service creation and validation, or building the
          configuration tools to achieve MPLS VPN service creation 
          automation.
     
     5.   The MIB must support the maintenance and troubleshooting of
          BGP/MPLS VPN under the scope listed in 1, 2, and 3. It can



PPVPN Working Group             Expires June 2002            [Page 4]

Internet Draft          PPVPN MPLS VPN MIB          November 13, 2001



          be used, in conjunction with other MIBs to build monitoring
          and troubleshooting network management tools.
     
     6.   The MIB must support BGP/MPLS VPNs that are configured on a
          particular physical or sub-interface if the interface can be 
          divided (e.g. Frame Relay or ATM) by the router. The PE or CE 
          (in the case of carrier supporing carriers) will determine the
          forwarding table to be used based on the particular interface 
          or sub-interface information.
     
     7.   The MIB must be supported by PE/CEs and shall be used to 
          configure and maintain one or more VPN Routing and Forwarding 
          Tables (VRFs).
     
     8.   The MIB must be supported by each interface or sub-interface on a
          PE/CE that can be configured for a single VPN only.

     9.   The MIB must support a configuration where each interface 
          belonging to a particular VPN on the PE router can be 
          configured to import or export the information from the same 
          VPN at different sites. These interfaces must also be capable 
          of being configured to import or export the routing information 
          from the different VPNs at the different sites.


7.0  Assumptions and Prerequisites

   It is assumed that certain things are configured and operational in
   order for the tables and objects described in this MIB to work
   correctly. These things are outlined below:
   
   - MPLS in general, must be configured and operational.
   
   - LDP paths configured between PEs and CEs.
   
   - Underlying MPLS interfaces on which the MPLS-VPN interfaces are
     run "on top of" must be configured and operational.
   

8.0  Application of the Interfaces Group to MPLS
   
   The Interfaces Group of MIB II defines generic managed objects for
   managing interfaces.  This memo contains the media-specific
   extensions to the Interfaces Group for managing MPLS interfaces.
   
   This memo assumes the interpretation of the Interfaces Group to be in
   accordance with [IFMIB] which states that the interfaces table
   (ifTable) contains information on the managed resource's interfaces
   and that each sub-layer below the internetwork layer of a network
   interface is considered an interface. A MPLS VPN-enabled



PPVPN Working Group             Expires June 2002            [Page 5]

Internet Draft          PPVPN MPLS VPN MIB          November 13, 2001



   interface is represented as an entry in the ifTable with 
   ifType = mpls(166) [LSRMIB]. It is also possible that MPLS TE Tunnels 
   are used to transport MPLS BGP/VPN traffic. In this case the entry 
   in the ifTable is associated with an interface with ifType equal to
   mplsTunnel(150) [TEMIB] which, in turn, is 'stacked' upon 
   an MPLS-type interface. Finally, it is also possible that a 
   non-MPLS interface type, such as an Ethernet interface, is used
   transport MPLS BGP/VPN traffic. In this case the MPLS VPN-enabled
   interface is represented as an entry in the ifTable with 
   an ifType corresponding to the interface type such as 
   ethernet-csmacd(6).

   The inter-relation of entries in the ifTable is defined by the 
   Interfaces Stack Group defined in [IFMIB]. The VPN interface
   should keep track of statistics and other interface related
   information for that VPN interface only. These interface statistics
   should be a subset of those maintained on the underlying (MPLS)
   interface(s). That is, the bytes received on an MPLS VPN
   interface should be less than or equal to those noted as received
   on the underlying interface onto which the VPN interface is stacked.
   
   When using MPLS VPN-enabled interfaces, the interface stack table
   should appear as follows:
   
      +-------------------------------------------+
      | MPLS-interface ifType = mpls(166)         +
      +-------------------------------------------+
      | Underlying Layer...                       +
      +-------------------------------------------+
   
   In the above diagram, "Underlying Layer..." refers to the ifIndex of
   any interface type, which has been defined for MPLS interworking and
   onto which the MPLS-layer is stacked upon. Examples include ATM,
   Frame Relay, Ethernet, etc.
   
   It is also possible that the interface stack table appear as follows
   in the case that MPLS TE Tunnels are used to transport the MPLS VPN
   traffic:
   
      +-------------------------------------------+
      | MPLS TE Tunnel  ifType = mplsTunnel(150)  |
      +-------------------------------------------+
      | MPLS-interface ifType = mpls(166)         +
      +-------------------------------------------+
      | Underlying Layer...                       +
      +-------------------------------------------+

   A non-MPLS type of interface carrying MPLS VPN traffic should be 
   represented as follows:

9.0  Brief Description of MIB Objects

   The following subsections describe the purpose of each of the objects
   contained in the MPLS-VPN-MIB.

9.1  mplsVpnVrfTable

   This table represents the MPLS/BGP VPNs that are configured.
   An operator or Network Management System (NMS) creates an
   entry in this table for every MPLS/BGP VPN configured to run
   in this MPLS domain. A VRF represents an instance of a VPN
   supported by one or more PE Routers. The collection of VRFs
   from all network devices comprises the actual VPN.
   
   It should be noted that the VPN that is configured at
   a particular device represents an instance of that VPN
   and not the entire VPN. The collective set of VPN instances comprises
   the actual VPN. This information is typically
   only known in its entirety at the NMS.

9.2  mplsVPNInterfaceConfTable

   This table represents the MPLS/BGP VPN-enabled interfaces.
   Each entry in this table corresponds to an entry in the
   Interfaces MIB. In addition, each entry extends its
   corresponding entry in the Interface MIB to contain
   specific BGP/MPLS VPN information. Due to this
   correspondence, certain objects such as traffic counters
   are not found in this MIB to avoid overlap, and instead
   are found in the Interfaces MIB.

9.3  mplsVPNPerfTable

   This table contains objects to measure the performance of
   MPLS/BGP VPNs and augments the mplsVPNConfTable. High
   capacity counters are provided for objects that are likely
   to wrap around quickly on objects such as high-speed interface
   counters.


9.4  mplsVpnVrfRouteTable

   The table contains the objects necessary to configure and monitor
   routes for a particular VRF.

9.5  MplsVpnRouteTargetTable

Internet Draft          PPVPN MPLS VPN MIB          November 13, 2001




   The table contains the objects necessary to configure and monitor
   route targets for a particular VRF.

10.0 Example of MPLS/BGP VPN Setup

   In this section, we provide a brief example of using the MIB
   objects described in the following section. While this example
   is not meant to illustrate very nuance of the MIB, it is intended
   as an aid to understanding some of the key concepts.  It is our
   intent that it is read only after the reader has gone through
   the MIB itself.
   
   This configuration is under the assumption that 1) MPLS has been pre-
   configured in the network, through enabling LDP or RSVP-TE. 2) OSPF
   or ISIS has been pre-configured. 3) BGP sessions have been
   established between PEs.
   
   Defining the VPN:


In mplsVpnVrfTable:
{
   mplsVpnVrfName               = "RED",
   mplsVpnVrfDescription        = "Intranet of Company ABC",
   mplsVpnVrfRouteDistinguisher = 100:1,
   }

In mplsVpnVrfRouteTargetTable
   mplsVpnVrfRouteTargetRowStatus."Red"."100:1".import = createAndGo,
   mplsVpnVrfRouteTargetRowStatus."Red"."100:1".export = createAndGo
   }

   Configuring PE to PE BGP Routing Session with BGP
   extended family
   
In mplsVpnVrfTable:
   {
   mplsVpnVrfBgpAddrFamilyVpnv4Unicast = true (1),
   mplsVpnVrfBgpAFNeighborPEAddr       = 10.10.10.1 {the other PE},
   mplsVpnVrfBgpAFNeighborPEType       = IpV4
   }

   Configuring PE to CE BGP Routing Sessions:
   
In mplsVpnVrfTable:
   {
   mplsVpnVrfName                      = "RED",
   mplsVpnVrfBgpAddrFamilyVpnv4Unicast = true (1),
   mplsVpnVrfBgpAFNeighborCEAddr       = 192.123.123.1 {adjacent CE},

   mplsVpnVrfBgpAFNeighborCEType       = IpV4
   }
   
   (or Configuring PE to CE RIP Routing Sessions)

In mplsVpnVrfTable:
   {
   mplsVpnVrfName                      = "RED",
   mplsVpnVrfNetType                   = rip(2),
   mplsVpnVrfRipNetPrefix              = 192.123.123.4 {the network
                                         prefix  to the adjacent CE),
   }

   (or Configuring PE to CE Static Routing Sessions)
   
In mplsVpnVrfTable:
   {
   mplsVpnVrfName                    = "RED",
   mplsVpnVrfIpRouteVrfForwByType    = IpV4 (1)
   mplsVpnVrfIpRouteVrfDest          = 192.123.210.1 {destination},
   mplsVpnVrfIpRouteVrfForwByAddr    = 192.123.123.1 {forwarded by},
   mplsVpnVrfIpRouteRedistributeConn = true (1)
   }

   Note that this example assumes that the P routers are configured with
   MPLS LDP and RSVP TE tunnels using existing MIBs.
   
   
   Ed Notes:
   
   Need to add route target table here.
   
   Step 1: create VRF; result (VRF + I/F associations + BGP peers,
   routes etc)
   
   Step 2: verification; how
   
   Also a monitoring example would be helpful
