1.  Introduction

   Vehicular networks have been focused on the driving safety, driving
   efficiency, and entertainment in road networks.  The Federal
   Communications Commission (FCC) in the US allocated wireless channels
   for Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) service in the

   Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Radio Service in the
   5.850-5.925 GHz band (5.9 GHz band).  DSRC-based wireless
   communications can support vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-
   infrastructure (V2I), and infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) networking.

   For driving safety services based on the DSRC, IEEE has standardized
   Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) standards, such as
   IEEE 802.11p [IEEE-802.11p], IEEE 1609.2 [WAVE-1609.2], IEEE 1609.3
   [WAVE-1609.3], and IEEE 1609.4 [WAVE-1609.4].  Note that IEEE 802.11p
   has been published as IEEE 802.11 Outside the Context of a Basic
   Service Set (OCB) [IEEE-802.11-OCB] in 2012.  Along with these WAVE
   standards, IPv6 and Mobile IP protocols (e.g., MIPv4 and MIPv6) can
   be extended to vehicular networks [RFC2460][RFC6275].

   This document discusses use cases, survey, and problem statements
   related to IP-based vehicular networking for Intelligent
   Transportation Systems (ITS).  This document first surveys the use
   cases for using V2V and V2I networking in the ITS.  Second, this
   document deals with some critical aspects in vehicular networking,
   such as vehicular network architectures, standardization activities,
   IP address autoconfiguration, routing, mobility management, DNS
   naming service, service discovery, and security and privacy.  For
   each aspect, this document shows problem statement to analyze the gap
   between the state-of-the-art techniques and requirements in IP-based
   vehicular networking.  Finally, this document addresses discussions
   including the summary and analysis of vehicular networking aspects,
   raising deployment issues in road environments.

   Based on the use cases, survey, and problem statement of this
   document, we can specify the requirements for vehicular networks for
   the intended purposes, such as the driving safety, driving
   efficiency, and entertainment.  As a consequence, this will make it
   possible to design a network architecture and protocols for vehicular
   networking.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following definitions:

   o  Road-Side Unit (RSU): A node that has Dedicated Short-Range
      Communications (DSRC) device for wireless communications with
      vehicles and is also connected to the Internet as a router or
      switch for packet forwarding.  An RSU is deployed either at an
      intersection or in a road segment.

   o  On-Board Unit (OBU): A node that has a DSRC device for wireless
      communications with other OBUs and RSUs.  An OBU is mounted on a
      vehicle.  It is assumed that a radio navigation receiver (e.g.,

Internet-Draft        IP-based Vehicular Networking        November 2017


      Global Positioning System (GPS)) is included in a vehicle with an
      OBU for efficient navigation.

   o  Vehicle Detection Loop (or Loop Detector): An inductive device
      used for detecting vehicles passing or arriving at a certain
      point, for instance approaching a traffic light or in motorway
      traffic.  The relatively crude nature of the loop's structure
      means that only metal masses above a certain size are capable of
      triggering the detection.

   o  Traffic Control Center (TCC): A node that maintains road
      infrastructure information (e.g., RSUs, traffic signals, and loop
      detectors), vehicular traffic statistics (e.g., average vehicle
      speed and vehicle inter-arrival time per road segment), and
      vehicle information (e.g., a vehicle's identifier, position,
      direction, speed, and trajectory as a navigation path).  TCC is
      included in a vehicular cloud for vehicular networks.  Example
      functions of TCC include the management of evacuation routes, the
      monitoring of real-time mass transit operations, and real-time
      responsive traffic signal systems.  Thus, TCC is the nerve center
      of most freeway management sytems such that data is collected,
      processed, and fused with other operational and control data, and
      is also synthesized to produce "information" distributed to
      stakeholders, other agencies, and traveling public.  TCC is called
      Traffic Management Center (TMC) in the US.  TCC can communicate
      with road infrastructure nodes (e.g., RSUs, traffic signals, and
      loop detectors) to share measurement data and management
      information by an application-layer protocol.

3.  Use Cases

   This section provides use cases of V2V and V2I networking.

3.1.  V2I Use Cases

   The use cases of V2I networking include navigation service, fuel-
   efficient speed recommendation service, and accident notification
   service.

   A navigation service, such as the Self-Adaptive Interactive
   Navigation Tool (called SAINT) [SAINT], using V2I networking
   interacts with TCC for the global road traffic optimization and can
   guide individual vehicles for appropriate navigation paths in real
   time.  The enhanced SAINT (called SAINT+) [SAINTplus] can give the
   fast moving paths for emergency vehicles (e.g., ambulance and fire

   engine) toward accident spots while providing other vehicles with
   efficient detour paths.

   The emergency communication between accident vehicles (or emergency
   vehicles) and TCC can be performed via either RSU or 4G-LTE networks.
   The First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) [FirstNet] is
   provided by the US government to establish, operate, and maintain an
   interoperable public safety broadband network for safety and security
   network services, such as emergency calls.  The construction of the
   nationwide FirstNet network requires each state in the US to have a
   Radio Access Network (RAN) that will connect to FirstNet's network
   core.  The current RAN is mainly constructed by 4G-LTE, but DSRC-
   based vehicular networks can be used in near future.

   A pedestrian protection service, such as Safety-Aware Navigation
   Application (called SANA) [SANA], using V2I networking can reduce the
   collision of a pedestrian and a vehicle, which have a smartphone, in
   a road network.  Vehicles and pedestrians can communicate with each
   other via an RSU that delivers scheduling information for wireless
   communication to save the smartphones' battery.

3.2.  V2V Use Cases

   The use cases of V2V networking include context-aware navigation for
   driving safety, cooperative adaptive cruise control in an urban
   roadway, and platooning in a highway.  These three techniques will be
   important elements for self-driving vehicles.

   Context-Aware Safety Driving (CASD) navigator [CASD] can help drivers
   to drive safely by letting the drivers recognize dangerous obstacles
   and situations.  That is, CASD navigator displays obstables or
   neighboring vehicles relevant to possible collisions in real-time
   through V2V networking.  CASD provides vehicles with a class-based
   automatic safety action plan, which considers three situations, such
   as the Line-of-Sight unsafe, Non-Line-of-Sight unsafe and safe
   situations.  This action plan can be performed among vehicles through
   V2V networking.

   Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) [CA-Cuise-Control] helps
   vehicles to adapt their speed autonomously through V2V communication
   among vehicles according to the mobility of their predecessor and
   successor vehicles in an urban roadway or a highway.  CACC can help
   adjacent vehicles to efficiently adjust their speed in a cascade way
   through V2V networking.

   Platooning [Truck-Platooning] allows a series of vehicles (e.g.,
   trucks) to move together with a very short inter-distance.  Trucks
   can use V2V communication in addition to forward sensors in order to

Internet-Draft        IP-based Vehicular Networking        November 2017


   maintain constant clearance between two consecutive vehicles at very
   short gaps (from 3 meters to 10 meters).  This platooning can
   maximize the throughput of vehicular traffic in a highway and reduce
   the gas consumption because the leading vehicle can help the
   following vehicles to experience less air resistance.

4.  Vehicular Network Architectures

   This section surveys vehicular network architectures based on IP
   along with various radio technologies, and then discusses problem
   statement for a vehicular network architecture for IP-based vehicular
   networking.

4.1.  Existing Architectures

4.1.1.  VIP-WAVE: IP in 802.11p Vehicular Networks

   Cespedes et al. proposed a vehicular IP in WAVE called VIP-WAVE for
   I2V and V2I networking [VIP-WAVE].  IEEE 1609.3 specified a WAVE
   stack of protocols and includes IPv6 as a network layer protocol in
   data plane [WAVE-1609.3].  The standard WAVE does not support
   Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) of IPv6 Stateless Address
   Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) [RFC4862] due to its own efficient IP
   address configuration based on a WAVE Service Advertisement (WSA)
   management frame [WAVE-1609.3], seamless communications for Internet
   services, and multi-hop communications between a vehicle and an
   infrastructure node (e.g., RSU).  To overcome these limitations of
   the standard WAVE for IP-based networking, VIP-WAVE enhances the
   standard WAVE by the following three schemes: (i) an efficient
   mechanism for the IPv6 address assignment and DAD, (ii) on-demand IP
   mobility based on Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), and (iii) one-hop and
   two-hop communications for I2V and V2I networking.

   In WAVE, IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol is not recommended due
   to the overhead of ND against the timely and prompt communications in
   vehicular networking.  By WAVE service advertisement (WAS) management
   frame, an RSU can provide vehicles with IP configuration information
   (e.g., IPv6 prefix, prefix length, gateway, router lifetime, and DNS
   server) without using ND.  However, WAVE devices may support
   readdressing to provide pseudonymity, so a MAC address of a vehicle
   may be changed or randomly generated.  This update of the MAC address
   may lead to the collision of an IPv6 address based on a MAC address,
   so VIP-WAVE includes a light-weight, on-demand ND to perform DAD.

   For IP-based Internet services, VIP-WAVE adopts PMIPv6 for network-
   based mobility management in vehicular networks.  In VIP-WAVE, RSU
   plays a role of mobile anchor gateway (MAG) of PMIPv6, which performs
   the detection of a vehicle as a mobile node in a PMIPv6 domain and



Jeong                     Expires May 17, 2018                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        IP-based Vehicular Networking        November 2017


   registers it into the PMIPv6 domain.  For PMIPv6 operations, VIP-WAVE
   requires a central node called local mobility anchor (LMA), which
   assigns IPv6 prefixes to vehicles as mobile nodes and forwards data
   packets to the vehicles moving in the coverage of RSUs under its
   control through tunnels between MAGs and itself.

   For two-hop communications between a vehicle and an RSU, VIP-WAVE
   allows an intermediate vehicle between the vehicle and the RSU to
   play a role of a packet relay for the vehicle.  When it becomes out
   of the communication range of an RSU, a vehicle searches for another
   vehicle as a packet relay by sending a relay service announcement.
   When it receives this relay service announcement and is within the
   communication range of an RSU, another vehicle registers itself into
   the RSU as a relay and notifies the relay-requester vehicle of a
   relay maintenance announcement.

   Thus, VIP-WAVE is a good candidate for I2V and V2I networking,
   supporting an enhanced ND, handover, and two-hop communications
   through a relay.

4.1.2.  IPv6 Operation for WAVE

   Baccelli et al. provided an analysis of the operation of IPv6 as it
   has been described by the IEEE WAVE standards 1609 [IPv6-WAVE].
   Although the main focus of WAVE has been the timely delivery of
   safety related information, the deployment of IP-based entertainment
   applications is also considered.  Thus, in order to support
   entertainment traffic, WAVE supports IPv6 and transport protocols
   such as TCP and UDP.

   In the analysis provided in [IPv6-WAVE], it is identified that the
   IEEE 1609.3 standard's recommendations for IPv6 operation over WAVE
   are rather minimal.  Protocols on which the operation of IPv6 relies
   for IP address configuration and IP-to-link-layer address translation
   (e.g., IPv6 ND protocol) are not recommended in the standard.
   Additionally, IPv6 implementations work under certain assumptions for
   the link model that do not necessarily hold in WAVE.  For instance,
   some IPv6 implementations assume symmetry in the connectivity among
   neighboring interfaces.  However, interference and different levels
   of transmission power may cause unidirectional links to appear in a
   WAVE link model.  Also, in an IPv6 link, it is assumed that all
   interfaces which are configured with the same subnet prefix are on
   the same IP link.  Hence, there is a relationship between link and
   prefix, besides the different scopes that are expected from the link-
   local and global types of IPv6 addresses.  Such a relationship does
   not hold in a WAVE link model due to node mobility and highly dynamic
   topology.

Internet-Draft        IP-based Vehicular Networking        November 2017


   Baccelli et al. concluded that the use of the standard IPv6 protocol
   stack, as the IEEE 1609 family of specifications stipulate, is not
   sufficient.  Instead, the addressing assignment should follow
   considerations for ad-hoc link models, defined in [RFC5889], which
   are similar to the characteristics of the WAVE link model.  In terms
   of the supporting protocols for IPv6, such as ND, DHCP, or stateless
   auto-configuration, which rely largely on multicast, do not operate
   as expected in the case where the WAVE link model does not have the
   same behavior expected for multicast IPv6 traffic due to nodes'
   mobility and link variability.  Additional challenges such as the
   support of pseudonimity through MAC address change along with the
   suitability of traditional TCP applications are discussed by the
   authors since those challenges require the design of appropriate
   solutions.

4.1.3.  Multicast Framework for Vehicular Networks

   Jemaa et al. presented a framework that enables deploying multicast
   services for vehicular networks in Infrastructure-based scenarios
   [VNET-Framework].  This framework deals with two phases: (i)
   Initialization or bootstrapping phase that includes a geographic
   multicast auto-configuration process and a group membership building
   method and (ii) Multicast traffic dissemination phase that includes a
   network selecting mechanism on the transmission side and a receiver-
   based multicast delivery in the reception side.  To this end, the
   authors define a distributed mechanism that allows the vehicles to
   configure a common multicast address: Geographic Multicast Address
   Auto-configuration (GMAA), which allows a vehicle to configure its
   own address without signaling.  A vehicle may also be able to change
   the multicast address to which it is subscribed when it changes its
   location.

   This framework suggests a network selecting approach that allows IP
   and non-IP multicast data delivery on the sender side.  Then, to meet
   the challenges of multicast address auto-configuration, the authors
   propose a distributed geographic multicast auto-addressing mechanism
   for multicast groups of vehicles, and a simple multicast data
   delivery scheme in hybrid networks from a server to the group of
   moving vehicles.  However, the GMAA study lacks simulations related
   to performance assessment.

4.1.4.  Joint IP Networking and Radio Architecture

   Petrescu et al. defined the joint IP networking and radio
   architecture for V2V and V2I communication in [Joint-IP-Networking].
   The paper proposes to consider an IP topology in a similar way as a
   radio link topology, in the sense that an IP subnet would correspond
   to the range of 1-hop vehicular communication.  The paper defines

   three types of vehicles: Leaf Vehicle (LV), Range Extending Vehicle
   (REV), and Internet Vehicle (IV).  The first class corresponds to the
   largest set of communicating vehicles (or network nodes within a
   vehicle), while the role of the second class is to build an IP relay
   between two IP-subnet and two sub-IP networks.  Finally, the last
   class corresponds to vehicles being connected to Internet.  Based on
   these three classes, the paper defines six types of IP topologies
   corresponding to V2V communication between two LVs in direct range,
   or two LVs over a range extending vehicle, or V2I communication again
   either directly via an IV, via another vehicles being IV, or via an
   REV connecting to an IV.

   Consider a simplified example of a vehicular train, where LV would be
   in-wagon communicating nodes, REV would be inter-wagon relays, and IV
   would be one node (e.g., train head) connected to Internet.  Petrescu
   et al. defined the required mechanisms to build subnetworks, and
   evaluated the protocol time that is required to build such networks.
   Although no simulation-based evaluation is conducted, the initial
   analysis shows a long initial connection overhead, which should be
   alleviated once the multi-wagon remains stable.  However, this
   approach does not describe what would happen in the case of a dynamic
   multi-hop vehicular network, where such overhead would end up being
   too high for V2V/V2I IP-based vehicular applications.

   One other aspect described in their paper is to join the IP-layer
   relaying with radio-link channels.  Their paper proposes separating
   different subnetworks in different WiFi/ITS-G5 channels, which could
   be advertised by the REV.  Accordingly, the overall interference
   could be controlled within each subnetwork.  This approach is similar
   to multi-channel topology management proposals in multi-hop sensor
   networks, yet adapted to an IP topology.

   Their paper concludes that the generally complex multi-hop IP
   vehicular topology could be represented by only six different
   topologies, which could be further analyzed and optimized.  A prefix
   dissemination protocol is proposed for one of the topologies.

4.1.5.  Mobile Internet Access in FleetNet

   Bechler et al. described the FleetNet project approach to integrate
   Internet Access in future vehicular networks [FleetNet].  The
   FleetNet paper is probably one of the first papers to address this
   aspect, and in many ways, introduces concepts that will be later used
   in MIPv6 or other subsequent IP mobility management schemes.  The
   paper describes a V2I architecture consisting of Vehicles, Internet
   Gateways (IGW), Proxy, and Corresponding Nodes (CN).  Considering
   that vehicular networks are required to use IPv6 addresses and also
   the new wireless access technology ITS-G5 (new at that time), one of

Internet-Draft        IP-based Vehicular Networking        November 2017


   the challenges is to bridge the two different networks (i.e., VANET
   and IPv4/IPv6 Internet).  Accordingly, the paper introduces a
   Fleetnet Gateway (FGW), which allows vehicles in IPv6 to access the
   IPv4 Internet and to bridge two types of networks and radio access
   technologies.  Another challenge is to keep the active addressing and
   flows while vehicles move between FGWs.  Accordingly, the paper
   introduces a proxy node, a hybrid MIP Home Agent, which can re-route
   flows to the new FGW as well as acting as a local IPv4-IPv6 NAT.

   The authors from the paper mostly observed two issues that VANET
   brings into the traditional IP mobility.  First, VANET vehicles must
   mostly be addressed from the Internet directly, and do not
   specifically have a Home Network.  Accordingly, VANET vehicles
   require a globally (predefined) unique IPv6 address, while an IPv6
   co-located care-of address (CCoA) is a newly allocated IPv6 address
   every time a vehicle would enter a new IGW radio range.  Second,
   VANET links are known to be unreliable and short, and the extensive
   use of IP tunneling on-the-air was judged not efficient.
   Accordingly, the first major architecture innovation proposed in this
   paper is to re-introduce a foreign agent (FA) in MIP located at the
   IGW, so that the IP-tunneling would be kept in the back-end (between
   a Proxy and an IGW) and not on the air.  Second, the proxy has been
   extended to build an IP tunnel and be connected to the right FA/IWG
   for an IP flow using a global IPv6 address.

   This is a pioneer paper, which contributed to changing MIP and led to
   the new IPv6 architecture currently known as Proxy-MIP and the
   subsequent DMM-PMIP.  Three key messages can be yet kept in mind.
   First, unlike the Internet, vehicles can be more prominently directly
   addressed than the Internet traffic, and do not have a Home Network
   in the traditional MIP sense.  Second, IP tunneling should be avoided
   as much as possible over the air.  Third, the protocol-based mobility
   (induced by the physical mobility) must be kept hidden to both the
   vehicle and the correspondent node (CN).

4.1.6.  A Layered Architecture for Vehicular DTNs

   Soares et al. addressed the case of delay tolerant vehicular network
   [Vehicular-DTN].  For delay tolerant or disruption tolerant networks,
   rather than building a complex VANET-IP multi-hop route, vehicles may
   also be used to carry packets closer to the destination or directly
   to the destination.  The authors built the well-accepted DTN Bundle
   architecture and protocol to propose a VANET extension.  They
   introduced three types of VANET nodes: (i) terminal nodes (requiring
   data), (ii) mobile nodes (carrying data along their routes), and
   (iii) relay nodes (storing data at cross-roads of mobile nodes as
   data hotspot).

Internet-Draft        IP-based Vehicular Networking        November 2017


   The major innovation in this paper is to propose a DTN VANET
   architecture separating a Control plane and a Data plane.  The
   authors claimed it to be designed to allow full freedom to select the
   most appropriate technology, as well as allow to use out-of-band
   communication for small Control plane packets and use DTN in-band for
   the Data plane.  The paper then further describes the different
   layers from the Control and the Data planes.  One interesting aspect
   is the positioning of the Bundle layer between L2 and L3, rather than
   above TCP/IP as for the DTN Bundle architecture.  The authors claimed
   this to be required first to keep bundle aggregation/disaggregation
   transparent to IP, as well as to allow bundle transmission over
   multiple access technologies (described as MAC/PHY layers in the
   paper).

   Although DTN architectures have evolved since the paper was written,
   the Vehicular-DTN paper takes a different approach to IP mobility
   management.  An important aspect is to separate the Control plane
   from the Data plane to allow a large flexibility in a Control plane
   to coordinate a heterogeneous radio access technology (RAT) Data
   plane.

4.2.  V2I and V2V Internetworking Problem Statement

   This section provides a problem statement of a vehicular network
   architecture of IPv6-based V2I and V2V networking.  The main focus in
   this document is one-hop networking between a vehicle and an RSU or
   between two neighboring vehicles.  However, this document does not
   address all multi-hop networking scenarios of vehicles and RSUs.
   Also, the focus is on the network layer (i.e., IPv6 protocol stack)
   rather than the MAC layer and the transport layer (e.g., TCP, UDP,
   and SCTP).

   Figure 1 shows an architecture for V2I and V2V networking in a road
   network.  The two RSUs (RSU1 and RSU2) are deployed in the road
   network and are connected to a Vehicular Cloud through the Internet.
   TCC is connected to the Vehicular Cloud and the two vehicles
   (Vehicle1 and Vehicle2) are wirelessly connected to RSU1, and the
   last vehicle (Vehicle3) is wirelessly connected to RSU2.  Vehicle1
   can communicate with Vehicle2 via V2V communication, and Vehicle2 can
   communicate with Vehicle3 via V2V communication.  Vehicle1 can
   communicate with Vehicle3 via RSU1 and RSU2 via V2I communication.

   Figure 1: A Vehicular Network Architecture for V2I and V2V Networking

   In vehicular networks, unidirectional links exist and must be
   considered.  The control plane must be separated from data plane.
   ID/Pseudonym change requires a lightweight DAD.  IP tunneling should
   be avoided.  The mobility information of a mobile device (e.g.,
   vehicle), such as trajectory, position, speed, and direction, can be
   used by the mobile device and infrastructure nodes (e.g., TCC and
   RSU) for the accommodation of proactive protocols because it is
   usually equipped with a GPS receiver.  Vehicles can use the TCC as
   its Home Network, so the TCC maintains the mobility information of
   vehicles for location management.  A vehicular network architecture
   may be composed of three types of vehicles in Figure 1: Leaf Vehicle,
   Range Extending Vehicle, and Internet Vehicle[Joint-IP-Networking].

   This section also discusses the internetworking between a vehicle's
   moving network and an RSU's fixed network.

4.2.1.  V2I-based Internetworking

   As shown in Figure 2, the vehicle's moving network and the RSU's
   fixed network are self-contained networks having multiple subnets and
   having an edge router for the communication with another vehicle or
   RSU.  The method of prefix assignment for each subnet inside the

   vehicle's mobile network and the RSU's fixed network is out of scope
   for this document.  Internetworking between two internal networks via
   either V2I or V2V communication requires an exchange of network
   prefix and other parameters.

   The network parameter discovery collects networking information for
   an IP communication between a vehicle and an RSU or between two
   neighboring vehicles, such as link layer, MAC layer, and IP layer
   information.  The link layer information includes wireless link layer
   parameters, such as wireless media (e.g., IEEE 802.11 OCB, LTE D2D,
   Bluetooth, and LiFi) and a transmission power level.  The MAC layer
   information includes the MAC address of an external network interface
   for the internetworking with another vehicle or RSU.  The IP layer
   information includes the IP address and prefix of an external network
   interface for the internetworking with another vehicle or RSU.

   to enable name resolution for hosts or servers residing either in the
   vehicle's moving network or the RSU's fixed network.

   Figure 2 shows internetworking between the vehicle's moving network
   and the RSU's fixed network.  There exists an internal network
   (Moving Network1) inside Vehicle1.  Vehicle1 has the DNS Server
   (RDNSS1), the two hosts (Host1 and Host2), and the two routers
   (Router1 and Router2).  There exists another internal network (Fixed
   Network1) inside RSU1.  RSU1 has the DNS Server (RDNSS2), one host
   (Host3), the two routers (Router3 and Router4), and the collection of
   servers (Server1 to ServerN) for various services in the road
   networks, such as the emergency notification and navigation.
   Vehicle1's Router1 (called mobile router) and RSU1's Router3 (called
   fixed router) use 2001:DB8:1:1::/64 for an external link (e.g., DSRC)
   for I2V networking.

   This document addresses the internetworking between the vehicle's
   moving network and the RSU's fixed network in Figure 2 and the
   required enhancement of IPv6 protocol suite for the V2I networking.

   enhancement of IPv6 protocol suite for the V2V networking.

5.  Standardization Activities

   This section surveys standard activities for vehicular networks in
   standards developing organizations.

5.1.  IEEE Guide for WAVE - Architecture

   IEEE 1609 is a suite of standards for Wireless Access in Vehicular
   Environments (WAVE) developed in the IEEE Vehicular Technology
   Society (VTS).  They define an architecture and a complementary
   standardized set of services and interfaces that collectively enable
   secure vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I)
   wireless communications.

   IEEE 1609.0 provides a description of the WAVE system architecture
   and operations (called WAVE reference model) [WAVE-1609.0].  The
   reference model of a typical WAVE device includes two data plane
   protocol stacks (sharing a common lower stack at the data link and
   physical layers): (i) the standard Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)
   and (ii) the WAVE Short Message Protocol (WSMP) designed for
   optimized operation in a wireless vehicular environment.  WAVE Short
   Messages (WSM) may be sent on any channel.  IP traffic is only
   allowed on service channels (SCHs), so as to offload high-volume IP
   traffic from the control channel (CCH).

   The Layer 2 protocol stack distinguishes between the two upper stacks
   by the Ethertype field.  Ethertype is a 2-octet field in the Logical

   Link Control (LLC) header, used to identify the networking protocol
   to be employed above the LLC protocol.  In particular, it specifies
   the use of two Ethertype values (i.e., two networking protocols),
   such as IPv6 and WSMP.

   Regarding the upper layers, while WAVE communications use standard
   port numbers for IPv6-based protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP), they use a
   Provider Service Identifier (PSID) as an identifier in the context of
   WSMP.

5.2.  IEEE Standard for WAVE - Networking Services

   IEEE 1609.3 defines services operating at the network and transport
   layers, in support of wireless connectivity among vehicle-based
   devices, and between fixed roadside devices and vehicle-based devices
   using the 5.9 GHz Dedicated Short-Range Communications/Wireless
   Access in Vehicular Environments (DSRC/WAVE) mode [WAVE-1609.3].

   WAVE Networking Services represent layer 3 (networking) and layer 4
   (transport) of the OSI communications stack.  The purpose is then to
   provide addressing and routing services within a WAVE system,
   enabling multiple stacks of upper layers above WAVE Networking
   Services and multiple lower layers beneath WAVE Networking Services.
   Upper layer support includes in-vehicle applications offering safety
   and convenience to users.

   The WAVE standards support IPv6.  IPv6 was selected over IPv4 because
   IPv6 is expected to be a viable protocol into the foreseeable future.
   Although not described in the WAVE standards, IPv4 has been tunnelled
   over IPv6 in some WAVE trials.

   The document provides requirements for IPv6 configuration, in
   particular for the address setting.  It specifies the details of the
   different service primitives, among which is the WAVE Routing
   Advertisement (WRA), part of the WAVE Service Advertisement (WSA).
   When present, the WRA provides information about infrastructure
   internetwork connectivity, allowing receiving devices to be
   configured to participate in the advertised IPv6 network.  For
   example, an RSU can broadcast in the WRA portion of its WSA all the
   information necessary for an OBU to access an application-service
   available over IPv6 through the RSU as a router.  This feature
   removes the need for IPv6 Router Advertisement messages, which are
   based on ICMPv6.

5.3.  ETSI Intelligent Transport Systems: GeoNetwork-IPv6

   ETSI published a standard specifying the transmission of IPv6 packets
   over the ETSI GeoNetworking (GN) protocol [ETSI-GeoNetworking]
   [ETSI-GeoNetwork-IP].  IPv6 packet transmission over GN is defined in
   ETSI EN 302 636-6-1 [ETSI-GeoNetwork-IP] using a protocol adaptation
   sub-layer called "GeoNetworking to IPv6 Adaptation Sub-Layer
   (GN6ASL)".  It enables an ITS station (ITS-S) running the GN protocol
   and an IPv6-compliant protocol layer to: (i) exchange IPv6 packets
   with other ITS-S; (ii) acquire globally routable IPv6 unicast
   addresses and communicate with any IPv6 host located in the Internet
   by having the direct connectivity to the Internet or via other relay
   ITS stations; (iii) perform operations as a Mobile Router for network
   mobility [RFC3963].

   The document introduces three types of virtual link, the first one
   providing symmetric reachability by means of stable geographically
   scoped boundaries and two others that can be used when the dynamic
   definition of the broadcast domain is required.  The combination of
   these three types of virtual link in the same station allows running
   the IPv6 ND protocol including SLAAC [RFC4862] as well as
   distributing other IPv6 link-local multicast traffic and, at the same
   time, reaching nodes that are outside specific geographic boundaries.
   The IPv6 virtual link types are provided by the GN6ASL to IPv6 in the
   form of virtual network interfaces.

   The document also describes how to support bridging on top of the
   GN6ASL, how IPv6 packets are encapsulated in GN packets and
   delivered, as well as the support of IPv6 multicast and anycast
   traffic, and neighbor discovery.  For latency reasons, the standard
   strongly recommends to use SLAAC for the address configuration.

   Finally, the document includes the required operations to support the
   change of pseudonym, e.g., changing IPv6 addresses when the GN
   address is changed, in order to prevent attackers from tracking the
   ITS-S.

5.4.  ISO Intelligent Transport Systems: IPv6 over CALM

   ISO published a standard specifying the IPv6 network protocols and
   services for Communications Access for Land Mobiles (CALM)
   [ISO-ITS-IPv6].  These services are necessary to support the global
   reachability of ITS-S, the continuous Internet connectivity for ITS-
   S, and the handover functionality required to maintain such
   connectivity.  This functionality also allows legacy devices to
   effectively use an ITS-S as an access router to connect to the
   Internet.  Essentially, this specification describes how IPv6 is

   configured to support ITS-S and provides the associated management
   functionality.

   The requirements apply to all types of nodes implementing IPv6:
   personal, vehicle, roadside, or central node.  The standard defines
   IPv6 functional modules that are necessary in an IPv6 ITS-S, covering
   IPv6 forwarding, interface between IPv6 and lower layers (e.g., LAN
   interface), mobility management, and IPv6 security.  It defines the
   mechanisms to be used to configure the IPv6 address for static nodes
   as well as for mobile nodes, while maintaining reachability from the
   Internet.

6.  IP Address Autoconfiguration

   This section surveys IP address autoconfiguration schemes for
   vehicular networks, and then discusses problem statement for IP
   addressing and address autoconfiguration for vehicular networking.

6.1.  Existing Protocols for Address Autoconfiguration

6.1.1.  Automatic IP Address Configuration in VANETs

   Fazio et al. proposed a vehicular address configuration called VAC
   for automatic IP address configuration in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks
   (VANET) [Address-Autoconf].  VAC uses a distributed dynamic host
   configuration protocol (DHCP).  This scheme uses a leader playing a
   role of a DHCP server within a cluster having connected vehicles
   within a VANET.  In a connected VANET, vehicles are connected with
   each other within communication range.  In this VANET, VAC
   dynamically elects a leader-vehicle to quickly provide vehicles with
   unique IP addresses.  The leader-vehicle maintains updated
   information on configured addresses in its connected VANET.  It aims
   at the reduction of the frequency of IP address reconfiguration due
   to mobility.

   VAC defines "SCOPE" to be a delimited geographic area within which IP
   addresses are guaranteed to be unique.  When a vehicle is allocated
   an IP address from a leader-vehicle with a scope, it is guaranteed to
   have a unique IP address while moving within the scope of the leader-
   vehicle.  If it moves out of the scope of the leader vehicle, it
   needs to ask for another IP address from another leader-vehicle so
   that its IP address can be unique within the scope of the new leader-
   vehicle.  This approach may allow for less frequent change of an IP
   address than the address allocation from a fixed Internet gateway.

   Thus, VAC can support a feasible address autoconfiguration for V2V
   scenarios, but the overhead to guarantee the uniqueness of IP
   addresses is not ignorable under high-speed mobility.

Internet-Draft        IP-based Vehicular Networking        November 2017


6.1.2.  Using Lane/Position Information

   Kato et al. proposed an IPv6 address assignment scheme using lane and
   position information [Address-Assignment].  In this addressing
   scheme, each lane of a road segment has a unique IPv6 prefix.  When
   it moves in a lane in a road segment, a vehicle autoconfigures its
   IPv6 address with its MAC address and the prefix assigned to the
   lane.  A group of vehicles constructs a connected VANET within the
   same subnet such that their IPv6 addresses have the same prefix.
   Whenever it moves to another lane, a vehicle updates its IPv6 address
   with the prefix corresponding to the new lane and also joins the
   group corresponding to the lane.

   However, this address autoconfiguration scheme may have too much
   overhead when vehicles change their lanes frequently on the highway.

6.1.3.  GeoSAC: Scalable Address Autoconfiguration

   Baldessari et al. proposed an IPv6 scalable address autoconfiguration
   scheme called GeoSAC for vehicular networks [GeoSAC].  GeoSAC uses
   geographic networking concepts such that it combines the standard
   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) and geographic routing functionality.
   It matches geographically-scoped network partitions to individual
   IPv6 multicast-capable links.  In the standard IPv6, all nodes within
   the same link must communicate with each other, but due to the
   characteristics of wireless links, this concept of a link is not
   clear in vehicular networks.  GeoSAC defines a link as a geographic
   area having a network partition.  This geographic area can have a
   connected VANET.  Thus, vehicles within the same VANET in a specific
   geographic area are regarded as staying in the same link, that is, an
   IPv6 multicast link.

   The GeoSAC paper identifies eight key requirements of IPv6 address
   autoconfiguration for vehicular networks: (i) the configuration of
   globally valid addresses, (ii) a low complexity for address
   autoconfiguration, (iii) a minimum signaling overhead of address
   autoconfiguration, (iv) the support of network mobility through
   movement detection, (v) an efficient gateway selection from multiple
   RSUs, (vi) a fully distributed address autoconfiguration for network
   security, (vii) the authentication and integrity of signaling
   messages, and (viii) the privacy protection of vehicles' users.

   To support the proposed link concept, GeoSAC performs ad hoc routing
   for geographic networking in a sub-IP layer called Car-to-Car (C2C)
   NET.  Vehicles within the same link can receive an IPv6 router
   advertisement (RA) message transmitted by an RSU as a router, so they
   can autoconfigure their IPv6 address based on the IPv6 prefix
   contained in the RA and perform Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) to



Jeong                     Expires May 17, 2018                 [Page 20]

Internet-Draft        IP-based Vehicular Networking        November 2017


   verify the uniqueness of the autoconfigured IP address by the help of
   the geographic routing within the link.

   For location-based applications, to translate between a geographic
   area and an IPv6 prefix belonging to an RSU, this paper takes
   advantage of an extended DNS service, using GPS-based addressing and
   routing along with geographic IPv6 prefix format [GeoSAC].

   Thus, GeoSAC can support the IPv6 link concept through geographic
   routing within a specific geographic area.

6.1.4.  Cross-layer Identities Management in ITS Stations

   ITS and vehicular networks are built on the concept of an ITS station
   (ITS-S) (e.g., vehicle and RSU), which is a common reference model
   inspired from the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) standard
   [Identity-Management].  In vehicular networks using multiple access
   network technologies through a cross-layer architecture, a vehicle
   with an OBU may have multiple identities corresponding to the access
   network interfaces.  Wetterwald et al. conducted a comprehensive
   study of the cross-layer identity management in vehicular networks
   using multiple access network technologies, which constitutes a
   fundamental element of the ITS architecture [Identity-Management].

   Besides considerations related to the case where ETSI GeoNetworking
   [ETSI-GeoNetworking] is used, this paper analyzes the major
   requirements and constraints weighing on the identities of ITS
   stations, e.g., privacy and compatibility with safety applications
   and communications.  The concerns related to security and privacy of
   the users need to be addressed for vehicular networking, considering
   all the protocol layers.  In other words, for security and privacy
   constraints to be met, the IPv6 address of a vehicle should be
   derived from a pseudonym-based MAC address and renewed simultaneously
   with that changing MAC address.  By dynamically changing its IPv6
   address, an ITS-S can avoid being tracked by a hacker.  However,
   sometimes this address update cannot be applied; in some situations,
   continuous knowledge about the surrounding vehicles is required.

   Also, the ITS-S Identity Management paper defines a cross-layer
   framework that fulfills the requirements on the identities of ITS
   stations and analyzes systematically, layer by layer, how an ITS
   station can be identified uniquely and safely, whether it is a moving
   station (e.g., car or bus using temporary trusted pseudonyms) or a
   static station (e.g., RSU and central station).  This paper has been
   applied to the specific case of the ETSI GeoNetworking as the network
   layer, but an identical reasoning should be applied to IPv6 over
   802.11 in Outside the Context of a Basic Service Set (OCB) mode now.

6.2.  Problem Statement for IP Address Autoconfiguration

   This section discusses IP addressing for the V2I and V2V networking.
   There are two approaches for IPv6 addressing in vehicular networks.
   The first is to use unique local IPv6 unicast addresses (ULAs) for
   vehicular networks [RFC4193].  The other is to use global IPv6
   addresses for the interoperability with the Internet [RFC4291].  The
   former approach has been used sometimes by Mobile Ad Hoc Networks
   (MANET) for an isolated subnet.  This approach can support the
   emergency notification service and navigation service in road
   networks.  However, for general Internet services (e.g., email
   access, web surfing and entertainment services), the latter approach
   is required.

   For global IP addresses, there are two choices: a multi-link subnet
   approach for multiple RSUs and a single subnet approach per RSU.  In
   the multi-link subnet approach, which is similar to ULA for MANET,
   RSUs play a role of layer-2 (L2) switches and the router
   interconnected with the RSUs is required.  The router maintains the
   location of each vehicle belonging to an RSU for L2 switching.  In
   the single subnet approach per RSU, which is similar to the legacy
   subnet in the Internet, each RSU plays the role of a (layer-3)
   router.

6.2.1.  Neighbor Discovery

   Neighbor Discovery (ND) [RFC4861] is a core part of the IPv6 protocol
   suite.  This section discusses the need for modifying ND for use with
   V2I networking.  The vehicles are moving fast within the
   communication coverage of an RSU.  The external link between the
   vehicle and the RSU can be used for V2I networking, as shown in
   Figure 2.

   ND time-related parameters such as router lifetime and Neighbor
   Advertisement (NA) interval should be adjusted for high-speed
   vehicles and vehicle density.  As vehicles move faster, the NA
   interval should decrease for the NA messages to reach the neighboring
   vehicles promptly.  Also, as vehicle density is higher, the NA
   interval should increase for the NA messages to collide with other NA
   messages with lower collision probability.

6.2.2.  IP Address Autoconfiguration

   This section discusses IP address autoconfiguration for vehicular
   networking.  For IP address autoconfiguration, high-speed vehicles
   should also be considered.  For V2I networking, the legacy IPv6
   stateless address autoconfiguration [RFC4862], as shown in Figure 1,
   may not perform well.  This is because vehicles can travel through



Jeong                     Expires May 17, 2018                 [Page 22]

Internet-Draft        IP-based Vehicular Networking        November 2017


   the communication coverage of the RSU faster than the completion of
   address autoconfiguration (with Router Advertisement and Duplicate
   Address Detection (DAD) procedures).

   To mitigate the impact of vehicle speed on address configuration, the
   RSU can perform IP address autoconfiguration including the DAD
   proactively as an ND proxy on behalf of the vehicles.  If vehicles
   periodically report their movement information (e.g., position,
   trajectory, speed, and direction) to TCC, TCC can coordinate the RSUs
   under its control for the proactive IP address configuration of the
   vehicles with the mobility information of the vehicles.  DHCPv6 (or
   Stateless DHCPv6) can be used for the IP address autoconfiguration
   [RFC3315][RFC3736].

   In the case of a single subnet per RSU, the delay to change IPv6
   address through DHCPv6 procedure is not suitable since vehicles move
   fast.  Some modifications are required for the high-speed vehicles
   that quickly traverses the communication coverages of multiple RSUs.
   Some modifications are required for both stateless address
   autoconfiguration and DHCPv6.  Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) can be used for
   the fast update of a vehicle's care-of address for the current RSU to
   communicate with the vehicle [RFC6275].

   For IP address autoconfiguration in V2V, vehicles can autoconfigure
   their address using prefixes for ULAs for vehicular networks
   [RFC4193].

   High-speed mobility should be considered for a light-overhead address
   autoconfiguration.  A cluster leader can have an IPv6 prefix
   [Address-Autoconf].  Each lane in a road segment can have an IPv6
   prefix [Address-Assignment].  A geographic region under the
   communication range of an RSU can have an IPv6 prefix [GeoSAC].

   IPv6 ND should be extended to support the concept of a link for an
   IPv6 prefix in terms of multicast.  Ad Hoc routing is required for
   the multicast in a connected VANET with the same IPv6 prefix
   [GeoSAC].  A rapid DAD should be supported to prevent or reduce IPv6
   address conflicts.

   In the ETSI GeoNetworking, for the sake of security and privacy, an
   ITS station (e.g., vehicle) can use pseudonyms for its network
   interface identities and the corresponding IPv6 addresses
   [Identity-Management].  For the continuity of an end-to-end transport
   session, the cross-layer identity management has to be performed
   carefully.

7.  Routing

   This section surveys routing in vehicular networks, and then
   discusses problem statement for routing in vehicular networks.

7.1.  Existing Routing Protocols

7.1.1.  Experimental Evaluation for IPv6 over GeoNet

   Tsukada et al. presented a work that aims at combining IPv6
   networking and a Car-to-Car Network routing protocol (called C2CNet)
   proposed by the Car2Car Communication Consortium (C2C-CC), which is
   an architecture using a geographic routing protocol
   [VANET-Geo-Routing].  In the C2C-CC architecture, the C2CNet layer is
   located between IPv6 and link layers.  Thus, an IPv6 packet is
   delivered with an outer C2CNet header, which introduces the challenge
   of how to support the communication types defined in C2CNet in IPv6
   layer.

   The main goal of GeoNet is to enhance the C2C specifications and
   create a prototype software implementation interfacing with IPv6.
   C2CNet is specified in C2C-CC as a geographic routing protocol.

   In order to assess the performance of C2CNet, the authors measured
   the network performance with UDP and ICMPv6 traffic using iperf and
   ping6.  The test results show that IPv6 over C2CNet does not have too
   much delay (less than 4ms with a single hop) and is feasible for
   vehicle communication.  In the outdoor testbed, they developed
   AnaVANET to enable hop-by-hop performance measurement and position
   trace of the vehicles.

   The combination of IPv6 multicast and GeoBroadcast was implemented;
   however, the authors did not evaluate the performance with such a
   scenario.  One of the reasons is that a sufficiently high number of
   receivers are necessary to properly evaluate multicast but
   experimental evaluation is limited in the number of vehicles (4 in
   this study).

7.1.2.  Location-Aided Gateway Advertisement and Discovery

   Abrougui et al. presented a gateway discovery scheme for VANET,
   called Location-Aided Gateway Advertisement and Discovery (LAGAD)
   mechanism[LAGAD].  LAGAD enables vehicles to route packets toward the
   closest gateway quickly by discovering nearby gateways.  The major
   problem that LAGAD tackles is to determine the radius of
   advertisement zone of a gateway, which depends on the location and
   velocity of a vehicle.




Jeong                     Expires May 17, 2018                 [Page 24]

Internet-Draft        IP-based Vehicular Networking        November 2017


   A gateway sends advertisement (GAdv) messages perodically to
   neighboring vehicles.  When receiving a request message from a
   vehicle, the gateway replies to the source vehicle by a gateway reply
   (GRep) message.  The GRep message contains the location information
   of the gateway and the subnet prefix of the gateway by which the
   source vehicle can send data packet via the gateway.  The gateway
   sends GAdv messages through all vehicles within an advertisement zone
   built based on the velocity of the source vehicle.

   The source vehicle starts gateway discovery process by sending
   routing request packets.  The routing request packet is encapsulated
   into a Gateway Reactive Discovery (GRD) packet or a GReq message to
   send to the surrounding vehicles.  The GRD contains both discovery
   and routing information as well as the location and the velocity of
   the source vehicle.  Meanwhile, the intermediate vehicles in an
   advertisement zone of the gateway forward packets sent from the
   source vehicle.  The gateway continuously updates the advertisement
   zone whenever receiving a new data packet from the source vehicle.

7.2.  Routing Problem Statement

   IP address autoconfiguration should be modified to support the
   efficient networking.  Due to network fragmentation, vehicles
   sometimes cannot communicate with each other temporarily.  IPv6 ND
   should consider the temporary network fragmentation.  IPv6 link
   concept can be supported by Geographic routing to connect vehicles
   with the same IPv6 prefix.

   The gateway advertisement and discovery process for routing in VANET
   can probably work when the density of vehicle in a road network is
   not sparse.  A sparse vehicular network challenges the gateway
   discovery since network fragmentation interrupts the discovery
   process.

8.  Mobility Management

   This section surveys mobility management schemes in vehicular
   networks to support handover, and then discusses problem statement
   for mobility management in vehicular networks.

8.1.  Existing Protocols

8.1.1.  Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks with Network Fragmentation

   Chen et al. tackled the issue of network fragmentation in VANET
   environments [IP-Passing-Protocol].  The paper proposes a protocol
   that can postpone the time to release IP addresses to the DHCP server
   and select a faster way to get the vehicle's new IP address, when the



Jeong                     Expires May 17, 2018                 [Page 25]

Internet-Draft        IP-based Vehicular Networking        November 2017


   vehicle density is low or the speeds of vehicles are varied.  In such
   circumstances, the vehicle may not be able to communicate with the
   intended vehicle either directly or through multi-hop relays as a
   consequence of network fragmentation.

   The paper claims that although the existing IP passing and mobility
   solutions may reduce handoff delay, but they cannot work properly on
   VANET especially with network fragmentation.  This is due to the fact
   that messages cannot be transmitted to the intended vehicles.  When
   network fragmentation occurs, it may incur longer handoff latency and
   higher packet loss rate.  The main goal of this study is to improve
   existing works by proposing an IP passing protocol for VANET with
   network fragmentation.

   The paper makes the assumption that on the highway, when a vehicle
   moves to a new subnet, the vehicle will receive broadcast packet from
   the target Base Station (BS), and then perform the handoff procedure.
   The handoff procedure includes two parts, such as the layer-2 handoff
   (new frequency channel) and the layer-3 handover (a new IP address).
   The handoff procedure contains movement detection, DAD procedure, and
   registration.  In the case of IPv6, the DAD procedure is time
   consuming and may cause the link to be disconnected.

   This paper proposes another handoff mechanism.  The handoff procedure
   contains the following phases.  The first is the information
   collecting phase, where each mobile node (vehicle) will broadcast its
   own and its neighboring vehicles' locations, moving speeds, and
   directions periodically.  The remaining phases are, the fast IP
   acquiring phase, the cooperation of vehicle phase, the make before
   break phase, and the route redirection phase.

   Simulations results show that for the proposed protocol, network
   fragmentation ratio incurs less impact.  Vehicle speed and density
   has great impact on the performance of the IP passing protocol
   because vehicle speed and vehicle density will affect network
   fragmentation ratio.  A longer IP lifetime can provide a vehicle with
   more chances to acquire its IP address through IP passing.
   Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can reduce IP
   acquisition time and packet loss rate, so extend IP lifetime with
   extra message overhead.

8.1.2.  Hybrid Centralized-Distributed Mobility Management

   Nguyen et al. proposed a hybrid centralized-distributed mobility
   management called H-DMM to support highly mobile vehicles [H-DMM].
   Legacy mobility management systems are not suitable for high-speed
   scenarios because a registration delay is imposed proportional to the
   distance between a vehicle and its anchor network.  H-DMM is designed



Jeong                     Expires May 17, 2018                 [Page 26]

Internet-Draft        IP-based Vehicular Networking        November 2017


   to satisfy requirements such as service disruption time, end-to-end
   delay, packet delivery cost, and tunneling cost.

   H-DMM proposes a central node called central mobility anchor (CMA),
   which plays the role of a local mobility anchor (LMA) in PMIPv6.
   When it enters a mobile access router (MAR) as an access router, a
   vehicle obtains a prefix from the MAR (called MAR-prefix) according
   to the legacy DMM protocol.  In addition, it obtains another prefix
   from the CMA (called LMA-prefix) for a PMIPv6 domain.  Whenever it
   performs a handover between the subnets for two adjacent MARs, a
   vehicle keeps the LMA-prefix while obtaining a new prefix from the
   new MAR.  For a new data exchange with a new CN, the vehicle can
   select the MAR-prefix or the LMA-prefix for its own source IPv6
   address.  If the number of active prefixes is greater than a
   threshold, the vehicle uses the LMA-prefix-based IPv6 address as its
   source address.  In addition, it can continue receiving data packets
   with the destination IPv6 addresses based on the previous prefixes
   through the legacy DMM protocol.

   Thus, H-DMM can support an efficient tunneling for a high-speed
   vehicle that moves fast across the subnets of two adjacent MARs.
   However, when H-DMM asks a vehicle to perform DAD for the uniqueness
   test of its configured IPv6 address in the subnet of the next MAR,
   the activation of the configured IPv6 address for networking will be
   delayed.  This indicates that a proactive DAD by a network component
   (i.e., MAR and LMA) can shorten the address configuration delay of
   the current DAD triggered by a vehicle.

8.1.3.  Hybrid Architecture for Network Mobility Management

   Nguyen et al. proposed H-NEMO, a hybrid centralized-distributed
   mobility management scheme to handle IP mobility of moving vehicles
   [H-NEMO].  The standard Network Mobility (NEMO) basic support, which
   is a centralized scheme for network mobility, provides IP mobility
   for a group of users in a moving vehicle, but also inherits the
   drawbacks from Mobile IPv6, such as suboptimal routing and signaling
   overhead in nested scenarios as well as reliability and scalability
   issues.  On the contrary, distributed schemes such as the recently
   proposed Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) locates the mobility
   anchor at the network edge and enables mobility support only to
   traffic flows that require such support.  However, in high speed
   moving vehicles, DMM may suffer from high signaling cost and high
   handover latency.

   The proposed H-NEMO architecture is not designed for a specific
   wireless technology.  Instead, it defines a general architecture and
   signaling protocol so that a mobile node can obtain mobility from
   fixed locations or mobile platforms, and also allows the use of DMM

   or Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), depending on flow characteristics and
   mobility patterns of the node.  For IP addressing allocation, a
   mobile router (MR) or the mobile node (MN) connected to an MR in a
   NEMO obtain two sets of prefixes: one from the central mobility
   anchor and one from the mobile access router (MAR).  In this way, the
   MR/MN may choose a more stable prefix for long-lived flows to be
   routed via the central mobility anchor and the MAR-prefix for short-
   lived flows to be routed following the DMM concept.  The multi-hop
   scenario is considered under the concept of a nested-NEMO.

   Nguyen et al. did not provide simulation-based evaluations, but they
   provided an analytical evaluation that considered signaling and
   packet delivery costs, and showed that H-NEMO outperforms the
   previous proposals, which are either centralized or distributed ones
   with NEMO support.  For some measures, such as the signaling cost,
   H-NEMO may be more costly than centralized schemes when the velocity
   of the node is increasing, but behaves better in terms of packet
   delivery cost and handover delay.

8.1.4.  NEMO-Enabled Localized Mobility Support

   In [NEMO-LMS], the authors proposed an architecture to enable IP
   mobility for moving networks using a network-based mobility scheme
   based on PMIPv6.  In PMIPv6, only mobile terminals are provided with
   IP mobility.  In contrast to from host-based mobility, PMIPv6 shifts
   the signaling to the network side, so that the mobile access gateway
   (MAG) is in charge of detecting connection/disconnection of the
   mobile node, upon which the signaling to the Local Mobility Anchor
   (LMA) is triggered to guarantee a stable IP addressing assignment
   when the mobile node performs handover to a new MAG.

   Soto et al. proposed NEMO support in PMIPv6 (N-PMIP).  In this
   scheme, the functionality of the MAG is extended to the mobile router
   (MR), also called a mobile MAG (mMAG).  The functionality of the
   mobile terminal remains unchanged, but it can receive an IPv6 prefix
   belonging to the PMIPv6 domain through the new functionality of the
   mMAG.  Therefore, in N-PMIP, the mobile terminal connects to the MR
   as if it is connecting to a fixed MAG, and the MR connects to the
   fixed MAG using PMIPv6 signaling.  When the mobile terminal roams to
   a new MAG or a new MR, the network forwards the packets through the
   LMA.  Hence, N-PMIP defines an extended functionality in the LMA that
   enables a recursive lookup.  First, it locates the binding entry
   corresponding to the mMAG.  Next, it locates the entry corresponding
   to the fixed MAG, after which the LMA can encapsulate packets to the
   mMAG to which the mobile terminal is currently connected.

   The performance of N-PMIP was evaluated through simulations and
   compared to a NEMO+MIPv6+PMIPv6 scheme, with better results obtained

   in N-PMIP.  The work did not consider the case of multi-hop
   connectivity in the vehicular scenario.  In addition, since the MR
   should be a trusted entity in the PMIP domain, it requires specific
   security associations that were not addressed in [NEMO-LMS].

8.1.5.  Network Mobility for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks

   Chen et al. proposed a network mobility protocol to reduce handoff
   delay and maintain Internet connectivity to moving vehicles in a
   highway [NEMO-VANET].  In this work, vehicles can acquire IP
   addresses from other vehicles through V2V communications.  At the
   time the vehicle goes out of the coverage of the base station,
   another vehicle may assist the roaming car to acquire a new IP
   address.  Also, cars on the same or opposite lane are authorized to
   assist the vehicle to perform a pre-handoff.

   The authors assumed that the wireless connectivity is provided by
   WiFi and WiMAX access networks.  Also, they considered scenarios in
   which a single vehicle, i.e., a bus, may need two mobile routers in
   order to have an effective pre-handoff procedure.  Evaluations are
   performed through simulations and the comparison schemes are the
   standard NEMO Basic Support protocol and the fast NEMO Basic Support
   protocol.  Authors did not mention applicability of the scheme in
   other scenarios such as in urban transport schemes.

8.1.6.  Performance Analysis of P-NEMO for ITS

   Lee et al. proposed P-NEMO, which is a PMIPv6-based IP mobility
   management scheme to maintain the Internet connectivity at the
   vehicle as a mobile network, and provides a make-before-break
   mechanism when vehicles switch to a new access network
   [PMIP-NEMO-Analysis].  Since the standard PMIPv6 only supports
   mobility for a single node, the solution in [PMIP-NEMO-Analysis]
   adapts the protocol to reduce the signaling when a local network is
   to be served by an in-vehicle mobile router.  To achieve this, P-NEMO
   extends the binding update lists at both MAG and LMA, so that the
   mobile router (MR) can receive a home network prefix (HNP) and a
   mobile network prefix (MNP).  The latter prefix enables mobility for
   the moving network, instead of a single node as in the standard
   PMIPv6.

   An additional feature is proposed by Lee et al. named fast P-NEMO
   (FP-NEMO).  It adopts the fast handover approach standardized for
   PMIPv6 in [RFC5949] with both predictive and reactive modes.  The
   difference of the proposed feature with the standard version is that
   by using the extensions provided by P-NEMO, the predictive
   transferring of the context from the old MAG to the new MAG also
   includes information for the moving network, i.e., the MNP.  In that



Jeong                     Expires May 17, 2018                 [Page 29]

Internet-Draft        IP-based Vehicular Networking        November 2017


   way, mobility support can be achieved not only for the mobile router,
   but also for mobile nodes traveling with the vehicle.

   The performance of P-NEMO and F-NEMO is evaluated through an
   analytical model that is compared only to the standard NEMO-BS.  No
   comparison was provided to other schemes that enable network mobility
   in PMIPv6 domains, such as the one presented in [NEMO-LMS].

8.1.7.  Integration of VANets and Fixed IP Networks

   Peng et al. proposed a novel mobility management scheme for
   integration of VANET and fixed IP networks [VNET-MM].  The proposed
   scheme deals with mobility of vehicles based on a street layout
   instead of a general two dimensional ad hoc network.  This scheme
   makes use of the information provided by vehicular networks to reduce
   mobility management overhead.  It allows multiple base stations that
   are close to a destination vehicle to discover the connection to the
   vehicle simultaneously, which leads to an improvement of the
   connectivity and data delivery ratio without redundant messages.  The
   performance was assessed by using a road traffic simulator called
   SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility).

8.1.8.  SDN-based Mobility Management for 5G Networks

   Nguyen et al. extended their previous works on a vehicular adapted
   DMM considering a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) architecture
   [SDN-DMM].  On one hand, in their previous work, Nguyen et al.
   proposed DMM-PMIP and DMM-MIP architectures for VANET.  The major
   innovation behind DMM is to distribute the Mobility Functions (MFs)
   through the network instead of concentrating them in one bottleneck
   MF, or in a hierarchically organized backbone of MFs.  Highly mobile
   vehicular networks impose frequent IP route optimizations that lead
   to suboptimal routes (detours) between CN and vehicles.  The
   suboptimality critically increases when there are nested or
   hierarchical MF nodes.  Therefore, flattening the IP mobility
   architecture significantly reduces detours, as it is the role of the
   last MF to get the closest next MF (in most cases nearby).  Yet, with
   an MF being distributed throughout the network, a Control plane
   becomes necessary in order to provide a solution for CN to address
   vehicles.  The various solutions developed by Nguyen at al. not only
   showed the large benefit of a DMM approach for IPv6 mobility
   management, but also emphasized the critical role of an efficient
   Control plane.

   One the other hand, SDN has recently gained attention from the
   Internet Networking community due to its capacity to provide a
   significantly higher scalability of highly dynamic flows, which is
   required by future 5G dynamic networks In particular, SDN also

   suggests a strict separation between a Control plane (SDN-Controller)
   and a Data plane (OpenFlow Switches) based on the OpenFlow standard.
   Such an architecture has two advantages that are critical for IP
   mobility management in VANET.  First, unlike traditional routing
   mechanisms, OpenFlow focuses on flows rather than optimized routes.
   Accordingly, they can optimize routing based on flows (grouping
   multiple flows in one route, or allowing one flow to have different
   routes), and can detect broken flows much earlier than the
   traditional networking solutions.  Second, SDN controllers may
   dynamically reprogram (reconfigure) OpenFlow Switches (OFS) to always
   keep an optimal route between CN and a vehicular node.

   Nguyen et. al observed the mutual benefits IPv6 DMM could obtain from
   an SDN architecture, and then proposed an SDN-based DMM for VANET.
   In their proposed architecture, a PMIP-DMM is used, where MF is OFS
   for the Data plane, and one or more SDN controllers handle the
   Control plane.  The evaluation and prototype in the paper prove that
   the proposed architecture can provide a higher scalability than the
   standard DMM.

   The SDN-DMM paper makes several observations leading to a strong
   suggestion that IP mobility management should be based on an SDN
   architecture.  First, SDN will be integrated into future Internet and
   5G in the near future.  Second, after separating the Identity and
   Routing addressing, IP mobility management further requires to
   separate the Control from the Data plane if it needs to remain
   scalable for VANET.  Finally, Flow-based routing (in particular
   OpenFlow standard) will be required in future heterogeneous vehicular
   networks (e.g., multi-RAT and multi-protocol) and the SDN coupled
   with DMM provides a double benefit of dynamic flow detection/
   reconfiguration and short(-er) route optimizations.

8.1.9.  IP Mobility for VANETs: Challenges and Solutions

   Cespedes et al. provided a survey of the challenges for NEMO Basic
   Support for VANET [Vehicular-IP-MM].  NEMO allows the management of a
   group of nodes (a mobile network) rather than a single node.
   However, although a vehicle and even a platoon of vehicles could be
   seen as a group of nodes, NEMO has not been designed considering the
   particularities of VANET.  For example, NEMO builds a tunnel between
   an MR (on board of a vehicle) and its HA, which in a VANET context is
   suboptimal, for instance due to over-the-air tunneling cost.  Also, a
   detour may be taken by the MR's HA, even if the CN is nearby.
   Furthermore, route optimization is needed when the MR moves to a new
   AR.

   Cespedes et al. first summarize the requirements of IP mobility
   management, such as reduced power at end-device, reduced handover



Jeong                     Expires May 17, 2018                 [Page 31]

Internet-Draft        IP-based Vehicular Networking        November 2017


   event, reduced complexity, or reduced bandwidth consumption.  VANET
   adds the following requirements, such as minimum signaling for route
   optimization (RO), per-flow separability, security and binding
   privacy protection, multi-homing, and switching HA.  As observed,
   these provide several challenges to IP mobility and NEMO BS for
   VANET.

   Cespedes et al. then describe various optimization schemes available
   for NEMO BS.  Considering a single hop connection to CN, one major
   optimization direction is to avoid the HA detour and reach the CN
   directly.  In that direction, a few optimizations are proposed, such
   as creating an IP tunnel between the MR and the CR directly, creating
   an IP tunnel between the MR and a CR (rather than the HA), a
   delegation mechanism allowing visiting nodes to use MIPv6 directly
   rather than NEMO or finally intra-NEMO optimization for a direct path
   within NEMO bypassing HAs.

   Specific to VANET, multi-hop connection is possible to the fixed
   network.  In that case, NEMO BS must be enhanced to avoid requiring
   that the path to immediate neighbors must pass by the respective HAs
   instead of directly.  More specifically, two approaches are proposed
   to rely on VANET sub-IP multi-hop routing to hide a NEMO complex
   topology (e.g., Nested NEMO) and provide a direct route between two
   VANET nodes.  Generally, one major challenge is security and privacy
   when opening a multi-hop route between a VANET and a CN.
   Heterogeneous multi-hop in a VANET (e.g., relying on various access
   technologies) corresponds to another challenge for NEMO BS as well.

   Cespedes et al. conclude their paper with an overview of critical
   research challenges, such as Anchor Point location, the optimized
   usage of geographic information at the subIP as well as at the IP
   level to improve NEMO BS, security and privacy, and the addressing
   allocation schema for NEMO.

   In summary, this paper illustrates that NEMO BS for VANET should
   avoid the HA detour as well as opening IP tunnels over the air.
   Also, NEMO BS could use geographic information for subIP routing when
   a direct link between vehicles is required to reach an AR, but also
   anticipate handovers and optimize ROs.  From an addressing
   perspective, dynamic MNP assignments should be preferred, but should
   be secured in particular during binding update (BU).

8.2.  Problem Statement for Mobility-Management

   This section discusses an IP mobility support in V2I networking.  In
   a single subnet per RSU, vehicles continually cross the communication
   coverages of adjacent RSUs.  During this crossing, TCP/UDP sessions
   can be maintained through IP mobility support, such as MIPv6



Jeong                     Expires May 17, 2018                 [Page 32]

   [RFC6275], Proxy MIPv6 [RFC5213][RFC5949], and Distributed Mobility
   Management (DMM) [RFC7333][RFC7429].  Since vehicles move fast along
   roadways, high speed should be enabled by the parameter configuration
   in the IP mobility management.  With the periodic reports of the
   movement information from the vehicles, TCC can coordinate RSUs and
   other network compoments under its control for the proactive mobility
   management of the vehicles along the movement of the vehicles.

   To support the mobility of a vehicle's moving network, Network
   Mobility Basic Support Protocol (NEMO) can be used [RFC3963].  Like
   MIPv6, the high speed of vehicles should be considered for a
   parameter configuration in NEMO.

   Mobility Management (MM) solution design varies, depending on
   scenarios: highway vs. urban roadway.  Hybrid schemes (NEMO + PMIP,
   PMIP + DMM, etc.) usually show better performance than pure schemes.
   Most schemes assume that IP address configuration is already set up.
   Most schemes have been tested only at either simulation or analytical
   level.  SDN can be considered as a player in the MM solution.

9.  DNS Naming Service

   This section surveys and analyzes DNS naming service to translate a
   device's DNS name into the corresponding IP address, and then
   discusses problem statement for DNS naming service in vehicular
   networks.

9.1.  Existing Protocols

9.1.1.  Multicast DNS

   Multicast DNS (mDNS)[RFC6762] allows devices in one-hop communication
   range to resolve each other's DNS name into the corresponding IP
   address in multicast.  Each device has a DNS resolver and a DNS
   server.  The DNS resolver generates a DNS query for the device's
   application and the DNS server responds to a DNS query corresponding
   to its device's DNS name.

9.1.2.  DNS Name Autoconfiguration for IoT Devices

   DNS Name Autoconfiguration (DNSNA) [ID-DNSNA] proposes a DNS naming
   service for Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices in a large-scale
   network.

   The DNS naming service of DNSNA consists of four steps, such as DNS
   name generation, DNS name duplication detection, DNS name
   registration, and DNS name list retrieval.




Jeong                     Expires May 17, 2018                 [Page 33]

Internet-Draft        IP-based Vehicular Networking        November 2017


   First, in DNS name generation, DNSNA allows each IoT device to
   generate its own DNS name with a DNS suffix (acquired from ND or
   DHCP) and its device information (e.g., vendor, model, and serial
   number).

   Second, in DNS name duplication detection, each device checks whether
   its generated DNS name is used by another IoT device in the same
   subnet.

   Third, in DNS name registration, each device registers its DNS name
   and the corresponding IPv6 address into a designated DNS server via a
   router.  The router periodically collects DNS information of IoT
   devices in its the subnets corresponding ot its network interfaces.

   Last, in DNS name list retrieval, a user can retrieve the DNS name
   list of IoT devices available to the user through the designated DNS
   server.  Once the user retrieves the list having a DNS name and the
   corresponding IP address(es), it can monitor and remote-control an
   IoT device.

9.2.  Problem Statement

   The DNS name resolution translates a DNS name into the corresponding
   IPv6 address through a recursive DNS server (RDNSS) within the
   vehicle's moving network and DNS servers in the Internet
   [RFC1034][RFC1035], which are located outside the VANET.  The RDNSSes
   can be advertised by RA DNS Option or DHCP DNS Option into the
   subnets within the vehicle's moving network.

   mDNS is designed for a small ad hoc network with wireless/wired one-
   hop communication range.  If it is used in a vehicle's mobile network
   having multiple subnets, mDNS cannot effectively work in such a
   multi-hop network.  This is because the DNS query message of each DNS
   resolver should be multicasted into the whole mobile network, leading
   to a large volume of DNS traffic.

   DNSNA is designed for a large-scale network with multiple subnets.
   If it is used in a vehicle's mobile network having multiple subnets,
   DNSNA can effectively work in such a multi-hop network.  This is
   because the DNS query message of each DNS resolver should be
   unicasted to the designated DNS server.

   DNSNA allows each host (e.g., in-vehicle device and a user's mobile
   device) within a vehicle's moving network to generate its unique DNS
   name and registers it into a DNS server within the vehicle's moving
   network [ID-DNSNA].  With Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), a
   unique DNS suffix can be constructed as a DNS domain for the

   vehicle's moving network.  Each host can generate its DNS name and
   register it into the local RDNSS in the vehicle's moving network.

10.  Service Discovery

   This section surveys and analyzes service discovery to translate a
   required service into an IP address of a device to provide such a
   service, and then discusses problem statement for service discovery
   in vehicular networks.

10.1.  Existing Protocols

10.1.1.  mDNS-based Service Discovery

   As a popular existing service discovery protocol, DNS-based Service
   Discovery (DNS-SD) [RFC6763] with mDNS [RFC6762] provides service
   discovery.

   DNS-SD uses a DNS service (SRV) resource record (RR) [RFC2782] to
   support the service discovery of services provided by a device or
   server.  An SRV RR contains a service instance name, consisting of an
   instance name (i.e., device), a service name, a transport layer
   protocol, a domain name, the corresponding port number, and the DNS
   name of the device eligible for the requested service.  With this
   DNS-SD, a host can search for a service instance with the SRV RR to
   discover a list of devices corresponding to the searched service
   type.

10.1.2.  ND-based Service Discovery

   Vehicular ND [ID-Vehicular-ND] proposes an extension of IPv6 ND for
   the prefix and service discovery.  Vehicles and RSUs can announce the
   network prefixes and services in their internal network via ND
   messages containing ND options with the prefix and service
   information.  Since it does not need any additional service discovery
   protocol in the application layer, this ND-based approach can provide
   vehicles and RSUs with the rapid discovery of the network prefixes
   and services.

10.2.  Problem Statement

   Vehicles need to discover services (e.g., road condition
   notification, navigation service, and entertainment) provided by
   infrastructure nodes in a fixed network via RSU, as shown in
   Figure 2.  During the passing of an intersection or road segment with
   an RSU, vehicles should perform this service discovery quickly.  For
   these purposes, service discovery should be performed quickly.




Jeong                     Expires May 17, 2018                 [Page 35]

Internet-Draft        IP-based Vehicular Networking        November 2017


   mDNS-based DNS-SD [RFC6762][RFC6763] can be used for service
   discovery between vehicles or between a vehicle and an RSU by using a
   multicast protocol, the service discovery requires a nonnegligible
   service delay due to service discovery.  This is because the service
   discovery message should traverse the mobile network or fixed network
   through multicasting.  This may hinder the prompt service usage of
   the vehicles from the fixed network via RSU.

   One feasible approach is a piggyback service discovery during the
   prefix exchange of network prefixes for the networking between a
   vehicle's moving network and an RSU's fixed network.  That is, the
   message of the prefix exchange can include service information, such
   as each service's IP address, transport layer protocol, and port
   number.  The Vehicular ND [ID-Vehicular-ND] can support this approach
   efficiently.

11.  Security and Privacy

   This section surveys security and privacy in vehicular networks, and
   then discusses problem statement for security and privacy in
   vehicular networks.

11.1.  Existing Protocols

11.1.1.  Securing Vehicular IPv6 Communications

   Fernandez et al. proposed a secure vehicular IPv6 communication
   scheme using Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) and Internet
   Protocol Security (IPsec) [Securing-VCOMM].  This scheme aims at the
   security support for IPv6 Network Mobility (NEMO) for in-vehicle
   devices inside a vehicle via a Mobile Router (MR).  An MR has
   multiple wireless interfaces, such as 3G, IEEE 802.11p, WiFi, and
   WiMAX.  The proposed architecture consists of Vehicle ITS Station
   (Vehicle ITS-S), Roadside ITS Station (Roadside ITS-S), and Central
   ITS Station (Central ITS-S).  Vehicle ITS-S is a vehicle having a
   mobile Network along with an MR.  Roadside ITS-S is an RSU as a
   gateway to connect vehicular networks to the Internet.  Central ITS-S
   is a TCC as a Home Agent (HA) for the location management of vehicles
   having their MR.

   The proposed secure vehicular IPv6 communication scheme sets up IPsec
   secure sessions for control and data traffic between the MR in a
   Vehicle ITS-S and the HA in a Central ITS-S.  Roadside ITS-S plays a
   role of an Access Router (AR) for Vehicle ITS-S's MR to provide the
   Internet connectivity for Vehicle ITS-S via wireless interfaces, such
   as IEEE 802.11p, WiFi, and WiMAX.  In the case where Roadside ITS-S
   is not available to Vehicle ITS-S, Vehicle ITS-S communicates with
   Central ITS-S via cellular networks (e.g., 3G).  The secure

   communication scheme enhances the NEMO protocol that interworks with
   IKEv2 and IPsec in network mobility in vehicular networks.

   The authors implemented their scheme and evaluated its performance in
   a real testbed.  This testbed supports two wireless networks, such as
   IEEE 802.11p and 3G.  The in-vehicle devices (or hosts) in Vehicle
   ITS-S are connected to an MR of Vehicle ITS-S via IEEE 802.11g.  The
   test results show that their scheme supports promising secure IPv6
   communications with a low impact on communication performance.

11.1.2.  Authentication and Access Control

   Moustafa et al. proposed a security scheme providing authentication,
   authorization, and accounting (AAA) services in vehicular networks
   [VNET-AAA].  This secuirty scheme aims at the support of safe and
   reliable data services in vehicular networks.  It authenticates
   vehicles as mobile clients to use the network access and various
   services that are provided by service providers.  Also, it ensures a
   confidential data transfer between communicating parties (e.g.,
   vehicle and infrastructure node) by using IEEE 802.11i (i.e., WPA2)
   for secure layer-2 links.

   The authors proposed a vehicular network architecture consisting of
   three entities, such as Access network, Wireless mobile ad hoc
   networks (MANETs), and Access Points (APs).  Access network is the
   fixed network infrastructure forming the back-end of the
   architecture.  Wireless MANETs are constructed by moving vehicles
   forming the front-end of the architecture.  APs is the IEEE 802.11
   WLAN infrastructure forming the interface between the front-end and
   back-end of the architecture.

   For AAA services, the proposed architecture uses a Kerberos
   authentication model that authenticates vehicles at the entry point
   with the AP and also authorizes them to the access of various
   services.  Since vehicles are authenticated by a Kerberos
   Authentication Server (AS) only once, the proposed security scheme
   can minimize the load on the AS and reduce the delay imposed by layer
   2 using IEEE 802.11i.

11.2.  Problem Statement

   Security and privacy are paramount in the V2I and V2V networking in
   vehicular networks.  Only authorized vehicles should be allowed to
   use the V2I and V2V networking.  Also, in-vehicle devices and mobile
   devices in a vehicle need to communicate with other in-vehicle
   devices and mobile devices in another vehicle, and other servers in
   an RSU in a secure way.

   A Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) and a user certificate along
   with in-vehicle device's identifier generation can be used to
   authenticate a vehicle and the user through a road infrastructure
   node, such as an RSU connected to an authentication server in TCC.
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates can also be used for
   secure vehicle communications.

   For secure V2I communication, the secure channel between a mobile
   router in a vehicle and a fixed router in an RSU should be
   established, as shown in Figure 2.  Also, for secure V2V
   communication, the secure channel between a mobile router in a
   vehicle and a mobile router in another vehicle should be established,
   as shown in Figure 3.

   The security for vehicular networks should provide vehicles with AAA
   services in an efficient way.  It should consider not only horizontal
   handover, but also vertical handover since vehicles have multiple
   wireless interfaces.

   To prevent an adversary from tracking a vehicle by with its MAC
   address or IPv6 address, each vehicle should periodically update its
   MAC address and the corresponding IPv6 address as suggested in
   [RFC4086][RFC4941].  Such an update of the MAC and IPv6 addresses
   should not interrupt the communications between a vehicle and an RSU.

12.  Discussions

12.1.  Summary and Analysis

   This document surveyed state-of-the-arts technologies for IP-based
   vehicular networks, such as IP address autoconfiguration, vehicular
   network architecture, vehicular network routing, and mobility
   management.

   Through this survey, it is learned that IPv6-based vehicular
   networking can be well-aligned with IEEE WAVE standards for various
   vehicular network applications, such as driving safety, efficient
   driving, and entertainment.  However, since the IEEE WAVE standards
   do not recommend to use the IPv6 ND protocol for the communication
   efficiency under high-speed mobility, it is necessary to adapt the ND
   for vehicular networks with such high-speed mobility.

   The concept of a link in IPv6 does not match that of a link in VANET
   because of the physical separation of communication ranges of
   vehicles in a connected VANET.  That is, in a linear topology of
   three vehicles (Vehicle-1, Vehicle-2, and Vehicle-3), Vehicle-1 and
   Vehicle-2 can communicate directly with each other.  Vehicle-2 and
   Vehicle-3 can communicate directly with each other.  However,

   Vehicle-1 and Vehicle-3 cannot communicate directly with each other
   due to the out-of-communication range.  For the link in IPv6, all of
   three vehicles are on a link, so they can communicate directly with
   each other.  On the other hand, in VANET, this on-link communication
   concept is not valid in VANET.  Thus, the IPv6 ND should be extended
   to support this multi-link subnet of a connected VANET through either
   ND proxy or VANET routing.

   For IP-based networking, IP address autoconfiguration is a
   prerequisite function.  Since vehicles can communicate intermittently
   with TCC via RSUs through V2I communications, TCC can play a role of
   a DHCP server to allocate unique IPv6 addresses to the vehicles.
   This centralized address allocation can remove the delay of the DAD
   procedure for testing the uniqueness of IPv6 addresses.

   For routing and mobility management, most of vehicles are equipped
   with a GPS navigator as a dedicated navigation system or a smartphone
   App. With this GPS navigator, vehicles can share their current
   position and trajectory (i.e., navigation path) with TCC.  TCC can
   predict the future positions of the vehicles with their mobility
   information (i.e., the current position, speed, direction, and
   trajectory).  With the prediction of the vehicle mobility, TCC
   supports RSUs to perform data packet routing and handover
   proactively.

12.2.  Deployment Issues

   Some automobile companies (e.g., BMW and Hyundai) started to use
   Ethernet for a vehicle's internal network instead of the traditional
   Contoller Area Network (CAN) for high-speed interconnectivity among
   electronic control units.  With this trend, the IP-based vehicular
   networking in this document will be popular in near future.

   Self-driving technologies are being developed by many automobile
   companies (e.g., Tesla, BMW, GM, Honda, Toyota, and Hyundai) and IT
   companies (e.g., Google and Apple).  Since they require high-speed
   interaction among vehicles, infrastructure nodes (e.g., RSU), and
   cloud, IP-based networking will be mandatory.

   Therefore, key component technologies for the IP-based vehicular
   networking need to be developed for future demands along with an
   efficient vehicular network architecture.

13.  Security Considerations

   Section 11 discusses security and privacy for IP-based vehicular
   networking.

   The security for key components in vehicular networking, such as IP
   address autoconfiguration, routing, mobility management, DNS naming
   service, and service discovery, needs to be analyzed in depth.

Appendix C.  Changes from draft-ietf-ipwave-vehicular-networking-00

   The following changes are made from draft-ietf-ipwave-vehicular-
   networking-00:

   o  In Section 4.2, The mobility information of a mobile device (e.g.,
      vehicle) can be used by the mobile device and infrastructure nodes
      (e.g., TCC and RSU) for enhancing protocol performance.

   o  In Section 4.2, Vehicles can use the TCC as its Home Network, so
      the TCC maintains the mobility information of vehicles for
      location management.

   o  The contents are clarified with typo corrections and rephrasing.
