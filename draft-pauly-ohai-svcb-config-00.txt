1.  Introduction

   Oblivious HTTP [OHTTP] allows clients to encrypt messages exchanged
   with an HTTP server accessed via a proxy, in such a way that the
   proxy cannot inspect the contents of the message and the target HTTP
   server does not discover the client's identity.  In order to use
   Oblivious HTTP, clients need to possess a key configuration to use to
   encrypt messages to the oblivious target.

Internet-Draft          Oblivious Configs in SVCB             March 2022


   Since Oblivious HTTP deployments will often involve very specific
   coordination between clients, proxies, and targets, the key
   configuration can often be shared in a bespoke fashion.  However,
   some deployments involve clients discovering oblivious targets more
   dynamically.  For example, a network may want to advertise a DNS
   resolver that is accessible over Oblivious HTTP and applies local
   network resolution policies via mechanisms like Discovery of
   Designated Resolvers ([DDR].  Clients can work with trusted proxies
   to access these target servers.

   This document defines a mechanism to distribute Oblivious HTTP key
   configurations in DNS records, as a parameter that can be included in
   SVCB and HTTPS DNS resource records [SVCB].  The presence of this
   parameter indicates that a service is an oblivious target; see
   Section 3 of [OHTTP] for a description of oblivious targets.

   This mechanism does not aid in the discovery of proxies to use to
   access oblivious targets; the configurations of proxies is out of
   scope for this document.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  The ohttp-configs and ohttp-path SvcParamKeys

   The "ohttp-configs" SvcParamKey Section 6 is used to convey one or
   more key configurations that can be used by clients to issue
   oblivious requests to a target server described by the SVCB record.

   In wire format, the value of the parameter is one or more KeyConfig
   structures [OHTTP] concatenated together.  In presentation format,
   the value is the same concatenated KeyConfig structures encoded in
   Base64 [BASE64].

   The meaning of the "ohttp-configs" parameter depends on the scheme of
   the SVCB record.  This document defines the interpretation for the
   "https" [SVCB] and "dns" [DNS-SVCB] schemes.  Other schemes that want
   to use this parameter MUST define the interpretation and meaning of
   the configuration.

   The "ohttp-path" SvcParamKey Section 6 is used to convey the URI path
   of the oblivious target to which oblivious HTTP requests can sent.
   In both wire format and presentation format, this is a UTF-8 encoded

   string that contains the path segment of a URI.  If this path
   parameter is not present, oblivious requests can be made to the root
   "/" path.

3.1.  Use in HTTPS service records

   For the "https" scheme, which uses the HTTPS RR type instead of SVCB,
   the presence of the "ohttp-configs" parameter means that the service
   being described is an Oblivious HTTP service that uses the default
   "message/bhttp" media type [OHTTP] [BINARY-HTTP].

   When present in an HTTPS record, the "ohttp-configs" MUST be included
   in the mandatory parameter list, to ensure that implementations that
   do not understand the key do not interpret this service as a generic
   HTTP service.

   Clients MUST validate that they can parse the value of "ohttp-
   configs" as a valid key configuration before attempting to use the
   service.

3.2.  Use in DNS server SVCB records

   For the "dns" scheme, as defined in [DNS-SVCB], the presence of the
   "ohttp-configs" parameter means that the DNS server being described
   is an Oblivious DNS over HTTP (DoH) service.  The default media type
   expected for use in Oblivious HTTP to DNS resolvers is "application/
   dns-message" [DOH].

   The "ohttp-configs" parameter is only defined for use with DoH, so
   the "alpn" SvcParamKey MUST indicate support for a version of HTTP
   and the "dohpath" SvcParamKey MUST be present.  The "ohttp-configs"
   MUST also be included in the mandatory parameter list, to ensure that
   implementations that do not understand the key do not interpret this
   service as a generic DoH service.

   Clients MUST validate that they can parse the value of "ohttp-
   configs" as a valid key configuration before attempting to use the
   service.

3.2.1.  Use with DDR

   Clients can discover an oblivious DNS server configuration using DDR,
   by either querying _dns.resolver.arpa to a locally configured
   resolver or querying using the name of a resolver [DDR].

   In the case of oblivious DNS servers, the client might not be able to
   directly use the verification mechanisms described in [DDR], which
   rely on checking for known resolver IP addresses or hostnames in TLS

   certificates, since clients do not generally perform TLS with
   oblivious targets.  A client MAY perform a direct connection to the
   oblivious target server to do this TLS check, however this may be
   impossible or undesirable if the client does not want to ever expose
   its IP address to the oblivious target.  If the client does not use
   the standard DDR verification check, it MUST use some alternate
   mechanism to verify that it should use an oblivious target.  For
   example, the client could have a local policy of known oblivious
   target names that it is allowed to use, or the client could
   coordinate with the oblivious proxy to either have the oblivious
   proxy check the properties of the target's TLS certificate or filter
   to only allow targets known and trusted by the proxy.

   Clients also need to ensure that they are not being targeted with
   unique key configurations that would reveal their identity.  See
   Section 5 for more discussion.

3.2.2.  Use with DNR

   The SvcParamKeys defined in this document also can be used with
   Discovery of Network-designated Resolvers (DNR) [DNR].  In this case,
   the oblivious configuration and path parameters can be included in
   DHCP and Router Advertisement messages.

   While DNR does not require the same kind of verification as DDR,
   clients still need to ensure that they are not being targeted with
   unique key configurations that would reveal their identity.  See
   Section 5 for more discussion.

3.2.3.  Handling Oblivious DoH Configurations

   Oblivious DoH was originally defined in [ODOH].  This version of
   Oblivious DoH uses a different key configuration format than generic
   Oblivious HTTP.  SVCB records using the "dns" scheme can include one
   or more ObliviousDoHConfig structures using the "odoh-configs"
   parameter.

   In wire format, the value of the "odoh-configs" parameter is one or
   more ObliviousDoHConfigs structures [ODOH] concatenated together.  In
   presentation format, the value is the same structures encoded in
   Base64 [BASE64].

   All other requirements for "ohttp-configs" in this document apply to
   "odoh-configs".

4.  Deployment Considerations

   Deployments that add the "ohttp-configs" SvcParamKey need to be
   careful to add this only to services meant to be accessed using
   Oblivious HTTP.  Information in a single SVCB record that contains
   "ohttp-configs" only applies to the oblivious service, not other HTTP
   services.

   If a service offers both traditional HTTP and oblivious HTTP, these
   can be represented by separate SVCB or HTTPS records, both with and
   without the "ohttp-configs" SvcParamKey.

5.  Security and Privacy Considerations

   When discovering designated oblivious DNS servers using this
   mechanism, clients need to ensure that the designation is trusted in
   lieu of being able to directly check the contents of the target
   server's TLS certificate.  See Section 3.2.1 for more discussion.

   As discussed in [OHTTP], client requests using Oblivious HTTP can
   only be linked by recognizing the key configuration.  In order to
   prevent unwanted linkability and tracking, clients using any key
   configuration discovery mechanism need to be concerned with attacks
   that target a specific user or population with a unique key
   configuration.

   There are several approaches clients can use to mitigate key
   targetting attacks.  [CONSISTENCY] provides an analysis of the
   options for ensuring the key configurations are consistent between
   different clients.  Clients SHOULD employ some technique to mitigate
   key targetting attack.  One mitigation specific to this mechanism is
   validating that SVCB or HTTPS records including the "oblivious-
   configs" are protected by DNSSEC [DNSSEC].  This prevents attacks
   where a unique response is generated for each client of a resolver.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add the following entry to the SVCB Service
   Parameters registry ([SVCB]).
