1. Introduction 

   This document provides foundational information model Appling GMPLS 
   to WDM network, we called the series of function aggregation for 
   GMPLS applied to WDM network "WSON" (Wavelength Switch Optical 
   Network). This likewise includes automatic discovery, route, and 
   signaling. But the current standard RFC cannot completely support 
   WSON implementation. It is well-known that RWA is the key problem in 
   WSON. There are certain constraints in the light path computation and 
   selection process, this is the root of RWA problem. This document 
   provides the constraint information model used for optical light path

   computation and selection. Actually the information model needs to 
   solve two problems: one is the inner optical light path routing 
   representation information and the corresponding available resources 
   (Wavelengths) description. The other is the switch capability 
   information based on the optical wavelength channel layer or Optical-
   Electronic switch port, this is also used for multi-layer path 
   computation and implementation. 

   In WDM network, there are certain specific constraints which are 
   different from other circuit switched network such as Time Division 
   Multiplexing (TDM). The constraints mainly include:  

   a) WDM link layer constraint, if the traffic need to pass through 
   from linear ingress port to linear egress port, there must be having 
   the inner connectivity from linear ingress port to linear egress  
   port.  

   b) WDM optical channel layer constraint, the traffic carried in the 
   wavelength need to keep consistent along the light path without O-E-O 
   (Optical-Electrical-Optical), it is known that this is "wavelength 
   continuity" constraint. Even though there are certain wavelength 
   switch capabilities by O-E-O way, but which cannot support full 
   switch because of the electronic matrix switch capability limitation.  

   c) WDM optical tributary constraint, not every linear Ingress port 
   could have the inner light path connectivity and available 
   wavelengths along the inner light path to tributary drop ports. And 
   not every tributary add port could have the inner light path 
   connectivity and available wavelengths along the inner light path to 
   linear egress ports. 

   In addition optical impairments (such as signal power, OSNR) are not 
   to be considered. 

   This document prefer to the combined RWA way to describe information 
   model and efficient encodings extension to GMPLS IGP application. In 
   addition these useful information and encodings could be conveyed to 
   a path computation element (PCE).

3. Link Verification 

   Link verification is used to verify the physical connectivity of the 
   data links and to exchange the Interface Ids of the data links. The 
   data links between adjacent nodes in WDM network also need the 
   transport medium to verify the connectivity and exchange the 
   interface Ids of data plane. Then synchronize the data links to form 
   TE link used for path computation and signaling. RFC4207 have 
   significantly defined the mechanisms of link connectivity applicable 
   to SDH/SONET. But for WDM system, there is no significant definition 
   for the link connectivity verification mechanism. OSC channel is the 
   natural and specific transport channel embedded in the WDM link. So 
   this document defines the new link verification mechanism used for 
   WDM link. The following is the two mechanism definition. 

   One is that Test message is sent over OSC channel and TestStatus 
   messages sent back over the control channel. The Test Message is 
   defined in [RFC4204]. 

   The other is that the OSC channel is used to send and receive Trace 
   Message. The Test Message is not transmitted over OSC channel (i.e., 
   over the data link), but is sent over the control channel and 
   correlated for consistency to the received Trace Message from OSC 
   channel. 

   The content of Trace Message is unique in the network. It could be 
   the combination of local interface Id and Node Id. 

   The process of link connectivity verification between adjacent WDM 
   nodes is consistent with SDH/SONET, this can be referred to [RFC4204] 
   and [RFC4207].

   Link Constraint Character 

   Wavelength Continuity Constraint 

   O-E-O Wavelength Switch Capability 

   Optical-Electronic Conversion Port Switch Capability 

   Tunable Transmitter Laser 

    4.1. WDM Link Bandwidth 

   The bandwidth of WDM link should be regarded as the number of 
   wavelengths, which could not be counted as signal rates because the 
   wavelength cannot be restricted to carry certain rates of signal, or 
   certain frame type of signal. 

   Consider to interlayer, Wavelength channel layer is used to be server 
   layer path to carry client traffic, such as SDH/SONET, ODUk. 

    4.2. WDM Link Layer Constraint 

   Inner link connectivity of one link with other links in one node 
   identifies the link constraint information. The link constraint 
   information indicates out the possibility of conveying traffic  

   in the link layer. 

    4.3. WDM Optical Channel Constraint 

   It is known that the wavelength basically need to keep consistent 
   along the light path, this is called Wavelength continuity  
   constraint. Even though O-E-O conversion can add certain wavelength 
   switch capability to the system, but the electronic matrix in the WDM 
   equipment do not completely have the full switch capability. In 
   addition wavelength switch capability information only can be applied 
   to the condition that is the specific wavelength must have the single 
   correlation with one fixed Optical-Electronic switch port whose 
   transmitter laser is not tunable. Under this condition, wavelength 
   switch capability can be characterized by an input wavelength set and 
   an output wavelength set. The signals carried in an input wavelength 
   set flow in the same electronic matrix unit, do switch, and then flow 
   out with equivalent contents bearing the output wavelength set. We 
   named "Lambda Group Id" to represent the identification of 
   aggregation of an input wavelength set and an output wavelength set 
   which could be mutually switched, Lambda Group Id could be the

   identification of electronic matrix unit in the system. The "Lambda 
   Group Id" is carried with wavelength status to represent the 
   wavelength constraint information. 

   So wavelength availability and switch capability information are 
   important to analyze the availability of resources along the light 
   path. 

    4.4. WDM Optical Tributary Constraint 

   Not every linear Ingress port could have the inner light path 
   connectivity and available wavelengths along the inner light path to 
   tributary drop ports. It is also that not every tributary add port 
   could have the inner light path connectivity and available 
   wavelengths along the inner light path to linear egress ports. 

   The link information should indicate out the reachable tributary 
   ports and corresponding available wavelengths for the reachable 
   tributary ports. 

    4.5. Optical-Electronic Conversion Port Switch Capability 

   Port switch capability indicate out the traffic with one specific 
   wavelength (which is in the tunable extent) flow in Optical-
   Electronic Conversion ingress port, do optical-electronic conversion, 
   do electronic matrix switch, then do electronic-optical conversion, 
   flow out from Optical-Electronic Conversion egress port with one 
   specific wavelength (which is in the tunable extent). The port switch 
   capability could be characterized by one unique ID in one node which 
   represents the aggregation of ingress ports and egress ports. The 
   unique ID is named O-E-O switch ID. 

   The link information also needs to indicate out the reachable 
   Optical-Electronic Conversion Ports and the corresponding available 
   wavelengths. The port switch capability is accompanied with t his 
   information. 

   This is the base model to implement wavelength switch by O-E-O way. 

    4.6. Tunable Laser 

   The transmitter laser is tunable, this add certain flexibility for 
   the inner path computation and selection process.

5. Information Model 

    5.1. Link Information 

   WDM link information derives from RFC3630 and RFC4203, and adds new 
   sub-element constraints to link information model: 

   (a) Maximum of optical channels (wavelength), which is the bandwidth 
   of WDM link. 

   (b) Link index, this is used to account for the bit map position in 
   the link constraint information, this is one global unique Id start 
   from 1 and assigned in the node. 

   (c) Link constraint information, which represents the connectivity 
   with other links, and was indicated by the bit map, the bit position 
   represents the connectivity with one link, or indicated by the link 
   set. 

   (d) Wavelength availability, which represent the state of the 
   corresponding optical wavelength channel. 

   (e) Wavelength switch capability, one set of wavelength aggregation 
   could be switched via electronic matrix. The optical signals carried 
   in the wavelength can flow to or flow out from the same electronic 
   matrix unit after optical-electronic-optical change, all of these 
   wavelengths could switch. One global unique ID named "Lambda Group 
   Id" represents one electronic matrix unit. The Lambda Group Id is the 
   identification of the aggregation of wavelengths in which the optical 
   signals flow to or flow out from the same matrix unit. 

   Lambda Group Id represent the aggregation of wavelength set, the 
   wavelengths with same Lambda Group Id can be mutually switched via O-
   E-O. The special value 0 represent the optical signal carried in the 
   wavelength only can pass via the same wavelength, and do not have the 
   wavelength switch capability. 

   Wavelength switch capability can be identified by Lambda Group Id, 
   which was carried with Wavelength availability information. 

   (f) Reachable tributary add or drop ports, link information should 
   indicate out the Reachable tributary add or drop ports. For each 
   reachable port, it also needs to indicate out the available 
   wavelengths. For Optical-Electronic conversion port, it also needs to 
   indicate out the switch capability.

   Note: only (a) are necessary for WDM link, others are used for 
   combined RWA.

                  Figure 1 O-E-O Wavelength Switch Model 

   The Lambda Group ID is identification of the aggregation of 
   Wavelength set in which the wavelengths could be mutually switched, 
   and is also the identification of O-E-O switch capability. Here don't 
   consider the asymmetric switch matrix. 

   The figure showed above, the link from DWDM1 have three lambdas 
   (Lambda 1, Lambda 2, Lambda 3) flow to the matrix unit1, the link 
   from DWDM2 have three lambdas (Lambda 5, Lambda 6, Lambda 7) flow to 
   the matrix unit1, they could be switched. Likewise the link from 
   DWDM3 have three lambdas (Lambda 1, Lambda 3, Lambda 4) flow to the

   matrix unit2, the link from DWDM4 have three lambdas (Lambda 3, 
   Lambda 5, Lambda 7) flow to the matrix unit2, they could be switched. 

   For the lambdas (Lambda 1, Lambda 2, Lambda 3) of the link of DWDM1 
   and the lambdas (Lambda 5, Lambda 6, Lambda 7) of the link of DWDM2, 
   the Lambda Group ID could assign to be 1; 

   For the lambdas (Lambda 1, Lambda 3, Lambda 4) of the link of DWDM3 
   and the lambdas (Lambda 3, Lambda 5, Lambda 7) of the link of DWDM4, 
   the Lambda Group ID could assign to be 2; 

   So the lambda group id is the identification of wavelength switch 
   capability, and also is the identification of the aggregation of 
   Wavelength set in which the wavelengths could be mutually switched, 
   and their lambda group ids are same. 

   The special value 0 lambda group id represent the optical signal 
   carried in the wavelength only can pass via the same wavelength.  
   Do not have the capability of O-E-O.

   The figure showed above, there are four optical-electronic conversion 
   units. These four optical-electronic conversion units could be 
   mutually switched via one electronic switch unit. The port switch 
   capability can be characterized by one unique ID named O-E-O Switch 
   ID which is related to the electronic switch unit identification. 

   The link information indicates out the reachable optical-electronic 
   conversion ports and the available resources. In addition, for each 
   reachable port, it also indicates out the port switch capability.  

    5.4. Wavelength Label 

   This document makes frequent use of the lambda label format defined 
   in [Otani] shown below: 

    0                   1                   2                   3

   Grid is used to indicate which ITU-T grid specification is being  
   used. 

   C.S. = Channel spacing used in a DWDM system, i.e., with an ITU-T 
   G.694.1 grid. 

   S = Sign for the value of n, set to 1 for (-) and 0 for (+). 

   n = Used to specify the frequency as 193.1THz +/- n*(channel spacing) 
   where the + or - is chosen based on the sign (S) bit. 

6. Application to OSPF GMPLS extensions 

    6.1. Link Sub-TLVs 

   As discussed in section 5.1, some sub-TLVs need to characterize for 
   WDM links.

6.1.1. Maximum of optical channels sub-TLV 

   Maximum of optical channels sub-TLV specifies the maximum optical 
   wavelength channels that can be used on this WDM link. The value can 
   be 40, 80, 160, 192 etc. 

6.1.2. Link Constraint sub-TLV 

   There are two ways to show the link connectivity constraint with 
   other links. One is the links including list, the second is the bit 
   map to indicate the connectivity with other links. The second need to 
   assign the unique index for each link. The information carried in the 
   link constraint is: 

   0                   1                   2                   3

   Method: 6 bits 

   0 - Bit Map 

   1 - Link Set 

   Others - Reserved to be used later. 

   Index: 8 bits 

   Index is one unique Id assigned in the node, start from 1. This is 
   used to account for bit position in the bit map carried in other 
   links constraint sub-TLV. 

   Num Links: 8 bits 

   Num links tell us the number of link identifiers followed or the 
   number bits of link connectivity represented by the bit map. 

   Bit map have the same rule in the link constraint information in 
   order that RWA algorithm can analyze the connectivity of links. Each 
   bit in the bit map represents one specific link with value 1/0 
   indicating the constraint connectivity with the link. The bit 
   position represent the specific link which is its own, the value on 
   this bit is 1.
