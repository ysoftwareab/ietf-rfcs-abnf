1. Introduction 

   RFC4655 defines the PCE based architecture and explains how a PCE may 
   compute LSPs in MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) and GMPLS) networks at 
   the request of Path Computation Clients (PCCs).

   RFC5440 specifies the PCEP for communication between a PCC and a PCE, 
   or between two PCEs, in compliance with RFC4657. However, that it 
   does not provide a mechanism to request path computation for 
   establishing TE LSPs in GMPLS networks such as SDH network. [GMPLS-
   REQ] addresses the functional requirements for GMPLS in PCE 
   application. 

   This document describes the protocol extensions to PCEP to support 
   path computation for TE LSP in GMPLS networks. 

1.1. Requirements Language 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119. 

2. Terminology 

   The following terminology is used in this document. 

   PCC:  Path Computation Client. Any client application requesting a 
         path computation to be performed by the Path Computation 
         Element. 

   PCE:  Path Computation Element. An entity (component, application, or 
         network node) that is capable of computing a network path or 
         route based on a network graph and applying computational 
         constraints. 

   PCEP: Path Computation Element Communication Protocol. PCEP is a 
         request/response protocol used for the communication between a 
         PCC and a PCE, or between two PCEs. 

   PCEP Peer: An element involved in a PCEP session (For example, a PCC 
              or a PCE). 

   PCEP Session: The PCEP session is a logical connection established 
                 automatically between the PCEP peers. 

   This document also uses the terminology defined in RFC4655, and 
   RFC5440. 

3. PCEP Requirements 

   This section summarizes the PCEP extensions for GMPLS. This document 
   introduces no new messages for PCEP. However, extensions have been 
   introduced to the existing PCEP objects, sub-objects and TLVs. Also,

draft-zhang-pce-pcep-extensions-for-gmps-00.txt            February 2010 
 
 
   a few new objects and TLVs have been introduced to support network 
   type and QoS. The details on the PCEP objects and TLVs are mentioned 
   below: 

   Enhanced Objects 

       o PCEP End Point (IPv4/Node ID) Object 
       o PCEP NO-PATH Object 

   Newly Introduced Object 

       o PCEP QoS Object 

   Newly Introduced TLVs 

       o Destination Prefix Information 
       o Traffic Parameters 
       o LSP Protection Information 

4. Protocol Procedure and Extensions 

4.1. SWITCH-LAYER Object 

   The PCE architecture can be extended to support various network types 
   such as SDH, WDM, OTN, and PTN and so on. PCE MAY select the 
   appropriate policy profile depending on the current path request 
   which is applicable to a particular network type. 

   The SWITCH-LAYER object is an OPTIONAL object and MUST be carried 
   only in PCReq and PCRep message specifying the encoding and switching 
   type of the network, to which the path request belongs to. This 
   object is defined in [INTER-LAYER] (Section 3.2).  
    
4.2. END-POINTS Object Extension 

   The END-POINTS object is used in a PCReq message to specify the 
   source IP address and the destination IP address of the path for 
   which a path computation is requested. New OPTIONAL TLV is defined   
   that is to be carried in the END-POINTS object for the path that   
   depends on destination prefix information. 

4.2.1. Destination Prefix Information TLV 

   The Destination Prefix Information TLV is a new OPTIONAL TLV. It MUST 
   only appear inside END-POINTS (IPv4/Node ID) object. The receiver 
   SHOULD ignore the Destination Prefix Information TLV if it appears in 
 
 
zhang                   Expires August 2010                     [Page 4] 

draft-zhang-pce-pcep-extensions-for-gmps-00.txt            February 2010 
 
 
   any other object other than END-POINTS object. This TLV contains the 
   prefix length for the destination IPv4 address and will appear when 
   prefix length is in the range between 0 and 32 (inclusive). 

   The format of the Destination Prefix Information TLV is as follows: 

    0                   1                   2                   3  
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |          Type = 20            |           Length = 4          | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |  Destination  |     Flags   |E|            Reserved           | 
   | Prefix Length |     Field   |M|                               | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

   Destination Prefix Length (8-bits) - Specifies the prefix length of 
   the destination IPv4 address. 

   Flags Field (7-bits) - Reserved for future to define new flags. It 
   MUST be filled with zeros and SHOULD be ignored by the receiver. 

   EM- Exact Prefix Match (1-bit) - Specifies whether exact prefix match 
   is required for the destination IPv4 address. 

      Bit                EM Type 

       0       Exact prefix match is not required 

       1       Exact prefix match is required 

   Reserved (16-bits) - Reserved. MUST be set to zero and SHOULD be 
   ignored by the receiver. 

4.3. New Object - QoS 

   When a PCC requests a PCE for a route, and if PCE provides the 
   response to the request, it MAY be useful for the PCC and the PCE to 
   include the traffic parameters. These traffic parameters specify a 
   base set of capabilities for GMPLS networks such as Service Level 
   Agreement (SLA), protection scheme, segment recovery, concatenation, 
   transparency, and so on. The QoS object handles the quality of 
   service parameters for TE-LSPs in GMPLS networks. 

   The QoS object can be included in the PCReq and PCRep messages by the 
   PCC and PCE respectively. It represents the parameters that become 
   necessary to manage bandwidth in the networks. When a PCE cannot find 
   a path by satisfying a set of constraints requested by the PCC, the 
 
 
zhang                   Expires August 2010                     [Page 5] 

draft-zhang-pce-pcep-extensions-for-gmps-00.txt            February 2010 
 
 
   PCE may also include the original constraint so as to indicate the 
   reason for an unsuccessful computation in the NO-PATH object. Based 
   on the available service parameters proposed by a PCE, the PCC MAY 
   decide to resend the path requests. These parameters ensure that the 
   applications are guaranteed the network resources they need, despite 
   varying traffic load. 

   The format of the QoS object is as follows: 

    0                   1                   2                   3  
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   | Object Class  |   OT  |Res|P|I|        Object Length          | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |                                                               | 
   //                    Traffic Parameters TLV                    // 
   |                                                               | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   //                LSP Protection Information TLV                // 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

   Object Class (8-bits) - Specifies the class of the object (Value = 
   25). 

   OT - Object Type (4-bits) - Specifies the type of the object (Value = 
   1). 

4.3.1. Traffic Parameters TLV 

   For different networks, different traffic parameters should be 
   embedded in the Traffic Parameters TLV, which is a new OPTIONAL TLV. 
   The following types are defined currently: 

      Object Type    Name                   Remarks 

      34            SDH-Traffic             SDH/Sonet networks 

      35            G.709-Traffic           OTN digital wrapper 

      36            WSON-Traffic            WSON 

      37            Ethernet-Traffic        Ethernet 

      38            PTN                     TBD 

   For SDH-Traffic, the contents of this object are identical in 
   encoding to the contents of the Resource Reservation Protocol Traffic

draft-zhang-pce-pcep-extensions-for-gmps-00.txt            February 2010 
 
 
   Engineering Extensions (RSVP-TE)SONET and SDH Parameters defined in 
   RFC4606 (section 2.1). 

   For G.709-Traffic, the contents of this object are identical with the 
   Traffic Parameters defined in [OTN-SIG]. 

   For WSON-Traffic and Ethernet-Traffic, we can refer to [WSON-SIG] and 
   [Eth-Traffic]. 

4.3.2. LSP Protection Information TLV 

   The LSP Protection Information TLV is a new OPTIONAL TLV and MUST 
   only appear inside QoS object. This TLV contains the LSP recovery 
   attributes, LSP association and protection constraints that are 
   required during signaling to support end-to-end LSP recovery. 

   The information of end-to-end LSP recovery during GMPLS signaling is 
   already defined in RFC4872 and RFC4873. Henceforth, the contents of 
   LSP Protection Information TLV defined in this document is identical 
   to the Protection Object defined in RFC4873 (section 6.1).  

   LSP Protection Information TLV type is 40. 

4.3.3. SWITCH-LAYER and QoS Object in PCReq and PCRep 

   As mentioned earlier the SWITCH-LAYER and QoS object MAY be included 
   in the PCReq message. These objects are OPTIONAL, and if QoS object 
   is present only one instance of SDH-ASON QoS parameters TLV or LSP 
   protection TLV must be included. If multiple instances of TLV or some 
   other TLV is present, then the complete message has to be discarded 
   without performing any further processing. 

   The format of the PCReq message including the SWITCH-LAYER and QoS 
   object is as follows: 

   <PCReq Message> ::= <Common Header> 
                       [<svec-list>] 
                       <request-list> 

   where: 

          <svec-list> ::= <SVEC>[<svec-list>] 

          <request-list> ::= <request>[<request-list>] 

          <request> ::= <RP> 
                        <SWITCH-LAYER>

                        [<IRO>] 
                        [<LOAD-BALANCING>] 

   The format of the PCRep message is as follows: 

   <PCRep Message> ::= <Common Header> 
                       <response-list> 

   where:

                         [<path-list>] 

          <path-list> ::= <path>[<path-list>] 

          <path> ::= <ERO><attribute-list> 

   where: 

          <attribute-list> ::= [<LSPA>] 
                               [<BANDWIDTH>] 
                               [<QoS>] 
                               [<metric-list>] 
                               [<IRO>] 

          <metric-list> ::= <METRIC>[<metric-list>] 

    

4.4. NO-PATH Object Extension 

   The NO-PATH object is used in PCRep messages in response to an 
   unsuccessful path computation request (the PCE could not find a path 
   by satisfying the set of constraints). In this scenario, PCE MUST 
   include a NO-PATH object in the PCRep message. 

 
 
zhang                   Expires August 2010                     [Page 8] 

draft-zhang-pce-pcep-extensions-for-gmps-00.txt            February 2010 
 
 
   The NO-PATH object carries the NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV that specifies more 
   information on the reasons that led to a negative reply. In case of 
   GMPLS networks there could be some more additional constraints that 
   led to the failure like protection mismatch, lack of resources, and 
   so on. Few new flags have been introduced in 32-bit flag field of the 
   NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV and no modifications have been made in the NO-PATH 
   object. 

4.4.1. Extensions to NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV 

   The modified NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV carrying the additional information 
   is as follows: 

    0                   1                   2                   3  
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |          Type = 1             |           Length = 4          | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |                       Flags                         |N|P|U|U|N| 
   |                       Field                         |R|M|S|D|P| 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

   NP - PCE currently unavailable 
   UD - Unknown destination 
   US - Unknown source 
 
   New fields PM and NR are defined in the 28th and 27th bit of the 
   Flags field respectively. 

   PM - Protection Mismatch (1-bit). Specifies the mismatch of the 
   protection type in the request. 

   NR - No Resource (1-bit). Specifies that the resources are not 

   currently sufficient to provide the path. 

    

4.5. Additional Error Type and Error Values Defined 

   A PCEP-ERROR object is used to report a PCEP error and is 
   characterized by an Error-Type that specifies the type of error and 
   an Error-value that provides additional information about the error 
   type. An additional error type and few error values are defined to 
   represent some of the errors related to the newly identified objects 
   related to GMPLS networks.

draft-zhang-pce-pcep-extensions-for-gmps-00.txt            February 2010 
 
 
   For each PCEP error, an Error-Type and an Error-value are defined. 
   Error-Type 1 to 10 is already defined in RFC5440. Additional Error-
   values are defined for Error-Type 10 and a new Error-Type 14 is 
   introduced. 

     Error-Type          Error-value 

         10        Reception of an invalid object 

                   Error-value=2: LSP Protection Information TLV missing 
                                  in QoS object. 

                   Error-value=3: TLV missing in QoS object.

5. Liveness Detection and Monitoring 

   This document makes no change to the basic operation of PCEP and so 
   there are no changes to the requirements for liveness detection and 
   monitoring set out in RFC4657 and RFC5440. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   IANA assigns values to the PCEP protocol objects and TLVs. IANA is 
   requested to make some allocations for the newly defined objects and 
   TLVs introduced in this document. Also, IANA is requested to manage 
   the space of flags that are newly added in the TLVs. 

6.1. New PCEP Object 

   IANA is requested to make some allocations for the QoS object:

         25             QoS Object-Type-1   This document (section 4.5) 

    

6.2. New PCEP TLVs 

   IANA is requested to create a registry for the following TLVs: 

    Value         Meaning                         Reference 

      20   Destination Prefix Information   This document (section 4.1.1)

      40   LSP Protection Information       This document (section 4.2.2) 

6.3. PCEP NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV Flag Field 

   IANA is requested to update the registry that manages the Flag field 
   of the NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV. 

   New bit numbers may be allocated only by an IETF Consensus action. 
   Each bit should be tracked with the following qualities: 

   o  Bit number (counting from bit 0 as the most significant bit) 

   o  Name Flag 

   o  Reference 

   Code space of the Flag field (NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV). 

   Bit Number     Name                   Reference

6.4. New PCEP Error Codes 

   As descried in Section 4.5, new PCEP Error-Type and Error Values are 
   defined. IANA is requested to manage the code space of the Error 
   object. 

    Error-Type          Error-value 

         10        Reception of an invalid object 

                   Error-value=2: LSP Protection Information TLV missing 
                                  in QoS object. 

                   Error-value=3: TLV missing in QoS object. 

                   Error-value=4: Multiple instance of TLV present in 
                                  QoS object. 

                   Error-value=5: Unsupported TLV present in QoS object. 

                   Error-value=6: Traffic Parameters TLV missing in QoS 
                                  object. 

         14        Path computation failure 

                   Error-value=1: Unacceptable response message. 

                   Error-value=2: QoS object missing in request message. 

7. Security Considerations 

   The protocol extensions defined in this document do not substantially 
   change the nature of PCEP. Therefore, the security considerations set 
   out in RFC5440 apply unchanged. 

8. Acknowledgements 

   The authors would like to thank Cyril Margaria, Pradeep Shastry, 
   Thiyagarajan Manickam, and Hemalatha G for their suggestions during 
   the development of this draft.
