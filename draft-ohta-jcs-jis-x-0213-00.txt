Abstract

   This memo describes six MIME charsets: ISO-2022-JP-3, ISO-2022-JP-3-
   plane1, Shift_JISX0213, Shift_JISX0213-plane1, EUC-JISX0213, EUC-
   JISX0213-plane1 for Japanese text encoding on the Internet with
   characters of ASCII, JIS X 0201, JIS X 0211, JIS X 0208 and JIS X
   0213.

   ISO-2022-JP-3 is the encoding for Japanese text and suitable for use
   in MIME. ISO-2022-JP-3-plane1 is a subset of ISO-2022-JP-3.

   Shift_JISX0213, Shift_JISX0213-plane1, EUC-JISX0213 and EUC-
   JISX0213-plane1 are intended to be used internal to hosts or
   applications and not suitable for use in MIME.

INTERNET DRAFT Japanese Character Encoding with JIS X 0213  October 1999

1. Introduction

   JCS (JIS Coded Character Set) Committee has defined a new CCS (Coded
   Character Set), JIS X 0213 [JISX0213], which mostly is an extension
   of JIS X 0208 [JISX0208], to encode usual Japanese text.

   JIS X 0213 has two planes, plane1 and plane2 and can be subsetted to
   use plane1 only.

   To use characters of JIS X 0213, JCS committee defines 6 new
   charsets: ISO-2022-JP-3, ISO-2022-JP-3-plane1, Shift_JISX0213,
   Shift_JISX0213-plane1, EUC-JISX0213 and EUC-JISX0213-plane1 according
   to the guidelines of BCP 19, RFC 2278 [BCP19].

2. ISO-2022-JP-3

   ISO-2022-JP-3 consists of CCSes of ASCII [ASCII], JIS X 0208
   [JISX0208] and JIS X 0213 [JISX0213].

   The CES (Character Encoding Scheme) of ISO-2022-JP-3 uses escape
   sequences of ISO 2022 [ISO2022] and is like that of ISO-2022-JP
   [RFC1463].

   The full specification of the CES of ISO-2022-JP-3 is given in Annex
   2 of [JISX0213].

   ISO-2022-JP-3 is suitable for use in MIME [MIME1].

   MIBenum of ISO-2022-JP-3 is <to be assigned by IANA>.

3. ISO-2022-JP-3-plane1

   ISO-2022-JP-3-plane1 is identical to ISO-2022-JP-3, except that no
   characters of JIS X 0213 plane 2 can be used.

   MIBenum of ISO-2022-JP-3-plane1 is <to be assigned by IANA>.

4. Shift_JISX0213

   Shift_JISX0213 consists of CCSes of JIS X 0201 [JISX0201], JIS X 0211
   [JISX0211] and JIS X 0213.

   The CES of Shift_JISX0213 is like that of charset Shift_JIS.

   The full specification of the CES of Shift_JISX0213 is given in Annex
   1 of [JISX0213].

   Shift_JISX0213 is not suitable for use in MIME.

INTERNET DRAFT Japanese Character Encoding with JIS X 0213  October 1999

   MIBenum of Shift_JISX0213 is <to be assigned by IANA>.

5. Shift_JISX0213-plane1

   Shift_JISX0213-plane1 is identical to  Shift_JISX0213, except that no
   characters of JIS X 0213 plane 2 can be used.

   MIBenum of Shift_JISX0213-plane1 is <to be assigned by IANA>.

6. EUC-JISX0213

   EUC-JISX0213 consists of CCSes of ASCII, JIS X 0208, JIS X 0201 Kana
   and JIS X 0213.

   The CES of EUC-JISX0213 is like that of charset EUC-JP.

   The full specification of the CES of EUC-JISX0213 is given in Annex 3
   of [JISX0213].

   EUC-JISX0213 is not suitable for use in MIME.

   MIBenum of EUC-JISX0213 is <to be assigned by IANA>.

7. EUC-JISX0213-plane1

   EUC-JISX0213-plane1 is identical to  EUC-JISX0213, except that no
   characters of JIS X 0213 plane 2 can be used.

   MIBenum of EUC-JISX0213-plane1 is <to be assigned by IANA>.

9. Security Considerations

   This memo defines MIME charsets, interpretation of which should
   result in text displayed without any side effects such as device
   control, which is believed to be unrelated to security issues.
