Application Bridging for Federated Access Beyond web (ABFAB) Credential
                       Forwarding and Delegation
           draft-paetow-abfab-credential-forward-delegate-00

Abstract

   A core use case of ABFAB-based authentication is access to remote
   systems.  In this and other use cases it is preferable that the same
   identity initially used to gain access to the remote system is used
   for further authentication sessions from the initial system onwards.
   The current architecture and UI considerations require the use of
   secure storage local to the system for any identities from that
   system onwards.  This document aims to explore alternate proposals
   for the reuse of an identity configured on the initial ABFAB-enabled
   client device by the use of credential forwarding or delegation in a
   similar fashion to those used by other GSS-API mechanisms.

1.  Introduction

   One of the primary use cases for ABFAB-based authentication is the
   use in HPC and grid computing systems.  There currently exists no
   mechanism to allow the delegation or forwarding on of the initial
   identity configured for the system from the client device, therefore
   it is only possible to either use ABFAB authentication to a single
   system, or manually configure the chosen identity on the client
   device.

   This document intends to explore the possibilities of credential
   delegation or credential forwarding in ABFAB in a similar fashion as
   is currently available in other authentication mechanisms.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   Various items of terminology used in the document are heavily
   overloaded in that they mean a variety of different things to
   different people.  In an attempt to minimise this problem, this
   section gives a brief description of the main items of terminology
   used in order to aid a consistent understanding of this document.

   o  Identity: In this context, an identity is a credential given to a
      user by a particular organisation with which they have an
      association.  A user may have multiple identities - potentially
      multiple identities per organisation, and also across multiple
      organisations.  Each identity will consist of an NAI, alongside
      other information that supports authentication.  Note that in
      other contexts the usual use of "identity" would match our use of
      "user", whereas the usual use of "identifier" matches our use of
      identity.

   o  Service: The thing that the user is attempting to authenticate to
      via ABFAB technology.  See [I-D.ietf-abfab-usecases] for some
      example ABFAB use cases.  Also known as the Relying Party.

4.  Context

   When using the ABFAB architecture (see [I-D.ietf-abfab-arch]) to
   perform federated authentication to some service, a user provides
   identity information that they wish to use to authenticate to that
   particular service.  This identity information is provided for
   authentication to that specific service only, therefore any further
   authentication from that service to other ABFAB-based services is not
   possible unless the identity information is also configured locally
   on this particular service for use with other services.

   This design is inadequate, particularly where the secure identity
   storage on this particular service is ephemeral, or where the
   security of the user's home directory cannot be guaranteed.  In some
   instances, this can be minimised, primarily with smart service
   design, but there is simply no guarantee that this is the case
   everywhere.  Thus the solution may lie in credential forwarding or
   delegation.
