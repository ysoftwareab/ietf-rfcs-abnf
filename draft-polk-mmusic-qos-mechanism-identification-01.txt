Abstract

   The offer/answer model for SDP assumes that endpoints establish,
   somehow, the QoS (Quality of Service) required for the media streams
   they establish.  Endpoints in closed environments typically agree out
   of band (e.g., using configuration information) which QoS mechanism
   to use.  However, in the Internet, there is more than one QoS service
   available.  Consequently, there is a need for a mechanism to

Internet-Draft       An Identification QoS Mechanism          March 2006


1.  Introduction

   The offer/answer model [1] for SDP [2] does not provide any mechanism
   for endpoints to negotiate the QoS mechanism to be used for a
   particular media stream.  Even when QoS preconditions [9] are used,
   the choice of the QoS mechanism is left unspecified, up to the
   endpoints.

   Endpoints that support more than one QoS mechanism need a way to
   negotiate which one to use for a particular media stream.  Examples
   of QoS mechanisms are RSVP (Resource Reservation Protocol), initially
   defined in [3], and NSIS (Next Steps in Signaling), defined in at
   least 3 documents: [4], [5] and [6].

   This document defines a mechanism that allows endpoints to negotiate
   the QoS mechanism to be used for a particular media stream.
   Section 3 defines the 'qos-selection' SDP attribute, Section 4
   specifies the use of the 'qos-selection' attribute with the offer/
   answer model, and Section 5 provides examples of offer/answer
   exchanges that use the 'qos-selection' attribute.


2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [7] and indicate requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.


3.  Definition of the qos-selection Attribute

   This document defines the 'qos-selection' session and media-level SDP
   [2] attribute.  The following is its ABNF syntax [8], which is based
   on the SDP [2] grammar:

   attribute              = qos-selection-attr

   qos-selection-attr     = "qos-selection" ":" qos-mech SP direction

   qos-mech               = rsvp / nsis / extension-mech
   extension-mech         = token

   direction              = send / recv / sendrecv

   Figure 1: Syntax of the qos-selection attribute

   The 'qos-mech' token identifies a QoS mechanism that is supported by
   the entity generating the session description.  The 'direction' token
   indicates in which direction can be used to reserve resources that
   QoS mechanism.

   send: QoS can be reserved for traffic sent by the entity generating
      the session description.
   recv: QoS can be reserved for traffic received by the entity
      generating the session description.
   sendrecv: QoS can be reserved for traffic in both directions.

   An SDP session description MAY contain more than one 'qos-selection'
   attribute.

   The following is an example of an 'm' line with two 'qos-selection'
   attributes:


     m=audio 50000 RTP/AVP 0
     a=qos-selection:rsvp sendrecv
     a=qos-selection:nsis sendrecv


4.  Offer/answer Behavior

   Offerers include a 'qos-selection' attribute per QoS mechanism they
   are willing to use for the media stream.  Each 'qos-selection'
   attribute includes the direction in which the mechanism can be used.

   On receiving an offer with 'qos-selection' attributes, the answerer
   chooses a QoS mechanism from the 'qos-selection' attributes for each
   direction where QoS is needed.  That is, if QoS is needed in both
   directions (sendrecv), the answerer can choose the same QoS mechanism
   for both directions or a different one for each direction.

   The answerer MUST add 'qos-selection' attributes for each QoS
   mechanisms it has chosen to use.  If the answerer lists two QoS
   mechanisms for a given direction, both mechanisms will be used.

   Note that endpoints negotiate in which direction QoS is needed using
   other mechanisms, such as preconditions [9].  Endpoints may also use
   other mechanisms to negotiate, if needed, the parameters to use with
   a given QoS mechanism (e.g., bandwidth to be reserved).


5.  Example

   The following is an offer/answer exchange between two endpoints using

   the 'qos-selection' attribute.  Parts of the session descriptions are
   ommitted for clarity purposes.

   The offerer generates the following session description listing both
   RSVP and NSIS for both directions:


     m=audio 50000 RTP/AVP 0
     a=qos-selection:rsvp sendrecv
     a=qos-selection:nsis sendrecv

   The answerer chooses to use RSVP in both directions and,
   consequently, returns the following session description:


     m=audio 55000 RTP/AVP 0
     a=qos-selection:rsvp sendrecv
