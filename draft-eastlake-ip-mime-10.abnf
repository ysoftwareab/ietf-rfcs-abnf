version=n
         This parameter exposes the IP Version number [RFC 791] in the
         MIME Content-Type.

dilation=nnn
         Typically IP packets will be MIME labeled for transmission over
         email or other application level protocols.  Such transmission
         is generally much slower than lower level network protocols.
         While this is not usually a concern if a packet is just being
         communicated for analysis, if such transmission is used to
         establish a tunnel, the sender of a datagram may wish to advise
         the recipient of the estimated rough time dilation factor.  For
         example, if datagrams typically take around a second and
         occasionally up to ten seconds end-to-end but it is more like a
         minute and occasionally up to ten minutes if they are MIME
         encoded in email, a "dilation=60" parameter would be
         reasonable.  (Since it is a ratio of times, the dilation
         parameter is dimensionless.)

         Note: Although IP and TCP are defined as protocols only loosely
         dependent on time. The IPv4 TTL [RFC 792], although originally
         defined in terms of seconds, is usually implemented as a hop
         count which is how the corresponding IPv6 field is defined [RFC
         1752].  TCP requires a retransmission timer but has no
         specified "time out" after which an unresponsive connection
         must be torn down although all practical implementations have
         such a time out. In the event that IP in MIME encapsulation is
         being used for actual connectivity, it might be desireable to
         scale all such timing by the dilation value if it has been
         provided and is reasonable.

address=xxx
         Full, if slow, IP connectivity via an application level
         protocol such as SMTP [RFC 2821, 2822] might require that
         routing, tunneling, and/or interface entries be installed at
         each end. Routing entries would be best created or updated by
         routing protocol messages and the establishment of tunnels is
         beyond the scope of this MIME type specification.  However, the
         "address=" parameter enables the sender to optionally indicate
         an IP address for return traffic to itself.  This may only be
         useful in cases where the sender knows an address that is
         available for itself in the recipient's addressing environment.
         It can be viewed as a replacement for ARP [RFC 826] on the
         possible path to the source of the APPLICATION/IP object via
         the same application level protocol.  (A receiver of an
         APPLICATION/IP object with an "address=" parameter might
         reasonably require that it be authenticated as meeting their
         policy as to from whom they would accept such information.  For
         example, they could ignore "address=" parameters unless the
         APPLICATION/IP object was wrapped in an acceptable
         MULTIPART/SIGNED [RFC 1847] authentication, although that
         implies some trust relationship between the parties.)

         Examples:

address="192.0.2.123"

address="2001:DB8::123"
