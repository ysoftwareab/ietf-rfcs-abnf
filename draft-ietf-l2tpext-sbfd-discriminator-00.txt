1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-bfd-seamless-base] defines a simplified mechanism to use
   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)[RFC5880].  This mechanism
   depends on network nodes knowing the BFD discriminators which each
   node in the network has reserved for this purpose.  Use of the Layer2
   Tunneling protocol Version 3 (L2TPv3) [RFC3931] is one possible means
   of advertising these discriminators.  S-BFD requires the usage of
   unique discriminators within an administrative domain.

   This document specifies the encoding to be used when S-BFD
   discriminators are advertised using L2TPv3.

2.  S-BFD Target Discriminator ID AVP

   This AVP is exchanged during session negotiation (ICRQ, ICRP, OCRQ,
   OCRP).

2.1.  Encoding Format

   The S-BFD Target Discriminator ID AVP, Attribute Type TBD, is an
   identifier used to advertise the S-BFD target discriminators
   supported by an LCCE for S-BFD Reflector operation.  This AVP
   indicates that the advertiser implements a S-BFD reflector supporting
   the specified target discriminators and is ready for S-BFD Reflector
   operation.  The receiving LCCE MAY use this AVP if it wants to
   monitor connectivity to the advertising LCCE using S-BFD or BFD.

   The Attribute Value field for this AVP has the following format:

   S-BFD Discriminator Advertisement (ICRQ, ICRP, ICCN, OCRQ, OCRP,
   OCCN):

                                                     No. of octets
                 +-----------------------------+
                 | Discriminator Value(s)      |     4/Discriminator
                 :                             :
                 +-----------------------------+


   An LCCE MAY include the S-BFD Discriminator Advertisement AVP in a
   L2TP Control Protocol message (ICRQ, ICRP, OCRQ, OCRP) [RFC3931].
   Multiple S-BFD Discriminators AVPs MAY be advertised by a LCCE.  If
   the other LCCE does not wish to monitor connectivity using S-BFD, it
   MAY safely discard this AVP without affecting the rest of session
   negotiation.  While current use-cases
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-seamless-use-case] of S-BFD require advertisement of
   only one discriminator, the AVP encoding allows specification an
   arbitrary number of discrminators for extensibility.  When multiple
   S-BFD discriminators are advertised, the mechanism to choose a subset
   of specific discriminator(s) is out of scope for this document.

   The M bit of the L2TP Control Protocol Message (ICRQ, ICRP, OCRQ,
   OCRP) [RFC3931] MUST NOT be set inside the S-BFD Target Discriminator
   ID AVP advertisement.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This number space is managed by IANA as per [RFC3438].

   A summary of the new AVPs requested for Attribute Type 0 follows:

4.  Security Considerations

   Security concerns for L2TP are addressed in [RFC3931].  Introduction
   of the S-BFD Discriminator Advertisement AVP introduces no new
   security risks for L2TP.

   Advertisement of the S-BFD discriminators does make it possible for
   attackers to initiate S-BFD sessions using the advertised
   information.  The vulnerabilities this poses and how to mitigate them
   are discussed in the Security Considerations section of
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-seamless-base].
