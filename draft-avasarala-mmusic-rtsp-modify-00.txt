Abstract

   This specification defines the new MODIFY method for the Real Time
   Streaming Protocol (RTSP).  MODIFY method allows a RTSP client to
   indicate to the RTSP server to modify a particular session.  Using
   MODIFY method, a client can indicate to either transfer or share a
   particular streaming session with other RTSP device.

Internet-Draft           The RTSP MODIFY Method           September 2010


1.  Introduction

   The RTSP [1] defines the SETUP method for the RTSP clients to
   establish streaming sessions with RTSP servers.  The SETUP method
   could also be used for session modification when sent in the middle
   of a streaming session.  However this SETUP can only be used for
   changing transport parameters as mentioned in Section 13.3.1 of [1]
   and not for changing the target device.  Now a days with users having
   multiple devices like mobiles, TV, etc it would become necessary to
   facilitate sharing or transfer of content streaming sessions across
   devices.

   As a result in order to facilitate the sharing or transfer of content
   streaming sessions among RTSP based devices, there is a need for a
   mechanism within the RTSP protocol to facilitate this procedure.  The
   MODIFY method defined in this document fulfills the need and provides
   a mechanism for the primary RTSP client to initiate a streaming
   session sharing or transfer with another device.


2.  Document Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [3].


3.  The MODIFY Method

   MODIFY is a RTSP method as defined by [1].  The MODIFY method
   indicates that the RTSP Client intends to modify certain parameters
   of the current streaming session (identified by the RTSP URL).The
   modifications could be a request to the RTSP Server to redirect or
   the share the content streaming session with another RTSP Client.

   This table adds a row to Table 7 of [1] indicating the MODIFY Method
   definitions.

   This table adds a row to Table 8 of [1] defining the semantics of
   RTSP MODIFY method.

3.1.  The Target Header Field

   Target is a RTSP header field as defined by [1]. and provides a URL
   to reference to the target device.


       Target = ("Target" / "r") HCOLON ( name-addr / addr-spec ) *
       (SEMI generic-param)


   The following should be interpreted as if it appeared in Table 10 of
   [1].

                  +---------------+--------+------+


3.3.  Overview of Operation

   Operation of this extension is straightforward.  The RTSP client
   begins with a SETUP request which proceeds normally.  Once the
   content streaming session is in progress, then the RTSP client can
   generate a RTSP MODIFY method that contains the required operation to
   be performed and the target device for the purposes of modifying the
   session target i.e. either adding a new target by sharing the session
   with that device or by changing the target by transferring the
   session to that target.

   The response to a MODIFY request would be a final response indicating
   that the operation is successful or a suitable error response
   indicating failure.  The Allow header could be used to indicate
   support for the MODIFY method.  The usage of MODIFY method SHALL be
   restricted to only changing the target of content streaming session
   and not for any other modifications.

3.4.  Determining support for session target modification

   The content streaming session origination happens as per procedures
   defined in [1].  However a RTSP server compliant to this
   specification SHOULD list the method MODIFY in the Public header
   field in the 200 final response sent to the OPTIONS request.

   If the Public header in the 2xx response from RTSP server contains
   MODIFY method, it indicates that the RTSP server supports session
   modification procedures for changing the target and the RTSP client
   can follow the procedures of Section 3.5.1.

3.5.  MODIFY method handling

3.5.1.  Sending a session modification request

   The MODIFY request would be constructed as would any other request
   within a particular streaming session on a particular URI and only
   when a particular streaming session is active.  The RTSP client
   initiates the MODIFY method request when it wants to either transfer
   or share the ongoing streaming session to or with another RTSP client

   device.

   The RTSP device initiating the MODIFY request SHALL add the Require
   header defined in [1] with the proposed option-tag values "Transfer"
   or "Share" to indicate the action to be taken.

   The RTSP device SHALL also add the proposed Target header as
   described in Section 3.1, containing the target device address to or
   with whom the session is being transferred to or shared with.

3.5.2.  Processing a session modification request

   The MODIFY request is processed as a mid session request.  The
   streaming server looks at the RTSP Require header present in the
   MODIFY request and determines the corresponding action that needs to
   be taken.  Then the server looks for the Target header and determines
   the new target device.

   If the MODIFY is received without the mandatory headers: "Require"
   and "Target", then the server SHALL reject the MODIFY with a 400 Bad
   Request and a Reason-Phrase as "Missing Require header field".  In
   addition if the Require header field has values other than "Transfer"
   or "Share", then the server SHALL reject the MODIFY with a 456 or a
   400 Bad Request response.

          CSeq: 302
          Session: 47112344




5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the MODIFY method are identical to
   those of SETUP and PLAY methods.  It is important that the MODIFY be
   integrity protected and authenticated as coming from the same source
   as the SETUP and PLAY requests. [1] discusses security mechanisms for
   achieving these functions.


6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  MODIFY Method Registration

   As per Section 22.2.2 of [1], this specification registers the RTSP
   MODIFY method.  The information to be added to the registry is:


    RFCXXXX: This specification serves as registration for the MODIFY
             method.

    Method Name: MODIFY

    Reason Phrase: Not applicable.

6.2.  Target Header Registration

   As per Section 22.4.2 of [1], this specification registers the RTSP
   Target header for use with RTSP methods.  The information to be added
   to the registry is:


     RFCXXXX: This specification serves as registration for the Target
              header.

     Header Name: Target

   target device to which the RTSP streaming session would be
   transferred.

   Here the source RTSP device that wants to transfer the RTSP session
   to the destination device, generates a RTSP MODIFY method request
   specifying its intention to transfer the session in the RTSP Require
   header and the address of the destination device in the RTSP Target
   header.  The RTSP server upon receiving the MODIFY request from the
   source device would use any available mechanism to indicate to the
   destination device about a pending session request.  The destination
   device would then setup a streaming session with the server.  The
   flow of messages depicting this mechanism is shown below.


   For the purpose of the message flow, C means source RTSP device,
                                        S means RTSP server and

A.2.  Media Session Sharing

   This is an example of sharing a media streaming session with another
   RTSP device.  For the purpose of this example, the source RTSP device
   is the device that actually originated the RTSP streaming session
   with the server, while the destination RTSP device is the target
   device with which the RTSP streaming session would be shared.

   Here the source RTSP device that wants to share the RTSP session with
   the destination device, generates a RTSP MODIFY method request
   specifying its intention to share the session in the RTSP Require
   header and the address of the destination device in the RTSP Target
   header.  The RTSP server upon receiving the MODIFY request from the
   source device would use any available mechanism to indicate to the
   destination device about a pending session request.  The destination
   device would then setup a streaming session with the server.  The
   flow of messages depicting this mechanism is shown below.
