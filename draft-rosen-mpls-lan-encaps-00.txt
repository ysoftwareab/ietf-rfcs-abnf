Abstract

   ''Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)'' [1,2,3] requires a set of
   procedures for augmenting network layer packets with ''label stacks'',
   thereby turning them into ''labeled packets'' [4].  Routers which
   support MPLS are known as ''Label Switching Routers'', or ''LSRs''.  In
   order to transmit a labeled packet on a particular data link, an LSR
   must support an encoding technique which, given a label stack and a
   network layer packet, produces a labeled packet.  This document

1. Introduction

   "Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)" [1,2,3] requires a set of
   procedures for augmenting network layer packets with "label stacks",
   thereby turning them into "labeled packets" [4].  Routers which
   support MPLS are known as "Label Switching Routers", or "LSRs".  In
   order to transmit a labeled packet on a particular data link, an LSR
   must support an encoding technique which, given a label stack and a
   network layer packet, produces a labeled packet.

   This document specifies the encoding to be used by an LSR in order to
   transmit labeled packets on LAN data links.


1.1. Specification of Requirements

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.

        MUST

        This word, or the adjective "required", means that the
        definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.

        MUST NOT

        This phrase means that the definition is an absolute prohibition
        of the specification.

        SHOULD

        This word, or the adjective "recommended", means that there may
        exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore this
        item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully
        weighed before choosing a different course.

        MAY

        This word, or the adjective "optional", means that this item is
        one of an allowed set of alternatives.  An implementation which
        does not include this option MUST be prepared to interoperate
        with another implementation which does include the option.


2. Transporting Labeled Packets over LAN Media

   The label stack MUST be represented and processed as specified in
   [4].

   Each LAN frame that carries a labeled packet MUST carry exactly one
   labeled packet.

   The label stack entries MUST immediately precede the network layer
   header, and MUST follow any data link layer headers, including, e.g.,
   any VLAN headers, 802.1Q headers, etc. that may exist.

   The ethertype value 8847 hex is used to indicate that a frame is
   carrying an MPLS unicast packet.

   The ethertype value 8848 hex is used to indicate that a frame is
   carrying an MPLS multicast packet.

   These ethertype values can be used with either the ethernet
   encapsulation or the 802.3 SNAP/SAP encapsulation to carry labeled
   packets.

   The procedures for processing labeled packets are as specified in
   [4].


3. Security Considerations

   Security considerations are not discussed in this document.
