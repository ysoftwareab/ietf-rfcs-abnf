Assertion Values for a Resource Priority Header Claim and a SIP Priority
         Header Claim in Support of Emergency Services Networks
               draft-ietf-stir-rph-emergency-services-02

Abstract

   This document adds new assertion values for a Resource Priority
   Header ("rph") claim and a new SIP Priority Header claim ("sph") for
   protection of the "psap-callback" value as part of the "rph" PASSporT
   extension, in support of the security of Emergency Services Networks
   for emergency call origination and callback.

1.  Introduction

   Personal Assertion Token (PASSporT) Extension for Resource Priority
   Authorization [RFC8443] extended the Personal Assertion Token
   (PASSporT) specification defined in [RFC8225] to allow the inclusion
   of cryptographically signed assertions of authorization for the
   values populated in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) "Resource-
   Priority" header field [RFC4412], which is used for communications
   resource prioritization and the SIP "Priority" header field, used for
   categorizing the priority use of the call.

   Compromise of the SIP "Resource-Priority" header field could lead to
   misuse of network resources (i.e., during congestion scenarios),
   impacting the application services supported using the SIP "Resource-
   Priority" header field.

   [RFC8225] allows extensions by which an authority on the originating
   side verifying the authorization of a particular communication for
   the SIP "Resource-Priority" header field or the SIP "Priority" header
   field can use PASSPorT claims to cryptographically sign the
   information associated with either the SIP "Resource-Priority" or
   "Priority" header fields and convey assertion of those values by the
   signing party authorization.  A signed SIP "Resource-Priority" or
   "Priority" header fields will allow a receiving entity (including
   entities located in different network domains/boundaries) to verify

   the validity of assertions to act on the information with confidence
   that the information has not been spoofed or compromised.

   This document adds new assertion values for a Resource Priority
   Header ("rph") claim defined in [RFC8443], in support of Emergency
   Services Networks for emergency call origination and callback.  This
   document also defines a new claim, "sph", including protection of the
   SIP Priority header for the indication of an emergency service call-
   back assigned the value "psap-callback" as defined in [RFC7090].  The
   use of these new assertion values for real-time communications
   supported using the SIP 'Resource-Priority' and 'Priority' header
   fields for emergency services is introduced in
   [I-D.rosen-stir-emergency-calls] but otherwise out-of-scope of this
   document.  In addition, the PASSPorT claims and values defined in
   this document are intended for use in environments where there are
   means to verify that the signer of the SIP 'Resource-Priority' and
   'Priority' header fields is authoritative.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  New Assertion Values for "rph" claim

   This specification defines new assertions values for:

   *  "ESorig": Emergency Services call origination
   *  "EScallback": Emergency Services callback.

3.1.  ESorig

   When using "ESorig" as the "rph" assertion value, the "orig" claim of
   the PASSporT MUST represent the calling party number that initiates
   the call to emergency services.  The "dest" claim MUST either be a
   country or region specific dial string (e.g., "911" for North America
   or "112" GSM defined string used in Europe and other countries) or
   "urn:service:sos" as defined in TBD, representing the emergency
   services destination of the call.

   The following is an example of an "rph" claim for SIP 'Resource-
   Priority' header field with a "ESorig" assertion:






Dolly & Wendt           Expires January 14, 2021                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft      RPH Values for Emergency Services          July 2020


     {
       "orig":{"tn":"12155551212"},
       "dest":{["uri":"urn:service:sos"]},
       "iat":1443208345,
       "rph":{"ESorig":["esnet,x"]}
     }

3.2.  EScallback

   When using "EScallback" as the "rph" assertion value, the "orig"
   claim of the PASSporT MUST represent the emergency network telephone
   number.  The "dest" claim MUST be the telephone number representing
   the original calling party of the emergency service call that is
   being called back.

   The following is an example of an "rph" claim for SIP 'Resource-
   Priority' header field with a "EScallback" assertion:

     {
       "orig":{"tn":"12155551213"},
       "dest":{["tn":"12155551212"]},
       "iat":1443208345,
       "rph":{"EScallback":["esnet,x"]}
     }

   After the header and claims PASSporT objects have been constructed,
   their signature is generated normally per the guidance in [RFC8225]
   using the full form of PASSPorT.  The credentials (i.e., Certificate)
   used to create the signature must have authority over the namespace
   of the "rph" claim, and there is only one authority per claim.  The
   authority MUST use its credentials associated with the specific
   service supported by the resource priority namespace in the claim.
   If r-values are added or dropped by the intermediaries along the
   path, the intermediaries must generate a new "rph" header and sign
   the claim with their own authority.

4.  The SIP Priority header "sph" claim

   As discussed in [I-D.rosen-stir-emergency-calls], and as defined in
   [RFC7090] the SIP Priority header may be set to the value "psap-
   callback" for emergency services callback calls.  Because some SIP
   networks may act on this value and provide priority or other special
   routing based on this value, it is important to protect and validate
   the authoritative use associated with it.

   Therefore, we define a new claim key as part of the "rph" PASSporT,
   "sph", which MUST be used only for authorized emergency callbacks and
   correspond to a SIP Priority header with the value "psap-callback".

Internet-Draft      RPH Values for Emergency Services          July 2020


   The value of the "sph" claim key should only be "psap-callback" to
   match the SIP Priority header field value for authorized emergency
   services callbacks.

   The following is an example of an "sph" claim for SIP 'Priority'
   header field with the value "psap-callback":

     {
       "orig":{"tn":"12155551213"},
       "dest":{["tn":"12155551212"]},
       "iat":1443208345,
       "rph":{"EScallback":["esnet,x"]},
       "sph":"psap-callback"
     }

5.  Order of Claim Keys

   The order of the claim keys MUST follow the rules of [RFC8225]
   Section 9; the claim keys MUST appear in lexicographic order.
   Therefore, the claim keys discussed in this document appear in the
   PASSporT Payload in the following order,

   o  dest

   o  iat

   o  orig

   o  rph

   o  sph

6.  Compact Form of PASSporT

   The use of the compact form of PASSporT is not specified in this
   document or recommended for 'rph' PASSporTs.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  PASSporT Resource Priority Header (rph) Types

   This specification requests that the IANA add two new assertion
   values to the "PASSporT Resource Priority Header (rph) Types"
   Registry as defined in [RFC8443].

   The following assertion values will be added to the registry:

   JSON Web Token Claims registry as defined in [RFC7519].
