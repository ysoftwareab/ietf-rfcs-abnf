1.  Introduction

   Note: Efforts to synchronize structure and terminology with
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry] will likely be incomplete until both
   drafts are stable.

   This memo proposes a (set of) entry(ies) for the Performance Metric
   Registry, based on Model-Based Metrics (MBM).  It uses terms and
   definitions from the IPPM literature, primarily [RFC2330].

2.  Scope

   This document defines one of the initial set of Performance Metrics
   Registry entries, for which IETF approval (following development in
   the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Working Group) will satisfy the
   requirement for Expert Review.  Note that all are Active Performance
   Metrics, which are based on RFCs prepared in the IPPM working group
   of the IETF, according to their framework [RFC2330] and its updates.

3.  MBM Registry Entry

   This section gives an initial registry entry for a Model-Based Metric
   (MBM) Sustained Burst Metric.

3.2.  Metric Definition

   This category includes columns to prompt the entry of all necessary
   details related to the metric definition, including the RFC reference
   and values of input factors, called fixed parameters.

3.2.1.  Reference Definition

   <Full bibliographic reference to an immutable doc.>

   <specific section reference and additional clarifications, if needed>

   Mathis, M. and A.  Morton, "Model Based Metrics for Bulk Transport
   Capacity", draft-ietf-ippm-model-based- metrics-10 (work in
   progress), February 2017.

   The primary metrics of measurement are round-trip delay and one-way
   loss, measured under the conditions described in Section 8.5.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-model-based-metrics].

   For loss:

   Almes, G., Kalidini, S., Zekauskas, M., and A.  Morton, Ed., "A One-
   Way Loss Metric for IP Performance Metrics (IPPM)", RFC 7680, DOI
   10.17487/RFC7680, January 2016, <http://www.rfc-editor.org/info/
   rfc7680>.

   Section 2.4 of [RFC7680] provides the reference definition of the
   singleton (single value) one-way loss metric.  Section 3.4 of
   [RFC7680] provides the reference definition expanded to cover a
   multi-singleton sample.  Note that terms such as singleton and sample
   are defined in Section 11 of [RFC2330].

   For round-trip delay:

   Almes, G., Kalidindi, S., and M.  Zekauskas, "A One-way Packet Loss
   Metric for IPPM", RFC 2680, September 1999.

   [RFC2681]

   Almes, G., Kalidindi, S., Zekauskas, M., and A.  Morton, Ed., "A One-
   Way Delay Metric for IP Performance Metrics (IPPM)", STD 81, RFC
   7679, DOI 10.17487/RFC7679, January 2016, <http://www.rfc-
   editor.org/info/rfc7679>.

   [RFC7679]

   <specific section reference and additional clarifications, if needed>

   Section 2.4 of [RFC2681] provides the reference definition of the
   singleton (single value) Round-trip delay metric.  Section 3.4 of
   [RFC2681] provides the reference definition expanded to cover a
   multi-singleton sample.  Note that terms such as singleton and sample
   are defined in Section 11 of [RFC2330].

   Note that although the definition of "Round-trip-Delay between Src
   and Dst" is directionally ambiguous in the text, this metric tightens
   the definition further to recognize that the host in the "Src" role
   will send the first packet to "Dst", and ultimately receive the
   corresponding return packet from "Dst" (when neither are lost).

   Finally, note that the variable "dT" is used in [RFC2681] to refer to
   the value of Round-trip delay in metric definitions and methods.  The
   variable "dT" has been re-used in other IPPM literature to refer to
   different quantities, and cannot be used as a global variable name
   here.

3.2.2.  Fixed Parameters

   <list and specify Fixed Parameters, input factors that must be
   determined and embedded in the measurement system for use when
   needed>

   Type-P as defined in Section 13 of [RFC2330]:

   o  IPv4 header values:

      *  DSCP: set to 0

      *  TTL: set to 255

      *  Protocol: Set to 6 (TCP)

   o  IPv6 header values:

      *  DSCP: set to 0

      *  Hop Count: set to 255

      *  Protocol: Set to 6 (TCP)

   o  TCP header values:

      *  Checksum: the checksum MUST be calculated and included in the
         header

   o  TCP Payload

      *  see target_MTU in Run-time parameters.

   Other measurement parameters:

   o  Tmax: a loss threshold waiting time @@@@ Should this be linked to
      TCP RTO, or target_RTT plus a factor ???

      *  3.0, expressed in units of seconds, as a positive value of type
         decimal64 with fraction digits = 4 (see section 9.3 of
         [RFC6020]) and with resolution of 0.0001 seconds (0.1 ms), with
         lossless conversion to/from the 32-bit NTP timestamp as per
         section 6 of [RFC5905].

3.3.  Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of
   the RFC(s) and any supplemental information needed to ensure an
   unambiguous methods for implementations.

3.3.1.  Reference Method

   <for metric, insert relevant section references and supplemental
   info>

   The method of measurement is described in Section 8.5.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-model-based-metrics].

   The example described in Section 9 of
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-model-based-metrics] may also help.

3.3.2.  Packet Stream Generation

   <list of generation parameters and section/spec references if needed>

   The stream generation parameters are described in Section 3 of
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-model-based-metrics].  They are dependent on the
   target parameters described in the Run-time parameters section below.
   They are written here with underscores because they are used in
   formulas in this note.

   @@@@ I strongly suggest decimal64 fraction digits = 9 or 12 (i.e
   nanoseconds or picoseconds).  I point out that the average headway
   for min sized packets on 100Gb/s is already down to 5.1 uS.  In
   either case for decimal64 the max headway is way longer than ever
   needed (decades or months). --MM-- (@@@@ BTW I think your fraction
   digits are off --MM--).

   @@@@ This section has a general problem that it need to better
   prescribe generic concepts (headway, sizes, rates) and then define
   multiple distinct parameters needed to properly specify each pattern.

   packet_headway  Time interval between packets, specified from the
      start of one to the start of the next, as a positive value of type
      decimal64 with fraction digits = 9 seconds, for a resolution of 1
      nanosecond. (see section 9.3 of [RFC6020]). @@@@ We need a
      convention for "back to back" independent of clock accuracy.--MM--

   burst_headway  Time interval between bursts, specified from the start
      of the first packet one burst to the start of the first packet of
      the next burst, specified as a positive value of type decimal64
      with fraction digits = 9 seconds, for a resolution of 1
      nanosecond. (see section 9.3 of [RFC6020]).

   paced_single_packets  Send individual packets at the specified packet
      headway, specified as a positive value of type decimal64 with
      fraction digits = 9 seconds, for a resolution of 1 nanosecond.
      (see section 9.3 of [RFC6020]). @@@@ NB: I dropped rate.--MM--

   paced_bursts  Send bursts on a timer.  Specify any 3 of: average data
      rate, packet size, burst size (number of packets) and burst
      headway (burst start to start), specified as a positive value of
      type decimal64 with fraction digits = 9 seconds, for a resolution
      of 1 nanosecond. (see section 9.3 of [RFC6020]).

   slowstart_rate  The average data rate necessary to mimic TCP
      slowstart by sending 4 packet paced bursts to mimic a two level
      burst pattern as described in Section 6.1 of
      [I-D.ietf-ippm-model-based-metrics].  This rate should be chosen

      to be twice the implied bottleneck IP capacity (but not more than
      the sender interface rate).  The slowstart_rate is specified as a
      value of type uint32 (see section 9.2 of [RFC6020]) in units of
      IP-layer bytes per second.

   slowstart_burst  Mimic one round of TCP slowstart by sending a
      specified number of packets in a two level burst pattern that
      resembles slowstart, specified as a number of type uint16 (see
      section 9.2 of [RFC6020]) in units of packets, and a rate
      specified as a value of type uint16 (see section 9.2 of [RFC6020])
      in units of packets per second.

   repeated_slowstart_burst  Repeat Slowstart bursts once per
      target_RTT.  All Slowstart bursts are the same size in
      measurements (different from normal TCP sending behavior),
      specified as a value of type boolean (see section 9.5 of
      [RFC6020]). @@@@@ I would change this to [slowestart] burst
      headway, nominally an interval mimicking the RTT and long enough
      to permit all of the queues to drain between slowstart bursts.

3.3.3.  Traffic Filtering (observation) Details

   <insert the measured results based on a filtered version of the
   packets observed, and this section provides the filter details (when
   present), and section reference>.

   NA

3.3.4.  Sampling Distribution

   <insert time distribution details, or how this is diff from the
   filter>

   NA

3.3.5.  Run-time Parameters and Data Format

   <list of run-time parameters, and any reference(s)>.

   The following parameters are described in [RFC2330]

   Src  the IP address of the host in the Src Role (format ipv4-address-
      no-zone value for IPv4, or ipv6-address-no-zone value for IPv6,
      see Section 4 of [RFC6991])

   Dst  the IP address of the host in the Dst Role (format ipv4-address-
      no-zone value for IPv4, or ipv6-address-no-zone value for IPv6,
      see section 4 of [RFC6991])

   T0 a time, the start of a measurement interval, (format "date-and-
      time" as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], see also Section 3
      of [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of
      [RFC2330].  When T0 is "all-zeros", a start time is unspecified
      and Tf is to be interpreted as the Duration of the measurement
      interval.  The start time is controlled through other means.

   The authors thank Brian Trammell for suggesting the term "Run-time
   Parameters", which led to the distinction between run-time and fixed
   parameters implemented in this memo, for identifying the IPFIX metric
   with Flow Key as an example, and for many other productive
   suggestions.  Thanks to Peter Koch, who provided several useful
   suggestions for disambiguating successive DNS Queries in the DNS
   Response time metric.

   The authors also acknowledge the constructive reviews and helpful
   suggestions from Barbara Stark, Juergen Schoenwaelder, Tim Carey, and
   participants in the LMAP working group.
