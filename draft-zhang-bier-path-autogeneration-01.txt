1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture] BIER is a technology of multicast flow
   forwarding.  [I-D.ietf-bier-mpls-encapsulation] introduces a way to
   use mpls in BIER forwarding.  This document introduces a method of
   establishing multicast path automatically.

   Upstream-assigned label is used in this document.  Associate with the
   label indicated the BFIR, the two labels compose the keywords for
   multicast flow forwarding.  Every node along the multicast path used
   the two labels to forward multicast flow without label changing.
   Obviously, the nodes along the path establish the mpls forwarding
   table, when they receive the packet which include the label
   combination and the path specification.

   BFIR sends the first packet with label combination and path
   specification, every node along the path build the mpls forwarding
   table, and forward the packet to next node according to the path
   specification.  If there is already one mpls forwarding item which
   has the same label combination, the node combines the next-hop in the
   packet to the existed forwarding item.

2.  Packet Formats

   This document introduces a new TLV that is carried by the BIER
   packet, and this TLV is composed by the nodes in the multicast path.
   There is a flag in the BIER header indicates that a path TLV is be
   carried.  One of the reserved flag may be used to signal this.

2.1.  Node function

   The path list is composed by nodes along the multicast path.  The
   multicast path is decided by BFIR in advance through PCE or other
   calculations or configurations.

   o  Id The node BFR-id or the link id along the multicast path.  They
      are carried by the packets in order.

   o  BFER-id The BFR-id of BFER.

   Like the ingress replication, BFIR repeats BIER packets several times
   according to every BFER of the multicast flow.  And then BFIR sends
   the BIER packets with the two labels.

   The withdraw packet is the same format with the path packet.  But the
   type should be another type, and the last node that is carried by the
   withdraw packet is the canceled node.

2.2.  TE function

   Also, the method of path auto-generation can be used in BIER-TE
   forwarding.

   The format of TLV that is carried by BIER header is same as the
   previous section.  And the difference is that the BitString is BIER-
   TE forwarding BitString.  The packet is forwarding by the BIER-TE
   Forwarding Table.

   o  BitString The adjacency of TE path, and it is the same as the
      BitString in the BIER header.

   When the multicast flow travels the BIER-TE path by BIER-TE
   forwarding, the two level labels also can be established in every
   BFR.  If some adjacency should be withdrawn from the path, the type
   will be another type of TE path withdraw TLV.

3.  Procedures

3.1.  Node procedure

3.1.1.  Sending the path packets

   When BFIR gains the BFER information of a specific multicast flow,
   BFIR encapsulates the receiving flow with the path list, and sends to
   every BFER individually.Particularly, the encapsulated packet that is
   sent by BFIR includes the label combination.

                       B-------- C ------ D --------
                       |         |        |        |
                       A ------- F ------ G ------ H
                       |         |        |        |
                       --------- K ------ L -------M
                            Figure4 An Example

   For example, in figure 3, A is BFIR for a specific multicast flow.
   And D, H, M is BFER.  According the PCE calculation, the multicast
   flow should be sent along these paths: A-F-G-D/H, A-K-L-M.  So A
   encapsulates the flow with the two label combination and makes three
   copies, and then sends to D/H/M separately.  In node A, there is one
   mpls label forwarding item which the ingress label is the two labels
   combination, and the next-hops are F and K with the same two labels
   out.  A encapsulates the formal multicast flow with the two labels
   and forwards to next hops.

   For the stability consideration, BFIR sends the path packets every
   once in a while.  The interval may be 30 minutes.  And when new BFER
   joined, BFIR sends the path packets to the new BFER immediately.

3.1.2.  Withdraw Nodes

   According to the PCE calculation, some existed nodes in the path may
   be canceled.  BFIR sends the withdraw path packet which the last node
   is the canceled node.

   For example in figure 1, if the bandwidth in the network is changed,
   the multicast flow should be forwarded along these ways: A-B-C-D-H,



Zhang, et al.           Expires September 7, 2016               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft         Path Autogeneration in BIER            March 2016


   A-K-L-M.  The specific multicast flow will not pass by the node F and
   G anymore.  Except A sending a new path packet along the path
   A-B-C-D-H, A also sends two withdraw path packets to node F and G.

3.1.3.  BFR and BFER

   When BFR and BFER receive the path packets, they build an item in the
   mpls forwarding table according to the label combination that is
   carried by the packets.  If there is an item already in the
   forwarding table, the nodes should add the next-hop which is the next
   node in the path packet.

   When BFR and BFER receive the withdraw path packets which indicate
   that they should be canceled, the BFR and BFER delete the mpls
   forwarding item which line with the label combination.  If the middle
   node finds that the next node that along the path is the canceled
   node, the middle node deletes the next-hop in the mpls forwarding
   item.  If there is no next-hop in the mpls forwarding item, the node
   deletes the mpls item in the mpls forwarding table.

3.2.  BIER-TE procedure

3.2.1.  Sending the path packets

   When BFIR gains the BFER information of a specific multicast flow,
   and BFIR knows all the adjacencies that the flow should travel, BFIR
   encapsulates the receiving flow with the BIER-TE adjacencies, and
   sends to BIER domain.  If there are several SI should be
   encapsulated, the flow will be encapsulated by different BitString
   several times.

                            Figure 5 BIER-TE example

   For example, in figure 4, A is BFIR for a specific multicast flow.
   And D, H, M is BFER.  According the PCE calculation, the multicast
   flow should be sent along these paths: A-F-G-D/H, A-K-L-M.  The
   BitPositions in BitString are p8, p10, p12, p14, p16, p21, p23.  A
   encapsulates the flow with the two label combination and the BIER-TE
   BitString.

   Like the node function, when the packet goes through the path of
   BIER-TE, every BFR establishes the label forwarding item.

3.2.2.  Withdraw BIER-TE adjacencies

   If some adjacencies in the existed path should be withdraw, the
   ingress node send the packet with withdraw type of TLV.  The
   BitString in BIER header is previous TE path adjacency, and the
   BitString in the TLV is composed of withdraw adjacencies.  When BFR
   receives the packet, BFR will withdraw the associated adjacencies
   itself.

4.  Security Considerations

   There should be some common security methods to guarantee the
   validation of path packets.

5.  IANA considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate four types in TLVs of BIER path
   packets.  Two for node function and two for TE function.
