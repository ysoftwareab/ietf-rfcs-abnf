RFC              Regional Routing Protocol (RRP)        April 28, 2017



1.  Introduction


    - Regional Routing Protocol (RRP) is an Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) that
      introduces a new way of routing IP packets from the source to the destination
      through different Autonomous Systems (ASs).
    - The Internet will be subdivided into logical regions or by the physical
      location of continents.
    - The routing process that Regional Routing Protocol (RRP) uses is based on the
      RRP Region Number (RN), the RRP Autonomous System Number (ASN), Best Path Algorithm
      (AS Path) and the efforts made by the IGP within each AS.
    - The major difference between RRP and BGP is that RRP does not uses a large table
      with hundreds of thousands of entries (BGP Table) stored within each Internet router,
      instead of that, it uses a smarter way of routing based on the RRP RN, RRP ASN
      stored within each IP address, Best Path Algorithm (AS Path) and the efforts already
      being done by each IGP within an AS.




2. Regional Routing Protocol (RRP)


    - RRP uses new terms that can be defined as follows:


    * Region Number (RN):


   - The 1st hex digit of the 2nd group of an IPv6 address determines on which RN this IPv6
     address is located.
   - The 1st octet of an IPv4 address determines on which RN this IPv4 address is located.
   - The table that will be used listing the Region Number (RN), the corresponding IPv6
     2nd group 1st hex digits and the IPv4 1st octet pool of numbers is called the
     Region Number Table (RNT) and is stored on every RRP router and is as follows:


     **********************************************************************************************
     *  Region Number  *  1st Hex Digit of the 2nd IPv6 Group   *  1st IPv4 Octet Decimal Digits  * 
     **********************************************************************************************  
     *        1        *             0 - 5 - A - F              *            ARIN Pool            *        
     **********************************************************************************************  
     *        2        *             1 - 6 - B                  *          RIPE NCC Pool          *        
     **********************************************************************************************  
     *        3        *             2 - 7 - C                  *           AFRINIC Pool          *        
     **********************************************************************************************  
     *        4        *             3 - 8 - D                  *            APNIC Pool           *        
     **********************************************************************************************  
     *        5        *             4 - 9 - E                  *           LACNIC Pool           *        
     **********************************************************************************************



    * Regional Boarder Router (RBR) ==> A router in a region that has
                                        at least one interface connected
                                        to a router's interface in another
                                        region.


    * Regional Router (RR) ==> - A router in a region and has all interfaces
                                 connected to other routers in the same
                                 region.

                               - A router in a local AS that has at least
                                 one interface connected to a different AS.
                                

    * Local RRP AS Router (LRAR) ==> A router in an AS that has all interfaces
                                     connected to other routers in the same AS.



   - Each RBR and RR is configured with a Region Number (RN) that identifies
     in which region that router is located. 
   - All RBRs and RRs interfaces will be assigned by default to the configured
     Region Number (RN).
   
   - The two connected RRP routers exchange their RNs: 

       1) If they are the same, the two RRP routers are RRs.
       2) If they are different, the two RRP routers are RBRs.

  
   - The two connected RRP routers exchange their RRP ASNs:

       1) If they are the same, the two RRP routers are LRARs.
       2) If they are different, the two RRP routers are RRs.

3. RRP Forwarding Mechanism



   - The RRP ASN is represented as follows:

     a) The 2nd two groups of an IPv6 address is represented as follows:

                   xxxx|yyyy|yyyy|yyyy:yyyy|yyyy|yyyy|yyyy     Binary Format
                                   
                                  XYYY:YYYY                 Hexadecimal Format

       where X hex digit is associated with a specific Region Number (RN).
       and YYY:YYYY hex digits represents the KRP Autonomous System Number (ASN).



     b) The 1st two octets of an IPv4 address is represented as follows:

                             yyyyyyyy.yyyyyyyy      Binary Format

                                   YY.YY          Hexadecimal Format

      where YY.YY hex digits represents the RRP Autonomous System Number (ASN).

     Note:- - The Region Number (RN) is unique for every region.
            - The RRP ASN must be unique for every AS.
            - For IPv4, the 1st two octets are represented in decimal in the IPv4 address
              itself, but the RRP ASN is represented in 4 hexadecimal digits.



    - There are 3 types of tables, 2 RBR messages and 1 RR message that RRP uses for
      forwarding a packet:


     a) RRP router Regional Table (RT):


    - Each RBR and RR creates its own Regional Table (RT).
    - The Regional Table (RT) is as follows:


     **********************************************************************
     * Local RN * Remote RN * Traffic Class * Local RRP ASN * RBR RRP ASN * 
     **********************************************************************  
     *          *           *               *               *             *
     **********************************************************************

     ***************************************************************************



    c) RRP router IGP Routing Table (IRT):


     *********************************************************************
     * Prefix (Subnet) * Metric * Output Interface * Next-hop IP Address * 
     ********************************************************************* 
     *                 *        *                  *             *       *      
     *********************************************************************
