1. Introduction

      This document defines the initial version of the iana-af-numbers
   YANG module for address family numbers definitions.

      The iana-af-numbers module reflects IANA's existing "address
   family numbers definitions" registry [Address Family Numbers].  The
   latest revision of the module can be obtained from the IANA web site.

      New values should be made to IANA and added to the "address family
   numbers definitions" registry, the IANA-ADDRESS-FAMILY-NUMBERS-MIB
   and the iana-af-numbers YANG module are updated by IANA.

3. IANA Considerations

      This document defines the initial version of the IANA-maintained
   iana-af-numbers YANG module.

      The iana-af-numbers YANG module is intended to reflect the
   "address family numbers definitions" registry [ADDRESS FAMILY
   NUMBERS-IANA-REGISTRY], exactly like the IANA address family numbers-
   MIB module [IANA-ADDRESS-FAMILY-NUMBERS-MIB] reflects the "address
   family numbers definitions" registry.




Chen                  Expires November 22, 2017              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft IANA Address Family Numbers Yang Model         May 2017


      New address family number value must not be directly added to the
   iana-af-numbers YANG module.  They must instead be added to the
   "address family numbers definitions" registry.

      When an address family number is added to the "address family
   numbers definitions" registry, a new "identity" statement must be
   added to the iana-af-numbers YANG module.  The name of the "identity"
   is the same as the corresponding enumeration in the IANA-ADDRESS-
   FAMILY-NUMBERS-MIB.  The following substatements to the "identity"
   statement should be defined:

         "base": Contains the value "iana-af-numbers".

         "status": Include only if a registration has been deprecated
         (use the value "deprecated") or obsoleted (use the value
         "obsolete").

         "description": Replicate the description from the registry, if
         any.  Insert line breaks as needed so that the line does not
         exceed 72 characters.

         "reference": Replicate the reference from the registry, if any,
         and add the title of the document.

      Unassigned or reserved values are not present in the module.

      When the iana-af-numbers YANG module is updated, a new "revision"
   statement must be added in front of the existing revision statements.

      IANA has added this new note to the "address family numbers
   definitions" registry:

         When this registry is modified, the YANG module iana-af-numbers
   must be updated.

      The "Reference" text in the "address family numbers definitions"
   registry should add this new RFC.

   3.1.  URI Registrations

      This document registers a URI in the "IETF XML" registry
   [RFC3688].

      Following the format in RFC 3688, the following registration has
   been made.

         URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:iana-af-numbers

Internet-Draft IANA Address Family Numbers Yang Model         May 2017


         Registrant Contact: IANA.

         XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   3.2.  YANG Module Registrations

      This document registers a YANG module in the "YANG Module Names"

      registry [RFC7950].

         name:         iana-af-numbers

         namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:iana-af-numbers

         prefix:       ianaafn



4. Security Considerations

   The YANG module definitions does not create any security
   implications.
