         Authoritative DNS-over-TLS Operational Considerations
              draft-hal-adot-operational-considerations-02

Abstract

   DNS over TLS (DoT) has been gaining attention, primarily as a means
   of communication between stub resolvers and recursive resolvers.
   There have also been discussions and experiments involving the use of
   DoT to communicate with authoritative nameservers (Authoritative DNS
   over TLS or "ADoT"), including communication between recursive and
   authoritative resolvers.  However, we have identified a number of
   operational concerns with ADoT that have arisen as DNS operators have
   begun to experiment with and prepare for deploying DoT.  These
   operational concerns need to be addressed prior to ADoT's deployment
   at scale by DNS operators in order to maintain the stability and
   resilience of the global DNS.  The document also provides some
   suggested next steps to advance the operator community's
   understanding of ADoT's operational impact.

Internet-Draft       ADoT Operational Considerations         August 2019


1.  Introduction

   This is an operational considerations document that focuses on the
   factors operators need to consider when implementing Authoritative
   DNS over TLS.  An evaluation of the merits of DNS over TLS are beyond
   the scope and intent of this document.

   Typically, DNS communication between stub resolvers, recursive
   resolvers, and authoritative servers is not encrypted.  Some argue
   that this can pose a privacy challenge for Internet users, because
   their access to named network resources can potentially be tracked
   through their DNS communication.  In principle, any network element
   along the path between the user and resolving or authoritative
   nameservers could observe this unencrypted traffic.  Many of these
   concerns are addressed in [RFC7626].

   [RFC8310] proposes using DNS over TLS (DoT) in order to encrypt DNS
   traffic between hosts.

   Historically, much of the work on DNS encryption has focused on the
   stub-to-recursive path, as the recursive-to-authoritative server path
   did not leak user specific information, other than if identifying
   information was encoded in the QName.  However, with the increased
   deployment of EDNS0 Client Subnet [RFC7871], recursive-to-
   authoritative encryption is becoming an area of interest.  Therefore,
   this document's scope is the recursive-to-authoritative aspect of
   DoT, or Authoritative DNS over TLS (ADoT), in order to differentiate
   it from the stub-to-recursive path.

   The addition of ADoT, while providing encryption for DNS
   communication, also introduces other factors that might impact the
   stability and resiliency of authoritative nameserver operations which
   may have been optimized for unencrypted DNS, often focusing on UDP
   transport.

   The objective of this document is to try to describe the problem
   space, make suggestions about solutions, and propose next steps that
   can help inform both recursive and authoritative operators on how to
   assess and address the challenges posed by ADoT deployment.

1.1.  Background and Motivation

1.1.1.  Why operational considerations are so important for ADoT

   The main concerns for most authoritative operators are the stability,
   resiliency, scalability, and performance of their platforms.  These
   concerns need to be weighed against the benefits, provided to the end
   user, by encrypting DNS queries to the authoritative servers.



Henderson, et al.       Expires February 14, 2020               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft       ADoT Operational Considerations         August 2019


   As a result of caching, the recursive-to-authoritative server
   communication is less attributable to a particular user than
   information communicated along the stub-to-recursive path.  In cases
   where the recursive is shared and using QName minimization, some user
   privacy concerns may be addressed, but cases exist where QName
   Minimization may not be used, or users may be running their own
   resolver, defeating the shared service proection.

   Initial deployments of ADoT may offer an immediate expansion of the
   attack surface (additional port, transport protocol, and
   computationally expensive crypto operations for an attacker to
   exploit) while, in some cases, providing limited protection to end
   users.

1.1.2.  Other considerations related to ADoT

   As resolvers add encryption on the client-to-recursive path, they may
   also change the way they handle data on the recursive-to-
   authoritative path.  This is expressed in Mozilla Trusted Recursive
   Resolver (TRR) requirements [1], for example, which require
   participating resolvers to perform QNAME minimization [RFC7816], and
   TRR requirement #6, which forbids the EDNS0 Client subnet (ECS) from
   being propagated unless the recursive-to-authoritative path is
   encrypted.

   The latter requirement may have the possible unintended consequence
   of reducing the authoritative name servers' ability to provide a best
   response to DNS queries, until such time as they deploy DNS
   encryption.

   Given that recursive resolvers should be configured to prevent ECS
   transmission to root, top-level, and effective top-level domain (TLD)
   servers [RFC7871] section 12.1 [2] - the ECS encryption requirement
   motivates consideration of authoritative DNS encryption below these
   levels.

   At the higher levels, techniques such as QNAME minimization and
   Aggressive Use of DNSSEC-Validated Cache [RFC8198] arguably provide
   an alternate path toward mitigating the risk of disclosure of
   sensitive information without the operational risk of DNS encryption.

   Resolver requirements may change as the understanding of DNS
   encryption options evolve, but in the meantime, they provide
   motivation for authoritative name server operators to weigh the risks
   and benefits of DNS encryption, hence the importance of understanding
   these operational considerations.

2.  Terminology

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.2.  Definitions

   Authoritative DoT (ADoT): [I-D.draft-hoffman-dns-terminology-ter-01]

   Attack Surface: The sum of attack vectors where an unauthorized user
   (attacker) can try to enter or extract data from the environment or
   compromise a service via resource starvation.

   Authoritative Operator: An operator of an authoritative DNS server.

   CDN: Content Delivery Network - distributed network of servers which
   proxy traffic between content providers and end users in order to
   provide high availability and high performance.

   ECS: EDNS0 Client Subnet [RFC7871] - an extension to EDNS0 where the
   client's subnet is included in the DNS query, intended to provide a
   hint to authoritative servers who may wish to provide different
   answers in an attempt to provide higher performance for end users
   based on their network location.

   EPSK: External Pre-Shared Key - TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] uses the same PSK
   extension for keys established both during handshake (resumption PSK)
   and keys established externally.  The EPSK acronym was introduced in
   draft [I-D.draft-wood-tls-external-psk-importer-00] in order to
   disambiguate External vs Resumption PSKs.

   Performance:

   o  QRTT: Query Round-Trip Time - the time it takes between sending a
      query and receiving a response.

   o  Best Response - whether or not the authoritative server, if
      dynamic responses are used as they are in CDNs, are able to
      determine or infer location and provide the most local response.
      It is a key part of the end-to-end performance for end users to
      get not just _an_ answer quickly but to get the best and most
      local answer.

   o  System Performance - the cost in system resources such as CPU/IO/
      Memory.

   o  Queries Per Second (QPS) - the maximum number of simultaneous
      queries that a DNS server can handle, on a per second basis.

   Authoritative Server - see [RFC8499]

   Recursive Resolver - see [RFC8499]

   Stub Resolver - see [RFC8499]

   SUDN: Special-Use Domain Names - see [RFC6761]

3.  Key Issues and Questions

3.1.  Signaling Support for ADoT

   [RFC8310] does not define a method for a nameserver to advertise its
   support of DoT other than to have the client make a connection
   attempt to the default port of 853.  The extra round-trip to check
   for ADoT support imposes a penalty for clients and resolvers that
   either do not remember the nameserver or have not communicated with
   that nameserver before.  The extra round-trip required may lead some
   implementers down a similar path to happy eyeballs [RFC8305] which,
   in the case of DNS, would send the same query over both encrypted and
   un-encrypted channels at the same time.  A happy eyeballs type
   approach, which we'll call "leaky resolvers", would defeat the
   purpose of the encryption protection for the testing query, but may
   enable subsequent queries to be sent over a private channel with the
   first query being subject to on-path adversaries.  An implementation
   could use some constant query string as a test query.  However any
   query included in the set of queries comprising the iterative
   resolution for a QNAME first sent over an encrypted channel that
   leaks the original stub QNAME, SHOULD NOT be used.

3.2.  Port number

   [RFC7858] section 3 [3] indicates that port 853 MUST be used for
   session establishment unless otherwise negotiated and configured by
   both the client and server.  In the stub-to-recursive connection,
   changing the port is something that can be done at stub configuration
   time however, managing this negotiation between the recursive-to-
   authoritative server is not scalable or standardized.  The
   scalability problem is due to the fact that recursive resolvers




Henderson, et al.       Expires February 14, 2020               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft       ADoT Operational Considerations         August 2019


   communicate with thousands of authoritative servers, therefore port/
   service discovery for each of these authoritatives becomes difficult.

   Static use of a pre-defined port provides on-path adversaries the
   ability to more easily drop or manipulate traffic intended for that
   port, possibly triggering resolvers to downgrade a connection back to
   a traditional DNS query, eliminating the encryption protections.
   This attack is more likely to happen on the stub-to-recursive
   connection but is also a possible threat for recursive-to-
   authoritative connections.

3.3.  TLS version

   Implementers of ADoT should read, understand, and follow the guidance
   provided in BCP195 [4], also known as [RFC7525], when deploying DoT
   on their platforms.  At the time of writing, [RFC7525] did not
   include coverage for TLS 1.3.  However, TLS 1.3 should be included in
   the document that obsoletes this BCP.  Until this happens, TLS 1.3
   SHOULD be preferred over TLS 1.2, as 1.3 offers both security and
   performance enhancements.  Additionally, operators should monitor TLS
   version issues and cipher suite vulnerabilities for the version of
   TLS that their platforms offer.

   In the absence of any widespread ADoT deployments, it is easier to
   limit TLS version 1.3 or greater.  The absence of widespread adoption
   also allows the IETF to create and enforce standards/policies that
   ensure TLS versions are kept current going forward.

3.4.  Resumptions

   TLS resumption allows clients and servers to use information from a
   previously established session in order to bootstrap the
   cryptographic state while avoiding a full handshake.  The resumption
   mechanism is redesigned in TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] section 2.2 [5] and
   section 2.3 [6], eliminating both [RFC5077] session tickets and
   session ID resumption.

   Resumption improves both connection and resource (socket and CPU)
   efficiency, therefore operators SHOULD allow for TLS resumption.
   However, special consideration should be given to 0-RTT resumption as
   it is vulnerable to replay attacks [RFC3552] see Section 3.3.1 [7].
   The replay attack may not be as important for DNS, as DNS queries are
   generally idempotent.  However consideration should be given to
   possible side-channel attacks [8].

Internet-Draft       ADoT Operational Considerations         August 2019


3.5.  Operational Monitoring

   Many operators use external passive monitors in order to understand
   the health and performance of their infrastructure.  Infrastructure
   monitoring is also often done to retain a copy of traffic for
   forensic purposes - such as the BIND "packet of death" [9] scenario.
   These legacy monitoring systems may break with the use of TLS 1.3.
   Therefore alternatives may need to be deployed/developed in order to
   maintain effective operational performance and security monitoring
   functionality.

   A number of solutions have been suggested:

   o  TLS Security and Data Center Monitoring: Searching for a Path
      Forward [10]

   o  TLS 1.3: Will Your Network Monitoring Go Blind? [11]

3.6.  Architecture

   Operators often reconfigure their architectural designs to best
   deliver a new product offering or service.  Operators should consider
   the following design alternatives for the new ADoT service:

   o  Operators should consider segregating ADoT addresses from
      traditional DNS over UDP/TCP to enable better attack mitigation,
      better service monitoring, less service interference, and more
      stability.

   o  Operators should weigh the pros/cons of using a TLS proxy vs
      direct client-to-host connection.  In case of ADoT, the client is
      most likely a recursive resolver and the host is the authoritative
      host server.

3.7.  Socket efficiency/tuning considerations

   Operators can realize substantial gains in client session
   establishment and improve overall RTT by tuning sockets setting for
   best use-case efficiency.

   For the ADoT use case, operators should consult [RFC7766] section 6.2
   [12] and minimally consider the following:

   o  Optimal number of persistent connections - consideration should be
      given to the number of persistent connections maintained for both
      the recursive resolvers and authoritative servers

   o  Optimal read/write buffer size

Internet-Draft       ADoT Operational Considerations         August 2019


   o  Optimal session timeout

   o  Optimal close wait state time

   o  Optimal connection time/timeout

3.8.  Post-Quantum Security

   Given that ADoT deployments will likely have a long lifetime and are
   being introduced in an era where post-quantum security is now an
   important design consideration, it is prudent to consider how
   protections against quantum computers might be integrated into the
   deployments.

   [I-D.draft-hoffman-c2pq-05] outlines the threat quantum computing
   presents to classical cryptographic algorithms.

   External Pre-Shared Keys (EPSKs) may be less vulnerable to quantum
   attacks.  A proposed approach to combining EPSKs and certificates in
   TLS is described in
   [I-D.draft-housley-tls-tls13-cert-with-extern-psk-03].

4.  Suggestions for further research and development

4.1.  Required studies and analysis

   Unlike stub-to-recursive DNS communication, authoritative nameservers
   affect users in ways that end users cannot avoid or work around.  In
   the event that all authoritative servers for a zone are unreachable,
   the zone becomes globally unavailable.  Hence, in order to preserve
   stability and resiliency of authoritative nameservers when deploying
   ADoT, more empirical studies and analysis MUST be conducted.  The
   following list is a minimal set of studies and considerations that
   need to be conducted/addressed in order to maintain authoritative
   stability and resilience.

   o  Attack vectors and mitigation: consider the new adversarial powers
      enabled by ADoT - types of attacks and denial of service, or other
      security challenges that are created with the addition of ADoT to
      authoritative nameservers.

   o  Traffic: consider how traffic patterns to authoritative
      nameservers change with the introduction of ADoT and how these
      traffic patterns change when the parameters of the service are
      changed; e.g. persistent connection lifetime, TLS connection
      parameters, use of TLS session tickets [RFC5077] or Pre-Shared Key
      extension in TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] section 2.2 [13].  Consider how




Henderson, et al.       Expires February 14, 2020               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft       ADoT Operational Considerations         August 2019


      these traffic pattern changes will affect the architecture and
      infrastructure for authoritative operators.

   o  ADoT capacity and footprint expansion: consider how common scaling
      techniques impact authoritative operators; e.g. anycast, load
      balancing, custom hardware.

   o  DTLS/UDP - consider if there is any reason to implement DTLS given
      that we lose the benefit of pipelining requests and must drop back
      to TLS/TCP in the case of fragmentation.

   It is critical to conduct large-scale measurements of DNS
   infrastructure in order to quantify some of the scalability issues.
   While these tests may be performed initially in a controlled lab
   environment, the public Internet is fundamentally more variable.
   Therefore, global testing at scale on the Internet MUST also be
   conducted in order to understand and measure potential issues which
   must be overcome before full global deployment can occur.

4.2.  Authoritative DNS over TLS (ADoT) Profile

   Profiles can be used as a mechanism to help mitigate operational
   concerns over increased attack surface by restricting features such
   as computationally expensive processes, insecure ciphers, general
   starvation vectors, or other features that may limit operational
   performance.

   Therefore, an ADoT application profile draft, taking into account the
   conclusions of required studies and analysis, may help assuage some
   of the concerns raised in this document.

5.  Security Considerations

   In addition to the applicable security considerations described in
   RFCs [RFC7626] and [RFC8310], considerations focused on future
   deployment of quantum computers are described in Post-Quantum
   Security (Section 3.8).  Additional considerations associated with
   ADoT are TBD based on working group discussions.
