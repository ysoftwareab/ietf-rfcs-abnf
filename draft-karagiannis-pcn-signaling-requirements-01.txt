Abstract

   Precongestion notification (PCN) is a means for protecting quality of
   service for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv domain. The 
   overall PCN architecture is described in RFC 5559. This memo 
   describes the requirements for the signaling applied within the PCN 
   domain: PCN feedback is carried from the PCN-egress-node to the 
   decision point and the decision point may demand for the measurement 
   and delivery of the PCN rate sent at the PCN-ingress-node. The 
   decision point may be either collocated with the PCN-ingress-node or 
   a centralized node.

Internet-Draft       PCN Signaling requirements               March 2010


1.  Introduction
 

   The main objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to support 
   the quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv 
   domain in a simple, scalable, and robust fashion.  Two mechanisms 
   are used: admission control and flow termination. Admission control 
   is used to decide whether to admit or block a new flow request while 
   flow termination is used in abnormal circumstances to decide
   whether to terminate some of the existing flows.  To support these 
   two features, the overall rate of PCN-traffic is metered on every 
   link in the domain, and PCN-packets are appropriately marked when 
   certain configured rates are exceeded.  These configured rates are 
   below the rate of the link thus providing notification to boundary 
   nodes about overloads before any congestion occurs (hence "pre-
   congestion" notification). The PCN-egress-nodes measure the rates of 
   differently marked PCN traffic in periodic intervals and report these 
   rates as so-called PCN feedback to the decision points for admission 
   control and flow termination based on which they take their 
   decisions.The decision points may be collocated with the PCN-ingress-
   nodes or their function may be implemented in a centralized node.

   For more details see[RFC5559, [draft-ietf-pcn-cl-edge-behaviour-02], 
   [draft-ietf-pcn-sm-edge-behaviour-02].

   Thus, signaling is needed to transport PCN feedback from PCN-egress-
   nodes towards the decision point. Moreover, signaling is needed that 
   the decision point can trigger the PCN-ingress-node to measure the 
   PCN traffic rate and send these measurement results to the decision 
   point.

   This memo briefly describes the signaled content and specifies the 
   requirements that have to be satisfied by the signaling protocols. 


1.1.  Terminology

   In addition to the terms defined in [RFC5559], this document uses the
   following terms:
 
   Decision Point:

      The node that makes the decision about which flows to admit and to
      terminate.  In a given network deployment, this may be the ingress
      node or a centralized control node.  Of course, regardless of the
      location of the decision point, the ingress node is the point
      where the decisions are enforced.

Internet-Draft       PCN Signaling requirements               March 2010


   PCN egress feedback:

      Content used by the PCN-egress-node to report and inform the 
      decision point about measurements required during flow 
      admission and flow termination decisions.

   PCN ingress feedback:

      Content used by the PCN-ingress-node to report and inform the 
      decision point about measurements required during flow termination 
      decisions.

   ingress rate request:

      A message sent by the decision point towards the PCN-ingress-node 
      to request the PCN-ingress-node to measure and report the value of 
      the rate of admitted PCN traffic for a given 
      ingress-egress-aggregate.  


2.  Signaling requirements between PCN-egress-nodes and 
    Decision Point

   The PCN-egress-node measures the rates of differently marked PCN 
   traffic in regular intervals and signals them as PCN egress feedback 
   to the decision point.   
   This section describes the PCN egress feedback and the requirements 
   that apply to signaling protocols used for the transport of PCN 
   feedback from PCN-egress-nodes to decision points.
   Note that if the decision point and the PCN-ingress-node are 
   collocated, then the signaling requirements described in this section 
   apply to the signaling between PCN-egress-nodes and PCN-ingress-
   nodes. 


2.1 PCN Reporting Frequency

   The specification of PCN-based admission control and flow termination 
   in [draft-ietf-pcn-cl-edge-behaviour-02], [draft-ietf-pcn-sm-edge-
   behaviour-02] suggest measurement and reporting intervals at the PCN-
   egress-nodes of 100 to 500 ms.


2.2 Signaled PCN egress Feedback

   The PCN-egress-node measures per ingress-egress-aggregate the 
   following rates
      o rate of not-marked PCN traffic;
      o rate of threshold-marked PCN traffic, which applies to CL edge 
        behaviour only;
      o rate of excess-traffic-marked PCN traffic.

Internet-Draft       PCN Signaling requirements               March 2010


   These values are reported in octets/second to the decision point at 
   the end of each measurement interval.

   If multipath routing is enabled, the PCN-egress-node tracks a list of   
   flows for which it has recently received excess-traffic-marked 
   packets. The list of these flow IDs is included in the PCN feedback 
   because these flows are candidates for termination.
   The representation of a flow ID depends on the surrounding 
   environment, e.g., "pure IP", MPLS, GMPLS, etc. For the 
   representation of a flow ID in a "pure IP" surrounding environment,  
   see Section 2.4. 


2.3 Signaling requirements

   This section describes the requirements for signaling protocols that 
   are used to carry the PCN egress feedback from PCN-egress-nodes to 
   the decision point.


2.3.1 Priority of signaling messages

   Signaling messages SHOULD have a higher priority than data packets. 
   This is needed to avoid as much as possible the situations that 
   during severe overload cases the signaling messages are dropped 
   within the PCN domain.


2.3.2 Local information exchange

   Signaling messages MUST be able to carry the PCN egress feedback from 
   the PCN-egress-node to the decision point.


2.3.3 Carry identification of PCN edge nodes

   The signaling protocol MUST be able to carry identification 
   (address information) of the PCN edge nodes. 
   However, the identification of the PCN edge nodes 
   MUST NOT be visible outside the PCN domain.


2.3.4 Carry identification of ingress-egress-aggregates

   The signaling protocol MUST be able to carry identification 
   (address information) of the ingress-egress-aggregates. It is 
   proposed to identify them using the addresses of the PCN-ingress-node 
   and PCN-egress-node between which they pass. If each of the edge 
   nodes do not have unique addresses, then other identifiers could be 
   used.

Internet-Draft       PCN Signaling requirements               March 2010


2.3.5 Signaling load

   The load generated by the signaling protocol to carry the PCN egress 
   Feedback from the PCN-egress-nodes to the decision point SHOULD be 
   minimized as much as possible. 


2.3.6 Reliability

   There are situations that messages need to be sent in a 
   reliable way, meaning that the PCN-egress-node MUST be acknowledged 
   that the sent message is successfully received by the 
   decision point. It is considered that the PCN egress feedback that 
   is sent in a regular fashion SHOULD NOT be sent reliably.


2.4. Filter specifications

   In PCN the ingress and egress nodes should be able to identify the 
   ingress-egress-aggregate to which each flow belongs. Moreover, the
   egress node also needs to associate an aggregate with the address of
   the ingress node for receiving reports, if the ingress node is the
   decision point. The filter specification at the PCN-egress-nodes 
   depends on the surrounding environment, e.g., pure IP, MPLS, GMPLS. 
   In this document, only the pure IP filter spec is given as an 
   example. In this case the filter spec should be able to identify a 
   flow using (all or a subset of the) following information:

   o  source IP address;

   o  destination IP address;

   o  protocol identifier and higher layer (port) addressing;

   o  flow label (typical for IPv6);

   o  SPI field for IPsec encapsulated data; 

   o  DSCP/TOS field.

   o  IP address of PCN-ingress-node 

   o  IP address of PCN-egress-node 

   o  IP address of decision point

3. Signaling Requirements between Decision Point and PCN-ingress-nodes

   The decision point monitors and uses the PCN egress feedback sent by 
   the PCN-egress-node. There are situations that the decision point 
   must obtain an estimate of the rate at which PCN-traffic is being
   admitted to the aggregate from the PCN-ingress-node.  
   In order to receive this information the decision point has to 
   request from the PCN-ingress-node to send the value of the PCN 
   traffic admitted to a certain aggregate. 
   Note that if the decision point and the PCN-ingress-node are 
   collocated, then the signaling required between the decision point 
   and PCN-ingress-node are internal operations.


3.1 Signaled PCN ingress Feedback

   The PCN-ingress-node measures per ingress-egress-aggregate the 
   following rate 
      o rate of admitted PCN traffic 

   This value is reported in octets/second to the decision point as 
   soon as possible after receiving the request from the decision  
   point. .


3.2 Signaled decision point trigger

   The decision point uses the "ingress rate request" to request from 
   the PCN-ingress-node to send for a certain ingress-egress-aggregate, 
   the value of the admitted PCN traffic rate. The "ingress rate 
   request" message identifies the ingress-egress-aggregate for which 
   the admitted PCN traffic rate is required.


3.3 Signaling requirements

   The same signaling requirements described in Section 2.3 apply for   
   this situation. The only difference is the fact that these signaling 
   requirements apply for the signaling messages that have to be sent 
   between the decision point and PCN-ingress-nodes. Moreover, since the 
   "ingress rate request" message sent by the decision point towards 
   the PCN-ingress-node and the admitted PCN traffic rate sent by the 
   PCN-ingress-node towards the decision point are not sent regularly, 
   they SHOULD be delivered reliably.
