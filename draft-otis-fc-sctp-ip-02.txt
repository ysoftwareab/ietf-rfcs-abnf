       Abstract 
        
       This specification incorporates an encapsulation scheme for Fibre-
       Channel (FC) using SCTP.  The essential advantages for using SCTP 
       compared to TCP as it relates to FC are as follows: 
        - Headers contained within one frame. 
        - Objects aligned at 32-bit boundaries. 
        - Out of sequence frame processing. 
        - Standard authentication. 
        - Independent streams under common control. 
        - Session restart. 
        - Improved error detection. 
        - Prevention of blind spoofing and denial of service attacks. 
        - Standard Heartbeat and multi-homing.  (optional) 
        
       The principle focus of this document is to provide an implementation 
       of SCTP as an encapsulation with network related management required 
       for FC traffic.  As FC traffic is predominately related to storage, 
       functions in this area affect storage as well as a possible means of 
       direct IP access.  Stream filtering to block non-storage related 
       traffic is an example of a storage specific function covered.

       Definitions 
        
       Fibre-Channel (FC) Frames are encapsulated as Data Payload chunks 
       within the SCTP protocol.  See FC Frame Format for a definition of the 
       FC delimiter encoding.  The Payload Protocol Identifier is determined 
       by IANA.  All Payload Data types will be sent Unordered.  The Host 
       Name Address option shall not be supported to protect from DNS 
       attacks. 
        
       Stream Management 
        
       Stream 0 is reserved as a control stream that exchanges configuration 
       structures to assign FC port and attributes to streams within Data 
       Payload Chunks.  These structures are as follows: 
        
         0                   1                   2                   3

       Assign Stream: 
        
       This request is to obtain a stream connected to a B_Port.  The B_Port 
       is defined in FC-SW-2.  The B_Port supports the R_RDY flow control 
       with Buffer-to-Buffer Credit specified in its parameters.  This 
       request also provides an advisory priority desired.  It can also 
       assert a time limit for dropping stale frames.  The response will 
       return the request with the Management Response indicating acceptance 
       and if Good is returned, the B_Port/Stream field will be modified to 
       indicate the Stream assigned otherwise it will be set to zero.  The 
       server, to reflect any adjustments, may modify Priority and Time 
       Limit.  Should the Time Limit be zero, the Timestamp field is not 
       valid and no stale frames are dropped.  Future versions supporting 
       different encapsulations may redefine the B_Port/Stream field and add 
       additional fields to the Assign Stream Request.

       B_Port/Stream field is used to exchange the FC medium desired by the 
       client and the Stream this request will be granted.  The client may 
       request any number of FC medium connections at B_Ports. 
        
       The Priority field indicates the relative stream priority desired by 
       the client for the particular FC medium connection.  The lower value 
       receives less priority by the SCTP sender. 
        
       The Encapsulation field presently is defined as containing the value 
       zero.  In the future, this field may be used to indicate alternative 
       encapsulation techniques or structures. 
        
       Authentication Management 
        
       Authentication management is facilitated with SCSI-LDAP.  Agents 
       implementing FC/SCTP/IP are intended to use LDAP to obtain the 
       required information for establishing communications.  These 
       structures extend into stream management attributes in some cases. 
        
       Advisory 
        
       Devices implementing FC/SCTP/IP will also implement ARP, ICMP and 
       optionally DHCP-BOOTP, and SNMP. 
        
       Only FC Class 3, Class 2, and Class F are supported.  The B_Port will 
       only support Buffer-to-Buffer flow control.  As such, SOFi3, SOFn3, 
       EOFn, EOFt delimiters are predominately expected.  The Exchange Error 
       Policy is _Abort, discard multiple sequences._  To send SCSI commands, 
       the R_CTL field is set with 0x6 to indicate an unsolicited command, 
       0x1 to indicate solicited data.  R_CTL 0x5 indicates Data Descriptor, 
       and 0x7 indicates Response.  The TYPE field with 0x8 indicates SCSI-
       FCP.  The S_ID identify the initiator and D_ID the target.  The 
       initiator with the Originator Exchange ID, OX_ID, uniquely identifies 
       every exchange between the initiator and target with a value other 
       than 0xFFFF.  OX_ID is analogous to the Queue Tag but the number of 
       open sequences is limited by the SEQ_ID, which is assigned by the 
       sequence initiator to a unique number to identify the sequence.  
       SEQ_CNT uniquely identifies FC frames within a sequence and the first 
       frame always starts at 0.  A target may assign a RX_ID to an exchange 
       as an alias for S_ID and OX_ID but not used by the initiator. 
        
       The Frame Control field, F_CTL, contains state information: 
        - Bit 8  = From Responder 
        - Bit 9  = Recipient/Initiator Sequence Context 
        - Bit 10 = First Sequence 
        - Bit 11 = Last Sequence 
        - Bit 12 = Last Frame of Sequence 
        - Bit 13-14 = don't care 
        - Bit 15 = Transfer/Hold Sequence Initiative 
        - Bit 16-17 = don't care 
        - Bit 18-21 = reserved 
        - Bit 22-27 = don't care 
        - Bit 28 = Parameter equals Relative Offset (set by target) 
        - Bit 29 = reserved 
        - Bit 30-31 = Number of fill bytes.

       The DF_CTL specifies the presents of optional header and should be set 
       to 0.  The 4 byte CRC field does not include the SOF and EOF fields 
       and uses the polynomial: 
          x^32+x^26+x^23+x^22+x^16+x^12+x^11+x^10+x^8+x^7+x^5+x^4+x^2+x+1 
        
       FC Frame Format Encapsulation: 
        
       The exact size of each frame varies depending on the size of the 
       variable fields.  The size of the variable field ranges from 0 to 
       2112-bytes as shown in the FC Frame Format in Fig. 5 resulting in the 
       minimum size FC Frame of 36 bytes and the maximum size FC frame of 
       2148 bytes.  The FC Frame will be prefixed with 8 bytes of additional 
       information to assist the SCTP transport as a Data Payload chunk as 
       follows: 
        
         0                   1                   2                   3

       The Timestamp should be used to ensure overlapped recovery does not 
       create a cascade of traffic.  IP networks introduce latency delays 
       that warrant special considerations with respect to Fibre Channel 
       E_D_TOV (Node Life) and R_A_TOV (Fabric Life) values.  The total path 
       delay between a source and a destination FC B_Port should be less than 
       a maximum value of 3 seconds, to conform to normal Fibre Channel time 
       out values.  The timestamp applied at the initial reception however 
       only measures the differences due to queuing and packet retries at the 
       IP level, which will comprise the greatest component of this possible 
       delay.  The SCTP sender just prior to issue measures the time limit to 
       comply with timeouts.  The sender must monitor and control the send 
       queue depth to ensure minimal latency following the issuing of the FC 
       frame and monitor the network RTT.

       Ordered Set Sequences, OSS, are detected between FC frames and are 
       indicated within this field.  Should SOF and EOF have the value of 
       zero, the remainder of the frame is not valid and may be truncated.  
       Such a truncated field will not affect credit/debit accounting.
                                                                       
       The N bit indicates the CRC field is not valid and must be constructed 
       before passing to FC. 
        
       The C bit indicates the server asserts login credits.  The client, as 
       acknowledgement, returns this bit. 
        
       Tcredit indicates either return of a used credit or possibly 
       additional credits for active streams where additional buffers are 
       available.  Should the server set the C bit, this field indicates the 
       current debit while de-allocating any additional credits that have 
       been granted.  The client does not set Tcredit.  The credit is 
       established as Buffer-to-Buffer credits during login.  The SCTP server 
       agent may add additional credits via Tcredit. 
        
       The remaining portion of this chunk contains the FC Frame.  The Frame 
       Header is 24-bytes long and has several fields associated with the 
       identification and control of the payload.

       SOF and EOF Delimiters: 
        
       On a FC link, SOF and EOF are called Ordered Sets and are sent as 
       special out-of-band words constructed from the 10-bit comma character 
       (K28.5) followed by 3 additional 10-bit data characters.  On a non-
       Fibre Channel link the Start of Frame (SOF) and End of Frame (EOF) 
       delimiters are both byte-encoded and 4-bytes long. 
        
       On a FC link the SOF delimiter serves to identify the beginning of a 
       frame and prepares the receiver for frame reception.  The SOF contains 
       information about the frame's Class of Service, position within a 
       sequence, and in some cases, connection status. 
        
       The EOF delimiter identifies the end of the frame and the final frame 
       of a sequence.  In addition, it serves to force the running disparity 
       to negative.  The EOF is used to end the connection in connection-
       oriented classes of service. 
        
       It is therefore important to preserve the information conveyed by the 
       delimiters across the IP-based network, so that the receiving FC to IP 
       device can correctly construct the FC frame in its original SOF and 
       EOF format before forwarding it to its ultimate FC destination on the 
       FC link if acting as a bridge.

       Start of Frame (SOF) and End of Frame (EOF) byte encoding are defined 
       in Annex A.  The SOF and EOF codes are encoded as a single byte to 
       represent each FC Ordered Set. 
        
       Frame Header: 
        
       The Frame Header is 24-bytes long and has several fields that are 
       associated with the identification and control of the payload.  
       Current FC Standards allow up to 3 Optional Header fields: 
        - Network Header (16-bytes) 
        - Association Header (32-bytes) 
        - Device Header (up to 64-bytes) 
        
       Frame Payload: 
        
       The FC Frame Payload is transparent to the FC to IP device.  An FC 
       application level payload is called an Information Unit at the FC-4 
       Level.  This is mapped into the Frame Payload of the FC Frame.  A 
       large Information Unit is segmented using a structure consisting of FC 
       Sequences.  Typically, a Sequence consists of more than one FC frame.  
       FC to IP does not maintain any state information regarding the 
       relationship of frames within a FC Sequence. 
        
       CRC: 
        
       The CRC is 4-bytes long and uses the same 32-bit polynomial used in 
       FDDI and Ethernet and is specified in ANSI X3.139 Fiber Distributed 
       Data Interface.  When FC frames are encapsulated into IP packets, the 
       CRC is untouched. 
        
       APPENDIX A: Fibre Channel EOF and SOF Encoding 
        
       A.1 Ordered Sets 
        
       On a FC link, Ordered Sets (OS) are sent as special out-of-band words 
       constructed of the 10-bit comma character (K28.5) followed by 3 
       additional 10-bit data characters.  The Ordered Sets defined by FC 
       include the Frame Delimiter, Start of Frame (SOF) and End of Frame 
       (EOF), and other Primitive Signals. 
        
       When FC frames are encapsulated in an IP packet, the Byte-encoded 
       frame format is used.  The Byte-encoded frame format uses 32-bit OS 
       Code Words to represent valid FC frame delimiter.  This format uses a 
       single-byte OS Code to represent each FC Ordered Set. 
        
       For frame delimiters, the encoding is mapped using the encoding 
       defined in a proposal for a Fibre-Channel Backbone (FC-BB) located at: 
          ftp://ftp.t11.org/t11/pub/fc/bb/00-068v3.pdf 
        
       FC frame delimiters shall be encoded as shown in Table A.2.
