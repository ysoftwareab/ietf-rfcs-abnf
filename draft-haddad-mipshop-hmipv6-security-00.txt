Abstract

   This memo describes a method for establishing a security association
   between the mobile node and the selected mobility anchor point in an
   hierarchical mobile IPv6 domain.  The suggested solution is based on
   combining the cryptographically generated address (CGA) and crypto-
   based identifiers (CBID) technologies.

1.  Introduction

   The Hirarchical Mobile IPv6 Mobility Management [HMIPv6] did not
   specify nor favor any particular mechanism for establishing a
   Security Association (SA) between the Mobile Node (MN) and the
   Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) located within an HMIPv6 domain.

   This memo describes a method allowing to establish an SA between the
   MN and the selected MAP.  The suggested solution is based on
   combining the Cyptographically Generated Addresses [CGA] and Crypto-
   Based Identifiers [CBID].

3.  Glossary

   Access Router

   The Access Router is the Mobile Node's default router.  The AR
   aggregates the outband traffic of mobile nodes.

   Mobility Anchor Point (MAP)

   A Mobility Anchor Point is a router located in a network visited by
   the mobile node, which is used by the MN as a local Home Agent (HA).

   Regional Care-of Address (RCoA)

   A Regional Care-of Address is an address obtained by the MN from the
   visited network.  An RCoA is an address on the MAP's subnet and is
   auto-configured by the MN when receiving the MAP option.

   On-link Care-of Address (LCoA)

   The LCoA is the on-link CoA configured on a mobile node's interface
   based on the prefix advertised by its default router.

   Local Binding Update (LBU) Message

   The MN sends a Local Binding Update message to the MAP in order to
   establish a binding between the RCoA and the LCoA.

   Pre-Binding Update (PBU) Message

   The MN's default router sends a Pre-Binding Update message to the MAP
   upon receiving a valid CGA signature carried by the Route
   Sollicitation message sent by the MN.

   Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA)

   A technique [CGA] whereby an IPv6 address of a node is
   cryptographically generated by using a one-way hash function from the
   node's public key and some other parameters.

   Crypto-Based Identifier (CBID)

   A technique [CBID] whereby a non-routable identifier is
   cryptographically generated by using a one-way hash function from the
   node's public key and an imprint.

   Binding Acknowledgment (BA) Message

   The MAP sends a binding acknowledgment message to the MN in response
   to an LBU message.

4.  Proposed Solution

   We assume that the MN's LCoA is always computed based on the CGA
   technology, in order to allow the MN to run the secure neighbor
   discovery procedure described in [SEND].  Such assumption has also
   been made to provide a security mechanism for the [FMIPv6].  Based on
   that, the first MN's LCoA will always be a CGA address.

   In addition, we assume that the MN can discover the presence of an
   HMIPv6 domain before sending a RtSol message.  One way to implement
   such discovery mechanism is described in the [FRD] proposal.  In the
   following, we suppose that the FRD technology is implemented in all
   Access Points (APs) (note that the solution is also applicable in
   other scenarios).

   The suggested solution introduces a new signaling message, i.e., Pre-
   Binding Update (PBU) message, which is sent by the AR to the MAP, and
   on using the Crypto-based ID (CBID) to provide the MAP with
   sufficient proof of ownership of the suggested RCoA.  The PBU message
   is sent by the AR to the MAP upon receiving a valid RtSol message
   from the MN and signed with its CGA public key.  Finally, the
   suggested solution is also applicable to the optimized micro-mobility
   management proposal described in [OMM].

   The suggested solution is described in the following steps:

   o  When the MN discovers that it has entered an HMIPv6 domain, it
      computes an LCoA address by using its CGA key pair and a CBID by
      hashing the CGA public key together with a 64-bit imprint.

   o  The MN inserts the CBID in the RtSol message, then signs the
      message as described in SEND and sends it to the AR.

   o  Upon receiving a valid RtSol message carrying a CBID, the AR
      replies immediately by sending a unicast RtAdv message to the MN
      and in parallel, a PBT message to the MAP.  For this purpose, the
      AR MUST compute a secret (Ks), encrypts it with the MN's CGA
      public key and sends it in the RtAdv message.  The AR MUST send Ks
      to the MAP in the PBT message, in addition to the MN's CGA public
      key, its LCoA and CBID.  Note that it is assumed that the PBT
      messages are signed by the ARs.

   o  After receiving the PBT, the MAP creates a BCE for the MN, which
      will contain all parameters sent by the AR.  Once the BCE is
      created, the MAP will wait for the owner of the LCoA to send the
      LBU message.

Internet-Draft                  HMIPv6sec                   October 2005


   o  When the MN gets a valid RtAdv message, it sends an LBU message to
      request the MAP to bind its LCoA to its new RCoA.  However, the MN
      will configure its RCoA by using as interface identifier (iid),
      the 64 bits, which have been used as imprint to generate the CBID.

   o  Upon receiving an LBU message, the MAP searches its BCEs table for
      an LCoA, which matches the one sent in the LBU message.  If the
      same LCoA is found, then the MAP hashes the RCoA iid with the
      stored CGA public key and compares it to the CBID.  If, the two
      hash values are the same, then the MAP generates a long term
      shared secret, Km, encrypts it with Ks and inserts it in the BA
      message.

   o  In addition, the MAP MUST insert in the BA message the result
      obtained from hashing Ks (i.e., hash(Ks) = HKs).  However, if the
      two hash values are not equal then the MAP simply discards the LBU
      message.

   o  When the MN gets a BA message, it searches first if it carries the
      HKs.  If HKs is correct, then the MN decrypts the shared secret
      and establishes a bidirectional security association (SA) with the
      MAP.

   o  Finally, both nodes MUST use Ks to authenticate all subsequent
      LBU/BA messages exchanged between them.

   Note that the SA lifetime is set to 24 hours, after which the MN has
   to request the MAP to renew it.

7.  Security Considerations

   This proposal suggests using the CBID and CGA technologies in order
   to avoid increasing the number of messages that need to be signed
   with an RSA key beyond the SEND procedure.  This is recommended due
   to the fact that public key signature is a computationally expensive
   and lengthy procedure.

   The suggested proposal does not create nor enhance any new and/or
   existing threats.  In particular, launching a man-in the middle
   attack against the MN is not possible because the attacker is not
   aware of the shared secret.  In addition, launching a denial of
   service attack against the MAP or the MN is not easy due to the fact
   that both nodes can scan incoming messages for a partial authenticity
   before validating the authenticity and decrypting the shared secret.
