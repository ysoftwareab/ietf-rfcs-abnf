Abstract

   This document describes fault detection and localization mechanism
   for MPLS TP ring network using dedicated control node and
   bidirectional periodical status OAM message. The mechanism takes
   advantage of ring topology and greatly reduces OAM sessions and
   messages among nodes in the ring.

1. Introduction

   MPLS-TP is joint effort of IETF and ITU to standardize MPLS as a
   transport technology.

   Ring is a common network topology and has its own characteristics.

   It is stated in [MPLS-TP Reqs] that there are interests among service
   providers to optimize OAM and other mechanisms for ring based
   topology.

   Ring is different from line in that it is closed, which means message
   sent by one node will go through other nodes and return back to the
   originating node.

   Another difference is that node can send information to other nodes
   via either of the 2 directions in the ring.

   We can take advantage of these features of ring to design different
   optimized solutions for failure detection, localization and
   protection.

   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].



3. Analysis of related documents

   There are several works on ring based MSPL-TP protection mechanisms.

   1) Multiprotocol Label Switching Transport Profile Ring Protection
   Analysis [draft-yang-mpls-tp-ring-protection-analysis]:

   This is analysis of 3 possible solutions discussed in IETF and ITU
   Joint Work Team (JWT) for MPLS-TP, namely Facility Bypass (1:N backup
   using label stack-outer label is for protection LSP and inner label
   is to distinguish which of the N protected LSP are inside the
   protection LSP), Detour (1:1 backup) and ITU-T G.8132.

   The first 2 methods are specified in [RFC 4090] (RSVP-TE FRR).

   ITU G.8132 itself also has 2 mechanisms, wrapping and steering.
   Wrapping is a local repair method similar to MPLS 1:1 backup but need
   switchover synchronization between nodes adjacent to failure.
   Steering is 1:1 head end protection mechanism that source and sink
   (destination) node switch to backup path after they learn failure via
   APS notification message sent out by node near the failure.



   2) MPLS-TP Ring Protection [draft-weingarten-mpls-tp-ring-protection]:

   This is analysis of 2 protection ring mechanisms for MPLS-TP, namely
   wrapping and steering.

   Wrapping is local protection mechanism quite similar to MPLS Detour
   FRR, and its PLR (point of local repair) and MP (merge point) are the
   2 nodes adjacent to the failure.

   Steering is similar to linear 1:1 protection in that it needs the
   coordination between ingress node and egress node. Ring Steering is
   different from generic linear protection in that the former uses OAM
   between any of the 2 nodes in the ring (full mesh) while the latter
   uses OAM per LSP. The full mesh is considered to be acceptable for
   ring with 16 nodes (16*16/2=128 sessions) or less and as an

   optimization as compared to per LSP OAM when LSP number is greater
   than 128.



   3) Protection for P2MP Ring in MPLS-TP Networks [draft-dai-mpls-tp-
   p2mp-ring-protection]:

   This document proposes 2 similar protection solutions for P2MP
   traffic in ring topology. The common part of the 2 solutions is that
   detection OAM message is sent by root and received by leaf in ring,
   after root node knows there is failure somewhere in the ring, it will
   send multicast traffic in both directions of the ring. And if leaf
   node can receive detection OAM message from root, it uses working
   path to receive traffic, otherwise, it uses backup path for traffic.

   The difference between the 2 solutions is that in one solution
   detection OAM message is blocked at the last leaf node and root
   cannot receive it, leaf node notifies root node the failure. While in
   the other solution, detection OAM message is circled back to root
   node, root node detects failure by itself if cannot receive the
   detection OAM message.



   4) P2MP traffic protection in MPLS-TP ring topology [draft-
   ceccarelli-mpls-tp-p2mp-ring]:

   This document proposes 2 ring protection solutions for P2MP traffic
     Unidirectional .

   One is to use local repair MPLS FRR specified in [RFC 4090].

   The other is called ROM (Ring Optimized Multicast) FRR. This solution
   uses upstream node close to failure to redirect traffic to backup LSP
   that is set up along the other direction of the ring. This solution
   will change the sequence of receiving nodes. Although it is targeted
   at multicast protection, it can also be used for unidirectional
   unicast LSP protection.

   Below is a summary of the above analysis:

   Existing solutions take advantage of ring for protection. We can also
   take advantage of ring for failure detection and localization.



4. Fault Detection and Localization Mechanism

4.1. Topology

   There are 2 unidirectional rings called inner ring and outer ring
   passing through each node in each ring, one is clockwise and the
   other is counter clockwise.

   There is a designated node that will send periodically fault
   detection OAM message in both rings, passing through each node in
   each ring and return to itself.

   If designated node receives detection OAM in each ring, it knows
   there is no fault. If it cannot receive the OAM in one ring, it knows
   there is fault in that ring.

   If there is not fault in ring, other nodes will receive detection OAM
   from designated node.

   If other nodes cannot receive detection OAM for some time in one of
   the or both rings, they know there is fault in corresponding
   direction, and will generate fault localization (alarm) OAM message,
   send it in both rings to designated node.

   Designated node will use these OAM to locate the fault and take
   actions. The actions taken will be discussed in other document.

   Definitions

   Bidirectional Localization (Alarm) OAM: OAM that indicates fault in
   both rings (S is 11 for 2 bits design or 1 for 1 bit design).

   Unidirectional Localization (Alarm) OAM: OAM that indicates fault in
   only 1 ring (S is 01 or 10 for 2 bits design or 0 for 1 bit design).

   Alarm node: Node from which designated node receives Alarm OAM.

   Non Alarm node: Node from which designated node does not receives
   Alarm OAM.

   Alarm ring: Ring in which designated node receives Alarm OAM.

   Counter Alarm ring: Ring other than Alarm ring. This is a relative
   concept based on Alarm ring. Designated node may or may not receive
   Alarm OAM in this ring.

   Alarm path: Path in Alarm ring from alarm node to designated node.

   Counter Alarm path: Path in Alarm ring from designated node to alarm
   node.

   Alarm parallel path: Path parallel to Alarm path in Counter Alarm
   ring from designated node to alarm node.

   Counter Alarm parallel path: Path parallel to Counter Alarm Path in
   Counter Alarm ring from alarm node to designated node.

   Fault ring: Ring in which designated node cannot receive detect OAM.

   Counter Fault ring: Ring other than Fault ring.

   Reach path: Path in Fault ring from designated node to non alarm node.

   Counter Reach path: Path in Fault ring from non alarm node to
   designated node.

   Reach parallel path: Path in Counter Fault ring from non alarm node
   to designated node.

   Counter Reach parallel path: Path in Counter Fault ring from
   designated node to non alarm node.



   Rule 1:

   If Localization (Alarm) OAM is bidirectional, which means designated
   node can receive Alarm OAM in both directions.

   Then

     In Alarm ring

     There is no fault in Alarm path

       Reason: Designated node can receive Alarm OAM in this path.

     And there is fault in Counter Alarm path

       Reason: Fault in both rings->fault in Alarm ring + No fault in

     In Counter Alarm ring

     There is fault in Alarm parallel path

     There is no fault in Alarm path and Counter Alarm ring

     And there is fault in Counter Alarm Path

   Inner ring 5>4 link is broken. (5>4 In)

   Node 1,2,3,4 can detect error in inner ring since they cannot receive
   detection OAM in that ring.

   Node 5, 6 will not detect error in inner ring since they can receive
   detection OAM in that ring.

   Node 2,3,4 will send via both rings unidirectional localization OAM
   to node 1.

   : In 6>5>4 X Out 3>4>5>6 X

   This case is different from previous one in that node 4 has a
   feedback path to node 1.

   Multiple nodes and links failure detection and localization is
   similar.

5. Security Considerations



6. IANA Considerations

   New GACH Channel Type for ring fault detection and localization OAM message is to
   be assigned by IANA.

7. Conclusions

   In this document, fault detection and localization mechanism for ring
   is discussed in details. It can detect and locate single link and
   node failure as well as multiple links and nodes failure. This
   mechanism is suitable for MPLS-TP ring protection requirement. After

   fault detection and localization, further actions like protection
   will be taken.
