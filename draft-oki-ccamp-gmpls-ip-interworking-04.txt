Internet-Draft    IP/MPLS - GMPLS interworking in support of IP/MPLS to GMPLS migration                                                      October 2004



   This document addresses the migration from Multiprotocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) to Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.  In order to
   expand the capacity of existing MPLS-based controlled infrastructure,
   networks consisting of L2SC, TDM, LSC, and FSC devices will be
   deployed, and these will be controlled by the GMPLS protocols.  GMPLS
   protocols are, however, subtly different from MPLS protocols.  This
   document describes possible migration scenarios, the mechanisms to
   compensate for the differences between MPLS and GMPLS protocols, and
   how the mechanisms are applied to migrate from a MPLS to a GMPLS
   network.

Internet-Draft    IP/MPLS - GMPLS interworking in support of IP/MPLS to GMPLS migration                                                      October 2004



1.  Introduction


   Multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) is widely deployed with
   applications such as traffic engineering and virtual private networks
   (VPN).  Various kinds of services such as VoIP, IPv6, L2VPN/L3VPN,
   and pseudo wire emulation are expected to be converged over the
   MPLS-based controlled infrastructure network.


   Many service providers report that traffic volume is increasing
   tremendously as broadband services enabled by ADSL and FTTH are
   rapidly penetrating the market, and the processing performance of
   terminal and server is ever increasing.  In order to cope with such
   an increase in the traffic volume, optical networks, which consist of
   TDM, LSC, and FSC devices, are being introduced.


   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) is being standardized by extending MPLS to
   control such optical networks (see [2], [3], [9], [10], [11], [12])
   in addition to Layer-2 Switching Capable (L2SC) and Packet Switching
   Capable (PSC) networks [6]).  GMPLS networks will be deployed as a
   part of the existing MPLS infractructure.  MPLS and GMPLS devices
   will coexist in the network until the existing MPLS network is
   completely migrated to the GMPLS network.


   GMPLS protocols are, however, subtly extending the capablities of the
   MPLS protocols.  In order to migrate from the existing MPLS to the
   GMPLS network, we need to define mechanisms to compensate the
   difference between MPLS and GMPLS.  In this document we discuss the
   migration scenarios from MPLS to GMPLS networks, the mechanisms to
   compensate for the differences between MPLS and GMPLS, and the
   applicability of the mechanisms to the possible migration scenarios.


   Note that GMPLS covers Packet Switching Capable (PSC) networks [6].
   In the rest of this document, the term GMPLS includes both PSC and
   non-PSC.  Otherwise the term "PSC GMPLS" or "non-PSC GMPLS" is
   explicitly used.


   GMPLS introduces new features such as bi-directional LSPs, label
   suggestion, label restriction, graceful restart, graceful teardown,
   and forwarding adjacencies (see [6] ).  Also, GMPLS provides several
   features in a distinct manner from MPLS.  For instance local
   protection is provided using distinct mechanisms in MPLS (see [17]) )
   and GMPLS (see [18] ).  Migration from MPLS to GMPLS should bring
   these features and such distinct mechanisms into the existing
   MPLS-based controlled infrastructure network.


   The rest of this document is organized as follows.  Section 2
   outlines the migration scenarios from MPLS to GMPLS networks.
   Section 3 describes the problems caused by the differences between

   MPLS and GMPLS protocols.  Section 4 presents the required mechanisms
   which bridge the differences between MPLS and GMPLS protocols.  Some
   of those mechanisms are available today and others are not.


2.  Migration scenarios


   Three categories of migration scenarios are considered: (1)
   MPLS-GMPLS-MPLS, (2) GMPLS-MPLS-GMPLS and (3) MPLS-GMPLS.  In the
   case of the MPLS-GMPLS-MPLS scenario, source and destination nodes of
   the Label Switched Path (LSP) are in MPLS networks, and a set of the
   LSP's transit nodes are in a GMPLS network.  In the case of the
   GMPLS-MPLS-GMPLS scenario, the LSP source and destination nodes are
   in a GMPLS network, and a set of the LSP's transit nodes are in an
   MPLS network.  Each category is subdivided in two sub-categories as
   to whether GMPLS is PSC or non-PSC except the category (3).  Finally
   in the case of the MPLS-GMPLS migration scenario, LSP starts/ends in
   an MPLS network and ends/starts in a GMPLS PSC network.


2.1  MPLS-GMPLS(non-PSC)-MPLS


   The introduction of a GMPLS-based controlled optical core network to
   increase the capacity is an example of this scenario.  TDM, LSC,
   and/or FSC LSPs are established between MPLS networks across the
   GMPLS network.  A set of those LSPs provide virtual network topology
   to connect the MPLS networks.  This topology may be reconfigurable by
   adding and/or removing those LSPs [15][16] MPLS LSRs and subnetworks
   interconnected at the edges of the virtual network topology may form
   a single MPLS network.


   Figure 1 shows the reference network model for the
   MPLS-GMPLS(non-PSC)-MPLS migration.  The model consists of three
   regions: ingress, transit, and egress.  Both the ingress and egress
   regions are MPLS-based while the transit region is GMPLS-based.  The
   nodes at the boundary of the MPLS and GMPLS regions (G1, G2, G5, and
   G6) are referred to as "border nodes".  All nodes except the border
   nodes in the GMPLS-based transit region (G3 and G4) are non-PSC
   devices, i.e., optical equipment (TDM, LSC, and FSC).  An MPLS LSP
   can be provisioned from a node in the ingress MPLS-based region (say,
   R2) to a node in the egress MPLS-based region (say, R4).  The LSP is
   referred to as the end-to-end (e2e) LSP.  The switching capability of
   both end points of the e2e LSP are the same (PSC).

2.2  MPLS-GMPLS(PSC)-MPLS


   An MPLS-based network can be migrated to GMPLS (PSC)-based network.
   The rationale of this type of migration scenario is supported by two
   factors:
   1.  to provide GMPLS-based advanced features in the network
   2.  to facilitate stepwise migration from MPLS to a GMPLS-based
       optical core network.
   Numerous advanced features are being developed in GMPLS and MPLS, but
   many are only currently available in a GMPLS context, such as
   bi-directional LSPs, label control, graceful restart, graceful
   teardown, and forwarding adjacencies.  An existing MPLS-based network
   could be migrated to become a GMPLS (PSC)-based network to deliver
   the advanced features.  Once the PSC network has been migrated to use
   GMPLS, it could be migrated to be or work with a GMPLS-based optical
   core network with less effort.


2.3  GMPLS(non-PSC)-MPLS-GMPLS(non-PSC)


   In this scenario, TDM or L2SC e2e LSPs are provisioned in the GMPLS
   network, which is disconnected.  Since the MPLS-based controlled
   infrastructure network is widely deployed, it is used to bridge the
   disconnected GMPLS network.  Pseudo wire emulation is used
   edge-to-edge in the MPLS-based converged network to carry those LSPs
   [13].


   Figure 2 shows the reference network model for the
   GMPLS(non-PSC)-MPLS-GMPLS(non-PSC) migration.  Both the ingress and
   egress regions are GMPLS-based while the transit region is
   MPLS-based.  All nodes in the GMPLS-based regions except the border

   nodes (G1, G11, G2, G21, G71, G7, G81, and G8) are non-PSC devices.
   An e2e GMPLS LSP can be provisioned from a node in the ingress
   GMPLS-based region (say, G2) to a node in the egress GMPLS-based
   region (say, G8).  The switching capability of both end points of e2e
   LSP must be the same.

2.4  GMPLS(PSC)-MPLS-GMPLS(PSC)


   In this scenario, GMPLS PSC e2e LSPs are provisioned in the GMPLS
   network, which is disconnected.  The MPLS-based controleed
   infrastructure is used to bridge the disconnected GMPLS network.
   Since the MPLS-based controlled network is PSC, the GMPLS PSC LSP can
   cross MPLS-based converged network without extra treatment in data
   plane.


2.5  GMPLS(PSC)-MPLS and MPLS-GMPLS(PSC)


   In this scenario a LSP starts/ends in the GMPLS (PSC) network and
   ends/starts in the MPLS network.  Some signaling conversion is
   required on border LSRs.  Since both networks are PSC there is no
   data plane conversion at network boundaries.


   Figure 3 shows the reference model for this migration scenario.
   Head-End and Tail-end LSR are in distinct control plane regions."

3.  Difference between MPLS and GMPLS protocols


3.1  Routing


   TE-link information is advertised by the IGP using TE extensions.
   This allows LSRs to collect topology information for the whole
   network and to store it in the traffic-engineering data base (TEDB).
   Best-effort routes and/or traffic-engineered explicit routes are
   calculated using the TEDB.


   GMPLS extends the TE information advertised by the IGPs to include
   non-PSC information.  The GMPLS extensions also apply to PSC
   networks.  The GMPLS extensions may be carried transparently across
   MPLS networks and may be used to compute a traffic-engineered
   explicit route across a mixed network, however, it is likely that a
   path computation component in an MPLS network will only be aware of
   MPLS TE information.  This may mean that it is impossible to compute
   a correct e2e LSP from one MPLS domain to another acorss a GMPLS
   domain.


   Figure 4 illustrates this problem.  Suppose that an e2e LSP is
   provisioned between R2 and R4 and that we need to compute the path
   between R2 and R4.  The TE link information for the links R2-R21,
   R21-G2, G6-R41 and R41-R4 is MPLS-based, while the information for
   the links G2-G4, G2-G3, G3-G4 and G4-G6 is GMPLS-based.  The node in
   the MPLS-based ingress region (say, R2) may compute a path using the
   TE link information that it is aware of, and may produce a path
   R2-R21-G2-G4-G6-R41-R4.  But it may be the case that the links G2-G4
   and G4-G6 cannot be connected because they have different switching

   capablities.  A path from G2 to G4 through G3 would, however, be
   successful.  If R2 was able to process the GMPLS TE information
   advertised by the IGP it would see the switching capability
   information and would select the correct path, but since it is an
   MPLS node it selects the wrong path based on the limited MPLS TE
   information.

  Figure 4: Problem mismatch of TE-link information in MPLS and GMPLS.


   MPLS and GMPLS use the same set of link state advertisements,   to
   communicate network link state information, but the GMPLS network
   uses several additional TLVs/sub-TLVs not defined for MPLS (see [4],
   [5], [10], [11]).


3.2  Signaling


   GMPLS RSVP-TE signalling ([2]) introduces new objects, and their
   associated procedures, that can not be processed/inserted by MPLS
   LSRs:
   o  The (Generalized) Label Request object (new C-Type), used to
      identify the LSP encoding type, the switching type and the
      generalized protocol ID (G-PID) associated with the LSP.
   o  The IF_ID RSVP_HOP objects, IF_ID ERROR_SPEC objects, and IF_ID
      ERO/RRO subobjects that handle the Control plane/Data plane
      separation in GMPLS network.
   o  The Suggested Label Object, used to reduce LSP setup delays.
   o  The Label Set Object, used to restrict label allocation to a set
      of labels, (particularly useful for wavelength conversion
      incapable nodes)
   o  The Upstream Label Object, used for bi-directional LSP setup (see
      also Section 3.4)
   o  The Restart Cap object, used for graceful restart.

   o  The Admin Status object, used for LSP administration, and
      particularly for graceful LSP teardown.
   o  The Recovery Label object used for Graceful Restart
   o  The ADMIN-STATUS objedct used for administation and graceful
      deletion
   Also GMPLS introduces a new message, the Notify message, that is not
   supported by MPLS nodes."


3.3  Control plane/data plane separation


   TDM, LSC, FSC networks do not recognize packet delineation.  In
   GMPLS, the control channel can be logically (in-band) or physically
   (out-of- band) separated from the data channel in those networks.
   The control channels between adjacent nodes constitute a control
   plane network.  Control packets of routing and signaling protocols
   are transmitted over the control plane network.


   If the GMPLS network consists of only PSC devices, there can be no
   control plane/data plane separation.  If the GMPLS network consists
   of PSC and non-PSC devices, there is at least a logical C/D
   separation between non-PSC devices, and between PSC and non-PSC
   devices.


   The GMPLS control plane, which is designed to carry the control
   packet in GMPLS network, is not likely to have enough capacity to
   carry the user-data traffic from MPLS network.  Therefore, the
   control plane must ensure is it not carrying data traffic from the
   MPLS network (see [9]).


3.4  Bi-directional LSPs


   GMPLS provides bi-directional LSP setup - a single signaling session
   manages the bi-directional LSP, and forward and reverse paths follow
   the same route in the GMPLS network.  There is no equivalent in MPLS
   networks, forward and backward LSPs must be created in different
   signaling sessions - the route taken by those LSPs may be different
   from each other, and their sessions are treated differently from each
   other.  Common routes and fate sharing require additional,
   higher-level coordination in MPLS.


   If MPLS and GMPLS networks are inter-connected, bi-directional LSPs
   from GMPLS network need to be carried in MPLS network.


4.  Required mechanisms


   This section details the set of routing and signalling mechanisms
   required in order to bridge the difference between MPLS and GMPLS
   protocols.

   The entire network consisting of ingress, transit, and egress regions
   (See Figure 1 or Figure 2 for instance) may be managed either as a
   single area or as multiple areas from the IGP perspective.  A simple
   migration approach can also consist of separating MPLS and GMPLS
   networks into distinct IGP areas (possibly in distinct ASs), and then
   relying on multi-area (multi-AS) routing, path computation, and
   signaling solutions worked on in the CCAMP WG.


   Note: This section only proposes mechanisms for MPLS-GMPLS-MPLS
   migration scenario.  GMPLS-MPLS-GMPLS and MPLS-GMPLS migration
   scenarios requirements will be addressed in a future revision of this
   document


4.1  Routing


4.1.1  TE link


   If the entire network is a single area, the partial topology of
   GMPLS-based region which consists of PSC-links should be made visible
   to the MPLS regions.  GMPLS TE-links are advertised into the MPLS
   regions as MPLS TE-links using MPLS-based TE link information.  This
   requires some TE-link information conversion at the border nodes.


   If the GMPLS-based region contains non-PSC links or devices (for
   example, if the whole region is non-PSC with the exception of the
   edge devices) PSC links should be set up between the PSC capable
   devices (for example, the border nodes).  For example, in Figure 3, a
   PSC-link can be set up between G2 and G6.


   MPLS TE-links may be understood by the nodes in the GMPLS network,
   which can transform MPLS-based TE-link information into GMPLS-based
   TE-link information.  This transformation can be performed by the
   border nodes or left to the individual GMPLS nodes.


   There is no backward compatibility issue when MPLS and GMPLS LSRs
   resides in distinct IGP areas, as TE-link information is not leaked
   across area boundary (see see [24] and [21]).


4.1.2  Forwarding adjacencies


   FAs may be established within or across the GMPLS region.  The FAs
   may be full FAs [19] or virtual FAs (see Section 4.1.2.2) and are
   advertised into the MPLS regions, by the routing protocol using MPLS
   TE-link information ( [10] and [11]).


4.1.2.1  Provisioned FAs


   PSC links may be advertised as forwarding adjacencies (FAs) in the




Brungard, et al.         Expires April 25, 2005                [Page 10]
Internet-Draft    IP/MPLS - GMPLS interworking in support of IP/MPLS to GMPLS migration                                                      October 2004



   GMPLS-based region and advertised in the MPLS regions as TE links
   using MPLS-based TE information.  Any FA that is established across
   the GMPLS region must be of type PSC so that is can be used by the
   MPLS PSC network.  If the GMPLS network is not PSC, the border nodes
   are responsible for the appropriate adaptation.


   An e2e MPLS LSP may be tunnelled through one or more FAs across the
   GMPLS-based transit region.  Multiple e2e MPLS LSPs may be tunnelled
   through a single FA [19].  Statistical multiplexing can be used to
   carry multiple e2e MPLS LSPs through a single FA-LSP thus making full
   use of bandwidth in the GMPLS region.


   Traffic engineering can be achieved within the GMPLS region by
   repositioning the FA-LSPs without impacting the e2e MPLS LSPs.
   Traffic engineering within the MPLS regions is performed by
   repositioning the e2e MPLS LSPs and possibly utilizing different
   FA-LSPs.


   A full mesh of FAs may be created between every border node.  The
   merit of a full mesh of PSC FAs is that it provides stability to the
   MPLS-level routing.  That is, the forwarding table of an MPLS LSR is
   not impacted by re-routing changes within the GMPLS region.  Further,
   there is always full MPLS reachability and immediate access to
   bandwidth to support MPLS LSPs.  However, the full mesh approach
   means that bandwidth is always pre-allocated within the GMPLS region.
   This might lead to congestion in the core of the region depending on
   the topology and number of border nodes.  If the traffic demand does
   not necessitate a full mesh of FAs, the congestion could be avoided.


4.1.2.2  Virtual FAs


   If PSC FAs are used to enable MPLS PSC connectivity over part or all
   of a non-PSC GMPLS region it may be considered disadvantageous to
   pre-provision the FA-LSPs since this may reserve bandwidth within the
   GMPLS network that could be used for other LSPs in the absence of
   MPLS packet-based traffic.


   However, in order that the MPLS regions can route traffic across the
   GMPLS region, the FAs must still be advertised into the MPLS regions
   as TE links.  Such TE links that represent the possibility of an FA
   are termed "virtual FAs".


   If an MPLS LSP is set up that makes use of a virtual FA, the
   underlying FA-LSP is immediately instantiated.  The virtual FA-LSP
   may be initially pre-provisioned using techniques described in [8]
   for secondary LSPs in shared mesh restoration.


   A set of virtual FAs combined with a PSC links and pre-established




Brungard, et al.         Expires April 25, 2005                [Page 11]
Internet-Draft    IP/MPLS - GMPLS interworking in support of IP/MPLS to GMPLS migration                                                      October 2004



   FAs forms the virtual topology for best-effort and/or
   traffic-engineered routes across the GMPLS region.  The virtual
   topology may be designed taking into account the (forecast) traffic
   demand and the available resources in the GMPLS transit region.  The
   virtual topology may change dynamically according to variations in
   the (forecast) traffic demand and the available resources to optimize
   the tradeoff between network performance and the residual network
   capacity.  The virtual topology can be changed by setting up and/or
   tearing down virtual FA-LSP as well as by changes to real links and
   to real FAs.  How to design the virtual topology and its changes is
   out of scope of this document.


   If virtual FAs are used in place of FAs, the TE links across the
   GMPLS-based transit region can remain stable using pre-computed paths
   while wastage of bandwidth within the GMPLS region, and unnecessary
   reservation of adaptation ports at the border nodes is avoided.  Some
   consideration might be given to assigning higher costs to the TE
   links for virtual FAs when the underlying FA-LSP has not been
   established.  This ensures that traffic is placed on existing FA-LSPs
   before new FA-LSPs are established.


   Note that, as for FAs, a virtual FA do not give rise to a routing
   adjacency.  Further, until the supporting FA-LSP is established there
   can be no exchange of routing or signaling (e.g.  RSVP Hello)
   messages between the end points of the virtual FA.


4.1.2.3  FA Utilization


   There are several possible schemes for determining how many FAs to
   provision, when to enable the FAs, and whether to choose FAs of
   virtual FAs, leading to specific mechanisms required for
   transitioning:
   1.  If there is low traffic demand, some FAs, which do not carry any
       e2e MPLS LSPs may be released so that resources in the GMPLS
       region are released.  Alternatively, the FAs may be retained for
       future usage.  Release or retention of under utilized FAs is a
       policy decision.  Additional FAs may also be created based on
       policy, which might consider residual resources in the
       GMPLS-based transit region and the change of traffic demand
       across the region.  By creating the new FAs, the network
       performance such as maximum residual capacity may be improved.
   2.  As the number of FAs grows, the residual resource in the
       GMPLS-based transit region may decrease.  In this case,
       re-optimization may be invoked in the GMPLS-based transit region
       according the the policy.  As part of the reoptimization process,
       FA-LSPs may be rerouted while keeping interface identifiers of FA
       links unchanged.  The routing at the MPLS level is unaffected
       since there is no change to the topology of TE links composed of




Brungard, et al.         Expires April 25, 2005                [Page 12]
Internet-Draft    IP/MPLS - GMPLS interworking in support of IP/MPLS to GMPLS migration                                                      October 2004



       FAs across the GMPLS-based transit region.
   3.  When residual resource in the GMPLS-based transit region
       decreases to a certain level, some FAs may be released according
       to policy.  Ideally, only FAs that are not carrying e2e MPLS LSPs
       would be released, but in some cases it may be necessary to
       release FAs that are carrying traffic.  The FA should be released
       only after the LSA associated with the FA has been withdrawn
       throughout the entire (MPLS and GMPLS) network.  Once the LSA has
       been withdrawn, any e2e MPLS LSPs routed over the FA will be
       rerouted to use other FAs (by using other border nodes).  The
       effect of this process on e2e MPLS LSPs that use the FAs that are
       being withdrawn can be reduced by using the graceful link
       withdrawal procedures described in [22].


4.1.3  Segment Stitching


   There is a direct, one to one relationship between the e2e MPLS LSP
   and the stitched segment LSP that carries it across the transit
   region.  In the control plane it is clear that there are two LSPs,
   but in the data plane, the stitching process means that there is
   actually a single end-to-end label switched path.


   If the transit region is PSC, the composite LSP is a simple PSC path
   from ingress to egress.  But stitching is also applicable with
   non-PSC transit domains if appropriate adaptation function is
   available to map (or encapsulate) the packets to the appropriate
   signal.


4.1.3.1  Stitchable Segments with associated FAs


   Stitchable transit segments may be managed as FAs or virtual FAs with
   the consequent advertisement into the MPLS regions as TE links.
   Note, however, that because of the one-to-one relationship between
   the stitched segment and the e2e LSP, the TE link must be advertised
   as fully utilised as soon as a single e2e LSP is carried regardless
   of the relative bandwidths.  Thus a stitching technique in a non-PSC
   GMPLS transit region may make inefficient use of resources.


   As an FA is in use, the ingress region will attempt to use
   make-before-break with resource sharing to modify the e2e LSP as
   required, and this may result in the e2e LSP being moved to a
   distinct FA TE link.


4.1.3.2  Stitchable Segments without associated FAs


   Stitching may also be used in the absence of FAs (or virtual FAs).
   This is particularly feasible when the network is partitioned into
   areas or ASs and the responsibility for routing the e2e MPLS LSP




Brungard, et al.         Expires April 25, 2005                [Page 13]
Internet-Draft    IP/MPLS - GMPLS interworking in support of IP/MPLS to GMPLS migration                                                      October 2004



   across the transit domain is delegated to the border node.  See [21]
   for more details of this applicability.


   As FAs are not used, the change in bandwidth requirement will be
   signaled as for the contiguous case with the expectation that the e2e
   MPLS LSP will be modified using resource sharing.  When this happens
   the control plane managing the stitched segment must also act to
   increase the reserved bandwidth.  This operation might not be
   necessary if cross-technology stitching (such as PSC to TDM) is in
   use.


4.2  Signaling


   Three basic cases for the MPLS-GMPLS-MPLS environment are described
   in Figure 4 : LSP nesting, LSP converting, and LSP stitching.
   1.  LSP nesting: One or more e2e MPLS packet LSPs is nested into one
       GMPLS LSP that may be PSC or non-PSC.
   2.  Contiguous LSP: The e2e MPLS packet LSP signaling messages ([7])
       are translated at the GMPLS region border into GMPLS RSVP-TE
       messages (see [3]), and are converted back again at the MPLS
       region border.  The GMPLS RSVP-TE segment MUST also be PSC.  This
       case requires a service interworking function mapping between [1]
       and [3] at the control plane level.
   3.  LSP stitching: An e2e packet LSP is constructed by stitching MPLS
       PSC LSP segments together with a transit GMPLS LSP.  The transit
       LSP would normally be PSC, but there is no reason to exclude
       non-PSC LSPs provided that the right adaptation is available in
       the data plane at the border nodes.  The stitching model requires
       identical function in the control plane to that used for nesting,
       but a strict one-to-one relationship between LSP segments must be
       maintained.

4.2.1  LSP nesting


   LSP nesting applies to the MPLS-GMPLS(non PSC)-MPLS and the
   MPLS-GMPLS(PSC)-MPLS migration scenarios.


   Figure 5 (a) illustrates LSP nesting in the MPLS-GMPLS-MPLS reference
   network.  An FA-LSP is created across the GMPLS region to carry one
   or more e2e MPLS PSC LSPs.  The FA-LSP is advertised as a TE link.


   Signaling messages are used to exchange the link identifiers for
   FAs/virtual FAs in a similar way to that described in [7] and [19]
   for FA-LSPs.  The LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object is forwarded
   transparently by transit LSRs to the FA tail-end (see [7]).

Internet-Draft    IP/MPLS - GMPLS interworking in support of IP/MPLS to GMPLS migration                                                      October 2004



   Activation of the virtual FA may use techniques similar to those
   described in [8]  for secondary LSPs in mesh recovery and is for
   further study.


   Both unnumbered and numbered link identifiers for FAs/virtual FAs
   should be supported.


4.2.2  Contiguous LSPs


   The contiguous LSP technique is only applicable when the GMPLS-based
   transit region is PSC i.e.  only applicable for the
   MPLS-GMPLS(PSC)-MPLS migration scenario.  Figure 5 (b) illustrates a
   contiguous LSP in the MPLS-GMPLS-MPLS reference network model.  The
   e2e LSP consists of three segments: ingress, transit, egress.  The
   transit segment is GMPLS-based and therefore it is referred to as
   GMPLS-segment while others are referred to as MPLS-segments.  The e2e
   MPLS LSP is associated with the single session, which is referred to
   as the "e2e" session.


   Contiguous LSPs rely on the availability of control plane conversion
   or mapping of the signaling messages as they cross the region
   boundaries and are, therefore, only available when a significant set
   of border nodes have this capability.  Specifically the entry and
   exit points to the GMPLS-based transit region used by an e2e MPLS LSP
   must be capable of converting the signaling messages.  If either node
   is not capable of this function, the LSP setup will fail.  Therefore,
   the node capabilities SHOULD be advertised by the border nodes give
   sufficient information to enable an operational path to be computed,
   or that suitable crankback mechanisms are used.  Another option is to
   make all border nodes capable of this conversion so that there are no
   issues.


   Contiguous LSPs may be modified according to traffic demand changes
   for the e2e LSP just as modifications may be made to a simple MPLS
   LSP.  That is, make-before-break with resource sharing may be used to
   increase or decrease the bandwidth of the whole LSP.


4.2.3  LSP stitching


   LSP stitching applies to the MPLS-GMPLS(non PSC)-MPLS and the
   MPLS-GMPLS(PSC)-MPLS migration scenarios.


   Figure 5 (c) illustrates LSP stitching in the MPLS-GMPLS-MPLS
   reference network.  A single e2e LSp is constructed in the data plane
   from one segment in each region - the segments are stitched together
   simply if all segments are packet-based, or through an adaptation
   function if the middle segment is not a PSC LSP.

Internet-Draft    IP/MPLS - GMPLS interworking in support of IP/MPLS to GMPLS migration                                                      October 2004



   In the control plane there are two sessions as there would be for LSP
   nesting.  However, only one e2e MPLS LSP can be carried by a single
   transit segment if stitching is used.  Note that the transit segment
   may be pre-established and advertised as an FA, advertised as a
   virtual FA and signaled on demand, or established on demand by the
   GMPLS region border node as the result of an MPLS LSP setup request.
   In the event of a change in traffic demand for the e2e LSP the
   behavior depends on whether FAs are being used: - If an FA is in use,
   the ingress region will attempt to use make-before-break with
   resource sharing to modify the e2e LSP as required, and this may
   result in the e2e LSP being moved to a distinct FA TE link.  - If FAs
   are not used, the change in bandwidth requirement will be signaled as
   for the contiguous case with the expectation that the e2e LSP will be
   modified using resource sharing.  When this happens the control plane
   managing the stitched segment must also act to increase the reserved
   bandwidth.  This operation might not be necessary if cross-technology
   stitching (such as PSC to TDM) is in use.


4.2.4  Discovery of GMPLS signalling capability


   It may be useful to advertise into the IGP the capability of a node
   to support GMPLS signalling.  This would allow every node in the
   network to automatically discover the GMPLS signalling regions.  [25]
   provides a functional description of routing extensions in order to
   advertise TE router information, including control plane capabilities
   such as GMPLS signaling.


   As there are several options for how the regions are managed from a
   routing perspective.  They could all be managed as a single area,
   they could be managed as separate areas, or they could be operated as
   separate ASs.  In the second and third cases, it may make sense to
   only advertise the border nodes that are capable of signaling
   conversion since it is impossible to set up e2e LSPs through other
   border nodes.  In the first case, however, the full topology is
   visible across the entire network and it is important that the
   specific conversion capabilities of the border nodes are advertised
   [25].  Note that in the case of contiguous LSPs, there is a
   one-to-one relationship between LSPs in the MPLS region and LSPs in
   the GMPLS region.
