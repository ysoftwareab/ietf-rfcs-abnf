<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> Introduction</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">The IAB, on behalf of the Internet technical community, is concerned with ensuring the continuity of the RFC Series, orderly RFC Editor succession, maintaining RFC quality, and RFC document accessibility. The IAB is also sensitive to the concerns of the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) about providing the necessary services in a cost effective and efficient manner.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">The definition of the RFC series is described in RFC 4844 <a href="#RFC4844">[RFC4844]</a>. Section 3.1 defines "RFC Editor": </p>
<div id="#rfc.figure.1"></div>
<pre>
     Originally, there was a single person acting as editor of the RFC
     Series (the RFC Editor). The task has grown, and the work now
     requires the organized activity of several experts, so there are
     RFC Editors, or an RFC Editor organization. In time, there may be
     multiple organizations working together to undertake the work
     required by the RFC Series. For simplicity's sake, and without
     attempting to predict how the role might be subdivided among them,
     this document refers to this collection of experts and 
     organizations as the "RFC Editor".

     The RFC Editor is an expert technical editor and series editor,
     acting to support the mission of the RFC Series. As such, the RFC
     Editor is the implementer handling the editorial management of the
     RFC Series, in accordance with the defined processes. In addition,
     the RFC Editor is expected to be the expert and prime mover in
     discussions about policies for editing, publishing, and archiving
     RFCs.

<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">RFC 4844 makes no attempt to explore the internal organization of the RFC Editor. However, RFC 4844 envisions changes in the RFC Editor organizational structure. In discussion with the Internet community, the IAB considered changes that increase flexibility and operational support options, provides for the orderly succession of the RFC Editor, and ensures the continuity of the RFC series, while maintaining RFC quality, maintaining timely processing, ensuring document accessibility, reducing costs, and increasing cost transparency. The model set forth below is the result of those discussions and the experience gained since, as described immediately below, and examines the internal organization of the RFC Editor, while remaining consistent with RFC 4844.  This version of the document also reflects the discussions, as described below, that have occurred since the first efforts to clarify that internal organization.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">Note that RFC 4844 uses the term "RFC Editor function" or "RFC Editor" as the collective set of responsibilities for which this memo provides a model for internal organization. This memo defines the term "RFC Series Editor" or "Series Editor" for one of the organizational components.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.6">The RFC Editor model was first approved in October 1, 2008 and has evolved since. During the implementation of version 1 of the model <a href="#RFC5620">[RFC5620]</a> it was quickly realized that the role of the RSE and the oversight responsibilities needed to be structured differently. In order to gain experience with 'running code' a transitional RFC Series Editor was hired who analyzed the managerial environment and provided recommendations. This version of the model is based on his recommendations and the subsequent discussion on the rfc-interest list.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.7">The document, and the resulting structures, will be modified as needed through normal procedures.  The RSE, and the IAB, through the RFC oversight committee (see <a href="#RSOC">Section 3.1</a>), will continue to monitor discussions within the community about potential adjustments to the RFC Editor model and recognizes that the process described in this document may need to be adjusted to align with any changes that result from such discussions, hence the version number in the title.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.8">The IAB and IAOC maintain their chartered responsibility as defined in <a href="#RFC2850">[RFC2850]</a> and <a href="#RFC4071">[RFC4071]</a>.  </p>

            Structure of RFC Series production and process.
</pre>
<p></p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.5">In this model documents are produced and approved through multiple document streams.  The stream manager for each stream is responsible for the content of that stream.  The four streams that now exist are described in [RFC4844].  The RFC Editor function is responsible for the packaging and distribution of the documents.  As such,  documents from these streams are edited and processed by the Production Center and published by the Publisher.  The RFC Series Editor will exercise executive management over the activities of the RFC Publisher and the RFC Production Center (which can be seen as back office functions) and will be the entity that: </p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Provides Executive Management for the overall operation of the RFC Editor, including the Production and Publication components.</li>
<li>Represents the RFC Series and the RFC Editor Function within the IETF and externally.</li>
<li>Is responsible for planning and seeing to the execution of improvements in the RFC Editor Production and Access Processes.</li>
<li>Leads the community in the development of improvements to the RFC Series.</li>
<li>Is responsible for the content of the rfc-editor.org web site, which is operated and maintained by the RFC Publisher.</li>
<li>The RSE will develop consensus versions of vision and policy documents which will be approved by the RFC Series Oversight Committee (<a href="#RSOC">Section 3.1</a>).</li>

The RSE performs annual reviews of the Production and Publication function which are then provided to the RSOC and the IASA.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.1.p.2">The RSE is responsible for the performance of the Production Center and Publisher.  The RSE is responsible for issues that go beyond the production or publication functions, such as cross-stream coordination of priorities.  Issues that require changes to the budget or contracts shall be brought to the IAD by the RSE.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.1.p.3">The RSE is also responsible for creating documentation and structures that will allow for the RFC Series' continuity in the face of changes in contracts and personnel. </p>

<p id="rfc.section.2.4.p.3">All these activities will be done under the general direction, but not day to day management,  of the RSE and need some level of coordination with various submission streams and the RSE. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.4.p.4">The RFC Publisher  contractor is to be selected through an IASA RFP process as described in <a href="#vendorsel">Section 4.1</a>.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.1">The IAB is responsible for oversight over the RFC Series and acts as a body for appeal and conflict resolution.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.2">In order to provide continuity over periods longer than the nomcom appointment cycle and assure that oversight is informed through subject matter experts the IAB will establish a group that implements oversight for the IAB, the RFC Series Oversight Committee (RSOC).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.3">The RSOC will act with authority delegated from the IAB: In general it will be the RSOC that will approve consensus policy and vision documents as developed by the RSE in collaboration with the community.  While it is expected that the IAB will exercise due diligence in its supervision of the RSOC,  the RSOC should be allowed the latitude to do its job without undue interference from the IAB.  Therefore, it is expected that the IAB will accord RSOC reports and recommendations the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.4">In those general cases the IAB is ultimately responsible for oversight and acts as a body for appeal and resolution.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.5">For all aspects that affect the RSE itself (e.g. hiring and firing) the RSOC prepares recommendations for the IAB but final decision is the responsibility of the IAB.  For instance the RSOC would: </p>

<ul>
<li>perform annual reviews of the RSE and reports to the IAB.</li>
<li>manage RSE candidate selection and advises the IAB on candidate appointment (in other words select the RSE, subject to IAB approval)</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.6">RSOC members are expected to recognize potential conflicts of interest and behave accordingly.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.7">RSOC will also work with the IASA, proposing a budget, and the remuneration and employment agreement of the RSE position.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.8">The RSOC will be responsible to ensure that the RFC Series is run in a transparent and accountable manner.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.9">The RSOC shall develop and publish its own rules of order.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.10">One of the first responsibilities of the RSOC will be to define in detail the solicitation and selection process for the next RSE.  The RSOC is expected to document to the community the process it selects.  Upon completion of the  selection, the RSOC should determine the best way to preserve this information for future use.  </p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.1.p.1">The RSOC will operate under the authority of the IAB, with the IAB retaining final responsibility.  The IAB will delegate authority and responsibility to the RSOC as appropriate and as RSOC and RSE relationships evolve.  The RSOC will include people who are not current IAB members.  Currently, this is aligned with the IAB Program structure.   The IAB will designate the membership of the RSOC with the goals of preserving effective stability, keeping it small enough to be effective, but large enough to provide general Internet Community expertise, specific IETF expertise, Publication expertise, and stream expertise.  Members serve at the pleasure of the IAB and are expected to bring a balance between short and long term perspective.  Specific input about, and recommendations of, members will be sought from the streams, the IASA, and the RSE.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.1.p.2">The IAOC will appoint an individual to serve as its Liaison to the RSOC.  The RSE and this Liaison will serve as non-voting ex-officio members of the RSOC.  Either or both can be excluded from its discussions if necessary.</p>

This board is known as the Independent Submission Stream Editorial Board.  This volunteer Editorial Board exists at the pleasure of the ISE, and the members serve at the pleasure of the ISE.

<p></p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.1">4.1.</a> <a href="#vendorsel" id="vendorsel">Vendor Selection</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.1">As stated earlier, vendor selection is done in cooperation with the streams and under the final authority of the IAOC.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.2">The RSE owns and develops the work definition (the SOW) and participates in the IASA Vendor selection process.  The work definition is created within the IASA budget and takes into account the stream managers and community input.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.3">The process to select and contract for an RFC Production Center, RFC Publisher, and other RFC-related services, is as follows: </p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>The IAOC establishes the contract process, including the steps necessary to issue an RFP when necessary, the timing, and the contracting procedures.  </li>
<li>The IAOC establishes the Selection Committee, which will consist of the RSE, the IAD, and other members selected by the RSOC and the IAOC.  The Committee shall be chaired by the RSE.</li>
<li>The Selection Committee selects the vendor, subject to the successful negotiation of a contract approved by the IAOC.  In the event that a contract cannot be reached, the matter shall be referred to the Selection Committee for further action.</li>
<li>The Selection Committee may select an RFC Publisher either through the IASA RFP process, or, at the Committee's option, the Committee may select the IETF Secretariat to provide RFC Publisher services, subject to negotiations in accordance with the IASA procedures. </li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.2">4.2.</a> Budget</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.1">The expenses discussed in this document are not new expenses.  They have been and remain part of the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA, <a href="#RFC4071">[RFC4071]</a>) budget.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.2">The RFC Series portion of the IASA Budget shall include entries for the RSOC, RSE, RFC Production Center, and the RFC Publisher.  The IASA Budget shall also include entries for the streams, including the independent stream.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.3">The IAOC has the responsibility to approve the total RFC Editor budget (and the authority to deny it.)  The RSE must work within the IAOC budgetary process.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.4">The RSE is responsible for managing the RFC Editor to operate within those budgets.  If product needs change, the RSE is responsible for working with the Production Center to determine what the correct response should be.  If they agree that a budgetary change is needed, that needs to be taken to the IAD and the IAOC.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.3">4.3.</a> <a href="#dispute" id="dispute">Disagreements Among RFC Editor Entities</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.1">If during the execution of their activities, a disagreement arises over an implementation decision made by one of the entities in the model, any relevant party should first request a review and reconsideration of the decision.  If that party still disagrees after the reconsideration, that party may ask the RSE to decide or, especially if the RSE is involved, that party may ask the IAB Chair (for a technical or procedural matter) to mediate or appoint a mediator to aid in the discussions, although not is obligated to do so.  All parties should work informally and in good faith to reach a mutually agreeable conclusion.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.2">If such a conclusion is not possible through those informal processes, then the matter must be registered with the RFC Series Oversight Committee. The RSOC may choose to offer advice to the RSE or more general advice to the parties involved and may ask the RSE to defer a decision until it formulates its advice. However, if a timely decision cannot be reached through discussion, mediation, and mutual agreement, the Series Editor is expected to make whatever decisions are needed to ensure the smooth functioning of the RFC Editor function; those decisions are final.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.3">RSE decisions of this type are limited to the functioning of the process and evaluation of whether current policies are appropriately implemented in the decision or need adjustment. In particular, it should be noted that final decisions about the technical content of individual documents are the exclusive responsibility of the stream approvers for those documents, as shown in the illustration in <a href="#model-figure">Figure 2</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.4">If informal agreements cannot be reached, then formal RSOC review and decision making may be required.  If so, the the RSE must identify the issues involved to the community, so that the community is aware of the situation.  The RSE will the report the issue to the RSOC for formal resolution by the RSOC with confirmation by the IAB in its oversight capacity.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.5">IAB and community discussion of any patterns of disputes are expected to inform future changes to Series policies including possible updates to this document.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.4">4.4.</a> Issues with Contractual Impact</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.p.1">If a disagreement or decision has immediate or future contractual consequences it falls under BCP 101 and IASA, and thus the Series Editor must identify the issue and provide his or her advice to the IAOC and, if the RSOC has provided advice, forward that advice as well. After the IAOC has notified the IAB, the IAD, as guided by the IAOC, has the responsibility to resolve these contractual issues under applicable procedures in BCP 101 and such appropriate contracts.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5">
<a href="#rfc.section.5">5.</a> IANA considerations</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.1">This document defines several functions within the overall RFC  Editor structure, and it places the responsibility for coordination of registry value assignments with the RFC Production Center. The IAOC will facilitate the establishment of the relationship between the RFC Production Center and IANA.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.2">This document does not create a new registry nor does it register any values in existing registries, and no IANA action is required.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.6">
<a href="#rfc.section.6">6.</a> Security considerations</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.1">The same security considerations as those in RFC 4844 apply. The processes for the publication of documents must prevent the introduction of unapproved changes. Since the RFC Editor maintains the index of publications, sufficient security must be in place to prevent these published documents from being changed by external parties. The archive of RFC documents, any source documents needed to recreate the RFC documents, and any associated original documents (such as lists of errata, tools, and, for some early items, non-machine readable originals) need to be secured against failure of the storage medium and other similar disasters.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.2">The IAOC should take these security considerations into account during the implementation and enforcement of the RFC Editor model contracts.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7">
<a href="#rfc.section.7">7.</a> Acknowledgments</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.1">The RFC Editor model was conceived and discussed in hallways and on mail lists. The first iteration of the text on which this document is based was first drafted by Leslie Daigle, Russ Housley, and Ray Pelletier. In addition to the members of the IAOC and IAB in conjunction with those roles, major and minor contributions were made by (in alphabetical order): Bob Braden, Brian Carpenter, Sandy Ginoza, Alice Hagens, Joel M. Halpern, Alfred Hoenes, Paul Hoffman, John Klensin, Subramanian Moonesamy, and Jim Schaad.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.2">The IAOC members at the time the RFC Editor model was approved were (in alphabetical order): Fred Baker, Bob Hinden, Russ Housley, Ole Jacobsen, Ed Juskevicius, Olaf Kolkman, Ray Pelletier (non-voting), Lynn St.Amour, and Jonne Soininen.  In addition, Marshall Eubanks was serving as the IAOC Scribe.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.3">The IAB members at the time the initial RFC Editor model was approved were (in alphabetical order): Loa Andersson, Gonzalo Camarillo, Stuart Cheshire, Russ Housley, Olaf Kolkman, Gregory Lebovitz, Barry Leiba, Kurtis Lindqvist, Andrew Malis, Danny McPherson, David Oran, Dave Thaler, and Lixia Zhang.  In addition, the IAB included two ex-officio members: Dow Street, who was serving as the IAB Executive Director, and Aaron Falk, who was serving as the IRTF Chair.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.4">The IAB members at the time the this RFC was approved were (in alphabetical order): Marcelo Bagnulo, Gonzalo Camarillo, Stuart Cheshire, Vijay Gill, Russ Housley, John Klensin, Olaf Kolkman, Gregory Lebovitz, Andrew Malis, Danny McPherson, David Oran, Jon Peterson, and Dave Thaler.  </p>
