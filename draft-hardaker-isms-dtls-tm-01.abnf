   The above entry indicates the CommonName field for that particular
   Issuer will be trusted to always produce common names that are
   directly 1 to 1 mappable into SNMPv3 securityNames.  This type of
   configuration should only be used when the CA is carefully
   controlled.

   For the example, if the incoming DTLS client provided certificate
   contained a Subject with a CommonName of "blueberry" and the
   certificate was signed by the CA matching the dtlstmCertIssuerDN
   value above and the CA's certificate was properly installed on the
   device then the CommonName of "blueberry" would be used as the
   securityName for the session.
