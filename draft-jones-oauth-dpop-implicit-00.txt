                  OAuth 2.0 DPoP for the Implicit Flow
                   draft-jones-oauth-dpop-implicit-00

Abstract

   This specification describes a mechanism for sender-constraining
   OAuth 2.0 tokens via a proof-of-possession mechanism on the
   application level.  This mechanism allows for the detection of replay
   attacks with access tokens.

   This specification compliments and builds upon the mechanisms defined
   in draft-fett-oauth-dpop, in which access tokens are returned from
   the token endpoint.  In particular, this specification extends the
   Demonstration of Proof-of-Possession at the Application Layer (DPoP)
   mechanisms to also be usable with the OAuth 2.0 implicit flow, in
   which access tokens are returned from the authorization endpoint.

1.  Introduction

   This specification defines additions to the mechanisms defined in
   [I-D.fett-oauth-dpop] enabling Demonstration of Proof-of-Possession
   at the Application Layer (DPoP) mechanisms to be used with the OAuth
   2.0 implicit flow, in which access tokens are returned from the
   authorization endpoint.  These additions are intended for use with
   these "response_type" values: "token", "id_token token",
   "code token", and "code id_token token".

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms "access token", "authorization
   endpoint", "authorization request", and "token endpoint" defined by
   The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework [RFC6749].

2.  DPoP for the Implicit Flow

   Demonstration of Proof-of-Possession at the Application Layer (DPoP)
   for the implicit flow is performed in the same manner as
   [I-D.fett-oauth-dpop], with this exception: Rather than sending the
   DPoP proof JWT in a DPoP HTTP header, the DPoP proof JWT is instead
   sent as the value the new "dpop" OAuth request parameter, which is
   defined in this section.

2.1.  DPoP OAuth Request Parameter

   This specification defines the following OAuth request parameter for
   use at the authorization endpoint:

   dpop
      The DPoP proof JWT for requests using the implicit flow.

2.2.  DPoP Proof JWT for the Implicit Flow

   DPoP proof JWTs used with the implicit flow are as specified in
   [I-D.fett-oauth-dpop], with the following modifications.

   o  The value of the "htm" claim MUST be the HTTP verb used in the
      authorization request, which is normally "GET".

   o  The value of the "htu" claim MUST be the URL of the authorization
      endpoint used in the request.

3.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations described in [I-D.fett-oauth-dpop] also
   apply to this specification.

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  OAuth Parameters Registration

   This specification registers the following value in the IANA "OAuth
   Parameters" registry [IANA.OAuth.Parameters] established by
   [RFC6749].
