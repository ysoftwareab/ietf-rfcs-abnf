Abstract 
    
   This document is regarding extended label distribution method using 
   Mobile IP registration and binding protocols. The document specifies 
   a novel method in which the label mapping information for a 
   particular mobile registration is piggybacked or placed in the same 
   Mobile IP registration request and response message. To apply this 
   same method to the route optimization protocol in Mobile IP, the 
   label mapping information is piggybacked or placed in the binding 
   update request message. The label mapping information is carried 
   using Mobile IP registration extensions. The document also addresses 
   the applicability of this label distribution method in GRE, MPLS and 
   IPv6 networks. 
    
    
1. Introduction 
         
   Mobile IP facilitates mobility of nodes that move from one network 
   to another network without changing the IP address of the node. When 
   mobile node moves to a foreign network, a router in the foreign 
   network, named as the foreign agent (FA), provides the routing 
   capability to the mobile node. The router in its home network, named

   as the home agent (HA), intercepts the topologically routed packets 
   destined for the mobile node (MN) and tunnels them to the mobile 
   node. The Home Agent uses a binding entry to find the end point of 
   the tunnel. The tunnel end point could be the Mobile Node itself 
   (when using co-located care-of-address) or the Foreign Agent (when 
   using the care-of-address of the Foreign Agent). 
    
   When the MN moves to a foreign network, it registers its current 
   point of attachment with the HA so that HA can correctly deliver the 
   packets to the MN. The registration procedure is done using a Mobile 
   IP registration request and reply message exchange. The MN sends a 
   registration request message containing it∆s care-of-address to the 
   HA. Up on receiving the registration request, the HA updates its 
   binding list entry (which is an association of MN home address and 
   its care-of-address) and sends a successful registration reply 
   message back to the MN. 
    
   Packets sent by the Correspondent Node (the node with which the 
   mobile node is communicating) will always get topologically routed 
   to the HA and the HA refers to the binding cache list to obtain 
   forwarding information for sending packets to the MN. This could be 
   avoided by updating the binding cache in the Correspondent Node (CN) 
   or the router to which the CN is connected, with the new care-of-
   address of the MN. In this way the CN can send packets directly to 
   the MN using the binding cache. In order to facilitate this, the HA 
   should send a binding update to the CN or the attached router. This 
   is the route optimization technique. 
    
   The table lookup function performed in every network node based on 
   the destination IP address and other parameters, in conventional IP 
   routing implementations is computationally a very expensive and 
   complex operation. This has led to the introduction of MPLS in IP 
   networks. The main concept behind MPLS is to append fixed-length 
   labels on each packet to be forwarded by a network node.  The label 
   summarizes all the forwarding information about how to forward the 
   packet on each next hop along the path towards a destination.  
   Forwarding decisions based on a combination of different sources of 
   information can be achieved with a single table lookup from a fixed-
   length label, resulting in a much more efficient and feasible 
   forwarding operation. All other MPLS nodes which forward this packet 
   always look up the label and then forward the packet to the next hop 
   by inserting another appropriate label. The label, which has to be 
   placed along with the packet when the packet is forwarded, is 
   distributed using label distribution protocols, such as LDP. Other 
   protocols, such as BGP4, PIM and RSVP, can be used to piggyback the 
   label. This explained method is concerned with forwarding packets 
   between adjacent nodes. In certain cases, like VPNs, there will be 
   forwarding requirements between nodes, which are not adjacent. Such 
   nodes are known as explicit label distribution pair-nodes. In such 
   cases, CRLDP and RSVP are used to explicitly setup a label switched 
   path  (LSP)  [10][11]  with  constraints,  to  support  traffic 
   engineering, QoS, etc.

   For Mobile IP networks, it is possible to set up an LSP between the 
   Home agent and the mobile node care-of-address (foreign agent) (and 
   between the correspondent node or the router to which it is 
   connected and the mobile node care-of-address) using existing label 
   distribution protocols [8][9]. These protocols talk about the label 
   distribution only for the LSP tunnel between HA and FA. However, for 
   the explicit label distribution for the mobile node connections, 
   these protocols require a separate invocation and control processing 
   step to be taken after the Mobile IP registration process is 
   completed.    This  sequential  processing  dependency  introduces 
   additional overhead and is vulnerable to errant generation of 
   inconsistent forwarding information due to the dynamic mobility of 
   routing destinations in a Mobile IP network environment. 
    
   In this document, we describe an explicit label distribution method 
   using Mobile IP protocol. The advantages of using this protocol are: 
    
     (1)  Improve the scalability of Mobile IP networks by simplifying 
          the data forwarding process leveraging on the features of 
          MPLS, such as fast switching and small state maintenance. 
     (2)  Synchronize  label  switch  path  set  up  with  Mobile  Node 
          registration process. 
     (3)  Simplify control state machine by eliminating a separate 
          signaling protocol transaction to establish label switch 
          path. 
    
    
   MPLS is not the only mechanism which can carry labeled packets. GRE 
   and Ipv6 packets can also carry labels. GRE packets has a 32-bit 
   session key to carry the labels. Ipv6 flow-labels or destination 
   headers options can carry labels. We also discuss the applicability 
   of label distribution and forwarding for GRE tunnels, IPv6 networks 
   and MPLS networks.

3. Label assignment and applicability 
 
3.1 Foreign Agent 
    
   One of the key advantages presented here is an efficient label 
   lookup and switching mechanism to select the outbound network 
   interface and apply label information for forwarding data packets

   along a path towards the mobile node when the foreign agent receives 
   a packet from the Home Agent. This draft proposes the label 
   switching approach instead of conventional IP packet forwarding 
   approach based on the IP address and port lookup mechanism. The 
   foreign agent could assign unique label to each mobile node and 
   communicate the label information to the home agent or correspondent 
   node  while  performing  the  mobile  IP  registration  process. 
   Specifically, foreign agent places a label extension field in the 
   registration request message when forwarding to the home agent. The 
   home agent or correspondent node could label the packet when 
   forwarding data packets to the foreign agent; which could use the 
   label for forwarding to the correct mobile node. The label is placed 
   either as MPLS label, or GRE key field or IPv6 flow-label id or 
   destination option, whichever is supported.  
    
   If MPLS is supported on the path between the Mobile Node and the 
   Foreign Agent, then MPLS label swapping can be used to switch 
   traffic between these two systems. In this case, the foreign agent 
   will be a custom LSR implementation having the capability of 
   distributing explicit labels. If the network between mobile node and 
   foreign agent is not MPLS capable, the label could be used to search 
   for index of the network interface and route to be used to forward 
   data packets to the mobile node using conventional IP routing 
   method. In this case, foreign agent will be a LER having capability 
   to pass this explicit label for finding mobile node interface.   
    
   On the other hand, if GRE or Ipv6 data packet forwarding is used, 
   foreign agent implementation should be able to pass the session key 
   or label to the appropriate searching module for finding the mobile 
   node interface. 
    
    
3.2 Home Agent 
    
   The home agent assigns a label for the MN and places it in the label 
   extension field in the registration reply message when the HA 
   receives a registration request message from the MN containing a 
   label extension field.  
    
   In reverse tunneling mode, the HA should distribute labels to each 
   MN sessions.  Two possible cases of label assignment distributed by 
   the HA to each MN up on registration request are:  
    
   (1)  Home agent can apply QoS/IPSec/NAT policies to each of these 
        mobile nodes. 
   (2)  Home agent can establish a L2TP session and bind it to each MN. 
    
   In either case, Home agent can identify each of these mobile 
   sessions using the label, which is present in the user traffic 
   datagram header. The HA can also do label switching for the received 
   packets from the FA, depending upon the network between HA and 
   correspondent node. If MPLS is supported on the path between CN and 
   HA, then MPLS label swapping can be used to switch traffic received

   from FA. In this case, the home agent will be a custom LSR 
   implementation  having  the  capability  of  distributing  explicit 
   labels. If the network between CN and HA is not MPLS capable, the 
   label could be used to search the session entry and associated route 
   to be used to forward data packets to the correspondent node. In 
   this case, home agent will be a LER having capability to pass this 
   explicit label for finding the session entry and associated route. 
    
   On the other hand, if GRE or Ipv6 data packet forwarding is used, 
   home agent implementation should be able to pass the session key or 
   label to the appropriate searching module for finding the session 
   and route to forward the data to the correspondent node. 
 
    
3.3 Correspondent node  
    
   The scenario is used when route optimization is used in mobile IP. 
   This case has still unresolved issues like security in sending  
   binding updates to the correspondent node or router to which it is 
   connected. 
    
   The home agent can place the label extension (provided by the 
   foreign  agent  in  the  registration  request)  in  the  binding 
   registration  entry,  when  sending  a  binding  update  to  the 
   correspondent node. The correspondent node can label the packet 
   using the label present in the binding entry when forwarding any 
   traffic to mobile node, in the same way that the home agent does 
   when forwarding traffic to mobile node. 
 
4. Label distribution using Mobile IP 
    
   The mobile IP label distribution is done in registration request, 
   registration reply and binding update. 
    
4.1 Label extension 
    
   The label extension in the mobile IP registration messages explained 
   below. This extension is non-skippable. 
    
    0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |     Type      |    Length     |L|G|P|     Reserved            | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |                Label                  | Exp |S|       TTL     |  
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
    
   Type:   Identify the extension as a label (50 ˚ to be assigned) 
   Length: Length of this extension in bytes excluding Type and Length 
           (i.e. this will be 6 bytes) 
   L bit: This bit says that sender of this extension uses MPLS label  
          Encoding. If this bit is set, the 32-bit label will be  
          encode as 20bit label, Exp bits, S-bit, and TTL format.

       < draft-shaji-mobileip-generic-label-ext-00.txt >    Sept. 2001 
 
 
   G bit: This bit says that sender of this extension uses GRE session  
          key for label encoding. If this bit is set, the label will  
          be a 32-bit GRE session key. 
   P bit: This bit says that sender of this extension uses Ipv6 
          destination option for label encoding. If this bit is set, 
          the label will be in MPLS-label format. 
   Reserved: These bits will be set to zero by the sender and ignored 
            by the receiver. 
   The below will be the fields when MPLS label encoding format is 
   used. 
    
   Label:  Label Value, 20 bits 
   Exp:    Experimental Use, 3 bits 
   S:      Bottom of Stack, 1 bit 
   TTL:    Time To Live field 
        
   The foreign agent should place the label extension after the fixed 
   part of mobile Home extensions. The FA-HA authentication extension 
   is placed after the label extension so that security is applied to 
   label extension. Similarly, the Home agent should place the label 
   extension after the Mobile-Home Authentication and before any HA-FA 
   authentication extension.  
    
    If ÊS∆ bit is set, normal MPLS label stacking is used. 
     
   Home agent MUST place the same label extension, received in the 
   registration request, in the registration reply. If home agent does 
   so, the label extension assigned by the home agent MUST be placed 
   after the label extension present in the request message. Placing 
   the  same  label  extension,  present  in  the  request,  in  the 
   registration reply helps foreign agent to easily identify the 
   pending registration entry. Different Type Values are assigned for 
   each type of labels. 
                    
4.2 Label distribution by foreign agent 
    
   Foreign agent assigns unique label to each of the mobile node 
   connected. When foreign agent relays the registration request to the 
   home agent, it places the label extension (with the label value for 
   the mobile node) in the registration request. When the home agent 
   receives this registration request, it updates the binding table 
   with the label.  
    
   A sample registration request relayed by FA to HA is shown below. 
   ÊLm∆ is the label assigned by the FA for the mobile session. 
    
       0                   1                   2                   3

4.3 Label distribution by home agent 
    
   The home agent can assign unique labels to each of the L2TP sessions 
   for the VPNs. Home Agent can also assign labels for each mobile node 
   for QoS support. HA needs not assign any such labels, if it cannot 
   identify the session or flow associated with the correspondent node. 
   Home agent sends these label information in the registration reply. 
   The foreign agent when accepts successful reply from the home agent, 
   updates the registration table with the new label received in the 
   reply.   
    
   A sample registration reply from HA to FA is shown below. 
   ÊLh∆ is the label assigned by the HA for the mobile initiated 
   session.

4.4 Label distribution for route optimization 
    
   When the home agent sends the binding update request to the 
   correspondent node (or the router to which it is attached), it 
   includes the label extension, assigned by the foreign agent, with 
   the label value found in the binding entry for mobile node. The 
   correspondent node uses this label when forwarding any traffic to 
   the mobile node. 
    
4.5 Label distribution between foreign agent and mobile node 
    
   The problem and solution stated in this section is when mobile node 
   uses IPv4 co-located care-of-address. In this case, the FA acts as a 
   default router, and FA always insists registration to be done with 
   FA (due to billing or accounting issues). In this case FA will be 
   doing normal routing for the co-located care-of address for traffic 
   from Internet to MN. FA does the following additional functions to 
   this traffic. 
    
   (1)  If  the  network  between  mobile  node  and  FA  uses  GRE 
        encapsulation for packet delivery, FA uses the GRE session key 
        to  select  the  interface  port  for  the  mobile  node.  This 
        essentially requires snooping of IP packets for GRE session key 
        before forwarding to the mobile node. 
   (2)  If the network between mobile node and FA is MPLS capable, and 
        the tunnel end-point is mobile node and the LSP terminate in 
        mobile node. In this case, FA does label switching/swapping 
        functioning as a normal LSR. 
   (3)  If the network between mobile node and FA is not MPLS capable, 
        and mobile node uses co-located care-of-address. In this case, 
        the LSP should terminate in FA, and the label  used to select 
        the interface for the mobile node. Here FA function as custom

        LER capable of providing label to the module, which does a fast 
        lookup based on the label, to find out the mobile node 
        interface. 
    
   The third case is supported by terminating the LSP in the FA; and 
   home  agent  is  completely  transparent  to  this.  Two  possible 
   approaches to identify the capability of the mobile node are as 
   follows. 
    
   The first approach is to use a bit flag, to inform that Foreign 
   Agent is MPLS capable, in agent advertisement. The mobile node could 
   place its MPLS capability in registration request using an unused 
   bit. That is, use bit flags in agent advertisement and registration 
   requests. 
           
   Second approach is to place a label extension in agent advertisement 
   and return the same label extension in registration request by the 
   mobile node. If the mobile node is not returning the same label 
   extension, FA can assume that it is not MPLS path and could use 
   proxy-MPLS service for the mobile node. 
    
   Since both the explained above approaches require a change in the 
   mobile node, these may not be recommended to do so. Hence, foreign 
   agent may be statically configured to recognize the capabilities. 
    
5. User Traffic Processing Considerations 
    
5.1 Packet forwarding by foreign agent 
    
   When the foreign agent sends a packet to the home agent (reverse 
   tunnels), if any label exists (i.e. home agent sends the label in 
   the Registration Reply), the FA places the label before forwarding 
   the packet. Depending upon the tunneling mechanisms used between FA 
   and HA, three possible cases of placing the label are: 
   (1)  If the foreign agent and home agent use Ipv4 GRE tunnels, the 
        label is placed in the GRE session Id. 
   (2)  If the foreign agent and home agent are MPLS capable, this 
        label is pushed into the label stack, followed by the normal 
        MPLS labels for the LSP between FA and HA.

   (3)  If the foreign agent and home agent are Ipv6 capable (not MPLS 
        capable), the label is placed in the flow-label id or Ipv6 
        Destination options. 
    
   In the case of open Internet traffic, where reverse tunneling is not 
   done, it may not able to place the explicit labels, unless otherwise 
   negotiated an explicit LSP between FA and the communicating node. 
    
5.2 Packet forwarding by home agent  
    
   When the home agent sends a packet to the care-of-address (foreign 
   agent), if a label exist in the binding entry, the HA places the 
   label before sending out the packet. Depending upon the tunneling 
   method used, three possible cases of placing the label are: 
 
   (1)  If the foreign agent and home agent use Ipv4 GRE tunnels, the 
        label is placed in the GRE key field. 
   (2)  If the foreign agent and home agent are MPLS capable, this 
        label is pushed into the label stack, followed by the normal 
        MPLS label for the LSP.

   (3)  If the foreign agent and home agent are Ipv6 capable (not MPLS 
        capable),  the  label  is  placed  in  the  flow-label  id  or 
        destination options. 
    
5.3 Packet forwarding for Route Optimization 
    
   When route optimization is used, the correspondent node or the 
   attached router places the label information present in the binding 
   entry when sending any traffic to the mobile node, in a similar way 
   home agent does. 
    
5.4 Packet reception by foreign agent 
    
   When foreign agent receives a packet from the HA, it uses the MPLS 
   label for the following: 
    

  
Radhakrishnan & Xu & Wong       Expires Feb. 2002                   10 

       < draft-shaji-mobileip-generic-label-ext-00.txt >    Sept. 2001 
 
 
   (1)  If the mobile node network side supports MPLS, the label is 
        swapped (normal MPLS processing). Here, as explained before, 
        Foreign agent will be a custom LSR capable of distributing 
        explicit labels. 
   (2)  If the mobile node side only supports normal IP processing, the 
        label is used to select the appropriate mobile node session. 
    
   If the label is the GRE session key in the GRE tunneled packets from 
   the home agent, this session is used to select the appropriate 
   mobile node interface for tunneling the packets to the mobile  node. 
   Similar approach is done for tunneled Ipv6 packets also. 
    
   5.5 Packet reception by home agent 
   The home agent can be either a custom LSR which should be able to 
   receive labeled packets from the FA and forward them to the 
   correspondent node. In this case, both sides of HA are MPLS 
   networks. If the network between HA and correspondent node is not 
   MPLS capable, where the network between FA and HA is MPLS capable, 
   then when home agent receives a packet from the FA (which are 
   reverse tunneled), it uses the inner MPLS label for the following: 
    
   (1)  Home agent could select the appropriate L2TP sessions, if the 
        label is allocated for each L2TP session. 
   (2)  If the label is allocated for QoS for the mobile node, the 
        label is used to apply appropriate QoS policies. 
   (3)  If the label is allocated for Ipsec or NAT for the mobile node, 
        the label is used to apply appropriate IpSec or NAT policies. 
    
   Similarly, on the other hand if GRE (or Ipv6) is tunneling is used 
   by FA to reverse tunnel the packets to HA, when HA receives the GRE 
   tunneled packets, the GRE session key (or Ipv6 label) is used to do 
   any one of the above 3 selection of appropriate sessions. 
    
6. Advantages of mobile IP label distribution  
    
   The following are the advantages of using mobile IP for label 
   distribution over conventional label distribution methods. 
    
   (a)  It is less overhead and fast; since label distribution is done 
        as part of mobile IP registration. 
   (b)  No separate label distribution protocol is needed for explicit 
        label negotiation. 
   (c)  Negotiating  explicit  label  distribution  using  a  different 
        protocol is not recommended since mobile IP registration is 
        very dynamic in nature. 
   (d)  The  mobile  node  information  and  label  will  always  be 
        synchronized since mobile IP is used for label distribution. 
   (e)  Label distribution is implicitly secure by Mobile IP. 
   (f)  Label release is done by mobile IP when binding expires 
    
   By  comparison,  if  label  distribution  (for  mobile  IP)  using 
   conventional MPLS LDP protocol is used to support Mobile IP, the 
   following sequence of steps has to be performed in sequence:

       < draft-shaji-mobileip-generic-label-ext-00.txt >    Sept. 2001 
 
 
    
        (1)  First do mobile IP registrations 
        (2)  Negotiate explicit label between HA and FA using existing 
             protocol. 
        (3)  Extra security needs to be introduced for step (2). 
        (4)  Negotiate MPLS labels between neighbors 
    
   Now  steps  (1)  and  (2)  are  required  for  every  mobile  node 
   registrations. Also step (2) & (3) for each mobile IP registration 
   introduces lots of overhead for conventional label distribution. 
    
   But using mobile IP label distribution, step (1) and step (2) are 
   combined to just one step. 
    
7. Summary 
    
   A new mobile IP label extension is proposed to distribute labels 
   using  mobile  IP  registration  request/reply  and  binding  update 
   message exchanges. These labels are places as GRE sessions key, or 
   MPLS  labels  or  Ipv6  labels  when  packets  are  forwarded  using 
   respective technology. 
    
8. IANA Considerations 
    
   The label extension placed by the foreign agent in the registration 
   request (defined in section 4.1) SHOULD be assigned the Type value 
   of 50 (to be assigned by IANA). The label extension placed by the 
   home agent in the registration reply SHOULD be assigned the Type 
   value of 51 (to be assigned by IANA).  
 
   With this assignment, the Type value assigned to the label extension 
   have been identified as not conflicting with any numbers defined for 
   Mobile  IP  to  date  and  documented  at  http://www.isi.edu/in-
   notes/iana/assignments/mobileip-numbers.  
    
    
9. Security Considerations 
    
   There no additional security required for label distribution since 
   it is covered by the mobile IP registration messages.
