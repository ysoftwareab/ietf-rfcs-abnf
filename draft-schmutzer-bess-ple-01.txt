1.  Introduction and Motivations

   This document describes a method for encapsulating high-speed bit-
   streams as VPWS over packet switched networks (PSN).  This emulation
   suits applications where complete signal transparency is required and
   data interpretation of the PE would be counter productive.

   One example is two ethernet connected CEs and the need for
   synchronous ethernet operation between then without the intermediate
   PEs interfering.  Another example is addressing common ethernet
   control protocol transparency concerns for carrier ethernet services,
   beyond the behavior definitions of MEF specifications.

   The mechanisms described in this document allow the transport of
   signals from many technologies such as ethernet, fibre channel,
   SONET/SDH [GR253]/[G.707] and OTN [G.709] by treating them as bit-
   stream payload defined in Section 3.3.3 of [RFC3985].

2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP

   o  VPWS - Virtual Private Wire Service

   Similarly to [RFC4553] and [RFC5086] the term Interworking Function
   (IWF) is used to describe the functional block that encapsulates bit
   streams into PLE packets and in the reverse direction decapsulates
   PLE packets and reconstructs bit streams.

3.2.  Reference Models

   The generic models defined in [RFC4664] are applicable to PLE.

   PLE embraces the minimum intervention principle outlined in section
   3.3.5 of [RFC3985] whereas the data is flowing through the PLE
   encapsulation layer as received without modifications.

   For some applications the NSP function is responsible for performing
   operations on the native data received from the CE.  Examples are
   terminating FEC in case of 100GE or terminating the OTUk layer for
   OTN.  After the NSP the IWF is generating the payload of the VPWS
   which carried via a PSN tunnel.

   model and deployment scenario outlined in section 4.3.2 of [RFC4197]
   is applicable.

   The attachment circuit clock E is generated by PE2 in reference to a
   common clock I.  For this to work the difference between clock I and
   A MUST be explicitly transferred between the PE1 and PE2 using the
   timestamp inside the RTP header.

   For the reverse direction PE1 does generate the clock J in reference
   to clock I and the clock difference between I and G.

4.1.  PSN and VPWS Demultiplexing Headers

   This document does not imply any specific technology to be used for
   implementing the VPWS demultiplexing and PSN layers.

   When a MPLS PSN layer is used.  A VPWS label provides the
   demultiplexing mechanism as described in section 5.4.2 of [RFC3985].
   The PSN tunnel can be a simple best path Label Switched Path (LSP)
   established using LDP [RFC5036] or Segment Routing [RFC8402] or a
   traffic engineered LSP established using RSVP-TE [RFC3209] or SR-TE
   [SRPOLICY].

   When PLE is applied to a SRv6 based PSN, the mechanisms defined in
   [RFC8402] and the End.DX2 endpoint behavior defined in [SRV6NETPROG]
   do apply.

4.2.  PLE Header

   The PLE header MUST contain the PLE control word (4 bytes) and MUST
   include a fixed size RTP header [RFC3550].  The RTP header MUST
   immediately follow the PLE control word.

4.2.1.  PLE Control Word

   The format of the PLE control word is inline with the guidance in
   [RFC4385] and as shown in the below figure:


       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

      |0 0 0 0|L|R|RSV|FRG|   LEN     |       Sequence number         |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                        Figure 4: PLE Control Word

   The first nibble is used to differentiate if it is a control word or
   Associated Channel Header (ACH).  The first nibble MUST be set to
   0000b to indicate that this header is a control word as defined in
   section 3 of [RFC4385].

   The other fields in the control word are used as defined below:

   L

      Set by the PE to indicate that data carried in the payload is
      invalid due to an attachment circuit fault (client signal

      failure).  The downstream PE MUST play out an appropriate
      replacement data.  The NSP MAY inject an appropriate native fault
      propagation signal.

   R

      Set by the downstream PE to indicate that the IWF experiences
      packet loss from the PSN or a server layer backward fault
      indication is present in the NSP.  The R bit MUST be cleared by
      the PE once the packet loss state or fault indication has cleared.

   RSV

      These bits are reserved for future use.  This field MUST be set to
      zero by the sender and ignored by the receiver.

   FRG

      These bits MUST be set to zero by the sender and ignored by the
      receiver except for frame aligned payloads; see Section 5.2

   LEN

      In accordance to [RFC4385] section 3 the length field MUST always
      be set to zero as there is no padding added to the PLE packet.  To
      detect malformed packets the default, preconfigured or signaled
      payload size MUST be assumed.

   Sequence Number

      The sequence number field is used to provide a common PW
      sequencing function as well as detection of lost packets.  It MUST
      be generated in accordance with the rules defined in Section 5.1
      of [RFC3550] for the RTP sequence number and MUST be incremented
      with every PLE packet being sent.

4.2.2.  RTP Header

   The RTP header MUST be included and is used for explicit transfer of
   timing information.  The RTP header is purely a formal reuse and RTP
   mechanisms, such as header extensions, contributing source (CSRC)
   list, padding, RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), RTP header compression,
   Secure Realtime Transport Protocol (SRTP), etc., are not applicable
   to PLE VPWS.

   The format of the RTP header is as shown in the below figure:

      The CC field MUST be set to zero by the sender and ignored by the
      receiver.

   M: Marker

      The M bit MUST be set to zero by sender and ignored by receiver.

   PT: Payload Type

      A PT value MUST be allocated from the range of dynamic values
      define by [RFC3551] for each direction of the VPWS.  The same PT
      value MAY be reused both for direction and between different PLE
      VPWS.

   Sequence Number

      The packet sequence number MUST continuously cycle from 0 to
      0xFFFF.  It is generated and processed in accordance with the
      rules established in [RFC3550].  The PLE receiver MUST sequence
      packets according to the Sequence Number field of the PLE control

      word and MAY verify correct sequencing using RTP Sequence Number
      field.

   Timestamp

      Timestamp values are used in accordance with the rules established
      in [RFC3550].  For bit-streams up to 200 Gbps the frequency of the
      clock used for generating timestamps MUST be 125 MHz based on a
      the common clock I.  For bit-streams above 200 Gbps the frequency
      MUST be 250 MHz.

   SSRC: Synchronization Source

      The SSRC field MAY be used for detection of misconnections.

5.  PLE Payload Layer

5.1.  Constant Bit Rate Payload

   A bit-stream is mapped into a packet with a fixed payload size
   ignoring any structure being present.  The number of bytes MUST be
   defined during VPWS setup, MUST be the same in both directions of the
   VPWS and MUST remain unchanged for the lifetime of the VPWS.

   For constant bit rate payloads the PLE packet is filled with incoming
   bits of the bit stream starting from the most significant to the
   least significant bit.

   All PLE implementations MUST be capable of supporting the default
   payload size of 1024 bytes.

   For PCS based CE interface types supporting FEC the NSP function MUST
   terminate the FEC and pass the PCS encoded signal to the IWF
   function.

   For PCS based CE interface types supporting virtual lanes (i.e.
   100GE) a PLE payload MUST carry information from all virtual lanes in
   a bit interleaved manner after the NSP function has performed PCS
   layer de-skew and re-ordering.

   A PLE implementation MUST support the transport of all service types
   except ODUk bit-streams using the constant bit rate payload.

5.2.  Byte aligned Payload

   In case of an OTN bit-stream, the NSP function MUST present to the
   IWF an extended ODUk including a valid frame alignment overhead.  The
   IWF is performing byte-aligned mapping into PLE packets.  The egress

Internet-Draft                     PLE                     November 2020


   NSP function will recover the ODUk by searching for the frame
   alignment overhead.

   For byte aligned payloads PLE uses the following order for
   packetization:

   o  The order of the payload bytes corresponds to their order on the
      attachment circuit.

   o  Consecutive bits coming from the attachment circuit fill each
      payload byte starting from most significant bit to least
      significant.

   All PLE implementations MUST support the payload size of 1024 bytes.

   All PLE implementations MUST support the transport of OTN bit-streams
   using the byte aligned payload.

6.  PLE Operation

6.1.  Common Considerations

   A PLE VPWS can be established using manual configuration or
   leveraging mechanisms of a signalling protocol

   Furthermore emulation of bit-stream signals using PLE is only
   possible when the two attachment circuits of the VPWS are of the same
   type (OC192, 10GBASE-R, ODU2, etc) and are using the same PLE payload
   type and payload size.  This can be ensured via manual configuration
   or via a signalling protocol

   Extensions to the PWE3 [RFC4447] and EVPN-VPWS [RFC8214] control
   protocols are described in a separate document [PLESIG].

6.2.  PLE IWF Operation

6.2.1.  PSN-bound Encapsulation Behavior

   After the VPWS is set up, the PSN-bound IWF does perform the
   following steps:

   o  Packetise the data received from the CE is into a fixed size PLE
      payloads

   o  Add PLE control word and RTP header with sequence numbers, flags
      and timestamps properly set

   o  Add the VPWS demultiplexer and PSN headers



Gringeri, et al.           Expires May 6, 2021                 [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                     PLE                     November 2020


   o  Transmit the resulting packets over the PSN

   o  Set L bit in the PLE control word whenever attachment circuit
      detects a fault

   o  Set R bit in the PLE control word whenever the local CE-bound IWF
      is in packet loss state

6.2.2.  CE-bound Decapsulation Behavior

   The CE-bound IWF is responsible for removing the PSN and VPWS
   demultiplexing headers, PLE control word and RTP header from the
   received packet stream and play-out of the bit-stream to the local
   attachment circuit.

   A de-jitter buffer MUST be implemented where the PLE packets are
   stored upon arrival.  The size of this buffer SHOULD be locally
   configurable to allow accommodation of specific PSN packet delay
   variation expected.

   The CE-bound IWF SHOULD use the sequence number in the control word
   to detect lost and mis-ordered packets.  It MAY use the sequence
   number in the RTP header for the same purposes.

   The payload of a lost packet MUST be replaced with equivalent amount
   of replacement data.  The contents of the replacement data MAY be
   locally configurable.  All PLE implementations MUST support
   generation of "0xAA" as replacement data.  The alternating sequence
   of 0s and 1s of the "0xAA" pattern does ensure clock synchronization
   is maintained.  While playing out the replacement data, the IWF will
   apply a holdover mechanism to maintain the clock.

   Whenever the VPWS is not operationally up, the CE-bound NSP function
   MUST inject the appropriate native downstream fault indication signal
   (for example ODUk-AIS or ethernet LF).

   Whenever a VPWS comes up, the CE-bound IWF enters the intermediate
   state, will start receiving PLE packets and will store them in the
   jitter buffer.  The CE-bound NSP function will continue to inject the
   appropriate native downstream fault indication signal until a pre-
   configured amount of payloads is stored in the jitter buffer.

   After the pre-configured amount of payload is present in the jitter
   buffer the CE-bound IWF transitions to the normal operation state and
   the content of the jitter buffer is played out to the CE in
   accordance with the required clock.  In this state the CE-bound IWF
   MUST perform egress clock recovery.




Gringeri, et al.           Expires May 6, 2021                 [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                     PLE                     November 2020


   The recovered clock MUST comply with the jitter and wander
   requirements applicable to the type of attachment circuit, specified
   in:

   o  [G.825] and [G.823] for SDH

   o  [GR253] for SONET

   o  [G.8261] for synchronous ethernet

   o  [G.8251] for OTN

   Whenever the L bit is set in the PLE control word of a received PLE
   packet the CE-bound NSP function SHOULD inject the appropriate native
   downstream fault indication signal instead of playing out the
   payload.

   If the CE-bound IWF detects loss of consecutive packets for a pre-
   configured amount of time (default is 1 millisecond), it enters
   packet loss (PLOS) state and a corresponding defect is declared.

   If the CE-bound IWF detects a packet loss ratio (PLR) above a
   configurable signal-degrade (SD) threshold for a configurable amount
   of consecutive 1-second intervals, it enters the degradation (DEG)
   state and a corresponding defect is declared.  Possible values for
   the SD-PLR threshold are between 1..100% with the default being 15%.
   Possible values for consecutive intervals are 2..10 with the default
   7.

   While either a PLOS or DEG defect is declared the CE-bound NSP
   function SHOULD inject the appropriate native downstream fault
   indication signal.  Also the PSN-bound IWF SHOULD set the R bit in
   the PLE control word of every packet transmitted.

   The CE-bound IWF does change from the PLOS to normal state after the
   pre-configured amount of payload has been received similarly to the
   transition from intermediate to normal state.

   Whenever the R bit is set in the PLE control word of a received PLE
   packet the PLE performance monitoring statistics SHOULD get updated.

6.3.  PLE Performance Monitoring

   PLE SHOULD provide the following functions to monitor the network
   performance to be inline with expectations of transport network
   operators.

   The near-end performance monitors defined for PLE are as follows:



Gringeri, et al.           Expires May 6, 2021                 [Page 13]

Internet-Draft                     PLE                     November 2020


      ES-PLE : PLE Errored Seconds

      SES-PLE : PLE Severely Errored Seconds

      UAS-PLE : PLE Unavailable Seconds

   Each second with at least one packet lost or a PLOS/DEG defect SHALL
   be counted as ES-PLE.  Each second with a PLR greater than 15% or a
   PLOS/DEG defect SHALL be counted as SES-PLE.

   UAS-PLE SHALL be counted after configurable number of consecutive
   SES-PLE have been observed, and no longer counted after a
   configurable number of consecutive seconds without SES-PLE have been
   observed.  Default value for each is 10 seconds.

   Once unavailability is detected, ES and SES counts SHALL be inhibited
   up to the point where the unavailability was started.  Once
   unavailability is removed, ES and SES that occurred along the
   clearing period SHALL be added to the ES and SES counts.

   A PLE far-end performance monitor is providing insight into the CE-
   bound IWF at the far end of the PSN.  The statistics are based on the
   PLE-RDI indication carried in the PLE control word via the R bit.

   The PLE VPWS performance monitors are derived from the definitions in
   accordance with [G.826]

6.4.  QoS and Congestion Control

   The PSN carrying PLE VPWS may be subject to congestion, but PLE VPWS
   representing constant bit-rate (CBR) flows cannot respond to
   congestion in a TCP-friendly manner as described in [RFC2913].

   Hence the PSN providing connectivity for the PLE VPWS between PE
   devices MUST be Diffserv [RFC2475] enabled and MUST provide a per
   domain behavior [RFC3086] that guarantees low jitter and low loss.

   To achieve the desired per domain behavior PLE VPWS SHOULD be carried
   over traffic-engineering paths through the PSN with bandwidth
   reservation and admission control applied.

7.  Security Considerations

   As PLE is leveraging VPWS as transport mechanism the security
   considerations described in [RFC7432] and [RFC3985] are applicable.
