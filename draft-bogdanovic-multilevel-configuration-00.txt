2.  Introduction

   As network operators experience traffic and customer growth, the
   network device configurations are getting larger.  All the config
   information, both network operator and customers, on the device is
   multiplexed into single file and the configuration differentiation
   belonging to different owners becomes harder.  This leads to the
   operators not knowing why certain parts of the config are in the
   file.  Another issue contributing to config growth are debugging
   sessions.  Network operator enters the device and starts editing
   configuration.  After the debug session is finnished, it is not
   unusual for debug configuration entries to stay in the config file
   indefinitely.

   In order to solve this problem, some operators created central
   database with all the network configuration files that act as systems
   of record.  If anything is to persist on the device in the network,
   it has to be in the central database.  Still, this solution has not
   remedided the problem.

   Both, vendors and operators, contribute to the problem:

   *  Vendors by keeping the configuration file structures as currently
      designed;

   *  Operators by allowing human operator to directly edit config file
      on the device.

   Until the above two issues are solved, the residual configuration
   problem will persist and continue to waste expensive data plane
   resources (TCAM).

   This draft authors are motivated to propose a solution from both
   sides, operator and vendor.  Our initial idea is to keep the
   persistent configuration at minimum on the device.  All network
   service configurations are generated on demand and are ephemeral.
   This requires a change to the config file structure, creating multi-
   level file structure with dependencies between different
   levels.Besides the residual configuration problem, there are other
   use cases that multi-level configuration can be applied, that are
   listed in this document.

3.  Use cases

3.1.  Service assurance

   Service assurance is one of the critical operational aspects of the
   communication networks.  As
   [I-D.claise-opsawg-service-assurance-architecture] states, services
   rely on multiple sub-services on top of the same underlying network,
   then service affection on any of those sub-services can propagate
   impacts to many other services in the network.  In this respect, the
   multi-level network configuration approach could help on identifying
   by design the correlation among services and atomic functions in the
   network, simplifying the operation and providing a uniform framework
   across networks.

3.2.  Network migrations and mergings

   Quite often service providers get involved in complex procedures of
   network mergings or migrations.  Either driven by simplification of
   existing networks, introduction of new services, rationalization of
   multiple infrastructures, acquisition of other providers, etc., all
   of them imply both the introduction and removal of distinct
   configurations of multiple purposes.  Apart of the complexity and
   difficulty of converging to a common and unique approach, these
   procedures could impact service continuity.  In this sense, multi-
   level network configuration could highly simplify the process.
   First, by dividing the problem in smaller pieces, dealing with the
   issue per configuration level instead of considering the whole
   configuration.  And second, by allowing incremental execution of the
   process by acting on particular levels each time.

3.3.  Network slicing

   Network slices are expected to provide tailored networks that can
   accommodate services with specific characteristics and service level
   objectives (SLOs) [I-D.nsdt-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition].  In
   this respect, the multi-level network configuration approach can be
   leveraged as a mean for deploying particular IETF network slices,
   facilitating the instantiation, operation and decommissioning of the
   slice in a straightforward manner.

3.4.  Zero touch provisioning

   [RFC8886] proposes a mechanism for remotely auto-installing
   configurations on network devices with proper confidentiality and
   security.  Such mechanism is conceived for receiving initial
   configuration by the device, for a later completion of the
   configuration by other means.  In this case, leveraging on multi-
   level network configuration could permit incremental deployment of
   configuration levels following a similar auto-installing approach,
   according to some configuration workflow as defined by the service
   provider.
