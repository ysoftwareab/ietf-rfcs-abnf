1. Introduction

   This document presents several logical and detailed scenarios which
   are intended to describe the potential configurations that can be
   realized when peering CDNs. The logical scenarios describe how
   various entities may combine to provide a complete CDN solution. The
   detailed scenarios describe the actual peering interactions between
   the various peered entities. These scenarios answer two distinct
   needs:

   1.  To provide some concrete examples of what CDN peering is, and

   2.  To provide a basis for evaluating CDN peering proposals.

   Each of the logical peering scenarios gives an indication of how the
   various CDN elements are combined. From [2] these elements are:

   1.  REDIRECTION PEERING SYSTEM

   2.  DISTRIBUTION PEERING SYSTEM

   3.  ACCOUNTING PEERING SYSTEM

   The peering scenarios presented in this document are also framed by
   the following concepts:

   1.  Content Has Value

   2.  Distribution Has Value

   3.  Users Have Value

   At present, the references to the above concepts are only employed
   when they directly affect the nature of the peering scenario. A
   reader who is interested in a detailed description of these concepts
   is referred to [3].

   Terms in ALL CAPS are defined in [1].

2. Logical Peering Scenarios

   This section provides several logical peering scenarios that may
   arise in peered CDN implementations.

2.1 Fundamental Concepts

   There are many potential peering configurations that can be imagined
   for peered CDNs. All of these configurations MUST adhere to the
   following concepts:

   There is only one FIRST-REDIRECTION system for a given set of
   CONTENT: 

      In order to prevent potential conflicts this document assumes
      that there is one and only one FIRST-REDIRECTION SYSTEM. All
      other REDIRECTION SYSTEMs MUST honor this relationship. 


   There may be more than one ACCOUNTING ENTITY: 

      These scenarios assume that multiple ACCOUNTING ENTITIES may
      coexist. These entities may require specific ACCOUNTING
      information or they may share this information depending upon the
      function that they provide. 


   There may be more than one DISTRIBUTING CDN: 

      These scenarios assume that multiple DISTRIBUTING CDNs may
      coexist. They further assume that these CDNs may have peering
      relationships that are outside the scope of the scenario being
      discussed. 


2.2 Expanding Existing CDN Footprint

   This scenario considers the case where two or more existing CDNs
   wish to peer in order to provide an increased scale and reach. It
   assumes that both of them already provide REDIRECTION, DISTRIBUTION,
   and ACCOUNTING services and that they will continue to provide these
   services to existing customers.

   In this scenario it is assumed that the peering relationship between
   all entities is comprised of; REDIRECTION PEERING, DISTRIBUTION
   PEERING, and ACCOUNTING PEERING.

   It is also worthwhile to consider that any one of these peered CDNs
   may also have other peering arrangements which may or may not be


Day & Gilletti           Expires March 27, 2001                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                   CDNPS                    September 2000


   transitive to peering relationships created for the above purpose.

2.3 ACCOUNTING and REDIRECTION PEERING Across Multiple DISTIBUTING CDNs

   This scenario describes the case where a single entity performs
   ACCOUNTING and REDIRECTION functions but has no inherent
   DISTRIBUTION capabilities. The ACCOUNTING and REDIRECTION ENTITY
   must therefore peer with one or more DISTRIBUTING CDNs in order to
   provide a complete solution.

   In this scenario the ACCOUNTING and REDIRECTION ENTITY, at a
   minumum, would enter into REDIRECTION PEERING and ACCOUNTING PEERING
   relationships with each of the DISTRIBUTING CDNs.

   The ACCOUNTING and REDIRECTION ENTITY could also play an active role
   in managing the DISTRIBUTION. In this case an additional
   DISTRIBUTION PEERING relationships are required.

   It is worth noting that the REDIRECTION ENTITY discussed here is
   typically the FIRST-REDIRECTION SYSTEM although that is not a
   requirement.

   It is also worthwhile to consider that any one of these peered
   ENTITIES may also have other peering arrangements which may or may
   not be transitive to peering relationships created for the above
   purpose.

2.4 ACCOUNTING PEERING Across Multiple DISTRIBUTING CDNs

   This scenario describes the case where a single BILLING ENTITY which
   provides a settlement/clearing-house function wishes to peer
   w/mulitple DISTRIBUTING CDNs. For the purposes of this scenario it
   is not necessary to consider the specifics of REDIRECTION PEERING.

   In this scenario the BILLING ENTITY would enter into ACCOUNTING
   PEERING relationships w/one or more DISTRIBUTING CDNs.

2.5 PUBLISHER peers w/multiple DISTRIBUTING CDNs

   This scenario describes the case where a PUBLISHER wishes to
   directly enter into peering relationships w/multiple DISTRIBUTING
   CDNs. In this scenario it is assumed that the PUBLISHER operates as
   the FIRST-REDIRECTION SYSTEM for its CONTENT although it is possible
   that this function may be designated to one of the DISTRIBUTING CDNs.

   In this scenario the PUBLISHER would enter into; DISTRIBUTION
   PEERING, ACCOUNTING PEERING, and REDIRECTION peering with one or
   more DISTRIBUTING CDNs.

3. Detailed Peering Scenarios

   The following text outlines what is intended to be a complete set of
   detailed scenarios that can arise at when peering CDNs. It provides
   additional detail around the following four areas:

   1.  Establishing/Terminating Peering

   2.  Distributing Content

   3.  Redirecting Requests

   4.  Billing/Settling

3.1 Peering Establishment and Termination Scenarios

   These items describe the scenarios that occur when CDNs are
   beginning or terminating some form of peering relationship.

   In each case, we assume that the peering relationship is being
   established between a BILLING ENTITY and a DISTRIBUTING CDN. The
   BILLING ENTITY already has a NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIP with the
   relevant PUBLISHER(s), and so is already prepared to transfer money
   in the appropriate direction, to the appropriate party. The
   DISTRIBUTING CDN does not have such a connection to the relevant
   PUBLISHER(s).

3.1.1 Peering Establishment

   These items describe the situations in which CDNs are beginning some
   form of peering.

   1.  BILLING ENTITY and DISTRIBUTING CDN agree to peer DISTRIBUTION
       SYSTEMs for all PUBLISHERS of the BILLING ENTITY.

   2.  BILLING ENTITY and DISTRIBUTING CDN agree to peer DISTRIBUTION
       SYSTEMs for some (specified) PUBLISHER(s) of the BILLING ENTITY.

   3.  BILLING ENTITY and REDIRECTION ENTITY agree to peer REDIRECTION
       SYSTEMs for all PUBLISHERS of the BILLING CDN.

   4.  BILLING ENTITY and REDIRECTION ENTITY agree to peer REDIRECTION
       SYSTEMs for some (specified) PUBLISHER(s) of the BILLING CDN.

3.1.2 Peering Termination

   These items describe the situations in which CDNs are terminating
   some or all content peering relationships.



Day & Gilletti           Expires March 27, 2001                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                   CDNPS                    September 2000


   1.  BILLING ENTITY ends DISTRIBUTION PEERING with specified
       DISTRIBUTING CDN.

   2.  BILLING EMTITY ends REDIRECTION PEERING with specified
       REDIRECTION ENTITY.

   3.  BILLING ENTITY ends all peering with specified CDN(s).

   4.  BILLING ENTITY ends all peering with all CDNs.

   5.  DISTRIBUTING CDN ends DISTRIBUTION PEERING with specified
       BILLING ENTITY.

   6.  REDIRECTING CDN ends REDIRECTION PEERING with specified BILLING
       ENTITY.

   7.  CDN ends all peering with specified BILLING ENTITY.

   8.  CDN ends all peering with all BILLING ENTITIES.

3.2 Distributing Content

   These items describe situations in which content is being placed in
   a CDN.  Again, these descriptions are written in terms of a BILLING
   ENTITY and a DISTRIBUTING CDN. We assume that any given CDN has its
   own mechanisms for distributing content efficiently to an
   appropriate set of SURROGATEs. The interactions in this situation
   can only take place after some form of DISTRIBUTION PEERING has been
   established, as described in the previous section. Interactions in
   this section must take account of the possibility that one of the
   parties may have terminated the peering relationship.

3.2.1 Content Is Valuable

   These items describe situations in which payment is expected to flow
   from the consumer of content back to the PUBLISHER via the BILLING
   CDN. Included in valuable-content scenarios are business models such
   as pay-per-view or subscriptions, but note that billing and
   settlement issues are treated in greater detail in [3].

   BILLING ENTITY initiates change in CONTENT distribution: 

      These items describe situations in which the BILLING ENTITY
      initiates some change in the distribution of one or more CONTENT
      objects. 

      1.  BILLING ENTITY provides new CONTENT for distribution.

      2.  BILLING ENTITY signals currently distributed CONTENT has

Internet-Draft                   CDNPS                    September 2000


          changed.

      3.  BILLING ENTITY withdraws CONTENT from distribution.


   BILLING ENTITY initiates change in CONTINUOUS MEDIA distribution: 

      These items describe situations in which the BILLING ENTITY
      initiates some change in the distribution of CONTINUOUS MEDIA. 

      1.  BILLING ENTITY provides new CONTINUOUS MEDIA for distribution.

      2.  BILLING ENTITY signals currently distributed CONTINUOUS MEDIA
          has changed.

      3.  BILLING ENTITY withdraws CONTINUOUS MEDIA from distribution.


   DISTRIBUTING CDN initiates change in CONTENT distribution: 

      These items describe situations in which the DISTRIBUTING CDN
      initiates some change in the distribution of CONTENT. 

      1.  DISTRIBUTING CDN requests new CONTENT for distribution.

      2.  DISTRIBUTION CDN drops CONTENT from distribution.


   DISTRIBUTING CDN initiates change in CONTINUOUS MEDIA distribution: 

      These items describe situations in which the DISTRIBUTING CDN
      initiates some change in the distribution of CONTINUOUS MEDIA. 

      1.  DISTRIBUTING CDN requests new CONTINUOUS MEDIA for
          distribution.

      2.  DISTRIBUTING CDN drops CONTINUOUS MEDIA from distribution.


3.2.2 Distribution is Valuable

   These items describe situations in which payment is expected to flow
   from the PUBLISHER to the DISTRIBUTING CDN via the BILLING ENTITY.
   These situations include most CDN revenue-sharing models, but note
   that billing and settlement issues are treated in additional detail
   in [3].

   BILLING ENTITY initiates change in CONTENT distribution: 



Day & Gilletti           Expires March 27, 2001                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                   CDNPS                    September 2000


      These items describe situations in which the BILLING ENTITY
      initiates some change in the distribution of CONTENT. 

      1.  BILLING ENTITY provides new CONTENT for distribution.

      2.  BILLING ENTITY signals currently distributed CONTENT has
          changed.


   BILLING ENTITY withdraws CONTENT from distribution: 

      These items descrive the situations where the BILLING ENTITY
      withdraws CONTENT from distribution. 


   BILLING ENTITY initiates change in CONTINUOUS MEDIA distribution: 

      These items describe situations in which the BILLING ENTITY
      initiates some change in the distribution of CONTINUOUS MEDIA. 

      1.  BILLING ENTITY provides new CONTINUOUS MEDIA for distribution.

      2.  BILLING ENTITY signals currently distributed CONTINUOUS MEDIA
          has changed.

      3.  BILLING ENTITY withdraws CONTINUOUS MEDIA from distribution.


   DISTRIBUTING CDN initiates change in CONTENT distribution: 

      These items describe situations in which the DISTRIBUTING CDN
      initiates some change in the distribution of CONTENT. 

      1.  DISTRIBUTING CDN requests new CONTENT for distribution.

      2.  DISTRIBUTING CDN drops CONTENT from distribution.


   DISTRIBUTING CDN initiates change in CONTINUOUS MEDIA distribution: 

      These items describe situations in which the DISTRIBUTING CDN
      initiates some change in the distribution of CONTINUOUS MEDIA. 

      1.  DISTRIBUTING CDN requests new CONTINUOUS MEDIA for
          distribution.

      2.  DISTRIBUTING CDN drops CONTINUOUS MEDIA from distribution.

3.3 Redirecting Requests

   These items describe situations in which a REQUEST may need to be
   redirected from the FIRST-REDIRECTION CDN to another CDN. The
   FIRST-REDIRECTION CDN is the network that receives the request and
   is able to redirect that request to a REMOTE CDN if appropriate.
   Depending on the redirection technology involved, there may be zero,
   one, or n redirections possible for a given REQUEST.

   1.  REQUEST is for CONTENT on the FIRST-REDIRECTION CDN

   2.  REQUEST is for CONTENT available from a single REMOTE CDN

   3.  REQUEST is for CONTENT available from multiple REMOTE CDNs

   4.  REQUEST is for CONTENT available on both the FIRST-REDIRECTION
       CDN and a single REMOTE CDN

   5.  REQUEST is for CONTENT available on both the FIRST-REDIRECTION
       CDN and multiple REMOTE CDNs

   6.  REQUEST is for CONTENT available on both the FIRST-REDIRECTION
       CDN and a single REMOTE CDN, but the REMOTE CDN performance is
       better.

3.4 Billing and Settling

   This section enumerates some of the scenarios which result from
   considering the concepts given in [3].

   1.  CONTENT is valuable and delivered by a CDN which is also the
       BILLING ENTITY.

   2.  CONTENT is valuable and delivered by another CDN that has a
       NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIP with the BILLING ENTITY.

   3.  CONTENT is valuable and delivered by another network.  The
       BILLING ENTITY and other CDN each have a NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIP
       with a clearinghouse but have no direct relationship with each
       other.

   4.  DISTRIBUTION is valuable and performed by a CDN which is also
       the BILLING ENTITY.

   5.  DISTRIBUTION is valuable and performed by another CDN that has a
       NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIP with the BILLING ENTITY.

   6.  DISTRIBUTION is valuable and performed by another CDN. The
       BILLING ENTITY and other CDN each have a NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIP

4. Security Considerations

   This document describes scenarios for use in evaluating CDN peering
   proposals. As such, it does not propose any solutions which might
   have security concerns.

   This docment assumes that any peering solutions which are derived
   within the context of Content Alliance effort will be compliant with
   the trust model given in [4].
