INTERNET-DRAFT                  ISDN MIB                    October 1995


1.  Introduction

This draft defines an experimental portion of the Management Information
Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
community.  In particular, it defines a minimal set of managed objects
for SNMP-based management of ISDN interfaces. ISDN interfaces are
supported on a variety of equipment (for data and voice) including
terminal adapters, bridges, hosts, and routers. The set of objects will
be consistent with the SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards.

This document is a product of the ISDN MIB working group within the
Internet Engineering Task Force.  Comments are solicited and should be
addressed to the working group's mailing list at isdn-mib@combinet.com
and/or the author.

2.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major
components.  They are:

o    RFC 1442 [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
     describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

o    STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] defines MIB-II, the core set of managed
     objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

o    RFC 1445 [3] which defines the administrative and other
     architectural aspects of the framework.

o    RFC 1448 [4] which defines the protocol used for network access to
     managed objects.

The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
experimentation and evaluation.


2.1.  Object Definitions

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are defined
using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the
SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
an administratively assigned name.  The object type together with an
object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of
the object.  For human convenience, we often use a textual string,
termed the descriptor, to refer to the object type.

3.  Overview

3.1.  Structure of MIB

For managing ISDN interfaces, the following information is necessary:

o    Information for managing physical interfaces. In case of ISDN
     primary rate, this will usually be T1 or E1 lines, being managed in
     the Trunk MIB. For Basic Rate lines, physical interfaces will be
     managed by this MIB.

o    Information for managing signalling channels, usually referred to
     as D channels.

o    Information for managing bearer channels, usually referred to as B
     channels.

Within this document, this information has been structured into three
groups, which will be described in the following chapters.

In order to manage connections over ISDN lines, the management of
neighbors and call history information is required as well.  This
information will be defined in the Dial Control MIB.

The purpose for splitting the required information in two MIBs is to be
able to use parts of this information for non-ISDN interfaces as well.
In particular, the Dial Control MIB might also be used for other types
of interfaces.


3.1.1.  General Description

This MIB controls signalling channels as well as B channels and physical
Basic Rate interfaces.  It consists of three groups.

o    The isdnMibBasicRateGroup is used to provide information regarding
     physical Basic Rate interfaces.

o    The isdnMibSignallingGroup is used to control ISDN signalling
     channels.  It consists of two tables, the isdnSignallingTable for
     configuration information and the isdnSignallingStatsTable for
     statistics information.

o    The isdnBearerGroup is used to control bearer channels, usually
     referred to as B channels. It supports configuration parameters as

INTERNET-DRAFT                  ISDN MIB                    October 1995


     well as statistical information related to B channels.


3.2.  Relationship to RFC 1573

RFC 1573, the Interface MIB Evolution, requires that any MIB module
which is an adjunct of the Interface MIB, clarify specific areas within
the Interface MIB.  These areas were intentionally left vague in RFC
1573 to avoid over constraining the MIB module, thereby precluding
management of certain media-types.

Section 3.3 of RFC 1573 enumerates several areas which a media-specific
MIB module must clarify.  Each of these areas is addressed in a
following subsection.  The implementor is referred to RFC 1573 in order
to understand the general intent of these areas.


3.2.1.  Layering Model

An ISDN interface usually consists of a signalling channel (D channel)
and a number of bearer channels (B channels), all of which will be
layered on top of a physical interface.

This is accomplished in this MIB by creating a logical interface
(ifEntry) for each of the D channels and a logical interface (ifEntry)
for each of the B channels. These are then correlated to each other and
to the physical interface using the ifStack table of RFC 1573.

INTERNET-DRAFT                  ISDN MIB                    October 1995


The basic model, therefore, looks something like this:


       | |        | |            | |    <== interface to upper
    +--+ +--+  +--+ +--+      +--+ +--+     layers, to be handled
    |   D   |  |   B   |      |   B   |     by Dial Control MIB

       | |        | |            | |    <== attachment to physical
    +--+ +--------+ +------------+ +----+   interfaces, to be provided
    |         physical interface        |   by ifStack table
    |          (S0/Uk0 or T1/E1)        |
    +-----------------------------------+

Mapping of B/D channels to physical interfaces

IfEntries are maintained for D channels and for each B channel. The D
channel's interface ifType is one of the ISDN interface types; the B
channel ifType is isdn(63). The ifType for physical interfaces is the
matching IANA ifType, usually T1 or E1 for physical Primary Rate
interfaces and >>to be assigned<< for physical Basic Rate interfaces.

The ifStackTable is used to map B and D channels to physical interfaces.
Conceivably, X.25 or Frame Relay interface MIBs could then be layered on
the D channel.

Mapping of B channels to upper interface layers will usually be done
using the Dial Control MIB. For example, mapping on top of B channels
might look as follows:

3.3.  ISDN interface specific information

3.3.1.  ISDN leased lines

ISDN leased lines on Basic Rate interfaces can be specified by setting
the value of isdnBasicTblConnectionType to one of the leased line types.
There will be no signalling table entry for leased lines, since there is
no signalling channel available.  Thus, only B channel interfaces will
exist in this case.

For Primary Rate interfaces, a leased line does not have any ISDN
specifics. Therefore, Primary Rate leased lines will entirely be handled
by the according MIB for this kind of interfaces, i.e. the Trunk MIB for
E1/T1 interfaces.  No ISDN ifEntries will exist in this case.


3.3.2.  Hyperchannels

The switch protocol in use will define if hyperchannels are being
supported, and the actual support will be implementation dependent.
Hyperchannel connections itself will be requested by the interface user,
e.g. by the neighbor connection handling procedures.

In the ISDN MIB, the isdnBearerStatsMultirate object of
isdnBearerStatsTable can be used to check if hyperchannels are being
used for an active call.


3.3.3.  D channel backup and NFAS trunks

D channel backup is defined in [5], Annex F.  It describes non-
associated signalling and its use and functionality is basically
identical to NFAS trunks.

Non Facility Accociated Signalling (NFAS) basically means that a D
channel on a PRI interface is used to manage calls on other PRI trunks.
This is required in North America for H11 channels, since all 24 time
slots are being used for bearer channels.

According to [5], Annex F, the D channel backup feature can be provided
on a subscription basis and is network dependent.  The D channel backup
procedure is described in detail in [5].

In case of D channel backup or NFAS trunks, the isdnSigTblPhysInterface
object defines the physical interface the D channel resides on. Using

the ifStack table, the active D channel is layered on top of all
physical interfaces being managed by this D channel.

In case of D channel backup, inactive D channels will have an
operational status of dormant(5).


3.3.4.  X.25 data transfer in D channel

Transfer of X.25 data over D channels can be handled by attaching an
X.25 interface to a D channel using the ifStack table of RFC 1573.


3.3.5.  SPID handling

Service Profile IDentifiers (SPID) are defined for BRI interfaces only,
and being used in North America. SPIDs are required for DMS-100 and NI-
1, and are optional for 5ESS. A switch can define up to 8 SPIDs per BRI.

Usually, each B channel has one SPID assigned. It is normally built from
the party number (calling address for outgoing calls) with a number of
digits prepended and appended. Since each network appears to be
different, both the calling address and the SPID have to be stored.

The SPID identifies the particular services that have been provisioned
for a terminal. If there are two B channels on a BRI, there can be two
SPIDs, one for each of the two B channels.

The SPID gets registered with the switch after link establishment.
There is one data link for each SPID. As part of terminal registration,
an EID (Endpoint IDentifier) is defined by the switch.  On incoming
calls, the switch may provide the EID, a called party number, or both,
depending on the ISDN code implemented in the switch.

The EID has two bytes: USID (User Service IDentifier) and TID (Terminal
IDentifier). These are later used by some of the software versions
running on the switch side (e.g. compliant with NI-1, 5ESS custom) to
broadcast SETUP messages with these included, so the correct endpoint
would accept the call. Other switch software versions identify the
endpoint with the Called Party Number.

In the ISDN MIB, the SPID can be entered using the isdnBearerIfSpid
object of isdnBearerTable. The isdnBearerCallingAddress, already being
used to specify the calling number, cannot be used for this purpose,
since both may differ and be required in parallel.

3.3.6.  Closed User Groups

Closed User Groups (CUG), as defined in [5], chapter 4.6.1, are being
supported for circuit mode calls at least by ETSI and 1TR6.  In this
networks, an ISDN address can have one or more CUG numbers assigned.  To
such addresses, only calls from attached Closed User Groups will be
accepted by the network.

Thus, Closed User Groups are a parameter for neighbor entries and will
thus be defined in the Dial Control MIB. A neighbor entry attached to a
Closed User Group will have to point to an ISDN interface which belongs
to the Closed User group in question.


3.3.7.  Provision of point-to-point line topology

In the ISDN standards, there are two different meanings for the term
"point-to-point".

In ISDN standards, the term point-to-point will usually be used for data
link connections, i.e. layer 2 connections, where each layer 2
connection from the TE to the network is a single point-to-point
connection.  Multiple connections of this kind may exist on one physical
(layer 1) connection, however, and in case of Basic Rate interfaces
there may be several TE's connected to one physical line to the network.

The second meaning of "point-to-point" refers to the line topology, i.e.
to layer 1 connections.  For Primary Rate interfaces, the layer 1
connection will always be of the point-to-point type.  For Basic Rate
interfaces, layer 1 point-to-point connections do exist in several
countries, usually being used for connecting PBX systems to the network.

The second meaning (layer 1 connections) is what will be referred to as
"point-to-point" connection throughout this document.

The isdnSignallingTable object isdnSigTblLineTopology can be used to
select the line topology. In case of Primary Rate interfaces, this
object will always have a value of pointToPoint(1).


3.3.8.  Speech and audio bearer capability information elements

The objects speech(1), audio_31() and audio_7(), as being used in
isdnBearerStatsInfoType, refer to the Speech, 3.1 kHz Audio and old 7
kHz Audio (now Multi-use) bearer capabilities for ISDN, as defined in

[5], chapter 4.5.5, octet 3 of bearer capability information element.

These capabilities are signaling artifices that allow networks to do
certain things with the call.  It is up to the network to decide what to
do.

The Speech Bearer Capability means that speech is being carried over the
channel, as in two people talking.  This would be POTS-type speech.  The
network may compress this, encrypt it or whatever it wants with it as
long as it delivers POTS quality speech to the other end.  In other
words, a modem is not guaranteed to work over this connection.

The 3.1 kHz Audio capability indicates that the network carries the 3.1
kHz bandwidth across the network.  This would (theoretically) allow
modem signals to be carried across the network.  In the US, the network
automatically enters a capability of 3.1 kHz Audio on calls coming into
the ISDN from a POTS network.  This capability restricts the network
from messing with the data channel in a way that would corrupt the 3.1
kHz VoiceBand data.

7 kHz Audio was meant to signal the use of a higher quality audio
connection (e.g., music from radio).  It got changed to Multi-Use
capability to allow it to be used for videoconferencing with fall back
to audio or something like that.

In some cases, the Speech or 3.1 kHz Bearer Capability provides a 56
kbit/s data path through the network.  Therefore, some people are
setting up calls with the Speech or 3.1 kHz BC and transmitting 56
kbit/s data over the connection.  This is usually to take advantage of
favorable tariffs for Speech as opposed to Data.

On the incoming side, the equipment is usually configured to ignore the
Bearer Capability and either answer all Speech calls as 56 kbit/s data
or to use one Directory Number for real speech and another for data.
