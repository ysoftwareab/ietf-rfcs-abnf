Internet-Draft      The GCM Mode of Camellia in IPsec      February 2007


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the use of the Camellia block cipher
   algorithm in GCM Mode (Camellia-GCM), as an IPsec ESP mechanism to
   provide confidentiality, and data origin authentication.  We refer to
   this method as Camellia-GCM-ESP.

   Camellia is a symmetric cipher with a Feistel structure.  Camellia
   was developed jointly by NTT and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation in
   2000.  It was designed to withstand all known cryptanalytic attacks,
   and it has been scrutinized by worldwide cryptographic experts.
   Camellia is suitable for implementation in software and hardware,
   offering encryption speed in software and hardware implementations
   that is comparable to Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [15].

   Camellia supports 128-bit block size and 128-, 192-, and 256-bit key
   lengths, i.e., the same interface specifications as the AES.
   Therefore it is easy to implement Camellia-GCM by replacing AES block
   of AES-GCM [1] to Camellia.

   Camellia is adopted as IETF and several international standardization
   organizations.  Camellia is already adopted as IPSec [8], TLS [12],
   S/MIME [10] and XML [11].  Camellia is adopted for the one of three
   ISO/IEC international standard cipher [18] as 128bit block
   cipher(Camellia AES and SEED).  Camellia was selected as a
   recommended cryptographic primitive by the EU NESSIE (New European
   Schemes for Signatures, Integrity and Encryption) project [16] and
   was included in the list of cryptographic techniques for Japanese
   e-Government systems that was selected by the Japan CRYPTREC
   (Cryptography Research and Evaluation Committees) [17].

   Since optimized source code is provided by several open source
   lisences [19], Camellia is also adopted by several open source
   projects.  Camellia is already adopted by Openssl.  Additional API
   for Network Security Services (NSS) and IPsec stack of Linux and Free
   BSD are prepared or working progress for release.

   The algorithm specification and object identifiers are described in
   [5].  The Camellia homepage [20] contains a wealth of information
   about Camellia, including detailed specification, security analysis,
   performance figures, reference implementation, optimized
   implementetion, test vectors, and intellectual property information.

   GCM mode provides Counter mode (CTR) with data origin authentication.
   This document does not cover implementation details of GCM.  Those
   details can be found in [1].

2.  Camelllia-GCM

   GCM is a block cipher mode of operation providing both
   confidentiality and data origin authentication.  The GCM
   authenticated encryption operation has four inputs: a secret key, an
   initialization vector (IV), a plaintext, and an input for additional
   authenticated data (AAD).  It has two outputs, a ciphertext whose
   length is identical to the plaintext, and an authentication tag.  In
   the following, we describe how the IV, plaintext, and AAD are formed
   from the ESP fields, and how the ESP packet is formed from the
   ciphertext and authentication tag.

   ESP also defines an IV.  For clarity, we refer to the Camellia-GCM IV
   as a nonce in the context of Camellia-GCM-ESP.  The same nonce and
   key combination MUST NOT be used more than once.

   Because reusing an nonce/key combination destroys the security
   guarantees of Camellia-GCM mode, it can be difficult to use this mode
   securely when using statically configured keys.  For safety's sake,
   implementations MUST use an automated key management system, such as
   the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) [9], to ensure that this requirement
   is met.

3.  ESP Payload Data

   The ESP Payload Data is comprised of an eight-octet initialization
   vector (IV), followed by the ciphertext.  The payload field, as
   defined in [7], is structured as shown in Figure 1, along with the
   ICV associated with the payload.

       0                   1                   2                   3

      ~                       Ciphertext (variable)                   ~
      |                                                               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

            Figure 1: ESP Payload Encrypted with Camellia-GCM.

3.1.  Initialization Vector (IV)

   The Camellia-GCM-ESP IV field MUST be eight octets.  For a given key,
   the IV MUST NOT repeat.  The most natural way to implement this is
   with a counter, but anything that guarantees uniqueness can be used,
   such as a linear feedback shift register (LFSR).  Note that the
   encrypter can use any IV generation method that meets the uniqueness
   requirement, without coordinating with the decrypter.

3.2.  Ciphertext

   The plaintext input to Camellia-GCM is formed by concatenating the
   plaintext data described by the Next Header field with the Padding,
   the Pad Length, and the Next Header field.  The Ciphertext field
   consists of the ciphertext output from the Camellia-GCM algorithm.
   The length of the ciphertext is identical to that of the plaintext.

   Implementations that do not seek to hide the length of the plaintext
   SHOULD use the minimum amount of padding required, which will be less
   than four octets.

4.  Nonce Format

   The nonce passed to the Camellia-GCM encryption algorithm has the
   following layout:

       0                   1                   2                   3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                             Salt                              |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                     Initialization Vector                     |
      |                                                               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                               Nonce Format

   The components of the nonce are as follows:

   salt
      The salt field is a four-octet value that is assigned at the
      beginning of the security association, and then remains constant
      for the life of the security association.  The salt SHOULD be
      unpredictable (i.e., chosen at random) before it is selected, but
      need not be secret.  We describe how to set the salt for a
      Security Association established via the Internet Key Exchange in
      Section Section 8.1.

   Initialization Vector
      The IV field is described in Section Section 3.1

5.  AAD Construction

   The authentication of data integrity and data origin for the SPI and
   (Extended) Sequence Number fields is provided without encryption.
   This is done by including those fields in the Camellia-GCM Additional
   Authenticated Data (AAD) field.  Two formats of the AAD are defined:
   one for 32-bit sequence numbers, and one for 64-bit extended sequence
   numbers.  The format with 32-bit sequence numbers is shown in
   Figure 3 , and the format with 64-bit extended sequence numbers is
   shown in Figure 4 .

       0                   1                   2                   3

6.  Integrity Check Value (ICV)

   The ICV consists solely of the Camellia-GCM Authentication Tag.
   Implementations MUST support a full-length 16-octet ICV, and MAY
   support 8 or 12 octet ICVs, and MUST NOT support other ICV lengths.
   Although ESP does not require that an ICV be present, Camellia-GCM-
   ESP intentionally does not allow a zero-length ICV.  This is because
   GCM provides no integrity protection whatsoever when used with a
   zero-length Authentication Tag.

7.  Packet Expansion

   The IV adds an additional eight octets to the packet, and the ICV
   adds an additional 8, 12, or 16 octets.  These are the only sources
   of packet expansion, other than the 10-13 octets taken up by the ESP
   SPI, Sequence Number, Padding, Pad Length, and Next Header fields (if
   the minimal amount of padding is used).

8.  IKE Conventions

   This section describes the conventions used to generate keying
   material and salt values, for use with Camellia-GCM-ESP, using the
   Internet Key Exchange (IKE) [9] protocol.  The identifiers and
   attributes needed to negotiate a security association using Camellia-
   GCM-ESP are also defined.

8.1.   Keying Material and Salt Values

   IKE makes use of a pseudo-random function (PRF) to derive keying
   material.  The PRF is used iteratively to derive keying material of
   arbitrary size, called KEYMAT.  Keying material is extracted from the
   output string without regard to boundaries.

   The size of the KEYMAT for the Camellia-GCM-ESP MUST be four octets
   longer than is needed for the associated Camellia key.  The keying
   material is used as follows:

   Camellia-GCM-ESP with a 128 bit key
      The KEYMAT requested for each Camellia-GCM key is 20 octets.  The
      first 16 octets are the 128-bit Camellia key, and the remaining
      four octets are used as the salt value in the nonce.

    Camellia-GCM-ESP with a 192 bit key
      The KEYMAT requested for each Camellia-GCM key is 28 octets.  The
      first 24 octets are the 192-bit Camellia key, and the remaining
      four octets are used as the salt value in the nonce.

   Camellia-GCM-ESP with a 256 bit key
      The KEYMAT requested for each Camellia GCM key is 36 octets.  The
      first 32 octets are the 256-bit Camellia key, and the remaining
      four octets are used as the salt value in the nonce.

8.2.  Phase 1 Identifier

   This document does not specify the conventions for using Camellia-GCM
   for IKE Phase 1 negotiations.  For Camellia-GCM to be used in this
   manner, a separate specification is needed, and an Encryption
   Algorithm Identifier needs to be assigned.  Implementations SHOULD
   use an IKE Phase 1 cipher that is at least as strong as Camellia-GCM.
   The use of Camellia CBC [8] with the same key size used by Camellia-
   GCM-ESP is RECOMMENDED.

8.3.  Phase 2 Identifier

   For IKE Phase 2 negotiations, IANA has assigned three ESP Transform
   Identifiers for Camellia-GCM with an eight-byte explicit IV:

         <TBD1> for Camellia-GCM with an 8 octet ICV;
         <TBD2> for Camellia-GCM with a 12 octet ICV; and
         <TBD3> for Camellia-GCM with a 16 octet ICV.

8.4.  Key Length Attribute

   Because the Camellia supports three key lengths, the Key Length
   attribute MUST be specified in the IKE Phase 2 exchange [3].  The Key
   Length attribute MUST have a value of 128, 192, or 256.

   Camellia.  And no security problem has been found on Camellia [16],
