Introduction   The purpose of this memo is to document how the requirements for   advancing a routing protocol from Draft Standard to full Standard   have been satisfied by Border Gateway Protocol version 4 (BGP-4).   This report satisfies the requirement for "the second report", as   described in Section 6.0 of RFC 1264.  In order to fulfill the   requirement, this report augments RFC 1773 and describes additional   knowledge and understanding gained in the time between when the   protocol was made a Draft Standard and when it was submitted for   Standard.2.  BGP-4 Overview   BGP is an inter-autonomous system routing protocol designed for   TCP/IP internets.  The primary function of BGP is to exchange network   reachability information with other BGP systems.  This information is   sufficient to construct a graph of loop-free AS connectivity and some   policy decisions at the AS level may be enforced.   The initial version of the BGP protocol was published in RFC 1105.   Since then BGP Versions 2, 3, and 4 have been developed and are   specified in [RFC 1163], [RFC 1267], and [RFC 1771], respectively.   Changes since BGP-4 went to Draft Standard [RFC 1771] are listed in   Appendix N of [BGP4].2.1.  A Border Gateway Protocol   BGP [RFC 1105]   Appendix D of [BGP4] Comparison with 1105:    o Changes to FSM to accommdate BSD 4.3 TCP UI.    o Notion of Up/Down/Horizontal relations have been removed.    o Message format changes:      - Hold Timer removed from BGP Header and added to OPEN Message      - Version field removed from BGP Header and added to OPEN Message      - Link Type field removed from OPEN Message      - OPEN CONFIRM message deprecated and replaced with implicit        confirmation provided by KEEPALIVE message.McPherson and Patel                               Section 2.1.  [Page 4]INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: October 2003               April 2003      - UPDATE Message format changed.  New fields were added to        support multiple path attributes.      - The Marker field was expanded and its role broadened to        support authentication2.2.  BGP version 2   BGPv2 [RFC 1163]   Appendix C of [BGP4] Comparison with RFC 1163    o BGP Identifier introduced to deal with collision detection.    o Removed restriction that border router of NEXT_HOP path attribute      had to be part of same AS.    o Optimized and simplified exchange of information about reachable      routes.   BGP version 2 removed from the protocol the concept of "up", "down",   and "horizontal" relations between autonomous systems that were   present in version 1.  BGP version 2 introduced the concept of path   attributes.  In addition, BGP version 2 clarified parts of the   protocol that were "under-specified".2.3.  BGP version 3   BGPv3 [RFC 1267]   Appendix B of [BGP4] Comparison with RFC 1267:    o Set of destination via single IP prefix.  Concept of      network classes, or subnetting is foreign to BGP-4.      To accommodate these capabilities BGP-4 changes the      semantics and encoding associated with the AS_PATH attribute.      New text has been added to define semantics associated with      IP Prefixes.  These abilities allow BGP to support the      proposed supernetting scheme [RFC 1518] (BGP4 Draft reference      to [9] needs to be fixed).    o LOCAL_PREF intrduced to facilitate route selection procedures.    o INTER_AS_METRIC renamed to MULTI_EXIT_DISC    o ATOMIC_AGGREGATE introduced to ensure that certain aggregates      are not deaggregated.    o Introduced AGGREGATOR.McPherson and Patel                               Section 2.3.  [Page 5]INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: October 2003               April 2003    o Holdtimer neogtiation per-connection for symmetry.  Lower value      used.  Hold Times of zero now supported.   BGP version 3 lifted some of the restrictions on the use of the   NEXT_HOP path attribute, and added the BGP Identifier field to the   BGP OPEN message.  It also clarifies the procedure for distributing   BGP routes between the BGP speakers within an autonomous system.2.4.  BGP version 4   BGP v4 [RFC 1771] [BGP4]   Appendix A of [BGP4] Comparison with RFC 1771:    o Changes to reflect use of the TCP MD5 Signature Option,      Route Reflectors, AS Confederations for BGP and BGP Route      Refresh.    o Clarified use of BGP Identifier in AGGREGATOR Attribute    o Procedures for imposing upper bound of prefixes a speaker will      accept from a peer.    o Ability to include more than one instance of it's own AS in the      AS_PATH attribute for the purpose of inter-AS traffic engineering.    o Clarified various types of NEXT_HOPS    o Claried use of ATOMIC_AGGREGATE attribute    o Discussed relationship be BGP NEXT_HOP attribute and immediate      next hop.    o Clarified tie-breaking procedures    o Clarified route advertisement frequency text.    o Deprecated Optional Parameter Type 1 (Authentication Information)    o UPDATE Message Error subcode 7 (AS Routing Loop) deprecated.    o Use of Marker field for authentication has been deprecated.   BGP version 4 redefines the (previously defined class-based) network   layer reachability portion of the updates to specify prefixes of   arbitrary length in order to represent multiple classful networks in   a single entry as discussed in [RFC 1519].  BGP version 4 has also   modified the AS_PATH attribute so that sets of autonomous systems, as   well as individual ASs may be described.  BGP version 4 has   redescribed the INTER-AS METRIC attribute as the MULTI_EXIT_DISC and   added new LOCAL_PREF and AGGREGATOR attributes.   BGP version 4 defines procedures for imposing an upper bound on the   number of prefixes that a BGP speaker may accept from its peer. BGP   version 4 has modifed the AS_PATH attribute to have an ability toMcPherson and Patel                               Section 2.4.  [Page 6]INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: October 2003               April 2003   include more than one instance of its own AS for the purpose of   inter-AS traffic engineering.   BGP version 4 deprecates the use of OPTIONAL PARAMETER Type 1   (Authentication Information). BGP version 4 also depecates the use of   UPDATE MESSAGE Error subcode 7 (AS Routing Loop).   BGP version 4 provides clarifications on use of BGP Identifier in the   AGGREGATOR attribute and use of the ATOMIC_AGGREGATOR attribute.  BGP   version 4 also provides clarifications on various types of NEXT_HOPs,   BGP tie-breaking procedures and frequency of route announcements in   BGP.   Possible applications of BGP in the Internet are documented in [RFC   1772].   The BGP protocol was developed by the IDR Working Group of the   Internet Engineering Task Force. This Working Group had a mailing   list, idr@merit.edu, where discussions of protocol features and   operation are held. The IDR Working Group meets regularly during the   Internet Engineering Task Force meetings.  Reports of these meetings   are published in the IETF's Proceedings.3.  Management Information Base (MIB)   The BGP-4 Management Information Base (MIB) has been published [BGP-   MIB].  The MIB was updated from previous versions documented in [RFC   1657] and [RFC 1269], respectively.   Apart from a few system variables, the BGP MIB is broken into two   tables: the BGP Peer Table and the BGP Received Path Attribute Table.   The Peer Table reflects information about BGP peer connections, such   as their state and current activity. The Received Path Attribute   Table contains all attributes received from all peers before local   routing policy has been applied. The actual attributes used in   determining a route are a subset of the received attribute table.4.  Implementations   There are numerous independent interoperable implementations of BGPMcPherson and Patel                                 Section 4.  [Page 7]INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: October 2003               April 2003   currently available.  Although the previous version of this report   provided an overview of the implementations currently used in the   operational Internet, at this time it has been suggested that a   separate BGP Implementation Report [BGP-IMPL] be generated.   It should be noted that implementation experience with Cisco's BGP-4   implementation was documented as part of [RFC 1656].   For all additional implementation information please reference [BGP-   IMPL].5.  Operational Experience   This section discusses operational experience with BGP and BGP-4.   BGP has been used in the production environment since 1989, BGP-4   since 1993.  Production use of BGP includes utilization of all   significant features of the protocol.  The present production   environment, where BGP is used as the inter-autonomous system routing   protocol, is highly heterogeneous.  In terms of the link bandwidth it   varies from 64 Kbs to 10 Gbs.  In terms of the actual routes that run   BGP it ranges from a relatively slow performance PC/RT to a very high   performance RISC-based CPUs, and includes both the special purpose   routers and the general purpose workstations running various UNIX   derivatives and other operating systems.   In terms of the actual topologies it varies from a very sparse to   quite dense.  Full-mesh IBGP topologies have been largely mitigated   by BGP Route Reflection [RFC 2796], Autonomous System Confederations   for BGP [RFC 3065], or some combination of the two, in many networks.   At the time of this writing BGP-4 is used as an inter-autonomous   system routing protocol between ALL Internet-attached autonomous   systems, with nearly 15k active autonomous systems in the global   Internet routing table.   BGP is used both for the exchange of routing information between a   transit and a stub autonomous system, and for the exchange of routing   information between multiple transit autonomous systems.  There is no   protocol distinction between sites historically considered   "backbones" versus "regional" networks.   Within transit networks, BGP is typically used as the exclusive   carrier of exterior routing information.McPherson and Patel                                 Section 5.  [Page 8]INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: October 2003               April 2003   The full set of exterior routes that is carried by BGP is well over   115,000 aggregate entries, representing several times that number of   connected networks.  The number of active paths in some service   provider core routers has exceeded 2 million.  Native AS_PATH lengths   are as long as 10 for some routes, and "padded" path lengths of 25 or   more ASs exist.6.  Metrics   This section discusses different metrics used within the BGP   protocol. BGP has a seperate metric parameter for IBGP and EBGP. This   allows policy based metrics to overwrite the distance based metrics;   allowing each autonomous systems to define their independent policies   in Intra-AS as well as Inter-AS. BGP Multi Exit Discriminator (MED)   is used as a metric by EBGP peers while BGP Local Preference is used   by IBGP peers.6.1.  MULTI_EXIT_DISC (MED)   BGP version 4 re-defined the old INTER-AS metric as a MULTI_EXIT_   DISC (MED).  This value may be used in the tie-breaking process when   selecting a preferred path to a given address space, and provides BGP   speakers with the capability to convey to a peer AS the optimal entry   point into the local AS.   Although the MED was meant to only be used when comparing paths   received from different external peers in the same AS, many   implementations provide the capability to compare MEDs between   different ASs as well.   The MED was purposely designed to be a "weak" metric that would only   be used late in the best-path decision process.  The BGP working   group was concerned that any metric specified by a remote operator   would only affect routing in a local AS if no other preference was   specified.  A paramount goal of the design of the MED was ensure that   peers could not "shed" or "absorb" traffic for networks that they   advertise.McPherson and Patel                               Section 6.1.  [Page 9]INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: October 2003               April 20036.1.1.  Sending MEDs to BGP Peers   [BGP4] allows MEDs received from any EBGP peers by a BGP speaker to   be passed to its IBGP peers.  Although advertising MEDs to IBGP peers   is not a required behavior, it is a common default. MEDs received   from EBGP peers by a BGP speaker MUST NOT be sent to other EBGP   peers.6.1.2.  MED of Zero Versus No MED   An implementation MUST provide a mechanism that allows for MED to be   removed.  Previously, implementations did not consider a missing MED   value to be the same as a MED of zero.  No MED value should now be   equal to a value of zero.6.1.3.  MEDs and Temporal Route Selection   Some implementations have hooks to apply temporal behavior in MED-   based best path selection.  That is, all other things being equal up   to MED consideration, preference would be applied to the "oldest"   path, without preferring the lower MED value.  The reasoning for this   is that "older" paths are presumably more stable, and thus more   preferable.  However, temporal behavior in route slection results in   non-deterministic behavior, and as such, is often undesirable.7.  LOCAL_PREF   The LOCAL_PREF attribute was added so a network operator could easily   configure a policy that overrode the standard best path determination   mechanism without independently configuring local preference policy   on each router.   One shortcoming in the BGP-4 specification was a suggestion for a   default value of LOCAL-PREF to be assumed if none was provided.   Defaults of 0 or the maximum value each have range limitations, so a   common default would aid in the interoperation of multi-vendor   routers in the same AS (since LOCAL_PREF is a local administration   knob, there is no interoperability drawback across AS boundaries).McPherson and Patel                                Section 7.  [Page 10]INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: October 2003               April 2003   LOCAL_PREF MUST be sent to IBGP Peers.   LOCAL_PREF Attribute MUST NOT be sent to EBGP Peers. (Handling   errors)  Spec says Notification with Error Code UPDATE Message Error.   The common default value for LOCAL_PREF is 100.  No default value is   defined.   Another area where more exploration is required is a method whereby   an originating AS may influence the best path selection process.  For   example, a dual-connected site may select one AS as a primary transit   service provider and have one as a backup.                    /---- transit B ----/\n        end-customer                     transit A----                   /---- transit C ----/   In a topology where the two transit service providers connect to a   third provider,  the real decision is performed by the third provider   and there is no mechanism for indicating a preference should the   third provider wish to respect that preference.   A general purpose suggestion that has been brought up is the   possibility of carrying an optional vector corresponding to the AS-   PATH where each transit AS may indicate a preference value for a   given route.  Cooperating ASs may then chose traffic based upon   comparison of "interesting" portions of this vector according to   routing policy.   While protecting a given ASs routing policy is of paramount concern,   avoiding extensive hand configuration of routing policies needs to be   examined more carefully in future BGP-like protocols.8.  Internal BGP In Large Autonomous Systems   While not strictly a protocol issue, one other concern has been   raised by network operators who need to maintain autonomous systems   with a large number of peers.  Each speaker peering with an external   router is responsible for propagating reachability and path   information to all other transit and border routers within that AS.   This is typically done by establishing internal BGP connections to   all transit and border routers in the local AS.McPherson and Patel                                Section 8.  [Page 11]INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: October 2003               April 2003   In a large AS, this leads to a full mesh of TCP connections (n *   (n-1)) and some method of configuring and maintaining those   connections.  BGP does not specify how this information is to be   propagated,  so alternatives, such as injecting BGP attribute   information into the local IGP have been suggested.  Also, there is   effort underway to develop internal BGP "route reflectors" or a   reliable multicast transport of IBGP information which would reduce   configuration, memory and CPU requirements of conveying information   to all other internal BGP peers.   BGP "Route Reflector" extensions has been defined in RFC 1966 to   alleviate the the need for "full mesh" IBGP.9.  Internet Dynamics   As discussed in [BGP4-ANALYSIS], the driving force in CPU and   bandwidth utilization is the dynamic nature of routing in the   Internet.  As the net has grown, the number of route changes per   second has increased.   We automatically get some level of damping when more specific NLRI is   aggregated into larger blocks, however this isn't sufficient.  In   Appendix F of [BGP4] are descriptions of damping techniques that   should be applied to advertisements.  In future specifications of   BGP-like protocols,  damping methods should be considered for   mandatory inclusion in compliant implementations.   Route changes are announced using BGP UPDATE messages. The greatest   overhead in advertising UPDATE messages happens whenever route   changes to be announced are inefficiently packed.Announcing routing   changes sharing common attributes in a single BGP UPDATE message   [13.1] also helps save considerable bandwidth.   Persistent BGP errors may cause BGP peers to flap persistently if   peer dampening is not implemented. This would result in significant   CPU utilization. Implementors may find it useful to implement peer   dampening to avoid such persistent  peer flapping [BGP4].10.  BGP Routing Information Bases (RIBs)   [BGP4] states "Any local policy which results in routes being added   to an Adj-RIB-Out without also being added to the local BGP speaker'sMcPherson and Patel                               Section 10.  [Page 12]INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: October 2003               April 2003   forwarding table, is outside the scope of this document".   However, several well-known implementations do not confirm that Loc-   RIB entries were used to populate the forwarding table before   installing them in the Adj-RIB-Out.  The most common occurrence of   this is when routes for a given prefix are presented by more than one   protocol and the preferences for the BGP learned route is lower than   that of another protocol.  As such, the route learned via the other   protocol is used to populate the forwarding table.   It may be desirable for an implementation to provide a knob that   permits advertisement of "inactive" BGP routes.   It may be also desirable for an implementation to provide a knob that   allows a BGP speaker to advertise BGP routes that were not selected   by descision process.11.  Update Packing   The BGP4 protocol permits advertisement of multiple prefixes with a   common set of path attributes to be advertised in a single update   message.  When possible, Update packing is recommended as it reduces   overhead in receivers in terms of:    o System overhead due to receipt of fewer Update messages.    o Overhead for scanning the routing table for BGP Updates to      its peers and other routing protocols (and the      redistribution of this information as well).   The BGP protocol suggests that withdrawal information should be   packed in the begining of Update message along with information about   more or less specific reachable routes in a single UPDATE message.   This would help alleviate excessive route flapping in BGP.12.  Limit Rate Updates   The BGP protocol defines different mechanisms to rate limit the   Updates. The BGP protocol defines MinRouteAdvertisementInterval   parameter that determines the minimum time that must be elsape   between the advertisement of routes to a particular destination from   a single BGP speaker. This value is set on a per BGP peer basis.McPherson and Patel                               Section 12.  [Page 13]INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: October 2003               April 200313.  Ordering of Path Attributes   The BGP protocol suggests that BGP speakers sending multiple prefixes   per an UPDATE message should sort and order path attributes according   to Type Codes. This would help their peers to quickly identify sets   of attributes from different update messages which are semantically   different.   Implementers may find it useful to order path attributes according to   Type Code so that sets of attributes with identical semantics can be   more quickly identified.14.  AS_SET Sorting   AS_SETs are commonly used in BGP route aggregation. They reduce the   size of AS_PATH information by listing AS numbers only once   regardless of any number of times it might appear in process of   aggregation. AS_SETs are usually sorted in increasing order to   facilitate efficient lookups of AS numbers within them. This   optimization is entirely optional.15.  Control over Version Negotiation   Because pre-BGP-4 route aggregation can't be supported by earlier   version of BGP, an implementation that supports versions in addition   to BGP-4 should provide the version support on a per-peer basis.16.  Reciept of Non-Transitive Attributes from eBGP Peer   E.g., LOCAL_PREF, RR or confed, etc..   NEEDS MORE WORKMcPherson and Patel                               Section 16.

Security Considerations   BGP provides flexible and extendible mechanism for authentication and   security.  The mechanism allows to support schemes with various   degree of complexity.  All BGP sessions are authenticated based on   the BGP Identifier of a peer.  In addition, all BGP sessions are   authenticated based on the autonomous system number advertised by a   peer.   Since BGP runs over TCP and IP, BGP's authentication scheme may be   augmented by any authentication or security mechanism provided by   either TCP or IP.17.1.  TCP MD5 Signature Option   RFC 2385 defines a way in which the TCP MD5 signature option can be   used to valid information transmitted between two peers.  This method   prevents any third party from injecting information (e.g., a TCP RST)   into the datastream, or modifying the routing information carried   between two BGP peers.  RFC ???? provides suggestions for choosing   passwords to be used with MD5.   TCP MD5 is not ubiquitously deployed at the moment, especially in   inter- domain scenarios, largely because of key distribution issues.   Most key distribution mechanisms are considered to be too "heavy" at   this point.17.2.  BGP Over IPSEC   BGP can run over IPSEC, either in a tunnel, or in transport mode,   where the TCP portion of the IP packet is encrypted.  This not only   prevents random insertion of information into the data stream between   two BGP peers, it also prevents an attacker from learning the data   which is being exchanged between the peers.   IPSEC does, however, offer several options for exchanging session   keys, which may be useful on inter-domain configurations.  These   options are being explored in many deployments, although no   definitive solution has been reach on the issue of key exchange for   BGP in IPSEC.McPherson and Patel                             Section 17.2.  [Page 15]INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: October 2003               April 2003   It should be noted that since BGP runs over TCP and IP, BGP is   vulnerable to the same denial of service or authentication attacks   that are present in any other TCP based protocol.17.3.  Miscellaneous   Another issue any routing protocol faces is providing evidence of the   validity and authority of the routing information carried within the   routing system.  This is currently the focus of several efforts at   the moment, including efforts to define the threats which can be used   against this routing information in BGP [draft-murphy, attack tree],   and efforts at providing a means to provide validation and authority   for routing information carried within BGP [SBGP, soBGP and possibly   ATT stuff].   Should information as it relates to IRR derived prefix-based filters   be included here?   BTSH & RP Queuing...?17.4.
