                    Remote DHCPv6 Autoconfiguration
                    draft-mrugalski-remote-dhcpv6-01

Abstract

   This document describes remote autoconfiguration mechanism, an
   extension to DHCPv6 protocol.  Every time a node attaches to a new
   link, it must renew or obtain new address and parameters, using
   DHCPv6 protocol.  For mobile nodes it is beneficial to obtain address
   and other configuration parameters remotely, before actually
   attaching to destination link.  This document defines mechanism using
   remote configuration and new options required to remotely discover
   destination DHCPv6 servers.  Remote unicast communication with DHCPv6
   servers is also defined.

Internet-Draft       Remote DHCPv6 Autoconfiguration            Oct 2010


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Classic handover and DHCPv6 configuration

   During normal operation, a node attaches to a link (e.g. after
   completing, waking up from standby mode, booting up etc.) and, if
   certain condtions are met (see [RFC4862]), it initiates DHCPv6
   operation.  It is assumed that initial communication with servers
   (directly or via relays) is performed locally, i.e. client and server
   or relay are attached to the same link.

   In certain mobility scenarios, it may be beneficial to initiate
   configuration and obtain parameters before physically attaching to
   local link.  When client (a mobile IPv6 node, likely to be conformant
   to [RFC3775]) changes its physical location, radio signal and other
   metrics deteriorate and eventually handover decision is made.  During
   normal handover procedure, data link layer (e.g.  IEEE 802.11 or IEEE
   802.16) performs handover procedure.  This phase is sometimes
   referred to as link layer handover.  After such procedure is
   completed, IPv6 reconfiguration is started.  After client attaches to
   its new location, it tries to confirm old or obtain new configuration
   parameters, using DHCPv6 CONFIRM or SOLICIT messages.  After
   discovering available DHCPv6 servers, MN requests new address and
   possibly other configuration options.  Once DHCPv6 configuration is
   complete, it may start other handover related activities, like
   updating Correspondent Nodes (CN) or Home Agent (HA) using Binding
   Update procedure [RFC3775].  If aforementioned actions are preformed
   sequencially, delays introduced by each layer are adding up,
   resulting in a large overall delay.  This introduces gaps in
   communication capabilites that should be avoided, if possible.

1.2.  Remote DHCPv6 Rationale

   Instead of performing DHCPv6 configuration after physically attaching
   to a link, client communicates with server (or relay) located at
   destination link remotely, while still being attached to the old
   link.  Assuming client is able to communicate with destination
   server, it may obtain all requested parameters.  Although this
   mechanism is generic and not tied to any specific mobility mechanism,
   there are number of benefits client could gain from learning its
   parameters before handover:

      Mobile Client may perform certain actions earlier, e.g.  Mobile
      Client may send Binding Update notifications to its correspondent
      nodes before performing handover.  This may potentially halve the
      Round Trip Time delay.

      Mobile Client may perform many actions at once, e.g. update CNs
      about its new address while initiating handover preparation.  Some
      network access technologies like IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) allow node to
      initiate handover procedure and remain attached to old base
      station.  Node maintains full communication capability at that
      time.  The exact detachment event is left up to the client.

      Mobile Client may consider several target locations as target
      destinations.  The knowledge about availability (or lack of
      thereof) of requested services may be leveraged during destination
      selection.

   The exact way of exploiting gained knowledge via remote
   autoconfiguration mechanism is outside of scope of this document.


2.  Remote DHCPv6 Operation

   Client, while still connected to its old location, gains information
   about DHCPv6 servers located at possible handover destinations.  One
   of the possible ways to determine such addresses is specified in
   Section 2.1.

   After gaining knowledge about potential destinations, client chooses
   one or more destinations and obtains configuration parameters from
   each chosen location, as defined in Section 2.2.  The target
   selection algorithm is outside of scope of this document.

   After changing point of attachment, client behaves as described in
   [RFC3315]: attempts to verify its address using CONFIRM message.

   Discussion: The concept may be briefly described as "extending
   unicast communication."  Maybe reference to Server Unicast Option
   should be explicitly mentioned?

2.1.  Discovering Neighboring Networks

   Client, while still connected to its old location, sends regular
   SOLICIT, REQUEST, RENEW or REBIND message to its locally available
   DHCPv6 server.  Client includes OPTION_NEIGHBORS code in the
   transmitted Option Request Option (ORO).  Server responds with the
   list of addresses of DHCPv6 servers located at possible handover
   targets.  Such list is conveyed in OPTION_NEIGHBORS option.

2.2.  Remote Autoconfiguration

   Client communicates with remote one or more DHCPv6 servers, located
   at potential destination.  To do so, client transmits SOLICIT message



Mrugalski                Expires April 28, 2011                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft       Remote DHCPv6 Autoconfiguration            Oct 2010


   to known server unicast address and includes OPTION_REMOTE_AUTOCONF
   (defined in Section 3.  Server, supporting remote autoconfiguration
   responds as if the message was received locally, e.g. responds with
   ADVERTISE to client's SOLICIT message.  Client continues remote
   configuration using REQUEST or CONFIRM message.  Server concludes
   remote autoconfiguration by responding using REPLY message.


3.  DHCPv6 Options Format

   Following sections define two DHCPv6 options, used in remote
   autoconfiguration process.

3.1.  Neighbors Option Format

   Neighbors Option is used to announce neighboring DHCPv6 servers,
   located in nearby networks.  Client requests this option to learn
   about DHCPv6 servers located at nearby networks (potential candidates
   for handovers).

   option-len:  Number of specified neghbors, multiplied by 16.

   Neighboring DHCPv6 server Address  One or more IPv6 address of the
             neighboring DHCPv6 servers.

   Discussion: While some network access technologies allow discovery of
   neighboring networks (e.g.  Neighbor Advertisments or Scanning
   mechanism in 802.16 networks), but they provide information on link
   layer level (e.g.  BS ID in case of 802.16 networks).  Some mapping
   between IP information (i.e. neighboring DHCPv6 servers) and link
   layer level (e.g.  BSID) may be considered here.  If such approach is
   deemed feasible, Neighbors Option format should be extended with
   additional link layer information.

3.2.  Remote Autoconfiguration Option

   Remote Autoconfiguration Option is used by the client to inform
   server that it is performing remote configuration, rather than local.

   The Remote Autoconfiguration Option may include suboptions.
   Currently there are no such suboptions defined.

   Discussion: The Remote Autoconfiguration Option is used to inform
   server that client is currently located off-link, but would like to
   get on-link configuration.  Also, it informs server that unicast
   communication from non-local prefix.  However, if server is
   configured to allow such communication, it does not need to know
   about client's current location (just treat it as regular, local

   client).  In that case, this option is not needed.


4.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior

   Servers conformant to this specification MUST support unicast
   communication.

   Server MUST NOT send OPTION_NEIGHBOR to client, unless client
   explicitly requested such option.

   Server MUST respond to client message transmitted off-link if
   OPTION_REMOTE_AUTOCONF option is included in client's message.

   Server SHOULD ignore off-link messages that does not contain
   OPTION_REMOTE_AUTOCONF option.


5.  DHCPv6 Client Behavior

   Client supporting remote autoconfiguration, SHOULD request
   OPTION_NEIGHBORS every time it sends SOLICIT, REQUEST, RENEW, REBIND
   or CONFIRM messages.

   Client MUST include OPTION_REMOTE_AUTOCONF in its messages, if
   communicating with server remotely (i.e. client and server are
   currently not on the same link).

   Client MAY initiate remote autoconfiguration at its own discretion.
   Depending on client policy, that may be as soon as local
   configuration is completed, when radio signal quality degrades and
   handover is imminent or when other implementation specific conditions
   are met.


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate two DHCPv6 option codes referencing
   this document: OPTION_NEIGHBORS and OPTION_REMOTE_AUTOCONF.


7.  Security Considerations

   The overall security considerations discussed in [RFC3315] apply also
   to this document.  OPTION_REMOTE_AUTOCONF may be used to attack known
   DHCPv6 server, but that does not differ from attacks directed at
   servers supporting unicast address option.  Compromised DHCPv6 server
   may be used to misinform clients about available nearby networks.

   Neither of the above considerations are new and specific to the
   proposed remote configuration option.  The mechanisms identified for
   securing DHCPv6 as well as reasonable checks performed by client
   implementations are deemed sufficient in addressing these problems.
