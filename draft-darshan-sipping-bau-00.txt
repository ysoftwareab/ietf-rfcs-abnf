   Abstract 
       
      This document defines a mechanism that helps SIP entities leverage the 
      BAU packet cable specification to support simple IVR applications. It 
      builds upon [1] to add BAU [2] support in addition to the VXML support 
      that is already provided.

1.   Introduction 
    
   The NCS Packet Cable specification [2] BAU or Basic Audio Server, offers 
   standard way of performing typical media server functions like play, 
   record, DTMF detection and reporting. Many commercial media servers already 
   support the BAU package and this document attempts to standardize a SIP 
   interface that utilizes the BAU specification implemented by media servers. 
   The SIP interface described in this document derives from the mechanism 
   defined in [1] and helps SIP servers (like Application servers) to utilize 
   functionality such as audio variables, control of audio interruptibility, 
   digit buffer control, special key sequences and re-prompting during data 
   collection as defined in BAU specifications.

2.   Motivation for BAU SIP Interface 
    
   There is more than one standard method to invoke announcement services on 
   Media servers; a major one being VXML [1]. VXML is designed for creating 
   audio dialogs that feature synthesized speech, digitized audio, recognition 
   of spoken and DTMF input, recording of spoken input, telephony and mixed 
   initiative conversations etc. For applications that wish to use simple play 
   announcement and play and collect operations, VXML could be too "heavy" a 
   solution i.e. in terms of VXML fetch (VXML usually resides on a web server 
   and also could be dynamically generated) and VXML parsing.  
    
   BAU or Base Audio Server is an event package that is defined for MGCP / 
   Megaco and is described in the Packet Cable Audio Server Specification. 
   Though defined for MGCP it is targeted especially towards Media Servers. It 
   provides the standard IVR operations of Play Announcement, Play Collect and 
   Play Record.  
       
   MGCP along with SIP is a commonly used media server control protocol. There 
   are over 50 event packages that have been defined by the IETF/ITU for MGCP 
   / Megaco to provide bearer control functionality. All these packages have 
   been defined specifically for MGCP and not Media Servers. BAU, however, is 
   especially relevant to Media Servers. Though defined specifically for MGCP, 
   we feel it is sufficiently generic to extend to SIP. This reason for this 
   extension would be the simplicity of the specification along with the 
   performance gain it provides in that there is no VXML fetch and processing 
   required thus optimizing network and CPU utilization. 
    
   Note however that SIP-BAU is not intended as a replacement to VXML. It is 
   intended  for  use  in  environments  where  the  requirements  for  user 
   interaction in IVR are relatively simple and straightforward. It is 
   envisioned that Media Servers would provide both VXML and BAU SIP 
   interfaces to Control Agents wishing to initiate bearer and media control. 
    
    
3.   Terminology 
    
   Application Server: It hosts services It acts as a control agent for the 
   Media Server i.e. it negotiates and sets up SIP sessions between UA’s and 
   the media server.  
    
   Media Server: A device that provides functions such as play, collect   
   digits and record functions in IP networks. 
    
   Play and Collect: The mechanism of playing recorded announcements to an end 
   user and gathering user input in the form of dialed DTMF digits. 
    
   VXML: VoiceXML is a W3C standard designed for creating audio dialogs that 
   feature synthesized speech, digitized audio, recognition of spoken and DTMF

   key input, recording of spoken input, telephony, and mixed initiative 
   conversations.  
    
    
4.   BAU Usage 
    
    
4.1    BAU Package Events 
    
   The NCS specification defines certain parameters that can be used with the 
   BAU package. Presented below are some of the parameters along with 
   directions on mandatory parameters that need to be supported in order to 
   achieve inter operability and some that are optional which must be ignored 
   by the media server if not understood. 
    
   There are three sub packages defined for the BAU package namely pa play 
   announcement), pc (Play Announcement and Collect Digits) and pr (Play and 
   Record). 
    
   Presented in the table below is a list of all parameters that can be used 
   with any of the above packages.

   Note: The parameters mentioned above are an optimal subset of the 
   parameters in the BAU specification i.e. it is a minimal set of parameters 
   that MUST be supported in order to achieve inter operability between 
   different implementations. Other parameters defined in BAU CAN be supported 
   but MUST be ignored by media servers that do not understand them. 
    
   Announcement: The file name of the announcement to play. The assumption is 
   that the file is loaded in the media server as is generally the case.  
   Therefore this will typically be a local file URL but other URL schemes 
   (for example HTTP) can also be used. 
    
   Append: If set to true, the audio recording will append to any   existing 
   content in the Recording ID.  Valid values are "true" or "false. 
    
   Clear Digit Buffer: If set to true, it clears the digit buffer before   
   playing the announcement. Valid values are "true" or "false. 
    
   Digit Map: As specified in [4]. Valid digits are 0-9 and '#' and '*'. 
    
   Duration: The maximum duration of time to play a specified announcement.  
   Takes precedence over iteration and interval (interval specified in units 
   of 100 milliseconds). 
    
   First Digit Timer: The amount of time allowed for the user to enter the 
   first digit and is specified in 100's of milliseconds. Default is 50 (5 
   seconds). 
    
   Initial Prompt: The initial announcement prompting the user to enter DTMF 
   digits or speak. 
    
   Inter Digit Timer: The amount of time allowed for the user to enter a   
   digit when no alternative within the digit map has been matched. The timer 
   value is specified in 100's of milliseconds and the default value is 50 (5 
   seconds)

   Interval: The interval of silence to be inserted between iterative plays.  
   The interval of silence is specified in 100's of milliseconds and the 
   default value is 10 (1 second). 
    
   Iterations: The maximum number of times an announcement is to be played. -1 
   indicates that the announcement is to be repeated forever. The default 
   value is 1. 
    
   Number of attempts: The number of attempts the user is allowed to make 
   until a valid digit pattern has been entered/ announcement has been 
   recorded. 
    
   Non Interruptible Play: If set to true, the user needs to hear the   
   complete initial announcement before entering any digits / making a voice 
   recording.  Valid values are "true" or "false. 
    
   Recording ID: It is the URI to be assigned to the physical segment which is 
   to be recorded by the Play Record event. 
    
   Recording Length: The maximum allowable length of the recording and is 
   specified in 100's of milliseconds. -1 indicates no limit. 
    
   Restart Key: Defines a digit map that discards all collected input / 
   recording in progress and re-prompt the user with the original prompt. This 
   key is also referred to as the cancel character. 
    
   Return Key: Defines a digit map that returns the collected digits to the 
   Application Server.  This key is also referred to as the terminating 
   character. 
 
    
4.2    BAU Package Variables 
    
   Certain variable data can be played with the BAU package like date, time, 
   duration etc. The table below lists variable packages that MUST be 
   supported

5.   Formal Syntax 
                  
   In order for the SIP entity to invoke the BAU package in the media server, 
   SIP entity is required to carry following parameters in the SIP headers. 
   The syntax of these parameters uses the augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) as 
   described in [3]. 
    
   DIALOG-URL = sip-ind dialog-ind "@" hostport dialog-parameters 
    
   sip-ind = "sip:" / "sips:" 
    
   dialog-ind = "dialog" 
    
   dialog-parameters = ";" dialog-param [ bau-parameters ] 
    
   dialog-param = "annc.BAU.pa" / "annc.BAU.pc" / "annc.BAU.pr /   
   annc.cancel" 
    
   bau-parameters = bau-param [ bau-parameters ] 
    
   bau-param = ";" bau-keyword "=" bau-value 
    
   bau-keyword = token 
    
   bau-value = token 
    
 
6.   SIP BAU Interface 
 
   A SIP entity can initiate a BAU session by issuing an INVITE or REFER 
   request to the Media Server and can terminate the session with BYE. If the 
   media server needs to return collected DTMF digits, it can do so by sending 
   INFO or any other method as mentioned in section 7. This section provides 
   details on creation, maintenance and teardown of a session with a BAU

6.1    Session Setup 
 
    
   A SIP entity can initiate a BAU session by issuing an INVITE or REFER 
   request to the Media Server.  Typical session setup using the INVITE 
   request is shown below.

                         |        ACK (F3)        | 
                         |----------------------->| 
                         |                        |

   For PA the INVITE message format would be as shown below. The INVITE   
   indicates that pa package of BAU is to be used.  The announcement to be 
   played is welcome.wav (loaded locally in the media server) and the number 
   of iterations is three with an interval of two seconds between each 
   iterations.

6.2    Session Maintenance 
    
   An IVR session generally involves playing announcements to the user   
   and gathering user input in the form of DTMF digits.  Further course   
   of action is determined based on user input.  As a result of this   
   is necessary to place multiple Play and Collect requests inside the   
   same dialog.  The SIP INFO method [5] MUST be used to issue 
   subsequent PA/PC/PR requests after the initial setup using INVITE or 
   REFER [6]. 
    
   A SIP entity can initiate an BAU session by issuing an INVITE or   
   REFER request to the Media Server. Typical session setup using the   
   INVITE request is shown below.

   The message flow indicates two announcements requests being issued to 
   the media server. The first one (INVITE in this case) creates a SIP 
   dialog and the second INFO issues one more request within the dialog 
   created by the INVITE. For the sake of illustration let us assume   
   that both the requests issued are for Play and Collect Operations

         F2 and F3 messages are identical to those shown in section 5.1. 
 
6.3    Session Teardown 
    
   The dialog can be terminated by either the media server or the    
   requesting SIP entity by issuing a SIP BYE request. It is recommended 
   that it is always the requesting entity that controls the setup and 
   teardown of the dialog 
 
6.4    Rejection 
    
   As defined in [1] if the announcement to be played is not found then 
   the request is rejected with a 404 NOT FOUND response code. An 
   appropriate reason phrase will accompany this error code.  
    
   If the media server cannot perform the requested operation then it 
   must respond with a 488 NOT ACCEPTABLE HERE response code.  
 
   If there is a keyword without a corresponding value or the request URI 
   format is invalid in some way, the request must be rejected with a 400 BAD 
   REQUEST response code. 
 
 
7.   Returning DTMF Digits 
 
   This document places no restriction on the mechanism adopted to 
   return DTMF digits to the requesting entity. Some methods that can be 
   used to carry DTMF digits are:-

                   draft-darshan-sipping-bau              December 2005 
 
 
   Carrying DTMF in media: This has the disadvantage of not working with   
   compressed media 
    
   Special Encoding in RTP ([RFC 2833]): Can be sent separate from media but 
   requires a special [RFC 2833] compliant encoder/decoder at each UA. 
    
   Encode data using INFO method: Sent along call signaling path but still 
   requires the use of an [RFC 2833] encoder/decoder. 
    
   DTMF data using INFO with digits encoded as text: There are no out of   
   order issues in this case and is recommended that this is the method that 
   CAN be used to carry DTMF digits.  It is not yet a standard but we expect 
   some such method to be standardized soon.

9.   Security Considerations 
 
   Standard SIP authorization mechanisms can be used by the media server to 
   validate requests by clients. The mechanism defined in this document does 
   not lead to any new security issues that need to be addressed.
