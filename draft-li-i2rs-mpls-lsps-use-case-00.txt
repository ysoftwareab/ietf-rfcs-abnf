                        I2RS MPLS LSPs Use Case
                  draft-li-i2rs-mpls-lsps-use-case-00

Abstract

   The Label-switched paths (LSPs) play fundument role in MPLS domain.
   Traditionally Label-switched paths (LSPs) are established by the
   network operator via CLI, SNMP or NETCONF for a variety of purposes,
   such as to create network-based IP virtual private networks or to
   route traffic along specified paths through the network.  Interface
   to the Routing System's (I2RS) Programmatic interfaces provides an
   alternate way to create and maintain the LSPs.This document describes
   requirement and use case for which I2RS can be used for LSPs
   management.

1.  Introduction

   The Label Swicth Paths (LSPs) is a fundement element that play key
   role for package trsanport in MPLS domain.  Traditionally LSP may be
   managed via CLI, SNMP or NETCONF.

   Interface to Routing System (I2RS) architecture
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture] defines a standard, programmatic
   interface to routing system.  The I2RS is not intended to replace any
   existing configuration mechanisms.  Instead, I2RS is intended to
   augment those existing mechanisms by defining a standardized set of
   programmatic interfaces to enable easier configuration, management
   and analysis of the networks source

   This document describes requirement and use case for which I2RS can
   be used for establishing LSPs connection.  The use case described in
   this document encompass: LSPs configure, LSPs events.

Internet-Draft           I2RS MPLS LSPs Use Case           November 2014


2.  LSPs Configure

   LSPs is fundment element in the MPLS domain's network.By I2RS
   interface the network application can setup LSPs through policy
   configure.The application can select proper programmatic interface.

2.1.  LSPs Connection

   The basic stage of LSPs includes establishing, maintaining and
   revocation.  Paths computation in large MPLS-domain networks is
   complex and may require special computational components and
   cooperation between the different elements.

   Traditionally in order to configure a static LSP that need
   configuring the ingress router and each router along the path and
   including the egress router.The tasks encompass:Configuring the
   Ingress Router,Configuring the Intermediate (Transit) and Egress
   Routers and etc.  The ingress router computes path according to the
   network topology and the request of user , and hop-by- hop down the
   request to establish the path.The ingress edge router knows the
   current topology of the network,But it does not know the available
   resource information of router along the path. so it needs to
   establish sessions-by-hop to issue a label request until it reaches
   the egress router, and then again along the reverse path established
   LSP.In this case, if a router on the path does not meet the
   demand,the ingress router accepts the request must recalculate path
   or other paths in low service level which have the required router
   may be sacrificed in order to meet LSP.

Internet-Draft           I2RS MPLS LSPs Use Case           November 2014


           Figure 1: Use case for MPLS establishing LSPs of I2RS

   In the I2RS architecture , edge router agent connected with client in
   MPLS domain.To establish an LSP, operator may make a request to edge
   router agent, then edge router transmit to client, operator can also
   make a request to client.  By I2rs architecture , client can get
   real-time topology of the entire network and local router resource
   view , so client can be computed LSPs according to the demand of
   user, and issuing LSR FIB under the corresponding resource
   requirements on the path. if there is a resource conflict,client can
   coordinate and adjust the paths associated with the LSPs according to
   application service level.

2.2.  Capability negotiation

   LSPs Connection supports some policy configuration which are used to
   control the allocation of network source,to avoide the specify
   router/switch and acceptance of optimal recommend path and so on.

   With I2RS a network operator can push LSPs demand request policy
   configuration using a programmatic API from an I2RS client to
   specific agent according to the service requirement.

3.  LSPs Events

   I2RS could provide a publish-subscribe capability to applications to
   subscribe state and number of LSPs and related events according to
   demand.

3.1.  Notification of LSP Events

   Some applications adopt LSPs established to carry service and the
   end-user would care about the state of such LSPs and hope to know and
   the changes of their state immediately .There are many technologies
   to detect LSPs failures, such as OAM/RSVP hello,When a LSP failure is
   detected, the end-user hope receive the immediately notification.

3.2.  LSPs Statistics

   There are several statistics related to LSPs like the count of
   LSPs.These statistics can help network operators know about the
   status of the resources network makes use of.

   Some access device has limited capacity resource and need restricting
   the maximum capacity of LSP.  The network administrator wants to know
   whether the current capacity of LSP is close to the maximum capacity.

Internet-Draft           I2RS MPLS LSPs Use Case           November 2014


   The application can set the maximum number of LSPs by I2RS
   programmatic API.  The application can set the warning threshold too.
   When LSPs reaches the threshold the warning message will be triggered
   and notify the application in the I2RS client.  The operator can take
   some action according to the warning message.

4.  Security Considerations

   The LSPs use cases described in this document assumes use of I2RS's
   programmatic interfaces described in the I2RS archtechture mentioned
   in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture].  This document does not change the
   underlying security issues inherent in the existing.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.
