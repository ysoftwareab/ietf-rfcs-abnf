Abstract 
    
   The Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) suite of protocols has been defined to 
   control different switching technologies as well as different 
   applications. These include support for requesting TDM connections 
   including SONET/SDH and Optical Transport Networks (OTNs).

   This document provides an evaluation of the IETF Routing Protocols 
   against the routing requirements for an Automatically Switched 
   Optical Network (ASON) as defined by ITU-T.

3. Introduction 
    
   There are certain capabilities that are needed to support the ITU-T 
   Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON) control plane 
   architecture as defined in [G.8080].  
    
   [ASON-RR] details the routing requirements for the GMPLS routing 
   suite of protocols to support the capabilities and functionality of 
   ASON control planes identified in [G.7715] and in [G.7715.1]. The 
   ASON routing architecture provides for a conceptual reference 
   architecture, with definition of functional components and common 
   information elements to enable end-to-end routing in the case of 
   protocol heterogeneity and facilitate management of ASON networks. 
   This description is only conceptual: no physical partitioning of 
   these functions is implied. 
    
   However, [ASON-RR] does not address GMPLS routing protocol 
   applicability or capabilities. This document evaluates the IETF 
   Routing Protocols against the requirements identified in [ASON-RR]. 
   The result of this evaluation is detailed in Section 5. Close 
   examination of applicability scenarios and the result of the 
   evaluation of these scenarios are provided in Section 6. 
    
   ASON (Routing) terminology sections are provided in Appendix 1 and 2. 
    
4. Requirements - Overview 
    
   The following functionality is expected from GMPLS routing protocol 
   to instantiate the ASON hierarchical routing architecture realization 
   (see [G.7715] and [G.7715.1]): 
   - Routing Areas (RAs) shall be uniquely identifiable within a  
     carrier's network, each having a unique RA Identifier (RA ID)  
     within the carrier's network. 
   - Within a RA (one level), the routing protocol shall support  
     dissemination of hierarchical routing information (including  
     summarized routing information for other levels) in support of an

     architecture of multiple hierarchical levels of RAs; the number of  
     hierarchical RA levels to be supported by a routing protocol is  
     implementation specific. 
   - The routing protocol shall support routing information based on a  
     common set of information elements as defined in [G.7715] and  
     [G.7715.1], divided between attributes pertaining to links and  
     abstract nodes (each representing either a sub-network or simply a  
     node). [G.7715] recognizes that the manner in which the routing  
     information is represented and exchanged will vary with the  
     routing protocol used. 
   - The routing protocol shall converge such that the distributed  
     Routing DataBases (RDB) become synchronized after a period of  
     time. 
    
   To support dissemination of hierarchical routing information, the 
   routing protocol must deliver: 
   - Processing of routing information exchanged between adjacent  
     levels of the hierarchy (i.e. Level N+1 and N) including  
     reachability and upon policy decision summarized topology  
     information. 
   - Self-consistent information at the receiving level resulting from 
     any transformation (filter, summarize, etc.) and forwarding of 
     information from one Routing Controller (RC) to RC(s) at different  
     levels when multiple RCs bound to a single RA. 
   - A mechanism to prevent re-introduction of information propagated 
     into the Level N RA's RC back to the adjacent level RA's RC from 
     which this information has been initially received. 
    
   Note: the number of hierarchical levels to be supported is routing 
   protocol specific and reflects a containment relationship. 
    
   Reachability information may be advertised either as a set of UNI 
   Transport Resource address prefixes, or a set of associated 
   Subnetwork Point Pool (SNPP) link IDs/SNPP link ID prefixes, assigned 
   and selected consistently in their applicability scope. The formats 
   of the control plane identifiers in a protocol realization are 
   implementation specific. Use of a routing protocol within a RA should 
   not restrict the choice of routing protocols for use in other RAs 
   (child or parent). 
    
   As ASON does not restrict the control plane architecture choice used, 
   either a co-located architecture or a physically separated 
   architecture may be used. A collection of links and nodes such as a 
   sub-network or RA must be able to represent itself to the wider 
   network as a single logical entity with only its external links 
   visible to the topology database. 
    
5. Evaluation 
    
   This section evaluates support of existing IETF routing protocols 
   with respect to the requirements summarized from [ASON-RR] in Section

   4. Candidate routing protocols are IGP (OSPF and IS-IS) and BGP. The 
   latter in not addressed in the current version of this document. 
    
5.1 Terminology and Identification 
    
   - Pi is a physical node (bearer/data/transport plane) node  
   - Li is a logical control plane identifier that is associated to a  
     single data plane (abstract) node  
     Li = logical node id or "TE router id" i.e. for  
     . RFC 3630: Router_Address (top level) TLV of the Type 1 TE LSA  
     . RFC 3784: Traffic Engineering Router ID TLV (Type 134)  
   - Ri is a control plane "router" e.g. (advertising) Router_ID i.e.  
     . RFC 2328: Router ID (32-bit)  
     . RFC 1195: IS-IS System ID (48-bit)  
     
   The Router_ID (represented by Ri) does not enter into the 
   identification of the logical entities representing the data plane 
   resources such as links. The Routing DataBase (RDB) is associated to 
   the Ri.  
    
   Aside from the Li/Pi mappings, these identifiers are not assumed to 
   be in a particular entity relationship, e.g., an Ri may have 
   multiple Li in its scope. 
    
   Note: Si is a control plane signaling function associated with one 
   or more Li. 
    
5.2 RA Identification 
    
   TBD 
    
5.3 Routing Information Exchange 
    
   We focus on routing information exchange between Ri entities 
   (through routing adjacencies) within single hierarchical level. 
   Routing information mapping between levels may require specific 
   guidelines.  
    
   The control plane does not transport Pi information as these are 
   data plane addresses for which the Li/Pi mapping is kept (link) 
   local - see for instance the transport LMP document [LMP-T] where 
   such exchange is described. Example: the transport plane identifier 
   is the Pi (the identifier assigned to the physical element) be for 
   instance "666B.F999.AF10.222C", the control plane identifier is the 
   Li (the identifier assigned by the control plane), be for instance 
   "1.1.1.1".  
    
   The control plane exchanges the control plane identifier information 
   but not the transport plane identifier information (i.e. not 
   "666B.F999.AF10.222C" but only "1.1.1.1"). The mapping Li/Pi is kept  
   local. So, when the Si receives a control plane message requesting 
   the use of "1.1.1.1", Si knows locally that this information refers

   to the data plane entity identified by the transport plane 
   identifier "666B.F999.AF10.222C".  
    
   The control plane carries:  
   1) its view of the data plane link end-points and other link 
   connection end-points      
   2) the identifiers scoped by the Li's i.e. referred to as an 
   associated IPv4/IPv6 addressing space;  
    
5.2.1 Link Attributes 
    
   From the list of link attributes and characteristics (detailed in 
   [ASON-RR], the Local Adaptation support information is missing as TE 
   link attribute. GMPLS routing does not currently consider the use of 
   dedicated TE link attribute(s) to describe the cross/inter-layer 
   relationships. All other TE link attributes and characteristics are 
   currently covered. 
    
   However, the representation of bandwidth requires further analysis 
   i.e. GMPLS Routing defines an Interface Switching Capability 
   Descriptor (ISCD) that delivers information about the (maximum/ 
   minimum) bandwidth per priority an LSP can make use of. In the ASON 
   context, other representations are possible, e.g., in terms of a set 
   of tuples <signal_type; number of unallocated timeslots>. The latter 
   also may require definition of additional signal types (from those 
   defined in [RFC 3496]) to represent contiguous concatenation i.e. 
   STS-(3xN)c SPE / VC-4-Nc, N = 4, 16, 64, 256.  
    
   The method proposed in [GMPLS-RTG] is the most straightforward 
   without requiring any bandwidth accounting change from an LSR 
   perspective. However, it introduces some lost of information. This 
   lost of information affects the number of signals that can be used 
   but not the range they cover. On the other hand, if additional 
   technology specific information (such as capabilities) are 
   advertised a finer grained resource countdown and accounting can be 
   performed allowing for network wide resource allocation in Sonet/SDH 
   environments. 
 
5.2.2 Node Attributes 
    
   Nodes attributes include the "Logical Node ID" (as detailed in 
   Section 6.1) and the reachability information as described in 
   Section 6.2.3. 
    
5.2.3 Reachability Information 
    
   Advertisement of reachability can be achieved using the techniques 
   described in [OSPF-NODE] where the set of local addresses are 
   carried in a OSPF TE LSA node attribute TLV (a specific sub-TLV is 
   defined per address family, e.g., IPv4 and IPv6).

   A similar mechanism does not exist for IS-IS as the Extended IP 
   Reachability TLV [RFC3784] focuses on IP reachable end-points 
   (terminating points), as its name indicates.   
    
   In order to advertise blocks of reachable address prefixes a 
   summarization mechanism is additionally required. This mechanism may 
   take the form of an prefix length (that indicates the number of 
   significant bits in the prefix) or a network mask. 
    
5.3 Routing Information Abstraction  
    
   TBD 
    
5.4 Dissemination of routing information in support of multiple 
hierarchical levels of RAs 
    
   TBD 
    
5.6 Routing Protocol Convergence 
    
   Link state protocols have been designed to detect topological 
   changes (such as interface failures, link attributes modification). 
   Convergence period is short and involves a minimum of routing 
   information exchange. 
    
   Therefore, existing routing protocol convergence mechanisms are 
   sufficient for ASON applications. 
    
6. Evaluation Scenarios 
    
   The evaluation scenarios are the following: referred to as 
   respectively case 1), 2), 3) and 4). Additional base scenarios 
   (being not combinations or decomposition of entities) may further 
   complete this set in a future revision of this document.

Appendix 1: ASON Terminology 
    
   This document makes use of the following terms: 
    
   Administrative domain: (see Recommendation G.805) for the purposes of 
   [G7715.1] an administrative domain represents the extent of resources 
   which belong to a single player such as a network operator, a service 
   provider, or an end-user. Administrative domains of different players 
   do not overlap amongst themselves. 
    
   Control plane: performs the call control and connection control 
   functions. Through signaling, the control plane sets up and releases 
   connections, and may restore a connection in case of a failure. 
    
   (Control) Domain: represents a collection of (control) entities that 
   are grouped for a particular purpose. The control plane is subdivided 
   into domains matching administrative domains. Within an 
   administrative domain, further subdivisions of the control plane are 
   recursively applied. A routing control domain is an abstract entity 
   that hides the details of the RC distribution. 
    
   External NNI (E-NNI): interfaces are located between protocol 
   controllers between control domains. 
    
   Internal NNI (I-NNI): interfaces are located between protocol 
   controllers within control domains. 
    
   Link: (see Recommendation G.805) a "topological component" which 
   describes a fixed relationship between a "subnetwork" or "access 
   group" and another "subnetwork" or "access group". Links are not 
   limited to being provided by a single server trail.  
    
   Management plane: performs management functions for the Transport 
   Plane, the control plane and the system as a whole. It also provides 
   coordination between all the planes. The following management 
   functional areas are performed in the management plane: performance, 
   fault, configuration, accounting and security management 
    
   Management domain: (see Recommendation G.805) a management domain 
   defines a collection of managed objects which are grouped to meet 
   organizational requirements according to geography, technology, 
   policy or other structure, and for a number of functional areas such 
   as configuration, security, (FCAPS), for the purpose of providing 
   control in a consistent manner. Management domains can be disjoint, 
   contained or overlapping. As such the resources within an 
   administrative domain can be distributed into several possible 
   overlapping management domains. The same resource can therefore 
   belong to several management domains simultaneously, but a management 
   domain shall not cross the border of an administrative domain. 
    
   Subnetwork Point (SNP): The SNP is a control plane abstraction that 
   represents an actual or potential transport plane resource. SNPs (in

   different subnetwork partitions) may represent the same transport 
   resource. A one-to-one correspondence should not be assumed. 
    
   Subnetwork Point Pool (SNPP): A set of SNPs that are grouped together 
   for the purposes of routing. 
    
   Termination Connection Point (TCP): A TCP represents the output of a 
   Trail Termination function or the input to a Trail Termination Sink 
   function. 
 
   Transport plane: provides bi-directional or unidirectional transfer 
   of user information, from one location to another. It can also 
   provide transfer of some control and network management information. 
   The Transport Plane is layered; it is equivalent to the Transport 
   Network defined in G.805 Recommendation. 
    
   User Network Interface (UNI): interfaces are located between protocol 
   controllers between a user and a control domain. Note: there is no 
   routing function associated with a UNI reference point.

Appendix 2: ASON Routing Terminology 
    
   This document makes use of the following terms: 
    
   Routing Area (RA): a RA represents a partition of the data plane and 
   its identifier is used within the control plane as the representation 
   of this partition. Per [G.8080] a RA is defined by a set of sub-
   networks, the links that interconnect them, and the interfaces 
   representing the ends of the links exiting that RA. A RA may contain 
   smaller RAs inter-connected by links. The limit of subdivision 
   results in a RA that contains two sub-networks interconnected by a 
   single link. 
    
   Routing Database (RDB): repository for the local topology, network 
   topology, reachability, and other routing information that is updated 
   as part of the routing information exchange and may additionally 
   contain information that is configured. The RDB may contain routing 
   information for more than one Routing Area (RA). 
    
   Routing Components: ASON routing architecture functions. These 
   functions can be classified as protocol independent (Link Resource 
   Manager or LRM, Routing Controller or RC) and protocol specific 
   (Protocol Controller or PC).  
    
   Routing Controller (RC): handles (abstract) information needed for 
   routing and the routing information exchange with peering RCs by 
   operating on the RDB. The RC has access to a view of the RDB. The RC 
   is protocol independent. 
    
   Note: Since the RDB may contain routing information pertaining to 
   multiple RAs (and possibly to multiple layer networks), the RCs 
   accessing the RDB may share the routing information. 
    
   Link Resource Manager (LRM): supplies all the relevant component and 
   TE link information to the RC. It informs the RC about any state 
   changes of the link resources it controls. 
    
   Protocol Controller (PC): handles protocol specific message exchanges 
   according to the reference point over which the information is 
   exchanged (e.g. E-NNI, I-NNI), and internal exchanges with the RC. 
   The PC function is protocol dependent.
