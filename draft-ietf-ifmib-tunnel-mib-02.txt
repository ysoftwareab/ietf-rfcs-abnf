1.  Introduction

This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management Information
Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
community.  In particular, it describes managed objects used for
managing tunnels of any type in IP networks, including GRE [16,17], IP-
in-IP [18], Minimal Encapsulation [19], L2TP [20], L2F [25], and PPTP
[21] tunnels.  Extension MIBs (e.g., [22]) may be designed for managing
protocol-specific objects.  Likewise, extension MIBs may be designed for

3.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
components:

o    An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [1].

o    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
     purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
     Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in RFC
     1155 [2], RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The second version, called
     SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5], RFC 1903 [6] and RFC 1904 [7].

o    Message protocols for transferring management information. The
     first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
     described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message
     protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
     called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
     The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and
     described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11] and RFC 2274 [12].

o    Protocol operations for accessing management information. The first
     set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described

     in RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations and associated
     PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

o    A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and
     the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275 [15].

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are defined
using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A MIB
conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
MIB.


3.1.  Object Definitions

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are defined
using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the
SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
an administratively assigned name.  The object type together with an
object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of
the object.  For human convenience, we often use a textual string,
termed the descriptor, to refer to the object type.


4.  Overview

This MIB module contains two tables:

o    the Tunnel Interface Table, containing information on the tunnels
     known to a router; and

o    the Tunnel Config Table, which is used for dynamic creation of
     tunnels.

4.1.  Relationship to the Interfaces MIB

This section clarifies the relationship of this MIB to the Interfaces
MIB [23].  Several areas of correlation are addressed in the following
subsections.  The implementor is referred to the Interfaces MIB document
in order to understand the general intent of these areas.


4.1.1.  Layering Model

Each logical interface (physical or virtual) has an ifEntry in the
Interfaces MIB [23].  Tunnels are handled by creating a logical
interface (ifEntry) for each tunnel.  These are then correlated to
physical interfaces using the ifStack table of the Interfaces MIB.  The
basic model, therefore, looks something like this (for example):

   | |         | |          | |
+--+ +---+  +--+ +---+      | |
|IP-in-IP|  |  GRE   |      | |
| tunnel |  | tunnel |      | |
+--+ +---+  +--+ +---+      | |
   | |         | |          | |    <== attachment to physical
+--+ +---------+ +----------+ +--+     interfaces, to be provided
|       Physical interface       |     by ifStack table
+--------------------------------+


4.1.2.  ifTestTable

   The ifTestTable usage is defined in the MIBs defining the
   encapsulation below the network layer.  For example, if IP-in-IP
   encapsulation is being used, the ifTestTable is defined by IP-in-IP.


4.1.3.  ifRcvAddressTable

   The ifRcvAddressTable usage is defined in the MIBs defining the
   encapsulation below the network layer.  For example, if IP-in-IP
   encapsulation is being used, the ifRcvAddressTable is defined by IP-
   in-IP.

Draft                        IP Tunnel MIB                     July 1998


4.1.4.  ifEntry

   IfEntries are defined in the MIBs defining the encapsulation below
   the network layer.  For example, if IP-in-IP encapsulation [20] is
   being used, the ifEntry is defined by IP-in-IP.

   The ifType of a tunnel should be set to "tunnel" (131).  An entry in
   the IP Tunnel MIB will exist for every ifEntry with this ifType.  An
   implementation of the IP Tunnel MIB MAY allow ifEntries to be created
   via the tunnelConfigTable.  Creating a tunnel will also add an entry
   in the ifTable and in the tunnelIfTable, and deleting a tunnel will
   likewise delete the entry in the ifTable and the tunnelIfTable.

   The use of two different tables in this MIB was an important design
   decision.  Traditionally, ifIndex values are chosen by agents, and
   are permitted to change across restarts.  Allowing row creation
   directly in the Tunnel Interface Table, indexed by ifIndex, would
   complicate row creation and/or cause interoperability problems (if
   each agent had special restrictions on ifIndex). Instead, a separate
   table is used which is indexed only by objects over which the manager
   has control.  Namely, these are the addresses of the tunnel endpoints
   and the encapsulation protocol.  Finally, an additional manager-
   chosen ID is used in the index to support protocols such as L2F which
   allow multiple tunnels between the same endpoints.

6.  Security Considerations

This MIB contains readable objects whose values provide information
related to IP tunnel interfaces.  There are also a number of objects
that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create, such as
those which allow an administrator to dynamically configure tunnels.

While unauthorized access to the readable objects is relatively
innocuous, unauthorized access to the write-able objects could cause a
denial of service, or could cause unauthorized creation and/or
manipulation of tunnels. Hence, the support for SET operations in a
non-secure environment without proper protection can have a negative
effect on network operations.

SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the network
itself is secure (for example by using IPSec [24]), even then, there is
no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and SET
(change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features
as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of the
User-based Security Model RFC 2274 [12] and the View-based Access
Control Model RFC 2275 [15] is recommended.

It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity
giving access to this MIB, is properly configured to give access to
those objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
rights to access them.
