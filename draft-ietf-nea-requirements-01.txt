 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
   This document defines the problem statement, scope and interface 
   (protocol) requirements between the components of the NEA (Network 
   Endpoint Assessment) reference model.  NEA provides owners of 
   networks (e.g. an enterprise offering remote access) a mechanism to 
   evaluate the posture of a system.  This may take place during the 
   request for network access and/or subsequently at any time while 
   connected to the network.  The learned posture information can then 
   be applied to a variety of compliance oriented decisions.  The 
   posture information is frequently useful for detecting systems that 
   are lacking (or have out of date) security protective mechanisms 
   (e.g. anti-virus, firewall). 
 
   In order to provide context for the requirements, a reference 
   model and terminology are introduced.  This model is provided for 
   informational purposes but is based on the models used by NAC 
   [CNAC], NAP[NAP] and TNC[TNC].

 1. Introduction 
    
    Today, most network providers can leverage existing standards-
    based technologies to restrict access to their network based 
    upon criteria such as the requesting system's user or host-based 
    identity, source IP address or physical access point.  However 
    these approaches still leave the network vulnerable to malware-
    based attack, when an authorized but infected system is admitted 
    and the malware is able to spread throughout the internal 
    network. 
     
    As a result, network operators need a proactive mechanism to 
    assess the state of systems joining or present on the network to 
    determine their status relative to network compliance policies.  
    For example, if a system is determined to be out of compliance 
    because it is lacking proper defensive mechanisms such as 
    firewalls, anti-virus software or the absence of critical 
    security patches, there needs to be a way to safely repair 
    (remediate) the system so that it can be subsequently trusted to 
    join and operate on the network.  The NEA technology strives to 
    provide a mechanism to report the configuration of an endpoint 
    for evaluation against network compliance policy.  Such a 
    mechanism could offer a useful tool for the network operators'
    arsenal but should be recognized as not being a complete 
    Endpoint compliance solution in and of itself.

 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
    Network Endpoint Assessment (NEA) architectures have been 
    implemented in the industry allowing the network to have 
    visibility into the configuration of the system (e.g. security 
    Posture). These can evaluate compliance when the system requests 
    access to the network or at any time while the system is 
    connected to the network, enabling that system's compliance 
    status to be factored into various admission and access control 
    decisions.  NEA typically involves the use of special client 
    software running on the requesting system that observes and 
    reports on the configuration of the system to the network 
    infrastructure.  The infrastructure has corresponding validation 
    software that is capable of comparing the system configuration 
    information with network compliance policy and providing the 
    result to appropriate authorization entities that make decisions 
    about network and application access.   
     
    In many cases, the admission decision is provisioned to the 
    enforcement mechanisms on the network and/or system requesting 
    access.  The decision might allow for no access, limited access 
    (possibly to allow for remediation), or full access to the 
    network. While the NEA Working Group recognizes there is a link 
    between an assessment and the enforcement of the assessment 
    decision, the mechanisms and protocols for enforcement are not 
    in scope for this specification. 
     
    Architectures, similar to NEA, have existed in the industry for 
    some time and are present in shipping products, but do not offer 
    interoperability.  Some examples of such architectures include: 
    Trusted Computing Group's TNC [TNC], Microsoft's NAP [NAP], 
    Cisco's NAC [CNAC]). These technologies assess the software or 
    hardware configuration of endpoint devices for the purposes of 
    monitoring or enforcing compliance to an organization's policy 
    at the time of access to the network. These architectures are 
    not interoperable since most of the technologies used to 
    implement the architecture are proprietary and not standards. 
     
    The NEA working group is working on defining standard protocols 
    so as to enable interoperability between devices from different 
    vendors allowing network owners to deploy truly heterogeneous 
    solutions. This document describes the requirements for NEA 
    candidate technologies and protocols.

 2. Terminology 
 
    This section defines a set of terms used throughout this 
    document.  In some cases these terms have been used in other 
    contexts with different meanings so this section attempts to 
    describe each term's meaning with respect to the NEA WG 
    activities. 
     
    Assessment - The process of collecting Posture from a set of 
      Endpoint Components such that the appropriate validators may 
      evaluate the Posture against compliance policy.   
     
    Assertion Attributes - Class of Attribute including re-usable 
      information about the success of a prior Assessment of the 
      Endpoint.  This could be used to optimize subsequent 
      Assessments by avoiding a full Posture re-Assessment.  For 
      example, this type of Attribute might be issued specifically 
      to a particular Endpoint, dated and signed by the NEA Server 
      allowing that Endpoint to re-use it for a time period to 
      assert compliance to a set of policies.  The NEA Server might 
      accept this in lieu of obtaining Posture information. 
     
    Attribute - Data element including any requisite meta-data 
      describing an observed, expected or status of a Component 
      property.  NEA recognizes a variety of classes of Attributes 
      particular to their usage: Assertion Attributes, Compliance 
      Claim Attributes, Posture Attributes, Policy Attributes, 
      Request Attributes, Result Attributes, and Remediation 
      Attributes.  Within each class, there are two different types 
      of Attributes: standard and vendor-specific.  The standard 
      attributes will be standardized by the NEA WG. 
     
    Compliance Claim Attribute - Class of Attribute used by an NEA 
      Client to claim that the Endpoint complies with a particular 
      policy.  For example, these Attributes are used when the NEA 
      Client is offered Policy Attributes and wishes to claim 
      compliance with the Policy rather then provide Posture 
      Attributes to show compliance. 
     
    Component - Software, hardware or firmware entity performing a 
      particular logical function on the Endpoint. For example, a 
      component may be a Posture Collector designed to ascertain 
      the Posture of another Component such as a particular vendor 
      product (e.g. Norton Anti-Virus) running on the Endpoint. 
     
    Deployer - Role of an entity that makes available for use 
      hardware and/or software solutions.  For example, an

 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
      administrator within an enterprise IT department might 
      release an NEA Server for use on its network. 
     
    Dialog - Sequence of request/response Messages exchanged  
     
    Endpoint - Any host computing device that can be connected to a 
      network.  This includes: laptops, desktops, servers, cell 
      phone or any device with an IP address. 
     
    Message - Self contained unit of communication between 
      Components.  For example, a PA Message might carry a set of 
      Posture Attributes from a Posture Collector to a Posture 
      Validator. 
     
    Owner - the role of an entity who is the legal, rightful 
      possessor on an asset (e.g. Endpoint).  The owner is entitled 
      to maintain control over the policies enforced on the device 
      even if the asset is not within the Owner's possession.  The 
      Owner may permit User override or augmentation of control 
      policies or may not assert any policies limiting use of 
      asset. 
     
    Policy Attributes - Class of Attribute sent by an NEA Server 
      describing (or referencing) the desired policy to be met by a 
      set of Components on the Endpoint.  For example, Policy 
      Attributes might be used to enable an NEA Client to determine 
      whether the Endpoint is compliant without disclosing Posture 
      information.  Instead, the NEA Client makes claims of 
      compliance to policy in Compliance Claim Attributes. 
     
    Posture - Configuration and/or status of hardware or software 
      Component(s) on an Endpoint as it pertains to an 
      organization's security policy. 
     
    Posture Attributes - Class of Attribute describing a quality or 
      characteristic of a Component.  For example, a Posture 
      Attribute might describe the version of a Component installed 
      on the system.  Posture Attributes are normally created by a 
      Posture Collector for inclusion in a Posture description of 
      an Endpoint. 
     
    Request Attributes - Class of Attribute containing the list of 
      Attributes the NEA Client is requested to send to the NEA 
      Server. 
     
    Remediation Attributes - Class of Attribute including the 
      remediation instructions for how to bring an endpoint into 
      compliance with one or more policies.

 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
    Result Attributes - Class of Attribute describing whether the 
      Endpoint is in compliance with NEA policy.  The Result 
      Attribute is created by the NEA Server normally at the 
      conclusion of the Assessment to indicate whether the Endpoint 
      was considered compliant or not.  Multiple of these 
      Attributes may be used allowing for Posture Validator level 
      decisions to be communicated in addition to an overall, 
      global posture decision from the Posture Broker Server. 
     
    Session - Stateful connection (e.g. PB protocol described in 
      Section 3) capable of carrying one or more Messages from 
      multiple subscribed Posture Collectors and Validators. 
     
    User - Role of an entity that is making use of the services of 
      an Endpoint.  The User may not own the Endpoint so might need 
      to operate within the acceptable use constraints defined by 
      the Endpoint's Owner.  For example, an enterprise employee 
      might be a User of a computer provided by the enterprise 
      (Owner) to perform her job. 
     
 3. Applicability 
 
    This section discusses the scope of technologies being 
    standardized and the network environments where it is envisioned 
    that the NEA technologies might be applicable.   
     
 3.1 Scope 
     
    The priority of the NEA working group is to develop standard 
    protocols at the higher layers in the Reference Model (see 
    section 5): the Posture Attribute protocol (PA) and the Posture 
    Broker protocol (PB).  PA and PB will be designed to be carried 
    over a variety of lower layer transport (PT) protocols.  When 
    used with standard lower layer protocols, the PA and PB 
    protocols are intended to allow interoperability between an NEA 
    Client from one vendor and an NEA Server from another.  This 
    specification will not focus on the interfaces between NEA 
    Reference Model Components nor requirements their internals.  
    Any discussion of these aspects is provided to provide context 
    for understanding the model and resulting requirements. 
     
    Some tangent areas not shown in the Reference Model that are 
    also out of scope for the NEA working group, and thus this 
    specification, include:

 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
      o Standardizing the protocols and mechanisms for enforcing 
        restricted network access,  
      o Developing standard protocols for remediation of non-
        compliant Endpoints,  
      o Detecting or handling lying Endpoints (see section 8.1.1 
        for more information). 
     
 3.2 Applicability of Environments 
 
    Because the NEA model is based on special software being present 
    on the Endpoint and in the network infrastructure and the nature 
    of the information being exposed, the use of NEA technologies 
    may not apply in a variety of situations possible on the 
    Internet.  Therefore, this section discusses some of the 
    scenarios where NEA is most likely to be applicable and some 
    where it may not.  Ultimately, the use of NEA within a 
    deployment is not restricted to just these scenarios.  The 
    decision of whether to use NEA technologies lies in the hands of 
    the Deployer (e.g. network provider) based upon the expected 
    relationship they have with the Owners and Users of potential 
    Endpoints. 
     
    NEA technologies are largely focused on scenarios where the 
    Owner of the Endpoint is the same as the Owner of the Network.  
    This is a very common model for enterprises which provide 
    equipment to employees to perform their duties.  These employees 
    are likely bound under an employment contract which outlines 
    what level of visibility the employer expects to have into the 
    employee's use of company assets and possibly activities during 
    work hours.  This contract may establish the expectation that 
    the Endpoint needs to conform to policies set forth by the 
    enterprise. 
     
    Some other environments may be in a similar situation and thus 
    find NEA technologies to be beneficial.  For example, 
    environments where the Endpoint is owned by a party (possibly 
    even the User) which has explicitly expressed a desire to 
    conform to the policies established by a network or service 
    provider in exchange for being able to access its resources.  An 
    example of this might be an independent contractor with a 
    personal laptop, working for a company imposing NEA assessment 
    policies on its employees, who may wish a similar level of 

  
Sangster, et. al.         Expires Sept 2007                  [Page 8] 
 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
    access and is willing to conform to its policies.  NEA 
    technologies may be applicable to this situation.  
     
    Conversely, some environments where NEA is not expected to be 
    applicable would be environments where the Endpoint is owned by 
    a User that has not agreed to conform to a network provider's 
    policies.  An example might include when the above contractor 
    visits any public area like the local coffee shop which offers 
    Internet access.  This coffee shop would not be expected to be 
    able to use NEA technologies to assess the Posture of the 
    contractor's laptop.  Because of the potentially invasive nature 
    of NEA technology, such an assessment could amount to an 
    invasion of privacy of the contractor. 
     
    Other environments are more difficult to determine whether NEA 
    is applicable, so the NEA WG will consider them to be out of 
    scope for consideration and specification.  In order for an 
    environment to be considered applicable for NEA, the Owner or 
    User of an Endpoint must have established a clear expectation 
    that it will comply with the policies of the Owner and operator 
    of the network.  Such an expectation likely includes a 
    willingness to disclose appropriate information necessary for 
    the network to perform compliance checks. 
     
 4. Problem Statement 
 
    NEA technology may be used for several purposes.  One use is to 
    facilitate Endpoint compliance checking against an 
    organization's security policy when an Endpoint connects to the 
    network.  Organizations often require Endpoints to run an IT-
    specified OS configuration and have certain security 
    applications enabled, e.g. anti-virus software, host intrusion 
    detection/prevention systems, personal firewalls, and patch 
    management software.  An Endpoint that is not compliant with IT 
    policy may be vulnerable to a number of known threats that might 
    exist on the network. 
     
    Without NEA technology, ensuring compliance of Endpoints to 
    corporate policy is a time-consuming and difficult task. Not all 
    Endpoints are managed by a corporation's IT organization, e.g. 
    lab assets and guest machines.  Even for assets that are 
    managed, they may not receive updates in a timely fashion 
    because they are not permanently attached to the corporate 
    network, e.g. laptops.  With NEA technology, the network is able 
    to assess an Endpoint as soon as it requests access to the 

  
Sangster, et. al.         Expires Sept 2007                  [Page 9] 
 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
    network or at any time after joining the network. This provides 
    the corporation an opportunity to check compliance of all NEA-
    capable Endpoints in a timely fashion and facilitate Endpoint 
    remediation where needed.   
     
    The decision of how to handle non-compliant Endpoints can be 
    made by the network administrator impossibly based on 
    information from other security mechanisms on the network (e.g. 
    authentication).  For example, remediation instructions or 
    warnings may be sent to the endpoint. Also, network access 
    technologies can use the NEA Assessment results to restrict or 
    deny access to an Endpoint, while allowing vulnerabilities to be 
    addressed before an Endpoint is exposed to attack. The 
    communication and representation of NEA Assessment results to 
    network access technologies on the network is out-of-scope for 
    this document.  
     
    Re-assessment is an important part of NEA technology as it 
    allows for additional Assessments of previously considered 
    compliant Endpoints to be performed.  This might become 
    necessary because network compliance policies and/or Endpoint 
    Posture can change over time.  A system initially assessed as 
    being compliant when it joined the network may no longer be in 
    compliance after changes occur.  For example, re-assessment 
    might be necessary if a User disables a security protection 
    (e.g. host firewall) required by policy or when the firewall 
    becomes non-compliant after a firewall patch is issued and 
    network policy is changed to require the patch.  
     
    Another use of NEA technology may be to verify or supplement 
    organization asset information stored in inventory databases.   
     
    NEA technology can be used to address the above problem covering 
    a range of ways of connecting to the network including (but not 
    limited to) wired and wireless LAN access, remote access via 
    IPsec[IPSEC] or SSL[TLS] VPN, or gateway access.   NEA technology 
    can also be used to check and report compliance for Endpoints when
    they try to access certain mission critical applications within an 
    enterprise by employing application triggered Assessment.  
     
 5. Reference Model 
 
    This section describes the Reference Model for Network Endpoint 
    Assessment.  This model is provided to establish a context for the 
    discussion of requirements and may not directly map to any 
    particular product or deployment architecture.  The model includes 
    the major Components of the NEA Client and Server and their

    relationships, as well as the protocols they use to communicate at 
    various levels (e.g. PA is carried by the PB protocol).  The 
    vertical lines in the model represent APIs and/or protocols between 
    Components within the NEA Client or Server.  These interfaces are 
    out of scope for standardization in the NEA WG.

                       Figure 1: NEA Reference Model 
       
    The NEA Reference model does not include any mechanisms for 
    discovery of NEA Clients and NEA Servers. It is expected that NEA 
    Clients and NEA Servers are configured with information that allow 
    them to reach each other. The specific methods of referencing the 
    configuration and establishing the communication channel are out of 
    scope for the NEA Reference Model and should be covered part of the 
    specifications of candidate protocols for the Posture Transport. 
     
 5.1 Components 
    
 5.1.1 NEA Client 

  
Sangster, et. al.         Expires Sept 2007                 [Page 11] 
 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
     
    The NEA Client is resident on an Endpoint device and comprises 
    of the following components: 
     
      o Posture Collector 
     
      o Posture Broker Client 
     
      o Posture Transport Client 
       
 5.1.1.1 Posture Collector 
     
    The Posture Collector is the Component that is responsible for 
    responding to requests for Posture information from the Posture 
    Broker Client and receiving Posture Assessment requests in 
    Request Attributes, Policy information in Policy Attributes, 
    Assessment decisions in Result Attributes and remediation 
    instructions (Remediation Attributes). A single NEA Client can 
    have several Posture Collectors capable of collecting standard 
    and/or vendor-specific Posture Attributes for particular 
    Endpoint Components. Typical examples include Posture Collectors 
    that provide information about Operating System (OS) patch 
    levels, anti-virus software, and security applications on the 
    Endpoint such as host firewall or an IDS. Posture Collectors may 
    also be capable of evaluating rules and asserting Posture 
    decisions.  
     
    Each Posture Collector will be associated with an identifier 
    that enables it to be the specified as the destination in a PA 
    Message.  The Posture Broker Client uses this identifier to 
    route Messages to this collector.  This identifier might be 
    dynamic (e.g. assigned by the Posture Broker Client upon 
    registration) or more static (e.g. provided during registration) 
    or a function of the Attribute Messages the collector desires to 
    receive (e.g. Message type subscription).  
     
    The NEA model allocates the following responsibilities to the 
    Posture Collector Component: 
     
      o Consulting with local privacy and security policies that 
        may restrict what information is allowed to be disclosed to 
        a given NEA Server. 
       
      o Receiving Request Attributes from a Posture Validator and 
        performing the local processing required to respond 
        appropriately.  This may include: 
           - Collecting associated Posture information for the 
             Component(s) on the Endpoint and returning this 
             information in Posture Attributes. 
  
Sangster, et. al.         Expires Sept 2007                 [Page 12] 
 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
           - Recognizing a recently issued (cached) Assertion 
             Attribute that might serve to prove compliance and 
             returning this attribute instead of Posture 
             information. 
            
      o Receiving Policy Attributes indicating the policies that 
        need to be met to be considered compliant.  The collector 
        would obtain the Posture information from Component(s) on 
        the Endpoint and compare the information with the provided 
        (or referenced) security policy.  The result would be sent 
        back to the Validator in Compliance Claim Attributes. 
           - If the Policy Attributes merely reference a compliance 
             policy, the collector may need to fetch or locate this 
             policy. 
            
      o Receiving Remediation Attributes containing instruction on 
        how to update the Component(s) on the Endpoint.  This could 
        require the collector to interact with the User, Owner 
        and/or a remediation server. 
       
      o Monitoring the Posture of Component(s) on the Endpoint for 
        Posture changes that require notification to the Posture 
        Broker Client. 
       
      o Providing cryptographic verification of the Attributes 
        received from the Validator and offering cryptographic 
        protection to the Attributes returned. 
    
   The above list describes the model's view of the possible 
   responsibilities of the Posture Collector.  Recall that this is 
   not a set of requirements for what each Posture Collector 
   implementation must support. 
     
 5.1.1.2 Posture Broker Client 
    
    The Posture Broker Client is a Component that is both a PA 
    Message multiplexer and a de-multiplexer. The Posture Broker 
    Client is responsible for de-multiplexing the Posture 
    information request from the NEA Server and distributing each 
    request to the corresponding Posture Collector(s).  The model 
    also allows for the Posture information request to be pre-
    provisioned on the NEA Client to improve performance by allowing 
    the NEA Client to report Posture without Request Attributes 
    being sent by the NEA Server. 
     
    The Posture Broker Client also multiplexes the responses from 
    the Posture Collector(s) and returns them to the NEA Server. The 
    Posture Broker Client constructs one or more PB Messages using 
    the PA Message(s) it obtains from the Posture Collector(s) 
  
Sangster, et. al.         Expires Sept 2007                 [Page 13] 
 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
    involved in the Assessment.  The quantity and ordering of 
    Posture Collector responses (PA Message(s)) multiplexed into the 
    PB response Message(s) can be determined by the Posture Broker 
    Client based on many factors including policy or characteristics 
    of the underlying network transport (e.g. MTU).  A particular 
    NEA Client will have one Posture Broker Client.   
     
    The NEA model allocates the following responsibilities to the 
    Posture Broker Client Component: 
     
      o Maintaining a registry of known Posture Collectors and 
        allowing for Posture Collectors to dynamically 
        register/un-register. 
     
      o Multiplexing and de-multiplexing Attribute Messages 
        between the NEA Server and the relevant Posture 
        Collectors. 
     
      o Handling Posture Change Notifications from Posture 
        Collectors and triggering re-Assessment. 
     
      o Providing User notification about the global Posture 
        decision and other User Messages sent by the NEA Server. 
     
 5.1.1.3 Posture Transport Client 
 
    The Posture Transport Client is a component responsible for 
    establishing a reliable communication channel with the NEA 
    Server for the Message Dialog between the NEA Client and NEA 
    Server. There might be more than one Posture Transport Client on 
    a particular NEA Client.  Certain Posture Transport Clients may 
    be configured with the address of the appropriate Posture 
    Transport Server to use for a particular network. 
     
    The NEA model allocates the following responsibilities to the 
    Posture Transport Client Component: 
     
      o Initiating and maintaining the communication channel to the 
        NEA Server, the Posture Transport Client hides the details 
        of the underlying carrier which could be a Layer 2 or Layer 
        3 protocol. 
     
      o Providing cryptographic protection for the Message Dialog 
        between the NEA Client and NEA Server. 
     
 5.1.2 NEA Server 
     
    The NEA Server will typically comprise of the following logical 
    components: 
  
Sangster, et. al.         Expires Sept 2007                 [Page 14] 
 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
     
      o Posture Validator 
     
      o Posture Broker Server 
     
      o Posture Transport Server 
 
    The Posture Validator can be located on a separate server from 
    the Posture Broker Server requiring the Posture Broker Server to 
    deal with both local and remote Posture Validators. 
     
 5.1.2.1 Posture Validator 
     
    A Posture Validator is a Component that is responsible for 
    assessing the Posture Attributes from the corresponding Posture 
    Collector and determining the result of the Assessment. The 
    Posture Validator performs the Posture Assessment for one or 
    more Components and creates the result and if necessary the 
    remediation instructions. The Posture Validator can request a 
    set of primitive attributes or can pass compliance policies that 
    might be evaluated by the Posture Collector. The response from 
    the Posture Collector could be a set of Attributes or a set of 
    assertions in case of NEA Client based evaluation.  
     
    Each Posture Validator will be associated with an identifier 
    that enables it to be the specified as the destination in a PA 
    Message.  The Posture Broker Server uses this identifier to 
    route Messages to this Validator. This identifier might be 
    dynamic (e.g. assigned by the Posture Broker Server upon 
    registration) or more static (e.g. provided during registration) 
    or a function of the Attribute Messages the validator desires to 
    receive (e.g. Message type subscription). 
     
    Posture Validators can be co-located on the NEA Server or can be 
    hosted on separate servers. A particular NEA Server is required 
    to handle several Posture Validators. 
     
    The NEA model allocates the following responsibilities to the 
    Posture Validator Component: 
     
      o Requesting Attributes from a Posture Collector.  The 
        request may include: 
           - Request Attributes that indicate to the Posture 
             Collector to fetch and provide Posture Attributes from 
             various Component(s) on the NEA Client. 
           - Policy Attributes that indicate to the Posture 
             Collector the policies that need to met by various 
             Component(s) for them to be considered compliant.  
            
  
Sangster, et. al.         Expires Sept 2007                 [Page 15] 
 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
      o Receiving Attributes from the Posture Collector. The 
        response from the Posture Collector may include: 
           - Posture Attributes collected from various 
             Component(s). 
           - Assertion Attributes that indicate the compliance 
             result from a prior Assessment. 
           - Compliance Claim Attributes in response to Policy 
             Attributes sent in the request. 
            
      o Assessing the Posture of the Component(s) based on the 
        various Attributes received from the Collector. 
       
      o Communicating the Posture Assessment Result to the Posture 
        Broker Server. 
       
      o Communicating the Posture Assessment Results to the Posture 
        Collector; this Attribute Message may include: 
           - Results Attribute that communicates the Posture 
             Assessment Result. 
           - Remediation Attributes that communicate the 
             Remediation Instructions to the Posture Collector. 
            
      o Monitoring out-of-band updates that trigger re-assessment 
        and require notifications to be sent to the Posture Broker 
        Server. 
       
      o Providing cryptographic protection for Attributes sent to 
        the Collector and offering cryptographic verification of 
        the Attributes received from the Collector. 
 
 5.1.2.2 Posture Broker Server 
     
    The Posture Broker Server is a Component that acts as a 
    multiplexer and a de-multiplexer for Attribute Messages. The 
    Posture Broker Client multiplexes the PA Messages, e.g. Messages 
    containing Request Attribute(s) from the relevant Posture 
    Validator(s) in one or more PB Messages and returns them to the 
    NEA Client. The Posture Broker Server de-multiplexes the PA 
    Messages received from the NEA Client and passes them to the 
    associated Posture Validators.  The quantity and ordering of 
    Posture Collector responses (PA Message(s)) multiplexed into the 
    PB response Message(s) can be determined by the Posture Broker 
    Client based on many factors including policy or characteristics 
    of the underlying network transport (e.g. MTU).  
     
    The Posture Broker Server is also responsible for computing the 
    global Posture decision based on individual Posture Assessment 
    results from the various Posture Validators, this global Posture 
    decision is sent back to the NEA Client. A particular NEA Server 
  
Sangster, et. al.         Expires Sept 2007                 [Page 16] 
 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
    will have one Posture Broker Server and this Posture Broker 
    Server will handle all the local and remote Posture Validators. 
     
    The NEA model allocates the following responsibilities to the 
    Posture Broker Server Component: 
     
      o Maintaining a registry of Posture Validators and allowing 
        for Posture Validators to register/un-register. 
     
      o Multiplexing and de-multiplexing Posture Messages between 
        the NEA Client and the relevant Posture Validators. 
     
      o Computing the global Posture decision based on Posture 
        Assessment results from the various Posture Validators. 
     
 5.1.2.3 Posture Transport Server 
  
    The Posture Transport Server is a Component responsible for 
    establishing a reliable communication channel with the NEA 
    Client for the Message Dialog between the NEA Client and NEA 
    Server. There might be more than one Posture Transport Servers 
    on a particular NEA Server. A particular Posture Transport 
    Server will typically handle requests from several Posture 
    Transport Clients and may require local configuration describing 
    how to reach the NEA Clients. 
     
    The NEA model allocates the following responsibilities to the 
    Posture Transport Server Component: 
     
      o Initiating and maintaining a communication channel with 
        potentially several NEA Clients. 
     
      o Providing cryptographic protection for the Message Dialog 
        between the NEA Client and NEA Server. 
     
 5.2 Protocols 
    
    The NEA Reference Model includes three layered protocols (PA, PB 
    and PT) that allow for the exchange of Attributes across the 
    different sets of Components on the network.  While these protocols 
    are intended to be used together to fulfill a particular role in 
    the model, they may offer overlapping functionality.  For example, 
    each protocol should be capable of protecting its information from 
    attack (see section 8.2 for more information). 
    
 5.2.1 Posture Attribute Protocol (PA) 
     


  
Sangster, et. al.         Expires Sept 2007                 [Page 17] 
 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
    PA is a protocol that carries Attribute Messages between a 
    Posture Collector and its associated Posture Validator. The PA 
    protocol is required to handle several types of Attributes 
    including Posture Attributes, Request Attributes, Result 
    Attributes, Policy Attributes, Compliance Claim Attributes, 
    Assertion Attributes and Remediation Attributes. The PA protocol 
    also provides the requisite encoding and cryptographic 
    protection for the Posture Attributes. 
     
 5.2.2 Posture Broker Protocol  (PB) 
     
    PB is a protocol that carries aggregate Attribute Messages 
    between the requested Posture Collectors on the NEA Client and 
    the corresponding Posture Validators on the NEA Server involved 
    in a particular Assessment.  The PB protocol creates and manages 
    a Session allowing for Message Dialogs for every Assessment. 
    This PB Session is then used to bind multiple Posture Attribute 
    requests and responses from the different Posture Collectors and 
    Posture Validators involved in a particular Assessment. The PB 
    protocol may also carry the global Posture decision in the 
    Result Attribute from the Posture Broker Server to the Posture 
    Broker Client. 
     
 5.2.3 Posture Transport Protocol (PT) 
     
    PT is a transport protocol between the NEA Client and the NEA 
    Server responsible for carrying the Messages generated by the PB 
    protocol. The PT protocol(s) must be capable of transporting 
    Messages for Assessment during network connection request or 
    after network connectivity has been established. It is 
    conceivable that certain candidate PT protocols are capable of 
    transporting Messages both during network connection request and 
    after network connectivity has been established, but this isn't 
    a mandatory requirement for all candidate PT protocols.  Should 
    the NEA WG select a PT protocol capable of operating only during 
    one time horizon, the WG should select an additional one so that 
    both horizons could be possible. 
     
    The PT protocol provides reliable Message delivery, mutual 
    authentication and cryptographic protection for the PB Messages. 
     
 5.3 Attributes 
     
    The PA protocol is responsible for the exchange of Attributes 
    between a Posture Collector and Posture Validator.  Attributes are 
    effectively the reserved word "nouns" of the Posture Assessment.  
    The NEA Server is only able to ask for information that has a 
    corresponding Attribute, thus bounding what type of Posture can be

 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
    obtained.  The NEA WG will define a common (standard) set of 
    Attributes that are expected to be supported by all Posture 
    Collectors, but outside this set Posture Collectors may support 
    additional vendor-specific attributes.   
     
    As discussed in the Use Cases section below, depending on the 
    deployment scenario, different types of Attributes may be used.  
    The Attribute classes defined in this specification may be merged 
    when the NEA WG defines the name space and schema for each 
    Attribute class, but for now this specification recognizes their 
    distinct roles. This section summarizes the purpose of each class 
    of Attribute and how they are generated. 
     
 5.3.1 Attributes Normally Sent by NEA Client: 
 
      o Posture Attributes - Attributes and values sent to report 
        information about a particular aspect (based on semantic of 
        the Attribute) of the system.  These Attributes are typically 
        sent in response to Request Attributes from the NEA Server.  
        For example a set of Posture Attributes might describe the 
        status of the firewall (e.g. If running, Vendor, Version).  
        The NEA Server would base its decision on comparing this type 
        of attribute against policy. 
       
      o Assertion Attributes - Attributes claiming recent prior 
        compliance to policy in hopes of avoiding a re-assessment.  
        These attributes might consist of NEA Server provided 
        attributes (state) describing a prior evaluation (e.g. opaque 
        to Endpoint, signed, time stamped items stating specific 
        results) or might consist of NEA Client identity information 
        used by the NEA Server to locate state about prior decisions 
        (e.g. system-bound cookie).  These might be returned in lieu 
        of or addition to Posture Attributes. 
       
      o Compliance Claim Attributes - Attributes claiming compliance 
        with a particular policy provided by the NEA Server (in Policy 
        Attributes). 
 
 5.3.2 Attributes Normally Sent by NEA Server: 
 
      o Request Attributes - Attributes which define the specific 
        Posture information desired by the NEA Server.  These 
        attributes might effectively form a template that the Posture 
        Collector fills in (subject to local policy restrictions) with 
        the specific value corresponding to each Attribute.  The 
        resulting Attributes are typically Posture or Assertion 
        Attributes from the NEA Client.

 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
      o Policy Attributes - Attributes including the NEA Server's
        network access policies that the Endpoint must meet.  These 
        Attributes are normally sent when the Endpoint is empowered to 
        merely provide the NEA Server with a compliance claim (in 
        Compliance Claim Attributes) without providing Posture 
        Attributes. 
       
      o Result Attributes - Attributes that contain the decisions of 
        the Posture Validators and/or Posture Broker Server.  The 
        level of detail provided may vary from which individual 
        Attributes were compliant or not thru just the global 
        decision. 
       
      o Remediation Attributes - Attributes that describe to the NEA 
        Client and its User how to update the Endpoint to become 
        compliant with the NEA Server policies.  These Attributes are 
        sent when the global decision was that the Endpoint is not 
        currently compliant.  Remediation and Result Attributes may 
        both exist within an NEA Server Attribute Message. 
 
 6. Use Cases  
 
    This section discusses use cases with intent to describe and 
    collectively bound the NEA problem space under consideration. 
    The use cases provide a context and general rationale for the 
    defined requirements.  In order to ease understanding of each 
    use case and how it maps to the reference model, each use case 
    will be accompanied by a simple example and a discussion of how 
    this example relates to the NEA protocols.  It should be 
    emphasized that the provided examples are not intended to 
    indicate the only approach to addressing the use case but rather 
    are included to ease understanding of how the flows might occur 
    and require support from the NEA protocols. 
      
    We broadly classify the use cases into two categories each with 
    their own set of trigger events: 
      o Initial Assessment - evaluation of the Posture of an 
        Endpoint that has not recently been assessed and thus is 
        not in possession of any valid proof that it should be 
        considered compliant.  This might be triggered by a request 
        to join a network, request to use a service or a desire to 
        understand the Posture of a system. 
       
      o Re-assessment - evaluation of the Posture of an endpoint 
        that has previously been assessed.  This could occur for a 
        variety of reasons including the NEA Client or Server 
        recognizing an occurrence affecting the endpoint which

 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
        might raise its risk level.   This could be as simple as it 
        having been a long time since its last re-assessment. 
     
 6.1 Initial Assessment 
    
    An initial Assessment occurs when a NEA Client or Server event 
    occurs that causes the evaluation of the Posture of the Endpoint 
    for the first time.  Endpoints that have been recently assessed 
    and the NEA Client or Server has maintained state (or proof) 
    that the Endpoint is compliant and therefore does not need to 
    have their Posture evaluated again do not qualify for this 
    category of use case.

    Figure 2: Illustration of NEA Initial Assessment Use case 
     
 6.1.1 Triggered by Network Connection Request 
    
    This use case focuses on Assessments performed at the time an 
    Endpoint attempts to join a network.  This use case is particularly 
    interesting because it allows the NEA Server to evaluate the 
    Posture of an Endpoint before allowing it access to the network.  
    This approach could be used to help detect Endpoints with known 
    vulnerabilities and facilitate their repair before they are 
    admitted to the network and potentially exposed to such threats on 
    the network.

 6.1.1.1 Example 
  
    An IT employee returning from vacation boots his office desktop 
    computer which generates a request to join the wired enterprise 
    network.  The network's security policy requires the system to 
    provide Posture information in order to determine whether the 
    desktop's security features are enabled and up to date.  The 
    desktop sends its patch, firewall and anti-virus Posture 
    information.  The network determines that the system is lacking 
    a recent security patch designed to fix a serious vulnerability 
    and places the system on a restricted access network.  The 
    desktop follows the network provided remediation instructions to 
    download and install the necessary patch.  Later, the desktop 
    requests again to join the network and this time is allowed on 
    the enterprise network after a full Assessment. 
     
 6.1.1.2 Possible flows and Protocol Usage 
  
    The following describes the Message flows through the NEA Reference 
    Model for the described example: 
     
     1. The IT employee's desktop computer connects to the network 
        through an access gateway in the wired enterprise network. 
     2. The Posture Broker Server on the NEA Server is notified of 
        the request to join the wired network. 
     3. Based upon compliance policy the Posture Broker Server 
        contacts the OS Patch, Firewall and Anti-Virus Posture 
        Validators to request the necessary Posture.  Each Posture 
        Validator creates a PA Message containing the desired 
        Request Attributes for the desktop system. 
     4. The Posture Broker Server aggregates the Request Attributes 
        from the Posture Validators and sends them to the NEA Client 
        on the desktop using the Posture Transport Server. 
     5. The Posture Transport Client receives the Message from the 
        NEA Server and passes it to the Posture Broker Client for 
        Message delivery. 
     6. The Posture Broker Client de-multiplexes the PB Message and 
        delivers Request Attributes to the Firewall, OS Patch and 
        Anti-Virus Posture Collectors.  
     7. Each Posture Collector involved consults local privacy 
        policy to determine what information is allowed to be 
        disclosed and then returns the requested Posture Attributes 
        that are authorized in a PA Message to the Posture Broker 
        Client. 
     8. The Posture Broker Client aggregates these into a single PB 
        Message and sends it to the Posture Broker Server using the 
        Posture Transport Client to Server Session. 

  
Sangster, et. al.         Expires Sept 2007                 [Page 22] 
 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
     9. The Posture Transport Server provides the PB Message to the 
        Posture Broker Server which de-multiplexes the Message and 
        sends the appropriate Posture Attributes to the 
        corresponding Posture Validator. 
    10. Each Posture Validator compares the contents of the Posture 
        Attribute Message it receives with the expected values 
        defined in its policy. 
    11. The Anti-Virus and Firewall Posture Validators return Result 
        Attributes stating it's compliant to the Posture Broker 
        Server, but the OS Patch Posture Validator returns non-
        compliant and a PA Message with Result and Remediation 
        Attributes. 
    12. The Posture Broker Server sends the Result and Remediation 
        Attributes in a PB Message to the Posture Broker Client 
    13. The Posture Broker Client delivers the PA Message containing 
        Result and Remediation Attributes to the OS Patch Posture 
        Collector which interacts with the User to download and 
        install the needed patches. 
    14. Upon completion, the above steps 1-10 are repeated 
        (triggered by the NEA Client again requesting network 
        access). 
    15. This time the OS Patch Posture Validator (step 11) returns a 
        success status and the Posture Broker Server returns a 
        successful Result Attribute in a PB Message indicating a 
        global success. 
    16. The Posture Broker Client receives the successful Result 
        Attribute and the IT employee's desktop is now on the 
        network. 
 
 6.1.1.3 Impact on Requirements 
 
    The following are several different aspects of the use case example 
    that potentially need to be factored into the requirements. 
     
      o Posture Assessment before Endpoint allowed on network 
      o Endpoint sends Posture Attributes 
      o NEA Server sends Remediation Attributes 
      o NEA Client causes a re-assessment to join network after 
        remediation 
       
 6.1.2 Triggered by Request for Network Service 
    
    In this use-case, the Endpoint was allowed access to the network 
    without a NEA Posture validation.  Now the Endpoint is 
    requesting use of a protected resource or service which results 
    in the need for an Assessment.  There are a variety of possible 
    resources or network services that could be involved with this 
    use case (e.g. critical application server seeking tighter 
    security assurances of the accessing Endpoints).

 6.1.2.1 Example 
     
    The CEO of a small company working from home wishes to establish 
    a VPN connection into the office to read e-mail.  The CEO is 
    already on the home IP-based network which did not perform an 
    initial Assessment.  When the VPN service request reaches the 
    company's gateway, it wishes some assurance the CEO's system is 
    virus protected before allowing access to the company network.  
    The gateway's policies require the system be running anti-virus 
    that has up to date signatures, but does not wish to expose 
    details (potentially personal in nature) of what is running on 
    the system to the network.  The gateway sends its specific 
    policy on allowable anti-virus products and versions to the 
    CEO's system and inquires as to whether it is compliant.  The 
    CEO's system assesses the anti-virus software and determines it 
    meets the request policy, thus it sends a Message claiming it is 
    compliant.  The gateway decides to trust the claim and allow the 
    system on the network. 
     
 6.1.2.2 Possible flows and Protocol Usage 
 
    The following describes the Message flows through the NEA Reference 
    Model for the remote User using a VPN to access the enterprise 
    network example: 
     
    1. CEO's computer initiates a remote access request to the VPN 
       gateway via his home network. 
    2. The VPN gateway triggers an authentication exchange with the 
       Endpoint. The protocol that carries this exchange does 
       double duty by also carrying the Posture Transport protocol. 
    3. The VPN gateway notifies the Posture Transport Server that a 
       new VPN session has been requested which triggers the 
       Posture Broker Server to initiate an NEA assessment. 
    4. The Posture Broker Server policy requires that Anti-Virus be 
       checked so it contacts the Anti-Virus Posture Validator. 
    5. Since in this case the Anti-Virus Posture Validator policy 
       trusts the NEA Client to perform the assessment it creates a 
       PA Message containing Policy Attributes including the most 
       recent Posture values describing the required Anti-Virus 
       policy that the CEO's computer must meet. 
    6. The Posture Broker Server assembles the PB protocol Message 
       containing the Policy Attributes, and forwards them to the 
       Posture Broker Client on the Endpoint over the PT protocol. 
    7. The gateway forwards the PB Message to the Posture Transport 
       Client in the NEA Client, which passes the Message to its 
       Posture Broker Client.

 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
    8. The Posture Broker Client extracts the PA Message from the 
       PB Message and delivers it to the Anti-Virus Posture 
       Collector for processing. 
    9. The Anti-Virus Posture Collector finds Policy Attributes 
       (instead of the normal Request Attributes) so is empowered 
       to make a claim of compliance with respect to the included 
       (or referenced) policy. 
    10. The Anti-Virus Posture Collector obtains information about 
       the running Anti-Virus software and compares this 
       information with the provided Policy Attributes.   
    11. In this case, it determines the CEO's system is compliant 
       with the policy and creates a PA Message containing 
       Compliance Claim Attribute(s) describing the compliance.  
       The PA Message is returned to the Posture Broker Client. 
    12. The Posture Broker Client takes the Compliance Claims 
       Attributes from the Posture Collector, assembles a PB 
       protocol Message, and forwards it to NEA Server, via the 
       gateway, over the PT protocol. 
    13. The gateway in turn forwards the PT protocol Messages to the 
       Posture Transport Server on the NEA Server. 
    14. The Posture Broker Server de-multiplexes the Compliance 
       Claims Attributes and delivers them to the Anti-Virus 
       Posture Validator. The Posture Validator can return Result 
       Attributes indicating compliance status and, if required, 
       Remediation Attributes to the Posture Broker Server.  In 
       this example, the Anti-Virus Posture Validator trusts the 
       claims that the CEO's system is compliant so creates a PA 
       Message containing a Result Attribute stating the system is 
       compliant and returns a successful Posture Assessment 
       Decision. 
    15. The Posture Broker Server creates a PB Message containing 
       the PA Message and includes a successful global compliance 
       decision, and returns it and specific Result Messages to the 
       NEA Client via the PB protocol. 
    16. The gateway is informed about the compliance status using 
       the PT protocol or other protocols, so that it can take the 
       appropriate enforcement action if required.  The VPN 
       authentication process continues, in this case over the same 
       physical protocol as used for PT. 
    17. Upon successful VPN authentication appropriate enforcement 
       policies are applied.  The gateway allows normal access to 
       an Endpoint that is in compliance. 
    
 6.1.2.3 Impact on Requirements 
  
    The following are several different aspects of the use case example 
    that potentially need to be factored into the requirements.

      o Posture Assessment after Endpoint on network, triggered by 
        service request 
      o NEA Server requests only anti-virus Posture 
      o Endpoint sends Compliance Claim Attributes rather than Posture 
        Attributes 
      o NEA Server decision based only on Compliance Attributes (no 
        Posture Attributes sent) 
     
 6.1.3 Triggered by Endpoint 
 
    This use case highlights that an Endpoint (possibly caused by a 
    User) may wish to trigger an Assessment of its Posture to 
    determine whether its security protective mechanisms are running 
    and up to date. 
     
 6.1.3.1 Example 
     
    A student goes to the terminal room to work on a project.  The 
    terminal room contains shared systems owned by the school that 
    are on the network.  These systems have been previously used by 
    other students so their security Posture is unknown.  The 
    student wishes to check whether a system is currently in 
    compliance with the school's security policies prior to doing 
    work, so requests a Posture Assessment.  The network performs an 
    Initial Assessment of the system and determines it's compliant 
    but the anti-virus protection is not in use.  The student 
    receives an advisory response indicating the system's anti-virus 
    software is turned off but that otherwise it complies with the 
    school's policy.  The student turns on the anti-virus software, 
    initiates a scan and upon completion decides to trust the system 
    with her work. 
     
 6.1.3.2 Possible flows and Protocol Usage 
    
   The following describes the Message flows through the NEA Reference 
   Model for the student using a terminal room shared system example: 
    
    1. Student triggers the Posture Broker Client on the computer 
       system in the terminal room to initiate a Posture 
       Assessment. 
    2. The Posture Broker Client establishes a Session with the 
       Posture Broker Server which causes an assessment to be 
       triggered. 
    3. The Posture Transport Client establishes the transport 
       channel to the Posture Transport Server causing a new 
       protocol context exchange to be initiated. 
    4. The Posture Broker Server detects the new Session and 
       consults policy to determine which Posture Validators to 
       involve in the assessment.  The Posture Broker Server

 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
       contacts several Posture Validators including the Anti-Virus 
       Posture Validator. 
    5. The Posture Validators involved create PA Messages 
       containing Request Attributes for information desired about 
       the terminal room computer based on the school's security 
       policy. 
    6. The Posture Broker Server assembles a PB Message including 
       each of the PA Messages from the Posture Validators. 
    7. The Posture Transport Server sends the PB Message to the 
       Posture Transport Client where it is passed on to the 
       Posture Broker Client. 
    8. The Posture Broker Client on the student's computer de-
       multiplexes the PA Message and delivers them to the 
       corresponding Posture Collectors. 
    9. The Posture Collectors consult privacy policy to decide what 
       information to share with the Server.  If allowable, the 
       collectors each return a PA Message containing Posture 
       Attributes to the Posture Broker Client. 
    10. The Posture Broker Client aggregates the returned PA 
       Messages into a PB Message and hands it to the Posture 
       Transport Client for transmission to the Posture Transport 
       Server. 
    11. The Posture Broker Server separates and distributes the 
       Posture Collector PA Messages to the associated Posture 
       Validators. 
    12. The Posture Validators determine whether the Posture 
       Attributes included in the PA Message are compliant with 
       their specific policies and returns a Posture Assessment 
       Decision to the Posture Broker Server. The anti-virus 
       Posture Validator returns a non-compliant decision because 
       the Anti-Virus software is not running.  In case the User 
       wishes to activate the Anti-Virus software, the Validator 
       creates Remediation Attributes.   
    13. The Posture Broker Server determines the global compliance 
       decision based on each Validator's assessment decision and 
       sends Result Attributes containing the global decision and 
       the Anti-Virus's Remediation Attributes.  In this case the 
       Result Attribute contains a compliant decision (despite the 
       single remediation attributes) because the Posture Broker 
       Server policy allowed for the Anti-Virus to not be running 
       as long as the system was properly patched and running a 
       Firewall (which were the case according to the other Posture 
       Validators).  This information is included in a PB Message. 
    14. The Posture Transport Server sends the PB Message to the 
       Posture Transport Client which provides the Message to the 
       Posture Broker Client. 
    15. The Posture Broker Client on the student's computer examines 
       the Result Attribute's global decision and reports to the

       Student that the system was deemed to be compliant, but that 
       an advisory was included. 
    16. The Posture Broker Client provides the Remediation 
       Attributes to the Anti-Virus Posture Collector which 
       interacts with the User to explain how to turn on Anti-Virus 
       to improve the local protections. 
    17. The student turns on the Anti-Virus software and on 
       completion steps 1-10 are repeated. 
    18. This time the Anti-Virus Posture Validator returns a success 
       status and the Posture Broker Server returns a successful 
       Result Attribute in a PB Message indicating a global 
       success. 
    19. The Posture Broker Client receives the successful Result 
       Attribute on the student's computer and the student now uses 
       the computer for his/her assignment. 
     
 6.1.3.3 Impact on Requirements 
  
    The following are several different aspects of the use case example 
    that potentially need to be factored into the requirements. 
  
      o Voluntary, Endpoint requested Initial Assessment 
      o Successful (compliant) Result Attribute with an advisory 
        Remediation Attribute. 
    
 6.2 Posture Re-Assessment 
     
    Re-assessment(s) of Endpoints can happen anytime after being 
    admitted to the network after a successful initial NEA 
    Assessment. These may be event-based such as driven by Posture 
    changes detected by the NEA Client or changes detected by 
    network infrastructure such as detection of suspicious behavior 
    or network policy updates. 
     
    They may also be periodic (timer-driven) to re-assess the health 
    of the Endpoint.

    Figure 3: Illustration of NEA Posture Re-assessment Use case 
     
 6.2.1 Triggered by NEA Client  
    
    This use case allows for software on the Endpoint or a User to 
    determine that a re-assessment of the system is required.  There 
    are a variety of reasons why such a re-assessment might be 
    beneficial including: changes in its previously reported Posture, 
    detection of potentially suspicious behavior or even to enable the 
    system to periodically poll the network to assess its condition 
    relative to the latest policies. 
 
 6.2.1.1 Example 
     
    The desktops within a company's HR department have a history of 
    poor security practices and eventual compromise.  The HR 
    department administrator decides to deploy software on each 
    desktop to monitor the use of security protective mechanisms to 
    assure their use.  One day, an HR person accidentally turns off 
    the desktop firewall.  The monitoring process detects the lack 
    of a firewall and contacts the NEA Server to request a re-
    Assessment of the firewall compliance.  The NEA Server returns a 
    decision that the firewall must be re-activated to stay on the 
    network.  The NEA Client explains the decision to the User and 
    how to re-activate the firewall.  The HR person re-starts the 
    firewall and initiates a request to re-join the network. 
     
 6.2.1.2 Possible Flows & Protocol Usage 
  
    The following describes the Message flows through the NEA Reference 
    Model for the HR department example: 
 
    1. The Desktop Monitoring Software which typically might act as 
       a Posture Collector triggers the Posture Broker Client to 
       initiate a Posture Re-assessment. This PB Message contains a

 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
       PA Message with the appropriate Posture Attribute indicating 
       the disabled desktop firewall. 
    2. The Posture Broker Client sends the PB Message to the 
       Posture Broker Server. The Posture Broker Client will create 
       a new session for the assessment. 
    3. The Posture Transport Client sends the PB Message to the 
       Posture Transport Server over the PT protocol. 
    4. The Posture Broker Server receives the PB Message and 
       forwards the Posture Attributes Message to the Firewall 
       Posture Validator responsible for handling Firewall related 
       Posture Attribute(s). 
    5. The Firewall Posture Validator processes the new value(s) of 
       the Posture Attribute(s) and determines that the Endpoint is 
       no longer compliant.  
    6. The Posture Validator generates a PA Message that includes a 
       Result Attribute with the Posture Assessment Decision set to 
       non-compliant and Remediation Attributes indicating how to 
       re-activate the firewall. 
    7. The Posture Validator communicates the PA Message with the 
       Posture Assessment Result to the Posture Broker Server and 
       instructs it to respond back to the NEA Client. 
    8. The Posture Broker Server generates a PB Message with the 
       Global Posture Assessment Decision and PA Message from the 
       Firewall Posture Validator. 
    9. The Posture Transport Server transports the PB Message to 
       the Posture Transport Client where it is passed to the 
       Posture Broker Client. 
    10. The Posture Broker Client processes the Result Attribute 
       received from the NEA Server and displays non-compliance 
       Messages to the end User. 
    11. The Posture Broker Client forwards the PA Message to the 
       Firewall Posture Collector; the Posture Collector guides the end 
       User with instructions to be compliant which includes enabling 
       the Desktop Firewall.  
    12. The end User will be prompted to initiate a Re-assessment after 
       completing the Remediation. 
    13. Upon completion of the remediation, the NEA Client re-initiates 
       a request for re-assessment and steps 1-4 are repeated.  This 
       time the Firewall Posture Validator determines the Endpoint is 
       compliant and returns a successful Posture Assessment Decision. 
    14. The successful Posture Broker Server generates a PB Message with 
       a Global Posture Assessment of compliant and returns this to the 
       NEA Client. 
    
 6.2.1.3 Impact on Requirements 
  
    The following are several different aspects of the use case example 
    that potentially need to be factored into the requirements.

       o NEA Server requests specific firewall-oriented Posture 
         Attributes 
       o NEA Client (firewall Posture Collector) interact with User to 
         fix problem 
    
 6.2.2 Triggered by NEA Server  
    
    In many cases, especially for re-assessment, the NEA Server may 
    initiate specific or complete re-assessment of one or more Endpoints 
    triggered by: 
    
       o Time (periodic) 
       o Event occurrence 
 
 6.2.2.1 Example 
  
    An enterprise requires employees on the network to always stay 
    up to date with security critical operating system patches.  A 
    marketing employee joins the network and performs an Initial 
    Assessment.  The Assessment determines the employee's laptop is 
    compliant.  Several hours later, a major operating system vendor 
    releases a set of patches preventing a serious vulnerability 
    that is being exploited on the Internet.   
    
    The enterprise administrators make available the patches and 
    change the network policy to require it to be installed by 5PM. 
    This policy change causes the NEA Server to request a re-
    assessment to determine what Endpoints are impacted and lacking 
    the patches.  The marketing employee's laptop is re-assessed and 
    determined to need the patches.  A remediation advisory is sent 
    and presented to the employee how to obtain the patch and that 
    it must be installed by 5PM.  The marketing employee immediately 
    downloads and installs the patch and obtains an assertion that 
    the patches are now installed. 
    
    At 5PM the enterprise performs another re-assessment of all 
    impacted Endpoints to determine if they are now in compliance.  
    The marketing employee's laptop is re-assessed and presents the 
    assertion that it has the patches installed and thus is allowed 
    to remain on the network. 
 
 6.2.2.2 Possible Flows and Protocol Usage 
  
    The following describes the Message flows through the NEA Reference 
    Model for the above example:

 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
    1. Marketing employee joins network and completes an initial 
       Assessment resulting in a compliant decision. 
    2. The Enterprise Administrator configures an OS Patch policy 
       for indicating that recent patches are required on all 
       Endpoints by 5PM to prevent serious vulnerabilities. 
    3. The NEA Server's OS Patch Posture Validator become aware of 
       this policy change and creates a PA Message containing a 
       Request Attributes for information about OS patches in use 
       and triggers the Posture Broker Server to initiate a Posture 
       Re-Assessment of all Endpoints connected to the network. 
    4. The Posture Broker creates a PB Message that includes the PA 
       Message that contains the set of Request Attribute(s) that 
       are related to OS patch versions. 
    5. The Posture Broker Server establishes a session with each 
       available NEA Client. The rest of the flow focuses on the 
       exchanges between the NEA Server and one NEA Client; the NEA 
       Server will engage in such a Message Dialog with each 
       available NEA Client. 
    6. The Posture Broker Server sends the PB Message to the 
       Posture Broker Client. 
    7. The Posture Transport Server carries the PB Message to the 
       Posture Transport Client over the PT protocol. 
    8. The Posture Broker Client receives the PB Message and 
       forwards the PA Message to the appropriate Posture Collector 
       responsible for handling OS Patch Request Attribute(s). 
    9. The OS Patch Posture Collector determines the OS patches 
       present on the Endpoint and if authorized by its disclosure 
       policy accumulates the value(s) for each Posture Attribute 
       requested by the Posture Validator. 
    10. The OS Patch Posture Collector constructs a PA Message and 
       includes the authorized Posture Attributes accumulated about 
       the OS patches. 
    11. The Posture Collector instructs the Posture Broker Client to 
       respond back to the NEA Server with the PA Message. 
    12. The Posture Broker Client sends a PB Message that includes 
       the OS Patch PA Message. 
    13. The Posture Transport Client transports the PB Message to 
       the Posture Transport Server where it is passed to the 
       Posture Broker Server. 
    14. The Posture Broker Server receives the PB Message and delivers 
       the PA Message to the OS Patch Posture Validator. 
    15. The OS Patch Posture Validator extracts the Posture 
       Attribute(s) from the PA Message and uses the values to 
       determine whether the Endpoint is compliant with the new 
       policy. The Posture Validator determines that the Endpoint 
       is not compliant since it does not have the new OS patches 
       installed. 
    16. The Posture Validator generates a PA Message that includes a 
       Result Attribute with the Posture Assessment Decision set to

       non-compliant and appropriate Remediation Attributes to 
       enable the Endpoint to download the required OS patches. 
    17. The Posture Validator communicates the Posture Assessment 
       Result to the Posture Broker Server and instructs the 
       Posture Broker to respond back to the NEA Client with the 
       Posture Attribute Message. 
    18. The Posture Broker Server generates a Global Posture 
       Assessment Decision and sends a PB Message with the Result 
       Attribute and Posture Attribute Message. 
    19. The Posture Transport Server transports the PB Message to 
       the Posture Transport Client where it is passed to the 
       Posture Broker Client. 
    20. The Posture Broker Client processes the Result Attribute 
       received from the NEA Server and displays the non-compliance 
       Messages to the User. 
    21. The Posture Broker Client forwards the PA Message to the OS 
       Patch Posture Collector; the Posture Collector guides the User 
       with instructions on how to become compliant that includes 
       downloading the appropriate OS patches to prevent the 
       vulnerability.  
    22. The marketing employee installs the required patches and how is 
       in compliance. 
    23. The NEA Client triggers a re-assessment of the OS Patches which 
       causes a repeat of many of the steps above.  This time step 15 
       determines the marketing employee's laptop is compliant and 
       returns re-usable (signed and dated) Assertion Attributes in the 
       PA Message instead of Remediation Attributes as before. 
    24. This time when the OS Patch Posture Collector receives the PA 
       Message that contains Assertion Attributes which is caches for 
       future use. 
    25. Later at 5PM, the NEA Server triggers a Re-assessment to 
       determine compliance to the patch advisory.  When the OS Patch 
       Posture Collector receives the Request Attributes (like in step 
       9-10 above) it will return Assertion Attributes (instead of 
       Posture Attributes) to indicate that the patches have been 
       installed instead of engaging in the entire assessment process. 
    26. When the OS Patch Posture Validator receives the PA Message 
       containing the Assertion Attributes it is able to determine that 
       they are authentic and returns a Posture Assessment Decision of 
       compliant thus allowing the laptop to remain on the network. 
    
 6.2.2.3 Impact on Requirements 
  
    The following are several different aspects of the use case example 
    that potentially need to be factored into the requirements. 
  
       o Server initiated re-assessment required due to urgent patch 
         availability

       o NEA Client submits Assertion Attributes instead of Posture 
         that patch is installed 
       o NEA Server capable of recognizing Assertion Attributes are 
         sufficient instead of Posture Attributes 
       
 7. Requirements 
 
    This section describes the requirements that will be used by the 
    NEA WG to assess and compare candidate protocols for PA, PB and 
    PT.  These requirements frequently express features that a 
    candidate protocol must be capable of offering so that a 
    Deployer can decide to make use of that feature.  This section 
    does not state requirements about what features of each protocol 
    must be used during a deployment. 
     
    For example, a requirement may exist for cryptographic security 
    protections to be available from each protocol but this does not 
    require that a Deployer make use of all or even any of them 
    should they deem their environment to offer other protections 
    which are sufficient. 
 
 7.1 Common Protocol Requirements 
 
    The following are the common requirements that apply to the PA, 
    PB and PT protocols in NEA conceptual architecture:  
         
      C-1 NEA protocols MUST be capable of performing a multiple 
          Message Dialog between the NEA Client and NEA Server.  
          This allows for Assessment models that require more than 
          one round trip to complete the Assessment. This also 
          allows for updates to already reported Posture 
          information. These updates allow for detection of recent 
          changes in the Endpoint state (e.g. possibly due to a 
          remediation).  
      
      C-2 NEA protocols MUST allow Posture Assessment to occur 
          before or after the Endpoint has established network 
          connectivity. The support for both time periods will 
          facilitate multiple deployment models including those that 
          leverage the network access technology to restrict access 
          based on Posture.  Should the WG select a protocol used 
          only during one time period, this requirement would cause 
          the selection of an additional protocol with coverage of 
          the other time period.  
  
Sangster, et. al.         Expires Sept 2007                 [Page 34] 
 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
      
      C-3 NEA protocols MUST provide a way for both the NEA Client 
          and the NEA Server to initiate a Posture re-assessment 
          request as needed.   
      
      C-4 NEA protocols MUST provide protection against active and 
          passive attacks by intermediaries including protection to 
          prevent replay based attacks. 
      
      C-5 The PA and PB protocols defined by NEA MUST be agnostic of 
          the transport i.e. PT protocol. For example, the PB 
          protocol must provide a transport independent interface 
          allowing the PA protocol to operate without change across 
          a variety of network protocol environments (e.g. 
          EAP/802.1X, PANA, and IKE/IPsec).   
      
      C-6 The selection process for NEA protocols MUST evaluate and 
          prefer the reuse of existing open standards that meet the 
          requirements before defining new ones.  The goal of NEA is 
          not to create additional alternative protocols where 
          acceptable solutions already exist.  
      
      C-7 NEA protocols MUST be highly scalable; the protocols MUST 
          support many Posture Collectors on a large number of NEA 
          Clients to be assessed by numerous Posture Validators 
          residing on multiple NEA Servers.  
      
      C-8 The protocols MUST support efficient transport of a large 
          number of Attributes Messages between the NEA Client and 
          the NEA Server. 
      
      C-9 The protocols MUST support deployments that have large 
          numbers of compliance policies. 
 
     C-10 The protocols MUST allow for Assessment modes that can 
          reduce the amount information to be exchanged between the 
          NEA Client and Server to complete an assessment.  
  
 7.2 Posture Attribute (PA) Protocol Requirements 
 
    The Posture Attribute (PA) protocol defines the transport and data 
    model to carry Posture and validation information between a 
    particular Posture Collector associated with the NEA Client and a 
  
Sangster, et. al.         Expires Sept 2007                 [Page 35] 
 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
    Posture Validator associated with an NEA Server. The PA protocol 
    carries collections of standard attributes and vendor-specific 
    attributes. The PA protocol itself is carried inside the PB 
    protocol. 
     
    The following requirements define the desired properties that form 
    the basis for comparison and evaluation of candidate PA protocols. 
    These requirements do not mandate the use of these properties, but 
    merely that the candidate protocols are capable of offering the 
    property if it should be needed. 
     
     PA-1 The PA protocol MUST support transport of the required 
          (standard) Attributes defined in the data model. 
      
     PA-2 The PA protocol MUST support the transport of vendor-specific 
          Attributes. 
      
     PA-3 The PA protocol MUST enable a Posture Validator to request 
          Posture, Compliance Claims, and Assertion Attributes about 
          particular Components on the NEA Client system from its peer 
          Posture Collector. 
      
     PA-4 The PA protocol MUST enable a Posture Validator to request 
          Posture, Compliance Claims, and Assertion Attributes from its 
          peer Posture Collector on more than one occasion using an 
          existing or new Session. This enables the Posture Validator 
          to reassess the Posture of a particular Component or to 
          request information about additional Component. 
      
     PA-5 The PA protocol MUST be capable of returning Results and 
          Remediation Attributes from the Posture Validator. This 
          enables the Posture Collector to learn the specific reason 
          for a failed Assessment and to aid in remediation and 
          notification of the system owner. 
      
     PA-6 The PA protocol SHOULD support expression of standard 
          Attributes to describe remediation state of Components, for 
          example, last update time or remediation server used. These 
          Attributes are used after remediation so that a Posture 
          Validator can synchronize with a Posture Collector and 
          continue remediation.

     PA-7 The PA protocol MUST support authentication, integrity, and 
          confidentiality of Attributes, results, and remediation 
          instructions sent between a Posture Collector and Posture 
          Validator. This enables end-to-end security across an NEA 
          deployment that might involve traversal of several systems. 
      
     PA-8 The PA protocol MUST be capable of carrying attributes that 
          contain binary data including encrypted content. 
      
     PA-9 String Attributes MUST support being encoded with an 
          encoding standard that supports internationalization. 
 
 7.3 Posture Broker (PB) Protocol Requirements 
 
    The PB protocol supports multiplexing of Posture Attribute Messages 
    (based on PA protocol) from multiple Posture Collectors associated 
    with a NEA Client and transmitting them to an NEA Server, where 
    they can be de-multiplexed to potentially multiple corresponding 
    Posture Validators.   
 
    The PB protocol carries the global decision made by the Posture 
    Broker Server, taking into account the results of the Posture 
    Validators involved in the Assessment, to the Posture Broker 
    Client. The PB protocol also aggregates and transports advisories 
    and notifications such as remediation instructions and patch 
    references from one or more Posture Validators.  
     
    The requirements for the PB protocol are: 
 
     PB-1 The PB protocol MUST be capable of carrying the Result 
          Attributes and, if appropriate, the Remediation Attributes 
          from the Posture Broker Server to the Posture Broker Client. 
      
     PB-2 The PB protocol MUST carry identifiers that are used by the 
          Posture Brokers to route (deliver) Messages between peer 
          Posture Collectors and Posture Validators. Such Message 
          routing should facilitate dynamic (de)registration of Posture 
          Collectors and Validators to the NEA service.  For example, a 
          dynamically registered Anti-Virus Posture Validator should be 
          able to subscribe to receive Messages from its respective 
          Anti-Virus Posture Collector on NEA Clients.

 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
     PB-3 The PB protocol MUST support creation and management of a 
          Session that can carry a Message Dialog between one or more 
          Posture Collectors and Posture Validators.  This allows each 
          party to send multiple Messages before the dialog is 
          complete.      
      
     PB-4 The PB protocol SHOULD support authentication, integrity and 
          confidentiality protection for the Attribute Messages it 
          carries between an NEA Client and Server.  This provides 
          security protection for a Message Dialog of the groupings of 
          Attribute Messages exchanged between the NEA Client and 
          Server. Such protection is orthogonal to PA protections 
          (which are end to end) and allow for simpler Posture 
          Collector and Validators be implemented, and for 
          consolidation of cryptographic operations possibly improving 
          scalability and manageability.      
      
     PB-5 The PB protocol MUST support grouping of Attribute Messages 
          to optimize transport of Messages and minimize round trips.   
    
 7.4 Posture Transport (PT) Protocol Requirements 
 
    The Posture Transport (PT) protocol carries PB protocol Messages 
    between the Posture Transport Client and the Posture Transport 
    Server. PT is responsible for providing a protected transport for 
    the PB protocol. The PT protocol may itself be transported by one 
    or more concatenated sessions using lower layer protocols, such as 
    802.1X, RADIUS, TLS, or IKE. 
     
    This section defines the requirements that candidate PT protocols 
    must be capable of supporting. 
    
     PT-1 The PT protocol SHOULD incur low overhead to accommodate us 
          on low bandwidth links 
      
     PT-2 The PT protocol SHOULD be capable of supporting a half-duplex 
          communication environment. 
      
     PT-3 The PT protocol MUST NOT attempt to interpret the contents of 
          PB Messages being transported, i.e., the data it is carrying 
          must be opaque to it. 
      
     PT-4 The PT protocol MUST be capable of protecting the integrity 
          and confidentiality of the PB Messages between the Posture

          Transport Client and the Posture Transport Server. This 
          includes protection against replay and reflection. 
      
     PT-5 The PT protocol MUST provide reliable delivery for the PB 
          protocol. This includes the ability to perform fragmentation, 
          reassembly, and detect duplicates and reorder to provide in-
          sequence delivery, as required. 
      
     PT-6 The PT protocol MUST be capable of supporting mutual 
          authentication between the Posture Transport Client and the 
          Posture Transport Server. This MAY occur by leveraging by-
          products (e.g., keys) supplied by the PB protocol 
          authentication. 
 
     PT-7 The PT protocol MUST support establishing a restricted 
          Session between the Posture Transport client and the Posture 
          Transport server prior to the NEA Client being granted 
          unrestricted network access. 
 
     PT-8 The PT protocol MUST allow either the Posture Transport 
          Client or the Posture Transport Server to initiate a 
          restricted session for use by NEA when both parties have 
          necessary network addresses established. 
      
 8. Security Considerations 
    
    This document defines the functional requirements for the PA, PB 
    and PT protocols used for Network Endpoint Assessment.  As such, it 
    does not define a specific protocol stack or set of technologies, 
    so this section will highlight security issues that may apply to 
    NEA in general or to particular aspects of the reference model's 
    components. 
 
 8.1 Trust 
    
    Network Endpoint Assessment involves assessing the Posture of 
    Endpoints entering or already on the network against compliance 
    policies to assure they are adequately protected.  Therefore, there 
    is an implied distrusting of Endpoints until there is reason to 
    believe (based on Posture information) that they are well protected 
    and can be trusted to not infect/attack other Endpoints.  On the 
    network provider side, the NEA Client normally is expected to trust 
    the network infrastructure systems not to misuse any disclosed 
    Posture information (see section 9) and any remediation 
    instructions necessary to join the network.  The NEA Client 
    normally needs to trust that the NEA Server will only request 
    information required to determine whether the Endpoint is safe to 
    access the network assets.   
  
Sangster, et. al.         Expires Sept 2007                 [Page 39] 
 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
     
    In between the NEA Client and Server exists a network that is not 
    assumed to be trustworthy.  Therefore, little about the network is 
    implicitly trusted beyond its willingness and ability to transport 
    the exchanged Messages in a timely manner.  The amount of trust 
    given to each of these parties is deployment specific.  The NEA 
    Reference Model intends to provide security mechanisms to reduce 
    the amount of trust that must be assumed by a Deployer. The 
    following sections will discuss each area in more detail. 
     
 8.1.1 Endpoint Components 
     
    For NEA to properly operate, the Endpoint needs to be trusted to 
    accurately represent the requested security Posture of the Endpoint 
    to the NEA Server.  By NEA WG charter, the NEA Reference Model does 
    not explicitly specify how to detect or prevent lying endpoints 
    that intentionally misrepresent their Posture.  Similarly, the 
    detection of malware (e.g. root kits) that are able to trick the 
    Posture Collectors into returning incorrect information is the 
    subject for research and standardization outside the IETF (e.g. 
    Trusted Computing Group) and is not specifically addressed by the 
    model.  However, if such mechanisms do come into existence, the NEA 
    Reference Model should be able to accommodate these technologies by 
    allowing them to communicate over PA to Posture Validators or work 
    orthogonally to protect the NEA Components from attack and assure 
    the ability of Posture Collectors to view the actual Posture. 
     
    Besides having to trust the integrity of the NEA Components and 
    their ability to properly collect and report Posture Attributes 
    about the Endpoint, we try to limit other assumed trust.  Most of 
    the usage models for NEA expect the Posture information to be sent 
    to the NEA Server for evaluation and decision making.  However, one 
    approach assumes more trust in the Endpoint.  This approach allows 
    for the NEA Client to receive compliance policies in Policy 
    Attributes and perform the comparison of the current Posture to the 
    policies and make a claim of compliance in Compliance Claim 
    Attributes to the NEA Server instead of providing the Posture 
    Attributes themselves.  In this case, the NEA Server must trust the 
    Endpoint's policy storage, comparison and reporting mechanisms to 
    not falsify the results of the Posture evaluation. 
     
    Generally the Endpoint should not trust network communications 
    (e.g. inbound connection requests) unless it has been specifically 
    authorized by the User or Owner defined policy.  The NEA Reference 
    Model assumes all the NEA Client components are local to the 
    Endpoint and communicate over local API or program calls.  
    Unsolicited communications originating from the network should be 
    inspected by normal security protective mechanisms (e.g. firewalls, 
    security protocols, IDS/IPS, etc).  Communications associated with 
  
Sangster, et. al.         Expires Sept 2007                 [Page 40] 
 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
    the NEA Assessment or re-assessment requires some level of trust 
    particularly when initiated by the NEA Server (re-assessment).  The 
    degree of trust can be limited by use of strong security 
    protections on the Messages as dictated by the network Deployer and 
    the Endpoint User/Owner policy. 
 
 8.1.2 Network Communications 
  
    Between the NEA Client and Server there may exist a variety of 
    types of devices to facilitate the communication path. Some of the 
    devices may serve as intermediaries (e.g. simple L2 switches) so 
    may have the opportunity to observe and change the Message Dialogs.  
     
    The intermediary devices may fall into a few major categories which 
    impact our degree of trust in their operation.  First, some 
    intermediary devices may act as Message forwarders or carriers for 
    PT (e.g. L2 switches, L3 routers, or alike).  For these devices we 
    trust them not to drop the Messages or actively DOS the NEA 
    deployment. 
     
    Second, some intermediary devices may be part of the access control 
    layer of the network and as such we trust them to enforce policies 
    including remediation isolation and access controls given to them 
    by the NEA Server.  These devices may also fill other types of 
    roles described in this section. 
     
    Third, some devices may act as a termination point or proxy for the 
    PT carrier protocol.  Frequently, it's expected that the carrier 
    protocol for PT will terminate on the NEA Client and Server so will 
    be co-resident with the PT endpoints.  If this expectation is not 
    present in a deployment, we must trust the termination device to 
    accurately proxy the PT Messages without alteration into the next 
    carrier protocol (e.g. if inner EAP method Messages are 
    transitioned from an EAP [EAP] tunnel to a RADIUS [RADIUS] 
    session). 
     
    Fourth, many networks include infrastructure such as IDS/IPS 
    devices which monitor and take corrective action when suspicious 
    behavior is observed on the network.  These devices may have a 
    relationship with the NEA Server which is not within scope for this 
    specification.  Devices trusted by the NEA Server to provide 
    security information that might affect the NEA Server's decisions 
    are trusted to operate properly and not cause the NEA Server to 
    make incorrect decisions. 
 
    Finally, other types of intermediary devices may exist on the 
    network between the NEA Client and Server which are present to 
    service other network functions beside NEA.  These devices might be 
    capable of passively eavesdropping on the network archiving 
  
Sangster, et. al.         Expires Sept 2007                 [Page 41] 
 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
    information for future purposes (e.g. replay or privacy invasion) 
    or more actively attacking the NEA protocols.  Because these 
    devices do not play a role in facilitating NEA, it's essential that 
    NEA Deployers not be forced to trust them for NEA to reliably 
    operate.  Therefore, it is required that NEA protocols offer 
    security protections to assure these devices can't steal, alter, 
    spoof or otherwise damage the reliability of the Message Dialogs. 
     
 8.1.3 NEA Server Components 
     
    The NEA Server components including systems providing (remote) 
    Posture Validation are generally trusted to enforce the specified 
    Assessment policies and are protected from compromise.  It's 
    essential that NEA Server deployments properly safeguard these 
    systems from a variety of attacks from the network and Endpoints to 
    assure their proper operation.   
     
    While we need to trust the NEA Server operation to some degree, 
    rigorous security architecture, analysis, monitoring and review 
    should assure their network footprint and internal workings are 
    protected from attack.  The network footprint would include 
    communications over the network which might be subject to attack 
    such as policy provisioning from the policy authoring systems and 
    general security and system management protocols.  Some examples of 
    internal workings include protections from malware attacking the 
    intra-NEA Component communications, Component inner workings or 
    policy stores particularly those that would change the resulting 
    decisions or enforcements.  The NEA Server needs to trust the 
    underlying carrier protocols to properly behave and safeguard the 
    exchanged Messages with the Endpoint.  The NEA Reference Model does 
    not attempt to address integrity protection of the operating system 
    or other software supporting the NEA Server. 
     
    One interesting example combines aspects of both areas, where each 
    of the NEA Server Components physically reside in different 
    systems.  This might occur when a Posture Validator (or a remote 
    backend server used by a local Posture Validator) exists on another 
    system from the Posture Broker Server.  Similarly, the Posture 
    Broker Server might exist on a separate system from the Posture 
    Transport Server.  When there is a physical separation, the 
    communications between the NEA Server components must ensure that 
    the PB Session and PA Message Dialogs are resistant to active and 
    passive attacks, in particular, guarded against eavesdropping, 
    forgery and replay.  
 
 8.2 Protection Mechanisms at Multiple Layers 
    


  
Sangster, et. al.         Expires Sept 2007                 [Page 42] 
 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
    Inherent in the requirements is a desire for NEA candidate 
    protocols throughout the Reference Model to be capable of providing 
    strong security mechanisms as dictated by the particular 
    deployment.  In some cases, these mechanisms may appear to provide 
    overlapping or redundant protections.  These apparent overlaps may 
    be used in combination to offer a defense in depth approach to 
    security.  However because of the layering of the protocols each 
    set of protections offers slightly different benefits and levels of 
    granularity.  
     
    For example, a Deployer may wish to encrypt traffic at the PT layer 
    to protect against some forms of traffic analysis or interception 
    by an eavesdropper. Additionally, the Deployer may also selectively 
    encrypt some set of Posture Attributes to achieve end to end 
    confidentiality to its peer Posture Validator.  In particular, this 
    might be desired when the Posture Validator is not co-located with 
    the PT Server so the information will traverse additional network 
    segments after the PT protections have been enforced. 
     
    Different use cases and environments for the NEA technologies will 
    likely influence the selection of the strength and security 
    mechanisms employed during an Assessment.  The goal of the NEA 
    requirements is to encourage the selection of technologies and 
    protocols that are capable of enforcing the necessary protections 
    for a wide variety of types of Assessment. 
    
 8.3 Relevant Classes of Attack 
    
    A variety of attacks are possible against the NEA protocols and 
    Assessment technologies. This section does not include a full 
    security analysis, but wishes to highlight a few attacks that 
    influenced the requirement definition and should be considered by 
    Deployers selecting use of protective mechanisms within the NEA 
    Reference Model. 
     
    As discussed, there are a variety of protective mechanisms included 
    in the requirements for candidate NEA protocols. Different use 
    cases and environments may cause Deployers to decide not to use 
    some of these mechanisms; however this should be done with an 
    understanding that the deployment may become vulnerable to some 
    classes of attack.  As always a balance of risk vs. performance, 
    usability, manageability and other factors should be taken into 
    account. 
     
    The following types of attacks are applicable to network protocols 
    defined in the Reference Model and thus should be considered by 
    Deployers.

 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
 8.3.1 Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) 
    
    MITM attacks against a network protocol exist when a third party 
    can insert itself between two communicating entities without 
    detection and gain benefit from involvement in their Message 
    Dialog.  For example, a malware infested system might wish to join 
    the network replaying Posture observed from a clean Endpoint 
    entering the network.  This might occur by the system inserting 
    itself into and actively proxying an Assessment Message Dialog. The 
    impact of the damage caused by the MITM can be limited or prevented 
    by selection of appropriate protocol protective mechanisms. 
     
    For example, the requirement for PT to be capable of supporting 
    mutual authentication prior to any Endpoint Assessment Message 
    Dialogs prevents the attacker from inserting themselves as an 
    active participant (proxy) within the communications without 
    detection (assuming attacker lacks credentials convincing either 
    party it is legitimate). Re-usable credentials should not be 
    exposed on the network to assure the MITM doesn't have a way to 
    impersonate either party.  The PT requirement for confidentiality 
    protected (encrypted) communications linked to the above 
    authentication prevent a passive MITM from eavesdropping by 
    observing the Message Dialog and keeping a record of the conformant 
    Posture values for future use.  The PT requirement for replay 
    prevention stops the passive MITM from later establishing a new 
    Session (or hijacking an existing Session) and replaying previously 
    observed Message Dialogs. 
     
 8.3.2 Message Modification 
    
    Without Message integrity protection, an attacker capable of 
    interception of a Message might be capable of modifying its 
    contents and causing an incorrect decision to be made.  For 
    example, the attacker might change the Posture Attributes to always 
    reflect incorrect values and thus prevent a compliant system from 
    joining the network.  Unless the NEA Server could detect this 
    change, the attacker could prevent admission to large numbers of 
    clean systems. Conversely, the attacker could allow malware 
    infested machine to be admitted by changing the sent Posture 
    Attributes to reflect compliant values, thus hiding the malware 
    from the Posture Validator. 
     
    In order to protect against such attacks, the PT includes a 
    requirement for strong integrity protection (e.g. including a 
    protected hash like an HMAC [HMAC] of the Message) so this change 
    would be detected.  PA includes a similar requirement to enable end 
    to end integrity protection of the Attributes extending the 
    protection all the way to the Posture Validator even if it existed 
    on another system behind the NEA Server.  
  
Sangster, et. al.         Expires Sept 2007                 [Page 44] 
 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
     
    It is important that integrity protection schemes leverage fresh 
    secret information (not known by the attacker) that is bound to the 
    authenticated Session such as an HMAC using a derived fresh secret 
    associated with the Session.  Inclusion of freshness information 
    allows the parties to protect against some forms of Message replay 
    attacks using secret information from prior Sessions. 
     
 8.3.3 Message Replay or Attribute Theft 
    
    An attacker might listen to the network recording Message Dialogs 
    or Attributes from a compliant Endpoint for later re-use to the 
    same NEA Server or just to build an inventory of software running 
    on other systems watching for known vulnerabilities.  The NEA 
    Server needs to be capable of detecting the replay of Posture 
    and/or the model must assure that the eavesdropper can not obtain 
    the information in the first place. 
     
    The cryptographic protection from disclosure of the PT, PB or PA 
    Messages prevents the passive listener from observing the exchanged 
    Messages and thus prevents theft of the information for future use.  
    However an active attacker might be able to replay the encrypted 
    Message if there is no strong link to the originating party or 
    session.  By linking the encrypted Message Dialog to the 
    authentication event and leveraging per-transaction freshness and 
    keying exchanges, this prevents a replay of the encrypted 
    transaction. 
    
 8.3.4 Other Types of Attack 
    
    This section doesn't claim to present an exhaustive list of attacks 
    against the NEA Reference Model.  Several types of attack will 
    become easier to understand and analyze once the NEA WG has created 
    specifications describing the specific selected technologies and 
    protocols to be used within NEA.  One such area is Denial of 
    Service (DoS).  At this point in time it's not practical to try to 
    define the all of the potential exposures present within the NEA 
    protocols, so such an analysis should be included in the Security 
    Considerations sections of the selected NEA protocols. 
      
    However, it's important that the NEA Server be resilient to DoS 
    attacks as an outage might affect large numbers of Endpoints 
    wishing to join or remain on the network.  The NEA Reference Model 
    expects that the underlying carrier protocols would have some 
    amount of DoS resilience and that the NEA protocols would need to 
    build upon that base with their own protections.  To help narrow 
    the window of attack by unauthenticated parties, it is envisioned 
    that NEA Servers would employ carrier protocols that enable an 
    early authentication of the requesting Endpoint as one technique 
  
Sangster, et. al.         Expires Sept 2007                 [Page 45] 
 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
    for filtering out attacks.  The PT protocol also requires support 
    of a mutual authentication that can be used in addition to (or in 
    lieu of) the carrier authentication to limit the window of 
    unauthenticated attack against the Posture assessment. 
     
    Attacks occurring after the authentication would at least come from 
    sources possessing valid credentials and could potentially be held 
    accountable.  Similarly, NEA protocols should offer strong replay 
    protection to prevent DoS based attacks based on replayed Sessions 
    and Messages.  Posture assessment should be strongly linked with 
    the carrier and/or Posture Transport authentications that occurred 
    to assure the Posture came from the authenticated party.  
    Cryptographic mechanisms and other potentially resource intensive 
    operations should be used sparingly until the validity of the 
    request can be established.  This and other resource/protocol based 
    attacks can be evaluated once the NEA technologies and their 
    cryptographic use have been selected. 
 
 9. Privacy Considerations 
 
    While there are a number of beneficial uses of the NEA 
    technology for organizations that own and operate networks 
    offering services to similarly owned Endpoints, these same 
    technologies might enhance the potential for abuse and invasion 
    of personal privacy if misused.  This section will discuss a few 
    of the potential privacy concerns raised by the deployment of 
    this technology and offer some guidance to implementers. 
     
    The NEA technology enables greater visibility into the 
    configuration of an Endpoint from the network.  Such 
    transparency enables the network to take into consideration the 
    strength of the Endpoint's security mechanisms when making 
    access control decisions to network resources.  However this 
    transparency could also be used to enforce restrictive policies 
    to the detriment of the User by limiting their choice of 
    software or prying into past or present uses of the Endpoint. 
     
    The scope of the NEA WG was limited to specify protocols 
    targeting the use cases where the Endpoints and network are 
    owned by the same party or a clear expectation of 
    disclosure/compliance has been established with the network 
    owner.  This is a familiar model for governments, institutions 
    and a wide variety of enterprises that provide Endpoints to 
    their employees to perform their jobs.  In many of these

    enterprise and they often reserve the right to audit and 
    possibly dictate the allowable uses of the device.  The NEA 
    technologies allow them to automate the inspection of the 
    contents of an Endpoint and this information may be linked to 
    the access control mechanisms on the network to limit their use 
    should they not meet minimal compliance levels.   
     
    In these environments, the level of personal privacy the 
    employee enjoys may be significantly reduced subject to local 
    laws and customs.  However, in situations where the Endpoint is 
    owned by the User or where local laws protect the rights of the 
    User even when using Endpoints owned by another party, it's 
    critical that the NEA implementation enable the User to control 
    what Endpoint information is shared with the network.  Such 
    controls imposed by the User might prevent or limit their 
    ability to access certain networks or protected resources, but 
    this must be a User choice.   
     
 9.1 Implementer Considerations 
     
    The NEA WG is not defining NEA Client policy content standards 
    nor defining requirements on aspects of an implementation 
    outside of the network protocols, however the following guidance 
    is provided to encourage privacy friendly implementations for 
    broader use than just the enterprise oriented setting described 
    above.    
     
    NEA Client implementations are encouraged to offer an opt-in 
    policy to Users prior to sharing their Endpoint's Posture 
    information.  The opt-in mechanism should be on a per-User, per-
    NEA Server basis so each User can control which networks can 
    access any Posture information on their system.  For those 
    networks that are allowed to assess the Endpoint, the User 
    should be able to specify granular restrictions on what 
    particular types and specific Attributes Posture Collectors are 
    allowed to disclose. 
     
    Requests for Attributes that are explicitly not allowed to be 
    shared should result in a User notification and/or log record so 
    the User can assess whether the service is doing something 
    undesirable or whether the User is willing to share this 
    additional information in order to gain access.  Some products 
    might consider policy-driven support for prompting the User for

 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
    authorization with a specific description of the Posture 
    information being requested prior to sending it to the NEA 
    Server. 
     
    It's envisioned that the Owner of the Endpoint is able to 
    specify disclosure policies that may override or influence the 
    User's policies of the Attributes visible to the network.  If 
    the Owner disclosure policy allows for broader Posture 
    availability than the User policy, the implementation should 
    provide a feedback mechanism to the User so they understand the 
    situation and can choose to whether to use the Endpoint in those 
    circumstances. 
     
    In such a system, it is important that the User's policy 
    authoring interface be easy to understand and clearly 
    articulates the current disclosure policy of the system 
    including any influences from the Owner policy.  Users should be 
    able to understand what Posture is available to the network and 
    the general impact of this information being known.  In order to 
    minimize the list of restrictions enumerated, use of a 
    conservative default disclosure policy such as "that which is 
    not explicitly authorized for disclosure is not allowed" might 
    make sense to avoid unintentional leakage of information.   
     
    NEA Server implementations should provide newly subscribing 
    Endpoints with a disclosure statement that clearly states: 
     
       o What information is required,  
       o How this information will be used/protected,  
       o What local privacy policies are applicable. 
       
    This information will empower subscribing Users to decide 
    whether the disclosure of this information is acceptable 
    considering local laws and customs. 
     
 9.2 Minimizing Attribute Disclosure 
    
    One important issue in the design of the NEA Reference Model and 
    protocols is enabling Endpoints to disclose minimal information 
    required to establish compliance with network policies.  There 
    are several models that could be considered as to how the 
    disclosed Attribute set is established.  Each model has benefits 

  
Sangster, et. al.         Expires Sept 2007                 [Page 48] 
 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
    and issues and these descriptions are provided to seed 
    discussion as to whether each is feasible and whether a 
    preferred approach will emerge potentially impacting the 
    protocols and general privacy of NEA.   
     
    These models assume a NEA Client resident on the Endpoint and 
    thus able to access privacy sensitive information.  If a 
    Deployer wishes to support Endpoint Assessment without a NEA 
    Client (e.g. basing Posture on network observed behaviors) this 
    could improve the privacy but may limit what information is 
    ascertainable thus impacting flexibility of NEA Server policy. 
     
    The first model is easy to implement and deploy but has privacy 
    and potentially latency and scalability implications.  This 
    approach effectively defaults the local policy to send all known 
    NEA Posture Attributes when an Assessment occurs.  While this 
    might simplify deployment, it exposes a lot of information that 
    is potentially not relevant to the security Assessment of the 
    system and may introduce privacy issues.  For example, is it 
    really important that the enterprise know whether Firefox is 
    being used on system instead of other browsers during the 
    security Posture Assessment? 
     
    The second model involves an out-of-band provisioning of the 
    disclosure policy to all Endpoints.  This model may involve the 
    enterprise establishing policy that a particular list of 
    Attributes must be provided when a NEA exchange occurs.  
    Endpoint privacy policy may filter this Attribute list, but such 
    changes could cause the Endpoint not to be given network or 
    resource access.  This model simplifies the network exchange as 
    the Endpoint always sends the filtered list of Attributes when 
    challenged by a particular network.  However this approach 
    requires an out-of-band management protocol to establish and 
    manage the NEA disclosure policies of all system. 
     
    The third model avoids the need for pre-provisioning of 
    disclosure policy by allowing the NEA Server to specifically 
    request what Attributes are required.  This is somewhat 
    analogous to the policy being provisioned during the NEA 
    exchanges so is much easier to manage.  This model allows for 
    the NEA Server to iteratively ask for Attributes based on the 
    values of prior Attributes.  Note, even in this model the NEA 
    protocols are not expected to be a general purpose query

 Internet Draft             NEA Requirements                 Mar 2007 
    language, but rather allow the NEA Server to request specific 
    Attributes as only the defined Attributes are possible to 
    request.   For example, an enterprise might ask about the OS 
    version in the initial Message Dialog and after learning the 
    system is a Linux system, ask for a different/smaller set of 
    Attributes specific to Linux then it would if the Endpoint was a 
    Windows system.  It's envisioned that this approach might 
    minimize the set of Attributes sent over the network if the 
    Assessment is of a complex system (such as trying to understand 
    what patches are missing from an OS). 
     
    In each model, the User could create a set of per-network 
    privacy filter policies enforced by the NEA Client to prevent 
    the disclosure of Attributes felt to be personal in nature or 
    not relevant to a particular network.  Such filters would 
    protect the privacy of the User but might result in the User not 
    being allowed access to the desired asset (or network) or being 
    provided limited access.
