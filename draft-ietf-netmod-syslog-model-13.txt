1.  Introduction

   Operating systems, processes and applications generate messages
   indicating their own status or the occurrence of events.  These
   messages are useful for managing and/or debugging the network and its
   services.  The BSD syslog protocol is a widely adopted protocol that
   is used for transmission and processing of the messages.

   Since each process, application and operating system was written
   somewhat independently, there is little uniformity to the content of
   syslog messages.  For this reason, no assumption is made upon the
   formatting or contents of the messages.  The protocol is simply
   designed to transport these event messages.  No acknowledgement of
   the receipt is made.

   Essentially, a syslog process receives messages (from the kernel,
   processes, applications or other syslog processes) and processes
   those.  The processing involves logging to a local file, displaying
   on console, and/or relaying to syslog processes on other machines.
   The processing is determined by the "facility" that originated the
   message and the "severity" assigned to the message by the facility.

   We are using definitions of syslog protocol from RFC 5424 [RFC5424]
   in this RFC.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   The term "originator" is defined in [RFC 5424]: an "originator"

Internet-Draft             Syslog Management                  March 2017

   generates syslog content to be carried in a message.

   The terms "relay" and "collectors" are as defined in [RFC 5424].

2.  Problem Statement

   This document defines a YANG [RFC6020] configuration data model that
   may be used to configure the syslog feature running on a system.
   YANG models can be used with network management protocols such as
   NETCONF [RFC6241] to install, manipulate, and delete the
   configuration of network devices.

   The data model makes use of the YANG "feature" construct which allows
   implementations to support only those syslog features that lie within
   their capabilities.

   This module can be used to configure the syslog application
   conceptual layers [RFC5424] as implemented on the target system.

3.  Design of the Syslog Model

   The syslog model was designed by comparing various syslog features
   implemented by various vendors' in different implementations.

   This draft addresses the common leafs between implementations and
   creates a common model, which can be augmented with proprietary
   features, if necessary.  This model is designed to be very simple for
   maximum flexibility.

   Optional features are used to specify functionality that is present
   in specific vendor configurations.

   Syslog consists of originators, and collectors.  The following
   diagram shows syslog messages flowing from an originator, to
   collectors where filtering can take place.

   Many vendors extend the list of facilities available for logging in
   their implementation.  An example is included in Extending Facilities
   (Appendix A.1).

   Figure 1. Syslog Processing Flow

   The leaves in the syslog model "actions" container correspond to each
   message collector:

      console
      log file(s)
      remote relay(s)/collector(s)

   Within each action, a selector is used to filter syslog messages.  A
   selector consists of a list of one or more facility-severity matches,
   and, if supported via the select-match feature, an optional regular
   expression pattern match that is performed on the SYSLOG-MSG
   [RFC5424] field.

   A syslog message is processed if:

       There is an element of facility-list (F, S) where
           the message facility matches F (if it is present)
              and the message severity matches S (if it is present)
       or the message text matches the regex pattern (if it is present)

   The facility is one of a specific syslog-facility, or all facilities.

Internet-Draft             Syslog Management                  March 2017


   The severity is one of type syslog-severity, all severities, or none.
   None is a special case that can be used to disable a filter.  When
   filtering severity, the default comparison is that messages of the
   specified severity and higher are selected to be logged.  This is
   shown in the model as "default equals-or-higher".  This behavior can
   be altered if the select-adv-compare feature is enabled to specify a
   compare operation and an action.  Compare operations are: "equals" to
   select messages with this single severity, or "equals-or-higher" to
   select messages of the specified severity and higher.  Actions are
   used to log the message or block the message from being logged.

3.1.  Syslog Module

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is
   defined in [RFC6087].

      Requirement:
      Enable console logging of syslogs of severity critical
   
      Here is the example syslog configuration xml:
      <config xmlns:xc="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
        <syslog xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-syslog"
                xmlns:syslog="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-syslog">
          <actions>
            <console>
              <selector>
                <facility-list>
                  <facility>all</facility>
                  <severity>critical</severity>
                </facility-list>
              </selector>
            </console>
          </actions>
        </syslog>
      </config>
   
      Enable remote logging of syslogs to udp destination 2001:db8:a0b:12f0::1
      for facility auth, severity error
   
      <config xmlns:xc="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
        <syslog xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-syslog"
                xmlns:syslog="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-syslog">
          <actions>
            <remote>
              <destination>
                <name>remote1</name>
                <udp>
                  <address>2001:db8:a0b:12f0::1</address>

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers one URI in the IETF XML registry [RFC3688].

   Following the format in RFC 3688, the following registration is
   requested to be made:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-syslog

   Registrant Contact: The IESG.

   XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers a YANG module in the YANG Module Names
   registry [RFC6020].

   name: ietf-syslog namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-syslog

   prefix: ietf-syslog

   reference: RFC XXXX

8.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed via
   the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the
   secure transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is SSH [RFC6242].  The NETCONF access control model
   [RFC6536] provides the means to restrict access for particular
   NETCONF users to a pre-configured subset of all available NETCONF
   protocol operations and content.

Internet-Draft             Syslog Management                  March 2017


   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG module which are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., <edit-config>)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.

8.1.  Resource Constraints

   Network administrators must take the time to estimate the appropriate
   memory limits caused by the configuration of actions/buffer using
   buffer-limit-bytes and/or buffer-limit-messages where necessary to
   limit the amount of memory used.

   Network administrators must take the time to estimate the appropriate
   storage capacity caused by the configuration of actions/file using
   file-archive attributes to limit storage used.

   It is the responsibility of the network administrator to ensure that
   the configured message flow does not overwhelm system resources.

8.2.  Inappropriate Configuration

   It is the responsibility of the network administrator to ensure that
   the messages are actually going to the intended recipients.

Appendix A.  Implementor Guidelines

Appendix A.1.  Extending Facilities

   Many vendors extend the list of facilities available for logging in
   their implementation.  Additional facilities may not work with the
   syslog protocol as defined in [RFC5424] and hence such facilities
   apply for local syslog-like logging functionality.

   The following is an example that shows how additional facilities
   could be added to the list of available facilities (in this example
   two facilities are added):
