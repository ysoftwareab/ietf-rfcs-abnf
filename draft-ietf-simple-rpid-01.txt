Abstract

   The Rich Presence Information Data Format (RPID) adds elements to the
   Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) that provide additional
   information about the presentity and its contacts.  This information
   can be translated into call routing behavior or be delivered to
   watchers, for example.  The information is designed so that much of
   it can be derived automatically, e.g., from calendar files or user
   activity.

1. Scope

   This extension does not replace media negotiation mechanisms defined
   for SIP (e.g., SDP [8]), therefore media negotiation (e.g., choice of
   voice and video codecs) MUST be performed according to RFC 3264 [10].
   This extension is only aimed to give the watchers hints about the
   presentity's preferences, willingness and capabilities to communicate
   before watchers initiate SIP-based communication with the presentity.

2. Terminology and Conventions

   This memo makes use of the vocabulary defined in the IMPP Model
   document [4].  Terms such as CLOSED, INSTANT MESSAGE, OPEN, PRESENCE
   SERVICE, PRESENTITY, WATCHER, and WATCHER USER AGENT in the memo are
   used in the same meaning as defined therein.  The key words MUST,
   MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and
   OPTIONAL in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   XX, RFC 2119 [1].

3. The Meaning of "open" and "closed"

   PIDF describes the basic status values of "open" or "closed" only as
   "have meanings of general availability for other communications
   means". We define "closed" in our context as meaning that
   communication to the contact address will in all likelihood not
   succeed, is undesired or will not reach the intended party.  (For
   example, a presentity may include a hotel phone number as a contact.
   After check-out, the phone number will still ring, but reach the
   chambermaid or the next guest.  Thus, it would be declared "closed".)
   For "pres" contacts, "closed" means that no presence status
   information is available.

4. RPID Elements

4.1 Introduction

   Below, we describe the RPID elements in detail.  <activity>, <idle>
   <placetype>, <privacy>, <relationship>, extend the PIDF <status>
   element, while <class> and <contacttype> extend the PIDF <tuple>
   element.

   In general, it is highly unlikely that a presentity will publish or
   announce all of these elements at the same time.  Rather, these
   elements were chosen to give the presentity maximum flexibility in
   deriving this information from existing sources, such as calendaring
   tools, device activity sensors or location trackers, as well as to
   manually configure this information.

   The namespace URIs for these elements defined by this specification
   are URNs [2], using the namespace identifier 'ietf' defined by [3]
   and extended by [5]:

      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:rpid-status
      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:rpid-tuple


4.2 Activity Element

   The <activity> indication describes what the presentity is currently
   doing.  This can be quite helpful to the watcher in judging how
   appropriate a communication attempt is and which means of
   communications is most likely to succeed and not annoy the
   presentity. The activity indications correspond roughly to the
   category field in calendar entries, such as Section 4.8.1.2 of RFC
   2445.

   An activity indication consists of one or more values drawn from the
   list below, any other token string or IANA-registered values (Section
   Section 7).  Communities of interest such as a profession or an
   organization may define additional activity labels for their internal
   use.

   Depending on the presentity intent, all but the "available"
   indication can be used with either status OPEN or CLOSED.

   Available: The presentity is available for communication.

   On-the-phone: The presentity is talking on the telephone. This
      activity is included since it can often be derived automatically.

Internet-Draft                    RPID                     February 2004


   Away: The presentity is physically away from the device location.
      This activity was included since it can often be derived
      automatically from security systems, energy management systems or
      entry badge systems.

   Appointment: The presentity has a calendar appointment.

   Holiday: This is a scheduled national or local holiday. This
      information can typically be derived automatically from calendars.

   Meal: The presentity is scheduled for a meal.  This activity category
      can often be generated automatically from a calendar.

   Meeting: This activity category can often be generated automatically
      from a calendar.

   Steering: The presentity is controlling a vehicle, ship or plane.

   In-transit: The presentity is riding in a vehicle, such as a car, but
      not steering. Alternatively, the presentity MAY offer more
      specific information.

   Travel: The presentity is on a business or personal trip, but not
      necessarily in-transit.  This category can often be generated
      automatically from a calendar.

   Vacation: This activity category can often be generated automatically
      from a calendar.

   Sleeping: This activity category can often be generated automatically
      from a calendar, local time information or biometric data.

   Busy: User is busy, without further details.  This activity category
      would typically be indicated manually.

   Permanent-absence: Presentity will not return for the foreseeable
      future, e.g., because it is no longer working for the company.

   The <activity> element MAY be qualified with the 'from' and 'until'
   attributes to describe the time when the element assumed this value
   and the time until which is element is expected to be valid.  The
   'from' time MUST be in the past, the 'until' time in the future
   relative to the publication of the presence information.

4.3 Class

   The 'class' attribute describes the class of the tuple.  Multiple
   tuples can have the same class name within a presence document.  The

Internet-Draft                    RPID                     February 2004


   naming of classes is left to the presentity.  The presentity can use
   this information to group similar tuples or to convey information
   that the presence agent can use for filtering.


4.4 Contact-Type Element

   The <contacttype> element describes the type of the tuple.  A tuple
   can represent a communication facility ("device"), a face-to-face
   communication tuple ("in-person"), a set of devices offering a common
   service ("service"), or a whole presentity ("presentity").
   Additional types can be registered with IANA.


4.5 Idle Element

   The <idle> records the absolute time and date the communication
   device was last used.  This provides an indication as to how likely a
   user is to answer the device.  A device that has not been used in a
   while may still be OPEN, but a watcher may choose to first contact a
   device that is both OPEN and not marked as idle.

   The <idle> element can be empty if the presentity wants to indicate
   that the device has not been used for a while, but does not want to
   reveal the precise duration:

     <idle/>

   The <idle> SHOULD be included in the presence document if the idle
   time exceeds a user-setable threshold, with a RECOMMENDED default
   value of 10 minutes.  Configuration MUST include the option to omit
   the timestamp.

4.6 Type of Place Element

   The <placetype> element describes the type of place the presentity is
   currently at. This offers the watcher an indication what kind of
   communication is likely to be appropriate. We define an initial set
   of values below:

   home: The presentity is in a private or residential setting, not
      necessarily the personal residence of the presentity, e.g.,
      including hotel or a friend's home.

   office: The presentity is in a business setting, such as an office.

Internet-Draft                    RPID                     February 2004


   public: The presentity is in a public area such as a shopping mall,
      street, park, public building, train station, airport or in public
      conveyance such as a bus, train, plane or ship. Alternatively, the
      more detailed indications below may be provided.

   street: Walking in a street.

   public-transport: Any form of public transport, including aircraft,
      bus, train or ship.

   aircraft: The presentity is in a plane, helicopter or balloon.

   ship: Water vessel, boat.

   bus: Public bus.

   train: The presentity is traveling in a train, cable car.

   airport: Airport, heliport or similar location.

   station: Bus or train station.

   mall: Shopping mall or shopping area.

   outdoors: General outdoors area, such as a park or city streets.

   This list can be augmented by free-text values or additional
   IANA-registered values (Section Section 7).

   The <placetype> element MAY be qualified with the 'from' and 'until'
   attributes to describe the time when the element assumed this value
   and the time until which is element is expected to be valid.  The
   'from' time MUST be in the past, the 'until' time in the future
   relative to the publication of the presence information.


4.7 Privacy Element

   The 'privacy' element indicates whether third parties may be able to
   hear or view parts of the communication.

   public: Others may be able to see or hear the communications.

   private: Inappropriate individuals are not likely to see or hear the
      communications.

Internet-Draft                    RPID                     February 2004


   quiet: The presentity is in a place such as a library, restaurant,
      place-of-worship, or theater that discourages noise, conversation
      and other distractions.

   This indication is not limited to voice communications.  For example,
   a presentity might label her privacy as "quiet" when giving a talk,
   since it would be inappropriate if an instant message popped up on
   the laptop screen that is being projected for the audience.

   The 'activity' element MAY be qualified with the 'from' and 'until'
   attributes to describe the time when the element assumed this value
   and the time until which is element is expected to be valid.  The
   'from' time MUST be in the past, the 'until' time in the future
   relative to the publication of the presence information.

4.8 Relationship Element

   The <relationship> element designates the type of relationship an
   alternate contact has with the presentity.  This element is provided
   only if the tuple refers to somebody other than the presentity.
   Relationship values include "family", "associate" (e.g., for a
   colleague), "assistant", "supervisor".  Other free-text values and
   additional IANA-registered values (Section Section 7) can be used as
   well.

   The <contact> element for tuples labeled with a relationship can
   contain either a communication URI such as "im", "sip"/"sips",
   "h323", "tel" or "mailto", or a presence URI, such as "pres" or
   "sip".

4.9 Sphere Element

   The <sphere> element designates the current state and role that the
   presentity plays.  For example, it might describe whether the
   presentity is in a work mode or at home or participating in
   activities related to some other organization such as the IETF or a
   church.  This document does not define names for these spheres except
   for two common ones, "work" and "home".

   Spheres are likely to be used for two purposes:  they allow the
   presentity to easily turn on or off certain rules that depend on what
   groups of people should be made aware of the presentity's status.
   For example, if the presentity is a Boy Scout leader, he might set
   the sphere to 'scouting' and then have a rule set that allows other
   scout masters in his troup to see his presence status.  As soon as he
   switches his status to 'work' or 'home' or some other sphere, the
   fellow scouts would lose access.

7. IANA Considerations

   This document calls for IANA to:

   o  register two new XML namespace URNs per [5];

   o  establish registry for activity categories (Section Section 4.2,
      place types (Section Section 4.6), and relationships (Section
      Section 4.8).

   Note that this document does not need a new content type.  It
   inherits the content type from [6], namely application/cpim-pidf+xml.

7.1 URN Sub-Namespace Registration for
    'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:rpid-status'

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:rpid-status

   Description: This is the XML namespace for XML elements defined by
      RFCXXXX to describe rich presence information extensions for the
      status element in the PIDF presence document format in the
      application/cpim-pidf+xml content type.

7.2 URN Sub-Namespace Registration for
    'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:rpid-tuple'

   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:rpid-tuple

   This is the XML namespace for XML elements defined by RFCXXXX to
   describe rich presence information extensions for the tuple element
   in the PIDF presence document format in the application/cpim-pidf+xml
   content type.

   IETF, SIMPLE working group, simple@ietf.org, Henning Schulzrinne,
   hgs@cs.columbia.edu.

      END



7.3 Place Type, Tuple Type, Activities, Relationships

   This document creates new IANA registries for activities, tuple
   types, place types and relationships.  All are XML tokens.
   Registered tokens must be documented at the time of registration, as
   most descriptions are expected to be brief.

   The SIMPLE working group, or, if no longer available, the SIP working
   group should be consulted prior to registration.

8. Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [6] apply, as well as [7]. Compared to
   PIDF, this presence document format reveals additional information
   that can be highly sensitive. Beyond traditional security measures to
   protect confidentiality and integrity, systems should offer a means
   to selectively reveal information to particular watchers and to
   inspect the information that is being published, particularly if it
   is generated automatically from other sources, such as calendars or
   sensors.
