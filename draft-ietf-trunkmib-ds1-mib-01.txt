Abstract

   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   the Internet community.  In particular, it describes objects used for
   managing DS1, E1, DS2 and E2 interfaces.  This document is a
   companion document with Definitions of Managed Objects for the DS3/E3
   and SONET/SDH Interface Types, rfc1407 [17] and rfc1595 [18].

   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both compliant
   to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the peer SNMPv1
   definitions.

   This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet community.

   This document entirely replaces RFC 1406.

1.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Network Management Framework presently consists of three major
     components.  They are:

   o    the SMI, described in RFC 1902 [1] - the mechanisms used for
        describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

   o    the MIB-II, STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] - the core set of managed
        objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

   o    the protocol, RFC 1157 [3] and/or RFC 1905 [4], - the protocol
        for accessing managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

2.  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to also refer to
   the object type.

2.1.  Changes from RFC1406

   The changes from RFC1406 are the following:

        (1)  The Fractional Table has been deprecated

        (2)  This document uses SMIv2

        (3)  Values are given for ifTable and ifXTable

        (4)  Example usage of ifStackTable is included

        (8)  The definition of valid intervals has been clarified
             for the case where the agent proxied for other
             devices.  In particular, the treatment of missing
             intervals has been clarified.

        (9)  An inward loopback has been added.

        (10) Additional lineStatus bits have been added for Near End
             in Unavailable Signal State, Carrier Equipment Out of
             Service, DS@ Payload AIS, and DS@ Performance Threshold

3.  Overview

   These objects are used when the particular media being used to
   realize an interface is a DS1/E1/DS2/E2 interface.  At present, this
   applies to these values of the ifType variable in the Internet-
   standard MIB:

        ds1 (18)

   The definitions contained herein are based on the AT&T T-1 Superframe
   (a.k.a., D4) and Extended Superframe (ESF) formats [6, 7], the latter
   of which conforms to ANSI specifications [8], and the CCITT
   Recommendations [9, 10], referred to as E1 for the rest of this memo.

   The various DS1 and E1 line disciplines are similar enough that
   separate MIBs are unwarranted, although there are some differences.
   For example, Loss of Frame is defined more rigorously in the ESF
   specification than in the D4 specification, but it is defined in
   both.

   Where it is necessary to distinguish between the flavors of E1 with
   and without CRC, E1-CRC to denotes the "with CRC" form (G.704 Table
   4b) and E1-noCRC denotes the "without CRC" form (G.704 Table 4a).

3.1.  Use of ifTable for DS1 Layer

                              cases such as DS1/E1 over AAL1/ATM where
                              false(2) is appropriate


3.2.  Using ifStackTable

   The objects dsx1IfIndex has been deprecated.  This object previously
   allowed a very special proxy situation to exist for Routers and CSUs.
   This section now describes how to use ifStackTable to represent this
   relationship.

   The paragraphs discussing dsx1IfIndex and dsx1LineIndex have been
   preserved in Appendix A for informational purposes.

   External&Internal interface scenario: the SNMP Agents resides on an
   host external from the device supporting DS1 interfaces (e.g., a
   router). The Agent represents both the host and the DS1 device.

   Example:

   A shelf full of CSUs connected to a Router. An SNMP Agent residing on
   the router proxies for itself and the CSU. The router has also an
   Ethernet interface:

3.3.  Objectives of this MIB Module

   There are numerous things that could be included in a MIB for DS1
   signals:  the management of multiplexors, CSUs, DSUs, and the like.
   The intent of this document is to facilitate the common management of
   all devices with DS1 interfaces.  As such, a design decision was made
   up front to very closely align the MIB with the set of objects that

   can generally be read from DS1 devices that are currently deployed.

3.4.  DS1 Terminology

   The terminology used in this document to describe error conditions on
   a DS1 interface as monitored by a DS1 device are based on the
   definitions from the ANSI T1.231 standard [11].  If the definition in
   this document does not match the definition in the ANSI T1.231
   document, the implementer should follow the definition described in
   this document.

3.4.1.  Error Events


     Bipolar Violation (BPV) Error Event
          A BPV error event for an AMI-coded signal is the
          occurrence of a pulse of the same polarity as the
          previous pulse.  A BPV error event for a B8ZS- or HDB3-
          coded signal is the occurrence of a pulse of the same
          polarity as the previous pulse without being a part of
          the zero substitution code. (See T1.231)

     Excessive Zeroes (EXZ) Error Event
          An Excessive Zeroes error event for an AMI-coded signal
          is the occurrence of more than fifteen contiguous zeroes.
          For a B8ZS coded signal, the defect occurs when more than
          seven contiguous zeroes are detected. (See T1.231)

     Line Coding Violation (LCV) Error Event
          A Line Coding Violation (LCV) is the occurrence of either
          a Bipolar Violation (BPV) or Excessive Zeroes (EXZ) Error
          Event. (

     Path Coding Violation (PCV) Error Event
          A Path Coding Violation error event is a frame
          synchronization bit error in the D4 and E1-noCRC formats,
          or a CRC error in the ESF and E1-CRC formats. (See T1.231)

     Controlled Slip (CS) Error Event
          A Controlled Slip is the replication or deletion of the
          payload bits of a DS1 frame.  A Controlled Slip  may be
          performed when there is a difference between the timing
          of a synchronous receiving terminal and the received
          signal.  A Controlled Slip does not cause an Out of Frame
          defect. (See T1.231)

3.4.2.  Performance Defects

     Out Of Frame (OOF) Defect
          An OOF defect is the occurrence of a particular density
          of Framing Error events. (See T1.231)

          For DS1 links, an Out of Frame defect is declared when the
          receiver detects two or more framing errors within a 3
          msec period for ESF signals and 0.75 msec for D4 signals,
          or two or more errors out of five or fewer consecutive
          framing-bits.

          For E1 links, an Out Of Frame defect is declared when
          three consecutive frame alignment signals have been
          received with an error (see G.706 Section 4.1 [15]).

          For DS2 links, an Out of Frame defect is declared when
          7 or more consecutive errored framing patterns (4
          multiframe) are received.  The LOF is cleared when 3
          or more consecutive correct framing patterns are
          received.

          Once an Out Of Frame Defect is declared, the framer
          starts searching for a correct framing pattern.  The Out
          of Frame defect ends when the signal is in frame.

          In-frame occurs when there are fewer than two frame bit
          errors within 3 msec period for ESF signals and 0.75 msec
          for D4 signals.

          For E1 links, in-frame occurs when a) in frame N the
          frame alignment signal is correct and b) in frame N+1 the
          frame alignment signal is absent (i.e., bit 2 in TS0 is a
          one) and c) in frame N+2 the frame alignment signal is
          present and correct.

     Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) Defect
          For D4 and ESF links, the 'all ones' condition is
          detected at a DS1 line interface upon observing an
          unframed signal with a one's density of at least 99.9%
          present for a time equal to or greater than T, where 3 ms
          <= T <= 75 ms.  The AIS is terminated upon observing a
          signal not meeting the one's density or the unframed
          signal criteria for a period equal to or greater than
          than T.

INTERNET-DRAFT             DS1/E1/DS2/E2 MIB               February 1996


          For E1 links, the 'all-ones' condition is detected at the
          line interface as a string of 512 bits containing fewer
          than three zero bits (see O.162 [12] Section 3.3.2).

          For DS2 links, the DS2 AIS shall be sent from the NT1
          to the user to indicate a loss of the 6,312 kbps
          frame capability on the network side.  The DS2 AIS is
          defined as a bit array of 6,312 kbps in which all
          binary bits are set to '1'.

          The DS2 AIS detection and removal shall be implemented
          according to ITU-T Draft Recommendation G.775[20]:
          - a DS2 AIS defect is detected when the incoming signal
          has two (2) or less ZEROs in a sequence of 3156 bits
          (0.5 ms).
          - a DS2 AIS defect is cleared when the incoming signal
          has three (3) or more ZEROs ina sequence of 3156 bits
          (0.5 ms).


3.4.3.  Performance Parameters

   All performance parameters are accumulated in fifteen minute
   intervals and up to 96 intervals (24 hours worth) are kept by an
   agent.  Fewer than 96 intervals of data will be available if the
   agent has been restarted within the last 24 hours.  In addition,
   there is a rolling 24-hour total of each performance parameter.

   There is no requirement for an agent to ensure fixed relationship
   between the start of a fifteen minute interval and any wall clock;
   however some agents may align the fifteen minute intervals with
   quarter hours.

   Performance parameters are of type Gauge32 because it is possible for
   these objects to decrease.  Objects may decrease when Unavailable
   Seconds occurs across a fifteen minutes interval boundary. See
   Unavailable Seconds discussion later in this section.
        Line Errored Seconds (LES)
             A Line Errored Second, according to T1.231, is a second
             in which one or more Line Code Violation error events
             were detected.

             While many implementations are currently unable to detect
             the zero strings, it is expected that interface
             manufacturers will add this capability in deference to

             ANSI; therefore, it will become available in time.

             In the T1.231 specification, near end Line Code
             Violations and far end Line Errored Seconds are counted.
             For consistency, we count Line Errored Seconds at both
             ends.

        Controlled Slip Seconds (CSS)
             A Controlled Slip Second, according to T1.231, is a
             one-second interval containing one or more controlled
             slips.

        Errored Seconds (ES)
             According to T1.231, For ESF and E1-CRC links an Errored
             Second is a second with one or more Path Code Violation
             OR one or more Out of Frame defects OR one or more
             Controlled Slip events OR a detected AIS defect.

             For D4 and E1-noCRC links, the presence of Bipolar
             Violations also triggers an Errored Second.

             This is not incremented during an Unavailable Second.

        Bursty Errored Seconds (BES)
             A Bursty Errored Second (also known as Errored Second
             type B in T1.231) is a second with fewer than 320 and
             more than 1 Path Coding Violation error events, no
             Severely Errored Frame defects and no detected
             incoming AIS defects.  Controlled slips are not
             included in this parameter.

             This is not incremented during an Unavailable Second.

        Severely Errored Seconds (SES)
             According to T1.231, a Severely Errored Second for ESF
             signals is a second with 320 or more Path Code
             Violation Error Events OR one or more Out of Frame
             defects OR a detected AIS defect.

             For E1-CRC signals, a Severely Errored Second is a second
             with 832 or more Path Code Violation error events OR one
             or more Out of Frame defects.

             For E1-noCRC signals, a Severely Errored Second is a 2048
             LCVs or more.

             For D4 signals, a Severely Errored Second is a count of
             one-second intervals with Framing Error events, or an OOF
             defect, or 1544 LCVs or more.

             Controlled slips are not included in this parameter.

             This is not incremented during an Unavailable Second.

        Severely Errored Framing Second (SEFS)
             An Severely Errored Framing Second is a second with one
             or more Out of Frame defects OR a detected AIS defect,
             according to T1.231

        Degraded Minutes
             A Degraded Minute is one in which the estimated error
             rate exceeds 1E-6 but does not exceed 1E-3 (see G.821
             [13]).

             Degraded Minutes are determined by collecting all of the
             Available Seconds, removing any Severely Errored Seconds
             grouping the result in 60-second long groups and counting
             a 60-second long group (a.k.a., minute) as degraded if the
             cumulative errors during the seconds present in the group
             exceed 1E-6.  Available seconds are merely those seconds
             which are not Unavailable as described below.

        Unavailable Seconds (UAS)
             Unavailable Seconds (UAS) are calculated by counting the
             number of seconds that the interface is unavailable.  The
             DS1 interface is said to be unavailable from the onset of
             10 contiguous SESs, or the onset of the condition leading
             to a failure (see Failure States).  If the condition
             leading to the failure was immediately preceded by one or
             more contiguous SESs, then the DS1 interface
             unavailability starts from the onset of these SESs.  Once
             unavailable, and if no failure is present, the DS1
             interface becomes available at the onset of 10 contiguous
             seconds with no SESs.  Once unavailable, and if a failure
             is present, the DS1 interface becomes available at the
             onset of 10 contiguous seconds with no SESs, if the
             failure clearing time is less than or equal to 10
             seconds.  If the failure clearing time is more than 10
             seconds, the DS1 interface becomes available at the onset
             of 10 contiguous seconds with no SESs, or the onset
             period leading to the successful clearing condition,

             whichever occurs later.  With respect to the DS1 error
             counts, all counters are incremented while the DS1
             interface is deemed available.  While the interface is
             deemed unavailable, the only count that is incremented is
             UASs. (See T1.231)

             A special case exists when the 10 or more second period
             crosses the 900 second statistics window boundary, as the
             foregoing description implies that the Severely Errored
             Second and Unavailable Second counters for the PREVIOUS
             interval must be adjusted when the Unavailable Signal
             State is entered.  Clearly, successive GETs of the
             affected dsx1IntervalSESs and dsx1IntervalUASs objects
             will return differing values if the first GET occurs
             during the first few seconds of the window.  This is
             viewed as an unavoidable side-effect of selecting the
             presently defined managed objects as a basis for this memo.

             To summarize, when the unavialable state is entered, SES
             is reduced by 10 and UAS is increased by 10.  The linkDown
             trap is sent at the start of the unavailable period, but
             the time on the trap will be tate of the first UAS,
             (i.e. 10 seconds earlier).

             The UAS effect can be acheived by using a delay technique.
             This is described in Appendix B.

3.4.4.  Failure States

The following failure states are received, or detected failures, that
are reported in the dsx1LineStatus object.  When a DS1 interface would,
if ever, produce the conditions leading to the failure state is
described in the appropriate specification.

     Far End Alarm Failure
          The Far End Alarm failure is also known as "Yellow Alarm"
          in the DS1 case, "Distant Alarm" in the E1 case, and
          "and Remote Alarm in the DS2 case." .  (See T1.231)

          For D4 links, the Far End Alarm failure is declared when
          bit 6 of all channels has been zero for at least 335 ms
          and is cleared when bit 6 of at least one channel is
          non-zero for a period T, where T is usually less than one
          second and always less than 5 seconds.  The Far End Alarm
          failure is not declared for D4 links when a Loss of

          Signal is detected.

          For ESF links, the Far End Alarm failure is declared if
          the Yellow Alarm signal pattern occurs in at least seven
          out of ten contiguous 16-bit pattern intervals and is
          cleared if the Yellow Alarm signal pattern does not occur
          in ten contiguous 16-bit signal pattern intervals.

          For E1 links, the Far End Alarm failure is declared when
          bit 3 of time-slot zero is received set to one on two
          consecutive occasions.  The Far End Alarm failure is
          cleared when bit 3 of time-slot zero is received set to
          zero.

          For DS2 links, if a loss of frame alignment (LOF or LOS)
          and/or DS2 AIS condition, is detected, the RAI signal
          shall be generated and transmitted to the remote side.

          The Remote Alarm Indication(RAI) signal is defined on
          m-bits as a repetition of the 16bit sequence consisting
          of eight binary '1s' and eight binary '0s' in
          m-bits(1111111100000000).  When the RAI signal is not
          sent (in normal operation),the HDLC flag pattern
          (01111110) in the m-bit is sent.

          The RAI failure is detected when 16 or more consecutive
          RAI-patterns (1111111100000000) are received.  The RAI
          failure is cleared when 4 or more consecutive
          incorrect-RAI-patterns are received.

     Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) Failure
          The Alarm Indication Signal failure is declared when an
          AIS defect is detected at the input and the  AIS defect
          still exists after the Loss Of Frame failure (which is
          caused by the unframed nature of the 'all-ones' signal)
          is declared. The AIS failure is cleared when the Loss Of
          Frame failure is cleared. (See T1.231)

          An AIS defect at a 6312 kbit/s (G.704) interface is
          detected when the incoming signal has two {2} or less
          ZEROs in a sequence of 3156 bits (0.5ms).

          The AIS signal defect is cleared when the incoming signal
          has three {3} or more ZEROs in a sequence of 3156 bits
          (0.5ms).

     Loss Of Frame Failure
          For DS1 links, the Loss Of Frame failure is declared when
          an OOF or LOS  defect has persisted for T seconds, where
          2 <= T <= 10.  The Loss Of Frame failure is cleared when
          there have been no OOF or LOS defects during a period T
          where 0 <= T <= 20.  Many systems will perform "hit
          integration" within the period T before declaring or
          clearing the failure e.g., see TR 62411 [14].

          For E1 links, the Loss Of Frame Failure is declared when
          an OOF defect is detected.

     Loss Of Signal Failure
          For DS1, the Loss Of Signal failure is declared upon
          observing 175 +/- 75 contiguous pulse positions with no
          pulses of either positive or negative polarity.  The LOS
          failure is cleared upon observing an average pulse
          density of at least 12.5% over a period of 175 +/- 75
          contiguous pulse positions starting with the receipt of a
          pulse.

          For E1 links, the Loss Of Signal failure is declared when
          greater than 10 consecutive zeroes are detected (see
          O.162 Section 3.4.4).

          A LOS defect at 6312kbit/s interfaces is detected when
          the incoming signal has "no transitions", i.e. when the
          signal level is less than or equal to a signal level of
          35dB below nominal, for N consecutive pulse intervals,
          where 10 <=N<=255.

          The LOS defect is cleared when the incoming signal has
          "transitions", i.e. when the signal level is greater
          than or equal to a signal level of 9dB below nominal,
          for N consecutive pulse intervals, where 10<=N<=255.

          A signal with "transitions" corresponds to a G.703
          compliant signal.

     Loopback Pseudo-Failure
          The Loopback Pseudo-Failure is declared when the near end
          equipment has placed a loopback (of any kind) on the DS1.
          This allows a management entity to determine from one
          object whether the DS1 can be considered to be in service
          or not (from the point of view of the near end

          equipment).

     TS16 Alarm Indication Signal Failure
          For E1 links, the TS16 Alarm Indication Signal failure is
          declared when time-slot 16 is received as all ones for
          all frames of two consecutive multiframes (see G.732
          Section 4.2.6).  This condition is never declared for DS1.

     Loss Of MultiFrame Failure
          The Loss Of MultiFrame failure is declared when two
          consecutive multiframe alignment signals (bits 4 through
          7 of TS16 of frame 0) have been received with an error.
          The Loss Of Multiframe failure is cleared when the first
          correct multiframe alignment signal is received.  The
          Loss Of Multiframe failure can only be declared for E1
          links operating with G.732 [16] framing (sometimes called
          "Channel Associated Signalling" mode).

     Far End Loss Of Multiframe Failure
          The Far End Loss Of Multiframe failure is declared when
          bit 2 of TS16 of frame 0 is received set to one on two
          consecutive occasions.  The Far End Loss Of Multiframe
          failure is cleared when bit 2 of TS16 of frame 0 is
          received set to zero.  The Far End Loss Of Multiframe
          failure can only be declared for E1 links operating in
          "Channel Associated Signalling" mode. (See G.732)

     DS2 Payload AIS Failure
          The DS2 Payload AIS is detected when the incoming signal
          of the 6,312 kbps frame payload [TS1-TS96] has 2 or less
          0's in a sequence of 3072 bits (0.5ms).  The DS2 Payload
          AIS is cleared when the incoming signal of the 6,312 kbps
          frame payload [TS1-TS96] has 3 or more 0's in a sequence
          of 3072 bits (0.5 ms).

     DS2 Performance Threshold
          DS2 Performance Threshold Failure monitors equipment
          performance and is based on the CRC (Cyclic Redundancy
          Check) Procedure defined in G.704.

          The DS2 Performance Threshold Failure is detected when
          the bit error ratio exceeds 10^-4 (Performance Threshold),
          and the DS2 Performance Threshold Failure shall be cleared
          when the bit error ratio decreased to less than 10^-6."

                      dsx1JBZS refers the Jammed Bit Zero Suppression,
                      in  which  the  AT&T specification of at least one
                      pulse every 8 bit periods is literally implemented
                      by forcing a pulse in bit 8 of each channel.
                      Thus, only seven bits per  channel, or 1.344 Mbps,
                      is available for data.

                      dsx1B8ZS refers to the use of a specified  pattern
                      of  normal  bits  and  bipolar violations which
                      are used to replace a sequence  of  eight zero
                      bits.

                      ANSI Clear Channels may use dsx1ZBTSI, or  Zero
                      Byte Time Slot Interchange.

                      E1 links, with or without CRC, use dsx1HDB3  or
                      dsx1AMI.

                      dsx1AMI refers to a mode wherein no  zero  code
                      suppression  is  present  and the line encoding
                      does not solve the problem directly.   In  this
                      application, the higher layer must provide data

-- The DS1 Far End Group

-- Implementation of this group is optional for all systems
-- that attach to a DS1 Interface.

-- The DS1 Far End Group consists of three tables:
--   DS1 Far End Current
--   DS1 Far End Interval
--   DS1 Far End Total

     -- The DS1 Far End Current Table

     -- The DS1 Far End Current table contains various statistics
     -- being collected for the current 15 minute interval.
     -- The statistics are collected from the far end messages on the
     -- Facilities Data Link.  The definitions are the same as
     -- described for the near-end information.

     -- the DS1 Fractional Group

     -- This group is deprecated.  It was mandatory for
     -- systems dividing a DS1 into channels containing different
     -- data streams that are of local interest.  Systems which
     -- are indifferent to data content, such as CSUs, need not
     -- implement it.

     -- The DS1 fractional table identifies which DS1 channels
     -- associated with a CSU are being used to support a
     -- logical interface, i.e., an entry in the interfaces table
     -- from the Internet-standard MIB.

     -- For example, consider an application managing a North
     -- American ISDN Primary Rate link whose division is a 384 kbit/s
     -- H1 "B" Channel for Video, a second H1 for data to a primary
     -- routing peer, and 12 64 kbit/s H0 "B" Channels. Consider that
     -- some subset of the H0 channels are used for voice and the
     -- remainder are available for dynamic data calls.

     -- we count a total of 14 interfaces multiplexed onto the DS1
     -- interface. Six DS1 channels (for the sake of the example,
     -- channels 1..6) are used for Video, six more (7..11 and 13)
     -- are used for data, and the remaining 12 are are in channels
     -- 12 and 14..24.

     -- Let us further imagine that ifIndex 2 is of type DS1 and
     -- refers to the DS1 interface, and that the interfaces layered
     -- onto it are numbered 3..16.

     -- We might describe the allocation of channels, in the
     -- dsx1FracTable, as follows:

     -- dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 1 = 3    dsx1FracIfIndex.2.13 = 4
     -- dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 2 = 3    dsx1FracIfIndex.2.14 = 6
     -- dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 3 = 3    dsx1FracIfIndex.2.15 = 7

     -- dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 5 = 3    dsx1FracIfIndex.2.17 = 9
     -- dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 6 = 3    dsx1FracIfIndex.2.18 = 10
     -- dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 7 = 4    dsx1FracIfIndex.2.19 = 11
     -- dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 8 = 4    dsx1FracIfIndex.2.20 = 12

5.  Appendix A - Use of dsx1IfIndex and dsx1LineIndex

   Different physical configurations for the support of SNMP with DS1
   equipment exist. To accommodate these scenarios, two different
   indices for DS1 interfaces are introduced in this MIB.  These indices
   are dsx1IfIndex and dsx1LineIndex.

   External interface scenario: the SNMP Agent represents all managed
   DS1 lines as external interfaces (for example, an Agent residing on
   the device supporting DS1 interfaces directly):

   For this scenario, all interfaces are assigned an integer value equal
   to ifIndex, and the following applies:

      ifIndex=dsx1IfIndex=dsx1LineIndex for all interfaces.

   The dsx1IfIndex column of the DS1 Configuration table relates each
   DS1 interface to its corresponding interface (ifIndex) in the
   Internet-standard MIB (MIB-II STD 17, RFC1213).

   External&Internal interface scenario: the SNMP Agents resides on an
   host external from the device supporting DS1 interfaces (e.g., a

   router). The Agent represents both the host and the DS1 device.  The
   index dsx1LineIndex is used to not only represent the DS1 interfaces
   external from the host/DS1-device combination, but also the DS1
   interfaces connecting the host and the DS1 device.  The index
   dsx1IfIndex is always equal to ifIndex.

   Example:

   A shelf full of CSUs connected to a Router. An SNMP Agent residing on
   the router proxies for itself and the CSU. The router has also an
   Ethernet interface:

           ifIndex (= dsx1IfIndex)                     dsx1LineIndex
                   1                   NA                  NA (Ethernet)

                   5      Line#D   Network Side           13

   description of dsx1LineIndex:  the dsx1LineIndex identifies a DS1
   Interface on a managed device.  If there is an ifEntry that is
   directly associated with this and only this DS1 interface, it should
   have the same value as ifIndex.  Otherwise, number the
   dsx1LineIndices with an unique identifier following the rules of
   choosing a number greater than ifNumber and numbering inside
   interfaces (e.g., equipment side) with even numbers and outside
   interfaces (e.g., network side) with odd numbers.

   If the CSU shelf is managed by itself by a local SNMP Agent, the
   situation would be:

           ifIndex (= dsx1IfIndex)                      dsx1LineIndex

6.  Appendix B - The delay approach to Unavialable Seconds.

   According to ANSI T1.231 unavailable time begins at the _onset_ of 10
   contiguous severely errored seconds -- that is, unavailable time
   starts with the _first_ of the 10 contiguous SESs.  Also, while an
   interface is deemed unavailable all counters for that interface are
   frozen except for the UAS count.  It follows that an implementation
   which strictly complies with this standard must _not_ increment any
   counters other than the UAS count -- even temporarily -- as a result
   of anything that happens during those 10 seconds.  Since changes in
   the signal state lag the data to which they apply by 10 seconds, an
   ANSI-compliant implementation must pass the the one-second statistics
   through a 10-second delay line prior to updating any counters.  That
   can be done by performing the following steps at the end of each one
   second interval.

   i)   Read near/far end CV counter and alarm status flags from the
        hardware.

   ii)  Accumulate the CV counts for the preceding second and
        compare them to the ES and SES threshold for the layer
        in question.  Update the signal state and shift the
        one-second CV counts and ES/SES flags into the 10-element

        delay line.  Note that far-end one-second statistics are
        to be flagged as "absent" during any second in which there
        is an incoming defect at the layer in question or at any
        lower layer.

   iii) Update the current interval statistics using the signal
        state from the _previous_ update cycle and the one-second
        CV counts and ES/SES flags shifted out of the 10-element
        delay line.

   This procedure is illustrated below for a SONET interface.  Similar
   rules would apply for DS1 and DS3 interfaces.  Note that the
   procedure guarantees that the statistical counters will be correctly
   updated at all times, although they will lag real time by 10 seconds.
   Each 15 minutes one would transfer the current interval counts into
   the previous interval counts and drop the oldest set of interval
   counts off the cliff.  Note that signal state calculations would
   _not_ start afresh at each interval boundary;  signal state
   information _would_ be carried across interval boundaries.  A scheme
   similar to this one has been used at least one DS1 product I know of
   -- the Tektronix/LP COM TC-2000 PCM test set.  This product was first
   put on the market in 1987 and featured G.821 performance statistics
   collected in the manner shown below.

   Adopting such a procedure would, however, raise another issue:  for
   the first ten seconds after a system comes up the interface is in an
   unknown state.  It would be necessary to allow for up to ten seconds
   of dead time during the current interval.  Hence the dsx1TimeElapsed,
   dsx1FarEndTimeElapsed, dsx3TimeElapsed, dsx3FarEndTimeElapsed, and
   sonetMediumTimeElapsed objects _would_ need to be replaced by objects
   that allow for the possibility that _no_ valid data has yet been
   collected for the current interval.  Here are some possible
   replacement objects:
