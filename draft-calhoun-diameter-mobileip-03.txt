1.0  Introduction

   The Mobile IP [4] protocol defines a method that allows a Mobile Node
   to change its point of attachment to the Internet without service
   disruption.  The protocol requires that all Mobility Agents share a
   pre-existing security association, which leads to scaling and
   configuration problems. Mobile IP also does not mention how Mobility

   Agents account for services rendered, which does not make it an
   attractive protocol for use by service providers.

   This document specifies extensions to DIAMETER that allow cross-
   domain authentication and authorization, assignment of Mobile Node
   Home Addresses, assignment of Home Agent, as well as Key Distribution
   to allow the Mobile IP network to scale in a large network of service
   providers.

   The dynamic assignment of Mobile Node and Home Agent addresses are
   useful for Service Providers wishing to provide Mobile IP services
   for mobile nodes.

   The DIAMETER Accounting extension [12] will be used by the Foreign
   and Home agents to transfer usage information to the DIAMETER
   servers.

   Small modifications to the Mobile IP protocol [4], which already
   exists in the TEP protocol [8], to allow a Mobile Node to identify
   itself using an NAI [6] in addition to an IP address. The use of the
   Network Access Identifier (NAI) [6] is consistent with the current
   roaming model which makes use of DIAMETER proxying [7].

   The Extension number for this draft is four (4). This value is used
   in the Extension-Id Attribute value Pair (AVP) as defined in [1].

1.2  Requirements language

   In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST, "MUST NOT", "optional",
   "recommended", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT", are to be interpreted as
   described in [11].


1.3  Changes in version 02

   The following are the changes done to version 03 of the draft:

      - Cleaned up the AVP Header flags

      - The Command Code sections now show an optional Proxy-State AVP
      as part of the message format.

INTERNET DRAFT                                              October 1999


      - The previous version required that the MIP-Registration-Reply be
      present in the AMA, but the AVP could not be present if the AAAH
      could not service the request. The AVP is now only mandatory if
      the AMA is successful.

      - Cleaned up the description of the various key and SPI AVPs.

      - Added text in section 4.2 that describes how the AAAH can cache
      the keys directed for the AAAF so they can be included in the
      message when the response is received by the HA. This was the
      point that cause interoperability at the bake-off due to the fact
      that it was quite unclear.

      - Section 4.2 now correctly states that the Home-Address AVP MUST
      be present and MAY have a value of 0.0.0.0.

      - Section 4.2 now also states that the Mobile-IP FA-HA and the
      MN-HA authentication extensions must be used.

      - Added a reference to ESP

      - Added IANA Considerations


1.4  Changes in version 03

   The version 3 of this document contains many changes as a result of
   the DIAMETER Document Reading Party, and other ommisions found after
   the party. Many editorial changes have been done in addition to the
   following items:

      - DIAMETER_ERROR_UNKNOWN_DOMAIN has been removed from section 2.2
      since this is already provided by the base protocol [1].

      - Section 3.4 contains new text on the purpose of the MN-FA-
      Response, and how it is computed.

      - The MN-FA, MN-HA and FA-HA SPI AVPs are no longer supported. The
      various key extensions contain the SPI embedded within the AVP.
      This reduces the number of AVPs, and is consistent with the key
      encoding mechanism described in [15].

      - Key lifetime AVP in section 4.2 was changed to Session-Timeout
      AVP.

      - The Mobile-Node-Terminate-Ind messages were added (section 2.5).

      - Oh, and one of the author's affiliation changed.

2.0  Command Codes

   This section will define the Commands [1] for DIAMETER
   implementations supporting the Mobile IP extension.

2.1  AA-Mobile-Node-Request (AMR)

   Description

      The AA-Mobile-Node-Request is sent by a Foreign Agent acting as a
      DIAMETER client to a server to request authentication and
      authorization of a Mobile Node.

      The AA-Mobile-Node-Request message MUST include the MIP-
      Registration-Request, User-Name, MN-FA-Challenge-Length, MN-FA-
      Response AVP as well as the Session-ID AVPs.

      The Mobile-Node-Address AVP contains the the Home Address found in
      the Mobile Node's Registration Request. The Home-Agent-Address AVP
      contains the Home Address found in the Registration Request. If
      the Home Address is zero, it indicates that the Mobile Node is
      requesting that an address be allocated to it.

      The User-Name AVP contains the NAI found in the Mobile IP
      Registration Request's Mobile-Node-NAI Extension.

      If the Previous-FA-NAI AVP is found in the request, the DIAMETER
      Client is requesting that the Server return the Session Key that
      was assigned to the previous Foreign Agent for use with the Mobile
      Node. The Session Key is identified through the use of the
      Mobile-Node-Address AVP.

   The length of the DIAMETER Command AVP must be 12 when the Command
   Code is set to 306 (AA-Mobile-Node-Request).


2.2  AA-Mobile-Node-Answer (AMA)

   Description

      The AA-Mobile-Node-Answer is sent by the DIAMETER Server to the
      client in response to the AA-Mobile-Node-Request message. The
      message MUST include the Session-Id, Result-Code as well as the
      various key AVPs (see section 3.0) and MAY include the Home-
      Agent-Address and Mobile-Node-Address AVPs. A successful response
      MUST include the MIP-Registration-Reply AVP.

      The Home-Agent-Address AVP contains the Home Agent assigned to the
      Mobile Node. If the AVP contains a zero address, it is a request
      to allocate a Home Agent locally.

      The Mobile-Node-Address AVP contains the IP Address assigned to
      the Mobile Node. If this AVP contains a zero address, it is a
      request to allocate a Home Address for the Mobile Node.

      The following error codes are defined for this message for use in
      the Error-Code AVP [1]:

         DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_UNKNOWN         1
            This error code is used to indicate to the initiator that
            the username request is not valid.

         DIAMETER_ERROR_BAD_PASSWORD         2

            This error code indicates that the password provided is
            invalid.

         DIAMETER_ERROR_CANNOT_AUTHORIZE     3
            This error code is used to indicate that the user cannot be
            authorized due to the fact that the user has expended local
            resources. This could be a result that the server believes
            that the user has already spent the number of credits in
            his/her account, etc.

      Data
         The data field contains the mobile node's challenge response
         and is used to authenticate the mobile node. Although any
         authentication algorithm can be used, all implementations MUST
         support MD5's prefix+suffix mode, as described in [5]. The
         formula used to generate the hash is as follow:

            MD5(Key | Challenge | Key)

         Where the Key field is the secret shared between the DIAMETER
         Server and the Mobile Node. The key is concatinated with the
         Challenge value, which is found in the MIP-Registration-Request
         AVP. Note that only a portion of the data in the registration
         request is used for the calculation of the response. The length
         of the challenge can be found in the MN-FA-Challenge-Length
         AVP.

      Address
         The Address field contains the Home Agent address assigned to
         the Mobile Node. If the address is set to 0.0.0.0, the Mobile
         Node is requesting that a Home Agent be allocated either in the
         foreign network or in its home network. If the address is set
         to 255.255.255.255 the Mobile Node is requesting that the Home
         Agent be allocated only within its home network.


3.13  Previous-FA-NAI

   Description

      The Previous-FA-NAI AVP contains the Network Access Identifier of
      the Mobile Node's old Foreign Agent. The Mobile Node will include
      this information in the Registration Request when it moves it
      point of attachment to a new foreign agent under the same
      administrative domain as the old FA (identified by the domain part
      of the NAI).

      When this AVP is present in the AA-Mobile-Node-Request, it
      indicates that the local DIAMETER Server overseeing the Foreign
      Agent should attempt to return the session key that was previously
      allocated to the old Foreign Agent for the Mobile Node. The
      session key is identified through the use of the Mobile-Node-
      Address AVP, which MUST be present if this extension is present.

      This allows the Mobile Node to move from one Foreign Agent to
      another within the same administrative domain without having to
      send the request back to the Mobile Node's Home DIAMETER Server.

3.14  Foreign-Home-Agent-Available

   Description

      The Foreign-Home-Agent-Available AVP is added by the AAAF owned by
      the same adminitrative domain as the Foreign Agent if it is
      willing and able to allocate a Home Agent within the Foreign
      network for the Mobile Node.

      If this extension is present in the AMR and the Home-Agent-Address
      AVP is set to 0.0.0.0, the AAAH MAY allow the AAAF to assign a
      Home Agent for the Mobile Node. This is done by including the

                      Figure 1: Inter-Domain Mobility

   The AA-Mobile-Node-Request (AMR) is generated by the Foreign Agent
   and includes the AVPs defined in section 2.1. The Mobile-Node-Address
   AVP's value is copied from the Registration Request's Home Address
   field. The Home-Agent-Address AVP's value is copied from the
   Registration Request's Home Agent field. The value of the User-Name
   AVP [1] is taken from the Mobile-Node-NAI extension as described in
   [8]. The request is then forwarded to the Foreign Agent's local
   DIAMETER server, known as the AAA-Foreign, or AAAF.

   When the AAAF receives the message, it uses the User-Name AVP [1] to
   determine whether authentication and authorization can be handled
   locally. The User-Name format is consistent with the NAI described in
   [6] and the user's domain is used to determine the Mobile Node's home
   DIAMETER Server (or AAAH). In the example below, the request cannot
   be processed by the AAAF, therefore the request is proxied [9] to the

   AAAH. Note that this exchange is only required when the Mobile Node
   attempts to gain service with a new Foreign Agent, or if the keys
   previously distributed expire. The AAAF MAY include the Proxy-State
   AVP in the request, as described in [1], in order to assist it in
   keeping Session State Information.

              Figure 2: Mobile IP/DIAMETER Message Exchange

   The AAAH uses the security association shared between the itself and
   the Mobile Node in order to validate the MN-FA-Response. If the
   response is invalid, the AAAH returns the AA-Mobile-Node-Answer (AMA,
   see section 2.2) with a Result-Code set to the appropriate value.

   If the Mobile Node was successfully authenticated, the AAAH checks
   whether the Home-Agent-Address AVP specified a Home Agent. If one was
   specified, the AAAH must validate the address to ensure that it is a
   known Home Agent. If no Home Agent was specified the AAAH SHOULD
   allocate one on behalf of the Mobile Node. This can be done in a
   variety of ways, including using a load balancing algorithm in order
   to keep the load on all Home Agents equal. The actual algorithm used
   and the method of discovering the Home Agents is outside of this
   specification, but the method proposed in [4] can be used.

   If the AMR's Mobile-Node-Address AVP did not specify an address, the
   AAAH has the option of assigning an address for the Mobile Node, or
   it can leave this up to the Home Agent. This is purely a local policy
   decision.

   The AAAH then proceeds to generate three short-lived session keys;
   one which is shared between the Mobile Node and the Home Agent, one
   between the Mobile Node and the Foreign Agent, and one between the
   Foreign Agent and the Home Agent.

   The keys destined for the Mobile Node are encrypted either using the
   Mobile Node's secret or its public key [1, 9]. The keys destined for



Calhoun, Perkins           expires April 2000                  [Page 27]





INTERNET DRAFT                                              October 1999


   the Foreign Agent are encrypted either using the secret shared
   between the AAAH and the AAAF, or using public key cryptography [1,
   9]. The keys destined for the Home Agent can be either encrypted
   using the secret it shares with the AAAH. The Session-Timeout AVP is
   included and contains the number of seconds before the session keys
   expire. A value of zero indicates that the session keys have no
   expiration.

   Note that this extension requires a departure from the existing SPI
   usage described in [4]. The AAAH generates SPI values for the
   Mobility Agents as opposed to a receiver choosing its own SPI value.
   The SPI values are used as Key Identifiers, meaning that each short-
   lived session key has its own SPI value and since two nodes share a
   session key they share an SPI as well.

   Suppose a Mobile Node and a Foreign Agent share a key that was
   created by the AAAH. The AAAH also generated a corresponding SPI
   value of 37,496. All Mobile-Foreign Authentication extensions must be
   computed by either entity using the shared session key would then
   include the SPI value of 37,496.

   The AAAH then sends a Home-Agent-MIP-Request (HAR) to the assigned or
   requested Home Agent. The HAR contains the MIP-Registration-Request
   as well as the keys destined for the Home Agent (HA-to-MN-Key, HA-
   to-FA-Key AVPs) and the Mobile Node (MN-to-FA-Key, MN-to-HA-Key AVP).
   The Mobile-Node-Address AVP contains an address if the Mobile Node
   specified a home address or if the AAAH assigned an address, but no
   address would be specified if the Home Agent were to assign one.

   Note that the keys generated for the Foreign Agent, the SPIs and the
   Session Timeout  will have to be propagated to the AAAF in a future
   message. The AAAH can use one of two suggested methods:

      1. Maintain Session State information within the AAAH, based on
      the Session Identifier. When the Response from the Home Agent is
      received, the AAAH looks up the FA keys, SPI and Session Timeout
      and includes them in the DIAMETER message bound for the AAAF.

      2. Add the FA keys within the Proxy-State AVP [1]. The Home Agent
      MUST include the same Proxy-State AVP in the response. The AAAH
      can then pull the information from the Proxy-State AVP and include
      them in the message targeted for the AAAF.

   Note that the method used will not create any interoperability issues
   given that the decision is purely local and the Home Agent does not
   attempt to decode the Proxy-State AVP.

   The Home Agent processes the DIAMETER Home-Agent-MIP-Request as well

   as the embedded Mobile IP Registration Request. If both are
   successfull, the Home Agent creates the Mobile IP Registration Reply,
   and furthermore includes the keying material to be used by the Mobile
   Node (MN-to-FA-Key, MN-to-HA-Key) in the MIP-Registration-Reply AVP.
   If the address in the Mobile-Node-Address AVP in the request was set
   to zeros (0.0.0.0),  the Home Agent must assign an address for the
   Mobile Node. The Result-Code AVP is included and the Home-Agent-MIP-
   Answer is sent to the AAAH.

   The AAAH then issues a AA-Mobile-Node-Answer to the AAAF which
   includes the MIP-Registration-Reply, Result-Code and the Mobile-
   Node-Address AVP. As mentioned earlier, the AAAH must be able to find
   the previously created information destined for the AAAF, and add
   them in the response. The AVPs are must be added are the FA-to-MN-
   Key, FA-to-HA-Key and the Session-Timeout AVPs.

   Upon receipt of the successful AA-Mobile-Node-Answer the AAAF
   decrypts the FA-to-MN-Key and the FA-to-HA-Key AVPs. These keys are
   then re-encrypted using the DIAMETER secret [1] or via end-to-end
   encryption [9], unless IPSEC's ESP [10] is used between the Foreign
   Agent and the AAAF. The message is transmitted to the Foreign Agent.

   The Foreign Agent, upon receipt of the AA-Mobile-Node-Answer,
   decrypts the appropriate KEY AVPs, and processes the Mobile IP
   Registration Reply which is then forwarded to the Mobile Node.

   From this point on, all Registration Request and Replies need rely on
   the DIAMETER proxy chain, the Foreign Agent can contact the Home
   Agent directly using the keys which were previously distributed. This
   can continue until the session keys expire, as indicated in the
   Session-Timeout AVP [1].

   The following is an example of subsequent Mobile IP message exchange.

   FA Authentication extensions [4], using the keys generated by the
   AAAH.


4.3  Allocation of Home Agent in Foreign Network

   When the AAAF receives the AMR message, it can add the Foreign-Home-
   Agent-Available AVP to inform the AAAH that it is able and willing to
   assign a Home Agent for the Mobile Node. The AAAH will only allow
   this if the Home-Agent-Address in the AMR is set to zero (0). The
   AAAH does this by sending the AMA message to the AAAF with the Home-
   Agent-Address AVP set to zero (0). The AMA message still includes all
   of the keying information that was previously discussed, except that
   the keys for the Home Agent are encrypted using the security
   association the AAAH shares with the AAAF.

             Figure 4: Home Agent allocated in Foreign Domain

   Upon receipt of such a message, the AAAF issues the HAR message to
   the Home Agent. Upon receipt of the response from the Home Agent the
   AAAF issues the AMA message to the Foreign Agent in the same method
   described earlier.

   If the Mobile Node moves to another Foreign Network, which it detects
   from the Router Advertisement message, it can either request to keep
   the same Home Agent within the old foreign network, or it can request
   that a new one be assigned. If the Home-Agent-Address AVP is set to a
   value, it indicates that the same Home Agent should be used.

   In this case the new AAAF would issue the AMR message towards the
   Mobile Node's AAAH, which would create the keys as previously
   defined. In this case all of the keys destined for the Home Agent
   would be encrypted using the security association it shares with the
   old Foreign Network's AAAF, while the keys for the Foreign Agent
   would be encrypted using the security association shared with the new
   Foreign Network's AAAF.


4.4  DIAMETER Session Termination

   For DIAMETER Servers that maintain Mobile Node state information,
   each session has a specific lifetime, which is derived from the
   Session-Timeout AVP. Therefore a DIAMETER Server can release
   resources for a Mobile Node once the time has expired. However, it
   would be desirable for the DIAMETER Server to be notified when a
   session is terminated, which would allow it to release resources when
   they are no longer used.

   The Mobile-Node-Termination-Ind message is sent by a DIAMETER Client,
   be it a Foreign or Home Agent, to inform a DIAMETER Server that a
   session has been terminated. The MTI message MAY be sent by a
   DIAMETER Server to a client in order to request that the Mobile
   Node's session be terminated.
