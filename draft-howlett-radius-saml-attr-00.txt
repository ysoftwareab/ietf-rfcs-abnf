Internet-Draft  A RADIUS attribute for SAML messages          May 2010


Abstract

   This document defines the SAML-Construct attribute using the Remote
   Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS). This attribute is used
   for encapsulating Security Assertion Mark-up Language (SAML)
   constructs.

1. Introduction

   This document defines the SAML-Construct attribute for the Remote
   Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS). This attribute
   encapsulates Security Assertion Mark-up Language (SAML) constructs.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

3. SAML-Construct Attribute

   This attribute contains a SAML [Core] construct. This attribute MAY
   be used with any AAA protocol that makes use of RADIUS attributes,
   such as RADIUS [RFC2865] or DIAMETER [RFC3588].

   Where multiple SAML-Construct attributes are included in an AAA
   protocol message (for example, a RADIUS packet), the Construct field
   of the attributes are to be concatenated to form a SAML construct.

   A summary of the SAML-Construct format is shown below. The fields are
   transmitted from left to right.

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Type

     TBD

   Length

     >=4

   Construct Type (CT)

     The Construct Type field is a one octet enumerated field. It takes
     an integer value denoting the type of SAML construct in the
     Construct field.

     TBD   SAML Request protocol element

     TBD   SAML Response protocol element

     All other values are reserved for IANA allocation subject to the
     provisions of section 5.

   Construct

     The Construct field is one or more octets. It contains a SAML
     construct (for example, as defined in [SAMLCore]). If larger than a
     single attribute, the SAML construct data MUST be split on 253-
     octet boundaries over as many attributes as necessary. On
     reception, the SAML construct is reconstructed by concatenating the
     contents of all SAML-Construct attributes.

4. Security Considerations

   TODO

5. IANA Considerations

   The following numbers have been assigned in the RADIUS Attribute
   Types registry.

   A new RADIUS Attribute Type: SAML-Construct (TDB)

   The enumerated values of the newly registered RADIUS Attribute Type
   as defined in this document were assigned at the same time as the new
   Attribute Type.

   For the SAML-Construct Attribute:

     TBD  SAML Request protocol element

     TBD  SAML Response protocol element

   Assignments of additional enumerated values for the RADIUS attributes
   defined in this document are to be processed as described in
   [RFC3575], subject to the additional requirements of a published
   specification.
