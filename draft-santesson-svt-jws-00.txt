1.  Introduction

   The "Signature Validation Token" specification [SVT] defines the
   basic token to support signature validation in a way that can
   significantly extend the lifetime of a signature.

   This specification defines a profile for implementing SVT with a JWS
   signed payload according to [RFC7515], and defines the following
   aspects of SVT usage:

   *  How to include reference data related to JWS signatures in an SVT.

   *  How to add an SVT token to JWS signatures.

   A JWS may have one or more signatures depending on its serialization
   format, signing the same payload data.  A JWS either contains the
   data to be signed (enveloping) or may sign any externally associated
   payload data (detached).

   To provide a generic solution for JWS, an SVT is added to each
   present signature as a JWS Unprotected Header.  If a JWS includes
   multiple signatures, then each signature includes its own SVT.

2.  Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The definitions in [SVT] and [RFC7515] apply also to this document.

3.  SVT in JWS

   An SVT token MAY be added to any signature of a JWS to support
   validation of that signature.  If more than one signature is present
   then each present SVT MUST provide information exclusively related to
   one associated signature and MUST NOT include information about any
   other signature in the JWS.

   Each SVT is stored in its associated signature's "svt" header as
   defined in Section 3.1.

3.1.  "svt" Header Parameter

   The "svt" (Signature Validation Token) Header Parameter is used to
   contain an array of SVT tokens to support validation of the
   associated signature.  Each SVT token in the array has the format of
   a JWT as defined in [RFC7519] and is stored using its natural string
   representation without further wrapping or encoding.

   The "svt" Header Parameter, when used, MUST be included as a JWS
   Unprotected Header.

   Note: JWS Unprotected Header is not supported with JWS Compact
   Serialization.  A consequence of adding an SVT token to a JWS is
   therefore that JWS JSON Serialization MUST be used, either in the
   form of general JWS JSON Serialization (for one or more signatures)
   or in the form of flattened JWS JSON Serialization (optionally used
   when only one signature is present in the JWS).

3.2.  Multiple SVT in a signature

   If a new SVT is stored in a signature which already contains a
   previously issued SVT, implementations can choose to either replace
   the existing SVT or to store the new SVT in addition to the existing
   SVT.

   If a JWS signature already contains an array of SVTs and a new SVT is
   to be added, then the new SVT MUST be added to the array of SVT
   tokens in the existing "svt" Header Parameter.

4.  SVT Claims

4.1.  Signature Reference Data

   The SVT Signature object MUST contain a "sig_ref" claim (SigReference
   object) with the following elements:

   *  "sig_hash" - The hash over the associated signature value (the
      bytes of the base64url-decoded signature parameter).

   *  "sb_hash" - The hash over all bytes signed by the associated
      signature (the JWS Signing Input according to [RFC7515]).

4.2.  Signed Data Reference Data

   The SVT Signature object MUST contain one instance of the "sig_data"
   claim (SignedData object) with the following elements:

   *  "ref" - This parameter MUST hold one of the following thee
      possible values.

      1.  The explicit string value "payload" if the signed JWS Payload
          is embedded in a "payload" member of the JWS.

      2.  The explicit string value "detached" if the JWS signs detached
          payload data without explicit reference.

      3.  A URI that can be used to identify or fetch the detached
          signed data.  The means to determine the URI for the detached
          signed data is outside the scope of this specification.

   *  "hash" - The hash over the JWS Payload data bytes (not its
      base64url-encoded string representation).

4.3.  Signer Certificate References

   The SVT Signature object MUST contain a "signer_cert_ref" claim
   (CertReference object).  The "type" parameter of the
   "signer_cert_ref" claim MUST be either "chain" or "chain_hash".

   *  The "chain" type MUST be used when signature validation was
      performed using one or more certificates where some or all of the
      certificates in the chain are not present in the target signature.

   *  The "chain_hash" type MUST be used when signature validation was
      performed using one or more certificates where all of the
      certificates are present in the target signature JOSE header using
      the "x5c" Header Parameter.

5.  SVT JOSE Header

5.1.  SVT Signing Key Reference

   The SVT JOSE header must contain one of the following header
   parameters in accordance with [RFC7515], for storing a reference to
   the public key used to verify the signature on the SVT:

   *  "x5c" - Holds an X.509 certificate [RFC5280] or a chain of
      certificates.  The certificate holding the public key that
      verifies the signature on the SVT MUST be the first certificate in
      the chain.

   *  "kid" - A key identifier holding the Base64 encoded hash value of
      the certificate that can verify the signature on the SVT.  The
      hash algorithm MUST be the same hash algorithm used when signing
      the SVT as specified by the "alg" header parameter.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Header Parameter Names Registration

   This section registers the "svt" Header Parameter in the IANA "JSON
   Web Signature and Encryption Header Parameters" registry established
   by [RFC7515].

6.1.1.  Registry Contents

   *  Header Parameter Name: "svt"

   *  Header Parameter Description: Signature Validation Token

   *  Header Parameter Usage Location(s): JWS

   *  Change Controller: IESG

   *  Specification Document(s): Section 3.1 of {this document}

   NOTE to RFC editor: Please replace {this document} with its assigned
   RFC number.
