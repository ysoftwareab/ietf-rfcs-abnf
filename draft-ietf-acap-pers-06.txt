Abstract
    
    It has become common for Internet mail users to receive and compose
    mail in the capacity of different roles or identities (for example,
    personal and work), to receive and compose mail at different
    machines, and to use multiple programs which require mail
    composition configuration information.  These different roles or
    identities have become known as email personalities.
    
    The Application Configuration Access Protocol [ACAP] provides an
    ideal mechanism for storage of email personality data.

4.  ACAP Standard Options
    
    This specification defines the MUA Default Personality standard
    option.  This is a scaler option in the ACAP Standard Option
    ("/option") dataset.  The entry name is "mua.default.personality".
    The "option.value" attribute contains the value, which is a URL.
    Generally, this will be an ACAP URL pointing to an entry in an Email
    Personality dataset.
    
    The standard option dataset class is specified in [ACAP-OPTIONS].
    ACAP URLs are defined in [ACAP].
    
    
5.  ACAP Email Personality Dataset Class
    
    The ACAP Email Personality dataset class defines a set of attributes
    which specify an email personality; that is, configuration
    information used for composing and sending email.
    
    Configuration information related to accessing and retrieving
    received email is stored in the ACAP Email Account Dataset Class
    [ACAP-ACCOUNT].
    
    
5.1.  ACAP Email Personality Dataset Class Prefix
    
    Datasets whose names begin with "/personality" are assumed to
    contain email personality entries as defined in this specification.
    
    
5.2.  ACAP Email Personality Dataset Hierarchy
    
    Each user may have a set of named email personalities.  The default
    is pointed at by the "mua.default.personality" standard option.
    (See section 4 for more information.)
    
    Inheritance is likely to be useful both for inheriting site or group
    defaults (for example, [SMTP] servers, and initial client
    configuration in general) as well as for inheriting user-specific
    configuration when using different machines.

6.  ACAP Email Personality Dataset Attributes
    
    An email personality entry MUST have an "entry" attribute.  All
    other attributes are OPTIONAL.
    
    Attributes are specified using Augmented Backus-Naur Form [ABNF].
    All attributes are single-valued and textual unless otherwise
    stated.
    
    The ABNF defines the content of the attribute values prior to their
    encoding as an ACAP string.  Clients MUST conform to the syntax when
    generating these attributes, but MUST NOT assume that the attribute
    values will conform to this syntax on access.  Servers MUST NOT
    enforce the syntax.
    
    
6.1.  Basic Attributes
    
    These attributes are defined in ACAP [ACAP] and have meaning in all
    dataset classes.  This section describes how they are used in an
    email personality dataset.
    
    entry
        The "entry" attribute is used to hold a unique name for the
        personality.  This name is used for inheritance, so when
        customizing a personality which has an entry in an inherited
        dataset, the entry name needs to remain the same.  The name
        should also be descriptive.
        
    subdataset
        The "subdataset" attribute indicates that there is a subdataset
        of this entry.  The value of this attribute specifies the actual
        location of the subdataset, per [ACAP] section 3.1.1.
    
    
6.2.  Specific Attributes
    
    These attributes are specific to the Email Personality dataset
    class.
    
    personality.Auto.Encrypt
        This flag indicates if the client should automatically encrypt
        messages composed with this personality.
        
        pers-auto-enc       = "0" / "1"

Internet Draft    ACAP Email Personality Dataset Class    February 2003


    personality.Auto.Sign
        This flag indicates if the client should automatically apply a
        digital signature to messages composed with this personality.
        
        pers-auto-sign      = "0" / "1"
        
    personality.Cert-DN
        This contains the certificate name to be used when encrypting
        and/or signing messages using certificate-based mechanisms.
        
        pers-cert-dn        = 1*UTF8-CHAR
        
    personality.Charset
        This specifies the default coded character set to be used when
        composing messages.  The name must be in the IANA charset
        registry (located at
        <ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/character-sets>).
        
        pers-charset        = 1*CHAR
        
    personality.File-Into.IMAP
        This specifies an IMAP folder into which new messages should be
        copied by default.  Generally, this is specified as an IMAP URL,
        as defined in [URL-IMAP].
        
        pers-file-imap      = url ;defined in [URL-BASIC]
        
    personality.File-Into.Local
        This specifies the name of a local folder into which new
        messages should be placed by default.
        
        pers-file-local     = 1*UTF8-CHAR
        
    personality.Header.BCC
        This specifies the default BCC header field contents.
        
        pers-hdr-bcc        = *address
                              ;address specified in [RFC-822]
        
    personality.Header.CC
        This specifies the default CC header field contents.
        
        pers-hdr-cc         = 1*address
                              ;address specified in [RFC-822]

    personality.Header.Extra
        This multivalued attribute contains additional header fields.
        Each value contains the complete canonical form of a header name
        and contents.  Values must conform to [RFC-822] and [MIME].
        
        pers-hdr-extra      = 1*CHAR
                              ;must conform to [RFC-822] and [MIME]
        
    personality.Header.Reply-To
        This specifies the default Reply-To header field contents.
        Values must conform to [RFC-822] and [MIME].
        
        pers-hdr-reply      = 1*CHAR
                              ;must conform to [RFC-822] and [MIME]
        
    personality.Language
        This contains the default language to be specified in language
        tags.  The name must be in the IANA language registry (located
        at <ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/languages>).
        
        pers-lang           = 1*CHAR
        
    personality.MIME.Composition-Type
        This specifies the default MIME type to use when composing
        messages which contain any text elements or parts.  The value is
        a MIME type and subtype, with optional parameters.  The value
        should be canonicalized by removing unnecessary quoting.  The
        type, subtype, and any parameters must conform to [MIME],
        including IANA registration requirements.  Free insertion of
        linear-white-space is not permitted.
        
        pers-mtype          = type "/" subtype *(";" SP parameter)
                              ;defined in RFC 2045 [MIME]
        
    personality.PGP.Key-ID.bin
        This contains the Key ID when PGP is used to encrypt and/or sign
        messages.
        
        pers-pgp-key        = *OCTET
        
    personality.Real-Name
        This contains the display name associated with the personality.
        The phrase component of the From header field should be
        constructed from this value.
        
        pers-name           = 1*UTF8-CHAR

    personality.Return-Address
        This contains the [RFC-822] addr-spec associated with the
        personality.  The addr-spec of the From header field should by
        default contain this value.  It is separated from the phrase
        From field component (stored in "personality.Real-Name") to make
        comparisons easier.
        
        pers-addr           = addr-spec
                              ;addr-spec defined in [RFC-822]
        
    personality.Server.SMTP
        This specifies the [SMTP] server to be used when sending
        messages for this personality.  Generally, the form is an [SMTP]
        URL, as defined in Section 8.
        
        pers-smtp           = url ;defined in [URL-BASIC]
        
    personality.Signature.Text
        This contains the signature text to be appended by default to
        new messages.  It is stored in canonical form, with
        CRLF-separated lines.  When a signature separator line is used,
        it SHOULD NOT be contained in this attribute, but instead added
        automatically by the client.
        
        pers-sig-text       = 1*CHAR
        
    personality.Signature.URL
        When the signature to be appended by default to new messages is
        stored in a file or other resource, this attribute is used
        instead of "personality.Signature.Text".  This attribute
        contains a URL (for example, a file URL) to the signature text.
        It is assumed that the signature text is in canonical form, with
        CRLF-separated lines.  When a signature separator line is used,
        it SHOULD NOT be contained in this file, but instead added
        automatically by the client.
        
        pers-sig-url        = url ;defined in [URL-BASIC]
        
    personality.Stationery
        This attribute contains a URL (for example, a file URL) to the
        stationery, or template, to be used when creating new messages
        with this personality.  In general the stationery contains a
        canonicalized message, with header fields and/or body.
        
        pers-statn          = url ;defined in [URL-BASIC]

    personality.SMTP-Auth.permitted.clear
        This attribute specifies if clear-text [SMTP-AUTH] mechanisms
        are permitted.  A value of "never" indicates such mechanisms can
        never be used for this personality.  A value of "encrypted"
        gives permission to use such mechanisms if an encrypted channel
        is in effect, such as [TLS] or [IPSEC].  A value of "always"
        permits such mechanisms to be used under all conditions.
        
        Note that use of clear-text mechanisms poses at least two
        different risks: one is that the password may be captured
        in-transit (which can be mitigated by using an encryption
        layer); the second is that the password may be disclosed to an
        inappropriate server.
        
        pers-auth-clear       = "never" / "encrypted" / "always"
        
    personality.SMTP-Auth.permitted.nonclear
        This attribute specifies if non-clear-text [SMTP-AUTH]
        mechanisms (such as CRAM-MD5, Kerberos, or One Time Password)
        are permitted.  A value of "never" indicates such mechanisms can
        never be used for this personality.  A value of "always" permits
        such mechanisms to be used under all conditions.
        
        Note that some non-clear-text mechanisms are vulnerable to
        various attacks which could result in an unauthorized server
        obtaining the user's password.
        
        pers-auth-nonclear    = "never" / "always"

8.  The SMTP URL Scheme
    
    The SMTP URL scheme designates an [SMTP] server, and optionally a
    port number, authentication mechanism, authentication ID, and/or
    authorization ID.
    
    The SMTP URL follows the common Internet scheme syntax as defined in
    RFC 1738 [BASIC-URL] except that clear text passwords are not
    permitted.  If :<port> is omitted, the port defaults to 25.
    
    The SMTP URL is described using [ABNF] in section 8.5.
    
    An SMTP URL is of the general form:
    
    smtp:<user>;auth=<auth>@<host>:<port>
    
    Where <user>, <host>, and <port> are as defined in RFC 1738, and
    some or all of the elements, except "smtp:" and <host>, may be
    omitted.
    
    
8.1.  SMTP User Name and Authentication Mechanism
    
    An authorization (which [SMTP] account to access) and authentication
    (whose password to check against) identity (referred to as "user
    name" for simplicity) and/or authentication mechanism name may be
    supplied.  These are used in an AUTH [SMTP-AUTH], or extension
    command after making the connection to the SMTP server.  If the URL
    doesn't supply an authentication identifier, the program
    interpreting the SMTP URL MAY request one from the user.
    
    An authentication mechanism can be expressed by adding ";AUTH=<enc-
    auth-type>" to the end of the user name.  If the authentication
    mechanism name is not preceded by a "+", it is a SASL SMTP [SASL]
    mechanism.  If it is preceded by a "+", it is an extension
    mechanism.

Internet Draft    ACAP Email Personality Dataset Class    February 2003


    When an <enc-auth-type> is specified, the client SHOULD request
    appropriate credentials from that mechanism and use the "AUTH", (or
    extension) command.  If no user name is specified and an
    <enc-auth-type> is specified, a user name SHOULD be obtained from
    the mechanism or requested from the user as appropriate.
    
    The string ";AUTH=*" indicates that the client SHOULD select an
    appropriate authentication mechanism.  It MAY use any mechanism
    supported by the [SMTP] server.
    
    If an <enc-auth-type> other than ";AUTH=*" is specified, the client
    SHOULD NOT use a different mechanism without explicit user
    permission.
    
    If a user name is included with no authentication mechanism, then
    ";AUTH=*" is assumed.
    
    Since URLs can easily come from untrusted sources, care must be
    taken when resolving a URL which requires or requests any sort of
    authentication.  If authentication credentials are supplied to the
    wrong server, it may compromise the security of the user's account.
    The program resolving the URL should make sure it meets at least one
    of the following criteria in this case:
    
    (1) The URL comes from a trusted source, such as a referral server
    which the client has validated and trusts according to site policy.
    Note that user entry of the URL may or may not count as a trusted
    source, depending on the experience level of the user and site
    policy.
    
    (2) Explicit local site policy permits the client to connect to the
    server in the URL.  For example, if the client knows the site domain
    name, site policy may dictate that any hostname ending in that
    domain is trusted.
    
    (3) The user confirms that connecting to that domain name with the
    specified credentials and/or mechanism is permitted.
    
    (4) A mechanism is used which validates the server before passing
    potentially compromising client credentials.
    
    (5) An authentication mechanism is used which will not reveal
    information to the server which could be used to compromise future
    connections.

    A URL containing ";AUTH=*" should be treated with extra care since
    it might fall back on a weaker security mechanism.  Finally, clients
    are discouraged from using a plain text password as a fallback with
    ";AUTH=*" unless the connection has strong encryption (e.g., a key
    length of greater than 56 bits).
    
    Note that if unsafe or reserved characters such as " " or ";" are
    present in the user name or authentication mechanism, they MUST be
    encoded as described in RFC 1738 [BASIC-URL].
    
8.2.  Relative SMTP URLs
    
    Relative SMTP URLs are not permitted.
    
8.3.  Multinational Considerations
    
    Since 8-bit characters are not permitted in URLs, [UTF8] characters
    are encoded as required by the URL specification [BASIC-URL].
    
8.4.  Example
    
    The following example demonstrate how an SMTP client program might
    translate various SMTP URLs into a series of SMTP commands.
    Commands sent from the client to the server are prefixed with "C:",
    and responses sent from the server to the client are prefixed with
    "S:".
    
    
    The URL:
    
            <smtp:rg;AUTH=CRAM-MD5@smtp.example.com:8025>
    
        Results in the following client commands:
    
        <client requests password from user>
        <connect to smtp.example.com, port 8025>
         S: 220 smtp.example.com ESMTP server ready
         C: EHLO jgm.example.com
         S: 250-smtp.example.com
         S: 250 AUTH CRAM-MD5 DIGEST-MD5
         C: AUTH CRAM-MD5
         S: 334
         PENCeUxFREJoU0NnbmhNWitOMjNGNndAZWx3b29kLmlubm9zb2Z0LmNvbT4=
         C: ZnJlZCA5ZTk1YWVlMDljNDBhZjJiODRhMGMyYjNiYmFlNzg2ZQ==
         S: 235 Authentication successful.

8.5.  ABNF for SMTP URL scheme
    
        The SMTP URL scheme is described using [ABNF]:
    
        achar            = uchar / "&" / "=" / "~"
                                ; see [BASIC-URL] for "uchar" definition

        auth             = ";AUTH=" ( "*" / enc-auth-type )

        enc-auth-type    = enc-sasl / enc-ext

        enc-ext          = "+" 1*achar
                              ;encoded extension mechanism name

        enc-sasl         = 1*achar
                              ;encoded version of [SASL] "auth_type"

        enc-user         = 1*achar
                              ;encoded version of SMTP mailbox

        smtp-url         = "smtp:" server

        server           = [user-auth "@"] hostport
                              ;See [BASIC-URL] for "hostport" definition

        user-auth        = enc-user [auth]
    
    
8.6.  Security Considerations
    
        Security considerations discussed in the [SMTP-AUTH]
    specification and the [BASIC-URL] specification are relevant.
    Security considerations related to authenticated URLs are discussed
    in section 8.1 of this document.
    
        Many email clients store the plain text password for later use
    after logging into a server.  Such clients MUST NOT use a stored
    password in response to an SMTP URL without explicit permission from
    the user to supply that password to the specified host name.

11.  Security Considerations
    
        As with ACAP datasets in general, it is important that access
    controls are set correctly on Email Personality datasets.
    Attributes may contain highly personal information which should not
    be disclosed except by explicit owner request.  In addition, by
    changing certain attributes (such as
    "personality.SMTP-Auth.permitted.clear",
    "personality.SMTP-Auth.permitted.nonclear", and
    "personality.server.SMTP"), an attacker could cause a user to
    attempt an unsafe and unwise authentication, including potentially
    sending the user's password in the clear to a rogue server.
    
        The "personality.SMTP-Auth.permitted.clear" attribute mentions
    twoof the risks associated with sending clear-text passwords to an
    SMTP server.
    
        The "personality.SMTP-Auth.permitted.nonclear" attribute
    mentions one of the risks associated with using non-clear-text
    authentication mechanisms.
    
        Security considerations for SMTP URLs are discussed in section
    8.6.
