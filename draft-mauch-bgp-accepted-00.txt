1.  Introduction

   BGP [RFC4271] operators face challenges when attempting to
   troubleshoot external BGP sessions.  Commonly operators debug BGP
   sessions with commands that display the results of advertised or
   received routes.

   When operating a network, you can easily verify you are sending
   routes to a BGP peer, but you have limited ability to understand the
   external partner device.  Common debugging tools such as a looking
   glass or contacting a remote operator via e-mail, telephone or other
   out of band methods is required.

   This proposal intends to provide an automated method to see the NLRI
   eligible for selection that pass any filtering methods provided by
   the peer software stack.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as
   shown here.

3.  Solution

   The requesting device will send a BGP message of type XXX to the
   partner device requesting the list of the NLRI. (excerpted from
   rfc2918)

             Message Format: One AFI, SAFI encoded as

                     0       7      15      23      31
                     +-------+-------+-------+-------+
                     |      AFI      | Res.  | SAFI  |
                     +-------+-------+-------+-------+

   The meaning, use and encoding of this AFI, SAFI field is the same as
   defined in [BGP-MP, sect. 7].  More specifically,

   AFI - Address Family Identifier (16 bit).

   Res. - Reserved (8 bit) field.  Should be set to 0 by the sender and
   ignored by the receiver.

   SAFI - Subsequent Address Family Identifier (8 bit).

   Responses will include:


             Message Format: per

                     0       15      31      47      64
                     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
                     |   accepted    |    rejected   |
                     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Count of NLRI accepted (unsigned 32-bits)

   Count of NLRI rejected (unsigned 32-bits)

   List of NLRI accepted (NLRI list in same format as UPDATE)

   List of NLRI rejected (NLRI list in same format as UPDATE -
   infeasible)

4.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank the following people for their
   comments and support: XXX.

5.  Security Considerations

   This message MAY be subject to rate-limits by a partner device to
   protect itself from CPU or other resource exhaustion.  A suggested
   interval is to not permit more than one request per 60 seconds.
