<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
The much larger default 64-bit subnet address space of IPv6
should in principle make traditional network (port) scanning techniques used
by certain network worms or scanning tools less effective.
While 
traditional network scanning probes (whether by individuals or automated 
via network worms) may become less common, administrators should be aware
that attackers may use other techniques to discover IPv6 addresses 
on a target network, and thus they should also be aware of measures that
are available to mitigate against them.   This informational document 
discusses approaches that administrators could
take when planning their site address allocation and management
strategies as part of a defence-in-depth approach to network security.

Introduction</h3>

<p>
One of the key differences between IPv4 and IPv6 is the much larger address 
space for IPv6, which also goes hand-in-hand with much larger subnet sizes.
This change has a significant impact on the feasibility of TCP and UDP
network scanning, whereby an automated process is run to detect open ports
(services) on systems that may then be subject of a subsequent 
attack.   Today many IPv4 sites are subjected to such probing on a recurring 
basis.   Such probing is common in part due to the relatively dense 
population of active hosts in any given chunk of IPv4 address space.
	
</p>
<p>
The 128 bits of 
<a class='info' href='#RFC2460'>IPv6<span> (</span><span class='info'>Deering, S. and R. Hinden, &ldquo;Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification,&rdquo; December&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2460]
address space is considerably bigger than the 32 bits
of address space in IPv4.   In particular, the IPv6 subnets to which hosts
attach will by default have 
<a class='info' href='#RFC4862'>64 bits of host address space<span> (</span><span class='info'>Thomson, S., Narten, T., and T. Jinmei, &ldquo;IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4862].   
As a result, traditional methods of remote TCP or UDP network scanning to 
discover open or running services on a host will potentially become 
less feasible, due to the larger search space in the subnet.   Similarly,
worms that rely on off-link network scanning to propagate may also be
potentially be more limited in impact.
This 
document discusses this property of IPv6, and describes related issues 
for IPv6 site network administrators to consider, which may be useful
when planning site address allocation and management strategies.  
	
</p>
<p>
For example, many worms, like Slammer, rely
on such address scanning methods to propagate, whether they pick subnets 
numerically (and thus probably topologically) close to the current victim, 
or subnets in random remote networks.   The nature of these worms may
change, if detection of target hosts between sites or subnets is harder to
achieve by traditional methods.   However, there are other worms that propagate
via methods such as email, for which the methods discussed in this text
are not relevant.
	
</p>
<p>
It must be remembered that the defence of a network must not rely solely on
the unpredictable sparseness of the host addresses on that network.   
Such a feature or property is
only one measure in a set of measures that may be applied.   This
document discusses various measures that can be used by a site to 
mitigate against attacks as part of an overall strategy.   Some of these
have a lower cost to deploy than others.    For example, if numbering hosts
on a subnet, it may be as cheap to number hosts without any predictable
pattern as it is to number them sequentially.   In contrast, use of
<a class='info' href='#RFC4941'>IPv6 Privacy Extensions<span> (</span><span class='info'>Narten, T., Draves, R., and S. Krishnan, &ldquo;Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4941]
may complicate network management (identifying
which hosts use which addresses).   
	
</p>
<p>
This document complements the transition-centric
discussion of the issues that can be found in Appendix A of the
IPv6 Transition/Co-existence Security Considerations text
<a class='info' href='#RFC4942'>[RFC4942]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Davies, E., Krishnan, S., and P. Savola, &ldquo;IPv6 Transition/Co-existence Security Considerations,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>, which takes a broad view of security
issues for transitioning networks.
The reader is also referred to a recent paper by Bellovin on network
worm propagation 
strategies in IPv6 networks <a class='info' href='#bellovin'>[bellovin]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bellovin, S. et al, &ldquo;Worm Propagation Strategies in an IPv6 Internet (http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smb/papers/v6worms.pdf),&rdquo; ;login:, February&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>.    This paper discusses
some of the issues included in this document, from a slightly different
perspective.

Target Address Space for Network Scanning</h3>

<p>
There are significantly different considerations for the feasibility of
plain, brute force IPv4 and IPv6 address scanning.

<a name="rfc.section.2.1"></a><h3>2.1.&nbsp;
IPv4</h3>

<p>
A typical IPv4 subnet may have 8 bits reserved for host addressing.
In such a case, a remote attacker need only probe at most 256 addresses
to determine if a particular service is running publicly on a host in that
subnet.   Even at only one probe per second, such a scan would take under 
5 minutes to complete.

<a name="rfc.section.2.2"></a><h3>2.2.&nbsp;
IPv6</h3>

<p>
A typical IPv6 subnet will have 64 bits reserved for host addressing.
In such a case, a remote attacker in principle needs to probe 2^64 addresses 
to determine if a particular open service is running on a host in that
subnet.   At a very conservative 
one probe per second, such a scan may take some 5 billion
years to complete.  A more rapid probe will still be limited to (effectively)
infinite time for the whole address space.   However, there are ways for
the attacker to reduce the address search space to scan against within 
the target subnet, as we discuss below.
	
</p>

<a name="rfc.section.2.3"></a><h3>2.3.&nbsp;
Reducing the IPv6 Search Space</h3>

<p>
The IPv6 host address space through which an attacker may search can be
reduced in at least two ways.   
	
</p>
<p>
First, the attacker may rely on the 
administrator conveniently numbering their hosts from
[prefix]::1 upward.   This makes scanning trivial, and thus should
be avoided unless the host's address is readily obtainable from 
other sources (for example it is the site's published 
primary DNS or email MX 
server).   Alternatively if hosts are numbered sequentially, or using
any regular scheme, knowledge of one address may expose other available
addresses to scan.
        
</p>
<p>
Second, in the case of 
<a class='info' href='#RFC2460'>statelessly autoconfiguring<span> (</span><span class='info'>Deering, S. and R. Hinden, &ldquo;Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification,&rdquo; December&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2460] hosts, the
host part of the address will usually take a well-known format that includes
the Ethernet vendor prefix and the &quot;fffe&quot; stuffing.  For such
hosts, the search space can be reduced to 48 bits.   Further, if the 
Ethernet vendor is also known, the search space may be reduced
to 24 bits, with a one probe per second scan then taking a less daunting
194 days.  Even where the exact vendor is not known, using a set of common 
vendor prefixes can reduce the search.  In addition, many nodes in a
site network may be procured in batches, and thus have sequential or
near sequential MAC addresses; if one node's autoconfigured address is known,
scanning around that address may yield results for the attacker.
Again, any form of sequential host addressing should be avoided if possible.

<a name="rfc.section.2.4"></a><h3>2.4.&nbsp;
Dual-stack Networks</h3>

<p>
Full advantage of the increased IPv6 address space in terms of resilience
to network scanning may not be gained until IPv6-only networks
and devices become more commonplace, given that most IPv6 hosts are currently
dual stack, with (more readily scannable) IPv4 connectivity.   
However, many applications or services
(e.g. new peer-to-peer applications) on the (dual stack) hosts may 
emerge that are only accessible
over IPv6, and that thus can only be discovered by IPv6 address scanning.

<a name="rfc.section.2.5"></a><h3>2.5.&nbsp;
Defensive Scanning</h3>

<p>
The problem faced by the attacker for an IPv6 network is also faced by
a site administrator looking for vulnerabilities in their own network's
systems.    The administrator should have the advantage of being on-link for
scanning purposes though.

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
Alternatives for Attackers: Off-link</h3>

<p>
If IPv6 hosts in subnets are allocated addresses 'randomly', and as a result
IPv6 network scanning becomes relatively infeasible, attackers will need to 
find new methods to identify IPv6 addresses for subsequent scanning.
In this section, we discuss some possible paths attackers may take.  In
these cases, the attacker will attempt to identify specific IPv6 addresses
for subsequent targeted probes.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1"></a><h3>3.1.&nbsp;
Gleaning IPv6 prefix information</h3>

<p>
Note that in IPv6 an attacker would not be able to search across 
the entire IPv6 address space as they might in IPv4.
An attacker may learn general prefixes to focus their efforts on
by observing route view information (e.g. from public looking glass
services) or information on allocated address space from RIRs.  
In general this would only yield information at most at the /48 prefix
granularity, but specific /64 prefixes may be observed from route
views on some parts of some networks.

DNS Advertised Hosts</h3>

<p>
Any servers that are DNS listed, e.g. MX mail relays, or web servers, 
will remain open to probing from the very fact that their IPv6 addresses
will be published in the DNS.    
	
</p>
<p>
While servers are relatively easy to find because they are DNS-published,
any systems that are not DNS-published will be much harder to locate
via traditional scanning than is the case for IPv4 networks.   It is
worth noting that where a site uses sequential host numbering,
publishing just one address may lead to a threat upon the other hosts.

DNS Zone Transfers</h3>

<p>
In the IPv6 world a DNS zone transfer is much more
likely to narrow the number of hosts an attacker needs to target.   This 
implies restricting
zone transfers is (more) important for IPv6, even if it is already good
practice to restrict them in the IPv4 world.
	
</p>
<p>
There are some projects that provide Internet mapping data
from access to such transfers.   Administrators may of course agree
to provide such transfers where they choose to do so.

Log File Analysis</h3>

IPv6 addresses may be harvested from recorded logs such as web site logs.

channel for an attacker, e.g. by inspection of the (many) Received from:

Application Participation</h3>

<p>
More recent peer-to-peer applications often include some centralised
server which coordinates the transfer of data between peers.  The
BitTorrent application builds swarms of nodes that exchange chunks of
files, with a tracker passing information about peers with available
chunks of data between the peers.  Such applications may offer an attacker
a source of peer IP addresses to probe.

or other techniques that derive low-order bits
from IPv4 addresses (though in this case, unless they are using IPv4 NAT, 
the IPv4 addresses may be probed anyway).  
	
</p>
<p>
For example, the current
Microsoft 6to4 implementation uses the address 2002:V4ADDR::V4ADDR 
while older Linux and FreeBSD implementations default to 2002:V4ADDR::1.
This leads to specific knowledge of specific hosts in the network.
Given one host in the network is observed as using a given transition 
technique, it is likely that there are more.
	
</p>
<p>
In the case of Teredo, the 64 bit node identifier is generated from
the IPv4 address observed at a Teredo server along with a UDP port
number.   The Teredo specification also allows for discovery of other
Teredo clients on the same IPv4 subnet via a well-known IPv4 multicast
address (see Section 2.17 of <a class='info' href='#RFC4380'>RFC4380<span> (</span><span class='info'>Huitema, C., &ldquo;Teredo: Tunneling IPv6 over UDP through Network Address Translations (NATs),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4380]).

Alternatives for Attackers: On-link</h3>

<p>
The main thrust of this text is considerations for off-link attackers
or probing of a network.   In general,  once one host on a link is
compromised, others on the link can be very readily discovered.

<a name="rfc.section.4.1"></a><h3>4.1.&nbsp;
General on-link methods</h3>

<p>
If the attacker already has access to a system on the current subnet, 
then traffic on that subnet, be it Neighbour
Discovery or application based traffic, can invariably
be observed, and active node addresses within the local subnet learnt.   
	
</p>
<p>
In addition to making observations of traffic on the link,
IPv6-enabled hosts on local subnets may be discovered through probing
the &quot;all hosts&quot; link local multicast address.   Likewise any
routers on the subnet may be found via the &quot;all routers&quot; link local
multicast address.    An attacker may choose to probe in a slightly
more obfuscated way by probing the solicited node multicast address
of a potential target host.
	
</p>
<p>
Where a host has already been compromised, its Neighbour Discovery cache
is also likely to include information about active nodes on the current
subnet, just
as an ARP cache would do for IPv4.
	
</p>
<p>
Also, depending on the node, traffic to or from other
nodes (in particular server systems) is likely to show up if an attacker
can gain a presence on a node in any one subnet in a site's network.

Tools to Mitigate Against Scanning Attacks</h3>

<p>
There are some tools that site administrators can apply to make the
task for IPv6 network scanning attackers harder.   These methods arise
from the considerations in the previous section.   

</p>
<p>
The author notes that at his current (university) site, there is no
evidence of general network scanning running across subnets.  However, 
there is network scanning over IPv6 connections to systems whose IPv6
addresses are advertised (DNS servers, MX relays, web servers, etc),
which are presumably looking for other open ports on these hosts to 
probe.
At the time of writing, DHCPv6
<a class='info' href='#RFC3315'>DHCPv6<span> (</span><span class='info'>Droms, R., Bound, J., Volz, B., Lemon, T., Perkins, C., and M. Carney, &ldquo;Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6),&rdquo; July&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3315] is not yet in use, and clients use
stateless autoconfiguration.   Therefore the author's site does not
yet have sequentially numbered client hosts deployed as may typically
seen in today's IPv4 DHCP-served networks.

</p>
<a name="anchor20"></a><br /><hr />
<table summary="layout" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" class="TOCbug" align="right"><tr><td class="TOCbug"><a href="#toc">&nbsp;TOC&nbsp;</a></td></tr></table>
<a name="rfc.section.5.1"></a><h3>5.1.&nbsp;
IPv6 Privacy Addresses</h3>

<p>
Hosts in a network using 
<a class='info' href='#RFC4941'>IPv6 Privacy Extensions<span> (</span><span class='info'>Narten, T., Draves, R., and S. Krishnan, &ldquo;Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4941] 
will typically only connect to external systems using their
current (temporary) privacy address.   The precise behaviour of a
host with a stable global address and one or more dynamic privacy address(es)
when selecting a source address to use may be operating-system specific,
or configuarable, but typical behaviour when initiating a connection is
use of a privacy address when available.
	
</p>
<p>
While an attacker may be able to port
scan a privacy address if they do so quickly upon observing or otherwise
learning of the address,
the threat or risk is reduced due to the time-constrained value of the
address.  One implementation of RFC4941 
already deployed has privacy addresses active (used by the node) 
for one day, with such addresses reachable for seven days.    
	
</p>
<p>
Note that an RFC4941 host will usually also have a
separate static global IPv6 address by which it can also be reached, and
that may be DNS-advertised if an externally reachable service is running
on it.   DHCPv6 can be used to serve normal global addresses and IPv6
Privacy Addresses.
	
</p>
<p>
The implication is that while
Privacy Addresses can mitigate the long-term value of harvested addresses,
an attacker creating an IPv6 application server to which clients connect
will still be able to probe the clients by their Privacy Address as and when
they visit that server.  
The duration for which Privacy Addresses are valid will impact on the
usefulness of such observed addresses to an external attacker.
For example, a worm that may spread using such observed addresses may
be less effective if it relies on harvested privacy addresses.
The frequency with which such
address get recycled could be increased, though this may increase the
complexity of local network management for the administrator, since doing
so will cause more addresses to be used over time in the site.
	
</p>
<p>
A further option here may be to consider using different addresses for
specific applications, or even each new application instance, which
may reduce exposure to other services running on the same host when 
such an address is observed externally.

Non-use of MAC addresses in EUI-64 format</h3>

<p>
The EUI-64 identifier format does not require the use of MAC addresses for
identifier construction.   At least one well-known operating system currently
defaults to generation of the 64 bit interface identifier by use of 
random bits, and thus does not embed the MAC address.   Where such
a method exists as an option, an administrator may wish consider use of
that option.

DHCP Service Configuration Options</h3>

<p>
One option open to an administrator is to
configure DHCPv6, if possible, so that the first addresses
allocated from the pool begins much higher in the address space than
at [prefix]::1.  
Further, it is desirable that allocated addresses are not sequential, nor have
any predictable pattern to them.   Unpredictable sparseness in the allocated
addresses is a desirable property.  DHCPv6 implementers could reduce the
cost for administrators to deploy such 'random' addressing by supporting
configuration options to allow such behaviour.

DHCPv6 also includes an option to use <a class='info' href='#RFC4941'>Privacy

<a name="rfc.section.6"></a><h3>6.&nbsp;
Conclusions</h3>

<p>
Due to the much larger size of IPv6 subnets in comparison to IPv4 it
will become less feasible for traditional 
network scanning methods to detect open
services for subsequent attacks, assuming the attackers are off-site and 
services are not listed in the DNS.   If administrators number their IPv6
subnets in 'random', non-predictable ways, attackers, whether they be
in the form of automated network scanners or dynamic worm propagation, will 
need to make wider use of new methods to determine IPv6 host addresses 
to target (e.g. looking to obtain logs of activity from a site and scanning
addresses around the ones observed).  
Such numbering schemes may be very low cost to deploy in comparison to
conventional sequential numbering, and thus a useful part of an 
overall defence-in-depth strategy.
Of course, if those systems are dual-stack, and have open IPv4 services
running, they will remain exposed to traditional probes over IPv4 transport.

Security Considerations</h3>

There are no specific security considerations in this document outside
of the topic of discussion itself.  However,
it must be noted that the 'security through obscurity' discussions
and commentary within this text must be noted in their proper context.
Relying purely on obscurity of a node address is not prudent, rather
the advice here should be considered as part of a 'defence-in-depth'
approach to security for a site or network.   This also implies that these
measures require coordination between network administrators and those
who maintain DNS services, though that is common in most scenarios.
