Abstract 

   This document introduces a TCP performance evaluation tool for the 
   network simulator NS2.  This tool is motivated by the observation 
   that there is significant overlap among (but lack of an agreed set  
   of) the topologies, traffic, and metrics used by many researchers   
   in the evaluation of TCP alternatives: effort could be saved by

   starting research from an existing framework.  As such, our tool 
   includes several typical topologies and traffic models; it measures 
   some of the most important metrics commonly used in TCP evaluation; 
   and it can automatically generate simulation statistics and graphs 
   ready for inclusion in latex and html documents.  The tool also 
   contains an extendable open-source framework.  With community effort, 
   we hope the tool evolves into a widely accepted, well-defined set of 
   TCP performance evaluation benchmarks.

1. Introduction 

   Issues regarding the behavior of TCP in high-speed, long-distance 
   networks have recently attracted wide attention.  The Additive-
   Increase-Multiplicative-Decrease (AIMD) congestion control algorithm 
   employed by TCP [1] is designed to share network resources among 
   competing users fairly and efficiently.  However, research results 
   show that TCP does not perform very well in high-speed, long-distance 
   networks [2].  To solve this problem, many TCP variants have been 
   proposed.  These include HighSpeed TCP (HSTCP) [3], Scalable TCP 
   (STCP) [4], FAST [10], Binary Increase Control (BIC) TCP [5], CUBIC 
   TCP [6], H-TCP [7], XCP [8], and VCP [9], etc.  The proliferation of 
   these many options logically brings the following question: what is 
   the most effective high speed transport protocol for general use? 

   In order to answer this question, a number of performance evaluations 
   for the high speed TCP variants have been conducted.  These include 
   simulations [11, 12] using the network simulator NS2 [13], test-bed 
   analysis [14] and real world experiments [15].  Although test-beds 
   and real world experiments can produce much more realistic results 
   than simulations, implementing a large and complex experimental 
   scenario is challenging.  Therefore, many researchers employ NS2 
   simulations to test their ideas in the early stage of protocol  
   design.  Typically, each researcher writes his/her own NS2 scripts, 
   and much time is spent duplicating similar network topologies, 
   traffic models and performance metrics.  On the other hand, the 
   community still lacks a set of ready-made tests to reveal common 
   flaws during early development, and a set of automated benchmarks to 
   serve as a meaningful comparison between schemes proposed by 
   different research groups.  One might ask: why don't we avoid wheel 
   reinvention and form a community project to this end? 

   This document introduces a project [22, 21] which implements an 
   extendable tool that automates the NS2 TCP simulation process as much 
   as possible.  Using this tool, one just needs to simply define 
   simulation scenarios (including network topology, traffic model and 
   performance metrics); the simulation results (statistics and graphs) 
   are automatically generated.  The tool is very easy to use and  
   extend.  It can save a lot of time spent in writing NS2 simulation 
   scripts.  More important, we expect that, over the time, the 
   scenarios collectively defined by the users of this tool will 
   converge onto a set of community-acceptable TCP performance 
   evaluation benchmarks, which will in turn be used by each individual 
   researcher.

   This tool includes a suite of NS2 simulation scripts that: 

     1. Automate simulation and post-processing procedures; 

     2. Define a set of commonly used network topologies, traffic models 
        and performance evaluation metrics. 

   This tool can be used not only for high-speed TCP protocols, but for 
   other proposed changes to congestion control mechanisms as well, such 
   as ECN added to SYN/ACK packets, changes to make small transfers more 
   robust, changes in RTO estimation, and proposals to distinguish 
   between loss due to congestion or corruption, etc. 

   This simulation tool does not attempt to be final.  Instead, it 
   intends to serve as a starting point.  We invite community members to 
   contribute to the project by helping extend this tool toward a 
   comprehensive set of NS2 TCP evaluation benchmarks.

2. Tool Components 

   The architecture of our tool is shown in Fig. 1, which is primarily 
   composed of the following components: network topologies, traffic 
   models, performance evaluation metrics, and, after a simulation is 
   done, a set of result statistics and graphs generated. 

    

2.1. Network Topologies 

   The tool includes three commonly used topologies in TCP performance 
   evaluations.  They are single-bottleneck dumb-bell, multiple-
   bottleneck parking-lot, and a simple network topology.  More 
   realistic and complex topologies can be added to the tool easily. 

    

2.1.1. A Single-Bottleneck Dumb-Bell Topology 

   This is shown in Fig. 2, in which source nodes and sink nodes connect 
   to router 1 or router 2.  The bandwidth between the two routers is 
   much lower than the other links, which causes the link between the 
   routers to be a bottleneck.  (Traffic can be either uni-directional 
   or bi-directional.) 

    

               Src_1                                    Sink_1 
                    \                                  /

                     /                                \ 
                    /                                  \ 
               Src_N                                    Sink_N 
    
                      Figure 2  A dumb-bell topology. 

    

2.1.2. A Multiple-Bottleneck Parking-Lot Topology 

   The parking-lot topology shown in Fig. 3 is similar to the dumb-bell 
   topology except that it introduces cross traffic traversing the 
   intermediate routers.

2.1.3. A Simple Network Topology 

   A simple network topology is illustrated in Fig. 4.  In this 
   configuration, the core routers represent the backbone of the network 
   with the access routers responsible for sender or receiver nodes to 
   connect to the network.  It is similar to the transit and stub 
   domains in GT-ITM [16].  Static routing is employed as the default 
   routing protocol.

2.2. Traffic Models 

   The tool attempts to apply the typical traffic settings.  The 
   applications involved include four common traffic types. 

    

2.2.1. Long-lived FTP Traffic 

   FTP traffic uses infinite, non-stop file transmission, which begins 
   at a random time and runs on the top of TCP.  Implementation details 
   and choice of TCP variants are decided by users, which is not in the 
   scope of this tool. 

    

2.2.2. Short-lived Web Traffic 

   The web traffic module employs the PackMime HTTP traffic generator 
   [17], which is available in the recent NS2 releases. 

    

2.2.3. Streaming Video Traffic 

   Streaming traffic is modeled using CBR traffic over UDP.  Both 
   sending rate and packet size are settable. 

    

2.2.4. Interactive Voice Traffic 

   There are currently two synthetic voice traffic generation methods 
   available in this tool.  One is based on CBR-like streaming traffic.  
   The other is generated according to a two-state ON/OFF model, in 
   which ON and OFF states are exponentially distributed.  The mean ON 
   period is 1.0 sec, and the mean OFF duration is 1.35 sec.  These 
   values are set in accordance with ITU-T recommendations [18], but are 
   changeable if needed. 

   The voice packet size is 200 bytes, including the 160 bytes data 
   packet (codec G711, 64 kbps rate and 20 ms duration), 20 byte IP 
   header, 8 byte UDP header, and 12 byte RTP header.  These parameters 
   can be changed by using other voice/audio codecs.

2.3. Performance Metrics 

   A comprehensive list of the metrics for TCP performance evaluation is 
   described in [19].  In the first step, this tool tries to implement 
   some commonly used metrics described in [19].  Here we follow [19] 
   and classify the metrics into network metrics and application  
   metrics.  They are listed as follows. 

    

2.3.1. Throughput, Delay, Jitter and Loss Rate 

2.3.1.1. Throughput 

   For network metrics, we collect bottleneck link utilization as the 
   aggregate link throughput. 

   Throughput is sometimes different from goodput, because goodput 
   consists solely of useful transmitted traffic, where throughput may 
   also include retransmitted traffic [19].  But users care more about 
   the useful bits the network can provide.  So the tool collects 
   application level end-to-end goodput no matter what the transport 
   protocol is employed. 

   For long-lived FTP traffic, it measures the transmitted traffic 
   during some intervals in bits per second. 

   For short-lived web traffic, the PackMime HTTP model collects 
   request/response goodput and response time to measure web traffic 
   performance. 

   Voice and video traffic are different from above.  Their performance 
   is affected by packet delay, delay jitter and packet loss rate as 
   well as goodput.  So their goodput is measured in transmitted packet 
   rate excluding lost packets and delayed packets in excess of a 
   predefined delay threshold. 

    

2.3.1.2. Delay 

   We use bottleneck queue size as an indication of queuing delay in 
   bottlenecks.  Besides mean and max/min queue size statistics, we also 
   use percentile queue size to indicate the queue length during most of 
   the time. 

 
 
Wang, Xia and Harrison                                       [Page 8] 

Internet-Draft         TMRG, Evaluation, Tool               April 2007 
 

 

   FTP traffic is not affected much by packet transmission delay. 

   For web traffic, we report on the response time, defined as the 
   duration between the client's sending out requests and receiving the 
   response from the server. 

   For streaming and interactive traffic, packet delay is a one-way 
   measurement, as defined by the duration between sending and receiving 
   at the end nodes. 

    

2.3.1.3. Jitter 

   Delay jitter is quite important for delay sensitive traffic, such as 
   voice and video.  Large jitter requires much more buffer size at the 
   receiver side and may cause high loss rates in strict delay 
   requirements.  We employ standard packet delay deviation to show 
   jitter for interactive and streaming traffic. 

    

2.3.1.4. Loss Rate 

   To obtain network statistics, we measure the bottleneck queue loss 
   rate. 

   We do not collect loss rates for FTP and web traffic because they are 
   less affected by this metric. 

   For interactive and streaming traffic, high packet loss rates result 
   in the failure of the receiver to decode the packet.  In this tool, 
   they are measured during specified intervals.  The received packet is 
   considered lost if its delay is beyond a predefined threshold. 

    

2.3.2. Response Times and Oscillations 

   One of the key concerns in the design of congestion control 
   mechanisms has been the response time to sudden network changes.  On 
   the one hand, the mechanism should respond rapidly to changes in the 
   network environment.  On the other hand, it has to make sure changes 
   are not too severe to ensure the stability of the network [19].  This 
   tool is designed so the response time and fluctuations can be easily 
   observed using a series of figures it generates, if the simulation

Internet-Draft         TMRG, Evaluation, Tool               April 2007 
 

 

   scenarios we use include variable bandwidth, round trip delay, 
   various traffic start times and other parameters. 

    

2.3.3. Fairness and Convergence 

   In this tool, the fairness measurement uses Jain's fairness index  
   [20] to measure the fair bandwidth share of end-to-end FTP flows  
   that traverse the same route. 

   Convergence times are the time elapsed between multiple flows from an 
   unfair share of link bandwidth to a fair state.  They are quite 
   important for environments with high-bandwidth, long-delay flows.  
   This tool includes scenarios to test the convergence performance. 

    

2.3.4. Robustness in Challenging Environments 

   A static link packet error model has been introduced in the tool to 
   investigate TCP performance in challenging environments.  Link 
   failure, routing changes and other diagnostic markers can easily be 
   tested by changing the tool's parameters. 

    

2.4. Simulation Results 

   The tool includes a package [21] to automatically generate the above-
   discussed performance metrics.  At the end of a simulation, it also 
   automatically generates a series of user-defined statistics (e.g. 
   bottleneck average utilization, bottleneck 90-percentile queue  
   length, average per-flow goodput, etc.) and graphs (like bottleneck 
   utilization and queue length variation over time, per-flow throughput 
   over time, etc).  It can create latex and html files in order to 
   present the simulation results in a paper or webpage form.  All the 
   simulation-generated data is stored in a temporary directory for 
   later use. 

    

3. Usage Description 

   Here we present a brief description on how to use this software.   
   For the details the reader is referred to the manual available at 
 
 
Wang, Xia and Harrison                                      [Page 10]

   [22].  The main body of this tool includes three files: 
   create_topology.tcl, create_traffic.tcl, and create_graph.tcl.  As 
   their file names indicate, create_topology.tcl implements the three 
   common network topologies discussed in Section 2.1, 
   create_traffic.tcl defines the traffic model parameters in the 
   simulation (see Section 2.2), and crate_graph.tcl generates 
   simulation statistics  (see Section 2.3) and plots graphs at the end 
   of simulations.  For the details on the graphs that can be generated, 
   please refer to the manual available at [21]. 

   Three example scripts are given in the package.  Let's take the dumb-
   bell topology as an example.  The simulation script is 
   test_dumb_bell.tcl, and its default parameters are set in 
   def_dumb_bell.tcl.  Those parameters can be changed as needed. 

   Totally, the parameter setting includes three parts: topology setting 
   traffic setting, and simulation statistics and graph setting.  The 
   topology setting defines the specific topology parameters.  For dumb-
   bell, it sets the bottleneck bandwidth, round trip time, propagation 
   delay, and packet error rate in the bottleneck link.  The traffic 
   setting defines the traffic parameters used in the simulation, such 
   as the number of FTP traffic, what high-speed TCP protocol employed 
   by FTP, using AQM or not, and how long the simulation runs.  Finally, 
   you choose the performance statistics to be generated (like 
   bottleneck utilization, packet loss rate, etc.), and what kinds of 
   figures will be displayed (e.g., queue length variation over time). 

   After running "ns test_dumb_bell.tcl", simulation statistics in text 
   format and graphs in encapsulated postscript format are stored in the 
   directory /tmp/expX, where X stands for the sequence number of the 
   simulation.  At the same time, all the simulation results can be 
   viewed through a portal file /tmp/expX/index.html. 

   The parking-lot and network simulations are similar to the dumb-bell 
   topology.
