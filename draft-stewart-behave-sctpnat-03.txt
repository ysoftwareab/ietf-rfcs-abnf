Abstract

   Stream Control Transmission Protocol [RFC4960] provides a reliable
   communications channel between two end-hosts in many ways similar to
   TCP [RFC0793].  With the widespread deployment of Network Address
   Translators (NAT), specialized code has been added to NAT for TCP
   that allows multiple hosts to reside behind a NAT and yet use only a
   single globally unique IPv4 address, even when two hosts (behind the
   NAT) choose the same port numbers for their connection.  This

   additional code is sometimes classified as Network Address and Port
   Translation or NAPT.  To date, specialized code for SCTP has NOT yet
   been added to most NAT's so that only pure NAT is available.  The end
   result of this is that only one SCTP capable host can be behind a

   This document describes an SCTP specific variant of NAT which
   provides similar features of NAPT in the single point traversal
   scenario described in [I-D.xie-behave-sctp-nat-cons].  Furthermore
   both algorithms are compared.

1.  Introduction

   Stream Control Transmission Protocol [RFC4960] provides a reliable
   communications channel between two end-hosts in many ways similar to
   TCP [RFC0793].  With the widespread deployment of Network Address
   Translators (NAT), specialized code has been added to NAT for TCP
   that allows multiple hosts to reside behind a NAT and yet use only a
   single globally unique IPv4 address, even when both hosts (behind the
   NAT) choose the same port numbers for their connection.  This
   additional code is sometimes classified as Network Address and Port
   Translation or NAPT.  To date, specialized code for SCTP has NOT yet
   been added to most NAT's so that only true NAT is available.  The end
   result of this is that only one SCTP capable host can be behind a
   NAT.

   This document proposes an SCTP specific variant NAT that provides the
   NAPT functionality without changing SCTP port numbers.  The authors
   feel it is possible and desirable to make these changes for a number
   of reasons.

   o  It is desirable for SCTP end-hosts on multiple platforms to be
      able to share a global IP address behind a NAT, much as TCP does
      today.

   o  If a NAT does not need to change any data within an SCTP packet it
      will reduce the processing burden of NAT'ing SCTP by NOT needing
      to execute the CRC32c checksum required by SCTP.

   o  Not having to touch the IP payload makes the processing of ICMP
      messages in NATs easier.


2.  Terminology

   For this discussion we will use several terms.  For clarity we will
   first define these terms.

   o  Global-Address - That address that a host behind a NAT is
      attempting to contact.

   o  Global-Port - The port number of the peer process at the Global-
      Address.

   o  Local-Address - The local address that is known to the host behind
      the NAT, aka a private address [RFC1918].

   o  Local-Port - The port number that is in use by the host holding
      the Local-Address.  Normally this is the port that will be

Internet-Draft      SCTP Network Address Translation       November 2007


      translated by the NAPT to a different port number.

   o  Nat-Global-Address - The global address assigned to the NAT box
      which it uses as a source address when sending packets towards the
      Global-Address.

   o  Natted-Port - The port number that the NAT is using to represent
      the Local-Port when send data packets toward the Global-Address
      and Global-Port.

   o  Local-Vtag - The Verification Tag that the host inside the natted
      address space has chosen for its communication.  The V-Tag is a
      unique 32 bit tag that must accompany any incoming SCTP packet for
      this association to the Local-Address.

   o  Remote-Vtag - The Verification Tag that the host holding the
      Global-Address has chosen for its communication.  The V-Tag is a
      unique 32 bit tag that must accompany any incoming SCTP packet for
      this association to the Global-Address.


3.  The SCTP specific variant of NAT

   In this section we assume that we have multiple SCTP capable hosts
   behind a NAT which has one Nat-Global address.  Furthermore we are
   considering only the single point traversal scenario described in
   [I-D.xie-behave-sctp-nat-cons].

   The modification of SCTP packets sent to the public Internet is easy.
   The source address of the packet has to be replaced with the Nat-
   Global-Address.  It may also be necessary to establish some state in
   the NAT box to handle incoming packets, which is discussed later.

   For SCTP packets coming from the public Internet the destination
   address of the packets has to be replaced with the Local-Address of
   the host the packet has to be delivered to.  The lookup of the Local-
   Address is based on the Global-VTag, Global-Port, Global-Address,
   Local-Vtag and the Local-Port.

   For the SCTP NAT processing the NAT box has to maintain a table of
   Global-VTag, Global-Port, Global-Address, Local-VTag, Local-Port and
   Local-Address.  An entry in that table is called a NAT state control
   block.

   The processing of outgoing SCTP packets containing an INIT-chunk is
   described in the following figure.

                  To(Global-Address:Global-Port)
                  INIT(Initiate-Tag)]------->

   It should be noted that normally no NAT control block will be
   created.  However it is possible that that there is already a NAT
   control block with the same Global-Port, Global-Address, Initiate-
   Tag, Local-VTag but different Local-Address.  In this case the INIT
   SHOULD be dropped and an ABORT MAY be sent back.

   The processing of outgoing SCTP packets containing no INIT-chunk is
   described in the following figure.

   The processing of incoming SCTP packets containing INIT-ACK chunks is
   described in the following figure.

4.  Handling of local port number collisions

   There is one drawback of the SCTP specific variant of NAT compared to
   a NAPT solution like the ones available for TCP.  Consider the case
   where two hosts in the Local-Address space want to setup an SCTP
   association with the same server running on the same host in the
   Internet.  This means that the Global-Port and the Global-Address are
   the same.  If they both chose the same Local-Port the server can not
   distinguish both associations based on the address and port numbers.
   For the server it looks like the association is being restarted.  To
   overcome this limitation the client sends a NAT_SUPPORTED parameter
   in the INIT-chunk which is defined as follows:

   0                   1                   2                   3
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |         Type = 0xC007         |          Length=4             |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   When the server receives this parameter it will also use the
   verification tag to look up the association.  However, this will make
   it impossible to restart such associations.


5.  Handling of local port number and verification tag collisions and
    lost state

   Consider the case where two hosts in the Local-Address space want to
   setup an SCTP association with the same server running on the same
   host in the Internet.  This means that the Global-Port and the
   Global-Address are the same.  If they both chose the same Local-Port
   and Local-VTag, the NAT box can not distinguish incoming packets



Stewart & Tuexen          Expires May 20, 2008                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft      SCTP Network Address Translation       November 2007


   anymore.  But this is very unlikely.  The Local-Vtags are chosen by
   random and if the Local-Ports are also chosen ephemeral an random
   this gives a 46 bit random number which has to match.  In the TCP
   like NAPT case the NAT box can control the 16 bit Natted Port.

   However, if this unlikely happens the NAT box SHOULD respond to the
   INIT chunk by sending an ABORT chunk with the M-bit set.  The source
   address of the ABORT chunk MUST be the destination address of the
   SCTP packet containing the INIT chunk.

   The ABORT chunk defined in [RFC4960] is therefore extended by using
   the following format:

   0                   1                   2                   3
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   Type = 6    | Reserved  |M|T|           Length              |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   \                                                               \
   /                   zero or more Error Causes                   /
   \                                                               \
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   In case the NAT box has to handle an SCTP packet for which it does
   not have the necessary state, it SHOULD send an SCTP packet with an
   ABORT chunk as descibed above.


6.  Discussion of the SCTP specific variant of NAT

   The advantages of using the SCTP specific variant of NAT is that the
   NAT engines do not have to modify the SCTP packet at all.  This is
   important because modifying the packets requires a recalculation of
   the checksum over the complete packet.  There is no way of just
   computing the different like it is possible for the IP, UDP and TCP
   checksum.  It should also be noted that the processing of ICMP
   packets is easier.


7.  IANA Considerations

   TBD


8.  Security considerations

   State maintenance within a NAT is always a subject of possible Denial
   Of Service attack.  This document recommends that at a minimum a NAT

   run a timer on any SCTP state so that old association state can be
   cleaned up.
