Abstract

   This document describes an extension to vCard to support Instant
   Messaging (IM) and Presence Protocol (PP) applications.  IM and PP
   are becoming increasingly common ways of communicating, and users
   want to save this contact information in their address books.  This
   draft allows a URI that is associated with IM or PP to be specified
   inside of a vCard.

Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor before publication)

   This work is being discussed on the imc-vcard@imc.org mailing list.


1.  Overview

   As more and more people use various instant messaging (IM) and
   presence protocol (PP) applications, it becomes important for them to
   be able to share this contact address information along with the rest
   of their contact information.  RFC 2425 [1] and RFC 2426 [2] define a
   standard format for this information, which is referred to as vCard.
   This document defines a new type in a vCard for representing instant
   IM and PP URIs.  It is very similar to existing types for
   representing email address and telephone contact information.

   The type entry to hold this new contact information is an IMPP type.
   The IMPP entry has a single URI that indicates the address of a
   service that provides IM, PP, or both.  Also defined are some
   parameters that give hints as to when certain URIs would be
   appropriate.  A given vCard can have multiple IMPP entries, but each
   entry can contain only one URI.  Each IMPP entry can contain multiple
   parameters.  Any combination of parameters is valid, although a
   parameter should occur at most once in a given IMPP entry.

   The type of URI indicates what protocols might be usable for
   accessing it, but this document does not define any of the types.
   For example a URI type of

      "sip"[5] indicates to use SIP/SIMPLE,
      "xmpp"[6] indicates to use XMPP,
      "irc"[4] indicates to use IRC,
      "ymsgr" indicates to use yahoo,
      "msn" might indicate to use Microsoft messenger,
      "aim" indicates to use AOL, and
      "im"[8] or "pres"[7] indicates to use a CPIM or CPP gateway.

   The normative definition of this new vCard type is given in
   Section 2, and an informational ABNF is provided in Section 3.


2.  IANA Considerations

   The required email to define this extension (as defined in RFC2425)
   was sent on October 29, 2004 to the ietf-mime-direct@imc.org mailing
   list with the subject "Registration of text/directory MIME type IMPP"
   (see
   <http://www.imc.org/ietf-mime-direct/mail-archive/msg00068.html>).

Internet-Draft                 IMPP vCard                      June 2006


   This specification updates the "text/directory MIME Types"
   subregistry in the "text/directory MIME Registrations" registry with
   the following information:

   Type name: IMPP

   Type purpose: To specify the URI for instant messaging and presence
   protocol communications with the object the vCard represents.

   Type encoding: 8bit

   Type value: A single URI.  The type of the URI indicates the protocol
   that can be used for this contact.

   Type special notes: The type can include the type parameter "TYPE" to
   specify an intended use for the URI.  The TYPE parameter values can
   include:

   o  An indication of the type of communication for which this URI is
      appropriate.  This can be a value of PERSONAL or BUSINESS.
   o  An indication of the location of a device associated with this
      URI.  Values can be HOME, WORK, or MOBILE.
   o  The value PREF indicates this is a preferred address and has the
      same semantics as the PREF value in a TEL type.

   Additional information can be found in _RFCAAAA_.

   Intended usage: COMMON

   _[Note to IANA: Please replace AAAA with the RFC number for this
   specification.]_


3.  Formal Grammar

   The following ABNF grammar [3] extends the grammar found in RFC 2425
   [1] and RFC 2426 [2].

Internet-Draft                 IMPP vCard                      June 2006


   ;For name="IMPP"
    param      = impp-param ; Only impp parameters are allowed

    value      = uri

    impp-param = "TYPE" "=" impp-type *("," impp-type)

    impp-type  = "PERSONAL" / "BUSINESS" / ; purpose of communications
                 "HOME" / "WORK" / "MOBILE" /
                 "PREF" /
                 iana-token / x-name;
                 ; Values are case insensitive


4.  Example


   BEGIN:vCard
   VERSION:3.0
   FN:Alice Doe
   IMPP;TYPE=personal,pref:im:alice@example.com
   END:vCard


5.  Security Considerations

   This does not introduce additional security issues beyond the current
   vCard specification.  It is worth noting that many people consider
   their presence information more sensitive than other address
   information.  Any system that stores or transfers vCards needs to
   carefully consider the privacy issues around this information.
