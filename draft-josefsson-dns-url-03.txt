Internet-Draft               DNS URI scheme                  August 2001


1. Introduction and Background

   DNS [1][2] is a widely deployed protocol used to, among other
   things, translate domain names into IP addresses.  More recent work
   has added support for storing cryptographic keys and certificates in
   DNS [6][7].  To be able to locate, for example, certificates via a
   network resource, URIs are often used.  This document describes a
   URI scheme to locate DNS information.  The DNS URI scheme described
   here can be used to reference any DNS data, not only certificates.  

   The following sections are modelled after the Registration Template
   in [8].

2. URI Scheme

   The name of the URI scheme defined in this document is "dns".

   A DNS URI designates a DNS resource record: By domain name, type and
   class and optionally server.  The DNS URI follows the generic syntax
   from RFC 2396 [5], and is described using ABNF [4] in section 3.

   A DNS URI is of the following general form.  This is intended to
   illustrate, not define, the scheme.

   dns:[//server/]domain[?type=TYPE;class=CLASS]

3. URI Scheme Syntax

   Strings are not case sensitive and free insertion of
   linear-white-space is not permitted.

   dnsurl       = "dns:" [ "//" hostport "/" ] hostname ["?" query]
                                ; See RFC 2396 for "hostport" and
                                ; "hostname" definitions

   query        = queryelement [";" query]

   queryelement = ( "CLASS=" classval ) | ( "TYPE=" typeval ) |
                  ( 1*alphanum "=" 1*alphanum )

   classval     = 1*digit / "IN" / "CH" / ...
                                ; Any standard DNS class expressed as
                                ; mnemonic or as decimal integer

   typeval      = 1*digit / "A" / "NS" / "MD" / ...
                                ; Any standard DNS type expressed as
                                ; mnemonic or as decimal integer

   The digit representation of types and classes SHOULD NOT be used

   when a defined mnemonic for the corresponding value is known.

   Unless specified, the "server" is assumed to be locally
   (pre-)configured, and "class" to be the Internet class ("IN"), and
   "type" to be the Address (A) type.

   To resolve a DNS URI using the DNS protocol [2] a query is formed by
   using the hostname, classval and typeval from the URI string (or the
   previously mentioned default values if either classval or typeval is
   missing from the string).  If hostport is given in the URI string,
   this server should receive the DNS query.

4. Character Encoding Considerations

   Since 8-bit characters are not permitted in URIs, they must be
   encoded as per the "URI Generic Syntax" RFC.  DNS domains has been
   historically restricted to a subset of the US ASCII alphabet, but
   recent work within the IETF IDN working group is likely to change
   this restriction.  Since this specification re-uses the "hostport"
   definition from the URI specification [5], a possible future update
   of the "hostport" definition within the URI specifications might be
   sufficient to adapt DNS URIs to IDNs.

5. Intended Usage

   Broad usage. 

6. Applications and/or Protocols Using This Scheme

   E.g. CNRP.

7. Interoperability Considerations

   The data referenced by this URI scheme might be transferred by
   protocols that aren't URI aware (such as the DNS protocol). This is
   not anticipated to have any serious interoperability impact though.

8. Security Considerations

   A DNS URI does not embed confidential information.  If it references
   domains in the Internet DNS environment, even the information
   referenced by the URI is public information.  If a DNS URI is used
   within an "internal" DNS environment, the same security
   considerations of the DNS environment apply to the use and handling
   of DNS URIs themselves as well as the data returned by looking up
   these URIs.

   If security related information is referenced by DNS URIs (such as
   certificates stored in DNS), care must be taken to prevent for

   man-in-the-middle attacks that maliciously replace the certificate. 
   Techniques such as Secure DNS may be used.

   This draft does not affect the security considerations related to
   DNS itself.

9. IANA Considerations

   The IANA is asked to register the DNS URI scheme using this document
   as the template in accordance with RFC 2717 [8].

10. Examples

   The following illustrate a DNS query for "www.example.org" for the
   Internet (IN) class and the Address (A) type:

   dns:www.example.org?class=IN;type=A

   The following illustrate a DNS query for "simon.example.org" for the
   CERT type in the Internet (IN) class:

   dns:simon.example.org?type=CERT

   The following illustrate a DNS query for "ftp.example.org" from the
   DNS server "internal-dns.example.org" server, in the Internet (IN)
   class and the address (A) type:

   dns://internal-dns.example.org/ftp.example.org?type=A
