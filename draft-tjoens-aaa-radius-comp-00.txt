   an official submission for an AAA protocol.


1.0 Introduction

   The AAA Working Group has completed a document  that  itemizes  their
   requirements  for Network Access Applications (NASREQ, Mobile IP, and
   ROAMOPS).  This document compares the current RADIUS protocol to  the
   Network Access AAA Evaluation Criteria, and illustrates where and how
   RADIUS can be improved to become unconditionally compliant  to  these
   requirements.

   The main point the authors want to make is that  the  Network  Access
   AAA  requirements  can  be  met  by  completing the definition of the
   RADIUS protocol, which ensures real backwards  compatibility  with  a
   huge  installed  base  (classic  network access AAA services) without
   requiring each  administrative  domain  to  deploy  RADIUS/non-RADIUS
   gateways,  and  without  requiring  the diverse platforms hosting AAA
   client or server applications to support an additional (even untried)
   transport layer protocol on top of IP.

1.1  Requirements language

   In  this  document,  the  key  words  "MAY",  "MUST,   "MUST    NOT",
   "optional", "recommended",  "SHOULD",  and  "SHOULD  NOT",  are to be
   interpreted as described in [1].

   Please note that the requirements specified in this document  are  to
   be  used  in  evaluating  AAA  protocol  submissions.   As  such, the
   requirements language refers to capabilities of these protocols;  the
   protocol  documents will specify whether these features are required,
   recommended, or optional.  For example,  requiring  that  a  protocol
   support  confidentiality  is NOT the same thing as requiring that all
   protocol traffic be encrypted.

   A protocol submission is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one  or
   more  of  the MUST or MUST NOT requirements for the capabilities that
   it implements.  A protocol submission that satisfies  all  the  MUST,
   MUST  NOT, SHOULD and SHOULD NOT requirements for its capabilities is
   said to be "unconditionally compliant"; one that  satisfies  all  the
   MUST  and  MUST NOT requirements but not all the SHOULD or SHOULD NOT
   requirements  for  its  protocols  is  said  to   be   "conditionally
   compliant."

2.0  Requirements Summary

   This section contains the same four sections  as  found  in  the  AAA
   Network  Access  requirements.  Each  section  contains a new column,

   named RADIUS. For each requirement, it is noted  whether  the  RADIUS
   protocol  meets  (T),  Partially  meets (P), or does not meet (F) the
   stated requirement. Furthermore, each  requirement  has  a  footnote,
   which contains additional justification.

Clarifications

   [a]  The RADIUS protocol supports the scalability requirements,  with
        the  exception  of  tens  of  thousands of simultaneous requests
        between two communicating devices, as only up  to  256  requests
        can  be  outstanding  at any given time. This restriction can be
        worked around, for example, by increasing the  number  of  tran-
        sport addresses (IP address + UDP port) on either of the commun-
        icating devices. There are existing implementations  using  this
        technique.  Other  implementations have extended the request-to-
        reply mapping using a RADIUS attribute  that  MUST  be  returned
        unmodified  by  the  server to the client, thereby extending the
        possible outstanding requests to 256 x 2^32 if both  client  and
        server support this extention.

   [b]  RADIUS allows for failover, failback and  retransmission  to  be
        implemented  on  clients,  by  providing  a means for clients to
        detect non-acknowledgement of requests and by providing a  means
        for  servers  to detect retransmission. Additionally, the RADIUS
        message set could easily be extended to  include  alive  checks,
        failover notification or server controlled failover and failback
        if required. Note that  implementations  exist  that  allow  for
        RADIUS  servers  to  send  requests to RADIUS clients on a well-
        known UDP port of the client.

   [c]  RADIUS  supports  authentication  of  server  to  client  during
        authentication  (using a request and response authenticator with
        shared secret), and supports mutual client-server authentication
        during   accounting  (again  using  authenticators  with  shared
        secret).  Stronger  mutual  authentication  between  client  and
        server can be accomplished for example by an underlying security
        service (like IPSec) or by support of the Message  Authenticator
        as defined in [7].

   [d]  RADIUS supports  hop-by-hop  authentication  and  integrity  for
        authentication  responses and accounting requests and responses.
        Hop-by-hop confidentiality is currently  provided  for  password
        attributes  in  authentication  requests and responses. The hop-
        by-hop integrity of authentication requests can be  provided  by
        including an integrity check vector attribute. Stronger security
        can be accomplished  by  an  underlying  security  service  like
        IPSec.

   [e]  RADIUS does not yet support end-to-end  confidentiality  at  the
        attribute  level.  It  is  however possible to extend the RADIUS
        protocol to allow data objects (attribute groups) to be encapsu-
        lated and encrypted for this purpose.

   [f]  RADIUS  does  not  yet  support  end-to-end  authentication  and
        integrity  at  the  attribute  level.  It is however possible to
        extend the RADIUS protocol  to  allow  data  objects  (attribute
        groups) to be encapsulated and marked with an end-to-end authen-
        ticated integrity check vector.

   [g]  RADIUS does not yet support  certificate  transport.   This  can
        however  be  provided by defining new messages and/or attributes
        for out-of-band and/or in-band certificate exchange.

   [h]  The RADIUS protocol uses UDP/IP for transport of messages.

        1.  Hop-by-hop retransmission and failover is  supported,  under
            control  of  the application (e.g. requires stateful proxies
            and tuned retransmission timers).

        2.  The retransmission mechanism is entirely controlled  by  the
            application, not the underlying transport.

        3.  For authentication requests,  receipt  is  not  acknowledged
            until  the  response  is  available.  For authentication and
            accounting responses, receipt is not acknowledged  (although
            some implementations use an Accounting-Request/Start message
            as acknowledgement  for  Access-Accept).  Accounting-Request
            messages  are  explicitly  acknowledged. Message independent
            acknowledgement can be provided in RADIUS by introducing  an
            explicit acknowledge message.

        4.  (item not listed in Evaluation Requirements)

        5.  Piggy-backing of acknowledgments  can  be  provided  in  the
            explicit acknowledge message to be defined. Piggy-backing on
            actual AAA messages would require windowing support which is
            difficult to introduce in RADIUS.

        6.  Timely delivery of responses is controlled by  the  applica-
            tion.

   [i]  RADIUS messages can be transported over IPv4.  The RADIUS proto-
        col  depends  on  the underlying IP version since certain attri-
        butes can have an 'address' data type which  is  defined  as  an
        IPv4 address. IPv4 is supported.

   [j]  RADIUS messages can be transported over IPv6.  The RADIUS proto-
        col  depends  on  the underlying IP version since certain attri-
        butes can have an 'address' data type which  is  defined  as  an
        IPv4  address.  An IPv6 address data type can be defined to sup-
        port IPv6 address values.

   [k]  RADIUS supports proxy and  transparent  brokers,  as  explicitly
        clarified in [5]. The RADIUS protocol does not by itself support
        a means for routing brokers to provide the  client  with  a  new
        server address. This can be accomplished by extending the RADIUS
        message set with  routing  messages  or  redirection  attributes
        within the existing message set.

   [l]  RADIUS does not yet support tracing of  the  end-to-end  message
        path  nor  the  changes made to attributes along that path. This
        information may be logged for off-line auditing purposes at each
        hop.

   [m]  The RADIUS protocol currently requires  shared  secrets  between
        communicating  devices  to match. In case an underlying security
        service (e.g. IPSec) is used, it is possible  to  configure  the
        communicating devices with empty shared secret values.

   [n]  The RADIUS protocol currently defines  attributes  and  messages
        for AAA services, out of a message and attribute number space of
        size 255 each. Within the common attribute number space, a  sin-
        gle attribute type is used to encapsulate Vendor-Specific attri-
        butes. The same mechanism can be used  to  encapsulate  standard
        attributes defined as extensions for other services.

Clarifications

   [a]  The RADIUS protocol defines a User-Name attribute for  authenti-
        cation  and  accounting,  supporting  the NAI format [5][13] and
        allowing for message forwarding based on e.g. realm  identifica-
        tion prefixes or suffixes.

   [b]  The RADIUS protocol supports authentication of a PPP user  using
        the  CHAP authentication mechanism by passing the CHAP challenge
        and challenge response in attributes to the home AAA server  for
        verification.

   [c]  The RADIUS protocol has been extended  in  [7]  to  support  PPP
        users  using the EAP authentication mechanism, supporting attri-
        butes to carry EAP messages.

   [d]  The RADIUS protocol supports authentication of a PPP user  using
        the  PAP  authentication  mechanism  as  well as terminal access
        users using clear-text passwords. The passwords are  transmitted
        in  a  confidential manner for hop-by-hop communication. End-to-
        end  confidentiality of password  attributes  is  not  yet  sup-
        ported.  It  is, however, possible to extend the RADIUS protocol
        to allow data objects (attribute groups) to be encapsulated  and
        encrypted for this purpose.

   [e]  The RADIUS protocol  supports  re-authentication.  In  case  re-
        authentication  is  initiated by the user or AAA client, the AAA
        client can send a new authentication request.  Re-authentication
        can  be initiated from the visited or home AAA server by sending
        a challenge message to the AAA client.

   [f]  The  RADIUS  protocol  does  not  yet  explicitly  support  non-
        authenticated  authorisation.  This  can  easily be supported by
        defining a new request message type or a new end-to-end  secured
        attribute.

Clarifications

   [a]  RADIUS allows for both static and dynamic  address  assignement.
        Currently  only  an  IPv4  address data type is defined. An IPv6
        address data type can be defined to support IPv6 address values.
        The  Address  field of the transported Framed-IP-Address or NAS-
        IP-Address attributes can be extended to 16 octets [5].

   [b]  This is always true when RADIUS is used as base protocol.  More-
        over, by completing RADIUS within the new scope of the AAA Work-
        ing Group, not only can backwards compatibility with  user  pro-
        file databases be guaranteed, it can also guarantee protocol and
        application  level  compatibility   for   the   installed   base
        RADIUS/AAA  applications.  Therefore this approach does not even
        require a gateway application.

   [c]  RADIUS supports proxy and transparent brokers [5]. RADIUS allows
        brokers  to  reject authentication requests before or after con-
        tacting the home AAA server. This behaviour  is  entirely  under
        control  of the application (e.g based on the requested Service-
        Type, or based on the authorisation attributes included  in  the
        response).

   [d]  [10] defines a set of RADIUS attributes designed to support  the
        provision  of  compulsory  tunneling  in  dial-up networks. [11]
        defines the necessary new RADIUS accounting Attributes  and  new
        values for the existing Acct-Status-Type Attribute.

   [e]  The RADIUS protocol has defined  the  Session-Timeout  attribute
        [5]  to  set the maximum number of seconds of service to be pro-
        vided to the user before termination of the session  or  prompt.
        In  order to renew a session, a re-authorization MUST be submit-
        ted.   Re-authorization   without   re-authentication   is   not
        currently supported in RADIUS, but can be provided by defining a
        new message type or attribute.  Active termination of a  session
        from  a  RADIUS server or broker is not currently supported, but
        existing implementations have proven that RADIUS can be extended

        to  support  this  as a Disconnect-Request from server to client
        [9].
   [f]

        [1][2][3]Time/day,port location and dialed/dialling number  res-
                 trictions  are  typically  applied  at  the AAA home or
                 broker servers.

        [4]  Concurrent login restriction is supported (per AAA  client)
             by  the  Port-Limit attribute. Global concurrent login res-
             triction can be implemented by stateful  brokers  and  home
             AAA servers.

        [5]  RADIUS provides for  a  Session-Timeout  attribute  to  aid
             enforcement  of  the time/day restriction and session dura-
             tion restriction on the AAA client. RADIUS also defines  an
             Idle-Timeout  attribute  to  force termination of idle ses-
             sions on the AAA client.

        [6]  RADIUS specifies the Filter-Id attribute [5],  which  indi-
             cates  the  name of the filter list for this user.  Zero or
             more Filter-Id attributes MAY be sent in  an  Access-Accept
             packet. Identifying a filter list by name allows the filter
             to be used on different NASes without regard to filter-list
             implementation  details. Existing implementations are known
             to use the Vendor-Specific attribute defined in  RADIUS  to
             implement  an  attribute that contains the filter rule in a
             vendor-specifc format.

        [7]  Static routes can be enforced via zero or  more  occurences
             of the RADIUS attribute Framed-Route.  Existing implementa-
             tions are known to support new attributes to enforce  other
             types  of  forced  access  paths  (e.g.  fixed  uplink PVC,
             bypassing the AAA client's routing function).

        [8]  QOS parameters are not currently defined in RADIUS, but can
             easily  be  provided  by  defining the corresponding attri-
             butes. Existing implementations are known  to  use  Vendor-
             Specific attributes to provide QoS (e.g. TOS bit masks, VPN
             IDs) parameters to the AAA client.

   [g]  The AAA network access requirements describe  State  Reconcilia-
        tion as requiring:

        [1]  Re-authorization capabilities - The  RADIUS  protocol  pro-
             vides  the  Session-Timeout  attribute [5], which indicates
             the number of seconds of service to be provided to the user
             before termination of the session or prompt. The AAA client

             may re-authorise in order to retrieve this value if lost on
             the   client.   However   RADIUS   currently   forces   re-
             authorisation to include re-authentication as well.

        [2]  Session disconnect message - RADIUS does not yet support  a
             session  disconnect message. This can, however, be provided
             by defining a Disconnect-Request message and  by  requiring
             the   Acct-Session-Id  attribute  to  be  included  in  all
             session-related  messages.  Examples  of  existing   RADIUS
             implementations using this technique are provided in [9].

        [3]  Transport and application-layer reliability - RADIUS relies
             on  UDP   for   the   delivery/transport   of   information
             between client  and  server,   the   protocol  handles  the
             loss  of request by implementing a time-out and retransmis-
             sion   strategy.   However,   the  protocol   specification
             failed  to  define  a  standard  retransmission and timeout
             scheme. It is in fact the application layer that takes care
             of   retransmission,   fail-over  and  timely  delivery  of
             responses. RADIUS does not take  care  of  acknowledgements
             and windowing. RADIUS can, however, be extended to optimise
             delivery  reliability  as  described  under   the   General
             Requirements section above.

        [4]  An interim message  -  RADIUS  allows  to  include  in  the
             Accounting  Request  the  "Interim-Update" value in a Acct-
             Status-Type attribute [6]. RADIUS provides the  possibility
             for a server that wishes to receive interim accounting mes-
             sages for the  given  user  to  include  the  Acct-Interim-
             Interval  RADIUS  attribute  in the authentication response
             message, which indicates the interval  in  seconds  between
             interim messages [7].

        [5]  A mechanism for the AAA server to retrieve  state  informa-
             tion  from  the  NAS.  This  mechanism  will provide timely
             information although a  complete  state  dump  may  not  be
             immediately  available.  - RADIUS as originally defined did
             not require AAA servers to keep state.  The  documents  [5]
             and  [6] include clarifications on using RADIUS with state-
             ful brokers or proxy servers. Existing  implementations  of
             RADIUS  brokers/proxies  are  capable of providing resource
             management (concurrent session limitation, port  wholesale,
             centralised  IP  pools,  ...).  Although  RADIUS allows for
             stateful implementations, it does  not  yet  support  state
             retrieval  between  AAA  client  and  AAA  server. Existing
             implemenations are known to support this today using exten-
             tions to RADIUS (new messages and attributes).

        [6]  A NAS reboot  message  -  RADIUS  supports  the  Accounting
             On/Off  messages  which  may  imply  an  AAA  client reboot
             (before and after). An extra attribute can  be  defined  to
             explicitly  state the reason for the Accounting On/Off mes-
             sages.

        [7]  Accounting  On/Off  messages  -  The  RADIUS  protocol  has
             defined  the  Accounting-Status-Type  attribute to indicate
             whether an Accounting-Request marks the  beginning  of  the
             user  service  (Start)  or  the end (Stop). [7] has defined
             additional values to support  the  Accounting  On/Off  mes-
             sages.

   [h]  Session disconnect message - RADIUS does not yet support a  ses-
        sion  disconnect  message.  This  can,  however,  be provided by
        defining  a  new  Disconnect-Request  message,  a  correspondant
        disconnect  reason  value  in the Acct-Terminate-Cause attribute
        [6], and the requirement to include the  Acct-Session-Id  attri-
        bute in all session-related messages.

Clarifications

   [a]  The RADIUS implementation, based on the extensions as defined in
        [7]  allows  for indicating an accounting interval time at which
        cumulative accounting information should be sent to the Account-
        ing Server.

   [b]  The present set of attributes defined in [6] and [7]  represents
        a  compact  representation  of  accounting  data. If it would be
        required to transport entire accounting records, RADIUS could be
        extended with an attribute along the ADIF definition [14].

   [c]  By  definition  of  new  attributes  for  accounting  data,  the
        accounting information transported can be easily extended. If it
        would be required to transport entire accounting records, RADIUS
        could  be  extended with an attribute along the ADIF definition,
        which allows for easy extension.

   [d]  RADIUS does not yet support batch accounting.  It  is,  however,
        possible  to  extend  the  attribute  space  of  RADIUS  with an
        accounting batch attribute.

   [e]  RADIUS prescribes every Accounting-Request message  to  be  ack-
        nowledged  by  an  Accounting-Response  message  indicating suc-
        cessfull delivery. A retransmission scheme allows  for  repeated
        attempts for delivery.

   [f]  The RADIUS  extensions  specification  [7]  defines  the  Event-
        Timestamp  Attribute  as  an extension to the Accounting-Request
        message.

   [g]  RADIUS does not yet support dynamic authorization. It  is,  how-
        ever,  possible to extend the message set of RADIUS (or semantic
        interpretation of the existing message set) to  include  dynamic
        (re-)authorization.   RADIUS   allows  for  interim  updates  of
        accounting information, as defined in [7].

        is, however, possible to extend the attribute space of RADIUS to

3.0  Conclusion

   The RADIUS protocol, and its associated extensions [7], is  presently
   not  fully  compliant  with  the AAA Network Access requirements [2].
   However, as is indicated at the relevant places in this  document  it
   is  possible with a small effort to extend present procedures to meet
   the requirements as listed in [2], while maintaining a high level  of
   interoperability  with  the  wide  deployment  and  installed base of
   RADIUS clients and servers.

   an official submission for an AAA protocol.


1.0 Introduction

   The AAA Working Group has completed a document  that  itemizes  their
   requirements  for Network Access Applications (NASREQ, Mobile IP, and
   ROAMOPS).  This document compares the current RADIUS protocol to  the
   Network Access AAA Evaluation Criteria, and illustrates where and how
   RADIUS can be improved to become unconditionally compliant  to  these
   requirements.

   The main point the authors want to make is that  the  Network  Access
   AAA  requirements  can  be  met  by  completing the definition of the
   RADIUS protocol, which ensures real backwards  compatibility  with  a
   huge  installed  base  (classic  network access AAA services) without
   requiring each  administrative  domain  to  deploy  RADIUS/non-RADIUS
   gateways,  and  without  requiring  the diverse platforms hosting AAA
   client or server applications to support an additional (even untried)
   transport layer protocol on top of IP.

1.1  Requirements language

   In  this  document,  the  key  words  "MAY",  "MUST,   "MUST    NOT",
   "optional", "recommended",  "SHOULD",  and  "SHOULD  NOT",  are to be
   interpreted as described in [1].

   Please note that the requirements specified in this document  are  to
   be  used  in  evaluating  AAA  protocol  submissions.   As  such, the
   requirements language refers to capabilities of these protocols;  the
   protocol  documents will specify whether these features are required,
   recommended, or optional.  For example,  requiring  that  a  protocol
   support  confidentiality  is NOT the same thing as requiring that all
   protocol traffic be encrypted.

   A protocol submission is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one  or
   more  of  the MUST or MUST NOT requirements for the capabilities that
   it implements.  A protocol submission that satisfies  all  the  MUST,
   MUST  NOT, SHOULD and SHOULD NOT requirements for its capabilities is
   said to be "unconditionally compliant"; one that  satisfies  all  the
   MUST  and  MUST NOT requirements but not all the SHOULD or SHOULD NOT
   requirements  for  its  protocols  is  said  to   be   "conditionally
   compliant."

2.0  Requirements Summary

   This section contains the same four sections  as  found  in  the  AAA
   Network  Access  requirements.  Each  section  contains a new column,

   named RADIUS. For each requirement, it is noted  whether  the  RADIUS
   protocol  meets  (T),  Partially  meets (P), or does not meet (F) the
   stated requirement. Furthermore, each  requirement  has  a  footnote,
   which contains additional justification.

Clarifications

   [a]  The RADIUS protocol supports the scalability requirements,  with
        the  exception  of  tens  of  thousands of simultaneous requests
        between two communicating devices, as only up  to  256  requests
        can  be  outstanding  at any given time. This restriction can be
        worked around, for example, by increasing the  number  of  tran-
        sport addresses (IP address + UDP port) on either of the commun-
        icating devices. There are existing implementations  using  this
        technique.  Other  implementations have extended the request-to-
        reply mapping using a RADIUS attribute  that  MUST  be  returned
        unmodified  by  the  server to the client, thereby extending the
        possible outstanding requests to 256 x 2^32 if both  client  and
        server support this extention.

   [b]  RADIUS allows for failover, failback and  retransmission  to  be
        implemented  on  clients,  by  providing  a means for clients to
        detect non-acknowledgement of requests and by providing a  means
        for  servers  to detect retransmission. Additionally, the RADIUS
        message set could easily be extended to  include  alive  checks,
        failover notification or server controlled failover and failback
        if required. Note that  implementations  exist  that  allow  for
        RADIUS  servers  to  send  requests to RADIUS clients on a well-
        known UDP port of the client.

   [c]  RADIUS  supports  authentication  of  server  to  client  during
        authentication  (using a request and response authenticator with
        shared secret), and supports mutual client-server authentication
        during   accounting  (again  using  authenticators  with  shared
        secret).  Stronger  mutual  authentication  between  client  and
        server can be accomplished for example by an underlying security
        service (like IPSec) or by support of the Message  Authenticator
        as defined in [7].

   [d]  RADIUS supports  hop-by-hop  authentication  and  integrity  for
        authentication  responses and accounting requests and responses.
        Hop-by-hop confidentiality is currently  provided  for  password
        attributes  in  authentication  requests and responses. The hop-
        by-hop integrity of authentication requests can be  provided  by
        including an integrity check vector attribute. Stronger security
        can be accomplished  by  an  underlying  security  service  like
        IPSec.

   [e]  RADIUS does not yet support end-to-end  confidentiality  at  the
        attribute  level.  It  is  however possible to extend the RADIUS
        protocol to allow data objects (attribute groups) to be encapsu-
        lated and encrypted for this purpose.

   [f]  RADIUS  does  not  yet  support  end-to-end  authentication  and
        integrity  at  the  attribute  level.  It is however possible to
        extend the RADIUS protocol  to  allow  data  objects  (attribute
        groups) to be encapsulated and marked with an end-to-end authen-
        ticated integrity check vector.

   [g]  RADIUS does not yet support  certificate  transport.   This  can
        however  be  provided by defining new messages and/or attributes
        for out-of-band and/or in-band certificate exchange.

   [h]  The RADIUS protocol uses UDP/IP for transport of messages.

        1.  Hop-by-hop retransmission and failover is  supported,  under
            control  of  the application (e.g. requires stateful proxies
            and tuned retransmission timers).

        2.  The retransmission mechanism is entirely controlled  by  the
            application, not the underlying transport.

        3.  For authentication requests,  receipt  is  not  acknowledged
            until  the  response  is  available.  For authentication and
            accounting responses, receipt is not acknowledged  (although
            some implementations use an Accounting-Request/Start message
            as acknowledgement  for  Access-Accept).  Accounting-Request
            messages  are  explicitly  acknowledged. Message independent
            acknowledgement can be provided in RADIUS by introducing  an
            explicit acknowledge message.

        4.  (item not listed in Evaluation Requirements)

        5.  Piggy-backing of acknowledgments  can  be  provided  in  the
            explicit acknowledge message to be defined. Piggy-backing on
            actual AAA messages would require windowing support which is
            difficult to introduce in RADIUS.

        6.  Timely delivery of responses is controlled by  the  applica-
            tion.

   [i]  RADIUS messages can be transported over IPv4.  The RADIUS proto-
        col  depends  on  the underlying IP version since certain attri-
        butes can have an 'address' data type which  is  defined  as  an
        IPv4 address. IPv4 is supported.

   [j]  RADIUS messages can be transported over IPv6.  The RADIUS proto-
        col  depends  on  the underlying IP version since certain attri-
        butes can have an 'address' data type which  is  defined  as  an
        IPv4  address.  An IPv6 address data type can be defined to sup-
        port IPv6 address values.

   [k]  RADIUS supports proxy and  transparent  brokers,  as  explicitly
        clarified in [5]. The RADIUS protocol does not by itself support
        a means for routing brokers to provide the  client  with  a  new
        server address. This can be accomplished by extending the RADIUS
        message set with  routing  messages  or  redirection  attributes
        within the existing message set.

   [l]  RADIUS does not yet support tracing of  the  end-to-end  message
        path  nor  the  changes made to attributes along that path. This
        information may be logged for off-line auditing purposes at each
        hop.

   [m]  The RADIUS protocol currently requires  shared  secrets  between
        communicating  devices  to match. In case an underlying security
        service (e.g. IPSec) is used, it is possible  to  configure  the
        communicating devices with empty shared secret values.

   [n]  The RADIUS protocol currently defines  attributes  and  messages
        for AAA services, out of a message and attribute number space of
        size 255 each. Within the common attribute number space, a  sin-
        gle attribute type is used to encapsulate Vendor-Specific attri-
        butes. The same mechanism can be used  to  encapsulate  standard
        attributes defined as extensions for other services.

Clarifications

   [a]  The RADIUS protocol defines a User-Name attribute for  authenti-
        cation  and  accounting,  supporting  the NAI format [5][13] and
        allowing for message forwarding based on e.g. realm  identifica-
        tion prefixes or suffixes.

   [b]  The RADIUS protocol supports authentication of a PPP user  using
        the  CHAP authentication mechanism by passing the CHAP challenge
        and challenge response in attributes to the home AAA server  for
        verification.

   [c]  The RADIUS protocol has been extended  in  [7]  to  support  PPP
        users  using the EAP authentication mechanism, supporting attri-
        butes to carry EAP messages.

   [d]  The RADIUS protocol supports authentication of a PPP user  using
        the  PAP  authentication  mechanism  as  well as terminal access
        users using clear-text passwords. The passwords are  transmitted
        in  a  confidential manner for hop-by-hop communication. End-to-
        end  confidentiality of password  attributes  is  not  yet  sup-
        ported.  It  is, however, possible to extend the RADIUS protocol
        to allow data objects (attribute groups) to be encapsulated  and
        encrypted for this purpose.

   [e]  The RADIUS protocol  supports  re-authentication.  In  case  re-
        authentication  is  initiated by the user or AAA client, the AAA
        client can send a new authentication request.  Re-authentication
        can  be initiated from the visited or home AAA server by sending
        a challenge message to the AAA client.

   [f]  The  RADIUS  protocol  does  not  yet  explicitly  support  non-
        authenticated  authorisation.  This  can  easily be supported by
        defining a new request message type or a new end-to-end  secured
        attribute.

Clarifications

   [a]  RADIUS allows for both static and dynamic  address  assignement.
        Currently  only  an  IPv4  address data type is defined. An IPv6
        address data type can be defined to support IPv6 address values.
        The  Address  field of the transported Framed-IP-Address or NAS-
        IP-Address attributes can be extended to 16 octets [5].

   [b]  This is always true when RADIUS is used as base protocol.  More-
        over, by completing RADIUS within the new scope of the AAA Work-
        ing Group, not only can backwards compatibility with  user  pro-
        file databases be guaranteed, it can also guarantee protocol and
        application  level  compatibility   for   the   installed   base
        RADIUS/AAA  applications.  Therefore this approach does not even
        require a gateway application.

   [c]  RADIUS supports proxy and transparent brokers [5]. RADIUS allows
        brokers  to  reject authentication requests before or after con-
        tacting the home AAA server. This behaviour  is  entirely  under
        control  of the application (e.g based on the requested Service-
        Type, or based on the authorisation attributes included  in  the
        response).

   [d]  [10] defines a set of RADIUS attributes designed to support  the
        provision  of  compulsory  tunneling  in  dial-up networks. [11]
        defines the necessary new RADIUS accounting Attributes  and  new
        values for the existing Acct-Status-Type Attribute.

   [e]  The RADIUS protocol has defined  the  Session-Timeout  attribute
        [5]  to  set the maximum number of seconds of service to be pro-
        vided to the user before termination of the session  or  prompt.
        In  order to renew a session, a re-authorization MUST be submit-
        ted.   Re-authorization   without   re-authentication   is   not
        currently supported in RADIUS, but can be provided by defining a
        new message type or attribute.  Active termination of a  session
        from  a  RADIUS server or broker is not currently supported, but
        existing implementations have proven that RADIUS can be extended

        to  support  this  as a Disconnect-Request from server to client
        [9].
   [f]

        [1][2][3]Time/day,port location and dialed/dialling number  res-
                 trictions  are  typically  applied  at  the AAA home or
                 broker servers.

        [4]  Concurrent login restriction is supported (per AAA  client)
             by  the  Port-Limit attribute. Global concurrent login res-
             triction can be implemented by stateful  brokers  and  home
             AAA servers.

        [5]  RADIUS provides for  a  Session-Timeout  attribute  to  aid
             enforcement  of  the time/day restriction and session dura-
             tion restriction on the AAA client. RADIUS also defines  an
             Idle-Timeout  attribute  to  force termination of idle ses-
             sions on the AAA client.

        [6]  RADIUS specifies the Filter-Id attribute [5],  which  indi-
             cates  the  name of the filter list for this user.  Zero or
             more Filter-Id attributes MAY be sent in  an  Access-Accept
             packet. Identifying a filter list by name allows the filter
             to be used on different NASes without regard to filter-list
             implementation  details. Existing implementations are known
             to use the Vendor-Specific attribute defined in  RADIUS  to
             implement  an  attribute that contains the filter rule in a
             vendor-specifc format.

        [7]  Static routes can be enforced via zero or  more  occurences
             of the RADIUS attribute Framed-Route.  Existing implementa-
             tions are known to support new attributes to enforce  other
             types  of  forced  access  paths  (e.g.  fixed  uplink PVC,
             bypassing the AAA client's routing function).

        [8]  QOS parameters are not currently defined in RADIUS, but can
             easily  be  provided  by  defining the corresponding attri-
             butes. Existing implementations are known  to  use  Vendor-
             Specific attributes to provide QoS (e.g. TOS bit masks, VPN
             IDs) parameters to the AAA client.

   [g]  The AAA network access requirements describe  State  Reconcilia-
        tion as requiring:

        [1]  Re-authorization capabilities - The  RADIUS  protocol  pro-
             vides  the  Session-Timeout  attribute [5], which indicates
             the number of seconds of service to be provided to the user
             before termination of the session or prompt. The AAA client

             may re-authorise in order to retrieve this value if lost on
             the   client.   However   RADIUS   currently   forces   re-
             authorisation to include re-authentication as well.

        [2]  Session disconnect message - RADIUS does not yet support  a
             session  disconnect message. This can, however, be provided
             by defining a Disconnect-Request message and  by  requiring
             the   Acct-Session-Id  attribute  to  be  included  in  all
             session-related  messages.  Examples  of  existing   RADIUS
             implementations using this technique are provided in [9].

        [3]  Transport and application-layer reliability - RADIUS relies
             on  UDP   for   the   delivery/transport   of   information
             between client  and  server,   the   protocol  handles  the
             loss  of request by implementing a time-out and retransmis-
             sion   strategy.   However,   the  protocol   specification
             failed  to  define  a  standard  retransmission and timeout
             scheme. It is in fact the application layer that takes care
             of   retransmission,   fail-over  and  timely  delivery  of
             responses. RADIUS does not take  care  of  acknowledgements
             and windowing. RADIUS can, however, be extended to optimise
             delivery  reliability  as  described  under   the   General
             Requirements section above.

        [4]  An interim message  -  RADIUS  allows  to  include  in  the
             Accounting  Request  the  "Interim-Update" value in a Acct-
             Status-Type attribute [6]. RADIUS provides the  possibility
             for a server that wishes to receive interim accounting mes-
             sages for the  given  user  to  include  the  Acct-Interim-
             Interval  RADIUS  attribute  in the authentication response
             message, which indicates the interval  in  seconds  between
             interim messages [7].

        [5]  A mechanism for the AAA server to retrieve  state  informa-
             tion  from  the  NAS.  This  mechanism  will provide timely
             information although a  complete  state  dump  may  not  be
             immediately  available.  - RADIUS as originally defined did
             not require AAA servers to keep state.  The  documents  [5]
             and  [6] include clarifications on using RADIUS with state-
             ful brokers or proxy servers. Existing  implementations  of
             RADIUS  brokers/proxies  are  capable of providing resource
             management (concurrent session limitation, port  wholesale,
             centralised  IP  pools,  ...).  Although  RADIUS allows for
             stateful implementations, it does  not  yet  support  state
             retrieval  between  AAA  client  and  AAA  server. Existing
             implemenations are known to support this today using exten-
             tions to RADIUS (new messages and attributes).

        [6]  A NAS reboot  message  -  RADIUS  supports  the  Accounting
             On/Off  messages  which  may  imply  an  AAA  client reboot
             (before and after). An extra attribute can  be  defined  to
             explicitly  state the reason for the Accounting On/Off mes-
             sages.

        [7]  Accounting  On/Off  messages  -  The  RADIUS  protocol  has
             defined  the  Accounting-Status-Type  attribute to indicate
             whether an Accounting-Request marks the  beginning  of  the
             user  service  (Start)  or  the end (Stop). [7] has defined
             additional values to support  the  Accounting  On/Off  mes-
             sages.

   [h]  Session disconnect message - RADIUS does not yet support a  ses-
        sion  disconnect  message.  This  can,  however,  be provided by
        defining  a  new  Disconnect-Request  message,  a  correspondant
        disconnect  reason  value  in the Acct-Terminate-Cause attribute
        [6], and the requirement to include the  Acct-Session-Id  attri-
        bute in all session-related messages.

Clarifications

   [a]  The RADIUS implementation, based on the extensions as defined in
        [7]  allows  for indicating an accounting interval time at which
        cumulative accounting information should be sent to the Account-
        ing Server.

   [b]  The present set of attributes defined in [6] and [7]  represents
        a  compact  representation  of  accounting  data. If it would be
        required to transport entire accounting records, RADIUS could be
        extended with an attribute along the ADIF definition [14].

   [c]  By  definition  of  new  attributes  for  accounting  data,  the
        accounting information transported can be easily extended. If it
        would be required to transport entire accounting records, RADIUS
        could  be  extended with an attribute along the ADIF definition,
        which allows for easy extension.

   [d]  RADIUS does not yet support batch accounting.  It  is,  however,
        possible  to  extend  the  attribute  space  of  RADIUS  with an
        accounting batch attribute.

   [e]  RADIUS prescribes every Accounting-Request message  to  be  ack-
        nowledged  by  an  Accounting-Response  message  indicating suc-
        cessfull delivery. A retransmission scheme allows  for  repeated
        attempts for delivery.

   [f]  The RADIUS  extensions  specification  [7]  defines  the  Event-
        Timestamp  Attribute  as  an extension to the Accounting-Request
        message.

   [g]  RADIUS does not yet support dynamic authorization. It  is,  how-
        ever,  possible to extend the message set of RADIUS (or semantic
        interpretation of the existing message set) to  include  dynamic
        (re-)authorization.   RADIUS   allows  for  interim  updates  of
        accounting information, as defined in [7].

Clarifications

   [a]  RADIUS does not yet support Mobile IP registration messages.  It
        is, however, possible to extend the attribute space of RADIUS to
        include the registration information.

   [b]  RADIUS  is  known  to  be  operational  in  environments   where
        firewalls acting as a proxy are active.

   [c]  RADIUS does not yet support allocation of local Home agents.  It
        is, however, possible to extend the attribute space of RADIUS to

        allocate the local home agent.

3.0  Conclusion

   The RADIUS protocol, and its associated extensions [7], is  presently
   not  fully  compliant  with  the AAA Network Access requirements [2].
   However, as is indicated at the relevant places in this  document  it
   is  possible with a small effort to extend present procedures to meet
   the requirements as listed in [2], while maintaining a high level  of
   interoperability  with  the  wide  deployment  and  installed base of
   RADIUS clients and servers.
