3.  Open Source Implementations

3.1.  EMC/RSA RID Agent

   The EMC/RSA RID agent is an open source implementation of the
   Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standards for the exchange of
   incident and indicator data.  The code has been released under an MIT
   license and development will continue with the open source community
   at the Github site for RSA Intelligence Sharing:

      https://github.com/RSAIntelShare/RID-Server.git

   The code implements the RFC6545, Real-time Inter-network Defense
   (RID) and RFC6546, Transport of RID over HTTP/TLS protocol.  The code
   supports the evolving RFC5070-bis Incident Object Description
   Exchange Format (IODEF) data model from the work in the IETF working
   group Managed Incident Lightweight Exchange (MILE).

3.2.  NICT IODEF-SCI implementation

   Japan's National Institute of Information and Communications
   Technology (NICT) Network Security Research Institute implemented
   open source tools for exchanging, accumulating, and locating IODEF-
   SCI documents.

   Three tools are available in GitHub.  They assist the exchange of
   IODEF-SCI documents between parties.  IODEF-SCI is the IETF draft
   that extends IODEF so that IODEF document can embed structured
   cybersecurity information (SCI).  For instance, it can embed MMDEF,
   CEE, MAEC in XML and CVE identifiers.

   The three tools are generator, exchanger, and parser.  The generator
   generates IODEF-SCI document or appends an XML to existing IODEF
   document.  The exchanger sends the IODEF document to its
   correspondent node.  The parser receives, parses, and stores the
   IODEF-SCI document.  It also equips the interface that enable users
   to locate IODEF-SCI documents it has ever received.  The code has
   been released under an MIT license and development will continue
   here.

   Note that users can enjoy this software with their own
   responsibility.

4.  Vendor Implementations

4.1.  Deep Secure

   Deep-Secure Guards are built to protect a trusted domain from:

   o  releasing sensitive data that does not meet the organisational
      security policy

   o  applications receiving badly constructed or malicious data which
      could exploit a vulnerability (known or unknown)

   Deep-Secure Guards support HTTPS and XMPP (optimised server to server
   protocol) transports.  The Deep-Secure Guards support transfer of XML
   based business content by creating a schema to translate the known
   good content to and from the intermediate format.  This means that
   the Deep-Secure Guards can be used to protect:

   o  IODEF/RID using the HTTPS transport binding (RFC 6546)

   o  IODEF/RID using an XMPP binding

   o  ROLIE using HTTPS transport binding (draft-field-mile-rolie-02)

   o  STIX/TAXII using the HTTPS transport binding

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                  July 2014


   Deep-Secure Guards also support the SMTP transport and perform deep
   content inspection of content including XML attachments.  The Mail
   Guard supports S/MIME and Deep Secure are working on support for the
   upcoming PLASMA standard which enables information centric policy
   enforcement of data.

4.2.  IncMan Suite, DFLabs

   The Incident Object Description Exchange Format, documented in the
   RFC 5070, defines a data representation that provides a framework for
   sharing information commonly exchanged by Computer Security Incident
   Response Teams (CSIRTs) about computer security incidents.  IncMan
   Suite implements the IODEF standard for exchanging details about
   incidents, either for exporting and importing activities.  This has
   been introduced to enhance the capabilities of the various CSIRT, to
   facilitate collaboration and sharing of useful experiences, conveying
   awareness on specific cases.

   The IODEF implementation is specified as an XML schema, therefore all
   data are stored in an xml file: in this file all data of an incident
   are organized in a hierarchical structure to describe the various
   objects and their relationships.

   IncMan Suite relies on IODEF as a transport format, composed by
   various classes for describing the entities which are part of the
   incident description: for instance the various relevant timestamps
   (detect time , start time, end time, report time), the techniques
   used by the intruders to perpetrate the incident, the impact of the
   incident, either technical and non-technical (time and monetary) and
   obviously all systems involved in the incident.

4.2.1.  Exporting Incidents

   Each incident defined in IncMan Suite can be exported via a User
   Interface feature and it will populate an xml document.  Due to the
   nature of the data processed, the IODEF extraction might be
   considered privacy sensitive by the parties exchanging the
   information or by those described by it.  For this reason, specific
   care needs to be taken in ensuring the distribution to an appropriate
   audience or third party, either during the document exchange and
   subsequent processing.

   The xml document generated will include description and details of
   the incident along with all the systems involved and the related
   information.  At this stage it can be distributed for import into a
   remote system.

4.2.2.  Importing Incidents

   IncMan Suite provides a functionality to import incidents stored in
   files and transported via IODEF-compliant xml documents.  The
   importing process comprises of two steps: firstly, the file is
   inspected to validate if well formed, then all data are uploaded
   inside the system.

   If an incident is already existing in the system with the same
   incident id, the new one being imported will be created under a new
   id.  This approach prevents from accidentally overwriting existing
   info or merging inconsistent data.

   IncMan Suite includes also a feature to upload incidents from emails.

   The incident, described in xml format, can be stored directly into
   the body of the email message or transported as an attachment of the
   email.  At regular intervals, customizable by the user, IncMan Suite
   monitors for incoming emails, filtered by a configurable white-list
   and black-list mechanism on the sender's email account, then a parser
   processes the received email and a new incident is created
   automatically, after having validated the email body or the
   attachment to ensure it is a well formed format.

4.3.  Surevine Proof of Concept

   XMPP is enhanced and extended through the XMPP Extension Protocols
   (or XEPs).  XEP-0268 (http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0268.html)
   describes incident management (using IODEF) of the XMPP network
   itself, effectively supporting self-healing the XMPP network.  In
   order to more generically cover incident management of a network and
   over a network, XEP-0268 requires some updates.  We are working on
   these changes together with a new XEP that supports "social
   networking" over XMPP, enhancing the publish-and-subscribe XEP (XEP-
   0060).  This now allows nodes to publish any type of content and
   subscribe to and therefore receive the content.  XEP-0268 will be
   used to describe IODEF content.  We now have an alpha version of the
   server-side software and client-side software required to demonstrate
   the "social networking" capability and are currently enhancing this
   to support Cyber Incident management in real-time.

4.4.  MANTIS Cyber-Intelligence Management Framework

   MANTIS provides an example implementation of a framework for managing
   cyber threat intelligence expressed in standards such as STIX, CybOX,
   IODEF, etc.  The aims of providing such an example implementation
   are:

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                  July 2014


   o  To aide discussions about emerging standards such as STIX, CybOX
      et al. with respect to questions regarding tooling: how would a
      certain aspect be implemented, how do changes affect an
      implementation?  Such discussions become much easier and have a
      better basis if they can be lead in the context of example tooling
      that is known to the community.

   o  To lower the entrance barrier for organizations and teams (esp.
      CERT teams) in using emerging standards for cyber-threat
      intelligence management and exchange.

   o  To provide a platform on the basis of which research and
      community-driven development in the area of cyber-threat
      intelligence management can occur.

5.  Vendors with Planned Support

5.1.  Threat Central, HP

   HP has developed HP Threat Central, a security intelligence platform
   that enables automated, real-time collaboration between organizations
   to combat today's increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks.  One way
   automated sharing of threat indicators is achieved is through close
   integration with the HP ArcSight SIEM for automated upload and
   consumption of information from the Threat Central Server.  In
   addition HP Threat Central supports open standards for sharing threat
   information so that participants who do not use HP Security Products
   can participate in the sharing ecosystem.  General availability of
   Threat Central will be in 2014.  It is planned that future versions
   also support IODEF for the automated upload and download of threat
   information.

6.  Implementation Guide

   The section aims at sharing the tips for development of IODEF-capable
   systems.

6.1.  Code Generators

   For implementing IODEF-capable systems, it is feasible to employ code
   generators for XML Schema Document (XSD).  The generators are used to
   save development costs since they automatically create useful
   libraries for accessing XML attributes, composing messages, and/or
   validating XML objects.  The IODEF XSD was defined in section 8 of
   RFC 5070, and is availabe at http://www.iana.org/assignments/xml-
   registry/schema/iodef-1.0.xsd.

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                  July 2014


   However, there still remains some problem.  Due to the complexity of
   IODEF XSD, some code generators could not generate from the XSD file.
   The tested code generators were as follows.

   o  XML::Pastor [XSD:Perl] (Perl)

   o  RXSD [XSD:Ruby] (Ruby)

   o  PyXB [XSD:Python] (Python)

   o  JAXB [XSD:Java] (Java)

   o  CodeSynthesis XSD [XSD:Cxx] (C++)

   o  Xsd.exe [XSD:CS] (C#)

   For instance, we have used XML::Pastor, but it could not properly
   understand its schema due to the complexity of IODEF XSD.  The same
   applies to RXSD and JAXB.  Only PyXB, CodeSynthesis XSD and Xsd.exe
   were able to understand the schema.

   There is no recommended workaround, however, a double conversion of
   XSD file is one option to go through the situation; it means XSD is
   serialized to XML, and it is again converted to XSD.  The resultant
   XSD was process-able by the all tools above.

   It should be noted that IODEF uses '-' (hyphen) symbols in its
   classes or attributes, listed as follows.

   o  IODEF-Document Class; it is the top level class in the IODEF data
      model described in section 3.1 of [RFC5070].

   o  The vlan-name and vlan-num Attribute; according to section 3.16.2
      of [RFC5070], they are the name and number of Virtual LAN and are
      the attributes for Address class.

   o  Extending the Enumerated Values of Attribute; according to section
      5.1 of [RFC5070], it is a extension techniques to add new
      enumerated values to an attribute, and has a prefix of "ext-",
      e.g., ext-value, ext-category, ext-type, and so on.

   According to the language specification, many programing language
   prohibit to contain '-' symbols in the name of class.  The code
   generators must replace or remove '-' when building the librarlies.
   They should have the name space to restore '-' when outputting the
   XML along with IODEF XSD.

6.2.  Usability

   Here notes some tips to avoid problems.

   o  IODEF has category attribute for NodeRole class.  Though various
      categories are described, they are not enough.  For example, in
      the case of web mail servers, you should choose either "www" or
      "mail".  One suggestion is selecting "mail" as the category
      attribute and adding "www" for another attirbute.

   o  The numbering of Incident ID needs to be considered.  Otherwise,
      information, such as the number of incidents within certain period
      could be observed by document receivers.  For instance, we could
      randomize the assignment of the numbers.
