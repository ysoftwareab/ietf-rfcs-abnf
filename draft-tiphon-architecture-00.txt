1. Abstract

   The contents of this Internet Draft is a reprint of the body of the
   architecture document (DTS 02003 v0.10.8) of the TIPHON project.
   This document describes a functional architecture for the purposes
   of defining a voice over IP architecture that can interwork with the
   existing Switched Circuit Networks (SCN).
   The full document is publicly available and can be found at
   http://docbox.etsi.org/Tech-Org/TIPHON/Document/tiphon/07-
   drafts/wg2/DTS02003/ the current version is 0.10.8. Later versions
   will appear in the same directory. This full document describes
   protocol independent information flows and state diagrams on all the
   reference points.

   The next step in the TIPHON process will be the mapping of the
   reference points as defined in this document to existing standards.
   Since TIPHON does not intend to duplicate work so the project would
   appreciate assistance from IETF experts in the mapping of its
   information flows to the appropriate IETF protocols. Candidate
   protocols for the implementation of this architecture are SIP,
   MEGACOp and possibly others.

3. Scope
   The present document defines the network architecture and the
   reference configurations that are necessary for:
    - the delivery of telephone calls which originate in an Internet
   Protocol (IP) network and are delivered to Switched Circuit Networks
   (SCN);
    - the delivery of telephone calls which originate in SCNs and are
   delivered in an IP network;
    - the delivery of telephone calls which originate in SCNs, routed
   through a IP network and finally delivered to an SCN; and
    - the delivery of telephone calls which originate and terminate in
   IP networks. Such calls may be routed using an SCN.
   These four scenarios are part of TIPHON Release 3.
   The architecture includes provision of information and facilities
   which are incidental to the delivery of telephone calls described
   above.
   The present document builds upon the concepts embodied in the TIPHON
   Phase II Network Architecture and Reference Configurations [5] by
   considering the additional scenarios and the expansion of the IP
   network into a more appropriate network model.

   The present document is applicable to equipment performing the roles
   of terminal, and Gateway, and also to entities within the IP network
   that are necessary to support the four scenarios of TIPHON Release
   3. Where the text indicates the status of a requirement (i.e. as
   strict command or prohibition, as authorisations leaving freedom, or
   as a capability or possibility), this may modify the nature of a
   requirement within a referenced standard used to provide the
   capability.

4. Introduction
   The network architecture and reference configurations contained in
   the present document are derived from examination of the
   capabilities required by [6] for the support of TIPHON Scenarios 0,
   1, 2, 3 and 4 as identified in [4].
   The present document demonstrates how the scenarios given in [4],
   may be expressed as a set of interconnected networks with associated
   Interconnecting Functions. From this model, the concepts of
   functional planes, Functional Groupings, and functional layers are
   developed.
   Where there is a requirement that an information flow needs to be
   exchanged between physical equipment, a reference point is defined.
   Where an information flow will only be internal to pieces of
   physical equipment, no reference point is defined.

5. Networks
   TIPHON Scenarios 1, 2, 3 and 4 require interconnection of IP
   Telephony Networks (IPTN) and Switched Circuit Networks (SCN). For
   the purpose of the model, functionality can be distributed across a
   number of networks.
   Each network is part of only one administrative domain. When
   different administrative domains provide all functions needed to
   e.g. originate a call, these functions pertain to different
   networks. Each administrative domain may have its own policies on
   addressing, Quality of Service (QoS), etc.
   Each network may further be decomposed into functional groups, as
   shown in Clause 7.

5.1 Networks involved in registration
   Figure 1 shows the network types that may inter-operate during the
   registration of a user.

   The Home IPTN is the principle place where the user information is
   stored. The Home IPTN provides the functions required for
   registration and for subscriber related operations.
   The Serving IPTN provides the function required to register the user
   and to forward the registration towards the Home IPTN.

   The Intermediate IPTN provides the functions required to connect the
   Serving IPTN and the Home IPTN during the registration. The
   intermediate IPTN is only present when the Serving IPTN and the Home
   IPTN are not directly connected.
   An IPTN may act as both the Serving IPTN and the Home IPTN.
   Networks involved in calls
   Figure 2 shows the different types of networks that may inter-
   operate for calls in TIPHON compliant systems. A specific call may
   not involve all network types. Each network will include any
   required interconnecting and interworking functions.

   The Home IPTN contains a set of functions required for subscription-
   related operations.
   An IPTN may act as any combination of an Originating IPTN, and/or a
   Home IPTN and/or a Terminating IPTN.

6 Functional Planes
   Each of the networks in the TIPHON generic network model may be
   considered as comprising distinct groupings of functionality. Within
   a network, these functions interact to enable the policies and
   business objectives for that network to be achieved through
   exercising appropriate control of the resources within that network.
   In order to provide a structured analysis of the requirements, the
   concept of 'functional planes' is used. Each functional plane
   contains a high level grouping of functionality.
   IPTNs can be considered to contain sets of similar functions and it
   is possible to consider these functions to be grouped as planes of
   common functionality. The IPTN can be separated into an IP Transport
   plane and an IP Telephony Application plane.

   Figure 3 identifies the following functional planes:
     -IP Telephony Application;
     -IP Transport;
     -SCN;
     -Management.

   terminating functional groupings are associated with different
   networks, the Network Functional Grouping can be separated into an
   Originating Network Functional Grouping and a Terminating Network
   Functional Grouping (see     figure 6)

   Figure 6 also includes Interconnecting Functional Groupings that
   provide functions, e.g. protocol conversions, policy enforcement,
   that enables the networks to communicate.
   NOTE 1:      In some implementations, there may be no need for an
   interconnection function between some networks, but it is necessary
   to include this functionality to develop a consistent model.
   Where there is an intermediate network between the Originating
   Network Functional Grouping and the Terminating Network Functional
   Grouping, the Network Functional Grouping can be further subdivided
   to include one or more Intermediate Network Functional Groupings
   (see Figure 7).

   As in Figure 6, Interconnecting Functional Groupings are included to
   enable the networks to communicate.
   Also, Figure 7 includes an Intermediate Gateway Functional Grouping
   that provides communication with SCNs
   NOTE 2:      the figures do not consider mobility aspects.
   These functional groupings may be used to construct the four
   scenarios as follows:
    - for Scenario 1, the call is from an Originating Terminal
   Functional Grouping to a Terminating Gateway Functional Grouping ;
    - for Scenario 2, the call is from an Originating Gateway
   Functional Grouping to a Terminating Terminal Functional Grouping;
    - for Scenario 3, the call is from an Originating Gateway
   Functional Grouping to a Terminating Gateway Functional Grouping ;
   and
    - for Scenario 4, the call is from an Originating Terminal
   Functional Grouping to a Terminating Terminal Functional Grouping
   using a pair of  Intermediate Gateway Functional Groupings enabling
   communication via an SCN.

8. Functional decomposition of the IP Telephony Application plane
   The architecture for the IP Telephony Application plane consists of
   functional entities organised into functional layers. One functional
   layer builds upon functionality provided by another functional
   layer. Together they provide the telephony application. This
   grouping is useful for the understanding of the functionality
   involved but does not imply any physical implementation. There are
   information flows between the functional entities. Information flows
   may be:
    - between functional entities in the same functional layer;
    - between a functional entity in one functional layer and a
   functional entity in the next functional layer upwards; and
    - between a functional entity in one functional layer and a
   functional entity in the next functional layer downwards.
   A functional entity may have one or more of these types of
   information flow.
   There are information flows between functional entities in the IP
   Telephony Application plane and the other functional planes.
   Where it can be determined that there is a requirement for a
   physical interface between entities residing in separate pieces of
   physical equipment, a reference point will be defined. One reference
   point may encompass multiple distinctive information flows.
   A standardised protocol will be required to support information
   flows in cases where a reference point is defined.

8.1 Introduction to the functional layers
   The TIPHON functional architecture has 5 functional layers: the
   service functional layer, the service control functional layer, the
   call control functional layer, the bearer control functional layer
   and the media functional layer.
   These functional layers are shown in Figure 8. For simplicity only
   two functions are shown in each functional layer with all of the
   possible communication paths within the functional layer and to the
   adjacent functional layers.

                  Application plane.

   In the subsequent sub-clauses each of the functional layers is
   introduced.
8.1.1 The Services functional layer
   The Services functional layer shall support a range of services
   (e.g. Authentication) provided internally to a service  network or
   functional grouping, or provided by third parties either locally or
   remotely via other networks or functional groupings.
   This functional layer has the following functions.


  Service profile     Provides information required for
  function            registration and stores information
                       received during registration. Provides on
                       request information needed for call
                       establishment.

  User profile        Holds information about the user
  function


  Route function      Provides address/number translation, number
                       length determination and telephony routing
                       capabilities.

8.1.2 The Service Control functional layer
   The Service Control functional layer shall contain functionality
   that is needed for the calls but may have a life span longer or
   shorter than the duration of the call (examples are terminal
   registration, call routing). The Service Control functional layer
   shall provide an interface to functions in the Services functional
   layer that may be provided internally to a service network, or
   provided by third parties either locally or remotely via other
   networks.
   This functional layer has the following functions.

  Service Control (SC)
                           Provides support for calls
  function

  Number portability      Provides a routable user name or
                           address to the called user.

  Called User location    Determines where the called user
                           currently is within the service
                           provider network.
  Name to Name            Converts a user name to a routable user
  translation             name.
  Name to address         Provides a routable address associated
  translation             with the user name.
  Call access             Authorises a call to proceed.

  part) Function          service provider.

  Registration (network   Accepts registration of a user at a
  part) Function          terminal.

8.1.3 The Call Control functional layer
   The Call Control functional layer shall maintain a call context. The
   call context allows the services offered by the Bearer Control
   functional layer to provide the connections and capabilities
   requested by the customer as permitted by the service provider. In
   order to achieve this control, the Call Control functional layer may
   request information from the Service Control functional layer. The
   Call Control functional layer sends and receives signalling to users
   and networks.
   This functional layer has the following functions.

  Call Control (CC)      Maintains the call state and, if
  Function               present, provides services that change
                          the call state e.g. call hold, suspend,
                          three way and conferencing.

                          and release of, resources from Bearer
                          Control functions.

8.1.4 The Bearer Control functional layer
   The Bearer Control functional layer manages the logical association
   between pairs of endpoints. Bearer control shall be responsible for
   mapping call topology to individual media flows (e.g. connect
   parties a, b and c together). These flows may be between any pair of
   media processing functions in the media functional layer.
   This layer has the following functional functions:

  Bearer Control (BC)    Allows or disallows media streaming
  Function               based on information from call control

  Bearer negotiation     Negotiates with other Bearer Control
                          functions.
  Media resource         Communicates with the Media Control
  acquisition            function to obtain media resources for
                          the bearer.

8.1.5 The Media Control functional layer
   The Media Control functional layer shall be responsible for the
   properties of the individual media flows. In this functional layer
   media encoding is determined, Quality of Service (QoS) paths are
   reserved and firewalls are controlled in conjunction with the IP
   Transport plane.
   This functional layer has the following functions.

  Media Control (MC)      Provides IP transport addresses for
  functions               media reception and transmission.

   NOTE 6:      Steps 3a and 3b may be initiated in parallel, but the
   completion of bearer establishment may occur prior to establishment
   of the call.

   The Figure 10 shows two terminals and two networks. Each network has
   its own transport network (the clouds at the bottom). In this
   example, the user at Originating terminal (A) requests a call to
   party B. (Note that the functional layers are also present in the
   terminals but this is not shown in the picture.)
   The originating network is asked to set up the call. As a result of
   the request for routing, the Call Control functional layer in the
   originating network is instructed to setup the call to the network
   in which the party B resides. The Call Control functional layers in
   both networks co-operate to establish this call, each communicating
   with its Service Control functional layer for authentication and
   call routing.
   The media communication is done through bearers. Within each network
   the Bearer Control functional layer co-operates with the appropriate
   terminal to establish the bearer properties. Between the networks
   the bearer entities communicate the inter-network bearer properties.
   The Media Control functional layers in each network allocate the
   appropriate firewalls/edge routers in the IP Transport plane and
   establish a QoS channel between them. If a media transcoding or
   other media transformation e.g. echo cancellation is necessary the
   Media Control functional layer performs it.

8.2.3 Relationship between BC, MC and TR entities
   Figure 11 shows how one bearer may be constructed out of multiple
   concatenated media flows each with its own transport. One Bearer
   Control entity communicates with multiple entities in the Media
   Control functional layer. Media flows through each entity in the
   Media Control functional layer. For each flow the entities in the
   Media Control functional layer will allocate transport by
   communicating with the appropriate transport entities.

8.3 Definition of reference points
   Reference points are (groups of) information flows subject of
   standardisation. The rest of this section describes the reference
   points, defines in the IP Telephony Application plane and shows how
   they can be combined to provide the Telephony Application over IP
   Networks.
   This section is structured as follows. Sections 8.3.1 and 8.3.2
   provide the registration and call scenarios. The subsequent sections
   describe the reference points in more detail.

     Figure 16b Right hand side of Reference points for the Scenario 4.

   NOTE:        For the simplicity only one Call Control function is
   showed within each network. However, one network may include more
   than one call control function with a reference point similar to the
   C2 reference point.

8.3.6 SC-Service reference points
   S1:Information flows at S1 provide the capability to store, retrieve
   and delete the registration ticket.
   S2:Information flows at S2 provide the capability to get and set
   properties in the User Profile. For the purposes of: User
   authentication, User authorisation, Call routing, User preferences,
   Allowed services and service options.
   S3:Information flows at S3 provide the capability to get call
   routing information and address translation.

8.3.7 SC-SC reference points
   R1:Information flows at R1 provide the capability required for a
   user to register with the Serving IPTN. It provides the capability
   to convey users ID, terminal ID, terminal capabilities etc.
   R2:Information flows at R2 provide the capability so that networks
   can exchange user registration and information related to user
   profile and subscription.

8.3.8 CC-SC reference points

   SC1:Information flows at SC1 provide the capability to get a ticket
   on an existing registration session.
   SC2:Information flows at SC2 provide the capability to answer
   queries to the user profile.
   SC3:Information flows at SC3 provide the capability to answer access
   and routing requests for calls in the context of Network Functional
   Groupings. Input information may include called address/name,
   caller, calling domain. Output information may include next-hop
   address, preferences and constraints for the call parameters.

8.3.9 CC/BC-CC/BC reference points
   C1:Information flows at C1 provide the capability to establish,
   modify and terminate both calls and bearers to and from the
   terminal.
   C2:Information flows at C2 provide the capability to establish,
   modify and terminate both calls and bearers between non-terminal
   functional groupings.
   C3:Information flows at C3 provide the capability to establish,
   modify and terminate calls and connections between non-terminal
   functional groupings using an SCN.

8.3.10 MC-BC reference points
   N1:Information flows at N1 provide the capability to request, modify
   and delete media paths for the creation of a bearer in the context
   of Terminal Functional Grouping.
   N2:Information flows at N2 provide the capability to request, modify
   and delete media paths for the creation of a bearer and provides the
   capability to control an insertion of information (e.g. tones and
   announcements) into media flows in the context of Network Functional
   Grouping.
   N3 Information flows at N3 provide the capability to request, modify
   and delete media paths for the creation of a bearer in the context
   of Gateway Functional Grouping.
   N4:Information flows at N4 provide the capability to request, modify
   and delete media paths for the creation of a bearer and provides the
   capability to control an insertion of information (e.g. tones and
   announcements) into media flows in the context of Intermediate
   Gateway Functional Grouping.

8.3.11 MC-MC reference points
   M1:Information flows at M1 provide the capability to carry media
   flows between the terminal and the IPN.
   M2:Information flows at M2 provide the capability to carry media
   flows over the IPN.
   M3:Information flows at M3 provide the capability to carry media
   flows over the SCN.

8.3.12 TR-MC reference points
   T1:Information flows at T1 provide the capability to permit, modify
   and inhibit transport capabilities for the terminal, including
   Quality of Service, for the creation of a media flow.

   T2:Information flows at T2 provide the capability to permit, modify
   and inhibit transport capabilities for the IPTN, including Quality
   of Service, for the creation of a media flow.
   T3:Information flows at T3 provide the capability to permit, modify
   and inhibit transport capabilities for the SCN, including Quality of
   Service, for the creation of a media flow.

9 Basic functional entities information flows
   This subclause contains the Message Sequence Charts (MSC) and
   definitions for primitives and their parameters for each reference
   point.
   Annex A contains an overview of functional entities, information
   flows, the Specification and Description Language (SDL) and
   functional entity actions from which the MSC diagrams in this
   subclause are derived.

   These sections are omitted for the sake of brevity. The interested
   reader is referred to the full document, which is publicly available
   and can be found at
   http://docbox.etsi.org/Tech-Org/TIPHON/Document/tiphon/07-
   drafts/wg2/DTS02003/ the current version is 0.10.8. Later versions
   will appear in the same directory.

10. Security Considerations

   The architecture as described in this document has a number of
   security hooks that will be filled in by the TIPHON security group.
   A re-release of the document is planned later this year that will
   incorporate these security elements.
