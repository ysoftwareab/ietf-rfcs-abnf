Abstract

   Detecting Network Attachment (DNA) requires the rapid detection of
   link identity and validation of the current IP configuration [3].
   Even though acquiring the configuration for a new link is outside the
   scope of DNA, mechanisms that can accomplish both DNA and collect
   possible configuration information about the current link will prove
   to be very useful in rapidly changing network environments.  RFC 2461
   defines a Router Discovery (RD) procedure [1] to learn about the
   available access routers on an L3 link.  RFC 2461 [1] also defines
   Neighbor Discovery (ND) procedure to discover neighbors in the same

   link.  This draft recommends a few simple modifications to the Router
   Discovery (RD) procedure defined by RFC 2461 [1] that can lead to
   efficient Router Reachability Detection (RRD), while enabling the
   quick learning of other available routers if the current router is
   not available.

1.  Introduction

   When operating in changing environments, IPv6 hosts may experience
   variations in reachability or configuration state over time.  For
   hosts accessing the Internet over wireless media, such changes may be
   caused by changes in wireless propagation or host motion.

   In these and other cases, IP addressing and default routing
   configuration may be invalid, which prevents successful communication
   with IP nodes on the global Internet.

   Detecting Network Attachment (DNA) in IPv6 is the task of checking
   for changes in the validity of a host's IP configuration.  Changes
   may occur on establishment or disconnection of a link-layer.  For
   newly connected interfaces, need to confirm if their current
   configuration is valid.

   DNA focuses on determining whether the current configuration is
   valid, leaving the actual practice of re-configuration to other
   subsystems if the current configuration is invalid.

   This document identifies the requirements to achieve efficient router
   discovery and reachability detection and makes recommendations in
   terms of modifications to the Router Discovery procedure defined by
   [1].

   The proposed solution in this draft is built upon the following
   design principles:

      The link identifier used by each IP node [3] in a link does not
      need to be the same as long as they can efficiently identify if
      the link is the same link (belonging to the identifier used by the
      IP node) or not after attachment .

      This link identifier, as suggested by this draft, is <Current
      prefix, Current access router address>.  Note that it is possible
      to modify the recommendations in this draft to use a different
      identifier that can be used to uniquely identify the current
      access router.

      The IP nodes are proactive in determining network attachment by
      sending a Router Solicitation message.  This avoids reducing the
      Router Advertisement interval significantly to achieve efficient
      detection of network attachment if the IP nodes remain reactive by
      depending on unsolicited Router Advertisements.

      A Link Up notification from layer-2 is available to initiate the
      proactive transmission of a Router Solicitation message for the IP
      node to be proactive in determining network attachment.


2.  Terms and Abbreviations

   There is an existing DNA terminology draft [6].  This draft does not
   introduce any new terminology not already used by existing drafts.

3.  Neighbor Discovery and Router Discovery

   The Neighbor Discovery procedure defined by RFC 2461 [1] involves the
   exchange of NS (Neighbor Solicitation) and NA (Neighbor
   Advertisement) messages between two IP nodes.  The responding host is
   required to send the Neighbor Advertisement message using unicast
   addressing, thus the NA acts as a confirmation to the receipt of NS.
   Its widely accepted that such an exchange can also be used as a
   bi-directional reachability detection mechanism.

   On the other hand, the Router Discovery procedure [1] requires a RA
   (Router Advertisement) message sent to a multicast address in
   response to the RS (Router Solicitation) message.  Unlike the
   Neighbor Discovery procedure when the RA message is received, the
   source of the RS message can not ascertain whether the RA message is
   in response to its RS message.  Even though RFC 2461 [1] allows for
   the possibility of a unicast RA response, it does not mandate it.

   In order to avoid responses from multiple routers at the same time
   RFC 2461 [1] requires routers wait for a random delay between 0 and
   MAX_RA_DELAY_TIME while not sending more than one multicast RA in
   MIN_DELAY_BETWEEN_RAS time.  (Note: The values for these timers are
   modified in RFC 3775 [2] to lower values.)

   Note that the response to a RS message can be sent by any/all of the
   routers on the link.  If a router that is not the current access
   router responds first the IP node can not be sure whether to accept
   the reponse or to wait in order to provide a chance for it's current
   router to respond.

4.  Router Reachability Detection

   In order to achieve rapid network attachment detection, this draft
   suggests the following requirements to be met by the Router Discovery
   (RD) procedure.

      1) The initiator of the RD procedure MUST be able to verify that
      the response message was generated in response to its solicitation
      message to confirm bi-directional reachability with the router.

      2) The current access router of the initiator MUST have a high
      likelihood of responding to the router solicitation message.

      3) The rate limiting mechanism SHOULD be flexible to allow for the
      possibility of multiple consecutive RS messages arriving at the
      routers within MIN_DELAY_BETWEEN_RAS time.

   This document proposes the following modifications to the RD
   procedure and defines a new procedure called Router reachability
   Detection.

4.1  Router Reachability Detection procedure

   The Router Reachability Detection procedure works as follows: when an
   IP node wants to find out if its current access router is accessible,
   it generates a RS message and it MUST include a current access router
   option in the RS message containing the address of the current access
   router (Note: This address may be the link-local address of the
   router) and MUST included its current global prefix using the prefix
   option defined in RFC 2461 [1].  The IP node SHOULD also include its
   own link layer address using the  tentative source link layer address
   option (SLLAO) in the RS message it sends.  The routers respond to
   the RS message within the random delay generated as described in
   Section 4.3 and Section 4.5.

   If multiple RS messages are received during the random delay time,
   the router MUST note down the link layer addresses if present in the
   RS message SLLAO and the link local address of the source of the RS
   messages.  The router MUST include the link-layer address of the
   source of RS messages using the target link layer option and link
   local address of the source of the RS message using the target
   link-local address option headers in the RA message.

   Using this procedure, an IP node can detect if its current router is
   still available and if not, the IP node will  receive RA messages
   from other routers in the network.  With the receipt of the RA
   message the IP node can also confirm bi-directional reachability to
   the router that sent the RA message based on the sources of RS
   messages identified in that particular RA message.

4.2  Identify the Current Access Router in RS message

   One new option header is defined by this draft in section Section 5.2
   named Current Access Router.  The RS message generated by an IP node



Narayanan               Expires August 21, 2005                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                 DNAv6 RRD                   February 2005


   MUST include at least one newly defined current access router option
   and  also the current prefix information using the prefix option
   defined in RFC 2461 [1] to provide the current access router and
   prefix information to the routers receiving the RS message.  The
   usage of this options is discussed in Section 4.1.

4.3  Higher priority for current access router in responding to RS

   Two new variables named MaxDelayForCurrRouter and
   MinDelayForOtherRouters are defined for routers.  The current access
   router identified in the RS message MUST generate a random delay
   between 0 and MaxDelayForCurrRouter, while all other routers MUST
   generate the random delay between MinDelayForOtherRouters and
   MAX_RA_DELAY_TIME.  The MinDelayForOtherRouters <=
   MaxDelayForCurrRouter.  These two variables can be controlled to
   increase the likelihood of the current router responding first.

   For example, if the MaxDelayForCurrRouter = MinDelayForOtherRouter =
   X milli-seconds < MAX_RA_DELAY_TIME, the probability of current
   router responding before other routers is 1, provided that the
   current router didn't transmit an RA within MIN_DELAY_BETWEEN_RAS
   time (This problem of delay introduced by the rate limiting variable
   MIN_DELAY_BETWEEN_RAS is addressed in Section 4.5).  The RECOMMENDED
   value for the both MaxDelayForCurrRouter and MinDelayForOtherRouters
   is zero.

4.4  Identify received RS messages in RA

   The Target Link Layer address defined by RFC 2461 [1] will be used in
   the RA message for including all the link-layer addresses and/or the
   newly defined option header in section Section 5.1 to include the
   link-local addresses of the IP nodes from which RS messages were
   received.  This information in the RA message will be useful for the
   IP nodes to verify bi-directional reachability to routers.  The
   router learn the link layer address of the source of the RS message
   from the tentative source link layer address (SLLAO) option in the RS
   message.  The usage of these options is discussed in Section 4.1.

4.5  Token bucket based rate limiting RA messages

   Instead of rate-limiting the number of multicast RA messages by
   restricting one message per MIN_DELAY_BETWEEN_RAS as describe by RFC
   2461 [1], it is recommended that the router maintain a token bucket
   of size MAX_RA_TOKEN_BUCKET.  This recommedation is made to avoid the
   MIN_DELAY_BETWEEN_RAS delay in responding to a RS message if the RS
   message was received immediately after a RA message was sent.
   Implementing the MIN_DELAY_BETWEEN_RAS limit will affect the network
   attachment delay when more than one IP node need to detect network

   attachment around the same time.

   The token bucket mechanism is implemented as follows.  A token is
   added to the bucket at the rate of RA_TOKEN_BUCKET_RATE.  When the
   router has to send a RA message (after the random delay introduced by
   Section 4.3 has expired)it checks the bucket for a token, if the
   bucket is empty, the router waits until a token is added to the
   bucket.  If a token is available, the router removes the token from
   the bucket and sends the RA message.  Any token generated when the
   bucket is full MUST be discarded.

6.  Security Considerations

   Since this document depends on the existing protocol mechanisms
   defined in RFC 2461 [1], all the security consideration mentioned in
   RFC 2461 are applicable to this draft.  The token bucket based rate



Narayanan               Expires August 21, 2005                 [Page 8]

   limiting mechanism suggested here makes a DOS attack possible, but
   the constraints placed by the constant MAX_RA_TOKEN_BUCKET can
   control the impact of such DOS attacks because after producing
   consecutive messages based on the tokens left in the bucket, the
   responses will be limited to one every MIN_DELAY_BETWEEN_RAS time.
   Allowing for MAX_RA_TOKEN_BUCKET number of RA messages to be sent
   almost consecutively makes efficient network attachment detection
   possible when a series of upto MAX_RA_TOKEN_BUCKET IP nodes move into
   the area covered by particular access router.

7.  Constants

   The following values are suggested for the constants defined in this
   document (these values need to be refined based on the implementation
   and simulation experience):

   MAX_RA_TOKEN_BUCKET: 20

   MaxDelayForCurrRouter: 50 ms

   MinDelayForOtherRouters: 50 ms

Appendix A.  Complete DNA solution with RRD & Probabilistic FastRA

   The mechanisms recommended by this internet-draft achieves efficient
   verification of the current configuration when the IP node has not
   moved away from its current link.  It also confirms bi-directional
   reachability with the current access router in the same scenario.
   Intergrating this method with a fast router advertisement method will
   basically provide the required complete solution for the DNA problem
   [3].  In this appendix, a brief description on how such integration
   can be done with probabilistic fast router advertisement[5] is
   presented.

   The following simple modifications to probabilistic fastra are needed
   to combine with RRD:

      When a current access router is identified in the RS message, the
      current access router MUST set its probability of responding to 1.

      When a current access router is identified in the RS message,
      other routers that have knowledge of the presence of that access

      by RFC2461 [1].  These other routers MAY elect to follow the
      probabilities for P(slot_i) as specified by the [5].

      When a current access router is identified in the RS message,
      other router that do not have knowledge of the presence of that
      access router in the link, SHOULD follow the recommedation in [5]
      with the following modification to the delay calculation.  If
      SlotNumber = 0; then delay = 10 ms; else delay = slotNumber *
      ProbFastRASlotTime.


Appendix B.  Comparisons to ECS and LCS

   This section presents a simple analysis based on the work done in [4]
   to compare the proposed Router Reachability Detection scheme with the
   well know eager configuration switching (ECS) and lazy configuration
   switching (LCS) schemes.

   The ECS mechanism accepts the first RA received (solicited or
   unsolicited) from the network and if the RA contains different
   configuration from the IP node's current configuration, the IP node
   changes its configuration based on the newly received RA.  LCS
   mechanism attempts reachability testing using a NS-NA exchange with
   the current router before soliciting new router information or before
   accepting the new Router Advertisement.  A brief analysis of the
   average cost introduced by the schemes LCS and ECS are given in [4].
   Assuming the following costs for the operations:

      N - Reachability test success (with NS/NA)
      T - Reachability test failure (timeout)
      R - Router Advertisement reception (This will be the average
      random delay introduced for responding to the RS message)
      C - Host reconfiguration

   The probability that there is a L3 link change given that the L2
   point of attachment has changed is

      p = (number of L3 links)/(number of L2 Point of attachment)

   If nr represents the number of routers in each L3 link and NR the
   total number of routers.

   The probability of the received RA being from a router different from
   the current access router is

      p1 = (sum of all (nr - 1)/ NR)

   Note that if there is a single router on a L3 link, then (nr - 1)

   will be zero leading to

      p1 = 0

   The mean cost of Eager Configuration switching is:

      Cost(ECS)= (R + C) *  (p + p1)

   And the cost of Lazy switching is:

      Cost(LCS)= (T + R + C) * p + (1 - p) * N

   To extend this analysis to the Router Reachability Detection (RRD)
   procedure requires the definition of a new variable p2 which is the
   probability that the current access router will respond to the Router
   Solicitation message first.  This probability is controlled by the
   choice of values for the variable MaxDelayForCurrRouter and
   MinDelayForOtherRouters.


           (MaxDelayForCurrRouter - MinDelayForOtherRouters) * (nr -1 )
   p2 =1 - ------------------------------------------------------------
                            MAX_RA_DELAY_TIME * nr

   Note that, if MaxDelayForCurrRouter = MinDelayForOtherRouters, then
   p2=1, while if MinDelayForOtherRouters = 0 and MaxDelayForCurrRouter
   = MAX_RA_DELAY_TIME (which will be the values for the current Router
   Discovery scheme defined by RFC 2461 [1]), then p2 = 1 / nr.

   If the cost of receiving a Router Advertisement is R1 if the current
   router is available (This will be the average random delay (0,
   MaxDelayForCurrRouter)) and R2 if the current router is not available
   (This will be the average random delay (MinDelayForOtherRouter,
   MAX_RA_DELAY_TIME)), then

      Cost(RRD) = R2  *  p + R1 * (1 - p) + p * C +  p1 * (1-p2) * C

   It can be seen from this expression that when p1 = 0, (i.e.  when you
   don't have multiple routers in the same L3 link), RRD has the same
   cost as ECS.  When p1 is non-zero, and if p2 is maintained at 1, RRD
   performs better than ECS by avoiding the erroneous configuration
   changes.  This improvement in cost is significant only if C is large
   compared to other costs.
