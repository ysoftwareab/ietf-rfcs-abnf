                     FHR Source Network Prohibition
           draft-zhou-pim-fhr-source-network-prohibition-00

Abstract

   This document proposes a multicast stream prohibition method based on
   FHR(First Hop Router) sending unicast PIM messages towards source
   which enables switch to prohibit unnecessary multicast stream towards
   FHR.

1.  Introduction

   The Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) is now the most popular
   multicast routing protocol.  The router on the edge of PIM routing
   domain is called PIM First Hop Router (FHR).  PIM has four modes:
   Sparse Mode (SM), Dense Mode (DM), Bidirectional PIM (Bidir-PIM),
   Source-Specific Multicast (SSM).

   In many typical deployment scenarios, link layer switches which exist
   between multicast sources and PIM FHR have to forward all multicast
   streams to PIM FHR.  This will lead to waste of switches' cache and
   link bandwidth.  The problem has been discribed in detail in the
   draft of draft-dizhou-pim-umf-problem-statement.

   This document proposes a method for PIM FHR to send UNICAST PIM Prune
   or Join messages towards source which could be snooped by switches to
   stop or forward multicast streams towards FHR.

2.  Terminology

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]

   With respect to PIM, this document follows the terminology that has
   been defined in RFC 4601 [RFC4601].

3.  Protocol Description

   Because DF of Bidir-PIM has to always forward multicast to RP link,
   so Bidir-PIM has no need to refuse multicast streams.  The protocol
   of FSNP (FHR Source Network Prohibition) is only designed for PIM SM,
   SSM and DM.

3.1.  Protocol Description for PIM SSM

   When PIM FHR receives a multicast stream, it creates an entry of
   (S,G) if the entry did not exist.  And it judges whether the (S,G)
   entry has out interfaces.  If the (S,G) has no out interface, the PIM
   FHR SHALL send out an UNICAST PIM Prune message towards the multicast
   source.  The upstream neighbor address in the message is the source
   address, and the destination address of the message is that of the
   source.  The UNICAST PIM Prune message is rate-limited.

   When PIM FHR receives a PIM Join or IGMP Membership Report and
   creates the first out interface for the (S,G) entry, it SHALL send
   out an UNICAST PIM Join message towards source immediately.  It MAY
   send some PIM Join messages in a high frequency for reliability.

   When PIM FHR receives a PIM Prune or IGMP Leave and deletes the last
   out interface for the (S,G) entry, then it SHALL send out UNICAST PIM
   Prune message towards source.

   Only when source address of the multicast stream is in the same
   network with receiving interface, or when FHR has no RPF neighbour
   for the (S,G) entry shall FHR send out UNICAST PIM Join or Prune
   message towards source.

3.2.  Protocol Description for PIM SM

   When PIM FHR receives a multicast stream, it creates an entry of
   (S,G) if the entry did not exist.  Then if FHR is DR it shall send
   register message to RP.  If FHR receives register-stop messages and
   there is no out-interfaces for (S,G) entry, it SHALL send out an
   UNICAST PIM Prune message towards the multicast source.  The upstream
   neighbor address in the message is the source address, and the
   destination address of the message is that of the source.  The
   UNICAST PIM Prune message is rate-limited.

   When PIM FHR receives a PIM Join message or IGMP Membership Report
   and creates the first out interface for the (S,G) entry, it SHALL
   send out an UNICAST PIM Join message towards source immediately.  It
   MAY send some PIM Join messages in a high frequency for reliability.

   When PIM FHR receives a PIM Prune message or IGMP Leave and deletes

   the last out interface for the (S,G) entry, then it SHALL send out
   UNICAST PIM Prune messages towards source.

   Only when source address of the multicast stream is in the same
   network with receiving interface, or when FHR has no RPF neighbour
   for the (S,G) entry shall FHR send out UNICAST PIM Join or Prune
   message towards source.

3.3.  Protocol Description for PIM DM

   When PIM FHR receives a multicast stream, it creates an entry of
   (S,G) if the entry did not exist.  Then FHR shall send multicast
   stream to all downstream interfaces.  If FHR receives PIM Prune
   messages and there is no out-interface to forward multicast stream
   for (S,G) entry, it SHALL send out an UNICAST PIM Prune message
   towards the multicast source.  The upstream neighbor address in the
   message is the source address, and the destination address of the
   message is that of the source.  The UNICAST PIM Prune message is
   rate-limited.

   When PIM FHR receives a PIM graft message or IGMP Membership Report
   and creates a forwarding out interface for the (S,G) entry that had
   no forwarding out interface before, it SHALL send out an UNICAST PIM
   Join message towards source immediately.  It MAY send some PIM Join
   messages in a high frequency for reliability.

   When PIM FHR receives a PIM Prune message or IGMP Leave and deletes
   the last forwarding out interface for the (S,G) entry, then it SHALL
   send out UNICAST PIM Prune messages towards source.

   Only when source address of the multicast stream is in the same
   network with receiving interface, or when FHR has no RPF neighbour
   for the (S,G) entry shall FHR send out UNICAST PIM Join or Prune
   message towards source.

4.  Other solutions

   The UNICAST PIM Join message could be replaced with UNICAST IGMP
   Graft like message, and the UNICAST PIM Prune message could be also
   replaced with UNICAST IGMP Prune like message.  But some new types of
   IGMP/MLD messages shall be designed.
