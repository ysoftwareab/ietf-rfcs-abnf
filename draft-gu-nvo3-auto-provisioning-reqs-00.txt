             Virtual Network Auto-Provisioning Requirements
              draft-gu-nvo3-auto-provisioning-reqs-00.txt

Abstract

   [draft-ietf-nvo3-framework-07] and [draft-ietf-nvo3-overlay-problem-
   statement-04] all have information on _Auto-provisioning/Service
   discovery_ or _Dynamic Provisioning_. Some further information should
   be helpful to clarify how automatic virtual network/service
   provisioning can be done in NVO3.  This document describes the NVO3
   general virtual network provisioning processes and discusses how VN
   can be automatically provided and related requirements.

1.  Introduction

   There are Tens of thousands servers or even more in datacenters, and
   up to millions of virtual networks should be supported for the
   public/Internet users.  It_s a huge burden for provider_s network
   administrators to configure the NVEs and to deploy these virtual
   networks.  It should be much better there_re automatic configuration
   tools exist for network administrators. [draft-ietf-nvo3-framework-
   07] had already discussed the possibilities of Auto-provisioning
   /Service discovery[3.1.5.2].  This document first shows the basic and
   main steps for VN provisioning, then clarifies the functions needed
   for automatic provisioning of VN, and further discusses two
   mechanisms for VN automatic provisioning and the related requirements
   are discussed in the end.

3.  NVO3 Virtual Network provisioning

   Currently customers can obtain virtual network service from cloud/
   datacenter services providers.  The process may include some main
   steps:

   Step1.  The customer submits the VN requirements to services
   provider.  Note that, customers can submit their services
   requirements by provider_s web portal, or, email, telephone, fax, or
   even visiting provider_s office, etc.

   Step2.  The provider_s network administrators (properbally after
   clarification) map these requirements to some network nodes and
   further to network configurations which can be used to realize the VN
   provisioning.

   Step3.  The provider_s network administrators configure each related
   network nodes manually.  These configurations include VM platforms,
   related NVE/switch and Gateway configurations.

   Step4.  After all related configurations have been successfully
   executed the VN provisioning is done and the provider can inform the
   customer the VN has been available and can be used regularly.

   In current practices always there are tens thousands of servers in
   datacenter, an there are large amount of VN needs to provision and
   the network administrator can not finish the related configuration
   soon, so the customer needs to wait to get the VN.  Then in some
   circumstances the VN automatic provisioning mechanisms are necessary.

   This document provides some detailed discussion.

4.  Automatic VN provisioning Discussions

4.1.  Detailed VN provisioning procedures

   According to draft-ietf-nvo3-use-case-03, draft-ietf-nvo3-framework-
   07, and draft-ietf-nvo3-arch-01, and the current services practices,
   Figure 1 shows the typical and abstract VN provisioning and usage
   environments.

   Generally, the Internet users/ (enterprise) VN customers use the VN
   services provider_s website/Web Portal to submit the VN requirements.
   In figure 1, for simplicity the assumption been made that the NVA_s
   functionalities include some more related services provisioning roles
   which may be finished by administrators.  The gateway/NVE supports
   secure access to customer_s VPN or enterprise_s gateway to connect
   the VN to enterprise internal network.  And the hypervisor and its

   connected switch or other network appliances can be used as NVE
   concurrently in this document.

   Typical VN provisioning and usage environments:

   Customers can automatic login into the portal and do the services
   requirements submission.  The related parameters include, for
   example, No of sites, No of VM in each site, VM access bandwidth,
   Internet access support, Internet access bandwidth, IP address type
   and/or IP address range, the bandwidth between sites or access
   points, security gateway connections, etc.

   The portal clarifies the services requirements, maps to underlining
   networks, translates the requirements to parameters and configuration
   commands, and distributes the parameters and configuration commands
   to related NVE(s) and/or VM orchestration system.

   VM orchestration system prepares the requested VMs using the related
   parameters.

   NVE executes the configuration commands using the related parameters.

   Configure each VM to connect it to related NVE according some rules.

   For each VM configure related NVE interface to connect to the VM.

   Optionally configure NVE to execute related protocols to realize
   information exchange between NVEs and other functions.

   Optionally configure related GW to connect VN to Internet to realize
   VN_s Internet access.

   Optionally, support VN network administrators configure and manage
   their own VN automatically or manually.

   NVEs send execution and/or status information to NVA, and NVA
   synthesis these related information to form a VN provisioning report
   which will be sent to customer.

   The following are the key steps for VN provisioning:

   1.  Web-based VN requirements collection;

   2.  Web portal/NVA maps the requirements to related NVEs and servers,
   and optional gateways, and further translates the requirements to
   configuration activities/commands.

   3.  NVA delivers these configurations commands to related NVEs/
   gateways.

   4.  NVA delivers these configurations commands to VM orchestration
   system to prepare requested VMs.

   5.  VMs join the VN.

   6.  NVEs exchange information each other by protocols or other
   mechanisms.

   7.  NVEs send status and execution information to NVA.

   8.  NVA forms VN provisioning status information to customer.

   Note that some steps can be executed concurrently.

   Step 1, 2, and 8 are out of scope of NVO3, we will give no further
   discussion here and will focus on the other steps.  Note that for
   step 2, at least some mapping information shall be obtained from the
   requirements for consequent configurations/execution.

   Step 3-4, and step 6-7 can be implemented using existing technologies
   or by current practice, for example, manual configuration and so on.

   This document mainly discusses how step 3-5 can be automatically
   executed, includes two auto-provisioning mechanisms.

   The first mechanism follows the traditional management process but
   provide automatic executions of some manual configurations.  The
   second method based on NVE auto-discovery mechanism/protocol.

4.2.  Management initiated VN Auto-provisioning

   Management initiated VN Auto-provisioning means the VN automatic
   provisioning procedures initiated by provider_s network administrator
   after VN provisioning parameters are already.

   Generally, a VN can be deployed on (mapped to) some VNEs and all the
   related VNEs connected each other through the underlining
   infrastructure network, and all the VN_s related VM/server are
   connected to one or more NVEs.  The VN Auto provisioning
   configuration includes:

   Automatic collecting of VN requirements.

   Mapping the requirements to NVEs, VM platforms and other related
   network entities.

   Translating the requirements to corresponding configuration commands
   and related parameters.

   Deliver these configuration commands and related parameters to
   related network entities.

   Automatic execution of these commands in nodes, for example,
   including the automatic creation of VRF,the configuration of the
   interfaces which connect VM to NVE, routing protocol configuration,
   optionally other protocol configuration, etc.

   Update configurations executions.

   Execution results and status information reporting.

4.2.1.  Management initiated mechanism requirements

   Req-1: Standard NVA-NVE/GW management interfaces, includes interface
   protocol and related parameters.

   Req-2: Standard NVA-Hypervisor/VM Orchestration System management
   interfaces, includes interface protocol and related parameters.

   Req-3: Optional, automatic routing protocol configuration.

   Detailed information, TBD

4.2.2.  Conclusion Remarks

   As shows above, following the typical manual configuration procedures
   there are lot of works to do to standardize the related protocols to
   support VN auto-provisioning if it were impossible.

   In future, the VN auto-provisioning is hopeful for NETCONF/NETMOD in
   IETF, NSMWG in DMTF all have already started to do some works to help
   to realize the VN automatic provisioning.

4.3.  VM initiated VN Auto-provisioning

   Initial preparation for VN provisioning: obtain the VN requirements,
   clarifying/auditing, VN name or/and VN-ID decision, optional security
   information decision, for example User-ID/password decision, and the
   VN_s Internet access Gateway_s configuration information.  And the
   basic assumption is all related network entities or underlining
   infrastructure supports mentioned functions.

   VM preparation, incl.  VM creation and optional related network
   configuration, e.g.  MAC address and or IP address allocation, etc.

   VM broadcasts auto-discovery packet to discover NVE.  All the NVEs in
   the broadcast domain acknowledged the NVE auto-discovery packets.

   VM chooses one NVE as the serving NVE according some rules and send
   request packet to join the VN.

   NVE authenticates the VM for specific VN, supported by NVA.  If VM
   pass the authentication then VNA return the related VN parameters to
   NVE.  The parameters may include VN-ID, MAC address, IP address,
   create VRF, and so on.

   NVE creates the VRF and auto-configure NVE using received parameters.

   NVE choose Session-ID, or other parameters as NVE-VM connection
   identifier (and form a secure tunnel) and return these parameters to
   VM.

   VM uses these parameters to communicate with NVE.

Internet-DrafVirtual Network Auto-Provisioning Requirements    July 2014


   Optionally, VM authentication triggers NVA send Create VRF command
   and related parameters/information to GW for specific VN to establish
   secure tunnel for VN_s Internet access.

   VNE through NVA reports VN execution results and other status.

   Finished all above steps, a VN is created automatically for the
   customer.

4.3.1.  VM initiated mechanism requirements

   Req-1: NVE auto-discovery protocol, be used to discover NVE
   automatically and further automatic join NVE and trigger NVE to auto-
   configure the related VN.

   Req-2: NVE auto-discovery protocol support and efficiently deliver
   the related parameters, include MAC address, IP address, VN-ID,
   Session-ID, etc.

   Req-3: VM authentication to VN by using the existing protocols such
   as EAP or IEEE802.1x, etc.

   Req-4: NVE supports automatic execution of create VRF command and
   configuration.

   Req-5: Optional, automatic routing protocol configuration.

4.3.2.  VNE Auto-discovery protocol Comparison with VDP

   To be provided.

4.3.3.  Conclusion Remarks

   This VM-initiated mechanism based on VNE auto-discovery protocol and
   some extensions of existing protocols to find the serving VNE and
   auto-join the NVE.  It_s flexible and avoids some difficulties
   inherited from typical management procedures.  It_s hopeful to help
   to realize VN auto-provisioning in datacenter.

5.  Discussions and Conclusions

   This document discussed two different kinds of automatic VN
   provisioning mechanism.  The first one, management initiated
   automatic procedures include lots of general management interface
   standardization works, the second one, based on NVE auto-discovery
   protocol and some extensions of existing protocols, is simple and
   flexible and it owes other advantages such as support VM migration
   and further to provide high secure transport mechanism potentially.
