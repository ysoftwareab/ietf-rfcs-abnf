1.  Introduction

   The Bundle Protocol Security (BPSec) [I-D.ietf-dtn-bpsec]
   specification provides inter-bundle integrity and confidentiality
   features for networks deploying the Bundle Protocol (BP)
   [I-D.ietf-dtn-bpbis].  BPSec defines a set of BP extension blocks to
   carry cipher suite results and associated meta-data, but does not
   define a common set of supported cipher suites.

   This document defines an integrity cipher suite and a confidentiality
   cipher suite suitable for populating BPSec Block Integrity Blocks
   (BIBs) and Block Confidentiality Blocks (BCBs), respectively.

   This purpose of the cipher suites described in this document is
   twofold.  First, these suites should be used to test the
   interoperability of BPSec implementations.  Second, this
   specification can serve as a template to be followed by other BPSec
   cipher suite authors.

   The intent of these cipher suite definitions is to provide a
   mechanism for interoperability testing.  There is no claim that these
   cipher suites are suitable for operational deployment in any
   particular networking scenario.  Further, there is no requirement
   that these cipher suites be used in any operational network
   deployments.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

3.  Cipher Suite BIB-HMAC256-SHA256

3.1.  Overview

   This integrity cipher suite provides a signed hash over the security
   target based on the use of the SHA-256 message digest algorithm
   [RFC4634] combined with HMAC [RFC2104] with a 256 bit truncation
   length.  This formulation is based on the HMAC 256/256 algorithm
   defined in [COSE] Table 7: HMAC Algorithm Values.

   The BIB-HMAC256-SHA256 ciphersuite has ciphersuite ID value 0x01.

3.2.  Key Considerations

   Keys used with this specification MUST be symmetric and 256 bits in
   length.

   This cipher suite provides no requirements on the configuration or
   management of keys.

3.3.  Canonicalization Algorithms

   BIB-HMAC256-SHA256 uses the standard canonicalization algorithms
   defined in BPSec and operates over the entire contents of the
   security target data block.  This cipher suite does not include
   hashing over other parts of the target block header, such as the
   block type and block length.

3.4.  Cipher Suite Parameter Definitions

   BIB-HMAC256-SHA256 defines the following cipher suite parameters.

4.  Cipher Suite BCB-AES-GCM-128

4.1.  Overview

   This confidentiality cipher suite provides cipher text to replace the
   data contents of the target block using the AES cipher operating in
   GCM mode [AES-GCM].  This formulation is based on the A128GCM
   algorithm defined in [COSE] Table 9: Algorithm Value for AES-GCM.

   The BCB-AES-GCM-128 ciphersuite has ciphersuite ID value 0x02.

4.2.  Key Considerations

   Keys used with this specification MUST be symmetric and 128 bits in
   length.

   This cipher suite provides no requirements on the configuration or
   management of keys.

4.3.  Canonicalization Algorithms

   BCB-AES-GCM-128 uses the standard canonicalization algorithms defined
   in BPSec and operates over the entire contents of the security target
   data block.  This cipher suite does not include encryption over other
   parts of the target block header, such as the block type and block
   length.

4.4.  Cipher Suite Parameter Definitions

   BCB-AES-GCM-128 defines the following cipher suite parameters.  It
   should be noted in this specification there is no additional
   authenticated data passed in to the AES-GCM cipher.  The plaintext is
   the only data input and MUST be the entire data contents of the
   target block.

                        BCB-AES-GCM-128 Parameters

   +------+----------------+---------+---------------------------------+
   | Parm |   Parm Name    |   CBOR  |           Description           |
   |  Id  |                |   Type  |                                 |

   |      |                |  string |  the key management system and  |
   |      |                |  (major |  used to transport an ephemeral |
   |      |                | type 2) |   key protected by a long-term  |
   |      |                |         |               key.              |
   |  2   | Initialization |   byte  |   The initialization vector. A  |
   |      |     Vector     |  string |    random value between 8-16    |
   |      |                |  (major | bytes. 12 bytes is recommended. |
   |      |                | type 2) |                                 |
   +------+----------------+---------+---------------------------------+

                                  Table 3

4.5.  Security Result Definitions

   BCB-AES-GCM-128 defines the following security results.  It should be
   noted that cipher text is not a security result as the resultant
   cipher text is stored in the target block.  When operating in GCM
   mode, AES produces cipher text of the same size as its plain text
   and, therefore, no security results are necessary to capture padding
   information.
