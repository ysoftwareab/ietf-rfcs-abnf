1.  Introduction

   This specification defines an XML format for describing Atom
   Publishing Protocol [I-D.ietf-atompub-protocol]Collection resources.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119], as
   scoped to those conformance targets.

   This specification uses XML Namespaces [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114]
   to uniquely identify XML element names.

     "app":  "http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom-Introspection"

   This specification uses terms from the XML Infoset [W3C.REC-xml-
   infoset-20040204].  However, this specification uses a shorthand; the
   phrase "Information Item" is omitted when naming Element Information
   Items.  Therefore, when this specification uses the term "element,"
   it is referring to an Element Information Item in Infoset terms.


3.  APP Introspection Documents

   This specification describes the format for Atom Publishing Protocol
   Introspection Documents.

   An Introspection Document represents zero or more APP Collections and
   Workspaces.  A Workspace is a logical collections of related APP
   Collections.  The root of the Introspection document is the app:
   introspection element.

     namespace app = "http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom-Introspection"
     start = appIntrospection

   Introspection Documents are specified in terms of the XML Information
   Set, serialised as XML 1.0 [W3C.REC-xml-20040204] and identified with
   the "application/app-introspection+xml" media type.  Introspection
   Documents MUST be well-formed XML.  This specification does not
   define a DTD for Introspection Documents, and hence does not require
   them to be valid (in the sense used by XML).

   APP Introspection allows for the use of IRI's [RFC3987], xml:base
   [W3C.REC-xmlbase-20010627] and xml:lang in the same fashion described
   in Section 2 of the Atom Syndication Format specification [I-D.ietf-

   atompub-format].

3.1.  Example

   Simple Example

   <?xml version="1.0" ?>
   <app:introspection
     xmlns:app="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom-Introspection">
    <app:collection
     title="Bookmarks"
     type="entry"
     href="http://example.com/bookmarks" />
    <app:collection
     title="Photos"
     href="http://example.com/photos" />
   </app:introspection>

   Workspace Example

   <?xml version="1.0" ?>
   <app:introspection
     xmlns:app="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom-Introspection">
    <app:workspace title="My Weblog">
     <app:collection
      title="Entries"
      type="entry"
      href="http://myblog.example.com/entries" />
     <app:collection
      title="Photos"
      type="image/*"
      href="http://myblog.example.com/photos" />
     <app:collection
      title="Files"
      href="http://myblog.example.com/files" />
    </app:workspace>
   </app:introspection>


4.  Element Definitions

4.1.  The 'app:introspection' Element

   The 'app:introspection' Element is the root of APP Introspection
   Documents.

Internet-Draft              APP Introspection              November 2005


     appIntrospection =
       element app:introspection {
         atomCommonAttributes,
         ( appWorkspace*,
         & appCollection*,
         & extensionElement* )
       }

   This specification assigns no significance to the order of the child
   elements of 'app:introspection'.

4.2.  The 'app:workspace' Element

   The 'app:workspace' Element represents a logical collection of
   related APP Collections.

     appWorkspace =
       element app:workspace {
         atomCommonAttributes,
         & attribute title (text),
         ( appCollection*,
           & extensionElement )
       }

   The 'title' attribute specifies a human-readable, language-sensitive
   label for the workspace.

   This specification assigns no significance to the order of the child
   elements of 'app:workspace'.

4.3.  The 'app:collection' Element

   The 'app:collection' Element represents a collection resource as
   specified by the Atom Publishing Protocol.

     appCollection =
       element app:collection {
         atomCommonAttributes,
         & attribute title (text),
         & attribute href (IRI),
         & attribute type ( 'entry' | extensionType )?,
         ( extensionElement )
       }

     extensionType = ( NMTOKEN | mediaType | mediaRange )

   The 'title' attribute specifies a human-readable, language-sensitive
   label for the collection.

Internet-Draft              APP Introspection              November 2005


   The 'href' attribute specifies the IRI of an APP collection resource.

   The 'type' attribute MAY be used to specify the types of resources
   contained by the collection.  A value of 'entry' indicates that the
   collection membership consists entirely of Atom Entry Documents.  If
   the collection element does not contain a 'type' attribute, the
   membership of the collection SHOULD be considered to be
   unconstrained.  If the value specified is a media type or media
   range, the membership of the collection SHOULD be considered to be
   constrained to resources of the specified type or covered by the
   specified range.  If the 'type' attribute specifies a value that is
   not understood by the an application, the application MUST ignore the
   attribute as if the attribute were not present.


5.  Security Considerations

   TBD


6.  IANA Considerations

   An Introspection Document can be identified by the following media
   type.

          As defined in this specification.
          In addition, as this media type uses the "+xml" convention,
