Internet-Draft  IPv6 Packet Transmission over IEEE 802.16      June 2006


1.  Introduction

   Recently, broadband wireless access network is emerging for wireless
   communication for user requirements such as high quality data/voice
   service, fast mobility, wide coverage, etc.  The IEEE 802.16 Working
   Group on broadband wireless access standards develops standards and
   recommended practices to support the development and deployment of
   broadband wireless metropolitan area networks.

   As the deployment of wireless broadband access network progresses,
   users will be connected to IPv6 networks.  This document specifies
   the frame format for transmission of IPv6 packets and the method of
   forming IPv6 link-local addresses and statelessly autoconfigured
   addresses on IEEE 802.16 networks.  It also specifies how to send
   IPv6 unicast and multicast packets over IEEE 802.16 networks.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].

2.  Terminology

   SS: Subscriber Station.  A general equipment set providing
   connectivity between subscriber equipment and a BS.

   MS: Mobile Station.  A station in the mobile service intended to be
   used while in motion or during halts at unspecified points.  A mobile
   station (MS) is always a subscriber station (SS).

   BS: Base Station.  A generalized equipment set providing
   connectivity, management and control of MS connections.  A
   unidirectional mapping between BS and MS medium access control (MAC)
   peers for the purpose of transporting a service flow's traffic.
   Connections are identified by a connection identifier (CID).  All
   traffic is carried on a connection.

   PHS : Payload Header Suppression.

   PDU : Protocol Data Unit.  This refers to the data format passed from
   the lower edge of the 802.16 MAC to the 802.16 PHY, which typically
   contains SDU data after fragmentation, encryption, etc.

   SDU : Service Data Unit.  This refers to the data format passed to
   the upper edge of the 802.16 MAC

3.  Maximum Transmission Unit

   IEEE 802.16 permits fragmentation and reassembly.  This capabilities
   are compleletely different from IP fragmentation and reassembly
   process.

   Fragmentation is the process by which a MAC SDU is divided into one
   or more MAC PDU.  This process is undertaken to allow efficient use
   of availabe bandwidth relative to the QoS requirements of
   connection's service flow.

   The default MTU size for IPv6 packets over IEEE 802.16 is not defined
   in [IEEE802.16].  Fragmentation frame size can be variable according
   to the bandwidth relative to the QoS requirements of connection's
   service flow.  Also, it may be dependent on type of Convergence
   Sublayers (CS).  For example, the default MTU size for IPv6 packets
   on an Ethernet CS would be 1500 octets or less.  With 1400 octets as
   the PMTU at the IPv6 CS, there is still enough bytes left (100) to
   account for any tunneling in the Aceess Router.  Mannual
   configuration of each node may be required, if necessary.

4.  Frame Format

   IEEE 802.16 [IEEE802.16] defines the MAC and PHY layers for OFDM and
   OFDMA-based broadband wireless access.

   IEEE 802.16 PDU (Protocol Data Unit) which is the data format passed
   from the lower edge of the 802.16 MAC to the 802.16 PHY, which
   typically contains SDU data after fragmentation, encryption, etc.
   consists of a 6-byte MAC header, various optional subheaders, and a
   data payload.

   The 802.16 6-byte MAC header carries the Connection Identifer (CID)
   of the connection with which the PDU is associated.

   It is importmant to see that there is no source or destination MAC
   address in IEEE 802.16 the MAC header format.  Similar to general
   point-to-point links, the MAC address is not used for link-layer
   transmission.  Hence, mapping unicast or multicast addresses to IEEE
   802.16 MAC addresses is unnecessary.  Also, link-local addressess may
   be not needed for transmission of link-local destination packets.
   Instead, CID is used to identify connections to equivalent peers in
   the MAC of the BS and the MS in IEEE 802.16 networks.

   IEEE 820.16 SDU (Service Data Unit) which is the data format passed
   to the upper edge of the 802.16 MAC.

   IEEE 802.16 Convergence Sublayer (CS) provides the tunneling of
   IP(v6) packets over IEEE 802.16 air-link.  The tunnels are identified
   by the Connection Identifier (CID).  Generally, CS performs the
   following functions in terms of IP packet transmission: 1) Receipt of
   protocol data units (PDUs) from the higher layer, 2) Performing
   classification and CID mapping of the PDUs, 3) Delivering the PDUs to
   the appropriate MAC SAP, 4) Receipt of PDUs from the peer MAC SAP.

   [IEEE802.16] defines several CSs for carrying IP packets.  The
   several CSs are classified into two types of CS: IP CS and Ethernet
   CS.  Frame formats are different accordding to the CS types.

   IPv6 packets can be transmitted in 802.16 frames.  In case of IP CS
   type, the data field contains the IPv6 header and payload, as shown
   in Fig 1.  With Ethernet CS, Ethernet header MUST be included in
   802.16 frame's data field, as shown in Fig 2.

5.  Stateless Autoconfiguration and Link-Local Addresses

   Like other IEEE 802 interfaces, the Interface Identifier for an IEEE
   802.16 interface is based on the EUI-64 identifier derived from the
   interface's built-in 48-bit IEEE 802 address.

   The Interface Identifier is then formed from the EUI-64 by
   complementing the "Universal/Local" (U/L) bit, which is the next-to-
   lowest order bit of the first octet of the EUI-64.

   For example, the Interface Identifier for an IEEE 802.16 interface
   whose built-in address is, in hexadecimal, "34-56-78-9A-BC-DE" would
   be "36-56-78-FF-FE-9A-BC-DE".

   A different MAC address set manually or by software should not be
   used to derive the Interface Identifier.  If such a MAC address must
   be used, its global uniqueness property should be reflected in the
   value of the U/L bit.

   An IPv6 address prefix used for stateless autoconfiguration of an
   IEEE 820.16 interface must have a length of 64 bits.

   The IPv6 link-local address for an IEEE 802.16 interface is formed by
   appending the Interface Identifier, as defined above, to the prefix
   FE80::/64.

6.  Address Mapping

   In general, the procedure for mapping IPv6 unicast addresses into
   IEEE 802.16 link-layer addresses is directly not applied as described
   in [RFC1972], since IEEE 802.16 MAC header does not contain any
   source or destination 802 MAC addresses.

   In case of IP CS type, mapping unicast or multicast addresses to IEEE
   802.16 MAC addresses is unnecessary.

   Instead, in order to identify connections to equivalent peers in the
   MAC of the BS/router and the MS, CID is used.  In certain cases,
   multicast CID may be provided for in the downlink.  It can be useful
   to tranmit efficiently link-local multicast destination packets (e.g,
   Router Advertisements) from BS/router to MSs.

   So, CID or multicast CID may be mapped to IPv6 unicast or multicast
   addresses with TCP/UDP ports.  This mapping is dependent on how to
   implement it.

   However, in case of Ethernet CS type, source and Ethernet addresses
   are required to form the frame for Ethernet CS.  In such case,
   address mapping is the same as [RFC1972].

7.  Packet Transmission

   IEEE 802.16 is different from existing wireless access technologies
   such as IEEE 802.11, and, while 802.16 defines the encapsulation of
   an IP datagram in an IEEE 802.16 MAC payload, complete description of
   IPv6 operation is not present and can benefit from IETF input and
   specification.

   Classification is the process by which a MAC SDU is mapped onto a
   particular connection for transmission between MAC peers.  This
   mapping process associates a MAC SDU with a connection based on some
   criteria such as protocol-specific packet information, which is
   called as classification parameters according to [Section 5.2 802.16-
   2004].  For IP CS, the packet may be classified by IP source/
   destination addresses, etc.  For Ethernet CS (IP over Ethernet CS),
   the packet may be classified by Ethernet source/destination addresses
   and IP source/destination addresses, source/destination port numbers,
   etc.  This is dependent on how to implement it.

   Base Station (BS) generates the flow based on the classification (IP
   CS or Ethernet CS).  It also decides where to send the packet, since
   IEEE 802.16 connection always ends at BS while IPv6 connection
   terminates at a default router.  This operation and limitation may be
   dependent on subnet model.

   While deploying IPv6 in the approach described in earlier sections,
   there are four possible typical scenarios as discussed below
   [I-D.shin-v6ops-802.16-deployment-scenarios].

7.1.  Scenario A

   Scenario A represents IEEE 802.16 access network deployment where a
   BS is separated from a router, and a subnet consists of only single
   router and multiple BSs and MSs.  Current celluar-like deployment
   models, WiMax and WiBro, fall within this scenario A.

                 Fig. 4  Scenario A

7.1.1.  Unicast Transmission

   o Outbound unicast packet from the MS is always forwarded on a
   particular transport connection in the uplink direction to the BS.

   o When BS receives the packet destined to same subnet from MS but not
   to AR, the uplink CID is replaced with the corresponding downlink CID
   (which may be associated with the specified Ethernet addresses in
   Ethernet CS or IP addresses in Ethernet/IP CS), then forwarded to
   downlink.

   o Otherwise, BS decapsulates the 802.16 header and forwards the
   packet to AR.  In case of Ethernet CS, it will be delivered to the AR
   naturally since the destination address in Ethernet header is the
   AR's address.  In case of IP CS, the BS is responsible to deliver it
   with the proper Ethernet header.  AR performs routing and then
   forwards it to other BS or edge router according to the routing
   result.

7.1.2.  Multicast Transmission

   o Outbound multicast packets from the MS are always forwarded on a
   particular transport connection in the uplink direction to the BS.

   o When BS receives the multicast packet with link-local scope from
   MS, it sends back the packet to the downlink by using CID for
   multicast.  It also sends the packet to an AR after decapsulating
   802.16 header.

   o When BS receives the multicast packet with non-link-local scope
   from MS, the packet is sent back to the downlink by using CID for
   multicast.  It is also sent to the AR based after decapsulating
   802.16 header.  In case of Ethernet CS, it will be delivered to the
   AR naturally since the destination address in Ethernet header is the
   multicast address.  In case of IP CS, the BS is responsible to
   deliver it with the proper Ethernet header.  AR looks up the IPv6
   multicasting routing table and then forwards the packets to other BSs
   or edge router according to the result.

7.2.  Scenario B

   Scenario B represents IEEE 802.16 network deployment where a BS is
   separated from a router, there are multiple access routers, and a
   subnet consists of multiple BS and MSs.  If 802.16 access networks
   are widely deployed like WLAN, this scenario should be also
   considered.  Hot-zone deployment model falls within this scenario B.

7.2.1.  Unicast Transmission

   o Outbound unicast packet from the MS is always forwarded on a
   particular transport connection in the uplink direction to the BS.

   o If BS receives the packet destined to same subnet and to MS under
   the serving BS, the uplink CID is replaced with the corresponding
   downlink CID (which may be associated with the specified Ethernet
   addresses in Ethernet CS or IP addresses in Ethernet/IP CS),

   o Otherwise, BS decapsulates the 802.16 header and forwards the
   packet onto the wired network.  In case of Ethernet CS, if the packet
   is destined to one of ARs, it will be delivered to the AR naturally
   since the destination address in Ethernet header is the AR's address.
   If the packet is destined to MS under other BS, the target BS under
   which the MS exists should catch this packet instead by acting as a
   proxy of the MS and send it to MS by using corresponding downlink
   CID.  In case of IP CS, if the packet is destined to one of ARs, the
   BS is responsible to deliver it with the proper Ethernet header.  If
   the packet is destined to MS under other BS, the target BS should
   catch this packet instead by acting as a proxy of the MS and send it
   to MS by using corresponding downlink CID.

7.2.2.  Multicast Transmission

   o Outbound multicast packets from the MS are always forwarded on a
   particular transport connection in the uplink direction to the BS.

   o When BS receives the multicast packet with link-local scope from
   MS, it sends back the packet to the downlink by using CID for
   multicast.  It also sends the packet onto the wired network after
   decapsulating 802.16 header.  ARs will get this, and other BSs will
   receive this and send it by using CID for multicast.

   o When BS receives the multicast packet with non-link-local scope

   from MS, it sends back the packet to the downlink by using CID for
   multicast.  It also sends the packet onto the wired network after
   decapsulating the 802.16 header.  Other BSs will receive this and
   send it by using CID for multicast.  The multicast router receiving
   this will look up the IPv6 multicasting routing table and then
   forwards the packets to edge router according to the result.

7.3.  Scenario C

   Scenario C represents IEEE 802.16 access network deployment where a
   BS is integrated with a router, composing one box in view of
   implementation, and a subnet consists of only single BS/router and
   multiple MSs.

                 Fig. 6  Scenario C


7.3.1.  Unicast Transmission

   o Outbound unicast packet from the MS is always forwarded on a
   particular transport connection in the uplink direction to the BS/AR.

   o When BS/AR receives the packet destined to same subnet from MS but
   not to itself, it forwards to downlink after uplink CID is replaced
   with the corresponding downlink CID (which may be associated with the
   specified Ethernet addresses in Ethernet CS or IP addresses in
   Ethernet/IP CS).

   o When BS/AR receives the packet destined to other subnet from MS, it
   forwards the packet to the edge router, which forwards the packet
   accordingly based on its routing table such as IGP.

7.3.2.  Multicast Transmission

   o Outbound multicast packet from the MS is always forwarded on a
   particular transport connection in the uplink direction to the BS/AR.

   o When BS/AR receives the multicast packet with link-local scope from
   MS, it sends back the packet to the downlink by using CID for
   multicast.

   o When BS/AR receives the multicast packet with non-link-local scope
   from MS, BS/AR looks up the IPv6 multicasting routing table and
   forwards the packets to the edge router according to the result.

7.4.  Scenario D

   Scenario D represents IEEE 802.16 access network deployment where a
   BS is integrated with a router, composing one box in view of
   implementation.  In this scenario, a subnet consists of only single
   BS/router and single MS.  This scenario mimics the current 3GPP-like
   IPv6 deployment model.

               Fig. 7  Scenario D

7.4.1.  Unicast Transmission

   o Outbound unicast packet from MS is always forwarded on a particular
   transport connection in the uplink direction to the BS/AR.

   o When BS/AR receives the packet destined to same subnet (as MS) from
   MS, it does not relay the packet anymore.

   o Otherwise, BS/AR forwards the packet to the edge router, which
   forwards the packet accordingly based on its routing table such as
   IGP.

7.4.2.  Multicast Transmission

   Link-local and Non-link-local Multicast packet could be classified
   based on destination Ethernet address in Ethernet header (Ethernet
   CS) or IPv6 destination address in IP header.  (IP or Ethernet CS)

   o Outbound multicast packet from the MS is always forwarded on a

   particular transport connection in the uplink direction to the BS/AR.

   o When BS/AR receives the multicast packet with link-local scope from
   MS, it does not forward the packet anymore.

   o When BS/AR receives the multicast packet with non-link-local scope
