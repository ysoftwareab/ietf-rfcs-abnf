Abstract 

  The label advertising behavior of an LDP speaker for a given FEC is 
  governed by the FEC type and not necessarily by the LDP session's 
  negotiated label advertisement mode. This document updates RFC 5036 
  to make that fact clear, as well as updates RFC 3212, RFC 4447, 
  RFC 5918, and RFC 6388 by specifying the label advertisement mode 
  for all currently defined FECs.

1. Introduction 

  Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) [RFC5036] allows label 
  advertisement mode negotiation at the time of session establishment. 
  LDP specification also dictates that only single label advertisement 
  mode is negotiated, agreed and used for a given LDP session between 
  two LSRs. 
   
  The negotiated label advertisement mode defined in RFC 5036 and 
  carried in the LDP Initialization message is only indicative. It 
  indicates how the LDP speakers on a session will advertise labels for 
  some FECs, but it is not a rule that restricts the speakers to behave 
  in a specific way.  Furthermore, for some FEC types the advertising 
  behavior of the LDP speaker is governed by the FEC type and not by

  the negotiated behavior. 
   
  This document updates [RFC5036] to make that fact clear, and updates 
  [RFC3212], [RFC4447], [RFC5036], [RFC5918], and [RFC6388] to indicate
  for each FEC type that has already been defined whether the label 
  binding advertisements for the FEC are constrained by the negotiated 
  label advertisement mode or not. Furthermore, this document specifies 
  the label advertisement mode to be used for all currently defined 
  LDP FECs. 

2. Label Advertisement Discipline 

   To remove any ambiguity and conflict regarding label advertisement 
   discipline amongst different FEC types sharing a common LDP session, 
   this document specifies a label advertisement disciplines for FEC 
   types.  

   This document introduces following types for specifying a label 
   advertisement discipline for a FEC type: 

     -  DU (Downstream Unsolicited) 
     -  DoD (Downstream On Demand) 
     -  As negotiated (DU or DoD) 
     -  Upstream ([RFC6389]) 
     -  Not Applicable 

2.1. Update to RFC-5036 

   The section 3.5.3 of [RFC5036] is updated to add following two 
   statements under the description of "A, Label Advertisement 
   Discipline": 

     - Each document defining an LDP FEC must state the applicability 
        of the negotiated label advertisement discipline for label 
        binding advertisements for that FEC. If the negotiated label 
        advertisement discipline does not apply to the FEC, the 
        document must also explicitly state the discipline to be used 
        for the FEC. 
    
     - This document defines the label advertisement discipline for 
        the following FEC types:

Internet-Draft   Label Advertisement Discipline for LDP FECs   Jan 2014 
 
        +----------+----------+--------------------------------+ 
        | FEC Type | FEC Name | Label advertisement discipline | 
        +----------+----------+--------------------------------+ 
        | 0x01     | Wildcard | Not applicable                 | 
        | 0x02     | Prefix   | As negotiated (DU or DoD)      | 
        +----------+----------+--------------------------------+ 
 

2.2. Specification for LDP FECs 

   Following is the specification of label advertisement disciplines to 
   be used for currently defined LDP FEC types.  

   +------+----------------+--------------------------------+------+ 
   | FEC  | FEC Name       | Label advertisement discipline |RFC   |   
   | Type |                |                                |      | 
   +------+----------------+--------------------------------+------+ 
   | 0x01 | Wildcard       | Not applicable                 | 5036 | 
   | 0x02 | Prefix         | As negotiated (DU or DoD)      | 5036 | 
   | 0x04 | CR-LSP         | DoD                            | 3212 | 
   | 0x05 | Typed Wildcard | Not applicable                 | 5918 | 
   | 0x06 | P2MP           | DU                             | 6388 | 
   | 0x07 | MP2MP-up       | DU                             | 6388 | 
   | 0x08 | MP2MP-down     | DU                             | 6388 | 
   | 0x80 | PWid           | DU                             | 4447 | 
   | 0x81 | Gen. PWid      | DU                             | 4447 | 
   +------+----------------+--------------------------------+------+ 
      
  The above table also lists the RFC (in which given FEC type is 
  defined), and hence this document updates all the above listed RFCs. 
      
3. Security Considerations 

   This document specification only clarifies the applicability of LDP 
   session's label advertisement mode, and hence does not add any LDP 
   security mechanics and considerations to those already defined in 
   the LDP specification [RFC5036]. 

4. IANA Considerations 

  This document mandates the specification of a label advertisement 
  discipline for each defined FEC type, and hence extends IANA's 
  "Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) Type Name Space" registry under 
  IANA's "Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) Parameters" as follows:

       - Add a new column titled "Label advertisement discipline" with 
          following possible values: 
            o DU  
            o DoD  
            o As negotiated (DU or DoD) 
            o Upstream  
            o Not applicable 
           
       - For the existing FEC types, populate this column with the 
          values listed under section 2.2.
