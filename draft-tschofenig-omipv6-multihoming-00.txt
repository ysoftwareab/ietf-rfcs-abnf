Internet-Draft       OMIPv6 Multi-Homing and Privacy           July 2005


1.  Introduction

   Optimized Mobile IPv6 with CGA [I-D.haddad-mip6-cga-omipv6] protocol
   specifies a new route optimization (RO) to solve the mobility
   problem.  Privacy extensions for OMIPv6 added anonymity and
   unlinkability support to the OMIPv6-CGA protocol.

   This document combines these previously mentioned documents and adds
   multi-homing support.  As such, it offers an efficient and secure
   multi-homing and mobility support for MIPv6 using CGAs with privacy
   support.

   To provide multi-homing support based on [I-D.haddad-privacy-omipv6-
   anonymity] requires to deal with the following aspects:
   o  Ability to inform the other peer about the peer address set
   o  Ability to inform the other peer about the preferred address
   o  Ability to test connectivity along a path and thereby to detect an
      outage situation
   o  Ability to change the preferred address
   o  Ability to change the peer address set

   Additionally, it is worth pointing out that a new care-of address
   must be authorized prior to its usage.  The procedure detailed in
   OMIPv6 [I-D.haddad-mip6-cga-omipv6] and not repeated in this
   document.  Finally, the aspect of state indexing needs to be
   considered.  OMIPv6 selects the Binding Cache Entry (BCE) based on
   the Home Address.  The privacy extensions defined for OMIPv6 modify
   this state selection approach and use a specially generated "Sequence
   Value" (SQV).  Since this document builds on top of the privacy
   extensions for OMIPv6 SQV state indexing approach is reused.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Terms, such as peer, peer address set, path or preferred address, are
   reused from MOBIKE [I-D.ietf-mobike-design].  Terminology related to
   OMIPv6 [I-D.haddad-mip6-cga-omipv6] and its privacy extension
   [I-D.haddad-privacy-omipv6-anonymity] can be found in the respective
   documents.

3.  Strawman Protocol Proposal

   This document requires the following protocol processing:

Internet-Draft       OMIPv6 Multi-Homing and Privacy           July 2005


   Ability to inform the other peer about the peer address set:

      The MN indicates support for multihoming in the Binding Update
      with a new payload ADDRESS_LIST that is an extended version of the
      'Alternate Care-of address' payload.  This new payload also
      indicates the available addresses.

   Ability to inform the other peer about the preferred address:

      The source and the destination address of a packet directly sent
      to the CN is the preferred address pair.

   Ability to test connectivity:

      Procedures for path testing need further study.  This procedure
      ensures that a currently used path stopped working.  [Editor's
      Note: Some words about congestion control for concurrent path
      tests are needed.]

   Ability to change the preferred address:

      The source and the destination address of a packet directly sent
      to the CN is the preferred address pair.  As a policy the MN
      thereby decides about the preferred address pair being used.  This
      allows the protocol to work if stateful packet filtering firewalls
      are deployed in IPv6 networks.

   Ability to change the peer address set:

      The mobile node can change its peer address set at any time by
      sending a new Binding Update with a modified list of addresses in
      the ADDRESS_LIST payload.

   [Editor's Note: Detailed protocol processing rules for the MN and the
   CN will be described in a future version of the document.]

4.  Packet Format

   Editor's Note: A future version of this document will define the
   following packet formats:
   o  Ability to carry the peer address set
   o  Ability to indicate the preferred address
   o  Ability to add / delete addresses from the peer address set.

5.  Example

   [Editor's Note: An example will be provided in a future draft
   version.]

6.  Security Considerations

   The security properties of the extension defined in this document are
   based on the OMIPv6-CGA [I-D.haddad-mip6-cga-omipv6] and subsequently
   on the security of CGAs (see [I-D.ietf-send-cga]).  Privacy related
   aspects are discussed in [I-D.haddad-momipriv-problem-statement] and
   in [I-D.haddad-privacy-omipv6-anonymity] and applicable to this
   document.  Mobility specific threats, such as traffic redirectly and
   hijacking, third-party flooding and blackholing, are addressed by the
   base OMIPv6-CGA proposal.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require actions by IANA.
