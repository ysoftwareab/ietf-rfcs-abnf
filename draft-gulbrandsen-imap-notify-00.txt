Abstract

    This document defines an IMAP extgension which allows a client to
    request specific kinds of unsolicited notifications, such as
    messages being added to or deleted from mailboxes.

1.  Conventions Used in This Document

    The key words "REQUIRED", "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
    NOT", and "MAY" in this document are to be interpreted as described
    in "Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"
    [KEYWORDS]. Formal syntax is defined by [ABNF] as modified by [IMAP]
    and [IMAPABNF].

    Example lines prefaced by "C:" are sent by the client and ones
    prefaced by "S:" by the server. The five characters [...] means that
    something has been elided.


2.  Overview

    The [IDLE] command provides a way for the client to go into a mode
    where the IMAP server pushes notifications about IMAP mailstore
    events for the selected mailbox.  However the IDLE extension doesn't
    restrict or control which server events can be sent, or what
    information the server sends in response to each event.

    This document defines an IMAP extension that allows clients to
    express their preferences about unsolicited events generated by the
    server.  The extension allows clients to only receive events they
    are interested in, while servers know that they don't need to go
    into effort of generating certain types of untagged responses.

    IMAP servers which support this extension advertise the X-DRAFT-
    I00-NOTIFY extension.


3.  The NOTIFY Command

    The NOTIFY command informs the server that the client listens for
    event notifications all the time (even when no command is in
    progress) and requests the server to notify it for the specified set
    of events.

    Until the NOTIFY command is used for the first time, the server
    notifies the client about the following events (see section 4 for
    defintion): NewMessage, ExpungeMessage, FlagChange and (if ANNOTATE
    is supported) AnnotationChange.

    The effect of NOTIFY lasts until the next NOTIFY command, or until
    the IMAP connection is closed.

4.  The IDLE Command

    If IDLE (as well as this extension) is supported, the IDLE command
    is extended to have the same arguments as NOTIFY, and the server
    sends notifications only while the client remains in idle mode.

    Open issue: What's the benefit in this extension to IDLE?


5.  Event Types

    Only some of the events in [MSGEVENT] can be expressed in IMAP, and
    for some of them there are several possible ways to express the
    event.

    This section specifies the events of which an IMAP server can notify
    an IMAP client, and how.

    The server MAY omit notifying the client if the event is caused by
    this session. For example, if the client issues SETACL and has
    requested AdminMailbox notation, the server MAY NOT notify the
    client of the AdminMailbox change.


5.1. FlagChange and AnnotationChange

    If the flag/annotation change happens in the selected mailbox, the
    server notifies the client by sending an unsolicited FETCH response.

    If the change happens in another message, the server does not notify
    the client. (OPEN ISSUE: Should it send a STATUS (HIGHESTMODSEQ)?)

    FlagChange covers the ReadMessages, TrashMessages, SetFlags and
    ClearFlags events in [MSGEVENT].


5.2. NewMessage

    This covers both NewMessage and AppendMessage in [MSGEVENT].

    If the new/appended message is in the selected mailbox, the server
    notifies the client by sending an unsolicited FETCH response
    containing the information requested by the client.

    If the new/appended message is in another mailbox, the server sends
    an unsolicited STATUS (EXISTS) response for the relevant mailbox. If
    [CONDSTORE] is supported and enabled, HIGHESTMODSEQ should be
    included in the STATUS response.

Internet-draft                                            September 2006


    The client SHOULD not use FETCH attributes that implicitly set the
    \seen flag, or that presuppose the existence of a given bodypart.
    UID, MODSEQ, FLAGS, ENVELOPE, BODY.PEEK[HEADER.FIELDS... and
    BODY/BODYSTRUCTURE may be the most useful attributes.


5.3. ExpungeMessage

    If the expunged message(s) is/are in the selected mailbox, the
    server notifies the client as usual.

    If the expunged message(s) is/are in another mailbox, the server
    sends an unsolicited STATUS (EXISTS) response for the relevant
    mailbox. If [CONDSTORE] is supported and enabled, HIGHESTMODSEQ
    should be included in the STATUS response.

    Open issue: Would it be desirable send the UIDs of the neighbours
    after the expunge, like this?

         S: * 100 EXPUNGE
         S: * 100 EXPUNGE
         S: * 100 EXPUNGE
         S: * 100 EXPUNGE
         S: * 99 FETCH (UID 111)
         S: * 100 FETCH (UID 444)

    This would tell the client the UIDs of the expunged messages.
    Perhaps the client should be able to ask for this using an argument
    to ExpungeMessage?


5.4. OverQuota, UnderQuota and QuotaChange

    If the client has permission to perform GETQUOTA, the server sends
    an unsolicited QUOTA response containing the new quotas.


5.5. CreateMailbox, DeleteMailbox, RenameMailbox

    The server notifies the client by sending an unsolicited LIST
    responses for each affected mailbox name. If the mailbox name does
    not refer to a mailbox after the event, the \Nonexistent flag MUST
    be included.

    For CreateMailbox and DeleteMailbox, the server sends a single LIST
    response. For RenameMailbox, it sends two.

    Open issue: Should the server try to tell the client that a rename

    is different from a delete/create pair? How?


5.6. SubscriptionChange

    The server notifies the client by sending an unsolicited LIST
    responses for each affected mailbox name. If and only if the mailbox
    is subscribed after the event, the \Subscribed attribute is
    included.


5.7. MailboxMetadataChange

    Open issue.


5.8. AdminMailbox

    If the user has the right to perform GETACL after the event, the
    server notifies the client by sending an unsolicited ACL response
    with the mailbox' new rights.

    If the user loses the right to perform GETACL as a result of this
    event, the server MAY also send the ACL response.

    In all other cases, the server does not notify the client.


6.  Formal Syntax

    The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
    Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [ABNF]. [IMAP] defines the non-
    terminals "capability", "command-auth" and "search-key". [IDLE]
    defines the non-terminal "idle". [LISTEXT] defines the non-terminal
    "mbox-or-pat".

    Except as noted otherwise, all alphabetic characters are case-
    insensitive.  The use of upper or lower case characters to define
    token strings is for editorial clarity only.  Implementations MUST
    accept these strings in a case-insensitive fashion.

        capability      =/ "X-DRAFT-I00-NOTIFY"
                        ;; [[Note to RFC Editor: change the capability
                        ;; name before publication]]

                        ;; Is "AdminMailbox" (ACL change) needed?
                        ;; Add "LocationChange" - e.g. mailbox

7.  Security considerations

    Servers authors should be aware that if a client issues requests and
    does not listen to the resulting responses, the TCP window can
    easily fill up, and a careless server might block. This problem
    exists in plain IMAP, however this extension magnifies the problem.

    This extensions makes it possible to retrieve messages immediately
    when they are added to the mailbox. This makes it wholly impractical
    to delete sensitive messages using programs like imapfilter. Using
    [SIEVE] or similar is much better.
