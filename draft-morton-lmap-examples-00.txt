1.  Introduction

   The Large-scale Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP) working
   group has completed a Framework [RFC7594] and Use cases, and now
   proceeds with development of an information model
   [I-D.ietf-lmap-information-model] and data model.

   The IETF IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) working group first created a
   framework for metric development in [RFC2330].  This framework has
   largely stood the test of time and enabled development of many
   fundamental metrics.  It has been updated once in the area of metric
   composition [RFC5835], and again in several areas related to active
   stream measurement of modern networks with reactive propoerties
   [RFC7312].  The Working Group has developed an extensive set of
   Standards Track Metrics and Measurment Protocols.  Among the work
   especially relevant to LMAP is the development of a Performance
   Metrics Registry [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry], and a proposal for
   the initial regsitry contents [I-D.morton-ippm-initial-registry].

   This memo is orgainzed into sections that present an example of LMAP
   Control and Reporting by populating the various information model
   objects for measurement Tasks and Reporting Tasks (and eventually
   Schedule, Event, Action, etc).

Internet-Draft            LMAP Examples of IPPM           September 2015


   The first example is a UDP Round Trip Latency Metric.

2.  Scope and Purpose

   The purpose of this memo is to examine the features and capabilities
   of the LMAP information model [I-D.ietf-lmap-information-model] by
   populating the models with example data intended to enable
   measurement of IPPM metrics.

   The scope is to create the examples for Active Metrics and their
   Methods of Measurement, as defined in the IPPM literature of
   Standards Track Metrics.  Specifically, Metrics in the proposed
   initial contents for the Performance Metrics Registry
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry] contined in
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry] are the primary focus, along with
   existing standards track measurement protocols developed in IPPM
   [RFC4656] [RFC5357].

3.  UDP Round Trip Latency

   This draft presents information in a conceptual form.  Safeguarding
   correct syntax is a collosal non-goal in the early drafts.

3.1.  Measurement Task Capabilities

   Example:
   Measurement Capability [
      Measurement Protocol [
          Protocol Roles [ ]
      ]
      Registry URI  [
          Method Roles [ ]
      ]
   ]
   so, an example would be

   Measurement Capability [
       TWAMP [
          Control-Client; Session-Sender; Server; Session-Reflector;
          ]
       Prefix:Act_IP_UDP_Round-trip_Delay_95th-percentile_Poisson [
          Src; Dst;
       ... more URIs and Roles ...
          ]
   ]
   for a fully-capable MA.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations that apply to any active measurement of
   live paths are relevant here as well.  See [RFC4656] and [RFC5357].

   When considering privacy of those involved in measurement or those
   whose traffic is measured, the sensitive information available to
   potential observers is greatly reduced when using active techniques
   which are within this scope of work.  Passive observations of user
   traffic for measurement purposes raise many privacy issues.  We refer
   the reader to the privacy considerations described in the Large Scale
   Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP) Framework [RFC7594],
   which covers active and passive techniques.
